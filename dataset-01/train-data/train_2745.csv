1,Don't Even Woof At This Dog!,"This is the kind of film that gives soft porn a bad name. A juvenile ""plot"", poor dialog, and wooden ""acting"" - Ed Wood movies are better produced. Yes there's several naked women and a naked man, but except for ""Valerie"" they're not very attractive, and completely un-erotic. Don't waste your money: this French picnic needed more bread and wine and much less cheese!"
3,"Interesting, mildly sexy",A nicely paced sexual romp/farce. Could have done with a bit more edge but if you are looking for hardcore this is not the place. 70's genre softcore with nice looking actresses and interesing storyline.
4,"Soft-core, maybe hard-core, sex as art film","This is a great DVD to have if you just want to relax, kickback, and watch a sex art film done tastefully. And definitely a great film to watch with a girlfriend.From the amazing 70's, Jean Rollin's Bacchanales Sexuelles shows us how pure and natural a woman's naked body was back then when compared to today's siliconed breasts and shaved crotches. In the 70's, it was all natural: ""We've got bush!""Ah, the French women. The French women in this film are just delicious. There are plenty of sex and thankfully the soundtrack is mainly loud in the sex scenes--the moaning is drowned by the music. You can still watch this in loud (mono) stereo speakers without making your neighbors suspect that you are watching a porno flick or actually doing the wild thing.A great collection to have if you like the 70's."
2,Left a stale taste.......,"I was dissappointed in this latest Aunt Dimity. While the earlierbooks are charming, this one bothered me. The reason is the wayLori is developing. I'm not a prude, but this interest of hers inother men really annoyed me. In fact I frankly disliked her as acharacter. This is the last Atherton for me."
4,A fun mystery romp through Finch with Lori!,"A brief, but very fun and engrossing romp through the population of Finch once again and a short but satisfying mystery. The bits about Lori's attraction don't bother me. Anyone who's happily married shouldn't be bothered too much by these harmless flirtations. I'm a bit surprised by the backlash over them truly. It gives the stories a little sideline. Though I admit by this installment, the formula WAS getting a bit boring. And Nicholas was no way on a par with her prior romantic interests - including Bill or Kit."
5,"Traditional Homesteaders, Preppers, Survivalists","Some people think our ancestors were completely vulnerable and at peril without any medicine or remedy for even the most simple illness, cut or scrape. Not true! They had better medicines than we knew--check it out in this book!"
4,This book could do you some good and may keep you out of herbal cure trouble.,"Good book. It has some good suggestions, and very importantly, not a lot of dangerous advice. While our medical system is more often falling short, there is a lot of snake oil arriving on the `natural cures' bandwagon. The simple solution in this book could do you some good, and importantly, should keep you out of herbal cure trouble."
3,Short and too the point but still lacking...,"Don't let the title fool you, the list of herbal antibiotics is very short 2 herbs, with garlic being the main emphasis. Which means that even though this book is not very long, it's message could have been said in 10 pages or less."
2,Not for ameuturs,This book is for the advanced herbalist. These plants are not in my back yard and some of them I have never heard of. I never use this book.
3,servival info,tis better than nothing.Why the heck do I have to write areview? They aren't paying me jackto utilize my literary skills. Ifyou want this thing then just orderit.
4,Small book with good information,"This book contains useful information on some 15 herbal remedies that may help to defend the body against bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics. The top 15 antibiotic herbs listed in this book are: acacia, aloe, cryptolepsis, echinacea, eucalyptus, garlic, ginger, goldenseal, grapefruit seed extract, honey, juniper, licorice, sage, usnea, and wormwood. The author also offers alternatives to these herbs in case that you can find them, or that you can't take them for some reason.In the second part of the book, the author goes over the herbs that can help you to strengthen your immune system like ashwagandha, astragalus, boneset, red root, siberian ginseng, as well as alternatives.You'll find suggestions on how to prepare herbs, as well as recipes for making herbal teas (infusions and decoctions), oils, tinctures, salves, herbal powders, herbal sprays, even herbal soups."
4,"FAST, FUN, FANTASTIC!","F-Zero was my favorite game for the SNES, and I didn't think anything could top it. That is until I played F-Zero X! X is much faster, has tons of cars (each more sophisticated than in the original), more tracks as well as many small little improvements which make the game more fun. For example, there are now two ways to bump/kill other cars, making the game more difficult and fun. There's even a special Death Track option. And you simply won't belive the tracks: loops, tunnels, corkscrews, tubes, and much more. The programers have really taken advantage of the 3D capabilities of the 64. Magnificent!"
2,Not a Eureka Brand product,"Buyer beware, these are not Eureka brand belts and there is a difference in thickness. A Eureka brand belt measures 2.27mm thick while the replacements offered are 1.94mm. This I'm sure will amount to a shorter life."
5,Shania's Greatest IN ONE!,"almost every single shania song you sing in your car is all in this 21-song list of hits..you can hum Man!I Feel Like A Woman! and later drift into a Whose Bed Has Your Boots Been Under? mood or go through the tunnel of love with your loved one singing Forever and For Always to having a sweet,heart-felt tune of Don't!(one of the new tracks on the album)..Its that good a greatest hits! all the huge hits are on here..highly recommended to all shania fans,those to be, or those who wanna check out shania's commercial hits!...its cool considering that when artists release a hits album they only include like 12-13 tracks and one new song...but shania who so dearly thinks of her fans not only includes 17 hits but also included 3 new tracks including the mix to Party for Two offered in pop and country versions respectively...this is one heck of a hits package ladies and gents!"
2,Getting old,I think it's time that Shania Twain realizes that writing songs that sound like elementary school ditties is getting old and tired. And that love songs really should be deeper than the kiddie end of the pool.
3,"No surprises (well, maybe a couple)","Shania Twain's first album is the one to get. She was (pretty much) a country artist at the time. I imagine the lure of pop-country paychecks proved too much to resist. I hope that the next trend is a retro-country sound influenced by the likes of Alan Jackson and George Strait. I'd really like to see Shania take a chance here and there in her career. ""You might say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one...."" You should buy this CD if you want a collection of the tunes that maked me turn the country dial whenever they come on the air. Gimme some Merle Travis any day of the week over this collection of essentially teen centered pop. Where's the heartache? Where's the pain?"
2,Okie dokie,"I love Shania. I've seen her twice in concert. I listen to her all the time. She's one of my favorite artists. But I have to say she's releasing a greatest hits album way too early in her career. She only has 3 albums. I don't count her self titled as an album because it...well it sucked. I think money would be better spent buying the 3 albums that are featured on this greatest hits album than actually buying it. There are a few new songs. All of which are terrible. I'm sorry, but Shania can do much better. ""I'm Having a Party"" is a horrible song. I can't believe Shania and Mutt wrote that trash. That's even below Britney's standard. But all the old songs are solid gold. Buy the albums they came off of."
4,I dig it,"Most greatest hits collections go in chronological order from oldest to newest. It's different how Shania's Greatest hits disc starts with those from her newest CD (UP!) and go backwards in her career to the Woman in Me days, and then wrapping up with the previously unreleased songs. This is a great CD to listen to out on my boat on a sunny day. I'm mostly a really big fan of the upbeat songs like ""You Win My Love"", ""That Don't Impress Me Much"", ""Who's Bed Have Your Boots Been Under"" and ""Up"", but no one sings a ballad quite like Shania, especially ""Forever and Always"" and ""From This Moment"". There's definitely not a weak song in the bunch, I like both versions of ""Party for Two"", it makes me wanna dance and sing. Excellent collection for sure"
5,Great CD,Glad to be able to still get this CD - my original one was stolen! Wish she do a new CD though!
5,Don't pass this one by!,"A modern day Linda Ronstadt.Most of these songs are very upbeat,and what I classify as ""Feel good music"".I play it a lot.If you like Shania.Don't let this one get away!"
5,Country....Minus The Stereotypes.,"Forget all those cliche songs about Drinking, Fighting, Cheating, Suicide etc, Shania's not a cowgirl, or a redneck....she is a fine, classy lady who knows how to make a wide variety of original music, she can literally sing anything with that beautiful voice of hers and has enough personality, charisma and heart in her singing to give her lyrics a ring of truth and touch of sincerity.Shania is probably the most versatile artist out there today, from twangy country to cutting-edge rock, this CD is a collection of finely produced masterpieces. ...oh, and she looks good too! Although the difference between Shania and a load of other pretty faces in the music industry is that Shania's beauty stems from within and she has the talent and class to back up her great looks."
5,Shania,I love Shania's music. I started loving country music since I heard her music. Her music is inspiring. I love to play it at all times.
4,Greatest Hits,"This is a good collection of Shania's hits. 17 hits, and 3 new songs. Of course there's a few hits left out such as ""You've Got A Way"", but it's a fairly consistent collection. Hits include ""Any Man Of Mine"", ""If You're Not In It For Love (I'm Outta Here)"", ""The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You)"", ""Up!"", ""Forever and For Always"", ""Love Gets Me Everytime"", ""You're Still The One"" and many more. ""Party for Two"" is the lead single for the album, there is a country version with Billy Currington and a pop one with Mark McGrath from Sugar Ray. ""Don't"" is a very intimate ballad, and ""I Ain't No Quitter"" is the most country thing Shania has done in quite a while. A must have collection!"
3,Good CD,"This was a good CD, but I wish she would go back to her roots. While it has all my favorite songs minus a few from her other CD's, I really wish she would go back. I was comparing her with Jaci Rae's CD, Can't Push A River that I purchased here and really, I LOVE Jaci's CD. You should check it out."
3,Not that Impressed,"As a new country fan, not familiar with much of her work, even though I am 52, I wasn't that impressed with the cd.There were some nice songs, some pretty ballds, but there is nothing outstanding about her voice or songs to warrant one album selling 30 million copies.Her voice is pleasant but she has no range or power at all.My conclusion is her records were produced to appeal to the largest audience possible by being as bland as possible with somewhat risque lyrics.Is she really a country artist? The only really country song I heard is the last one on the album. The rest are as much pop, disco or rock as they are country.What exactly is her appeal aside from being very pretty?Needless to say I will not be ourchasing her new cd if and when she ever gets around to recording one."
2,Disappointing Music,"This is the first Shania Twain CD that I have purchased, but I was very disappointed with the musical content. Probably will not buy any other Shania Twain CD's."
2,Old Tricks Are No Longer Appealing,"Shania has really fallen off. All her songs sound the same because she rely on her husband to make her sounds, while she continues to write only cookie cutter songs. The new songs and the UP! songs are not exciting at all and shows that while the world contines to turn and change, Shania and Mutt has not. I was even surprise to see that despite this being a greatest hits cd, there was no write-up from someone on her amazing career. No write-up on how she changed country music. I loved ""The Woman In Me"" and ""Come On Over"" because she was hungry, but now it appears that she is only going through the motions. Sad...she could have been the Dolly Parton of her generation."
4,THIS CD IS GREAT {BUT} HER DVD IS BETTER,"THIS CD IS GREAT;BECAUSE EACH SONG IS A GREATEST HIT!BUT WITH HER DVD:THE PLATINUM COLLECTIONYOU GET TO HER THESE SONG'S IN STUDIO VERSION;JUST LIKE THE CDBUT YOU GET TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL SHANIA TWAIN SING THEM AS WELL!WHAT IS BETTER A SONG:OR A SONG WITH A VIDEO THAT HAS THE BEAUTIFUL SHANIA TWAIN SINGING THEM!BUT THIS CD IS PERFECT FOR WHEN YOU ARE IN YOUR CAR.OR YOU DON'TWANT TO SIT IN FRONT OF YOUR TV.PLUS IT HAS BONUS SONG'S ON IT.{TO PUT IT IN A NUTSHELL}:YOU CAN GO WRONG WITH ANY OF HER CD'S OR DVD'S(a fan of all kind's of music:ROME,NEW YORK)"
5,A Must Have,This is a great CD - it's a MUST HAVE. I'm buying two more for each of my daughters for Christmas. They're big fans of Shania and Also Billy Currington! Check this CD out soon!
5,Music from Amazon is Great!,I order a lot of music from Amazon and from Amazon dealers and I have always been VERY pleased with my selections. The item arrives quickly and is always packaged well. All my experiences have been very positive.
5,A Pretty Face with Undeniable Charm,"I have been a fan of Twain's since the ""Woman in Me"" album hit stores some years ago and since then she has exploded into something of a phenomenon. And so it seems the perfect time to release a GH album to capitalize on the mania, but to me it seems a little soon (with only 3 popular albums under her belt). However, this is the perfect album for those who never took the time to buy one of her pervious albums - the perfect opportunity to play catch up (so to speak). Most of the good songs are included, of course excluding those she did not release (It Takes Two) and for some reason the loveable ""When You Kiss Me"" is excluded. Also, I would have loved to see her Grammy nominated version of Dolly's ""Coat of Many Colors,"" but otherwise they're all here.The one thing that does not impress me here, however, are the new songs, particularly ""Party for 2,"" which almost makes my ears bleed every time I hear it. BUT, still a worthy buy any day of the week."
4,a must,"Best thing to do is to have all her albums, they are all great, otherwise get this great hits, any big fan of her must have it...cant give here 5 stars cause I'm mad...when is she going to make a new album? I'm guessing it will be a triple cd album full with all megahits LOL"
1,"Love Shania, but this hits package sucks!","I love Shania and think the new song Party For Two is great, and even better when it rocks with Mark. But the last song I Ain't No Quitter is awful. The worst song I think she has ever done. I guess I like the pop side of Shania more, than the country side. This cd has all her country versions and not the pop. So I was disappointed. I know the artists has to sway for the way country is moving, but I think it won't sell as much.Sorry Shania, release You Shook Me All Night Long on the rock stations, and you would be a bigger hit!"
1,WHAT A JOKE!!!,"Shania Twain is so beautiful, but this cd is a joke. I don't understand why people like her music. Save your hard earned money! SHANIA TWAIN IS THE MOST OVER RATED ARTIST IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC!!!"
1,BAADD.,"Shania, Tim M, Faith, and all the other ""country artists"" have ruined country music. Each one of them is responsible for commiting murder down on music row. If you want legit female country music, listen to an old Tammy Wynette CD. We need to turn country music back into country music. Shania and all her contemporaries have ruined country music. Too bad that all one needs now a days is good looks to get a recording contract. Where would that have put Waylon if he was to sign today? Would the late great Patsy Cline been good looking enough? If not and she was around today I doubt we would have ever heard of her because she is just average looking. And no don't tell me that todays country music is different--just listen to it. It realy isn't country music anymore save for a few artist such as George Strait. Please bring back countrt music the way it used to be and get rid of all the fakeness of country."
1,Not A Very Impressive Greatest Hits CD!,"I don't like Shania Twain's music. She should be a model, but not a singer! The only good thing about this CD is that it has the lyrics to her songs."
1,This CD Does Not Impress Me Much.....Actually Not At All!!!!,"I've been waiting for the release of this CD for a while, and I'm very disappointed! I don't recommend buying it, becuase you'll probably end up returning it the same day that you buy it! THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY!"
5,Excellent look at her career,"This album features all of her American hits from ,""Up!"", ""Come on Over"", and ""The woman in me.""every single song brings back good memories and will entertain you for hours. However, it would have been nice if they included one single from her debut album. The booklet freatures pictures from her past music videos. The version of ""That don't impress me much"" is the dance mix from the international version of ""Come On Over."" there are the radio versions of her songs, and they are all good. You won't regret buying this album!"
2,A long wait for a big disappointment,"This album could have been perfect so easily. It's better than no compilation but truly misses the mark. Here's why: 1) It's missing ""You've Got A Way."" Instead of 2 versions of the same ""new"" song one of those should have been dumped in favor of this classic. 2) There is not one song from her first album. They should have at least included ""What Made You Say That."" 3) ""You're Still The One"" is the country mix instead of the pop mix heard on the radio. That cool little flute solo is not here. (""Up!"" is also the country mix.) Since this collection is culled from just 3 albums you may be better off with the original titles."
2,"Eye Candy she is Great,but Musically","not alot of Substance to her. I give her Dap for working a style&sound that bridges Country,Pop&Adult Radio. she is smart for working those elements&having a catchy hook or Groove here&there. Vocally she has hd some decent moments,but on a whole take away the Production&cleaver titles&there ain't alot happening. Shania is a Foxy Lady,but Musically She is run of the mill. after Her first Album&a few cuts I just ain't felt her quite the same."
1,REMEMBER WHEN SHE USED TO SING COUNTRY MUSIC!,"I used to like Shania Twain when she sang country music! Now her music is POP and mainstream! Instead of being unique she has become just like everyone else. Don't support her, she is a sellout!"
1,SHANIA IS NOT COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGER,"SHANIA OUGHT TO BE SUED FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT FOR THE MOST SEXIST LYRICS SUNG ANYWHERE. SHE IS NOT COUNTY AND SHE IS NOT A SINGER.BUY ALLISON MOORE'S ""THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION."""
1,Shania is the best!,"Only the masterful Shania Twain can incorporate the two most deeply-rewarding and expressive genres of music: pop and country! Whether she's shrieking and giggling or whirling and feigning hick, I just can't get enough of this awesome country chick!Well, gotta go, my ferrets need their anal electrocution before Tess of the D'Ubervilles shows up with the goat milk!Buh-bye!"
5,Wonderful! Almost all the hits!,"This collection is fantastic. It includes the radio versions of ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman,"" ""From This Moment On"" and ""That Don't Impress Me Much"" (and probably a few others as well). Only thing I'm bummed about is that ""God Bless The Child"" was left off, as the single version was much longer and more realized than the album version, and they left off ""You've Got A Way,"" which is a beautiful song, and it was a bigger hit than ""Come On Over."" Other than that, this collection is fantastic, and the new songs are terrific."
3,worth a listen,This album was perfect for me as I've liked a lot of Shania's singles but amn't really such a huge fan that I'd buy all her albums. Its got all the hits I know and a few I didn't so am happy with it. There are two versions of Party For Two which I felt was a little pointless as except for a change of singer dueting with Shania it was the same.
4,JUST what I was looking for!,"No, seriously, this is GOOD! I got some birthday money and I wanted a Shania Twain album, but I wanted all her best songs on one CD. Then, this came out: It had all the songs I wanted and then some! It is just awesome. She has a great voice that's easy on the ears, her lyrics really flow together, and her songs are in a variety of sounds - not just all sound the same, like SOME of the artists you get these days!And my aunty and my mum like her, so finally I can play some music I like in the car without being griped at!A fantastic album, everyone whos loving pop and/or country music should sooooooo get this!"
3,Only some songs are good,"I like Shania Twain's songs. This is the second CD of hers that I bought. Of the 21 songs here, 9 are real hits, which I liked. The others are all just ok. So I figure it was better to get the 9 I liked from itunes."
5,Shania Review,"I would have to say this CD is a must buy, especially for shania fans. I have always loved Shania's CDs.. then when i heard she was coming out with a review i thought to myself ""ah! all her great songs in one package!"" All the songs just make me want to get up and dance!"
4,Love the new songs!,"If you own all of Shania's previous hits, it's ok...you'll still want to add this one to your collection. Her new songs are amazing and are a throwback to the ""Woman in Me"" Shania style. Love it!"
4,An early **Gran Tourismo**,The ratings terrible for this game perhaps because the people who do sit down and play it don't appreciate true racing. I decided to give it a try and so I bought it..the day it got here I wanted to play it right away so I did...alright so you basically get japanese touring cars some german and you race. I'm at my first race with an R-33 and I take of the engine sounds nice I get to a corner stick to the outside brake into the corner release the brake ease on the throtle and gun it at the straight away. I fall in love instantly. This videa game could be compared to good racing simulators like Gran Tourismo....I reccomend it for any one who wants a serious racing title for their N64. It didn't get five star though because it was too short and the sort of limited tracks and cars. Overall great game.....btw try this with a TILT PACK from pelican it turns your n64 controler into a sterring wheel which makes its even more realisitic...
1,Stay away!,"I purchased the download version of this video, and it is pretty much worthless. I am very familiar with most DAW's and, in general, the computer-based music environment. After watching this video, about the only thing I got from it were the names of a bunch of products they were using. The ""info"" the video provides could be found by going to the software manufacturer's website and watching an intro video about it, or just reading the features on the product page.When I emailed their support on the website to let them know that the content was obsolete and that I would appreciate a refund, I got a one line response of ""See the website for the return policy"". Since I did the download version, they apparently don't stand behind it.I would run away from this product, if you're considering it. It's probably the most worthless info product I have ever purchased."
5,use under paintball mask,"I bought this mask a few years ago to wear under my paintball mask, its still in good shape! Although I dont take it out every weekend, i have used it many times. Very breathable, and comfortable in warm weather. I havent used it in the cold yet so i cant comment on that. Overall, i like it very much!"
3,Nice but too small,"This is a vry durable, soft and nice feeling skimask, but, there is always a but, its to short, it wont cover ur neck, or at least not mine, and im not that big, i am only 6'0'' so thats my only complain, aside from that, its a very good skimask.Dr. Tomas Muñoz"
2,Not Durable or Made for Cold Weather,"I am very disappointed with this item. First, in moderately cold skiing weather 10-20 degrees fahrenheit, my face was a little cold through this mask. While skiing downhill, the wind shred through this mask. Second, after only 1 weekend of moderate use, the front of the mask was worn away. I would not be surprised if it tore during the 2nd weekend of use. Third, I have a medium sized head and this thing was wayyyy too big for me. Finally, the mask traps the moisture of my breath and freezes it, making the mask uncomfortable around the mouth area.The only pros are that it is lightweight and breathable."
5,Motorcyclist's must have item,"This is the second balaclava I've ordered from this source. Shipping is fast and the item has come well packaged and undamaged each time.I wear this under my helmet for several reasons: to protect the liner of the helmet from the natural oils in my hair and skin, to help keep my earplugs or earbuds in place, to stop the wind from making knots in the hair at the nape of my neck, and in cool weather to provide a little extra warmth. Since it's silk however, I can wear it in warm weather without overheating."
2,Too small and it's see-through,It was too small for my head in that the neck part didn't even come to the bottom of my neck. Plus it's see-through. My face and hair were visible through it.The only good thing is that it's breathable. Not what i was looking for though.
5,Terrible!,"For all those women who wants to know how its like living under the taliban gov't,this book is a must have. Here one can find the real situation of women living under the terror of the taliban,this book described the shocking truth of hell and one can never imagine how women in afghanistan were able to survived in this kind of narrow minded taliban gov't. Buy this book before they run out of print."
1,"Lots of mistakes, and boring","I was disappointed with this book. It had several factual mistakes, and when I buy a hint book, I expect it to be more accurate. Don't waste your money; guides I have seen on the Web are better."
5,Morini Alone is Worth the Ticket Already,"Recommended for :(i) the nice and rather easly listening repertoire;(ii) it gives us a much better idea of how Szell conducts;(iii) we could readily compare Szell with his successor Sir George Solti, and(iv) most importantly of all, we have Morini, one of the greatest violinists of the century (from the Viennese School) playing Mozart-- her footage alone is worth the ticket already, especially for those who have a ear or taste for the more refine and assuring sort of music and suffice to say that among all violinists of the past, Hilary Hann would particualarly love to see Morinin at work!The sound is indeed quite good and the picture is more than acceptable."
5,Awesome!,"Pryor has combined his own expertise from the archaeological field with a thorough understnading of the work of fellow archaeologists, (both in the UK and abroad), to present a vibrant, fluid and exceptionally informative look at life before Roman Britain.Where Pryor makes some ""judgement calls"", he is open and honest about how much evidence there is and some different ways of understanding it. He presents a variety of views.What you end up with a very comprehensive view of prehistoric life in Britain that does not get lost in reams of dry information. Pryor writes with an obvious passion for the topic, and that enthusiasm comes out in the writing.It is basically a great book, with loads of information. I learned heaps from it!"
4,Understandable archeology,"Many scholars can write only for other scholars. Pryor can also write for lay people. I really enjoyed this book.Archeology is interesting because archeologists usually find only bits and pieces of ancient cultures and do their best to derive a story from them. I've been to museums where archeological finds are displayed without much context. The artefacts by themselves don't mean much. In this book, Pryor provides a lot of context and it makes all the difference.Do we know all about the ancient Britons from prehistory? No, but as archeologists continue to put the pieces together, the cloudiness lifts just a little more and gives us glimpses into the long-ago past.Having said that, I'm in no rush to read Pryor's next sequential book. I understand that he argues there was never a Saxon invasion of Britain based on the lack of archeological evidence. Maybe I'm just not ready to have my thinking stretched that far."
3,A long and authoritative overview.,"Generally, this gives excellent, general coverage of a huge subject. The occasional personal bits and other mannerisms - inserted to popularise - can be tiresome, and there are indigestible wadges that are too specialised, for example on the field systems, and these might have have been reduced. Yet overall this is an excellent survey for the general reader."
5,Kris shows her stuff,"Kris McKay used to sing with the Indigo Girls at one time, among others, including Charlie Sexton. Ths CD was really great & under marketed & I am rebuying it because some one took mine."
4,Good one,"Real nice from start to finish Tasteful. Love her voice. Good balance between all the instruments. Accordion is good, too."
4,why so long,the first album (kris mckay sometime in the late 80's)had me calling atlanta to find out what happenend to her. this album is not quite as good. but still a lot better than 99% of the stuff that's out there. next to find out: tours.
3,A Valentine' s Day Winner,"If you are looking for a romantic gift for your Valentine, take her on a date and pop this CD in the car CD player on the way. It truly will set the mood. The music is senuous and haunting. I hear it playing in my head while I sleep. Jamie DeFrates has a wonderful voice and has combined his musical talents with some awesome musicians, including a violinist from the Jacksonville symphony. The keyboard background music by Sarah Deprin provides an array of other instruments which add to this CD's montage of musical treats. The jacket photo of the gypsy flamenco dancer epitomises the CD's Bohemian blend of songs including a nostalgic reflection on Paris during WWII (Belle Claire). My overall favorite song, ""A Woman's Dance"", is exactly how every woman wants to be admired by her lover."
1,Please don't waste your payday of this piece of plastic,"I would plead with anyone thinking of buying this game, not to. in my opinion it is the worst game i have ever played in my entire life. the graphics, well to put it bluntly, they aren't even up to par with the original nintendo. next the life spend of the game is about a min for there are only 7 tracks, bad ones at that. and lastly the actually gameplay is so poor, i had to throw the game in the trash and it wasn't even mine. it's easier trying to control a run-a-away train than those cars. so please don't waste your payday of this piece of plastic."
3,Somewhat amusing short term,"Bought this game and played it frequently at first but tired of it fairly quickly. Decent game, but 6 tracks doesn't complete with other games out there."
3,Childhood memories...,"I've always enjoyed this game for the open levels, when I was a kid my brother and I would play tag with the cars. That is mostly why I bought it. I forgot it needs a memory pak so I will have to pick one up but it is well worth it."
2,"A mediocre rally game, which is upstaged by Sega Rally 1 + 2","Although the 2nd best rally game on the N64, it is one of the most unremarkable rally games I've ever seen.The graphics are nice enough, although they can't compete with the standards set by either Dreamcast or PC, while the gameplay is both fiddely and uninspiring.The cars you're presented with at the start have no sense of speed whatsoever, and completing the first championship is a chore. The game picks up later on when you get faster cars (including a helmet?) and more imaginative tracks but frankly you won't care because by then you will be bored and frustrated.If you want a rally game that's ultra realistic and ultra playable, I suggest you try Colin Mcrae Rally on the Playstation. If you just want a racing game that serves as a big adrenaline rush then I suggest waiting for Ridge Racer 64. Or just buy FZero X instead."
5,SimpleDrive Hard Drive Review,"I have owned this product for 4 months and have been satisfied to date. It's a nice size for it's capability (about the size of a large wallet), and is rugged. It's USB powered, so is as simple to use as any thumb drive, however holds 100GB of memory so I use it as a primary back-up for my PC, and also as a music/photo storage media for ALL of my MPG's, JPG,s, etc. I'll likely never reach it's maximum memory capacity."
2,Profound Depth in Disguise,"I purchased this book, hoping it would be of the caliber of Richard Wilhelm's book... you know, something a couple inches thick with involved commentary. If anyone knows a medical I-Ching book like that, then please let me know. So the book is highly dissapointing. I wish he would come out with a practitioner's evolved version. Then even if it cost a couple hundred dollars, it would be worth it. Only the very top level of Dr. Shima's knowledge is expressed here. The profound levels are left unexplored."
3,A great idea--too superficial,"Interpretations of the I Ching have been used for many a purpose, and medicine is a very interesting and somewhat obvious application. The author is convincing that he knows his topic, however, I suspect he isn't revealing his depth of knowledge in this book. As a licensed practitioner of Chinese Medicine, I found the book to be accurate in Chinese terms, but far too limited and superficial. The language of Chinese Medicine is used here, and will be difficult for a layperson to understand unless they have done a fair bit of reading on the subject prior. The translation of Chinese Medical conditions into Western terms invariably proves inaccurate. The book is great idea from someone who I'm certain understands the topic, but somehow it doesn't really succeed."
3,I fear my rhyming days are through,"I got this album after hearing some of Christine's humorous songs. I was somewhat disappointed to find out that most of the songs on this album are serious. They are not bad songs, they are just not what I expected. And there are a few good funny songs. Christine is a clever songwriter, and fans of contemporary folk would probably enjoy her music."
3,Some Really Good Songs,"I bought this Cd for 'Constant State of Want' after it played on Public Radio. I am quite pleased with the album. Several of the songs are stellar - 'Jane', 'The Sixth Floor', 'Jagged Hearts', 'Scatter New Seeds', 'Something Wrong with This Picture' are all great songs. The others are not bad, just unusual - you have to keep in mind that Lavin is a humorist so songs like 'Waiting for the B Train' and '*69' tell humorous stories. 'Waiting for the B Train' is hilarious - about people standing at the subway when someone thinks they see a puppy on the track and trying to get someone to go get it."
3,Jagged Hearts,"The great thing about buying a Christine Lavin album (I guess I'm dating myself by using the word ""album"") is that even her worst efforts have at least one incredible song that so applies to you and the way that you feel (or once felt) that you just HAVE to own it, and then play that song over and over, until you've memorized the song, then you play another thousand times, just so you can sing along, and if you're lucky, you end up feeling a little better, even if you didn't realize that you even really felt all that bad in the first place! On this lp, that song is ""Jagged Hearts"". The others range from ""ok"" to ""pretty good"", and for you that one ""great"" song may be a totally different one, but Christine Lavin is one of those very rare artists that you can always count on to give you (at the very least) one song that you will never forget. How many others can you say that about?"
4,Help from one down the road a few steps,"My first question was, ""Did he bug my office and spy on me for year to get the material for this book?"" Serving in a rural area, it is easy to feel as if you are alone in pastoral leadership. Especially when it comes to conflict. After all, you are the new one in town. Gary Preston shares his personal experience (failures and successes) in a brotherly way that is helpful, not condescending. Specific anecdotes and ideas for living in conflict and loving in conflict are much better than just a list on how to deal with conflict. The author addresses two much needed areas: family balance and preaching during controversy. I find these (as did he)difficult but necessary mountains to scale in ministry.Good job, Gary."
2,"Small for a US passport, does not fit others at all","I ordered this and it seems to be nice quality, but it is too small. But it is a tight fit for a US passport (doesn't really close evenly) and simply does not fit many other passports such as Canadian. Also the storage flaps are both partial, so if you need to carry something important like a visa it would not be very secure."
4,A Plain Back Leather Case,Living in a border town I will be using my Passport more than I ever anticipated thanks to recent changes in the law. This will p[rotect my passport without adding bulk. And it looks nice and for the price the quality is excellent.
2,Acceptable but a little bit tight ..,"It has arrived on time and looks a nice shape and quality but it's a little bit tight to keep the passport. If you want to keep others such as credit card, other stuffs, it's better to buy others."
3,fits ok,I have been needing something like this for a while. I spend a fair bit of time in the tropics so my passport has gotten a little warped over time. My passport fits in fairly tightly. I hope the leather does stretch a little after a while. It seems odd though that you would insert the picture page of the passport into the cover as they seem to indicate in the photos. Doing so would cover the photo and half of the info. Putting it the other way around seems to make more sense. Seems a bit expensive for what it is.
4,Classic! Need a new XG for PS3/360,"I had this back in the day and I just recently replaced my missing copy. XG2 was a much better improvement over the original Extreme-G. To me, this is the best racing game besides F-Zero X for the N64. World Driver Championship was the the closet Nintendo ever got to Gran Turismo so I was stuck on the futuristic racers. I've enjoyed every minute of this game.I stopped playing video games for about 10 years and I finally bought the newer PS3/360 slims last year. My favorite racers are Forza 2/3 and Wipeout and I'm just aching for both a new F-Zero and XG to come out. With graphics these days, these two games would be a blast to play. As long as the developers don't try to over do them.Anyway, XG2 is a classic and most already know this, so there's no need to really run my mouth about it. Enjoy."
2,"Great game, for about an hour.","The first hour I played this game I enjoyed it. The next time I played this game I turned it off in five minutes. Controling the motorcycle is so hard! The game is too dark, making it hard to see. On battle mode the car moves tooo slowly. Rent this one first!"
3,"A nice, quiet read","Rinaldi has the most wonderful gift: she can take the tiniest, unknown aspect of history and make it as a brilliant as a star.True to her talent, she once again chooses a lesser known event in history and gives it depth and dimension.If you're looking for a highly devoloped romance, this isn't it. If you're looking for bloody action scenes from the Civil War... this isn't it. Instead, ""Sarah's Ground"" offers the point of view of a young woman and her struggle to remain neutral during the escalation of violence between the Union and Confederacy. She makes it her duty to protect Mount Vernon, where George Washington made his home decades before.This book is a quiet, relaxing read in which you can easily whittle away the afternoon."
3,"Story of a fight for personal freedom, and the protection of a landmark","This novel is a historical fiction, set during the American Civil War. It centers around Sarah, who is determined to lead a life of her own. Free from the demands of her family and society. Sarah finds an advertisement for caretaker of Mount Vernon, the home of the late George Washington which is falling into disrepair. Sarah deceives her family to pursue her dream. As war breaks out, Sarah finds herself in the middle of two fronts protecting a national treasure. The war brings multiple historical figures to her doorstep. Will Sarah succede in her personal battles in search of freedom? Will she be able to save Mount Vernon? Sarah's Ground is an excellent read for anyone. Highly recommended."
4,woo cohort 9,"I thought that this was an excelent novel for all ages. Sarah is a compelling character who brings determiantion and strong will of a great central charachter. The story is very accurate and gives the reader an inside look at the restoration and preservation of Mt Vernon. On the first observaiton the plot is shallow and basic;however, if one reads between the lines the plot takes on a whole new persona. Read and see for yourself."
3,Sarah's Ground,"Sarah's Ground is shown through the life of a young lady who is bound and determined to live an independent lifestyle. What better place to do that than lie about your age and get the job of caretaker of Mt. Vernon, the home of the first president. She there encounters the trials and tribulations of dealing with keeping the place safe while the American Civil War rages around her, not to mention having to deal with the day to day needs of the workers who work for her and a Southern Gentleman who she may have fallen for. Through out all of this, she somehow manages to keep Mt. Vernon neutral from the war and to keep it what it is today."
2,Boooorrriiiinnnnggg,"This book is SO boring just like any other Ann Rinaldi book except for ""The Coffin Quilt"" it was pretty good. Don't waste your time reading it because after a month you'll forget what happened in the book."
4,What on earth was Viz thinking?!,"I *LOVE* the Ranma 1/2 series, it is the series that officially launched me into the rabid ranks of the otaku (otaku = ""fan-boys"" for all you non-animé-watching heathen out there).The reason I am rating this set with 4 stars instead of my standard 5 for anything Ranma, isn't because of the quality of the animé. The reason is that Viz CHANGED the male Ranma voice actor for the English dub! I could *NOT* believe they did this. I have yet to be able to find out how and why this happened. If the original voice actor walked out for whatever reason, then I guess Viz can be excused. But if this was a case of egos or salaries interfering with a great product, then everyone at Viz should hang their heads in shame.Over-all though, you can just switch to the subtitled mode anyway (which I have now discovered I prefer over dubbed anyway) and there is no change. The stories are great, and the animation, music and most especially the jokes are all great."
2,Soccer,This game is ok. It doesn't have many things for you to do. After playing it for a while it get's boring.
3,missing piece and missing service,"I hear my granddaughter really likes this toy. The problem was one piece which did not fit right. My son took it to a wood shop and got it fixed. Your service was excellent as far as timely mailing goes, but customer service seems nonexistent except for my option to replace or return. Of course my grand daughter did not want to give up the toy. I just needed a phone number to someone at the company who could send a replacement for the defective piece."
4,Great choice for variable speed range hoods,"This Air King 30"" variable speed range hood in a semi-gloss black finish is exactly what we were looking for in the under $100.00 price. The 2 way bright/dim light setting rotary switch is nice as is the variable speed fan rotary switch. This exhaust fan is very quite at all speeds and can be easily directed to vent outside the house or recirculate into the house."
3,Decent,"This hood is decent for the price. It looks good and is pretty quite compared to other hoods I've had. As others said, the stainless steel is a bit flimsy, but it still looks good. I only gave it 3 stars because the single fan motor just isn't strong enough to collect all the steam/smoke that comes off my stove, albeit, I do some serious cooking). I do think it deserves 3.5 stars. Installation took about 12 minutes. I thought it didn't come with all the hardware, but found the other bag of screws back in the fan compartment."
3,RANGE HOOD,"This is a very simple, practical range hood that for the money is an excellent deal. The fan is relatively quiet and does the job. Nothing fancy. The first one I received was damaged during shipping and the customer service was excellent in re-shipping a new one. VEry responsive. Overall I am very pleased with this item and this transaction."
5,XYZ123,"Product arrived promptly 9 days earlier than projected in excellent condition, well packaged and brand new. Looks better than portrayed on Amazon images, solid built, sturdy materials within specifications. Looks excellent together with other stainless steel kitchen appliances."
3,Was great for the price!,"I bought this exhaust fan because I was on a limited budget and needed a fan! I chose this fan because it had infinite speed settings (similar to a dimmer switch)and other fans of the same price range only had high and low. It also has a dimming feature on the light that works great in the evenings in my kitchen when I just need a little light, but not really performing cooking tasks. Great price.. easy install... I did find the fan is loud on high, but rarely need to use that speed setting. Be sure you purchace the charcoal filter if not venting outside. It will remove the odors."
3,It is OK.,From the picture it looks no bad than that one coat $150. I will say it is OK for the price you paid.The deliver is fast than expected.When I open the box I found the plastic film was peeled away and one small dent. It looks like somebody had return it to the seller. The fan is touch the fram edge. It takes me some effort to have it fixed. The manufacaturer should be able avoid this kind defeat and make the metal work a little bit nicer without increase the cost.
5,Telling It Like It Is,"Although the writings of Robert Haldane are few, his exposition on Paul's Epistle to the Romans is a masterpiece and a lifetime accomplishment that is well worth adding to the library of any serious bible student. His ability to correlate Paul's declaration of God's Grace and the necessity of holiness in the Christian's life are well balanced and beautifully stated. After thoroughly commenting on the Epistle, Haldane included an epilogue dealing with the Christian sabbath and its perfect fulfillments of the types in the Old Testament Levitical laws. This writing is a must for any person who wishes to dig into the treasures of the Roman Epistle."
5,Gehl's Research is an excellent mix of Environmental Psychology and Urban Planning,"This is a fantastic book, putting substance and quantitative research behind urban planning. It isn't about the art of urban design, but how spaces are actually used, why, and what designers can do to improve cities."
4,Urban Design classic,"Nice little book. A good exploration of physiological aspects of urban design. The black and white images and drawings are excellent, really contribute to the concepts."
4,Olympic Hockey '98 is a fun game,I think that Olympic Hockey '98 is a fun game. It has a lot of hard hitting action. Olympic Hockey '98 is almost the same as Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey. But Olympic Hockey '98 has a few things that make it a bit better.END
3,hard hits but gets boring,If you find some codes you can have fun with some hard hits and also if you get the buttons right when you shoot the goal sets on fire. There are more special effects like that in the game but it gets boring faster than most games.
2,'My Name Is' Part 2,"Without a doubt, this had to be the first single released off ""The Eminem Show"" but it didn't quite have the hook that 'My Name Is' did. It's got quite a good tune, but it gets slightly repetitive. I think people who are all over this track aren't true Eminem fans, but have just heard the clean version on the radio and pretending to like it to fit in. This review is taking nothing away from Eminems rapping ability or the quality of ""The Eminem Show"" which is one of the best rap albums of all time. Buy the new album, there aren't any tracks you'll, just a few you'll get sick of hearing.Happy Rapping"
2,Poor Packaging,Amazon or whomever package the box for Wilson Golf 3 ring Chipping Game did not seal the content properly. Very bad packaging.
5,"A haunting, gut-wrenching tale of World War II","The story is Gregory Orfalea's search for who his father was a half-century ago. Many of us arrive at the time of our fathers' deaths and wonder what our fathers were really like. Greg began by looking up veterans of the 551st. Thus begins a haunting tale of a group of men who trained to the nth degree, fought the bloodiest battles, suffered unbelieveable losses and disappeared from the pages of history. The 551st attack on the last SS foothold west of the Salm River during the ""Battle of the Bulge"" compares with the charge of the ""Light Brigade"" at Balaklava, except that the 551st didn't have a poet to immortalize them. The Army simply sent the few survivors to four other airborne units and closed the book.Read this book to get an idea of how bad war can be. After you finish it, go hug your father, if you are lucky enough to still have him, ""buy"" him a cup of coffee and get him to tell you ""how it was"" when he was young."
5,You become a paratrooper in the midst of WWII while reading this book,"My father was in the 551st, and I bought this book for him. After he died, I read it and couldn't put it down. It's as if I stepped into his shoes and lived his battles firsthand. Not just some dry text...These guys were THERE. Collected stories of the men who served."
4,A wonderful tribute,"Upon the death of my grandfather, I was sitting around the house with my family and was informed of the existance of this book. I had no idea that my grandfather was part of a publication. I haven't read the book and it honestly isn't a typical interest of mine, but I plan to read it. My grandfather was part of the 551st and especially after his death, I find it an honor to be his granddaughter. Thank you, Mr. Orfalea. I'm sure you feel the same way about your father."
1,NOT EFFECTIVE,Purchased Bark Free 3 weeks ago. Device was somewhat effective for a few days. Since then ineffective on minimizing dog barking.
1,useless,Bought this product and the first day I turned it on it 'fried'. The burning smell filled the house. No use. Too expensive to return it.
1,One star only because there's no option for zero stars,"I bought one of these last year, and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor's yard. This device completely failed to stop the neighbor's barking dog. I could detect no effect whatsoever. Save your money, and try something else. I wish I could tell you what works, but we're still looking."
1,if i could give zero stars....i would,it actually works!!! for a week or so till dogs get used to it...... then you realize you wasted 100 bucks
1,My skepticism for this product held true,"My two collies that I love more than life itself are always on guard, and their protective instinct means that they're quite ""talkative."" I'm a natural born skeptic and, of course, I was skeptical about Bark Free from the beginning, but I thought I'd experiment with such a device and purchase one. When I received the Bark Free I followed the instructions and plugged it in. I had it set on the audible setting that emits a horrid squuuuuuueeeeecch whenever my dogs would bark. It actually quieted my dogs, but for only a few hours, they got used to it and were barking again. I set the device on the ultrasonic setting which supposedly is audible only within a dogs hearing range and at that setting was completely ineffective. Indeed my skepticism held water, the product failed. The product claims that it works with all breeds of dogs, obviously not! Don't waste your money on scientifically unproven devices!"
2,Not for us,"While I'm sure this works with some dogs, it doesn't with out bulldog. Her behavior doesn't change at all when it goes off. Bummer, we were really hoping this would help."
1,dont waste your money,we have 4 small dogs that when they get going the barking is unbearable. I purchased this items after reading the reviews. This item absolutely does not work. Dont waste your money
4,Worked like a champ,"I used to live in a quiet neighborhood with three yappy Australian Shepherds, one of them next door, and two more on the other side of it (so they were two doors down from me). I was skeptical, but the dogs were driving us nuts. I installed a Bark Free (before the Super model was released), and the dogs quickly learned to shut up. It was remarkable. They would still bark once or twice if they got super-excited, but it stopped nearly 100% of their bored ""I wish someone would let me exercise"" barking. I only considered using the Ultrasonic mode.My only other word of advice is that a competitive product, the Dog Silencer Pro, is a worthless piece of garbage, and even in ""Ultrasonic"" mode, it produces a piercing screech heard by everyone, including humans. Avoid that one at all costs."
3,"Works, but does have its draw backs","I purchased the BARK FREE device for my two 9 week old puppies. Beagles are known as barkers (well, all dogs are). I found that it really does work, on both the ultrasonic and audible settings. I did find that almost anything loud will set it off. Most advertising for this product says the machine can distinquish between background noise and the bark. I have found this is false. I have tried setting the device to high and low sensitivity, but this did nothing. The BARK FREE does work, but if it always goes off the dog will learn to ignore the sounds. I use it sparingly and this has worked. If you are looking for a total problem solver for your barking pet- this is not the product for you. If you've read up on dog training and use the BARK FREE as a support tool, it will work."
1,does not work,"The bark free does not work. I purchased on several years ago and it did not work. I purchased another one a year ago, thinking that the technology had improved, but it did not work."
2,It works but not the way you think!,Our neighbor's dogs like to sit by our bedroom window at night (3 of them) and bark all night. They said the barking doesn't bother them so they weren't going to do anything about it. While this doesn't seem to work very well on the dogs it does drive the wife over there nuts. They agreed to put their dogs in at night if we leave the Bark Free set so they don't hear it. That's how it worked for us. Problem solved.
1,"Not the book from Dr. Joel Wallach, Dr. Ma Lan","I don't believe that this is the book you may be thinking about from the ""Dead Doctors Don't Lie"" radio show. Note that the author(s) are not Dr. Joel Wallach and Dr. Ma Lan as you may be expecting."
5,Powerful Power4,"My body knows when I haven't taken my Power4, in my opinion I think that this is the best, I have tried the Acai but with this juice you get all four juices blended into one so you get the benefit of all of the super juices Goji,Acai,Noni, and Mangosteen. It gives energy and keeps your hair very dark. Give it a try!"
2,Zombie classic,"Writer/Director/Producer Barry Mahon, who gave us Santa and the Three Bears, started out with cheesy flicks like this one, better known as The Dead One.Despite the low grade script by Mahon, and the Grade Z acting, this was a fascinating zombie picture, set appropriately in New Orleans.John MacKay may be investigating fellow cops on ""Law & Order"" but this baby is in his early career. His wife, Linda Ormond, was probably too ashamed to make another movie, as was the zombie, Uncle Jonas (Clyde Kelly), who was the perfect zombie. he had the clothes and the walk and the movement down pat. He should be in the Zombie Hall of Fame, if there is one.Good for a laugh and a look at the career work of Barry Mahon, an interesting character."
4,decent edition of an important book,"Grant had a fine memory for details, and writes about the decisions that won the Civil War while referring to individual soldiers and trails through the forest. This book will be of most interest to those who follow the Civil War and military theory. I find interesting that Grant virtually never discusses technology in his tactical and strategic planning. The U.S. Civil War introduced machine guns to the battlefield, and observational balloons, and ironclads, but from Grant's point of view, none of these mattered. He worried about moving men from place to place, and probably would have preferred a single railroad to all the machine guns in the Confederate Army.The book may also be useful as a study of management style, as Grant obsessed over identifying great leaders and enabling them to realize their potential.This edition is well bound, but the maps are too small and are basically impossible to read."
3,"Read Grant's Memoirs, buy a different edition","Treasured as an American literary classic, Grant's Memoirs provide a remarkable record of his Civil War campaigns and are probably the best written military narrative since Caesar's accounts of his own martial endeavors.That said, Grant's descriptions of campaigns and battles are extremely difficult to follow without the assistance of good maps. Although the Library of America almost always provides my edition of choice, in this instance if falls far short of expecatations.The maps that are included show a level of topographical detail that require a large scale presentation to be legible. As reproduced on the small pages of this book, the maps are almost entirely without value. Therefore, to fully enjoy and understand Grant's narrative, you should either obtain a separate atlas of Civil War battles to keep by your side while reading this edition or else select a different and better illustrated version of the Memoirs."
5,A Masterpiece,"U.S. Grant's Personal Memoirs is a literary masterpiece, and one of history's greatest autobiographies. It is without question the best autobiography by any former U.S. President. Grant writes about the Civil War, and he does so with ironic, terse, brilliant prose. When described by most historians, Grant often--unfairly--pales when compared with his great foe, Robert E. Lee, but this book shows why Grant was such an excellent commander (and why he won). And when you remember that Grant hurriedly wrote this while he was dying of throat cancer, and that he was fighting time to finish it so he could support his family, it gives the book added poignancy. It is also noteworthy that Grant ignores his presidency. He only writes about his early years, the Mexican War, and the Civil War. This is not easy reading, but it is worth the time. Highly recommended."
5,A necessary addition to any Civil War buff's library,"Surprisingly enough, Grant could write. His memoirs read well and provide a fascinating first-person look into the life and personality of one of America's premier generals. This is original source information that is extremely well organinzed and interesting. While armchair historians and Civil War buffs need to stock this book in their personal libraries, General Grant's memoirs are well enough written to be of interest to the casual reader of history as well."
4,Maps too small,"Grant's writing, even the portion that was not thoroughly edited is very good. I bought this hard cover book because the maps on my Kindle version were too small. The maps in the hard cover version are still too small for my 79-year-old eyes."
4,An Interesting Read,"I had once read that due to the treatments for cancer that Grant was receiving when he wrote his memoirs, they were not particularly good and were inaccurate. Because of that, I put off reading them for a long time ... too long. They are extremely interesting and well written. I cannot speak to their accuracy but his memories are consistent with other accounts of the same events that I have read. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Mexican War, the Civil War, or American history in general."
5,Superb,"Well written history is a rare treat, and rarer still is a history by one who lived through it. Grant writes engagingly and humorously and with great humility for a man who achieved so much. That he wrote this in the throes of cancer, finishing it on death's door and yet has no sence of savig himself or self pity is remarkable. It's a pity there is no one like this in the elections."
2,Christian book,"I prefer when books that are so over-the-top-pushing-religion-down-your-throat, that there is a disclaimer somewhere. This book is not worth downloading if overly religious books aren't what you like."
4,Hannah's Vow,I selected this book as part of my travel material. I need lite interesting reads when I travel and it fit my needs
4,Good Book,Just started and its seems to be a good read. I'm a big reader and picky one at that. So for me to say its a good read then Its the best.
5,Great reading,"This was a book that captivated me immediately. The characters hold your interest, make you laugh and are so true to life. I definitely recommend this book for enjoyable reading."
3,Left out in the cold,"The Doctor takes a trip away from the TARDIS in order to spend some time on his own. Using the Jade Pagoda, he finds himself on Earth in 2006, where a threat from the past is at work beneath the ice: the Cybermen...The other half of a pair of novels with the TARDIS crew separated ('Birthright', which features Ace and Benny is the other), this solo adventure of the Seventh Doctor is written by David Banks, best known to Who fans as the actor who played the Cyberleader in several of the TV shows. He also wrote a book called (somewhat unoriginally) 'Cybermen', which detailed the history of the silver giants.Now, as a writer, Mr Banks makes a great actor... Unfortunately, the text is slow moving and the characters largely uninspiring. The end result is somewhat uninvolving, and unfortunately bogged down in cyberhistory.The most redeeming feature is journalist Ruby Duvall, a character who was a possibility for a future companion. But sadly, this was not to be."
4,Uncorrected Proof of Jim McKay's My Wide World,"This is a wonderful book about a wonderful man. His life, his professional attributes and passion will make Jim McKay live forever.I have an autographed copy of the uncorrected proof. I hope that it continues to increase in value and will allow all ages to reflect, dream and journey through the years about Jim's special memories in the world of sports."
1,Do not buy!!!,"I purchased the Metrokane L-Press Manual Citrus Juicer as a gift. The plastic cover at the top of the Juicer broke after ONE use. I called Metrokane Customer Service multiple times, left numerous voicemails with a return #, sent an email with pictures of the broken piece. Sadly, two weeks later, I have not recieved a response on this case. It seems to me (after reading another bad review)this product is not worth the price and the customer service is extremely dissapointing."
5,Don't go shopping for kids without the Oppenheims.,"This book guarantees that my kids love what I bring home. It's so well organized that I can look up the best books, toys, videos and software and know quickly what's appropriate for each of my kids. The 800 numbers are also great for finding the products."
3,Force Needed,I ordered this knowing that a lot of people didn't like the front cover. After I got it I looked at other reviews and how they got it to work. You have to use the quick force method to snap the top part on by the hinge. It seems to be holding pretty well now.
3,works well for price,"A good value for the part. Unfortunately, this is the 3rd one. I didn't buy the other ones here, but it seems they don't last like they should."
5,Great Ride for the Little ones,"I really enjoy this back pack. The stir-ups are wonderful and keep the little one from sore asleep legs. We use this often and it is still in great shape! I plan on keeping it so when my son has his baby I can continue to use it. I really recommend this if you are looking for a comfortable pack with a lot of storage and still is not bulky. I am only 5'4"" and enjoy using it. My child now weights 29lbs and we are still using it with ease."
2,Not much here of any relevance,"This is just a collection of the kinda random essays about how the author feels about the glock and topics realted to shooting. It covers no topic particularly well and seems like a cash in on Glocks. There's simply not much here. Big type, lots space on the page. Chapter titles include ""The Great Glock Watermelon Shoot"" and ""The Constituional Right and Social Obligation to Carry a Gun"". Unless Robert H. Boatman's innermost feelings are particularly important to you, skip this one."
1,A very ordinary effort indeed!,"This is one of the greatest wastes of printers ink that I have had the misfortune to read in some time. Regrettably, the content is fractured, the writing style poor and the level of information, average at best. If you want a trip through the authors tortured ramblings on politics with some side commentary on Glocks, buy it. Otherwise, don't waste your time. It's a fine example of a little knowledge being a dangerous thing. Buy Kaswers book, it may be slightly dated (ie new models have appeared since the time of writing), but at least you'll learn about Glocks."
2,"Should be called ""My Favorite Glocks""","The author definitely has his favorite Glock pistols and many of the others are just barely mentioned or given the ""stay away from this one"" treatment. He had his opportunity to redeem himself in the great watermelon shoot, where he and some colleagues took the guns out to the range and test fired them using different types of ammo and measuring the results with a chronograph . It appears that he only took four Glocks and one 1911 Colt along for the shoot however. Those were the Glocks in the calibers that he raves about.The author also lists his web site but it is nothing more than a porn site now.I did feel that his coverage of concealed carry and Glock accesories were pretty helpful although I can't see why an ordinary citizen would need to carry more that one concealed firearm.It's an ok read but if your in the market for a new Glock I would recommend that you dont use this as your only research tool."
1,Gun nut,I don't know why the previous reviewer thinks Boatman is an authority on Glocks. He mostly talks about his extreme right wing political viewpoints and skips over most serious information on Glocks. Most of the book is pictures with little real information. Unless you consider an entire chapter on shooting watermelons to be informative...
1,I hope his shooting ability is higher than his IQ,"Poorly written, self agrandizing, with racist and antisemitic undertones. It's morons like this that embarass the shooting sports.The information provided about Glocks when he did address the subject was superficial and of little use to anyone beyond a very rudimentary shooter."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"basically - It has some biased opinions and really seems to deal with the author's chosen few models. There was not the 'in-depth' factual discussion of all of the models that I hoped it would be and the way it was advertised. An Ok book - but I was let down at the actual 'total' coverage and fair representation of all models --- Not the Glock Bible as advertised! ...I feel as though I was conned by the hype and the ""Glock Bible"" status - more of a catechism and biased at that! Also slams Yankees too!"
4,Living with Glocks by Robert Boatsman,"As a Glock owner for some 16+ years, I found ""Living with Glocks"" to be very informative and the book helped guide me in my next gun purchase. Mr. Boatsman offers all the facts and his own opinions based on first hand experience to the reader. The reader can then decide which is the right model Glock for their personal needs. Even for the reader does not plan on buying a Glock, there is a lot of good information in this book that would be of benefit to any gun owner or some one who is considering purchasing a hand gun. A good resource and an entertaining read."
2,Unless you just love Glock - Skip this.,I would suggest skipping this book. The author's style is annoying. I found I could not get by the writing to get to the message. Skip it or at least preview it first.
4,Living With Glocks,"I found the book to be very interesting and entertaining. Boatman has a easy style of writing that offers an informative book without turning it into a technical manual. He does have strong opinions about which Glock models he likes best but based on his review I bought a Glock 27 and found it to be every bit as good as he described. If you like firearms and own or are thinking of buying a Glock, this is a book you will like."
1,"Forever will you suffer, indeed.","This is by far the worst novel I have ever read. The story rambles on with little or no meaning or direction. The dialogue is corny and forced at best and cringe-worthy at worst. Once the story begins to get even the slightest bit interesting, it veers off into a completely different direction. I hate to post such a bad review about an author's first novel, but someone has to because I'm beginning to think that every review posted here came from the author's friends and family. I hope this guy's next novel is better."
2,The Suffering,"Frank offers a wonderful debut novel here. The storyline is quite original and has great potential.However it does move but at a horribly, slow pace! The characters are almost cartoonish in nature, and the reader seldom cares what happens to them. Torture, pure torture in trying to get through this novel. There were too many words that could have been left on the editor's desk, or put into another novel.Maybe I'll give it another read later on down the road. But for right now, I can't handle the pain of sifting through this tome."
1,just plain bad,"This writer sure does write a lot of words, to say pretty much nothing. Skip this one and read a more established writer."
1,Gary Frank is an inspiration.,"Gary Frank's book ""Forever will you Suffer"" is quite the compelling first composition from this fledgling author. Compelling in the aspect that all hopes of churning out a provocative protagonist is immediately dashed within the first 20 pages of his writing. Frank's protagonist in this story is, by lack of any better analytical methods, a licentious necrophile. Frank's unadulterated mediocrity transcends the boundaries of horror into new unexplored levels of horrible. The only redeeming characteristic of this story is that it does, in fact, end. The true horror of the book is that, by the assumption of the title, I would be forces to suffer through reading this ridiculous garbage for the rest of eternity. Gary Frank has proven to me that any miserable, talent-less writer can get published, and for this reason has vanquished my own fears of writing a novel. Thanks for the bout of inspiration."
4,Big Girl Knits,"The text offers very helpful information, has great advise to Big Girls and compensates for the designs. I did not find the majority of the designs flattering or appropriate for Big Girls."
5,Great overall,"The best book of its type on the market. The styles and yarn selection are flattering and contemporary and the size ranges are realistic. I want to knit almost everything in here. Some of the measuring and alteration instructions are a bit more complicated than necesssary, but still highly recommended."
5,"Some interesting styles, and a very positive philosophy","I am a beginning knitter, which places most of these styles beyond me at this point in time. I look forward to attempting some of these styles as I become a more experienced knitter, especially the cardigan with the diagonal varicolored panels in the front.However, I LOVE the use of large-sized models who are self-assured in their largeness, even in the tighter and clingier styles. ""Making it Big"" has the same kind of self-assured, confident models; wish some of the other large-size catalogues did (grumble).Some of the styles in this book appeal to me very strongly; others less so (many fashion options in the book for many tastes, which is good), but I really like the in-your-face large models. The book is positive and large-affirming, and we need THAT as much as we need fashion options which will fit us. We really ARE everywhere."
2,well there are 25 projects,"too bad they aren't winners.the only thing I really liked about this book were the first 30 pages (what everyone calls the first four chapters)that talk about fit. not worth the 30 dollar price tag (that would be 1 dollar/page for all I would want). maybe if they ever release that section as a pamphlet I would pick it up, but the projects just aren't interesting enough to overlook the price"
5,Phenomenal knitting projects for large women!,"I totally LOVE this book! It has some really beautiful knitting projects in it for large women, some in sizes up to 6X. I can't wait to dive into a project from this book. One of the writers is from Knitty.com, and they both have good taste when it comes to what would look good on women that have big butts, wide hips, large tummies, and are really well endowed when it comes our chests."
3,Adding to my library,I bought this one as my daughter-in-law has another by this author and has enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to choosing something to get started on for myself.
5,If your not a size 8 this will be the last knitting book you have to buy!,"Where to start? The style tips on what to wear and where on the body to put it? The knitting tips on how to emphasize the assets and disquise the flaws? The over abundant humor of the writers? It's hard to pick.The entire book is well worth the price. I have an entire library of knitting books and this will be by far my fave book. This is the first knitting book (magazine) that I have gotten that I want to knit everything in it!I stayed up past midnight the day I bought it, pouring over it in depth. It's chock full of how to's, not do's, yarns to use, yarns to avoid, purse size to wear, where to put a hem, what type of hem to use, etc.I could happily knit from this for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, I'm greedy and want a sequel to it already and I haven't even owned the book 24 hours yet!"
2,I was disappointed,"The first four chapters on 'What you need to know' have useful design information. I cannot imagine wearing any of the styles as they are, but I can imagine using the basic shapes etc to design my own knits. The models are very good, it's great to see what the garments look like on fat women rather than thin women."
1,"Way too ""funky""","I returned this book as I found all of the patterns to be way too ""funky"" for my taste. There was absolutely nothing in it that I would ever knit."
2,designs don't follow the book's own advice,"This book has a lot of really good fashion tips for ""big girls"". What to wear that is flattering on plus-size body types, etc.The designs in this book do not follow that advice, however. Many of the designs look like tents, and make the models actually look fatter. A huge, knitted version of the muu-muu is not going to be flattering on anyone, especially not a 3X or 4X woman, as most of the models in the book were. My other complaint, which may not bother some other readers, was the fact that most of the designs and models were on the mid- to larger end of the size range given in the book. As a woman who usually falls just a few inches past the sizing for regular Misses' knitting patterns, I would have liked to have seen some of the designs in this book szied down onto size XL or 1X models.In all, I was so disappointed in this book. It could have done so much more. There is not one pattern in it that I'd make."
1,Big Girls Knit Ugly Sweaters,"I bought this book site unseen as I was excited that there would be a nice book of patterns for big girls like me. Well, they are not patterns for women like me. I thought that almost without exception the sweaters were not attractive and did not enhance the appearence of the models. Please also note that apparently big girls do not go much above a 52 inch finished bust size. Now I am about a 53 inch bust but a girls gotta have some wearing ease! Big disappointment. I think I want my money back."
2,Abrasive,I find this book informative and vulgar. The authors' use of inappropriate inuendoes and offensive language destroyed any desire to support their efforts at having written this book. Sometimes trying to be funny when you are not only makes the attempt worse. As a confident full bodied woman I have no need for such demoralizing humor. The book was returned...and yes I do appreciate the authors' attempts at creating knitting patterns for women of substance.
4,Very good,"This book has many good patterns. I like how they describe honestly which ones are best for which figures. They have very few ""what where they thinking"" patterns, much fewer than many i have seen. I love that they have not forgotten that ""real"" women wear skirts, shawls and such and are sexy to boot."
4,Technique is more valuable than pretty patterns.,"This book is worth it for the advice on altering patterns alone. I don't plan on making any of the garments in the book but it has empowered me to make other sweaters that i was scared to do because of the sizing. Making sweaters is a big investment in time and money and the last thing i want is to make something that would fit badly. I also like that this book isn't just for plus sized ladies, but for anyone who may have a body part that puts them out of the average proportion for which designers make patterns."
4,Good Book,Excellent Book for young boys (bought this for my nephew) but also for adults who enjoyed books like Treasure Island or Count of Monte Cristo. Very enjoyable to read.
4,a pretty good book so far,I'm only 5 or more chapters into it but it is a good book so far. wish he had gone back in time already but i guess all good things come in time and patience.
5,great page turner,"You do not find books like this any more. You can be a kid again in this book. You are pulled into every page. I have read all of Ted Bells books, but Nick of Time is so different you can't wait to turn the page."
4,A solid choice,"I liked this book a lot. It was a mixture of some of my favorite kinds of books. The characters were well done and the plot was exciting. There were a lot of twists and turns and holding my breath.It was a bit bloodier than I thought it would be. I wouldn't read it to young children, probably 12 on up. It deals with the reality of war - it's not pleasant but the author doesn't dwell on it and make it disgusting. There is also a really bad guy and he does mean things and causes pain to many people so sensitive kids may not like it.I will recommend this to my sons when they're a little older. And I'd readily recommend it to all of my adult friends as it was a fantastic book.*taken from my review at goodreads"
2,No much,I had to give up on this one. Had too many good books to read. I expected more from Ted Bell
5,Blows Harry Potter Away,A children's book that adults can enjoy. Full of action. A real page turner. Makes Harry Potter seem anemic.
4,smitty,"I have read Ted Bell's novels prior to this one and even tho i thought it might have been written for a junior I felt that it was highly enjoyable. The enjoyable action was there but it did not have the female relationships that Lord Hawke had in his exploits, as I felt the later novels were meant for a more mature readership."
5,My 9 year old loves this serires,"My son 9 at the time now 11 loved, and still loves this series. He does not realize that he is receiving a pseudo history lesson to boot. :)"
5,great adventure novel,"A good adventure novel for young adults, male or female. I have two teenage daughters and both love the Ted Bell books."
2,A very juvenile story.,Nick of Time by Ted Bell.Very juvenile. It is a good book for a 10 yr. old.Not what I expected after reading other books by Bell.
1,Isnt this a bit pricey?,"WOW!... Should I read this on my Kindle and pay $7.18 in HARDCOVER and actually own a book that I can read and then give away to friends or just pay $7.99 (81 cents MORE!) and have it electronically delivered with NO paper and NO chance of just giving it away to whomever I want!?! What a conundrum! Again, the publisher is RAPING the Kindle user to sell their product..."
2,11 yr old won't read it,"I bought this because it was rated as a best seller, and because it incorporated historical fiction into the story, but it didn't hold my 11 yr old's interest into the 3rd chapter."
4,bold action,"I wish there were more books like this out there for younger audiences. 'Nick of Time' is full of action in a rich, historical setting. Some of the action gets a bit grisly, but in my opinion this only strengthens the book. I'm glad there are some authors and publishers who's first priority is not the sterilization of material (dumbing it down in the pursuit of making it ""safe"" for everyone. This book isn't ""safe"", it's bold and I'm glad.) I recommend it along with others like 'the dangerous book for boys' and 'the edge chronicles.'"
4,Enjoyable!,This was a very good and exciting book. I enjoyed reading it. The book is well written and has an interesting plot that will keep you reading for hours! Philip (age 14)
1,Interesting that he started this way...not what I'd thought,"Over the years I've read just about everything Heinlein wrote, & at the time had enjoyed each and every one. I read them between about age 16 and age 30(?). I'm now 49, & when I look back on them, I find the earlier ones much better; that's how my personal worldview has evolved. His later works delved deeply into the worldview we see in this book. I had thought his views had evolved into that over the years; now I see he'd always had this, & ""hid"" it somewhat for a time, until he'd reached a level of success that allowed him to be more direct. For me, it made this book an extreme let down. To bottom line it - if you like his later novels you'll enjoy this, the genesis of it all. If however, like me, you prefer his earlier works, you won't enjoy it. If you're in the latter camp, just give it a miss."
1,Only for die-hard Heinlein fans,"I've read nearly all of Heinlein's work (and really liked most of it) and this is clearly the worst of his novels. Positively a first novel...no plot, little characterization and page after plodding page of his libertarian rantings. Interesting if you're a died-in-the-wool-he-can-do-no-wrong-and-he's-the-best-writer-of-the-20th-century Fan (with a capital F), but otherwise get it out of your local library and save your money."
1,For die-hard Heinlein fans only,"There isn't much story to this story, and there sure isn't any comedy, but for the Heinlein fan who just can't get enough of Heinlein's criticism of 20th century politics, sex, religion and economics - well, this book's for you!"
2,"For Us, the Living","I can see why this book was not picked up by a publisher in 1939. It is quite possibly the worst Heinlein book I have ever read and I own the hardbounds off ALL of his work except this one. There is too much pontification and very little applied to plot and character. Sometimes it doesn't even sound like the Heinlein we all know and love. My life would have been complete without ever knowing this book existed. If you are a Heinlein fan, it would be good to read this in order to feel the nexus of the rest of his work. But, as a stand alone book, it sucks pretty badly."
1,Perhaps better left for dead...or at least published with a warning label,"I'm a huge fan of Heinlein. He helped shape me in many different ways. THIS book, however, should have been published with a disclaimer ""only for long-time Heinlein fans"".I shudder to think that when it first came out, people read this and never read anything else by him.Yes it is interesting to ME, but if you have to read the reviews to decide whether or not to read it (as opposed to reading it JUST because Heinlein wrote it) then the answer is simple: DON'T!"
2,always a preacher,"One suspects that the major reason for suppressing this piece was not the cannibalization of it in later works, but its revelation of R H as an advocate of left-wing ideas, as well as social credit, a funny money scheme that might be called ""demand side"" economics.Lots of later R H ideas there. For a comparable novel one might look at the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies.skim and enjoy, if you have read lots of R H. His career moved in a circle in terms of technique and horizontally in terms of politcs."
2,"not a good novel, but interesting for fans","It is pedantic and full of lectures. It's a mildly interesting short story that has been stretched to a novel. It's even harder to understand the character motivations than his later works.HOWEVER as the review says, it has a lot of the threads of his later works, and as such is interesting. If you have not read his ""Tramp Royale"" and understanding more about Heinlein is of interest, read Tramp first. It's a travelogue of a trip he took around the work in 1953 and it benefits from better writing and a more interesting storyline."
3,"His style, but not usual quality","A man from 1939 is transported to 2086 for good. He must learn about the world as it is in 2086. That's what most of the book is about. At least four of the chapters are him talking with whatever expert of 2086; in this Platonic manner, we get lectured on Heinlein's opinions on the faults (in his day) as he saw them in politics, religion, marriage, and the economy. It becomes rather boring after a while, because no action is happening, no plot is really proceeding. It started out as a decent story with his relationship with Diana, but really never got any deeper.It was, however, very interesting to see Heinlein's predictions for the future. Some were dead on, some were completely off. I particularly liked how everyone smoked and the engineers wore asbestos uniforms. And by 2086 we hadn't yet flown to the moon. The Heinlein of 1939 would have been flabbergasted to learn of the internet and Google."
3,Don't make this your first Heinlein read.,"Like the title says, don't make this your first Heinlein read, or even your second. My only experience with Heinlein before reading this was Starship Troopers(loved it) and this book almost turned me off completely to Heinlein. After reading reviews of the book i came to understand that this book is not the norm for the author and isn't really representative of his work as a whole.Steer clear until you've read some of his other work or possibly just ignore it all together unless you absolutely must read all of his books."
3,"For Us, the Fans","I will begin this review with one simple statement - if you are not a Heinlein fan then don't read this book. This book is a very average novel.However, before I put too many people off, let me quantify those statements. If you are interested in Heinlein and Heinlein's mind, then you should definitely get this book. However, don't expect an enoyable yarn. The value that this book brings is through the insights you gain into Heinlein himself. In this book you see the roots and ideas that formed so many of his works that followed.I must say that despite the story being rather average, I did find some enjoyment in reading this book. If you're a Heinlein fan and want to see the grand master at his earliest, when novels like Starship Troopers were seeds of ideas waiting to grow, then get this book and you may get some enjoyment out of it too."
3,"Ok It's a bad novel, buy it anyway","It is pedantic and full of lectures. It's a mildly interesting short story that has been stretched to a novel. It's even harder to understand the character motivations than his later works.HOWEVER as the review says, it has a lot of the threads of his later works, and as such is interesting. If you have not read his ""Tramp Royale"" and understanding more about Heinlein is of interest, read Tramp first. It's a travelogue of a trip he took around the work in 1953 and it benefits from better writing and a more interesting storyline."
2,Maybe should have remained the lost novel,"From what I can gather from various sources (the jacket of this book, reviews of SF writers), Heinlein was one of the foremost science fiction writers of the 20th century. However, this book does little to bolster those claims.What at first seems to be a time-warp tale with endless possibilities morphs into a series of soliloquies, lectures and endless drivel. Some of the ideas and concepts are amazing (national credit, the emergence of television and e-mail) considering the time in which the book was written. However, the characters are fairly flimsy and their conversations hardly believable. The characters don't interact or converse as much as they spew endless monologues at each other. While at times interesting, it makes for a very difficult read.Introducing myself to Heinlein through this book was my mistake. Don't make it yours. Luckily, this one novel won't turn me off to Heinlein's work; I'll seek him out again."
2,Not your typical Heinlein Work,"Definitley not your typical Heinlein work, as usual he creates his own future and writes to it. In this case he takes someone from 1939 and moves him to 2086 and provides him re-education so he fits in. There is a massive section (probably 5 times the lenth of any college term paper), on economics. I ended up skipping the entire introduction and at least 1/3 of the book just to get to the end and see if there was anything interesting. Certainly not a book I would recommend for any RAH fan."
3,Very General,"A decent overview of the independent bookstore business. The book provides plenty of checklists, general rules of thumb, business plan information, issues and challenges. The book itself is relatively basic, and I wish it dove into more specifics on the details of the business itself. Many of the checklists and advice are good for ANY business - but I was hoping for more bookstore specific information and checklists. If you are thinking of getting in the business and have limited business and bookstore exerience, this might be a good reference."
3,Not really suitable for me,"i'm still hangin with what i have planning before which is open a bookstore. about this book, it's really suitable for those who have cash in hand to become a bookstore owner, for those who just plan you better generate your cash first before go through this book."
4,"FUN,FUN,FUN!","Hello everyone. Casper is a game for pure HOURS of enjoyment. Collecting items, figuring out puzzle pieces to open rooms,gates,etc. What i like most about casper is how close it is to the movie and when you play it, it is never played the same way if you happen to start over again. The graphics is awesome! There are so many things to explore. I'm 30yrs old and I enjoy it and if I enjoy it,so will you and your kids. It's a game for ALL ages. Happy searching."
3,casper,"This game is a good challenge, along with solving differnt tasks, it is entertaining as well. The game I purchased used was in excellent playing condition, and shipping was very prompt. Thanks"
3,Casper PS1,"I used to have this game when I lived in the UK. Used to find it fun. It doesn't work on my PS2, which it should....I left it too long to return it.#"
3,good game for people who don't play video games well,I love this game but i am not a video gamer. I am probably the worst gamer ever. This game is easy to understand and play and I enjoy it.
2,A good manga spoiled by the ending,"This manga began as a cute, fluffy tale with spots of humor now and then and a truly endearing character in Night, the robot who falls in love...but then I read the ending online. BEWARE! It'll break your heart, and not in a good way. Don't get sucked in, don't waste your money. Yuu Watase blew it with this one."
1,Be cautius!!!,"This book was very innapropriate, I read and I hated it deeply. Throughout the book mature things are talked about, and this book deserves much higher than it's teen rating. I'm not a parent, but if you are, I would advise you to keep your children away from these books. They don't even have much of a plotline! This book would make a good example of manga gone BAD!"
1,this game sucks,"do you enjoy very SLOW moving race games where it feels like youre coasting uphill on a turtle with a broken leg?or maybe you like really crappy weopons or even worse animation.or how about my all time pet peeve,no idea about how to do stuff because theres just no easy way to tell.well,youll find all that and more.buy it if you like.wait a week to get it.play it for like 5 minutes and then take a nap controler in hand.they should have called this one n64 induced coma."
4,That's fast!,"How can you not love Wipeout? This game blew my mind. I was skeptical first getting it, due to the fact that I had the previous Wipeout games on PlayStation, but that left quickly as I saw the N64 at work. While not quite as good looking as on the PS (But enough of the PS comparisons...), it sure was a hell of a lot of fun. Graphics are very impressive, especially when flying through the tunnels on Dyroness. And did I mention speed?... I DARE you to try going full blast on Phantom... This game is best experienced with the lights turned down and volume at full blast. The only gripe I have is that it gets a little too easy once you get the...well, will let you find out for yourself (Getting ""It"" is a challenge worth the rewards.) A lot of fun, and definitely worth the buy."
4,Pretty Good for a racing game,"This is a really good racing game. Although it does sorta get boring after a while. but, allmost all racing games do."
3,Multiplayer racing fun,"Wipeout 64 might not hold up to other series in the title when directly compared, but for the N64 there aren't too many racing games like it. Episode 1 pod racing has controls similar to this, but only 2 player multiplayer. Wipeout 64 has 4 player multiplayer. Crucial for being social! A very nice surprise in this game."
5,ideal!,"Bought this glove for my 5 year old, he loves it and will not part with it. Perfect fit for his hand. I would recommend this glove if you want a good one."
1,Wrong gloves sent,"I ordered two of these gloves for my nephews, both of whom are right handed. The product description says ""for right handed throwers"" and the gloves pictured are gloves for right-handers. The company sent two lefty gloves, which are made for left-handed throwers. Apprently, stupidity is a problem with this company."
5,Nice Glove,"My son needed a bigger glove - he had a 9 inch one that was too small, but anything larger than 10.5 swallowed his hand! I looked around at stores, but it is hard to find a 10.5 glove to fit a lefty - I ordered this one hopeing it would work and he LOVES it!!!!"
1,Poor Pictures,Amazon has placed the same picture online for the Macgregor RHT tee ball glove and the Macgregor LHT tee ball glove. I have ordered both gloves trying to find the right one for my child and they keep sending me the one for a child catching with his/her right hand and throwing with his/her left hand. I need the opposite. One glove should be for a right handed child and one for a left handed child. They are not making this distinction. If they only sell the glove for a left handed child then they need to eliminate one of the pictures.
5,all metal landscape lights including stake,"All metal landscape light including stakes. Very bright and a good light, but the electrical clips suck, but they seem to be the same as other low voltage connectors."
4,I would give this 4 1/2 stars if possible!,"I read this book in one day, I simply loved the characters. There were parts of this book I felt so sorry for Miss Woodley I wanted to cry. The reason I gave this a 4 1/2 star instead of 5 is because I felt like the ending was rushed and wish it had been drawn out a few more pages."
5,Spiritual truths for everyday living,"This is a book that I keep by my bedside and refer to often. Each chapter is filled with primordial truths about how to live life on a daily basis. It is a book that is different each time I read it because I have changed since the last reading.Recognizing God will awaken in you a longing for spiritual growth and then give you some answers to that longing. The first chapter, Remember Me, spoke so directly to my life that I thought Winged Wolf must have been present with me all my life.If you are seeking your path, are on the path, or are wondering what the path is, this book is a must.Two Eagles"
5,forgotten classic,"When we were kids, we had a card game called Authors. I think the object was to be able to name the works of famous authors. At any rate, there were three titles that always seemed especially enticing: Idylls of the King, The Heart of Midlothian and Tales of the Alhambra.Thirty years later, I picked this one up with some trepidation; we've all struggled through classics of two hundred years ago, baffled by arcane language & outdated usages. However, to my very pleasant surprise, the book is terrific, combining an Iberian travelogue with delightful tales and legends of Moorish Spain. Irving's travels are interesting enough in themselves, but it is the tales, which have everything from flying carpets to hidden treasure, that really make the book.GRADE: A"
1,Should be a lemon law for this one,"Judging from the other reviews and from my own disappointing experience with this product, it seems like you either get a great light or a solar lemon. I purchased three of these lights two months ago, and not one of them has been as reliable or functional as I had hoped. The set-up process seems to be more tedious than it should be, and once I got them through the initialization procedure, they started failing one by one. The manufacturer was helpful and replaced two of the lights at his own expense, but the replacements promptly failed after only two days of normal functioning. One light morphed into a strobe light when triggered(then died altogether), and the other two work sporadically at best. I bought a similar product two years ago from a solar energy catalogue and it has worked perfectly from day one, so I expected the same quality from this light. If you need a good solar light, save your time and money and look elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your money,Good idea. Bad design and terrible reliability. First unit was recieved deffective. Returned unit to manufacturer who promised to reimburse me for postage. Replacement unit worked for a month and is now dead as a door nail. Manufacturer never reimbursed the postage as promised. Don't waste your money on this one!
1,Product did not work and also was poorly constructed,"I received the product and followed the instruction for charging. The company recommended that the solar light be left outside in natural day-light for at least two days in order to fully charge. After the two day period, the unit still did not work. Finally, after one week in natural day-light, the light still never worked. I am sure that the one shipped to me was most likely defective; (although, I never got a chance to see how it worked, I was also not happy with the quality in which it was made - thin plastic). Hope this helps."
1,No rating,"This item never really worked for me because my brother in law held on to it so long, then installed not knowing how to work it"
3,Reflections of a warrior,"i do not know quite what to say. . . at first I was skeptical. Was this guy for real? About half way through, I realized, It must be! Everyone, READ THIS BOOK! My brother was killed in Nam during the timeMiller was there, can't help wondering if their paths crossed. . . . . My friend can not get over her son being wounded in Nam but coming safely home . . . . . where is the concern for those who gave their lives with no recognition, I mean no recognition, but maybe the"
5,"A must-read, must-buy Vietnam memoir","This is an amazing book. It runs a little over two hundred pages, but is so engrossing that you'll probably blow through it in one sitting (like I did). The recounts of battle are vividly written and capture the terror and exhileration of combat better than any other book I've read. The non-combat stories, however, are just as engrossing and often laugh-out-loud funny. If you have any interest at all in war memoirs, buy this book now while you still can. This is one of the few books that demands more than one reading."
3,Overated,"I have read literally dozen's of book's on Vietnam and so the main reason,I bought this one,was the 5 star rating,given to it by so many.The book has few details and seem's to be written as a diary instead of a narrative of 6 year's spent in South Vietnam.This book is worth reading but does not deserve a 5 star ranking.While I appreciate what Sgt Maj Miller did for our country{Obviously}and am highly respectful of his MOH status[Again Obviously}this book in no way stack's up with the great book's written on that war.I would give this one 3 and a half and caution whoever is interested in buying it,that it is not a page turner and is a very simplistic account of what must have been an unbelievable 6 year's in SV.This book would be a good primer for a Jr High School Class."
1,Forgettable Book,I didn't like it. The characters are forgettable and the storyline was a disappointment. Not what I expected and definitely not scary.
5,"Racing fan or not, you're gonna love this!","Kent and Keith have written a wonderful book that treats the characters like real people and yet gives us a relistic look at NASCAR racing. And a rarity today, I can give my copy to my fourteen year old son and twelve year old daughter now that I'm finished! This has to be the way it was when NASCAR got started. And it has to be the way it is to be inside one of those cars if I ever had the chance. Some of the racing scenes took my breath away. Five stars!"
1,Not Barbara,"This is not Barbara Mandrell, all true fans know this isn't Barbara, so this is for someone thinking of buying this, DON'T it's someone else. Very poor quality."
3,"Reasonably good, needs more info and less photos","I'm gaming guide for bellaonline.com and when I saw the previews for Jet Force Gemini, I instantly went out and bought it. We grabbed a copy of this book after finishing the game to see if we missed anything. We hadn't, but the book did! Despite their overly-detailed microsecond-by-microsecond photos, there were mistakes and wrong information. It would have been better if they gave the instructions in a more logical manner, and cut out on the gloss. It's OK if you want reading material to look at pictures, but for real information you can do much better than this elsewhere."
1,BE CAREFUL!,"Be careful when you purchase these! Note they are not the normal size for a salt and pepper shaker - they are very tiny, and are not usable for cooking. It is deceiving, as they look just like the normal sized shakers. Don't make the mistake I did and be stuck with these tiny things if that is not what you are looking for!"
4,Moving though unpretentious,"This book is an account of Woodrow Wilson, concentating on his second wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson. I found it enjoyable to read and rather moving. Wilson was an interesting and odd person, and this book accurately shows that after his stroke in 1919 he was no longer the brilliant person he was before that calamity. Edith lived on till Dec. 28, 1961, which date was the 105th anniversary of Woodrow Wilson's birth. I found this book a satisfying and attention-holding book, tho it is does not pretend to be scholarly."
4,Worth a read,"Jeffrey Marks does a fairly good job writing about a woman who lived such a hard and bizarre life. Finding details for Craig Rice's life story must have been a real challenge. I am Craig's grand-daughter and I learned more about Craig's life from this book than from conversations with those who knew Craig. The book must have required exhaustive research on Mr. Mark's part. He ties the story of her life together and includes a great deal of information about Craig's novels, her movie scripts and her short stories."
2,who was that lady?,"this book is basically a series of short book reviews of everything (almost)that rice ever wrote. it is not at all a biography in the conventional sense and the author throws in a lot of anecdotal stuff, some of which seems fairly far fetched, without attributing the sources. the book is badly written and a depressing story of a totally dysfunctional person who lived her life in a totally dysfunctional environment. rice probably deserves much better than this."
3,For The Die Hard Mystery Fan and To The Author: Get a Proofreader!,"Who Was That Lady?You may not care that much after reading this!I enjoyed this book, because I like stories about people's lives, especially if they're a bit dysfunctional.Be aware though, you'll probably enjoy it more if you're a true fan of mystery novels. The book details mystery writing, authors and plots perhaps ad nauseum to the uninitiated. I did find it interesting how much personal psycho drama can get played out in these mysteries!Also, I never read a book with so many errors! Did anyone ever proof read this?! That's the mystery to me!"
2,Needs an Editor,"This book contains interesting information about a fascinating woman mystery writer, but it desperately needs an editor. The sentence structure is often deplorable and frequently defies analysis. I have a co-worker to whom I was going to suggest a review of English grammar who actually writes much better than Mr. Marks. I give it three stars for content and one star for writing mechanics."
4,A lost soul,"I love biographies, but I had never heard of Craig Rice. As I read this book I realized I had read some of her short stories but they had not made much of an impression. This was an interesting book involving a great deal of research & time due to the lack of material from Rice herself or her family & due to lies & innuendos from others. All in all, a sad life, a life of great potential, but little self control. A true lost soul."
3,A Valuable First Step,"It's nice to see the witty, vital work of Craig Rice finally getting some scholarly attention. Jeffrey Marks has done a thorough job of research, and he deserves praise for untangling such apparently Gordian knots as Rice's real name, the history of her marriages, and her confused publication history. However, his biography is more of a necessary first step than a truly engaging work in itself. While he details the sorrows of Rice's life, he never really shows us why her contemporaries referred to her as funny, bright, and lively. His analysis of her place in the history of her genre is cursory at best (surprisingly, given his knowledge of the field), and he tends to summarize rather than discuss her novels. The book is also quite badly proofread. Nonetheless, he has performed a true service for Rice fans and critics, who I hope will use this book in order to do more analytical work."
3,"Zoom, Zoom, Zoom!","I, too, am a yoga beginner and found this tape difficult to complete. While exercises were not as challenging as I imagined (but then again, perhaps I was not doing them right?), I found the pace of the video to be way too fast. From the moment the video started, I felt as if I was ""zooming"" through, and I do not think that the yoga workout was meant to be like that. The narration is useful if you are already familiar with the poses. I also found myself wondering about my form, a more detailed explanation would have been helpful. On the positive note: No Fluff, No Sugary Slogans, No Colorful Backgrounds, Just Yoga. I think I will be returning to this tape after taking at least a month of teacher-led classes."
4,Good Intermediate Yoga Video,I have been taking yoga classes for a year and want to move into more difficult poses. This is somewhat difficult for me now but I feel it is a good video to learn and expand past the beginners level.
3,Good workout / no breaks!,"I've tried so many exercise tapes, including yoga tapes, over the years and this is actually one of the better, less-obnoxious ones. It's a fairly tough workout but is very well-explained throughout, has no goofy music, narration or ugly sets getting in the way. The biggest problem with this - and it was a big one for me - is that the tape goes logically from a less to more strenuous workout but, at 70 minutes total, there is no clear way to break the workout up. Other tapes will maybe put 3 20-minute workouts on one, so that you can do one, two or all three workouts and customize it for yourself. Not the case with this one, and that's a pain. What it means is, if you don't have over an hour to workout, you will have to just stop the tape, interrupting any sort of flow and progression. Frustrating!"
4,"Excellent instruction, but not advanced...","As a yoga teacher I found this tape very complete, with emphasis on breathwork, alignment and postures which worked the entire body and ending with a relaxation. Not too much useless chatter with good examples of modifications for both beginners and more advanced. I love doing my sun salutations with Tracey Rich in the morning, but I wouldn't call this an advanced tape. The holdings are not very long, nor are the postures particulary difficult. I believe any beginner could benefit from this tape and raise their level of proficiency, but advanced students would be bored. Should be part of a serious student's library because of it's completeness and yogic tone, but add some Rodney Yee and Bryan Kest for more stamina work."
5,The Best Yoga Video,"After ten years and twenty pounds I have returned to yoga. Because classes can be expensive, yoga videos are the best way to keep motivated between classes. I tried half a dozen and this one is by far the best. The other videos either bored or hurt me. This one is not a beginning video, but if you have a sound body you will quickly get the hang of it. Total Yoga is 97% Tracey Rich who has a pleasant voice and perfect appearance. She demonstrates this flowing form of yoga at a steady pace; which isn't easy to follow at first. Do watch the video before doing the practice. After a week, I can almost do the entire video in one sitting. Next, I plan on perfecting the postures. Probably the most important attribute of this video is that it is a flowing form of yoga that leaves you feeling physically balanced. As with any practice; you will eventually need to find a good teacher that can help you to master the postures."
3,"Not ""for everyone"" as they say on the box","This tape is not for beginners - many of the moves were too hard for me and my partner. Also, each pose was demonstrated rather quickly, much more quickly than I have ever seen in an in-person class. I fealt like I was doing calisthenics. A pause button on a remote control could fix this issue. Even with these concerns, this tape is very professionally filmed, well presented, shows each move from several angles, and probably would be great for those with more expereince with yoga."
4,Not for beginners...,"The back of the tape's box describes it as ""accessible for beginners"" and ""yoga for everyone"". This is NOT a tape for beginners. (I wish I'd read these reviews before I bought the tape.) It does seem pleasant and challenging for more advanced students."
3,Good but . . .,"This is a thorough yoga session that takes you through all the paces. However, at the end I still feel like I didn't get all I wanted to out of it. Maybe that's because it's hatha and I'm more astanga . . . But it is a good change of pace!"
2,Not for beginners,"This tape claims it is ""accessible for beginers"" but I found this not to be the case; unless all yoga beginners aside from myself are already very fit and flexible. The tape starts really well with a great introduction to breathing ""properly"" but then moves into a series of salutes that were hard to keep up with as a beginner. The postures later in the tape were easlier to keep up with.Although I am fairly fit and stretch regularly, but I found the tape was paced for people who are much more familiar with yoga and the movements than I am. I found I had little idea whether I was holding poses correctly or not - there could have been more pointers in the tape about problems people often encounter in holding certain poses. All in all, the tape was not encouraging. It left me with impression that I need to significantly increase my range of movement by other means before I can enjoy yoga - which seems ridiculous to me."
2,BIG NO IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER,"i used this video as my first exposure to yoga and found myself incredibly discouraged. they dont explain any of the positions, and used language that i didnt understand. i can imagine that it may be nice for those who are experienced, as it is very simplistic in terms of instruction, but if you, like myself, are looking for a introduction to yoga, i recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Not So Authentic,"I thought this book would reveal how John himself played these songs. Especially I hoped to learn the authentic intros to songs like Country Roads or Poems, Prayers & Promises. What you get is an easy guitar book that anyone can play. The arrangements are mostly just picking standard chords. It's not much more than most players could figure out from words and chords without tabs. Annie's Song has the most authentic arrangement. This book is worthwhile if you are beginning to learn guitar and to read tabs. However, I can hardly call it ""authentic"" if you want to learn John Denver's style."
5,A Delightful Look at the Lord's Prayer,"I have always loved the meaningful prose in King James Version of the Lord's Prayer. I felt really inspired after I read Pastor Pritchard's delightful commentary on a prayer that has been repeated as much as any other piece of English literature.What makes this book great is is Pastor Pritchard's down-home style. And When You Pray is not a deep, theological treatise. It is a delightful exposition, filled with relevant anecdotes and personal illustrations.I would recommend this book to help jumpstart your prayer life and also as an encouragment in tough times. It is an easy read. Pick it up and put it on your nightstand."
2,"Caterpillar Men's 2nd Shift 6"" Plain Soft Toe Boot,Honey","I expected this boot will be a comfortable one, but it not!. I bought another flexi boot from Caterbillar before two years ago. The past one was very comfortable, unlike this model."
2,Get what u pay for,"Boot is more of an orange color than tan. Insole is hard and uncomfortable. Will not be wearing these. If ur looking for a cheap boot, this is it."
2,not very comfortable,"my old work boot was the timberland pro's, which lasted about 2 years before the sole started separating. I've worn this about 2 weeks, and my feet still hurts, too narrow. If I tighten the bottom of the tongue, I wouldn't be able to walk in it. also that pull tab sticks out way too much, I constantly have to pull my pants over it. Not enough padding, and as one of the reviewer suggested, get a sole insert. there's a logo sewed onto the inside of the boot and it irritates the hell out of me, even in wool socks, it tickles the bottom of your fee."
1,Hard as a rock,"My husband got these boots 6 months ago and refused to wear them due to them being so hard. He wore them on the weekends to break them in but that didn't work. These boots are literally harming his feet. He has been wearing them about 2 months now and we are looking for another pair of boots. He is hurting every night when he come home and you can see where they are harming his feet,he says they won't bend at all. Breaking them in isn't the answer, he has tried everything. If the seller could have stated if these boots had any give to them would have been helpful. Really wish they had been like the old ones."
3,Sizing,The boots were delivered as expected and the quality is great. Only problem is the sizing. I have worn a 10EW for years and have to order most of my shoes on line because of the width. These are actually sized a bit larger and had to be exchanged.
5,Exceptional!,"I have looked for a long time this item before purchase it. The reason: I was afraid about the size and confort of use during all the day. Finally, I have decided buy it. When I have received, the surprise: Fits perfectly on feet, spite the tightness of first use. After two days it was perfectly adjusted and proven the name Caterpillar on this. Rugged, light-weight, absolutely no-slip in all situation over the soil and weeds wet (I'm agronomist) and too much confortable all the day long. Recommended for all which wants a reliable and confortable boot for outdoor use in extreme situations."
5,Good work boot,"Great work boot. Sturdy, solid sole, steel toe, comes in wide sizes as well as regular. My husband is a machinist and is on his feet all day, and walks around on top of metal shavings and shards and risks large machinery landing on his feet. In that kind of severe working environment, the boots only last a couple of years, but for the price it's about as good as you can get without spending several more hundred dollars. They are comfortable enough, especially since he has wide feet and it is hard to find shoes in wide sizes, and he is on his feet all day. Great protection with the steel toe, as well. Overall, definitely a worthwhile purchase for hard-working men! :)"
5,Caterpillar Shoes,"These shoes are my favorite pair of shoes. I highly recommend these to anyone who's searching for a awesome looking, comfortable, durable shoes."
2,boots are stiff feeling and felt cramped in space,"I loved the breaker boots, so i got these. they were very different in quality and comfort. these boots are stiff feeling and felt cramped in space. If you are thinking of getting it, maybe try a bit bigger size and it might be more comfortable."
2,not as good as timberlands,I ordered these for the price and the good review. Usually I get timberland pitboss boots but saw the price and gave them a try.....after a month I got rid of them and ordered timberlands....I can feel every piece of gravel that I walk across in my foot and it really pays a toll on your feet....try to avoid them
4,Good solid boot for a good price,"There are better boots out there, but this one is a good solid boot at a fair price. I'd buy more of them when these wear out."
4,Solidly happy,"A good solid boot, used every day at work out and about on my feet, and so very comfortable. A good replacement for an old boot that I wore into the ground."
1,The quality is poor.,The poor quality made me disappointed&#12290;The shoelace holes card a lot of shred. And the car lines are also mess.
3,Heel split,"Been buying these boots for years and unfortunately, this pair had a defective heel on the right boot. Will exchange."
5,Great for the price.,"I recently bought a second set of these to replace my first. I work in the dairy business and I'm on my feet all throughout the day in every weather condition imaginable. With that being said these boots hold up great. When a pair of boots is only going to last a year tops I see no reason to pick up a pair that retails for twice as much. These boots are comfortable but I also have somewhat narrow feet. I hear alot of guys prefer other brands if you wear a wide. Within 2 days these are broken in and feel just as comfortable as my original pair. So, without a doubt, I rate these a 5 out of 5 at there price point. Theyre cheap, they last just as long as any premium brand, and they're comfortable for my feet. My next set will probably be the same pair when these ones wear out."
3,Needs more padding,The quality of the boots is high and the boots look great. The only problem with them is that the padding on the collar is really hard and not enough padding on the tongue. Otherwise the boots are good.
3,CAT BOOTS,"THEY WERE NICE LOOKING BOOTS BUT MY HUSBAND WEARS AN 11.5 AND HE HAS A NARROW FOOT BUT THESE WERE TOO SHORT IN LENGTH FOR HIM SO APPARENTLY THEY RUN SMALL. I HAD TO SEND THEM BACK. I FOUND THAT HE COULD WEAR THE 11.5 IN A LOGGERS BOOT JUST FINE JUST CATERPILLARS RUN ON THE SMALL SIDE,SO IF YOU WANT THEM TO FIT THEN YOU SHOULD ORDER A SIZE BIGGER."
2,not for cold weather,"This shoes have great leather quality but they do not have any lining at all. It's impossible to wear these shoes in the mountains, in the snow or just in the freezing weather. I wish I knew this before I bought them."
5,Simple loving it .....,"Its a best Boot for the buck you pay through Amazon.Its sturdy,tough, looks awesome and he hue and the haaa.The boots takes some time to break even though but its worth the effort though."
3,Good boots but,Even though I down sized still little large. Next time will go for brand with some more narrow widths. Price is right.
4,A classical critique of sociobiology,"In this book, Marshall Sahlins de-constructs the interpretation of human societies done by certain of the most eminents sociobiologists. He shows that certain elements of human nature and civilisation are not reductible to biological principles. He thus stresses the importance of anthropology as a science that contributes to understand the variety and unity of human cultures."
3,Good police story,Looking at Ironside in the 80s and now - 2 different things altogether. The tech and special effects today makes the movie wanting but nevertheless ... who does not love Ironside huh? Raymond Burr does a wonderful job
2,Great prints but Horribly time-compressed!,"Great series, landmark pilot film, terrific 35mm prints. BUT BUT BUT why in the world did they use time-compressed prints of the weekly episodes (the pilot feature is not time-compressed). Each episode was originally 51 minutes long and they have been time-compressed to play in 47 minutes. Consequently, all the voices are very high and the music has been pitched upward. Obviously there is no hope for this set. But I hope Shout Factory realizes their error and uses 24fps transfers for the second season shows.What a crime. Where's Ironside when we REALLY need him!!"
2,Lacks Subtitles and Closed Captioning,"Just a warning: While the video is OK, I can give only two stars to this set because I am hearing impaired and need subtitles or closed captions, neither of which are available on these discs. I feel they are considerably over-priced without these features. If you can hear fine, you probably will enjoy this set.(This is true of the season 2 set as well.)"
4,Great DVD Transfers But....,Well i gave it 4 stars because.Every episode is not crystal clear.There are quite a few episodes on here that are blurry.See for yourself.Other than that I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
2,"A disappointing effort, especially at the price.","I too was very disappointed by this book, and agree with just about everything stated in the other review. The lack of maps is inexplicable. There is very little discussion of the personalities involved, especially of the unit commanders. There are no anecdotes that would lend flavor to the story. The northern section of the battle is dealt with in the most summary fashion. Finally, at what I consider a very high price, I was very disappointed to receive a book of only 200 pages (which includes the bibliography, notes, index and other non-textual pages). This book has made me very skeptical of shopping by mail."
5,Perfect,This will add to my healing of horses. I use homeopathy so its is wonderful to have this as a reference.
5,The Best Game Ever!!!!!!!!!!,I went to my grandma's house one day and my older cousin had this game called Broken Sword and my sister had trouble playing it so I gave it a whirl.I found it to be the best game I ever played!I just fell in love with Goerge Stobart and how hard and crisp the art was.And its such a fun game!I didn't get that far before we left and I begged my mom to buy it for me but it was to old we couldn't find it anywhere.Thank God I found it here!Were definetley going to buy it soon!All I have to say is I hope you enjoy it and please buy it! It's not to hard and it's not to easy.You'll definetley think it's fun . Trust me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Difficult and British,"This game's biggest problem is the pointer is very slow moving around the screen, so i have to dock it a whole star just for that.Now graphically this game is cool, sound is surprisingly doity and light. The challenges range in dificulty but it is very addictive once you have a decent tv to display it on. A sleeper hit for THQ, which is know for Smackdown, not Britishesque style hidden object- based puzzle games. Patience is a virtue and you will need it to beat this game. If you think your clever then play this game, possibly too difficult for most American based audiences that are used to Mario jumping around type games. Probably common to Big Fish gamers, hidden object style of thinking."
3,realistic,Wave race was the first game that I ever got. It has an amasing level of realisum. Like most racing games you are adicted to it at first but the glory wares off. With Wave race though though you will always have a special place for it. The two player mode is the best way to play.
3,It's over?,"Wave Race 64. One of Nintendo's first game. Updated from v1.1. Wow. Amazing. This game is fun. OK! Game over!Wave Race 64 is a great game. You get 8 courses, 4 players, create your custom jet ski, go into a championship, play againts your best friend.... and it's over. Wave Race is nothing special. I can't kill it too hard because it was one of the first games, but it's just too short. You can only have 2 players max. Only 1 player Championship which is 4 EASY tracks. The custom made boards arn't really custom, you just choose between 3 factors, and you can do 3 tricks! (Which, during racing, give you no bonus except if you don't complete the trick, making you fall in the water and get behind) This game get's old within 1 hour. It is not worth the price, I can guarrantee you."
4,good game,Came quick and pins and cartridge were in excellent shape. Brought me back to the good old n64 era of gaming
3,Not so good for youngsters,"I bought this for my 5 year old (who usually plays older games) but he played it a few times then got bored with it. He regularly rotates through his other games, so this is an exception. This might be a challenge for somebody older, but I wouldn't recommend it for a younger kid."
2,Rent before buying,"In my opinion Wave Race64 was not a very fun game.The objective is to race a jet ski in an arena and place between 1-3 to continue to the next round.In the game there is a time race,a stunt mode,championship mode,and warm up.Yes it sounds like an alright game but you can be the judge about that.I gave it 2 stars because of good graphics."
1,Waverace is not fun,"I have played and watched this game for over a year and it has always been dull and boring. It is the worst race game I have ever played. It is only 2 players and their is no action. The only reason I would buy this game would be to look at the graphics, but otherwise, it's bad."
1,Where is it???,"I've emailed the seller twice now - still no response. The wrong order was delivered to me. The intended recipient's name and address is on the packing slip inside the package. I can understand a mix-up, but why not rectify the situation once it was brought to their attention. Still waiting for a response!"
5,Jet Ski Racer,"Excellent Game. The graphics are totally awesome and realism beyond comprehension. Diffently worth the $$$. Stunt mode is great which allows the user to perform free style jumps, flips, and tricks. A must have for your N64 collection."
3,"not bad, but not great","I rented Wave Race 64 in spring break '97. It was a game that I wanted to get when I first saw the previews of it in Gamepro. I was at my brother's house and we rented it for that week and it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. The graphics and control in it can't be much better, but it fails in every other aspect. The water was the most realistic I had ever seen in a game and the control was real tight and easy to control. But we got tired of playing it after a few rounds and it was too easy to win against the computers. The announcer was also about the worst I had ever heard in a video game. He just says ""Cool"" and ""Ok"" over and over again. The replay value is mediocre. The 3 different modes of play will keep it up there, but WaveRace 64 just gets old quick and it's too easy.If you like racing games such as Jet Moto and other water racing games, you might like WaveRace, but myself, I just wasn't crazy about it."
4,A great game for anyone who enjoys racing!,"Almost everything about this game is perfect. My favorite part in the game is the warm up mode, where tou can jump ramps and perfom a ton of cool tricks, like handstands, barrel rolls, and backwards flips. The championship circuit is also fun. During this mode, you compete against other racers, earning points to go on to the next round. The only minor problem is the lack of variety on each course. All the tracks look pretty much the same. Still, this game is worth buying, and is definitely a step ahead of racing games like Crusin' USA."
5,Very Pleased,"The rating process is an easy a choice to make as the entire purchasing process. Product was easy to find, review and purchase. The delivery was made as projected and everyone was completely satified. Quality product and purchasing process all around. Definitely a shining recommendation for all interested in the concept of ""money well spent!"""
5,My Samoan Chief,"The book is a classic work on the people of Samoa (formerly Western Samoa). I read it years ago, but wanted to return to it after many years.I did and the book is as I remembered it - an informative, well written and interesting work. Highly recommend it to readers interested n Pacific Island people."
4,Really a pillow case,"Don't let the name ""pack pillow"" mislead you. This product is actually a soft, washable pillow case that you stuff your clothing into. The resulting ""pillow"" is only as comfortable as the clothing you stuff into it, so your jeans may leave you tossing and turning all night, but your down vest will be pretty comfy. I use it as a case for an small inflatable camp pillow. Works well backpacking or motorcycle camping where space is extremely limited. Better than no pillow at all."
4,Daily Candy A to Z: An Insider's Guide to the Sweet Life,"I think this book is a must-have for all women! It is full of useful insight, funny anecdotes and real-life know-how..."
1,Not a book for children.,"I was reading this book with my five year old and nine year old before bed and was shocked to find that there is a picture in black and white of women with bare chests dancing before a crowd. The book also contains 3 swear words and is very violent. We read a lot of books in our family and enjoy all types of literature, but this should not be listed as a child's book. The story has some sweet moments, but I would not recommend it."
2,MF-36 DIGITAL BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR,"IT WAS VERY TOUCHY. WITH NEW BATTERIES, IT GAVE A LOT OF ERROR MESSAGES. BUT AFTER A FEW TRIES, I GOT A READING."
1,Horrible,"This product almost had me going to the ER. I felt a little flush so I used this monitor to check my blood pressure. It was 151/98. A second check showed 148/100. I then really started feeling flush as a wave of burning flushed my body. My wife an RN said calm down, breath deeply. I went over to my Rottweiler and started hugging and petting her. After about 10 min. I felt the flushness go away but the blood pressure showed 162/99. I made a Dr's appointment and brought the machine with me. In his office where my pressure always is elevated when he 1st takes it, I used the machine in front of him and my pressure was 153/107. I really got nervous. He took it with his machine and it was 140/82. You won't believe the relief. He took it again with another machine and it had come down to 135/80. I'd like to return the machine for a non-digital one. I've seen this before with a digital machine from a different company."
2,Mark of Fitness MF-36,"Results were never consistent. Many ""err"" readings. I was definitely no satisfied."
4,very useful,easy to use... we received it intact and in good condition.. good quality product but no extra battery on the pack!
1,didnt like it,"Didnt like it, hard to understand how to use it and it didnt give me a single reading at all. So I returned it and paid few extra bucks to get an automatic blood pressure monitor from the same brand and is working fine."
5,Joe Heaney is the real deal,"If you're looking to understand what Irish traditional music is about, forget Riverdance, Joe is the real deal."
3,An OK book to read,"While I found the information in the very book helpful, the CD was terrible!! If you do not have access to a piano and/or pianist for the vocalises, I suggest you find a more user-friendly book with progressive vocalises on the CD(s) and where you will only need a CD player to do them. Overall the book is OK with lots of technical information (stuff that a vocalist needs to know) but I must admit that the CD did absolutely nothing for me!!"
4,Great technical explanation,"Very usefull book in general. 5 out of 5 for the very detailed explanation of the mechanical aspects of singing.I found the CD very useful with two comments: The warm up exercises are too long. All voices are female, I wish there was a male voice as well.One week point is that the CD does not have some of the examples songs and none of the practise songs. Only chart for piano is provided. I also found the chapter on Enhacing Tone Quality too short.Very good book with good information. Definitely recommend."
2,Why is a man singing the High Voice for Vocal Exercises?,"Ok, I have just started with a Vocal Coach and need more practice. After reading the reviews, I ordered this book. Well, to my surprise the High Vocal Exercises are being sung by a man. And believe me he can't get anywhere near a high C or D. It seems as if some of the Low Vocal Exercises being sung by a woman should really be the High Vocal Exercises. To boot, the CD is scratched! I would also say that the exercises are too quick - not enough stretch."
5,A Berklee College of Music Resource,"I am a classical singer and have been an Associate Professor at Berklee College of Music for 12 years and I have been extremely impressed with this book. Even though the book is called ""The Contemporary Singer"", it is a valuable resource for any singer. It covers specific technical areas in a clear, direct manner but also includes wonderful guidelines for topics like practicing, vocal health and performance skills. In the CD that accompanies the book, a variety of warm-up exercises are covered which are very thorough and progresses naturally. I would recommend this book to the beginning student as well as someone who just needs to reinforce their vocal technique."
2,Not the best...,"The book contains some pretty good practical information, but sometimes it can seem a little bit useless (and boring). The CD is the part I was looking forward to most. It was said to have 87 tracks for high and low voices. However 21 of the tracks are just demonstrations! Also, it doesn't go high and low enough. My vocal range is an E3 - C#6 and I don't feel like this CD exercises my range well. The highest note any of the exercises hit is about a G5, the lowest being around an A3. Not a very big range, to tell the truth. I don't feel like I'm exercising my voice well enough. If you want good vocal warm ups and work outs that challenge you (range wise), I would look into Ariella Vaccarino's CD's. I have some of them and they're very good. I feel like the CD could have a lot of potential to increase flexibility and stamina, but they're just too short as they don't go very high or low, so I don't feel like I'm getting very much out of it. I'm pretty disappointed, to say the least."
2,This Book is Alright,...This book tells you everything you already know and uslessly embelished it. Gives you an annoying cd thats not fun or attractive to practice to...
2,crapped out literature,"hey if you want to read a well written book look somewhere else. I managed to finish this book because I kept in near my bed and it got me to sleep faster. Well not sure how this author got published but you can read the book for yourself if you want to fin d out. If you know what this book is about already then there's really no point in actually reading it. You certainly won't gain any insight into physics or science, the writing only skims the surface and does keeps it relativelly bland. Kindof of like a science fiction movie with computers that flash a bunch of images on computer screens for effects without actually attempting to penetrate the actual science of it all. I could go on and on, but that's what the book already did."
4,Non Fiction,"A group of students and researcher types are hanging out together and generally having a good time. They come up with a project, trying to beat casinos at roulette. After a long time spent on experiments and various methods, they manage to come up with one. It, of course involves various social techniques as well as the scientific ones to prevent them being booted out, as per usual. It is something that won't work today, though."
5,Make mine Black Cherry Almond,"This is an excellent, interesting little read that I gave to my uncle for his birthday. He is a hiker and mountain bike rider as well as a traveler so the story of Clif Bars is right up is alley. However, I am a non-outdoorsy, non-sporty non-traveler and I really found it enthralling. Once I had given it to my uncle, my brother needed a copy and several friends gave me the old ""Where did you get that book?"" routine. You'll enjoy the responsible and inspiring way the company was grown and developed as well as the travel and adventure aspects of the story. It is inspiring and entertaining for all kinds of readers so don't pass it up even if you aren't into Clif Bars ( how could anyone not like Black Cherry Almond?....Sorry, I digress)."
3,Nice Story from another Bar Manufacturer,"We are a new bar manufacturer starting out and I was interested in reading the story of clif bar, more for the amazing new food category that was spurred by the popularity of nutrition bars.There was a little about the business, but mostly reminesences of Mr. Ericksons travels.He seems to jump to grossing 100 million dollars a year as if it was nothing. As another protein bar manufacturer [...] I know he must have worked his buns off just to do a couple million. I think the amazing part of the story was the growth of the company in launching a new food category..the excitement of landing a big account, etc ..but unfortunately that part goes missing.The story was good, but it was not exactly what the title suggests and seems to repeat itself over and over again."
4,Fascinating True Stories,"Interesting and fun read. Many important life and business lessons tied together. As a cyclist, skiier, and small business founder and owner, I can relate to many of the adventures and lessons of life and business woven neatly together in this book."
2,Great book. Miserably laid out.,"This is a very inspiring book, not completely unlike ""Let My People go Surfing,"" although I liked that one a lot better.However, this book appears to use an unusual font with very small print. Lots of white space. Then there are wonderful anecdotes printed in a light gray that contrasts poorly with the paper it is on. Talk about eye strain.Maybe the Kindle version is better, but the paperback edition that I bought is simply awful.....That does not detract from the message, but you should try a different version. Four stars for the writing, maybe 4.5. Zero stars for the publisher."
2,an ok pool float,"I had this for less than one season before the seams came undone and the float tube pushed out of the hammock. When not in use I kept it out of the sun in a shed, so sun degradation should not be a factor. It was comfortable for me (I am 5'3"", 135 lbs) but taller, heavier people were not as comfortable. I no longer own this since the seams burst."
2,Kelsyus Water Deluxe Hammock,"I bought this Hammock for the pool for my kids for X'mas I didn't want any thing that inflated so this was a good solution. Portable, inflatable edge only and with a netting bed so it won't puncture easily .It twists in half to form 2 small circles that fold onto each other to close and pack into its carry bag ( like a windscreen sun protector ) which is a great idea but the trouble is when it is out flat in the water it bends in the middle every time you lye on it so it feels like it is collapsing. Can't seem to get the kink out of the twist/hinges on both sides of the rim where it folds in half. So I am still seeking the perfect pool lounge.I now only buy beany bag + netting model pool lounges , Blow up models all deflate too easily. I thought this Hammock looked like a good solution. Search The SLACK AMPHIBIAN CHAIR Australian product... very nice!!"
5,Still Floats,This pool hammock is rated up to 250 lbs. I weigh 260 and hammock still floats. The head pillow is comfortable and I really enjoy talking naps on this hammock.
5,Deluxe Water Hammock,"Best water rafts we have. Will be buying more next summer, as we've thrown away the old brands. These are comfortable, soft, easy to get on and off, easy to inflate. Love them."
1,Contra-Legacy Of Lame,"When I first got this game I thought it would be fun. Instead, it was one of the worst games I have ever played, and I have played a lot. The graphics make me think of Atari 2600 and the sound is like 1970s and the game play is awful. You only have 8 health bubbles that every time you get hit, one goes like they're expecting you to live through the whole thing. And the cheat codes mostly don't work. When you hit some guy they explode up in flames, and whenever you try to blow up a gun turret, it hits you about 3 times before you destroy it. The levels are so long and they don't even have any checkpoints. I expected Konami to do better than this, but what were they thinking!"
1,"obvert your eyes, i don't want you to see me cry",Every case that holds this game goes down in value.
4,Escaping life in a small lumber town,"A friend loaned this book to me by simply stating, ""I think you'll enjoy this."" Little did he know, but Ricochet River was like a walk down memory lane for me. Although I didn't live in the town where this adventure takes place, I did spend time in and around it doing similar things as the characters in the book - fishing, rafting, movies and other small-town high school fun.Wade befriends Jessie the Indian from Celilo and Jessie teaches him new ways to look at the world. Lorna, Wades girlfriend is smarter than everyone as she can see that they are in a nowhere town destined to go nowhere. Together, they each find their own way out.Robin Cody acurately depicts the flora and fauna of small milltown life on the western slope of Oregon's Cascade mountains. Cody's depiction is so acurate that I wonder if we met somewhere along the Ricochet River.Highly entertaining!!!"
5,Two thumbs up for Ricochet River,"Ricochet River reminds me of A River Runs Through It, another book I really love. Personally, I like river stories, having grown up on a river myself. The lessons the river can teach us--about death, life, beauty, and tragedy--are sensitively and often humorously evoked by Cody's book. Somehow he captured not only the spirit of his coming-of-age characters as they face prejudice and futility in a small town, but also the spirit and majesty of the Columbia River and its terrible beauty. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys quiet, powerful tales about small-town life, teens handling prejudice and facing maturity, Native Americans, the Pacific Northwest, or rivers. Please note that this would probably get a PG-13 rating; if you're offended by even mild sexual references or bad language, then you might not want to read it (but I really feel you'd be missing out on a great book)."
3,Ricochet River,"In review of the book, Ricochet River, written by Robin Cody, I have discovered many mixed feelings. The book is quite easy to read, and one would not get lost throughuout it's text, however, I personally, appreciate a challenging book that keeps me on my toes, Ricochet River failed to deliver that. None-the-less, it was still a decent book with a good message, it just took a while to get to it. Ricochet River is definitely teenager reading material, and due to it's language content, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone younger, and at the same time, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone much older due to it's slow reading and easy vocabulary. But to anyone who's interested, it's worth taking the chance!"
1,Gun With The Wind,"These guns do not work on flat screen, LCD, or plasma televisions. So, unless your TV is an older model, don't waste your money. I wish someone had mentioned that fact before I let my kid spend his allowance on it.No more Duck Hunt."
1,did anyone know these don't work on new stuff?,"did anyone know these don't work on new stuff? the vendor was fine and sent the product right away. it was in good condition. however, (and this is my fault for not knowing i guess) the zapper will only work on old crt tv's. it's just a technology who's time has past. no duck hunt for us (on the old nintendo that got dug out of the basement). it was a fun idea but, i guess we'll stick with the wii remote...just not the same."
5,hahah awesome,this thing is awesome now i can play duck hunt like when i was a kid. This thing came wrapped in plastic without a scratch on it thanks! A+
3,Not Exactly as Described,"Throughout the description of this item it claims that it has a 10 foot extension pole. There is no questionable wording-it includes a 10 foot extension pole. When I received my order from GETORGANIZED it plainly stated that it is only an 8 foot extension pole. I emailed them and they claimed that the wording in the description is misleading.The extension length was what made me buy this product online at Amazon and not a similar item from a local store. When I saw that it was only 8 feet I was disappointed. No others commented on this type of problem, I wonder if I was a special case."
2,Not as advertised - still,"The product is servicable, but I shared the same experience as H. Brizuela: I was delivered a product with an 8 foot pole rather the 10 foot pole clearly advertised, and received the same brush-off from Erica in customer service. They've been aware of this ""misinformation"" for 5 months and done nothing to correct it. Next time I'll take my business elsewhere.Update: after forwarding GetOrganized's brush-off response to Amazon Customer Service and posting this review, GetOrganized apologized, refunded my money, and promised to update the product listing."
2,Shipped me an 8ft pole,"Like some others, I too received an 8ft pole instead of the 10ft one I ordered. You'd think after the several criticisms on this front that they would have made an effort to see what's going wrong with their fulfillment dept. Further, the receipt and return label was stuck onto the carton with the UPS label, attempting to remove the UPS label ruined the return slip. I'm being a bit harsh and giving this review a 2 star because I really think this company ought to get their act together and ship out the correct parts. I'm not going to bother returning it as I only have one high window and will probably manage with my step stool for that if necessary. Other than that, I think it's quite a good set and will suit my needs just fine and it is reasonably priced."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this to change a very high lightbulb. While I can reach the bulb, the suction does not hold well enough to twist the bulb out, so it is quite frustrating. I am sure the other attachments will come in handy at some point."
2,Very very disappointing,"On first use the rubber came out immediately and didn't stay in the groove. Particularly difficult to deal with when you are on top of a ladder cleaning a high window. Which is really the purpose of this tool, then the rubber broke! So all in all very disappointing."
3,Sponge fell off,"I bought this item to clean the solar panels we had installed at the end of May. I wanted it because of the 10 foot length of the telescoping poles. Other reviews mentioned it not really being 10 feet. The one I got is that long. It came with a sponge/squeegee and two other attachments I wasn't really interested in. I used it once washing our truck which is pretty tall and was happy with the extension. This week I washed the solar panels. By the time I was through, the sponge head was half way out of the holder and totally useless. The squeegee works well and the pole length is what I need for these so I don't have to crawl around too much on the roof. I'll have to figure out something else for the sponge or get a replacement. I won't need it until next spring, but having that fall apart on the second use was a huge disappointment."
1,Pure junk,Don't waste your time getting this. It's pure junk! It won't last more than the first time you use it. The squeegee keeps popping out making you feel really bad you bought this.
3,Do not rely on pictures; attachments are not included,"I bought this item specifically for the fan attachment. When I received it, there were 3 attachments: a mop, duster and window cleaner. I guess it's my fault for not reading the product description more closely; however, I think the pictures were misleading. When I went online to try and order the fan attachment, it was sold out with a note saying ""we don't know when this item will be back in stock."" Total let down."
2,"random attachments, no package box, ship in oversize package","No exactly as described. Bulb changing attachment is missing. Pole is 10 ft. Shipment come out in a over sized box, but product has no original box. Not feel like branch new, but rather something returned or refurbished"
4,Simple & Easy,Easy to use right out of the box. Multiple attachments make cleaning a breeze. I literally cleaned my 20' high ceiling corners and molding throughout my living room. Breaks down easily for storage.
1,Cleaning kit.,"Don't waste your time. Sent it back. Also came with different attachments than what was stated. For the money, step up to better quality!"
3,Versatile,"I'm faily happy with this product because it's very versatile. The attachments tends to turn after a while and needs to be re-tightened. It has a long reach, which is great feature, but when fully extended, the handle feels kind of flimsy."
1,cheap,"Thought it would be much better than it ended up being. the attachments are cheap and feel like they will fall apart soon. Ended up buying a far superior type of kit from Costco with well made attachments, more attachments, and a swivel head on the pole. It only cost a few dollars more than this one, but works far better."
2,Fiesta,"I found the same error as one of your other reviewers. I have been wanting to get FIESTA 1947 starring Esther William and Ricardo Montalban, but the Fiesta on this video is not the one. It is a mexican story, has nothing to do with the FIESTA I would like to have. I have also noted on IMDB that they are showing the 1947 as the film which is on this Great Musical Classics. i will try to contact them as they are showing the one I want as available on Amazon.Ca and Amazon.com, available on DVD, but it is the Great Musical Classics they show. I am really disapointed in this."
1,Wrong information was given,I ordered this DVD because of the movie Fiesta which was the last movie on this DVD. But this is not the same Fiesta that was advertised with Richardo Montalban. He is not even in this movie. Wrong information was given on that movie. It is not the same Fiesta with the cast they have listed. This is like a mexican dance movie or something.
1,Poor picture quality.,The quality of the picture was poor. It looks as if was shot in 8 mm & then blown up to 35 mm .
5,PERFECT for flowers and fruit trees.,"We LOVE this product. It is PERFECT for bulbs, flowering bushes and fruit trees. We used it on our flowering trees too, and we would highly recommend this product. SHIPPING IS EXPENSIVE. The seller needs to do better on the shipping."
4,The heaviest Bass-Heavy Hip Hop you will ever hear,"This album blew one of my speaker cones out of its rim when it was on relatively quiet. I turned the volume up midway and there was structural damage done to the house. At two thirds, my roommate's internal organs began to rupture and we had to take him to the hospital.Seriously though, the bass lines on this album will resonate with you in ways you didn't think possible. Danny Break's use of synths and samplers (not to mention his scratching) are totally unique and many of these tracks will stick with you. It also works very well as an album -- sometimes rare for this type of music."
2,No Magic Bullet,"No matter what you spend on a any product promising younger looking skin, the only thing that REALLY works is a face lift. This product is no different."
2,Play Revenge instead,"I am not giving this a very fair reveiw, I didnt play the gamne much because I played Revenge before this one and this one just seemed much slower and no where near as good... if thats a crime, sue me.... but I recomend Revenge over this game for WCW.... but as for wrestling games, I recomend NO MERCY over everything."
4,Good old school fun,"I popped this in a few days ago, being home sick. I'd forgotten how much fun it is. Basically, it's the Great-grand-daddy to WWF: No Mercy. There aren't as many moves as the games that came after it, and the look isn't as crisp. The fun comes in using the wrestlers from the DOA and IU Leagues. Most of these guys are un-named rip-offs of Japanese stars like Hayabusa, the late Gary Albright, and The Great Sasuke.The biggest gripe I have with this game is the wrestlers chosen for a couple of the ""hidden wrestler""/title matches. You have to face Wrath for the DOA Cruiserweight title, and we all know Wrath was no cruiserweight. Same thing with DDP for the WCW cruiserweight belt/trophy. But if you want to trace the evolution of THQ's advancement of Video Game Wrestling, this is the one to start with."
3,WCW/nWo WORLD TOUR: IT COULD BE BETTER,"The first thing that sucks is the beginning video for the game, it's boring and has no piont.Second is the graphics and the fact that there is NO CREATE MODE. The last thing is that there are bunch of wrestlers I've never heard of.It may seem like I don't like the game at all, but IT COULD BE BETTER"
5,It was Revolutionary for Wrestling Games!,"Every great series has a beginning. Lets put aside Revenge and WM2K for a minute and talk about World Tour. Without this game there would be no Revenge or WM2K. This game set the standard! It introduced us to what we thought was merely impossable in video game adaptions to wrestling. The play control astonished us at how easy and how fun it made the whole game. Great selection of old time favorites. Great modes...tournament especially! Tons of fun with friends! Most people threw this game out when Revenge and WM2K appeared, but not I. I still hold this game close to my system. This game was truly revolutionary and i will never sell it! This is another game that should be dipped in gold and put up on a plaque, but not before you play the heck outta it!"
3,"very good quality, D5000 does not fit","this bag is very good, but unfortunately does not fit Nikon D5000 because of the built-in flash. I tried all the positions and the camera must be forced to fit the bag and the bag is deformed a bit.However, other SLRs like Pentax K100 or zoom point and shoot cameras will perfectly fit."
4,Quality Camera Bag,"Convenient bag for toting your DSLR around while traveling. Nicely cushioned to protect the camera while roomy enough to store an additional lens, memory cards, charger, and even my mini tripod.Highly recommended for someone who wants something more portable than a camera backpack and something with more storage than a molded camera case."
4,"great product,...but a bit small for me","I wanted a very compact bag, that would carry two lenses and the extraneous loose items...battery,memory,cords,filters,etc. I measured things out carefully and decided this was the best quality and smallest bag that would satisfy my needs. It did fulfill those needs. BUT !... If I had just thought about getting a case that would hold my camera body with the largest lens attached ( 55-300mm) I would have purchased the model 5564.( although, it is twice as much in price) Better to be a bit larger than needed than too tight. With this case I must store the longer lens until it's needed, but would rather be able to store the camera with ""any"" lens attached. Just for transport, and size,...this one is great. For functional working ease, a taller one should be considered. ( IMO)"
5,Perfect for my D3000,"bought this for my D3000 with the stock lens. the cam fit perfectly and the bag has a lot of extra space for another lens or other stuff. it feels pretty solid and that it would protect my camera incase i drop the bag. comfortable to carry, perfect for trips. oh, and the price is really good for what you'll get."
4,"Great, compact gear bag.","I bought this bag for my Olympus Evolt E500 dSLR with dual lenses. It fits the body and two lenses perfectly. I also managed to fit the new wide angle lens I bought as well. Other than that, though, there isn't much more room in the main compartment. The zippered pocket in front holds lens covers and additional memory cards. No room for the battery charger, but there would be room for an additional battery. Still, the price is right and it holds and protects my equipment."
2,The illustration is misleading...,"The illustration shows a camera, 2nd lens and a flash unit neatly stowed in the bag... I have a Nikon D80 with 17-135, Nikon 70-300 and Nikon SB600. There is no way to get those three items in this bag. Maybe a 35mm with short telephoto and compact flash but not a DSLR. Very disappointed with this purchase."
4,Emo City,"Spending many years of my career in Asia, my friends turn me on to many new culinary delights, exotic locales and in this case unique movies.Set in the Korea of the future Natural City is about a Special Operations type super-cop whose job is to work in a highly trained unit to hunt down cyber-terrorists and the like. This particular cop is in love with a android ""stripper/callgirl"" whose life span is about up. He breaks the law he has sworn to protect to find the bits and pieces required to keep his ""girlfriend"" from dying.The setting is very similar to Blade Runner with much more emotional drama that is common with Korean films. All in all I would give it 4 of 5 stars. It provides a similar view into what our future could be like 50 years down the road."
5,lovely,"beautiful movie with hot asian chicks,plenty of action.a must own for sci-fi fans.movie is so good that it will release a us version dvd in feb.28 2006."
4,Something Worth Leaving Behind,"The very first time I played this CD I listen to it at a very moderate volume and thought,""All the cuts sounded the same.""Subesequently after many listening sessions I totally retract my original statement.After her last spectacular release;I Hope You Dance;I felt it would be a impossible act to follow. Once again I was way off base.Some of the melodies sounded very fimilar at the beginning of some of the cuts,but they immediately flowed into new material.When You Gonna Run To Me and Surrender,were teriffic.When I heard;Should've Lied; it absolutely grabbed my sole, it was so powerful.This women is a genuine super star!Don't pass this new release up, it's a winner."
2,Not to Be Mistaken For Artistic Growth,"This album is certainly a change for Lee Ann Womack, but it's a shift away from where her talent lies. Her vocals are still beautiful, but ""Something Worth Leaving Behind"" is a dull pop-rock crossover exercise with leaden production and songs that are ill-suited to the artist's stylistic strengths. Lee Ann Womack seems to be doing everything she can, both musically and image-wise, to suppress everything that made her original and exciting when she first came on the scene. A waste of talent."
5,"AWESOME ALBUM, not afaird to stick to real country","I just picked up this cd today, and i think it's awesome. LeeAnn Womack has done it again. She may look like a pop star on the cover but her voice is pure country. I love it. One of my faviorte songs is track 5 ""Forever Everday"". I also love the title track from this cd, ""Something Worth Leaving Behind"". I think its a beautiful song, and a nice follow up to ""I Hope You Dance"" Way to go Lee Ann Womack!! By the way she's awesome in concert too!!!"
1,Not Country Music,"If you're looking for country music, try LeeAnn's self titled release or ""Something I Know"". These are both GREAT CD's. She has a perfect voice for country music - strong with just the right amount of east TX twang. This cd is for those Celine Dion fans who want to listen to adult contemporary music. LeeAnn has learned how to sell music to the masses, and left country music fans longing for a return to her earlier sound."
2,Where's The Return Line?,"Right off the bat: If you are a country music fan, this is not a country music CD.I first saw Lee Ann at fan fare week in Nashville, a bright, wonderful vocalist that took my breath away with her songs. That was country.There is not a single country music song on this CD. If Lee Ann was going to change her genre midcareer, she could have warned her fans. Her other releases were wonderful, country music, this is horrible as far as I'm concerned.Lee Ann has dyed her hair (a bad job at that) and changed her genre to a sort of blusie/jazz/pop type of thing and it doesn't work. Her talents are surely going to be wasted. The last track (13) is an international release of the title track that is PURELY pop, and intended to attract a new listening audience. I suggest she release this CD on the pop side, as it's a pitiful excuse for country music.If this is the mature path in life that she's going down, I will no longer be purchasing her cds."
1,Lee Ann and Faith have Jumped The Shark,"Talk about your sell outs. I don't like country singers that go pop. Go back to your country roots Lee Ann. I want something that's meaningful, like Patty Loveless's Mountain Soul. Not pop drivel like what you and Faith Hill having benn pumping out the last couple of years. Your last 2 releases don't come close to the quality of your first 2."
1,The title says it all,I have always loved this singer her music a few years ago was so traditional and having a more simple sound worked. I think she is the victim of bad management at the label and she is making music with the wrong people it seems and that is why this album has so many stale pop songs on it.
2,Something Worth Leaving Behind,What an appropriate title as that is exactly what I am doing. So sorry that such a great talent for traditional country has sold out to the Nashville establishment. It is very disappointing when the record producers just don't get it. Didn't they notice who dominated the CMA awards this year?You'll never hear Alan Jackson recording something as mediocre as this Lee Ann Womack attempt at copying Faith Hill.
4,Lee Ann Womack-Something Worth Leaving Behind,"On the first quick listen, I wasn't too impressed with this CD. Then after I had time to really listen, I quickly found several songs I truly like and now I listen to it frequently. I keep looking at the cover to make sure it really is a picture of HER! ...she looks so different.......anyway, I highly recommend it.....the music still has a country sound with variations of other music, which makes it unique in itself."
4,Good crossover album,"I think this album should have gotten more exposure. The songs are very solid and so is Lee Ann Womack's performance. A few songs aren't my cup of tea because the production and vocal performance is overly dramatic. But this doesn't take away from Lee Ann's talent. Some folks complain that the album ain't country enough, but all music forms need to evolve and diversify in order to stay relevant. I know there was a lot of pressure to create an I Hope You Dance Pt. 2, but I think there is something very classy about this album. Something Worth Leaving Behind at times feel ethereal. I would give it 4 and a half stars if I could."
4,"Not a country fan, but....","Ok. I see from some discussions that this particular material may be less ""country"" than material that Lee Ann has previously compiled. Because of that, some country purists fault her.My interpretation of all this is that this CD is not quite twangy enough. But, if country music is about relationships and day to day life, living, and loving, than this material is all country.I would not describe myself as a country fan, but I really like this CD. I picked it up one day on a whim, and on many of the songs, there was the distinct feeling that Lee Ann was singing to me, personally. There is a nice range of material, orchestration, and lyrical variety to make this CD easy to listen to, easy to enjoy. I am guessing that if you like the song ""I Hope You Dance"", you will enjoy eighty percent of Lee Ann's effort here. Lee Ann, keep it coming....."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I have all of Lee Ann's cds. The first three are great, but this one is awful. Its not a country cd at all. Almost all the songs are bad pop songs. Her voice is really good, so that makes the songs better than they could be, but it is still not worth having. Buy her other cds instead."
2,"It's ok, but not her best....","I listened to this album a few times already... The only song that I really liked is ""Something Worth Leaving Behind""... The rest just doesn't seem like Lee Ann's Style... I enjoy all of her other albums... Just this one is like she's trying to go to pop.. In my own opinion Lee Ann shines best in Country Music..."
3,I Need More Instructions,"Back in 1999, nearly a century ago now, I decided that I would do whatever Lee Ann Womack told me to do. In 2000, Lee Ann hoped that I would dance.I danced.Then came this CD.I think that Lee Ann was trying to tell me to leave something behind, but I wasn't sure exactly what I was supposed to leave behind. True love? Footprints? A used 3 Musketeers wrapper? What?!Tell me Lee Ann. Tell me what to leave behind! I await further instructions."
2,Disappointed as well.,"I too agree with several of the messages, disappointed in this CD. I was really looking forward to Lee Ann's new release especially after her last brilliant, amazing CD. I Hope You Dance was the best, the greatest, it still rings in my heart and spirit and I play it often and refer to it many times. Ashes by now was also a very moving and catchy song. In fact her whole CD last time was awesome and had real life and spirit like I believe Lee Ann has. The slow songs as well as the up beat songs were all full bodied and had a certain spirit that is hard to describe. This new CD lacks that spirit, that full bodied sound the true essence of Lee Ann Womack like she displayed in her other music. Personally I found it somewhat boring and usually I really like heaps of music. Sorry Lee Ann, I hope you can dance again on the next CD."
1,this album is the worst...,"the only great song on this album is ""something worth leaving behind"" the album is really all pop to me and not very good pop , she needs to go back to her roots and do country again?? do not waste your money on this cd!!!!"
3,"title may say it all -- disappointing after ""Hope You Dance""","Lee Ann Womack hit the top with singles and CD ""I Hope You Dance"". Already a Nashville sweetheart, her personal makeover was only supposed to help propel her to the stratosphere, where she hoped to join Faith and Shania. Ironically, she fails to crossover far enough to really please the rock lovers and the country people may well feel they've been left behind. Womack's nice solid, country-feel alto are frequently dominated or overshadowed by rock electric guitar licks on the likes of ""I Saw Your Light"", and ""I Need You"". While the title cut was a modest hit, our favorites are the more traditional ""He'll Be Back"" and ""When You Gonna Run To Me"", the latter with some very nice strings and background singer harmony. Otherwise, much of this album is forgettable pop filler that does little to delight. While many reviewers seem enchanted, we hope Lee Ann will get her directions sorted out before her next outing."
2,It was too serious,She is such a great singer but this album is one of those slick productions where it just lacks Lee Ann Womack and it just makes her into a different type of singer. I Hope You Dance changed everything for her before that she was alot more country and this is one of those albums where it is trying to be a remake of I Hope you Dance. It is a boring followup with less fun songs and I bursted out laughing by the end because I thought that's it. I kept pressing my cd skipper button and before I knew it I was at the end. She is such a great singer but she needs to go back to songs like The Fool.
2,Nothing Stands Out,"This album is very bland with no energy or pep whatsoever. All the songs just sound like filler to have a reason to release another title. ""Something Worth Leaving Behind"" and ""Forever Every Day"" are great songs, but the rest is not."
1,"Story is well-written, and there is plenty of mystery, but--","I'm afraid that I still found this novel to be more depressing than anything else. Even given the time period of the story, and the fact that at that time some women who were not fit to be nuns ended up in convents, I found all of the nuns in the story to be such liars and so plainly unfit to be nuns that I felt the convent shouldn't have been left standing at the end of the story. It didn't seem to me that there was even one woman within the story who really should have stayed in the convent. Perhaps Lady Elizabeth and Margherita came the closest - by the end of the story - to becoming ""real nuns."""
5,Slayers Evolution-R Season 5,Slayers is the one of the better anime series out there. From the 1st Season to 5th Season its a great anime. Lots of Magic and Sword fighting in this anime with lots of running gags from calling Lina Ms Flat Chest to Prince Phil being called a troll. Its a Must for any anime fan out there. There is 5 seasons and OVA/OAV Movie boxset to. I have been watching The Slayers Series from day one and I have really enjoyed the series
2,Wouldn't Burn Video Clips,"I downloaded the free trial version from their website, so I can't say, for sure, whether the commercial version would be different.That being said, I wanted to burn Simpsons video clips onto a VCD so I could watch them on my DVD player. I set it up, selected the clips and then.... I got error messages saying that the program failed to grab the bitmap for the file (?)I am running XP on an AMD eMachine."
1,Close but no Cigar,"This book is a good read, but not for the intended purpose. The book gives a realistic setting, ""How I went from nothing to something,"" and gives little useful advise. More sizzle than steak.If you want to know or get a surface idea of Lease Purchase's this book will let you know if you want to waste your time digging further into the subject."
5,the cool side of prague,"This book is fabulous. As a 'single' traveler, I especially enjoyed the section on restaurants to feel comfortable in alone! I used this book to find interesting sights, great restaurants (not the tourist traps), and the best nightlife in the city. I was also impressed with the explanation of the hotels.I arrived in prague without a hotel reservation, and I looked at several of the hotels on the list, looking for a room. I found Avant Guide to be right on the money regarding price, atmosphere, and room quality.I would recommend this book to anyone who prefers not to follow the stream of tourists from one trap to another. Bravo!!!"
4,Walking tours are great...,"Get this book if only for the walking tours. The tours are humorous and fun, the directions and anecdotal info are great. Totally unlike walking tours in other guide books, which I generally find full of facts lifted from dusty encyclopedias. Besides the tours, I found the restaurant recommends right on target. And then there are the graphics, which, although a little too hip at times, are a welcome change from other colorless guidebooks. My only criticism is not with the book, but the website which purports to update the book. I checked out the website before I visited Prague and it didn't say that the ex-pat cafe on the outskirts of town had shut down. I ended up making my way there hoping to meet other Americans only to find that it was closed -- and looked like it had been closed for a while."
5,A cool guidebook that's right on the money,"I buy guidebooks all the time and they always say the same visitors' bureau line. This one seems to change the paradigm of travel entirely. It's funny and fun, but is also full of exactly the kind of hotel, restaurant, and other info that is necessary for a great trip. I highly recommend it. Are there others in the series?"
4,Boots that make a Statement,These are certainly flashy boots. Those with thick calves will have a hard time closing the zipper all the way up. So far the zipper is holding up and the boots are attention drawers.
3,As Seen From a Lover's Perspective.,"An incredibly easy read that stands slightly above mediocre. The effort at painting the world around Van Gogh is satisfying with it's well-chosen colorful descriptives. Although the wonderments & thoughts are not lacking, it is missing a certain in-depth texture and that is probably due to a limited point of view. Or the author not fully extrapolating further and so you'll find some scenes too short to be considered satisfactory. The flow of the story is not terribly slow, it does transition when it needs be and complements the subtleness of the story. Altogether, this is an interesting concept that could very well have been possible during Van Gogh's last seventy days.*"
4,the last van gogh,I found this book very interesting and I learned a lot. It is a good read and I recommend this for all ages
3,Nice story.,"Kind of a nice story, but was kind of disappointed in the way it ended. Could have had a more dynamic ending."
2,Overly romantic drivel,"You may as well read a Nora Roberts novel - this is romantic drivel with slices of the life of Van Gogh stuck in it. Perhaps because the main (female) character is so weak that it becomes tedious and frustrating to read about her. From the author's notes about her research, it sounds like the character was based on assumptions from some facts determined during extensive overall research for the book. I complement the author on the depth of research, which she is known for. But the focus and extensiveness of heart-throbbing heavy breathing pining for her Van Gogh perhaps-if-you-believe-it lover... it diminishes the magnificence of the painter Van Gogh. Get real.If you want to read really good books about Van Gogh, there are many to choose from. Try one which includes letters to his brother and benefactor Theo, interspersed with paintings from the period in which he writes. THAT is worth reading, and gives you a true insight into the tortured and brilliant mind of Van Gogh."
5,Van Gogh comes alive,"The story of the doctor & his young daughter & son, who treated Van Goghwith herbs for the dark periods he went through. This story was so interestingit made me look up the doctor online and to look at Van Goghs paintings onlineso I could actually see the pictures talked about in this book. It brought theera alive for me."
5,Fascinating,"What an intriguing read. I'm a Van Gogh nut, so enjoyed this novel exploring the possibilities of what his time towards the end was like with this family. After finishing this, I was curious to compare it to the details in the astounding bio of Van Gogh released a few years ago (available on Amazon, WELL worth the cost if you like Van Gogh)."
4,Unos de los mejores libros de Stephen King,"Podria decir que es uno de los mejores libro de Stephen King por la manera en que desarrolla el trama y te hace sentir lo que siente los personajes, sientes en carne y hueso los sentimientso de los personajes, frustaciones, confuciones etc. Se trata de un escritor que tiene el sindrome de la hoja en blanco no puede escribir nada, su mente esta en blanco, y el escritor se debate entre su esposa muerta y su nueva novia llena de vida y asi se desarrola el trama."
3,Haag's Reader and Grammar,"Haag's Reader is a worthwhile book and copies are more readily available, but J William Frey's Simple Grammar of Pennsylvania Dutch is probably a better choice for the absolute beginner. Frey's presentation of grammar rules is easier to understand and he explains the pronunciation of the dialect much better and more accurately.However, Haag provides a larger vocabulary and better reading selections. The basic question is: Why do want to learn Pennsylvania German? If you want to speak the language, Frey is the better choice. If you want to read the literature, then Haag's reader is a better choice."
4,"Like the Lessons, Have Pronunciation Issues","Well folks, the Amish now living in my neighborhood have not specially encouragedme to learn the dialect, but I did get this book, Pennsylvania Reader and Grammar.Right away I was slightly dismayed to find that the pronunciation is not easy to follow: 'ee' in a word is really an 'ay' sound. And the native speakers in the area favor a broader, more 'southerm drawl' sound, to words. I have found help at Wikipedia and a couple of websites (Google 'Pennsylvania Dutch' or 'Pennsylvania German').Having said that, it appears to be a fine, recent grammar of Pennsylvania German. There are nice long reading lessons right away. Right away I realized, of course, that learning a dialect of GERMAN with three genders and 'only' three cases was just Hard Going. If you like languages, and you appreciate Amish culture, it could be GREAT for you."
4,Lots of information,"I thought this book would just be a translation dictionary, but it's also a ton of information and history. Good for when you're finding out about your family history!"
2,Dagesh Translator,"It's a good concept but I've had countless problems using this program. When I copy Hebrew text from email and paste into the Hebrew translate window all I get is question marks. The instructions under ""Help"" are very poor. And even though I have a bilingual keyboard I cannot use it with this program, instead the program has a pitiful software keyboard that does not allow correction of mistakes.With a few prompts I can get an English sentence translated into Hebrew.Overall you get better results free on the internet with mechanical translation. For example http://www.1-800-translate.com has a good mechanical translator that works without the problems of this program"
3,It's ok.,"Here's the synopsis. One-time cop turned mystery writer, Simone Gerard was making a splash in the book world with her series about a couple running a detective agency in 1960s New Orleans. Then nightmares about her supposedly fictional characters drove the sensitive author to the brink of insanity and forced her to announce the end of her writing career. But the mystery had only just begun. For her publishing company had recently been acquried by Mark Alvar, a powerful and charismatic entrepreneur with a strange stake in Simone's future.Captivated by her beauty, drawn to her vibrant warmth, Mark Alvar was shocked by Simone's inexplicable familiarity with the secrets of his past. For as her plots got closer and closer to real life tragic events that existed only in the shadowy recesses of his memory Mark became more and more convinced that this charming author knew much more than she should. The question was how? The answer could be found only in the terrifying obscurity of Night Vission."
2,quality questionable,I received these lemons only to find half of them dried out like citrus gets when it is past its time. I have to contact the seller to see if they will compensate me.Of the half that I got they were good.
5,Pain relief - Piezo-DX Plus Acupuncture Unit - AME,This is a very useful little gadget which will easily fit in your purse/manbag/pocket. It offers a simple solution to pain almost anywhere quickly and we would not be without one. Shipment was quick.
5,The punch of acupuncture withoutthe needles,"I love my Piezo-DX. It's small, fits easily in my pocket, and does the job. Worth every penny."
2,short lasting life span,this was purchased for a toy car and the batter does not last too long after being recharged. Will be looking for a different company to make a purchase next time
4,Rolling Thunder,"DH audio has an interesting audio series, Rolling Thunder, regarding stock car racing in the 1960's. This four-volume audio series (White Lightning, Road to Daytona, Race to Glory, On to Talladega, (all three-hour abridgements) narrated by Michael Skinner, brings the listener right into the pit. These audios have an historical background and well as the fictional one in these tales."
5,Welcome back to the '70s...,"This compilation is so ""Love Boat"" that I'm sure it's no coincidence that the cover art features a cruise ship.But more to the point, unlike some of Dim's previous releases, this one feels very relaxed, and even though it's not a continuous mix per se, the tracks groove together flawlessly. Whether you play it loud to shake your booty to, or soft during your next swank soiree, this music is meant to be played."
5,How fun!,Great old sounds and so nice someone took the time to put it together. I am always looking for more vintage dance and this was great!
2,Cartoons,"Exactly like the Sylvia Rayfield cartoons in her pharmacology books except larger. Okay if you can recall the picture in your mind or attach a ""memory hook"" to it."
3,Weak pin holding carabiner to watch.,I like this watch very much. I would give it a higher rating but I have lost two watches because the watch fell out of the carabiner while I was walking. I didn't notice that the watch had fallen and was not able to retrieve either one. Make a second loop to secure the watch in case of disaster.
3,mixed,"I love this watch. Numbers are large and readable, functions are great. However the clasp broke after 3 weeks of use, without any excessive stress or wear."
3,Good movie,"As I'm a big fan of Gerard Depardieu I have been buying some of his movies, I believe he is a very good actor and his movies are always something to see and think about it."
4,OZZIE AND HARRIET,"I brought the best of the adventures of ozzie and Harriet by stanley livingston, because l enjoyed watching this classic show,having purchased the ozzie and Harriet collection by Mills creek entertainment.The stanley livingston collection also contains two coloured epsiodes, that l really wanted to see. Though the quality isnt great, its still very watchable and entertaining. what i cant understand, and lm speaking for ozzie and harriet fans, is WHY THIS SHOW HAS BEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC WITH NO RESTORATION DONE ON EPSIODES AT ALL. ITS NOT FAIR, THIS WAS A MAJOR SUCCESSFUL TV SERIES IN TS TIME, AND HAS NOW BEEN TREATED POORLY. OTHER TV SERIES OF THE SAME TIME PERIOD,EG BEWITCHED AND HAZEL, ARE OF EXCELLENT QUALITY. HAVING SAID THAT IF YOU ARE AN OZZIE AND HARRIET FAN, ITS DIEFFERENTLY WORTH PURCHASING."
5,Warm and Wholesome entertainment.,"These episodes brought back many wonderful memories of my growing up in the 50's and 60's.I remember watching this show and getting that warm in my heart feeling. No drama, just believable episodes without vulgarity, violence or any of the negative stuff that seems to define todays definition of entertainment. To me, Ozzie and Harriet is the first reality show as the cast is made up of the real life Nelson family. It also portrays real or ""this could happen to you"" scenarios. Light and genuine humor flavor each episode and warm our hearts. Excellent medicine for ones well being."
3,"Don't look for ""little"" Ricky & David","If you loved ""The Adventures Of Ozzie & Harriet"" as much as I did, you might want to give this set a look--but don't expect much. The biggest disappointment is that most of the episodes are later ones when Ricky & David were grown up. I believe that the best shows were the early episodes when the boys were were children. With the entire ""Ozzie & Harriet"" library to choose from, why did they include at least one episode that is in the public domain and available on DVD at the dollar store? The commentary by David and Sam Nelson is poor and offers very little background. There are some glitches in the digital transfer to DVD. Generally speaking, the picture quality isn't much better than that found on the budget DVD's that are on the market. If you enjoy Rick's musical numbers, you'll get a lot more (with excellent picture quality) on a dvd titled ""Ricky Nelson Sings"" (also available at Amazon)."
2,very disappointing,"This DvD had the potential of giving Ozzie and Harriet Fans episodes that had not been released in previous collections,but instead opted out for the same old same old. I was very disappointed with both the episode content and quality of the digital remastering. If you are truly a fan of this sitcom the better choice for your money is the 100 episode collection by Millcreek Production, ""The Essential Ozzie and Harriet Collection"".With over 400 episodes out there I hope Millcreek will be able to put out a different 100 episode collection in the near furure."
2,"Not great ""extras""","Every episode of O&H is pretty much the same, so 24 is serious overkill. Only three have narration by David Nelson and it isn't very interesting. Not recommended."
2,The Color Episodes Looked Dreadful,"The color episodes that Harriet Nelson introduced during a retrospective on The Disney Channel in the late 1980's were very clear and vivid. Unfortunately, the two Shout Factory has included on this DVD set are blurry and faded, and the sound is weak. Hopefully future (season) sets will be remastered and uncut."
4,Good To Get You Started,"This is a good overview of the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet from it's first year to it's last. Some of the earlier episodes are of ok quality, but it is at least good to have them available.It is also great to see some of the Nelson home videos, and listen to some great audio commentaries from David Nelson and Ricky's son, Sam.Here's hoping that Shout Factory will release the full season sets!This is another testament in the great clean, comedy that was 50's television. If only tv today could take some pointers from yesteryear."
2,very disappointed,I thought this book would have more information about brokers and the whole operation of wall street worked through the eyes of brokers. However as i read this book i realized that is almost entirely philosophical. It was not at all what i was thinking it would be. I am disappointed and i just hope other people realize this.
3,An Occasionally Humorous But Dated Take on Human Nature,"In a supposed conversation between the writers Ernest Hemmingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, it is claimed that Fitzgerald said that the rich are better than the rest of us, to which Hemmingway replied, ""Yes, I know. They have more money."" For me, this is and perhaps will always be the most humorous statement regarding the fundamental truth about money, class and human nature.This was one of those leisurely reads on The Street that on occasion served the reader a laugh or two. Human nature remains the same then as well as now. Reading this book, I believe, will give you insight into the follies of today, which are on a grander and more pervasive scale than they were in the Roaring Twenties, because now with the internet, any fool can participate with his (often borrowed) money."
4,Amusing look at Wall Street from the inside,"The author first started working on Wall Street in 1927, and witnessed the considerable excitement over the next 5 years firsthand. He has many amusing anecdotes, some analysis, a great deal of philosophizing, and proof that the nature of the denizens of Lower Manhattan has changed little over 70 years. Hilarious if you buy, sell, follow, or even just talk about stocks. Of little or no interest if you store your money under your mattress, however."
3,Never Trust a Banker!,This books sums it up - Insider Trading remains the dark secret of Wall Street and has since day one.
4,An eclectic combination of musical experiences!,"""Dancing Child"" is a unique blend of soothing and stimulating instrumentals that are especialy enjoyable after a long day at work when frayed nerves are melodiously mended by the varied pieces that this talented composer, Ken LaBarbera, has created.The interesting combinations of keyboard and saxophone make for so many pleasing and delightful rhythms including classical and latin. It is difficult to say which piece I enjoy the most. I am anxiously awaiting Blue River Symphony's next album."
3,Needs an update,"I was disappointed in this book after having read so many glowing reviews. I was surprised to discover that it was written in 1944. The archaic language is a bit distracting, the hand-drawn illustrations look very dated, and there is too much use of words where clear diagrams would have been better. A picture is worth a thousand words, and you can double that amount of words if the prose is written in such an old style. I wasn't even able to understand what the writer was trying to say in a lot of cases. I don't recommend this book for beginners."
3,More magic books,"I feel the same way about all my magic books.Not particularly easy to read. All magic books are usually pretty obscure, for a reason: Magic doesn't really exist, and tricks are nothing more than obsuring the audiences perception. A good magician never learns from a book, they learn from another good magician. I don't know why I thought this would be different. It'll teach you concepts, but to truly pull these things off requires lots of practice."
3,Not for beginners!!!,"This is a great book on magic, but it is absolutely not for beginners. I can't do any of this stuff. My good friend is a magician and he loves it."
1,Misdirected,"I had read recommendations saying that these tricks were easy to do -- and perhaps they are, if you're a wonder at sleight of hand and enjoy lots of preparing and folding and concealing and slipping things into secret panels and misdirecting and spouting old-timey magic act patter.Most of the gimmicks are stagey and involve special props, so it's not just something you could do spontaneously. The steps are too involved and tedious for me. The font, verbiage and illustrations are very 1950s. ...Just checked the original copyright: 1944 -- and it looks like nothing's been updated since then. For example, the very first chapter is titled ""Effects with Billets and Pellets""... what and what?! Whatever it is, it involves a lot of paper-folding and switching. Just not what I thought at all -- I was hoping for really straightforward cool, easy tricks."
2,Wow this book was written in 1944,"Im pretty sure any good magician would put this book as a must have, it probably is a bible but ... Although most of the tricks are good not even the typeface used is new, is like reading a manuscript written in a typewriter, with a few, hand drawn illustrations. It makes it heavy to read after a while. Too dense for me, I prefer a more graphical, photograph intensive book."
1,Didnt like it,If your a fan of magic and perhaps a hobby magician then stay away from this book. It has little to do with magic and my opinion is that its no good at all. Another book I wish i didnt buy.
5,One of the two mentalism Bibles,"This, along with Corinda's ""13 Steps to Mentalism"" is an absolute essential for anybody that wants to get into the art of mindreading. It covers all of the main ruses, and Anneman's work with Billets is, in my opinion, unparalleled. Some effects are somewhat dated (i.e. some effects encorporate the ""magician's force"", which is now widly known by the layman), but considering it was first published in 1944 this is to be expected.Beautifully written and compiled, and very cheap for the amount that you have to work with.An absolute must."
5,Excellent,"The book is literally packed with excellent routines and techniques, most of which require little or no sleight of hand skills. Though somewhat dated (you may have a litlle trouble finding some of the materials used) it is chock-full of ""how'd he do that"" stuff. The variety of material contained is wonderful also. From billets to cards to envelopes to codes to blind-folds to money routines. Just get it! You won't be sorry. I hear that Mark Striving has modernized some of it with a book ""Annemann Updated"" or something to that effect. I would be interested in that but can't find it"
2,"Writing decent, story very weak","This book, turned me off so bad, I did not read any other books in the series.This author took such a stretch it was near unbelievable. The path the the Clan home world is the most closely guarded secret the clans have. The clans have seen some True Blood Clan Warriors turn into traitors for the Inner Sphere, yet they allow a disgraced soldier to return to the home world, with a female prisoner of war, and then return the the front. How convenient.With the recent release of MechCommander, I am tempted to read the latest book in this series, so that I might understand the game's back ground more thoroughly. However the memory of this book, makes spending money on the next book, a very hard pill to swallow."
5,Really good book,"I would like to begin by saying this is a great book, I must admit the plot was weak at some points, but that did not affect the story or point of it (thus leaving it with 5 stars) It shows how politics can affect a person who thought politics should be secondary to everything else, and I loved his principles. I think only Stackpole rivaled this one. (Grave covenant has been the best one, and barely at that, the others did not compare) Rock on Pardoe"
4,So far so good....,I have not yet finshed the book but so far it is very good.I as soon as i finsh it i will write a better review.
3,Honorless Stravag Freebirth,"This book was half decent for what it was (a quick tie in explination on how the inner sphere could find the clan home world the writer took some stretches in creating a caracter who would betray the clans. I my self think that the Smoke Jaguars are worthless genetic leftovers but they do have a sence of honor which puts them on mark above Jade Falcons, and that honor is what would cause a Smoke Jaguar in trents situation to possibly join the inner sphere or fight to the death in a circle of equals but never betray his clan to the extent of giving away the Jaguar home world and basicly the general area of the rest of the clans. Trent should be ground under the heel of the nearest Mad Cat or better yet just buried."
4,The kind of book worth reading.,"Although im generally partiall to box office writers such as clancy,Grisham and crichton.I must admit for a freelancer,Blaine lee did a good job,He keeps you entertained,interested,and basiclly hooked...As all good writers do.If your into battletech,this is a book worth reading."
5,"Very Elegantly written, Action Packed, I want more!","I loved this book. I have read many and when I started this one, I foreshadowed an exciting turn of events in the Battletech universe that is soon to happen. I was shocked at what Trent, a clan warrior, would go through for his honor, pride, his bondsman, and the entire Inner Sphere!"
3,Great Musical Biography....,"...of course not real Biography, contains some fictional scenes like to composing of the ""Vienna Tales..."".Miliza Korjus is just fantastic with a incredible singing voice. Luise Rainer acting also great.The Camera-Work / ball scene is amazing and inspired later a scene for ""Dallas"" in a episode where is playing in Vienna and J.R. and Bobby are dancing at the ball.Sadly this movie isn't released yet official by MGM or Warner Bros. on DVD. This Russian DVD contains english soundtrack but no subtitles. The Picture quality isn't the best but ok and watchable.Fazit: movie is great, DVD is just ok - could be done better"
2,Poor spanish translation,The translation to spanish is terrible!!!!! This book has a lot of mistakes that changes the main idea. not good
3,Tunes Incorrectly Named?,It seems to me that the first tract `Reavys; Jenny's Welcome To Charlie' Is titled incorrectly. I defiantly recognizes this first tract to be `Dowd's'. I am sure of this because I fiddle and play Dowd's Favorite and I am very sure of this error to the tune titles. Are there any other errors that can be noted?
3,Light-Up Phoenix action figure review,"The color & detail is pretty good. Like the Psylocke toy,this one is also stunning & hot with that perfect 10 body figure and long flowing red yet somehow clear hair. Also like the Psylocke toy,the light-up bit is a rip-off and barely works. It comes a card and some kind of device or something I don't know. Overall:despite the flawed light-up bit,it's still a fun toy to play with. I give this action figure a 6 out of 10."
5,Soap + is great!,This soap is awsome. I used to have an unpleasant chlorine smell on me after swimming. It used to take a day and two showers to remove the chlorine smell. Soap + removes the smell instantly! It an absolute must for swimmers!
5,Summerhouse changing my life,"I have almost finished building the summerhouse in Garden Retreats. It overlooks a bay where swan , ducks and other birds come over every day to watch my progress. This has been one of the most gratifying projects I have ever attempted. It has been time consuming, but worth it. I have even put in electric as suggested in the book. I highly recommend this book and this project. Once I got the summerhouse enclosed, I could trim out the interior and it was plenty warm inside the space. I can't wait until summer when I can sit inside the summerhouse and watch the sun go down."
1,Like voyeurism,"I had been waiting a long time to see this movie. I guess it never could live up to the anticipation.I felt horrible throughout the whole film. The acting and cinematography were lovely, I have no complaints there. But the story was hard to take, not to mention unbelievable.I didn't know enough about the history of Hungary to understand the political turmoil with as much information as is provided. There's really no explained reason for the headmaster to be so cruel. I can't really even figure out the conflict of the film - no big epiphany. I was disappointed.and I felt like a voyeur watching the lives of little boys (there are subtle sexual suggestions which I was very relieved didn't go anywhere)"
5,Awesome!,"I've given these sticks to adults as gifts and everyone just loves them! They are great for kids and teaching them letters and numbers on the wall, fridge, doors, anywhere! I can't say enough good things about these sticks :)"
2,"fun initially, but beware of dust it collects...","the wikki stix have a slightly sticky/waxy feel, and they're fun to play with and to make shapes out of. but if you want to make bigger structures, you're gonna need much more than this set.unfortunately, the stickiness makes this toy awful because unless you're able to use them in a completely sterile environment, with none of the sticks falling on the ground, your stix are gonna get covered with dust, hair, etc... basically, whatever debris is on the surface. over time, the stix become less sticky. and i don't care how clean you are, there's no way that you'll win the battle against dust and hair shed.since i can't wash off the dust particles and hair, these just became too gross to play with. also, they didn't adhere as well because of, well, extra particles stuck on the stix. they were fun initially, but i ended up throwing them away. i guess wikki stix would be fine if you thought of them as semi-disposable, but i prefer toys that will last."
4,good purchase for the money,"purchased for a grandson, a year later he still grabs this for those creative spurts and no-fussno-mess times...."
3,this movie was actually good for 5 dollars at walmart.....,"as the consumer that i am, i went through walmart and they had a movie bin filled with 5 dollar movies. this movie called ""durdy game"" popped up and it looked interesting (plus i remembered one of the chicks from BABY BOY)....so i bought it...it was kind of on the cheap side just because the way it was shot but the story line was actually not bad...basically it is about 3 independent women that have to make a living and get theirs. but they soon realize that getting theirs has its price to pay....the acting was not the best but you can kind of relate to the characters and they do make an effort to show a little depth....if you wanna watch something on budget and will satisfy your crave for movies get this....3.6 stars out of 5"
3,Not more than the original,"Not more than the original, still enjoyed the movie overall. The original DVD had more extras so I guess don't waste your taste purchasing this."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"This movie was alright but what disappointed me was the ending, Now they could have done better than that. The lessons are evident. Nobody knows anybody and people are like the weather, changing and unpredictable.This is the kind of movie you borrow and return . A 7 in my book."
5,Worth viewing as well as owning.,This was a pretty good movie for it to be a low budget film. The message in it was pretty self-explanatory. I dealt with everything from envy to very scadalous people that's in the game. It also let you know that you can't even trust your significant other 100%. Even the woman that the guy was in love with and married to played him.
2,Durdy Game,"The movie is ok. The acting was not that good. I wish I had not purchased it, but it's still good enough to have on the shelf. All through the movie my boyfriend kept saying ""Is this a porno?"" Basically, in the end, the movie shows you that what goes around comes around."
1,STRAIGHT WHACK!,"For anyone surfing these pages on Amazon to help them make a choice as to where to spend their hard earned paper....please take note. This film (should it even be caled that) is a been there, done that, wanna be bad and black flick that miscues all over the place. If the DVD menu is the best thing you can conclude from your purchase you are in deep deep trouble. Another indicator of the badmanship of this production is that it's being put out by the ""Man"" otherwise known as Xenon who have put out more bad black films than Bin Laden has suicide bombers and or Tanya York. Also, the best review comes from two cats who worked on the movie which is the same as Vanilla Ice saying he's the best white rapper of all time. Please, if you wanna spend wisely then stay away from this played out, copped out, flat out stinker where no talent is present anywhere in front of or behind the camera."
2,Good filtration but fan whined,"The first one I bought had two problems: the clock did not work and the fan had an annoying whine. I swapped it for another. The second one also whined, and, at higher speeds, the whine became intolerable. I gave up and returned it as well.On the plus side, it seemed to do a good job filtering the air."
3,"Price is right, but not that convenient","The price for the equipment is great, but the stethoscope cannot be utilized seperately from the sphygmomanometer, so that is somewhat inconvenient. Its not the best quality cuff, but the price is right if you are just using it to learn."
1,"Horrific ""translation"".","To anyone who enjoys classic Greek drama, I have one small bit of advice: avoid this book. I am generally open to translators taking some latitude and license with translations of classic texts, but in this instance that approach is stretched far beyond what is reasonable. David Slavitt engages in nothing short of raw butchery as he heaps the text with anachronistic references, slang and vulgarity. What could possibly make Slavitt think it is appropriate to include in ""The Persians"" a reference to a ""thousand-year reich""??? Xerxes as Hitler? No thanks! In an effort to ""modernize"" these stories, Slavitt succeeds only in destroying their dignity. The result is a ""translation"" that bears little resemblance to the original works. It's pretty tough to screw up badly enough to get a one-star rating from me, but Slavitt managed to do so. Simply awful."
2,A memoir or a 20-something angst-filled narrative?,"Ryan Knighton was born in 1983. It is perhaps an interesting commentary on his life that he feels ready to write ""A Memoir"" in his early twenties.If you're into descriptions of what teenagers do to take risks then this is a good narrative. If you're looking for a meaningful description of what it's like to lose your sight, I suspect that Ryan may be in a position to write that in about a decade. At this point, no pun intended, he can't see the forest for the trees."
3,"Some Good Material, But Not Perfect","I really wanted to like this book. Some of the descriptions of the narrator's increasingly challenging interactions with the world are wonderful. After reading it, I can well imagine what it feels like to be in a noisy club when you can barely see, or what it's like to navigate a stariway with only a cane for guidance. Even the relationship challenges are interesting and (to me) unprecedented.But sometimes there is just too much of a good thing. The in-depth narration gets tiring when it strays to non-pertinent events like teaching overseas. There are some good anecdotes, but they break up the stark reality of the growing handicap.Is it right to only give 3 stars to a book about blindness? Probably not. The author is great! I'll buy his next book for sure. But this one just didn't ""get"" me."
1,cupping set dissapointment,"Although the shipping was extremely expensive,I was very happy to receive my new cupping set. Within the first week of use, the majority of cups have major stress cracks,and ultimately,I will have have to purchase a new set.This is unacceptable,and I am sorry to have wasted so much $$$ on an inferior product."
1,Not the right scent,"I used Byblos for a long time. After the dept. stores stopped carrying the product, I could buy it at kiosks in the mall. When I could not find it there, I decided to check out the internet. I was happy to see Byblos on Amazon. There's one problem - it is not at all like the one that I had used. It is totally different! It is not a bad scent so I decided to keep it. Now I have to figure out where else I can look for the real thing. The service was good and I received my purchase in a timely manner."
3,Great switching capabilities for car...,It works great to switch between components in the car. We had it professionally installed but experienced a problem with it after 3 months of use. Now dealing with company to resolve issue...will post again if not satisfied with resolution.
4,A good book for girls!,"I am 12. I am really too old for this book, but it is good anyway. Good stories, wonderful Bible passages, questions, memory verses, and a key thought make this book great. While I am really too old for it, I happen to like it. Pick up this book today!"
5,Neat book of precious lessons,"I bought the boy & girl's versions of this book to give as gifts & read a few entries here & there to make sure it's appropriate. I was delighted to find that the entries are written in simple, interesting short-story format with biblically-sound lessons. Although the stories are geared towards children, some of the spiritual lessons seem just as precious & applicable to kids as it is to adults, I am humbled by it."
4,10-year old really likes it,"Bought this as a Christmas present. Ages on the book say 7-10 but I'd say it could be used for ages 11 and 12. Devotions seem to be age-appropriate and easy to read, but thought-provoking."
1,Yipes! Check out April 11!,"Not for my nine year old daughter thank you very much! This *was* intended for ages 6-10. However, the devotion on April 11 deals with an topic not intended for 6-10 year olds. I don't know what the publisher was thinking! I'll be reading the rest of this (and tearing out pages) before my daughter does another devotion in the book.Not recommended."
1,Narrow Minded Point of View,"This book is very preachey and not the way we intend to teach our young daughter about the all inclusive love of God. It is very narrow minded, and it's language is offensive from p.1. The idea of a daily devotion is a good one, but the content has made me pull this one from her shelf."
4,Delivered in good order,I received Volume I of Faith of the Early Fathers in very good condition. The cover and binding had a little wear but overall in good shape. The pages were also in good shape. This book is a great addition to my collection and a solid bargin for the price.
4,Good Starting Point,"The Jurgen's series is a good starting point for the lay Catholic apologist. It has many primary sources quoted. The only problem is that some quotes are not presented with context, though many are. All in all, this is a good reference book and is well indexed (if the quote you're looking for is not in its context, at least you now have an author and title to search deeper for more context)."
5,A very fun book to read,My daughter read this book for a oral school book report. She really liked it because she thought it was funny that Zack started to turn into a cat. After giving her report several others in her class also read the book and thought it was funny too.
3,Not up to Zacks usual level of excitment,What disappointed me was that it isn't as exciting as the other Zack Files books. I was also disappointed with the ending. The book was about a book who was turning into a cat. His great grandpa turned into a cat many years ago...
1,this game is a clone,"this is the worst game I have ever played.It is a complete waste of money because if you don't have the first grand theft auto game you can't even play it. you are an idiot if you buy this!Besides it is no different than the first, same weapons,controls,graphics. I repeat don't buy it!"
1,what the hell is this game,okay first of all when your playing the game the only dam view is a birds eye view dude that to me is like watching a bunch of ants crawl around on the side walk
4,Nice Blend of Styles,"This is great ambient music for holiday gatherings and for playing in your car. I appreciate the blend of styles used in this work as well as hearing the more ""nontraditional"" songs. I was least enamored with their rendition of ""Angels We Have Heard on High."" Perhaps I have too much of the traditional rendering of this song in my head to appreciate what was attempted here. It felt choppy and disjointed. However, the exquisite oboe on other songs more than made up for this initial disappointment. ""O Little One"" ""Walking in the Air"" and ""Masters in This Hall/March of the Three Kings"" conveys the ""comfort and joy"" of the album title as well as the sentiments of the Season. I won't soon tire of this gem!"
4,Classic,"Another old classic of the Play Station that few people know about, but it is a load of fun to play. Four players score goals against each other in a rotating room filled with traps and obstacles. The graphics are not high in quality and you can get tired of it after a few chambers, but it is always fun to play with your friends every now and again. This is a great party game to be taken in small doses. A great way to frustrate casual gamers as they team up against you and still fail against the skilled. This game is worth owning at this price. A nice addition to any collection of party games. If you do not enjoy playing games with groups, then this is not a game for you."
3,non-stick peels,"I've had one of these for about 5 years now. Like so many other reviewers, I got this to fit a old small oval roast pan, and it's just the right size. However, the non-stick never really worked well. Seemed like something always stuck to at least part of the rack. And now, the non-stick coating has cracked and pulled off in several places, exposing the iron rack (which is begining to rust in those locations), and it's now even harder to get clean. I haven't used it very often, perhaps 10 times / year. Things don't last forever, but I was hoping for $20 w/ shipping a bit more life out of this rack."
4,meets a need well,"It took me a while to find a rack that was small enough to fit in the bottom of my crock-pot. One star gets deducted because we are being charged a premium for what this is, and because the little feet are shorter than what I would consider the perfect height. Still, it does hold meat above the surface of the crock which prevents burning, and allows the hot juices to circulate. Very well made, and I would recommend it."
4,Just fine,The product took over a month to get here but I think it will be fine when I start using it.
1,poopy,does not sit very high meat rest in its own juices would not bother buying one these if I was you.
2,Hard to clean,There are lots of little corners for the meat to get stuck in. Its very hard to clean.I reach for others first.
4,"Danesco Roasting Rack, Non-stick","I own both sizes of the Danesco Roasting Rack/Non-Stick. I use them upside-down in my roaster . . keeps turkey/chicken/ribs from sticking to bottom of roaster. They are solid, have some weight to them. I use 1 day/week on average, hand clean, they are wearing well, and I can see getting 10-20 years out of them, easy. Good product, relatively inexpensive."
4,Sweet Game,"This would be 5 stars , but the graphics arn't like Syfon Filter 2 . The cool part about this game is the baby Aliens busting out of your chaters chest . If you dont want baby Aliens' busting out of your chest get cheats from Gamepro.com"
2,another unwanted sequel,"graphics: a bit sub par. environments are all the same sets over and over. the aliens are in the ... flat-3d sprite-like technology from the original ""Doom.""game play: it's not terrible but it just isn't that fun. i've got maybe twenty playstation titles (some, like ""Vagrant Story"" or ""Siphon Filter"" or even ""Spider Man"" i like well enough to continue playing on my PS2 -- there's only so much ""Tekken Tag"" you can take) and this is the only one i haven't even considered revisiting.there are tons of great PS1 titles out there for cheap now. try one of them instead. or save your pennies for the new Game Boy in march, or ""Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty"" or just about anything else.""Alien Resurection"" (like its big screen namesake) would have been better off staying dead."
2,bad control(WHY?),"After all this time waiting for alien resurrection, i finaly got it and i was surprised with the bad controls. I mean why the HELL did they release it without fixing the horrible and frustrating controls. The game's atmosphere is scary and the graphics are ok, but without the solid and smooth gameplay, it's just another frustrating game. Another thing is that the game is so goddamn HARD(dont get me wrong, i like hard games)and with the bitchy controls, it makes it impossible to play. I recommend ALIEN TRILOGY which was released in 1996 and still is a classic and a must buy for action and 1st person fans(also alien fans) SHAME ON YOU FOX AND ARGONAUT."
4,Great Game! But Awkward Controls!!!,"Alien Resurrection was a example of a great game. Great graphics, good sound, great gameplay, but it does suffer from one major factor (THE CONTROLS!!!). The controls are the only major issue in Alien Resurrection. They are awkward, sloppy, and just plain messed up! But if you give yourself awhile to work with it you will get it down in no time. Other than that it is one of the best games that I own. But gamers be warned it is given a M-rating for a good reason."
4,Alien Resurrection is simply superb!,"Fox Interactive and Argonaut have done a praiseworthy job of bringing the second Aliens title to the Sony Playstation. Make no mistake about it - Alien Resurrection is a superbly crafted game, it's intense and atmospheric, possessing in spades the vital ingrediants that any definitive Aliens game requires. The graphics are excellent for the PSX's capabilities, the sound FX and ambience are spot on, the AI is impressive, the weapons beefy, and the Aliens suitably nasty. With ten huge levels of xenomorph-blasting action and some very nice Half-Life-style scripted sequences cutting into the action, this is one game that no Playstation-owning Aliens fan should be without. The ONLY reason I've not given it 5 stars is due to the somewhat fiddly control system - but even that can be overcome with practice and time.BUY IT NOW!!!"
3,"Great graphics and atmosphere, terrible control","GRAPHICS: 9/10SOUND: 8/10CONTROLS: 4/10GAMEPLAY: 6/10This game has great atmosphere, sound, and fantasitc graphics (very dark and creepy), but the controls are horrible. They should have taken a look at the Quake II (PSX version) controls before making this game, because Alien Resurrection really suffers because of it. I even tried playing this with a PSX mouse, but that wasn't much better. I did get accustomed to the controls after a while, but they were still awkward and at that point I was bored with the game anyway - it's just not very exciting. If you are a diehard fan of the Alien movies you will probably enjoy this, otherwise look elsewhere."
4,Useful,"Very interesting book with many, many health food bread recipes. Would recommend to NY one interested in baking with whole grains."
5,O.S.I. Pro 100 Artemia Cysts 3.5 oz / 100g Brine Shrimp Eggs,Length:: 3:48 MinsThis is my video review for the O.S.I. Pro 100 Artemia Cysts 3.5 oz / 100g3.5 Oz. Brine Shrimp Eggs (Artemia Cysts). This review also contains some basic instructions to get you started with hatching your very own brine shrimp using things you probably already have around the house.
5,The perfect snack!,Protons are the perfect snack for our family. I love that therre's a new way to get soy protein into our diets - the younger kids love the sweet ones and our teenage boy lives on the barbq flavor. I'm addicted to the tomato herb and use it in salads daily. We love this product and hope the company comes out with more flavors!
1,I've Read Better Fiction On My Cereal Box...,"This book was a dreadful disappointment to me. A friend at work recommended it highly. I really enjoyed it until I reached the beginning of Chapter 1. Then things got difficult.My main complaint about the book (besides the fact that it moves slowly and is difficult to slog through) is about the characters... they were dreadfully false. Wim is a sorry sack of a man, who gives up what little promise he has to marry Pamela (the most dour and ill-tempered woman he could find). Then after she dies, and Wim contracts a terminal illness, he naturally flees to Pam's nearest relative: Leandra.The book's story line is gut-wrenchingly, heart-sickeningly, bone-crushingly melodramatic, and the dialogue (esp. Leandra's Southern ""drawl"") is stilted and forced.I realize that this is a mean and biting review... but this was one of the worst five books I have ever read. I had to respond."
4,"Somewhat misleading, but good","The title and cover art is a little misleading. The title is taken, I suppose, from Andwellas Dream's ""Love And Poetry"" lp. This compilation does indeed contain some good, rare psychedelic tunes, but the time period covered is 1969-1974, so do not expect a bevy of Sgt. Pepper/Piper/S.F. Sorrow soundalike gems. These tunes are for the most part heading into a heavier realm. For more of this type of music, seek out the Vertigo, Decca, Island and Liberty/United Artists retrospective compilations."
2,just so-so,"I was disappointed to find that these tops & bottoms are so thin that they are sheer. Moreover, they do not feel silky to the touch and ""catch"" like a pair of panty hose on any dry skin (like on your feet when you slip on the bottoms). For the weight of the fabric, they do keep you warm. Since they are thin, they do fit well underneath clothing. If you wanted to use them as pj's around the house, I'd shop elsewhere though."
2,undies,The elastic waist band is very tight on the bottoms which is strange considering how sheer they are. Also if you wear a large shirt buy extra large or xxx because the shirts are tiny.
1,Poor quality,"I bought these. They are warm, yes and comfortable, but I got a runner even though they are plenty big. By the end of the winter, they weill be useless. Tights cost less and keep you warm too."
1,"The worst online purchase, Wondering why Amazon.com not helping me.","This program which was purchased through Amazon.com did not open in my well-functioning desktop computer. I complained of the problem through e-mail but the manufacturer(Global Software Publishing)asked nonsense questions regarding my well-functioning computer. They never mentioned re. refund. On the registration form, U.S.A. is not listed, so you cannot register and the program would work. I complained to Amazon.com which my whole family trust, did not help me, either. Our family is wondering, why Amazon.com included this item in their business.The rate of this item is much less than 1 star !!!"
2,A Good Story But.....How Sad,A well written book but how sad and selfish. The Dutcher's raised these wolves for their personal gain then abandonded the wolf pack when the project was finished. The results were tragic for the wolves. The trust that the humans deliberately built in this pack was betrayed. The Dutcher's should have taken the resonsibility of taking care of these wolves until their natural deaths. This is a true story of man's arrogance and disrespect.
3,The Arroagance of Man,"I found myself in the midst of a book that I was unable to put down. It was compelling and humbling to learn about the wolves. The work of Jim and Jamie was invaluable. Their arrogance is inexcusable. Jim admits he wanted to make a film to expose people to a side of the wolf they may not know. His efforts to carry out this mission were noble and successful. His abandonment of the wolves in the end was selfish and perpetuates the arrogance of our species. The project should not have been undertaken without his commitment to seeing it through. He abandoned the very lives who trusted him most. So it's cold and lonely in the Sawtooth Mountains. Whatever. His commitment should have been until the pack died out, under his care and stewardship."
2,Shame,A well written story but what a shame the pack were not cared for for by the Dutchers for the rest of the wolves natural lives. Captive packs can not lead the truly wild lifestyle they were intended to lead. And to abandon them to the care of others after finishing the documentary showed just how man can use an animal for his own financial gain them walk away from them. At the very least this couple should have committed their lives to a pack they formed for personal financial gain. A good well written story but the last chapters are heartbreaking and show man at his worst.
5,Stevia Without the After Taste,"This particular brand of stevia was recommended in a yahoo group that I am in and I am glad I tried it. I have tried several brands of stevia in the past however, this is the first one that I can honestly say I really like. Mix a little bit in a smidgeon of cream, add a few frozen blueberries - bliss!!"
4,take it from ME,Dont listen to those jerks saying it was a dumb game its relly cool even though the grapics were a little off ok. But befour you play the game you shoud defetly see the movie youll understand it beter.
2,BAD GAME,"When I got this game, I thought it was going to be like the movie, with good graphics and a great theme, but then i started playing and I almost cried just looking at the HORRIBLE graphics, DO NOT BUY this game. I bought it just because i'm a fan of the movie, but stay away from it if you have the chance, it ruins all the good memories you have from the movie. I just want to say to the people who made this game SHAME ON YOU. The only reason i give 2 stars to this game is because i loved the movie and it resembles to the movie in a MINIMUM way"
2,"slow, frustrating","The game makes you think as at the end of a level it says you've only got eg. half the hidden goods so you go back but alas you can't find anything new?? plus I'm stuck on level 7 with leeloo for days hours of play and can't finish so can I find help no, noone will help? there's no walkthrus anywhere and every one I try to chat to about it can't help anyone out there shona.pruden@xtra.co.nz"
3,"Large, difficult to set up, not very sturdy","When I purchased this, it was labeled as a 2-3 person tent. It is large and the entry opening is easy to get in and out of. I found that the tent was difficult to set up. It takes awhile and even when it is complete, it does not seem very sturdy. I was camped out during a slightly windy night and was afraid it was going to collapse. I'm surprised they call this a backpacking tent. I suppose for a 3-person tent, it is lighter than 3 small, light tents, but the bag is rather heavy and bulky. Overall decent and certainly is roomy."
5,Wonderful Item,"I love the Pocket Ref. I've kept one in my toolbox and one in my backpack for the last five years.It has a little information for anything you would need.While it's obvious application is for handymen of all types, any college student will also find it invaluable. I check the pocket ref before any trip to the library. It has saved me many hours of work.The only negative is the type size, if you need reading glasses, be sure to keep them with the pocket ref. Of course any larger type size and it wouldn't be the ""pocket"" ref."
5,So much info to fit in your pocket,This book has more info in it than I'll ever need. I keep finding stuff in it that I never knew I wanted to know!
5,Pocket Resource,"This is a great reference in a convenient size. It occupies a space next to the Machinery's Handbook in my engineering ""tool kit."""
4,i want one for myself,I bought this book for my know it all little brother. I flipped through it and was impressed by the stuff in it. I would be nice to have one for myself
5,"For engineers, etc.",I gave this to a Fararri engineer who is a precision nut! He refers to this often for both basic and exact information. I now give this to friends and family--anyone can benefit from a quick look.
5,"""Pocket Ref"" Is the Best !!","What a great tool - and in such a small package, too!This book has practically everything you need in the way of facts, formulas, conversion factors and other reference items to perform a multitude of tasks.Scientific, math, carpentry, electrical, engineering, plumbing, audio, geography, and many other areas - what you need to know is probably in the ""Pocket Ref.""It now has it's own place in my toolbox.I recently gave a copy as a gift to a good friend. After examining it he said, ""You know, with this book and my construction calculator, I think I could build Paris.""That pretty much says it all."
4,Pocket Reference third edition,This reference has got me out of a jam many times. I recommend this book as a technical resource.
2,Inaccuracy!,"I just browsed a few pages of this ""supposedly"" reference book and I quickly found a mistake in density of minerals (page 356). Thomas J. Glover tells us gold has a density of 17.64. It actually is 19.3. How many other inaccuracies (not typos!) may this book contain?"
1,dont believe everything you read,"The area covering clamping force for Structural A325 and A490 Bolts is irresponsibly wrong. Using the published values will get you in trouble and probably negatively affect the structural integrity of what ever is being erected. As for the rest of the book i cannot comment, but if I can't trust one section, i can't trust any section. [...]"
5,For the Mythbuster in you...,"Look, I'm not going to write one of these long, well thought out book reviews of this little nugget. If it's good enough for the Mythbusters, it's good enough for the common folk, nuff said.Seriously though, I dare you to find a measurement or formula that isn't in here."
5,Engineering guide,This book has every reference you would need in the engineering world from conversion tables to formulas. OUTSTANDING reference guide.
3,Profeesional Achievements Covered Extensively,"Very strong book following Jeff's lap by lap experience of key races in his past. For those of us that know Jeff's professional achievements, the book was fell short in getting to better know him. The book summarizes key personal turning points in his life. Understandably so, he is a guarded person off the track and the book follows that philosophy."
5,Jeff Gordon: Racing Back to the Front--My Memoir,"As a huge Jeff Gordon fan I couldn't wait to get my hands on his book and it did not disappoint. It makes an easy and entertaining read and I found I couldn't put it down. Even if you've followed Jeff like I have for years, the book offers a little more of his personal insight to different situations and what he was really feeling. Not what the media wanted us to think. He touches upon all types of different issues thru-out different stages of his racing career. For any racing fan would enjoy this book, for the Jeff Gordon fan this is a must read !"
4,For race fans only,"I'm a big Jeff Gordon fan and was looking forward to getting some in depth insight into the 4 time Winston Cup Champions life. While it was interesting reading about Jeff's meteoric rise from small time sprint car racer to Winston Cup, the book lacked the emotional grit and openness I had hoped for. This book is perfect for the race fan and certainly Jeff Gordon fans will enjoy the march through Jeff's life on the track...if only we learned more about his life off of it."
5,A+++,Great read.i'm a big fan and liked his story and insight into his life. Would recommend this to anyone that's interested in this.
1,Catastrophic failure!!,"I own a 17 ft. version and used it in the extension ladder mode. As I was climbing it I heard a loud ""pop"" and the ladder collapsed on itself. Fortunately I wasn't seriously hurt. The hinge on the left side broke-I consider that a serious design defect."
3,KNOW WHAT YOU NEED,"The Cosco is NOT as good as Little Giant. But if you understand that from the start, you'll be happy with the ladder.I bought two Cosco 17 footers for less than 30 percent of the cost of two Little Giants. I use them only for temporary scaffolding, with an aluminum platform. I have safety chains on them to prevent catastrophic hinge and lock failures. And I have fall protection on them when I use them. I probably would take the same precautions with the exorbitantly-priced Little Giant. For what I need, they're just fine. If you use ladders professionally, then buy the Little Giant. Otherwise, save the $$."
3,Does not fit car with spoiler !!!!!,Nice price but only fits car without spoiler. Not worth returning so I got the short end. Otherwise it looked like a decent part. I cracked a plastic end taking it back off so be careful. If it was the right part then I am sure it would have worked fine.
2,"OK, but go to the originals first","This book is an attempt to apply Actor-Network Theory to the study of identity. That is an interesting and worthy idea. However, after reading the original articles on Actor Network Theory in the book ""Power, Action and Belief,"" I saw that this book is derivative to a fault. There are not nearly enough footnotes citing Callon, Latour and Law in the correct places. Michael gives some, but not enough, specific applications, and what he does give you can get out of Latour in a definitively written, methodical fashion. The book does have some good into info on Foucault and Fairclough. So, get some good ideas here, but go to the originals first. The editor of this book should have been more on the ball."
3,OK,"This instrument was OK, but it sqeaked everytime I played it.Since it's colorful I had feeling that it was gonna be kinda like a toy, and it was.So before you order this instrument for your kid think twice before you agree with me that you just wasited like $80.Note:We had to play this for school last year."
4,Electric Heater,I am happy with the purchase of my electric stove.It saved me this winter with the cost of gas heat!I do recommend it.
2,"The air stinks, but my sinuses are clear","The title says it all. The smell that the filter emits is hard to describe but certainly unpleasant. On the other hand, I no longer have clogged sinuses and a post-nasal drip. My sense of smell is more acute (I can smell how much I stink now) and my bad breath is disappearing.I wish I'd bought a higher-quality one, but I'm just glad I bought one!"
1,WHY? The air does stink when using this model.,"Why would they make it this way? It doesn't make any sense at all. I don't understand how this air purifier can cause the air to smell after using it but it does. At first I thought it might just be one bad unit. Since I have two I swapped one out for the other. In a 12 by 12 room with the door closed it starts to smell within 30 minutes. After an hour or two the smell is strong. It is an odd smell and I find it unpleasant. The only solution is to leave a door or window to the room open so fresh air can get in - wait doesn't that defeat the purpose of the dang thing? :o)Silly Hunter, why in the world would you make an air purifier which makes the air smell. It doesn't seem to make any sense whatsoever. If I could, I would attach an air sample so you experience what it smells like.As long as you don't mind having a bad smelling room, it works as it is supposed to.Save yourself the annoyance and buy something else."
1,Dont Waste Your Money,I purchased this item and very disappointed. Unlike my other air purifiers this does very little. I tried smoking inside my room and it takes few days to take the smoke out. I does not even make my room stay fresh at all. Waste of money.
3,"Looks nice, but a few problems","This is a great book for the singer that loves musical theater. As a musician though, I would have liked Bring Him Home to be in the correct key. It is a major 3rd below the original key, or at least from what is sung on broadway and any traveling show. I was hoping to use this piece for an audition, but now I will have to see if I can get a hold of the real score since this was published assuming that anyone buying it would be incapable of singing the piece (an insult to the singers buying it if you ask me)."
3,Good but not complete,"I really liked the book and how it treated many of the songs, yet I was really looking forward to singing the song accompanying Javert's suicide. This is not in the book and that was very disappointing to me."
1,Table of Contents is Wrong!,"The table of contents does not match to the songs in the book. For example, ""Castle on a Cloud"" says it is on page 27, however, it really starts on page 25. ""On My Own"" should start on page 58 per the table of contents, yet it starts on page 76. I believe the seller sold me a mis-print or defective version. Not happy!"
4,It's good but it is missing something,I love the play! I got this book so I could learn all te songs. I recieved the book to find out not all the songs are included in the book. It would be helpful to list what songs are included.
5,Another great broadway book...,"If you love Les Miz and want to sing or play the music, buy this. If you love musical theatre, buy this book! It has all the great songs from the show."
5,This is a great book,I bought this for my niece to play on the piano. She is a big Les Miz fan which helps but she really loves it.
5,Perfect,The seller shipped the item quickly and it is great. I play it all the time. My only complaint is that the book doesn't stay open well. The songs are challenging.
3,Packaging could be better,"The coffee is typical Folgers coffee. However, I searched for premeasured filter packed coffee. This was only premeasured coffee and it is extremely difficult to open. It does not come in a filter pack, which is what I wanted in the first place. I would not recommend this product mostlty because of the packaging."
5,Great product and nice gift.,"I got this for my daughter who is 8 years old. She loves making things and being outside. This was the perfect gift. We tried it the first day we got it. Even though you have to wait a week and 1/2 to remove the flowers (as you would with any pressing) it was well worth it. Her ""bouquet"" was actually very beautiful. We placed it in a small, inexpensive frame and displayed it in the house. Once we framed it, the final product looked like something we purchased at a store. For the price, it is a terrific gift to give or just to have. I also am planning on using it with my students so they can make a mother's day gift."
5,this dvd has of the best hbk matches of all time,"hbk and hh have great chemistry and their match at summerslam 2002 is off the charts.one of the hbk's best matches along with the matches against undertaker (hiac,baddblood'97),razor ramon (laddermatch,wrestlemania10),bret hart (iron man,wrestlemania12),mankind(mindgames96),diesel(good friends,better enemies 96),chris jericho (wmXIX),and survivor series 2003.hbk rules!also see rock vs brock"
3,Average PPV,This was an alright PPV it had some great matches but the other matches put the rating down a bitKurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio - 9/10Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair - 2/10Eddie Guerrero vs. Edge - 5/10WWE Tag-Team ChampionshipThe Un-Americans (c) vs. Booker T & Goldust - 5/10WWE Intercontinental ChampionshipChris Benoit (c) vs. RVD - 9/10Test vs. Undertaker - 4/10Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels - 10/10 (match of the night without a doubt)WWE Undisputed Heavyweight ChampionshipBrock Lesnar vs. The Rock (c) - 8/10
4,the best WWE PPV of 2002,Here are the 6 best matches on the PPV that you have to see. Kurt Angle vs Rey Mysterio. Edge vs Eddie Guerrero. Chris Benoit vs RVD. Triple HHH vs Shawn Michaels Street Fight. The Rock vs Brock Lesnar.And Test vs Undertaker. well get this PPV you love it...
5,great event,u wanna talk about a great summerslam..this was one of the best ever..#1 angle vs misterio.great opener with fast pace 8/10#2 y2j vs flair.nice but not great..very slow 6/10#3 edge vs eddie.2 great young stars had a great match that had everything 8/10#4 storm+christian vs goldust+booker t.tag title match.classic tag action.very nice.8/10#5 rvd vs benoit.ic title match.wow.classic encounter i liked this one so much 9/10#6 taker vs test.2 giants fight in a nice match but 2 short.7/10#7 hbk vs hhh.unsanctioned match.28 min of high impact moves.no doubt the match of the night.it was great.10/10#8 leznar vs rock.wwe title match.this was a good one.but should have been longer.8/10
4,This was a pretty good PPV.,"Well the only reason I this was such a good PPV to me was the HBK/HHH match. I never thought it would be as good at it was, but it surpassed my expectations BIG time. The other matches on the show were also pretty good to, like the Angle/Rey match. The crowd really got behind Brock in his match against that overrated people's champion, the Rock. I was loving every minute of it. Anywho, I suggest you buy this DVD when it comes out because it is one of the best PPV's this year for the WWE."
5,WWE Summerslam 2002 Rock vs. Brock,Received in great condition. Any one who is a fan of the Rock would enjoy this dvd.
5,one of the best Summerslam PPVS,one of the best summerslam PPV's that WWE has put on. It was a great PPV show. Excellent show.Wrestling Observer Newsletter award this as the show of the year in 2012
4,WWE SummerSlam 2002 review,"The Kurt Angle-Rey Mysterio match was a high-flying,hard-hitting opener. The Ric Flair-Chris Jericho match was solid,entertaining bout and the same goes for the Edge-Eddie Guerrero match. The Lance Storm/Christian-Booker T/Goldust-World Tag Team title match was not great but pretty good. The RVD-Chris Beniot-IC title match was a high-flying,high-tech,ground-and-pound,solid match. The match between The Undertaker & Test was not great but pretty solid. The HHH-HBK streetfight was bloody,hardcore,hard-hitting,heart-stopping brawl. The WWE title match between The Rock & Brock Lesnar was a solid,entertaining,back-and-forth,ground-and-pound,title bout. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10"
2,Bit better than Vengeance but still needs work,"Sfter a string of hideous PPVs WWE cameout with Summerslam 2002, which many people have hailed as an all-time classic. I beg to differ. While a definite improvement on the last 2 abominations, Summerslam 2002 is still very disappointing. The only good match is Lesnar-Rock, and that's only because of crowd reaction. Otherwise we get a lot of blown spots, long restholds, and political maneuvring. Witness Test destroy the tag team of Booker T and Goldust with one unimpressive kick, only to fall victim to Undertaker in 30 seconds. Watch Ric Flair hold Jericho down like he was Shane Douglas, and marvel at how ANYBODY could find HHH-Michales anything other than boring. Still, thumbs up to Lesnar and Goldust for putting in some effort. It's too bad the rest can't be the same."
5,The Legend Returns,"WWE Summerslam 2002 is action packed from the Opening match to the Main Event! Kurt Angle takes on Rey Mysterio in an excellent fast-paced match, Chris Jericho battles Ric Flair in a huge chop-fest, Edge and Eddie Guerrero face off, but the fued is only heating up between these two. Rob Van Dam wins back his WWE Intercontinental title from Chris Benoit, Booker T & Goldust get {cheated} out of the titles against the UnAmericans and The Undertaker and Test battle it out as well. The Heartbreak Kid, who hasen't had a match since WrestleMania 14, returns to face Triple H in a classic battle. This was a non-sanctioned match by the WWE, and the match consisted of chairs, garbage cans, ladders, and tables! The Main Event of the evening saw the WWE Champion The Rock take on ""The Next Big Thing"" Brock Lesnar, where Lesnar captured his dream by winning the gold, and quite possibly put The Rock on his ""Your career is ended by the hands of Brock Lesnar"" list!"
5,SHAWN MICHAELS IS STILL THE ICON!,"THIS WAS A HELL OF A PAY-PER VIEW.THIS DVD FEATURES THE RING RETURN OF SHAWN MICHAELS.THIS IS HIS FIRST MATCH SINCE 1999!!HE IS STILL THE HEARTBREAK KID- THE SHOW STOPPER- THE MAIN EVENT- AND THE ""TRUE"" ICON OF WRESTLING.IF NOT FOR THE REST, SEE THIS DVD FOR THE BEST-SHAWN MICHAELS!!"
5,Whoa...,"This summerslam is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best I've seen. All of the matches have their good in it but if to pick one, The Game versus HBK. This match honestly almost brought tears to my eyes. Not because I felt bad or anything, but because the match was so dam good it makes you think of how things were before stuff started to change and get all d#%ked up. The Brock and Rock match, that was for sure a good one but I think Rock should have gotten thrown around alot more. A whole lot more. I mean hey even seeing the Booker T and Golddust match made me feel warm inside. This is wrestling!"
4,"Father India, Mother England (usually)","Father India is a very evocative and thoughtfully written book about the experiential travels and tribulations of the visitors that form its chapters.I enjoyed reading the non-religious, non-philosophical, historic account thoroughly..."
3,Standard SF genre fiction about interesting idea,"I first read the beginning half to two-thirds of this story in serial form, back in the days when I subscribed to Analog. Having re-read the story almost twenty-years later, I'm sorry to report that this is a standard genre SF novel. It explores the possibilities of the multiple-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is not bad at all, and the author even has fund creating ""alternate reality"" variations on the characters, but there's nothing outstanding about the novel either."
5,"Blasto is like, wicked cool!!!","Blasto was one of the first games I owned for the Playstation One (rockin' it old-school, yo! 199- something or other), but it was definetly one of the most memorable ones. The jokes are simply hilarious, graphics were top notch at the time, overall fun to play. Everyone should pay homage to Phil Hartman, this being one of his later projects before his untimely passing. Buy it. Play it. Laugh it. Love it."
3,BLASTO HERE TO SAVE URANUS!,"In a far, far, off glaxy a planet known as Uranus is being invaded by space aliens. And now it's up to our hero, Blasto to save to planet. This game is awesome! With the voice of Blasto by, Phil Hartman, there's no doubt that you'll be laughing your head off as you go about blasting the evil aliens, while still trying to catch the Babes on Planet Uranus."
2,Pretty bad,"When it first came out, the graphics for this game were state-of-the-art. Now they are not good. The gameplay is very forgetable as well, it plays like a futuristic Tomb Raider with lousy puzzles.The only possible reason to buy this game is that the voice of Blasto is done by the great Phil Hartman."
2,Fun over Funny,"The game was great for the first few levels, but it is very repeating. The control is good, but the view could be improved. Overall I would recommend renting the game, but don't make the mistake of buying it."
3,Joe's take on the Universe,"Having read widely on both psychic phenomena in general and remote viewing in particular, I found Joe McMoneagle's take on his experiences interesting. I believe he is the most humble and honest of the remote viewers who have gone public, and he certainly had the best hit rate of any of them. That said, I think his interpretation of his experiences went too far for me to follow whole-heartedly. I am wary of his analytic overlay on the raw impressions he received, but found his account of them fascinating!"
1,A Real Dog,"I read this book about a year ago, and guess what? None of the predictions have come true!! No war in Korea, the Pope did not die, no new Gulf War etc. That should say it all. I used to have some respect for the author and his experiences, and I thought Mind Trek was a great book. This book, however, seemed like an effort to cash in on the public's continuing interest in Remote Viewing. Suffice it to say this is the last book, by this author that I will buy"
1,Definitely Overrated,I am very disappointed at the book. The first part of the book is almost a waste of time. Most of the arguments are either too far-stretched or plain wrong. The second part did offer some interesting predictions. But that's about it.
1,Lost me halfway through the book,"After reading David Morehouse's Psychic Warrior and a couple of Russel Targ books and having an interest in remote viewing particularly in going ahead in years, I decided to try this book. I couldn't relate to how by remote viewing he could come up with such very extensive predictions. Even the very near future, seven years since he wrote the book, the predictions for this period were either far off or something that was already in the works in 1998 on the hits. The book was a great disappointment. I still believe in remote viewing but I think his imagination took over in his attempt at predicting the future in this book."
2,More entertaining than watching television,"I can attest to the author's views, because I too have precognition, telepathy, and remote viewing ability. For example, right now I see the author counting his income from the book and laughing at the gullibility of new age readers."
2,I Didn't Care For It,"I was hoping for more than I received. I was hoping for that ""wow"" factor that just wasn't there for me."
3,A sesible guy,I have met Joe McMoneagle while attending the Guidelines seminar at the Monroe Institute. From talking to him I find him to be a very resonable and sensible guy. The subjects that he talks about are very far out but he presents them in a very down to earth way.
3,The Ultimate Time Machine,"The book is a bit dated, but may provide some insight into the practice of remote viewing for purposes of military intelligence, if such a practice actually still exists. No revelations."
3,A bit off..,"When it comes to the predictions and prophecy's writers tend to exagerate things a little. Remote Viewing is a craft that has been designed to gather data,places so on. I understand the idea of 'tryng to see far away'.But come out with dates numbers and events it seems a little bit off. We all know that things change through time medicine, science, technology etc life in general."
1,Overrated,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I kept waiting for the author to ""tell us something new"". I'm still waiting. Most of the concepts of remote viewing have long been public. Stephen King's novel Fire-Starter, and Stargate, both the movie and the series all revealed the existence of remote viewing. Spying using psychic assistance is still- spying. The government doesn't release information on anything that you should know. The saving grace of the purchase was the information on the author's concept of time. Save your money- Edgar Cayce's technique was much better!"
3,Danish Oil?,"I just want to let people know the danish oil on an exterior deck is a mistake, you may never use it on floors and most definitly not out doors. I checked with the Flecto Company,Inc. makers of Watco protectants, and this is the story I got. So much for rich wood tones and good protection. D.J.Griffin Hanover,Pa."
4,Pride FC Championship Chaos,"1.Kazushi Sakuraba VS WanderleiGreat match,but the end will not.****2.Dan Henderson VS Murilo ""Ninja"" RuaThe match was kind of boring, but alot of takedown and couple of punches at someones face.**3.Semmy Schilt VS Masaaki SatakeThis was a okay match. Two guys fighting it off and one is about 7 feet tall. Damn.. ***4.Renzo Gracie VS michiyoshi OharaBoring match. *5.Mario Sperry VS Igor VovchanchynGood Match with alot of blood. Cool............. ***6.Quinton Jackson VS Yuki IshikawaWhat a match.You will see someone do a piledriver. But this match was pretty short.****7.Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira VS Heath Herring.Awesome match. I can't believe it. Very intense with alot of takedown and reversals and some hard punches.*****"
5,Top Notch Recipes,Recipes that win contests represent the best people have to offer. I have tried several of the recipes in the book and found the three bean mexistrone with cornmeal dumplings just fabulous my family requests this one often. I went to the contest site http://www.mom-mom.com and found lots more contest winner recipes that my family asks for.
3,"Red, White and Blue Ribbon 2004","Great book, lots of recipes and it gives a culinary overview of the US."
4,Good motherboard,"The motherboard is fast and reliable. I am happy with it. However, there are a few issues you should be aware of:- There used to be short occasional glitches in sound, but with newest drivers from chip manufacturers there are no more glitches.- CPU temperature measurement can be outrageously incorrect and it changes with BIOS version- Stupid design where the 3rd eye cable remains attached to the case while all other cables can be detached- ABIT support doesn't respond"
4,Very Helpful in Helping Children Understand Consequences,This book is very helpful in helping discipline your children and helping them understand that there are consequences for each one of their actions. Problems (such as - MY CHILD DOES NOT WANT TO BATHE) are listed with all of the consequences that you can inforce that have to do with that problem. In the back there are contracts and job charts that you can copy to help your children learn responsibility. I think this book is an excellent tool to keep you from losing your cool with your children.
3,Nice,"Its a nice stuffed animal. Got it for my niece. My only complaint was that i was under the assumption that it was stuffed with whatever they normally use for teddy bears. Only it was studded with beans like Beanie Babies are. So not quite what i wanted, but still nice."
3,Grat ladder no price,"just like Menards, where I first saw this brand, I can not determine the price......what gives?Matti Aaltonen"
4,Headman - It Rough,"Some neat weirdo electronics on Headman's debut, IT ROUGH. Some funk, some strangeness -- definitely an artist who's operating with his own deck of cards. The title track, ""It Rough,"" scuttles and warbles in both its vocal and instrumental versions, while ""Touch Me"" drives forth on its bass. ""Relish"" starts with a sample from New Order's ""Confusion"" but stakes its own realm with the addition of what sounds like a zither and some trip-hop beats. ""Trying"" has a spaghetti-Western guitar strumming accompanied by some processed baritone vocals. The funk rhythm and filtered melodies of ""Up"" burrow into your skin like scabies, while ""Find a Way"" is slightly more restrained than the other tracks. In a world where too much techno sounds too much like other techno, Headman manages to find his own path: gotta give him props for that."
3,Stars in a son's eyes.,"I have read this book several times and have gone back to it as a source when writing. At first I felt that C.V., Jr's biography was a good, objective view of his mother's life and her place in social history. Unfortunately, as I have read and researched more, I have discovered that Grace was seen as less spectacular by others - especially those European individuals that her son would have us believe are her intimate friends.Short of a minor mention in one biography of King Edward VII, Grace Vanderbilt seems not to have moved in the royal circles to the degree we are lead to believe... and the encounters she does have were viewed with something akin to scorn. The Princess Daisy of Pless, who lived at the very top of Edwardian Society, mentions Grace in her biography, but only in passing. She calls her a ""snobbish little American."" So it would appear that ""the queen of the golden age"" is more a legend in her son's mind, than in the rest of the world's."
3,Little misleading,The photo shows both the tall and short containers. Thought that was what I was getting...nope just the tall ones. Good product..I would rather have a solid stainless top on this....
4,A true-to-life frenzy,"This game is authentic in mostly every way. The camera angles match that of the real World Cup 98', and the players are all there (along with their tricks). You can play this game for awhile (whether you like soccer or not) and if you were lucky enough to find this hard to get game here, just buy it!"
5,Great prouct,We are located in Florida and have many potted plants to protect when freeze warnings are issued. It is a major project for a couple in their 80's to cover them. These plant bags work great and very easy to install. Highly recommended.
4,Perfect for protecting those delicate plants,"I purchased about a dozen of these to protect my delicate garden tropicals. We had a very mild winter, though. They are easy to put on and leave throughout the winter season. Since there is an opening at the top and bottom, you can undo the top and let it drop to the ground on nice days. When a freeze was forecasted, I just went out and pulled it up around the plant. After the last chance for a freeze, I removed them, washed, dryed and stored away for next year. I will buy more!"
1,Small trees died within,"I had 3 Stewart avocado trees that are tolerant down to 20 F. I used the plant protector. The temperature never went below 26 F. Yet all 3 plants died inside the ""protector""."
2,not a valuable book to me,The book is bulky with an average of 2 sentenses per page. The sentenses are also repeated over and over again.
5,Best book on Study Technology.,"I would recommend this book to all parents. Any kid who is struggling in school can learn and apply the techniques of finding ""barriers"" in his/her study and overcome such barriers. My kids are applying what they have learnt in this book. Now when they read their school material they understand what they study. Thanks LRH."
3,DeLonghi Filter pack,"This item is far too expensive, but not the seller's fault; it's packaged in a ridiculously large box, which also makes shipping expensive and only comes with a new filter container which is totally unnecessary. This is the most negative aspect of the DelOnghi coffee pot, which has changed markedly from when they first were made, unfortunateley. I don't fault the seller in this. Also, the picture attached is not the filter, but rather a carafe lid (which is also poor design and leaks)."
3,"Okay, but keep the original plastic holder","It works as a filter, but the plastic handle/holder it comes with was really short compared to the original and made it difficult to place into the water container. Unfortunately, I had already thrown the original one away. Nothing bad about the actual filter though (yet)."
5,Wonderful old fashioned flannel 2 pc button down PJ's!,"My son loves these flannel PJ's. He says these are cozy. His twin brother first made fun of him then stole them to wear them because he now loves them. I have to buy more! We need more of this kind of PJ in different fabrics! Nice to be able to open from the front too if your child is sick to put on vapor rub, etc!"
4,I loved it!,"This is a great game for fans of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. Like the first animated Discworld game you assume the role of Rincewind, forced against his will to yet again save the Disc, this time from a lack of Death. This is much better than the first game because the various puzzles make a bit more sense and you are given clues as to what items might be used for. This game has many apperances by various Discworld characters. Its a great adventure type of game. I have played the PC version but I'm sure the Playstation version is just as good."
3,Amusing Li'l Book of Facts,"This is pretty much your basic bathroom reader, not to put too fine a point on it. It's a compilation of interesting, unusual, and bizarre facts, quotes, deeds, and lists relating to weapons, warriors, and warfare. A lot of it will have been seen previously by knowledgeable readers elsewhere. You've got statistics on the largest battleships, rates of fire of various weapons, tables showing the rank structure of various services, casualty lists from assorted battles and wars, and so forth. I wouldn't call it ""essential"", but it's certainly a good stocking stuffer sort of gift for the amateur military historian in your household.Note that it skews primarily toward American and British history."
4,"Another classic, well made","This game is wonderfully remastered with 3d rocks and sound effects that will have you mind spinning. A nice improvement with 2000 technology. You get plenty of different rockets to blast at the rocks, ships etc. The graphics are excellent."
4,HOURS OF FUN,I REALLY ENJOYED ONCE AGAIN BEING BROUGHT TO MY TEEN YEARS AND ONCE AGAIN PLAYING THE UPDATED ASTEROIDS I THINK YOU WILL ENJOY THIS UPDATE PLUS IT ALSO HAS THE ORIGINAL VERSION I GREW UP ON IT MOVE ALONG VERY WELL AND DELIVERS HOURS OF FUN GET THE CHEAT CODE FROM THE WEB AND HAVE A BLAST IF I CAN SAY SO MYSELF THE GAME IS SIMPLE BUT A BUNCH OF FUN CHIPPIE
2,Accessories,"I would almost recommend you get something else, it's a good price for everything you get...but when you get it it looks pretty cheap, and one of the pieces broke shortly after I tried to adjust it. Also after I bought it I decided I didn't really even need all of it, but for what I needed, it was cheaper to do this than to buy each seperately."
4,Just to let you know.,I have yet to watch it so this review isn't based on the quality of the product. Amazon has this listed as the complete series but it is actually only the first season which consists of 13 episodes. I would of waited for a price drop had I known it was only the 1st season. I think $49.99 is kind of high for 13 30-minute long episodes.
1,The Rabbit Factory,This book was supposed to be funny and interesting and it was SLIGHTLY amusing. Seemed like the author was trying to emulate Robert B.Parker without success. I give this a one star and would not recommend it.
1,Do the math,Sympathetic portrayal of a pedophile + foul language + reprehensible protagonist = one star.
4,Clever yarn with some unexpected turns,Calfornia is not usually my favorite setting for books and I passed the first time I saw this book at my local Borders. Upon second review I decided to give it a shot and I am very glad that I did. The plot and characters draw you in and you become interested in them. Karp throws as good a curve ball as they throw in this genre. This book has heart.
4,Retro mystery,"Flash back to Mickey Spillane and Ed Mcbain. Good read, great setting. I will eagerly start another book in this series."
3,Am I the only one that didn't like thisbook,"The cover quotes James Patterson, saying Karp is the Carl Hiaasen of Los Angeles. I should have paid closer attention since Patterson wrote what I thought was one of the worst books last year titled ""Honeymoon"" Karp is not in the same league as Hiaasen. The writing was bloated not crisp like Hiaasen. With Hiaasen, as you read you can visualize the characters, feel the plot and laugh out loud at the payoffs. Not so with the ""Rabbit Factory"". Hiaasen wrote about a Disney like theme park in Florida a few years back and did it much better.Yes, the detectives are colorful, but whose aren't. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are really more entertaining"
2,100 Page Story In a 550 Page Book,I felt like I was on a treadmill for the first 3/4 of this book. I kept reading and reading and nothing happened. Finally when I had just about given up all hope the plot actually moved forward. The last fraction of the book is actually pretty interesing and fast moving. It is hard the believe the same author wrote that part as wrote the 400 page snoozefest that preceded it.
2,It could have been much better...,"This book had the potential to be a 4 or 5 star book because SOME of the characters were interesting and the dialogue was great.-but-The author was too consumed with making politically correct villains that Hollywood embraces these days, and making sympathetic heroes out of the scum who undermine families.Even if you can overlook that stuff, the book really stalls out three quarters of the way through, and gives you know reason to continue reading."
4,fun summer read,I found this book to be a fun summer read. The book is a page turner with witty writing and a lot of current trivia. I think the story got weak in the end and the author seemed to rush the ending in order to tie up the loose ends. Still it is an enjoyable book and I recommend it.
1,rabbit factory redux,"There is nothing about this book that is any good. At 532 pages, it is the sale of cliche by the pound. Somone needs to unplug this guy's word processor before he types again. O my, that may be too late.I note in an earlier review a warning that no one confuse this outing with ""The Rabbit Factory"" written by the now deceased Larry Brown. The warning is without purpose. Nobody could."
4,An okay read.,"I decide to check out Karp books after reading the latest Patterson publishing mill book with Karp as co-author. After reading this book, I see that they are former ad men that worked together. At first, I thought that maybe Karp needed help to get readers. I think it is Patterson that needs help from Karp to keep is name out there.The story -- good, better in the beginning, but weakened. Some reviewers seem to think this book should be a comedy. I don't see how, even though the characters to have a comedic element to themselves. The ending sort of dragged on over several chapters.Joseph Wambaugh's cops are much more interesting (and funny) than Karp's cops. I will read the next book of Karp's to see where the characters evolve (and the writing)."
4,Good,New author for me. Good read and interesting book. I've read other reviews of Karp with Patterson but like Karp's characters in these two books. Good buy for $2.99 on Kindle.
4,Good Mystery.,"Not sure what prompted me to buy this book, but I'm glad I did. Funny detectives, interesting plot. Bought the other books in the series."
2,Not as good as the others,I was disappointed with this book. The previous books by this author were more interesting and fun. I think this was his first book.
5,Love Karp.,"I recently read the book Karp co-wrote with James Patterson. Loved that book and went looking for anything else Karp had written. The Rabbit Factory is a must read. The prose is witty, the story original and fast moving, and you can't help liking Lomax and Biggs. The lead characters are well written and not ""police procedural"" cliche detectives and the author surrounds them with interesting characters. Looking forward to anything else by Karp."
5,"Kinda short, Very motivating film","I wish it was longer, but it was a very motivating film. I watched it well over a dozen times. I thought it was amazing and I LOVED how they portrayed Dr.Martin Luther King Jr. Splendid performance."
3,Drawn out,"The only thing I knew about Rosa Parks was the bus incident and that's all the movie seemed to show. There were some memorable moments like when she was a child some of her friends switched the signs on the drinking fountains so the whites were now using the coloured one. A white man used the fountain and let his dog use the coloured one. Then there was the time when Rosa was in school and she saw a girl tracing her shoe outline onto a piece of paper because coloured people couldn't try things on at stores. When I watched this movie, I got a sense that the NAACP used Rosa Parks to further their cause. No one there seemed to have an guts so they used Rosa. This isn't a movie I'd recommend, there's just nothing to it."
5,Great Album!! FUN FUN FUN!!,Great release and fun to listen to.Brings a smile to the face each and everytime. Should be a must have for those with funk in their step and fun on their mind!
3,TERRIFYING FUNK FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE,"IF YOU LIKE HERE COME THE MUMMIES, THIS IS A GOOD CD, BUT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE VIDEO WAS ALSO INCLUDED AS THIS BAND IS VERY ANIMATED ON STAGE! HOWEVER, I LIKE THEIR OTHER CD BETTER: EVERLASTING PARTY. IF YOU DON'T CATCH THEM IN CONCERT, TRY SEEING THEM IN ACTION ON YOUTUBE."
1,A real mystery....,"I gave up on this novel on page 17. The writing is muddled and the plot is unclear: the characters are gathered in Denver for a high school reunion, and one of our heroine's friends is murdered. Our heroine is not a suspect because she was caught on videotape at Mile High Statium at the time of the crime, but she seems to be being questioned like a suspect anyway. Why? The her lover vanishes shortly after the murder. Why?--she wonders. Why, indeed?The author seems to affect a disjointed writing style in order to reflect the ditzy personality of her main character, Ingrid. It doesn't work. Punt."
1,Just awful...,"I had to struggle to finish this book--me, who loves mysteries and enjoys almost every minute of even the worst of them! But ""Footprints in the Butter"" was a real turn-off--contrived, trite, and predictable. I knew who did it by page 109 (and I'm a little slow on these things) and the thought of enduring another 140 pages of a shallow heroine, bad jokes, and terrible puns caused me to turn to the last page. By golly, I was right! I didn't even have any regret about missing whatever didn't happen in those pages. All I feel is relief that I am free to spend my day with a better book than this one."
4,Dark comedy with alternating light and heavy dialog.,John Hurt and Vanessa Redgrave have only small but integral parts in this charming movie that Emma de Caunes as Fifi dominates with wit and style. She's a brilliant chef who's hiding out in a diner because she's afraid and she's not even sure what she's afraid of. The other characters are everything from profound to quirky and even insane.Katherine who delivers the food Fifi makes seeks moments of solitude and asks deep questions of total strangers. There's a chef in a neighboring restaurant who's created a rather questionable dish in revenge for being betrayed. The other characters comprise sound boards for Fifi and Katherine as they both seek to find answers by asking odd and sometimes profound questions.This movie made me smile often and left me trying to answer the questions this movie asked.
1,Needed some adult supervision,"I bought this movie on the basis of its 4-star amazon customer rating (overlooking the fact that it had only one single review). It has very colorful sets and is imaginative and quirky--although not always in a particularly satisfying way. In the first scene I thought that I had been sent a French musical by mistake. Much of it spoofs old Hollywood gangster B-movies, except that it is in color, and set in Paris, and features eccentric chefs rather than gangsters, and isn't as well crafted (except for the eye catching sets). If I were a recent post-adolescent I probably would have enjoyed it more, but I spent most of the movie being bored or irritated and hoping that it would eventually have some redeeming quality (other than the delightful sets), and wishing that it had had some adult supervision in its creation."
2,"Interesting, but overstated","The neglected Celtic identity of Southern culture is well worth a study, but I rapidly tired of the contemporary cultural wars and the whole structure of ""them"" and ""us"" which pervades this book."
2,Not for me,I'm a sucker for anything to do with the Altai so I started reading this book with anticipation. By the middle I was sure it was contrived and phony. By the end I had a bad taste in my mouth. I probably will not read anything by Hiltner again.
2,Thank God Gauntlet is finally being brought back home,"Loaded, while fun for a short period of time, is no gauntlet, though it seems to be modeled after that great game. Loaded is ""loaded"" with flashing lights and explosions (sure to send anyone into an epilieptic siezure). These affects make it extrmely hard to keo track of your character. To make matters worse, supplies are extremely limited in two player mode. You must share the already scant resources with your partner. The game does have a lot of blood and violnce, thoug. The graphics, however, are lacking. If you are looking for a mindless shooter that you will be bored of in ten minutes? Then get Loaded. Play it if a friend rents it!"
3,BOOKS THREE and FOUR,"In LEGACY OF THE WOLF, Jennifer Roberson's third and fourth books in the Cheysuli series, we see the the generations move on. This is perhaps the slowest two books of the series but they are necessary to move forward in the many generations tale. Jeez, don't start here, go to the first omnibus and then go to this one. Recommended."
2,"First one wasn't horrible, Second Omnibus is worse.","Classic mistake many fantasy writers make-- build up characters the reader likes and relates to in the first novels, then try to continue the series through children and other strangers to the reader. Roberson takes this to the extreme, in this convuluded second omnibus. Not worth the time (its long) because our favorite charactrs take a back seat."
4,Long yet good,"Slightly repetitive. Long. Type is too small. But very informative--which is why I bought it.Also the binding is very poor. Before I finished reading it the first time a couple pages were falling out. Very poor binding and printing, yet an informative read."
4,Provides Helpful Background for Understanding Luke's Gospel,"Helpful book, well written, thorough, but now somewhat dated. However, for the patient reader, Marshall's remarks provide opportunites for reflection and thought. Good introduction to his commentary on the greek text of Luke's Gospel. For the pastor, helpful resource to have on one's bookshelf."
3,typos/poor editing,"if you can sift through the extremely poor editing and typos (1 per page), you will get to the content...which offers a few examples and comprehension testing."
4,Customer Centered Selling: Eight Steps to Success from the World's Best Sales Force (Purchased on 08/24/2010) by Robert L. Jo,The product was in very good shape! Only thing written on the book was a greeting on the first page. I was happy with my purchase
5,Reader,"I read this bood in the Chinese translated version. It is very similar to the book ""Solution Selling"", afterall, both authors were trained by Xerox Corp. A bit technical in this presentation compared to Solution Selling. Both very eye-opening to the art of selling. Great book. If you want to master selling and be the top sales person in your firm, this is a book that can help you get there."
1,confusing the title with CustomerCentric Selling,"Little more than a rehash of Solution Selling from 1983 and a clear poor man's version of CustomerCentric Selling from 2003. You would be better served checking out the latest version of CustomerCentric Selling from Bosworth, Holland and Visgatis.(ISBN-10: 0071637087ISBN-13: 978-0071637084)I can't believe that the author did not reference CustomerCentric Selling for his work. The stages are very similar to the first version of CustomerCentric Selling, but the author is still using the old techniques of selling rather than the sales ready messaging endorsed by the American Marketing Association and the process that has changed selling organizations globally."
4,"I red it all in one day, couldn't stop!!","It's a good story, it's written in a way that I couldn't stop reading till I finished it.I am going to reed more books written by this author."
2,We now call this emotional abuse,"This book is as chauvinistic as it can get. Some people might like the main male character, Russ, being mentally abusing to the heroin but that's just not for me. He spends the entire book provoking her and then yelling at her or calling her names when she responds to the provokation. And no one else in the book seems to see (or just doesn't want to see or doesn't care) how much he hurts her until the very end, otherwise they just excuse all his actions because he's a hard man. It also bothers me that she apologizes all the time after he's mean to her. I've found that Diana Palmer books are either a hit or a miss. A lot of her characters are abusive and the heroin just takes it while saying she loves him. I have found a few that are real love stories where the hero doesn't have to be abusive to be the macho man character Palmer seems to favor, but they're hard to find."
4,A lot from one book,"I had origionally read about this chef/author in the book Home Food so I researched more articles on the woman. In the end I bought the book for my daughter because the book had a lot in it. My daughter had asked for a book on technique and this book instills confidence for the beginning cook. Along with good recipes there is a lot of information on substitution of ingredients and timing. She really teaches how to think ahead in cooking, Her recipes are lovely variations on the familiar. As it is summer in Seattle as I write this, I had only hoped that it would have more seasonal food. It is a book for someone living on a coast. I find myself borrowing this book from my daughter quite a lot."
5,Page turner,Very suspenseful and also well-written and perceptive. The steamy atmosphere of a girls' boarding school is rendered with great precision here. I highly recommend.
3,Good book marred by an unlikely ending,"Reading this book was like seeing several familiar elements mixed together in a new way. Lord of the Flies meets Picnic at Hanging Rock meets Walkabout meets the Wildfire Club. I found Kohler's portait of girl-crushes at a remote boarding school evocative and compelling. She uses setting well - the stiffling African heat followed by chaotic rain. I was also intrigued by the 2nd person plural narration, and by the fact that one of the characters shared the author's name. However! The ending - oh the ending. I didn't believe it for a second, not for those characters. It was as if the author felt she had to have something appalling up her sleeve for the book to be worth it or didn't believe that less graphic betrayals can be deeper and more believable.Ultimately, I found this an intriguing novel, but I wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend it because of the disappointing ending."
3,very weird,"this was possibly one of the strangest books i have ever read. it's kind of a female ""lord of the flies"", in a way. a bunch of school girls are competing for the affections of their swimming coach. they hate the coach's favorite, fiamma, and will do anything to dethrone her. kohler's prose is good, and i thought how she made herself a character was very interesting. but the story drags a bit towards the end and i found myself getting bored. the story was odd enough to keep my interest though."
1,Not worth your time,"This book was awful, I'm embarrassed to say I wasted my time reading it. My initial interest was that it's set in South Africa, but the setting didn't play a very large part. I try to never not finish a book, but this one did not redeem itself with the revelation of the ""event""- I thought it was disgusting and unrealistic."
2,"disappointing, depressing and dull","i see that others have given this book five stars, which is why i bought it, but the truth is i'm sorry i did. i actually had trouble finishing it. there was so much foreshadowing from the jacket blurb to the reviews to every sentence on every page to every mosquito buzzing through the air, etc. that i was finally guessing what was going to happen and wishing they would get it over with. i never liked any of the characters, and in fact the author did not give us anything to like. i read all the time, including many south african authors. i think a much better novel on the same theme was Marita van der Vyver's Childish Things. it could be that this particular book is just not for me, but i am unlikely to pick up any of this author's other works."
3,Sexually honest and disturbing,"Remember when you were a pre-teen. Were you curious about sex? Were you curious about other people's bodies?This disarming novel focuses on the innocence and sexual curiosity of a group of pre-teen girls who find themselves in a strange situation when the outsider of the group mysteriously disappears. They knew that their swimming coach had a strange obsession with her, but was she responsible for the girl's disappearance? The ending will shock you. It is a disturbing and sexually honest novel about the age of innocence and curiosity. The novel is utterly original. I highly recommend it."
4,intense and atmospheric,"A lot of novels have been written about boys' schools, from If to Lord of the Flies, but this is a closely observed and intensely felt girls' story. You can feel the heat shimmering and the emotions on the boil -- it's extremely intense. I read it in one plane ride, and thought about it for days."
4,Upgrade version,"Because this is an upgrade, most users will be familiar with the product.My complaint is that, while it comes with 90 days of support, by the time it is delivered and installed, you only get about 60 days of support. Learning this software is like trying to get a PhD in Astro Physics and the training is outrageously expensive. The difference between 90 days support and 60 days is probably worth 6 or 7 hundred dollars. It's like the old ad for Listerine. I hate it but I use it.----"
4,Walking in God's Promises,This looks like it will be a great study for a group of Sr. Ladies at our church. It's not overwhelming and has an interesting perspective. Looking forward to using it in Sept.
4,The Best of the Guidebooks I've Seen So Far,"Honestly, I've been living in New York for the past two years, and I think I have a reasonably fair grasp on its nighlife, restaurants, whathaveyou. Not only did this book have a listing of some of my favorite spots, but it talked about some places I wish I'd known about earlier. Some good stuff here."
2,Disappointing - overpriced,"This book, excuse me, leaflet, is poor at best. It's a WAY over-priced paperback chock full of simple examples from the TV show and illustrated by a preschooler. It has been more useful on my desk as a humor piece than anything else. Some examples:""Make a Car Drive Itself"" (Duct tape & a Belt)""How to Escape from a Pit of Snakes"" (Kerosene lamp & an entertainment lawyer)""Undress a Woman without Using Your Hands"" (paperclip, thread, woman wearing a zip-up dress, and a crowd of innocent bystanders)Please do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one."
1,"Sometimes, a book just isn't any good.","A neat idea, but its not very funny and any information could be gotten from wikipedia or just watching the series. Not what I was hoping for."
3,TV Treasures: A Companion Guide to the Brady Bunch,I was very disappointed with this book...not at all what I anticipated.
1,"Endless Talk, No Action . . .","This novel was a deep disappointment. It was not unexpected that political maneuvering among the princes of the star empires, such as the Steiner-Davions or the Kuritas, would be important in the opening chapters of the book, since such exposition usually sets the stage for the story. However, in Grave Covenant, the talk never stops and the action never starts. As of page 180, nothing has happened except endless conferences and endless political maneuvering. In the second major section of the book, I expected battles and action would begin. Still nothing happens. The only difference is that the endless talking occurs on a jumpship, not in palaces. I consider this book almost unreadable. It is deadly dull. I love the Battletech novels, but suggest that some of the others are better reads."
4,Excellent plot and very well written,"I have read some writers but stackpole tops them all,When it comes to science fiction I will always think Stackpole.Welll written and Well datailed I have found Grave Covanent to be my favorite of thiis series so far."
5,The Good Fairy,"Penned by the peerless Preston Sturges (""Sullivan's Travels"") and directed with flair by Wyler, ""Good Fairy"" is the kind of brassy, urbane romantic lark that Ernst Lubitsch was perfecting in the early '30s. Sporting an irresistible good-girl charm, Sullavan never shone brighter than here, cleverly fending off Morgan's priggish, overheated Konrad and gently falling for Marshall's gallant, bewhiskered barrister. (Even Wyler was smitten--he married his ""Fairy"" as soon as the shoot ended!) Alan Hale, Reginald Owen, Eric Blore, and Cesar Romero target the funny bone in hilarious side roles, chewing up Sturges's saucy, snappy dialogue. And so will you."
2,This game is awful!,"It's a shame that such a cool TV show spawned such a crappy game. The graphics look very blocking and nothing like the TV show, the music is just some of the themes from the show looping over and over, and the play control is awful.I never was able to make it past stage 4 or show, because racing around that particular level trying to destroy an APC carrier was just too hard. It's a shame, because I was hoping I'd be able to explore a virtual Mainframe and the like."
2,you call this a game,"I bought ReBoot back in January and I still have not beat it yet,to make matters worse I have not even beat level 10! This is one of the worse games I ever bought and I don't plan to play it any time soon. First the controlles to the zipboard are way to hard and the puzzles are so hard to solve that it can drive you nuts! Trust me save your money for another game. This game is not worth it."
5,awesome,I had been looking for this game for months. It was good quality. My kids were excited to play it.
2,Not That Great,Not as fun or captivating as other great play station titles. I'd pass unless you get a good deal on this game. Good deal = less than $10.
1,do not buy it!,"this game is the worst i have ever played. The graphics were awful, it was dark and everyplace looked the same. The controls were even worse. fighting combo's were too hard to execute and the character never walked in the right direction. it is fun to kill monsters for a while, but after a while it is boring. do not buy this, save ur money!"
3,kinda weird,theres this dude in one of those you cant see youself games going around and shooting at monsters.thats really about it.its pretty straught forward for a while.its not very obvious what youre supposed to be doing and that always sucks.i like knowing what im up against.its pretty good.
2,Lode Runner,"This game is not very good and makes a poor transition from the old PC days with the blue bricks and red villains to the Playstation console. The gameplay is the same, but the controls are terrible and do not react quickly. The graphics have been improved, but without smooth gameplay and unless you are a die hard Lode Runner fan with patience, this game is not worth the time nor the money."
1,I am sticking to Zane!,I read the 50 pages fast. It is not what I expected it to be. It was a waste of my time. This author is a minister? Where is this church. I do not recommend this book to read. I am sticking to Zane.
3,The original printing was better,"I have the book some young man gave my Grandmother in something like 1895. But the pictures shatter when you open the book, so my mother purchased a cheaper copy in better condition. This is a book I know well. This version is a computerized scan which was printed. The story is there, but every once in a while you get mistakes. Also, the original chapters have gotten lost, in garbled print in that area. The original book is either impossible to find, or you get this one, but at quite a good price, considering.The story actually is quite good, in an old-fashioned way. Who is to inherit Avonsyde? Rupert, the stalwart, noble cousin, or Philip, the gentle sickly one, who charms everyone, and who is loving to all. The characterization is rather good, the action moves along. It is clearly written as a young person's book, but it's a decent read. I've always enjoyed it, it's one of the books from my childhood."
1,Wrestling and Wrangling,"I warn everyone, and their neighbor, and their neighbor's dog, to steer clear of this kind of drivel masquerading as ""academic research"". Monnett simply preys on his faithful but unwary readers by wresting the scriptures in service to his personal agenda, and wrangling the facts to fit his bizarre conspiracy theory. If you buy this nonsense, then I know a guy from Nigeria who wants to make you a very rich person - I'll hook you up for a 10% cut of the profits.For a more detailed critique, see [...]"
2,red trivet,"With the shipping, this is way overpriced. It is fire engine red - I mean, really, really RED - and looks like I paid a couple bucks for it at a yard sale, which is what someone else will do when it appears in my yard sale next spring...."
2,Hardly Rose-Tinted Spectacles,"The pageant on display here offers rather a sorry spectacle, akin to mangy toothless lions and geriatric tightrope-walkers. Although the three murders seem to have something theatrically extravagant in their appearance, behind the gaudy costumes and elaborate stage-setting is nothing more than a rather dull series of murders, committed by a villain we hardly know for reasons that seem insufficient in a manner that is unconvincing. The star performer, Dame Beatrice Bradley, hardly appears, and, however good company Laura Gavin and Kitty Trevelyan-Twigg may be, they are really no more than understudies. Unsurprisingly, the audience is not amused."
2,The audio didn't match up with the video!!!,"I had to send it back, The audio didn't match up with the video, there was a few second delay. Maybe you will get lucky and the one you get will be made the right way. Good luck!"
5,A Must Read!!!,"The book covers important aspects of Uraban Education, and the theorectical information that apply to education.Special Education Teacher"
1,I'm still questioning this one.,"Two words:STAY AWAY! I'll tell you one thing this game will burn that hard earned money and shove it in your face.When you first get it , it' fun for five minutes then it's through.The graphics are ok but they get old. Bad controls , boring levels , stupid enemies and horrible intro. Get Crash 3 or get Bubsy 3D(hey it beats this game)and save your money"
1,Beware!!!,Im a 11 year old kid that was brain washed by the stupidity of potty humor jokes from this book.A principal running around in his underwear shooting underwear everywhere is wierd. So all that I can say this is a book for a four year old....
1,Another nonsense diet,"The problem with this whole series is the insistence on potty humor, undergarments and general crassness. Yes, it appeals to a lot of children. Parents like the idea that children are reading. But, children who grow reading a steady diet of poorly written nonsense do not develop a taste for good literature easily.There are many other options for reading. These ""Underpant"" books are written with repetitive vocabulary which prevents children from obtaining an adequate one.It is also formula writing.Your child wants to read this? Insist that he also reads something of more value.......For my children, I refused. I have been keeping track of these books and have been confirmed in my decision."
5,Here Comes da Wedgie!!!,"This book I read was a mixture of fun and sadness. It's about two kids Harold and George that hypnotize their teacher and she turns bad. She turns into Wicked Wegie Woman. She goes around the city destroying the buildings, cars and stores. She destroys Captain Underpants but he becomes free. They beat Wegie Woman by hypnotizing her again.I really recommend this book because it's hilarious. I hope you read this book next.Zac, R.I"
4,Captain Underpants and the wrath of the wicked wedgie woman,"Captain Underpants the fifth epic novel tells the truth when it says action, terror, and laughsIf you don't read this book you don't know what you're missing. If you are looking for trouble look no further. Come and read about George and Harold. George and Harold are always pulling pranks on signs, Mr. Kupp, and Ms. Ribble. Believe it or not there mean old principal is really Captain Underpants. There are five more Captain Underpants books that continue the laugher and action.By:Eddie"
5,Mom....What's a Wedgie?,"I am not sure who had more fun, the children or myself with this book! I enjoyed reading it to them as much as they enjoyed reading it over and over. Highly recommended for those who enjoy good old fashoined kid fun stuff."
3,Ha Ha,I think that captian underpants ect ect is a thrilling and entertaining novel iam 9 years old. all my freinds loved this book for all ages i am also a fan of jeremy strong and jaquline wilson so if you like this book i'm sure you'll like jermey strongs and jaquline wilson.
5,Funny Boook,Captain Underpants The Wrath Of The Wicked Wedgie Woman is a tricky book because Goerge and Harold are two friends in the same class and they play tricks on the teacher and the principal.For an example George and Harold went to the principals office and had a letter the principal wasn't suppose to get so he turned it in to there teacher and it said will you marry me.After that the kids were at school that Saturday for the wedding butthe taecher called the wedding of and was talking about the principals nose. I'm sure if you read it you would love it.
5,Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Women,Tra la la la laaa Captain Underpants saves the day once again. Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedge Women is about There teachers retirement and they draw a comic about her then give it to her. After that she becomes the Wicked Wedge Women and gets her revenge on them. Its up to Captain underpants to save the day. The theme of this story is to be nice to people and they will be nice to you. Dav Pilkey might have wrote this because of the stuff he did when he was a kid because he has AD-HD. Another reason he wrote this is because he wanted to entertain people with his books and write about his childhood experiences with some fiction stuff in it. Captain Underpants is a significant book because it is super hilarious. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes comedy books.
2,not what i expected,"i really expected a more challenging and more accurate piece of music. if you are a beginner, this is a ok piece to try out. but if you are looking for the fun, upbeat more challenging piece of Linus and Lucy, find a different arrangement"
4,A great bible!,"What a blessing to have a bible like this one. the notes are absolutely inspiring and wonderful, the scriptures come alive and we are reminded day to day what little we think of god and how much we should bow down and worship him as creator and lord who loved us so much. The other thing i liked about this bible is the fact that you can also receive a free cd with the purchase, i highly recommend it to the worshipper at heart"
1,Just goes to show . . .,"Sometimes it doesn't matter if a book is well-written. Sometimes it should have never been put on paper in the first place. If I were ever to be put through an ordeal anything similar to what Elizabeth Smart has been through, I would be even more devistated not to have the support of my own family. If Elizabeth's family didn't want this book published, why would her own uncle do such a thing? I can only think of one reason - money. Such a shame that he felt the need to commercialize on his niece's traumatic situation. Send her flowers, take her to Disney World, buy her a puppy - what good has he done by glorifying this experience that she would obviously want to forget?It seems that many reviews of this book in favor of it having been published come from Utah. The result of a neighborhood block party, perhaps? Let it go. Elizabeth wants to let it go, her parents want to let it go, respect her wishes."
1,"Tabloids, Newspapers, Beware","Just more sensationalism on a topic that should be closed to allow this girl to live her life.For those who like to read the tabloids, it will be great. For those who respect Elizabeth's wishes to live a life of privacy it will be a betrayal.Too bad her uncle didn't think of this.Making money off pictures of Elizabeth to give to charitable causes? Publishing a book so the proceeds will go to charity?People will justify the writing, but Elizabeth lived the story.She didn't want the book published.That says it all."
1,Self-Serving and One-Sided,"I read this book because I was interested in hearing the details of the investigation and how they lead up to finally finding Elizabeth alive. Not knowing before hand that the family did not wish to see it published. I was surprised to find it very self-serving and one-sided. The uncle talked about himself more often then anything else, and was obsessed with exonerating his name even though the entire country now knows that he is not guilty. It was very poorly written with way too many unnecessary details. He repeated himself over and over again it seemed to draw his story out into a full length book. He also brings in so many ""characters"" that the reader gets confused as to who everyone is."
3,Interesting but her parents book is a little easier to read,I was completly stuck on the Elizabeth Smart case when it was all unfolding. I was graduating high school at the time and couldnt imagine with all the dreams I had having them all stolen in the middle of the night. The book is a good read and really details the case well. The only problem I had is the book seems very very one sided. The brother talks all about how much he did and the others did and I kinda felt like he was acting as if he was the parent. It may just be the way I read it but I did find it interesting to get a good profile of the people that took her. Its worth a read but dont forget to read her parents book too.
2,"Don't buy this ball, get the Wilson Evolution for Indoor Play","This ball is hard a rock, warps very easy and wears out quickly. Do yourself a favor and save the extra dough and get a Wilson Evolution ball."
5,astonishingly beautiful,"this is some of the most spiritually uplifting, astonishingly beautiful music ever. it literally takes you to a place of great ravishment and joy.recording, perfomers, selection and above all the composer are sheer perfection."
5,The Top,"Although I much prefer Reinhard Goebel's rendition of Biber's Mystery Sonatas to Andrew Manze's, Manze owns the composer's 1681 sonatas in this release. I suppose I should try sampling other versions, but I just don't want to, feeling that I've already found perfection. Biber and the next generation's Jan Dismus Zelenka have always been my offbeat Baroque composers of choice, and the former's inventiveness and originality are certainly on display in these works, rendered so marvelously by Manze, accompanied by lutenist Nigel North and keyboardist John Toll. Other reviewers have gone into far more detail than I'm capable of; suffice it to say that these two discs provide one memorable sonic journey. Highly recommended."
4,Fine product - delivered promptly,I got this for one of our carpenters who kept banging up his Treo. He likes it and hasn't damaged his Treo since he got it.
4,2 Thumbs up!,The Cellet pouch hold the phone well in the upright position. Do not let the rotating clip fool you. It WILL NOT hold your Treo well enough to keep your phone from taking a swan dive. :{ I found out the hard way... My previously unscarred Treo got a battle wound on its maiden voyage out of the house.I like the holder as it is though. It is easy to retieve and place.
1,Was sent the wrong clip,"The company sent me the right case but the wrong clip. I contacted the company and went back and forth with them for a while and I haven't heard from them since. Mistakes happen, but fix them."
4,Works fine with the 755P Treo,"Bought this when I had a Treo 680, but it didn't work as well as it does with my current phone, the Treo 755P. I felt like the 680 would constantly slide out of this case and it did once or twice. The Treo 755P seems a little lighter and has never fallen out of this case. It should be a of a tighter, more snug fit but it still does the job."
2,Must be made for children not adults,It says one size fits all but I am an adult with slender legs and I struggled to get it over my knee. They were comfortable worn as shin guards bur were extremely uncomfortable over the knee.
3,Mixed messages,"The documentary is worth seeing, but I was nonplussed by the dismissive comments by the crew members who were interviewed.Listening to them, you'd have no idea that all the actors did a great job, the movie had both good and bad reviews, it made its costs back, and it's widely considered a minor classic today.In general, the documentary doesn't provide enough context for the discussions of Monroe, although I can well imagine that she strained everyone's patience.During the filming, Monroe was suffering from exhaustion, endometriosis, colitis and gallstones, apart from emotional issues related to rejection by Yves Montand and the failure of her marriage to Arthur Miller."
3,Yester Year,"Apparently made for television, it presents remaining POVs from this involuted crew, and raises more questions than it answers. Presentation and photography are good to excellent. Personal myths are interesting.Definitely worth having if you are seriously interested in this ""Nodal"" film known as ""The Misfits"" I decided that I have to read the book. Much appreciated."
3,Not much more than old legends,"Making ""The Misfits"" must have been amazing for film-buffs who happened to find themselves in Reno in the early '60's. Surprisingly, the people interviewed for this documentary aren't really fans at all, but relatives of those who were there, film-historians and folks who worked on the picture second-hand. Nobody seems very giddy about their memories, and they retell their old stories in a slightly dazed, distracted fashion. I did find it interesting that, near the end, most everyone reluctantly admits that the movie simply didn't work and is therefore one of the most legendary Hollywood flatliners of all time. I loved bits and pieces of ""The Misfits"", and anyone else with the same mixed reaction will end up wanting more depth and personality regarding the picture and why it all went awry. There are some fascinating photos displayed, making one wish he had been there too. B-"
2,So so,"I had high hopes for this book. There are so many good things said about Farris. However, it just didn't work out. Perhaps I'm a stick in the mud but I like to see dialog called out through the use of quotation marks. Add to this, the jarring transition to a movie script, close to the end, and you get a novel that seems more like an experiment than it does a full-fledged effort.The escalating encounters with Crow, the subsequent escapes by the lead characters, the anti-climactic denouement of Crow, and the head-shaking finale, were just too much with too little payback. I feel like I wasted time on this book that could have been better spent on something else."
4,An entertaining read,"I enjoyed this book, however I felt that there were so many unused elements. The heroine was a Math genius. I thought she would use this to fight Crow, but this didn't happen. Also the hero--the cop, knew a professor I think it was who had some insight into the undead, yet this was not used or fleshed out. Also I think the end should have occurred more toward the middle of the book. It would have been interesting to see this scenario played out further."
5,"Purity, Grace & Vision","This jewel of poetic prayers to the soul from Interfaith Minister Lee Ann Fagan Dzelzkalns, provides loving, gentle guidance on the path of conscious awareness. There is a beautiful, soft flow to the rhythm of this work which as I read it, enfolds me in a field of love from the angelic realm. The book begins with a Prayer of Service: ""I am flowing love, light and presence, As I blend with the highest of Essence. I am open and available in this day, To God's Grace and unfolding way."" As you progress through the Gateways of release and renewal of the Self, you arrive at a place of being with the Unconditional Self. Do not just read this book, meditate with it and you will find it touching you on a deep and personal level as the cleansing waters of Spirit that flow through its pages, renew and inspire you. A beautiful gift for yourself and your loved ones."
2,Yes... We have played the game...,"To those who rate this game highly, despite their lack of play, to ""even out ratings"" before release... Yes, we have played this game, it's called a BETA TEST, and, JTL is the same old SWG grind in space, its boring, and unless you are a current SWG player and you have a lot of time to waste, stear clear of this one!"
1,Well...,If they couldn't get the core functions of the game to work then what makes you believe that this is going to work any better?
1,Main game unfinished,"The main game (which you need to play this expansion) is very buggy, it's unfinished and extremely unbalanced. In short it's no fun at all. The developers are ignoring their own customers by releasing this expansion while the main game is in such a poor state, full of huge KNOWN problems.Stay away from this expansion until the main game is fixed. Trust me, you don't want to waste your money on SWG in its current state."
1,stay away,"SWG is sinking fast. Just stay away and wait for a better game. No, ""Empire at War"" isn't any good either."
1,Broken,At the beginning the game is fun. This soon fades however as broken game mechanics and an even longer stream of broken promises continue to ruin the game. My verdict : avoid it until its fixed and ready for play.
1,Why pay for something that wont be finished?,It is very disappointing that SOE and LA is releasing this expansion and charging people for it. The core game of Star Wars Galaxies is far from finished. Many of the professions are broken and there is very little content.Do not waste your money on this one until other elements of the game have been fixed.
4,Great game,"Hi, i have been Beta testing this game it is a very good expansion, there are a few thibks they could work on such as letting rebels use the the ship similar to the millenium falcoln, but besides that and a few other things it is pretty good and space travel is pretty smooth. i say if you own star wars galaxies this is a must buy."
2,Just wanted to correct some misconceptions,"1) The GCW revamp will NOT be another expansion. It will be in a publish (probably after the CR) after JTS. This is *as of this writing*. The CRM has made some comments that lead me to believe they are going to rethink the decision about the scheduling of JTL and the CR2) Everyone who buys JTL will receive a ""starter ship"". You will not need to scrounge for cash before getting into space; you will be able to get into space as soon as you can get yourself to a StarportOther than that, I don't have much to add. This is probably the most complex MMORPG ever made, and the expectations were very high. This game has tremendous potential, but as others have said it won't be realized for another 12 months or so. Pick it up in late 2005 and see what you think! :)"
2,what could have been,"the core game has to be purchased along with jtls there are many flaws in the core game which the deveolpment team had a schuduel outlined for fixesrecently it was annoucned all major stuff on hold till after the expansion was released, thus you have an rection to that announcment herefolks paying for one game not being fixed while another is being developedthe space game is a twitched based game not everyone that plays swg was planning to buy the expansionyet due to the expansion may have to wait a year or more for there Known bugs and classes/proffesions to be fixedi would proceed with caution and re look at this offering during a free trial, or a year from now which should give 6 months of bug fixes to jtls and an additional few months to core game to be worked onthis is a buyer beware"
1,Jump To Slowspeed,"What the other people have said is true. The ground game has many problems and the promised fixes are as yet to come after thay were said to be in the works as of Dec 2003 (the combat system fixes for example).With a basic part of the game like the combat system, that effects all players, in need of a complete overhaul SOE decided to overhaul the Jedi instead (who are only a small part of the player population).In order for you to play Jump To Lightspeed you HAVE to play the ground game so even though few of us went to the convention and played JTL we can say that JTL will not be very fun because of the problems with the ground game.I don't know if there is or will be problems with JTL but im sure there will be. SOEs ablity to run and fix this game is very low and so I will leave SWG and will not buy JTL. Mabe one day thay will get it right but as for now im staying away."
5,BEST GAME EVER MADE!!,"Please do not listen to what anyone says bad about SWG! I is so cool!SWG; A online roleplaying game where you can live in the star wars worldAlmost 10 different races to choose fromTons of planets to exploreRequired; a goood video card, a certain amount of space on your computer, an internet connection, and a subscription.JTL;You can ride in spaceshipsupdatespachesnew guns and thingsOverall, this game have been my dreams come true!! I truely love it. (...)"
1,"Same old, same old once novelty wears off","After spending two weeks playing the beta of JtLS, hoping upon hope that it would somehow save a dying game that I really wanted to succeed, I realized that all I had done was waste two weeks of my time.I played SWG when it first launched in 2003. I stuck around for a few months, but then cancelled due to sheer boredom. I started up my account again about one month ago in hopes that the new expansion would breathe new life into the game. However, the game mechanics still turn playing into a job. No thanks, I already have one of those, don't need another that I actually have to pay SOE for.JtLS puts a shiny new face on the same old grind, and once the novelty of flight wears off you're left with the same old thing.ZzzzzZzzZzzzzzz"
1,Does not play! crashes PC 100% of the time.,"The game crashes my machine when I try to play. Considering that I can not play this game at all, I consider this to be a complete failure!"
2,Reason to reconsider Purchase...,"The ONLY reason I would suggest NOT buying this at release, is simply because its an add on (meaning you have to also BUY the Core game Box title) to a very badly produced game.SWG has many awsome things within it. Many Many concepts have a great deal of potential, However the implimentation of it has been far from stellar.The biggest issue at this time is that while you may buy this expansion..you start where everyone else starts...On the ground. Players make everything...including ships. We CHARGE..so you will have to spend time making cash before being able to be in space in a craft that is worth being there in.The CORE combat system is radically unbalanced..as such I wouldn't recommend buying this untill your sure of the Core Games Stability and Balance."
1,Avoid SWG like the plague.,"This game still has <b>many</b> bugs from release, over 1 year ago. The players were just informed that those bugs will not be fixed until the expansion ""Jump To Lightspeed"" is finished and shipped out. Know what that means, they're taking the money players have paid for over a year of service, and dumping it into financing an expansion pack.Play this game at your own risk, but know this: The money you're paying them to play will <b>not</b> be used for service. It will be used to finance their next project.Oh, and their customer service is non-existant. Always has. Always will be."
1,Never trust SOE,Non-existent customer service. Very buggy core game. After 1 year StarWarsGalaxies is still practically in BETA. I have zero faith in SOE and I will not be purchasing JTL.
1,Can't endorse this development team,"Six months ago I was certainly looking forward to the Galaxies expansion that took us into space.Today, there's no way I would buy another product managed by this development team. Crucial fixes to broken and unplayable systems in the base Galaxies product have gone unfixed for six months (despite constant developer assurances that these problems were being 'worked on') and customers only recently found out that key fixes to the in-game combat system and the high-end Galactic Civil War content would be delayed yet *another* four to six months while work on this space expansion was prioritized.Just an understaffed, poorly managed development team ... very little progress on getting the game polished in the last six months, and today I have no plans to buy Lightspeed whatsoever. In fact I'm dropping Galaxies on the 26th of this month."
3,Jump to Light Speed Expansion,"Do not buy this expansion pack. It is now free for anyone that has Star Wars Galaxies. It was originally released as an expansion, but after a year, they made it available for no charge to anyone who hadn't bought it yet."
1,Horrid,SOE ruined the game with the combat upgrade. Don't waste your money. They also have horrible customer service.
4,Game server closeure,"by december SOE is shutting down SWG for good due to the license agreement being pulled from lucas arts. this game is not worth buying at this time due to this. After december the game will be gone and in my personal opinion all products of this game should be removed from the shelves and no longer being sold. its a waste of money at this point. At one time this was one of the best games to play. Customize ur home and decorate it however u wanted, spend ur character points were u want. being a jedi is cool but only when earned and not handed to u on a silver platter. the space content in my opnion was awsome i absolutely loved it. but when the community died off only the true and diehard fans of the game stuck around. great in its time but a waste now with the server closures."
3,This is the only part of the game that is worthwhile,Truly I can say that Jump To LightSpeed is the only part of the new game that is worthwhile soley because it was untouched by the New Game Enhancements. The catch here is that You don't need to buy this anymore. Its been given away as part of the package deal.One great thing is the possibilities of ships and parts you can use. You may see 2 of the same LOOKING ships in space but you can bet that they most likely have different weapons and engines.Unfortunately this piece of SWG is not enough to keep me or the thousands of others in the game.
3,Free now if you buy Galaxies,"Sony has started giving this away to all characters. no need to buy it anymore. of course, not sure what you'd buy Galaxies either. They've nerfed a once great game into the ground..."
1,"Bugs, exploits, and more bugs","Do yourself a favour and avoid this bug ridden game for at least a year. Why a year? By then most of the glaring exploits will be handled.If you want to fly a spaceship in an MMO, try Eve Online. If you want to play in the Star Wars Universe, try any other LucasArts product."
1,Horrid.,This game is dying. Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts have betrayed the fanbase and the Star Wars Franchise 1 too many times.SW:G Japan servers have already shut their doors. SW:G U.S. Servers are well on their way out as well.Don't waste your money!
1,Star Wars Galaxies has been ruined,"I've been playing 4 accounts for almost a year. Star Wars was a whole world experience, where one could do more than simply fight. The latest upgrade has ruined the experience for me. They have changed it into a game like all the other MMPORGs out there. I played Star Wars BECAUSE of the differences. Changing Star Wars into a ""sci-fi"" version of EQ2 or WoW has ruined the enjoyment of the game for me.Do yourself a favor and play WoW or another game if that's how you want to play. SOE has ignored its core user base with these changes. Four accounts cancelled."
1,"Fun start, then back to same old same old","In the Beta I have to say space is beautiful. They did an excellent job with the art and space combat can be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, that fun does not have much longevity. Once you have finished your piloting skill trees you have no new content except PVP. The same problems with the ground PVP game are present in the JTL. As with SWG there is a ton of potential that is not being lived up to.If I had confidence in SOE being able to fix the bugs in JTL, they still haven't fixed some from launch of SWG, and their ability to add content, once again not evident in SWG, it could be a good game. Unfortuantely, the game is lacking, SOE's management of SWG is lacking, and I do not see this as a good purchase. So do plenty of research before buying this expansion."
2,Same Boring Grind.... In Space,"JTLS is the same game that exists on the ground. Non-emmersive, pointless grinding. You can master pilot in ONE WEEK. After that, its just like on the ground. ""What should I do? There's no high-end content."" (besides PvP, which isnt for everyone)Yes, there is a Star Destroyer which is very cool, but the bottom line is that JTLS is not enough to save Star Wars Galaxies. They are far too focused on short-term profits, and fail to realize that the long-term gains of releasing a completed, and mostly bug-free product (like WoW) outweigh the short-term profits of releasing an expansion on an already broken game."
1,Don't be a sucker,"This is just another carrot to steal your money. Don't buy this game because SOE & Lucas Arts does not value their customers.I have been with SWG since release and SOE has lied to me, treated me like crap, and taken my money. I'm trying to help you out, don't get involved with them, also if you are a loyal customer like me, quit! SOE does not care about us, it is obvious now, if they cared they would treat us better. Haden Blackman & Jim Ward can both go to a Turkish prison for all I care.If you don't heed my advice on buying this scam then listen to me on this, just get a monthly subscription. You may enjoy the game for a month, you may enjoy it for 2, but after that you are going to want to quit."
1,Do NOT waste your time or money on this game.,"I got an invitation to play the Beta several weeks ago. And all I have to say is, watch out. This is a horrible expansion and the grinds are just as bad if not worse than the core game SWG.I alway said, if JtLS wasn't any good, I was gonna cancel my SWG accounts. Well, as of 10/7/04, I did just that. Both accounts are cancelled and I'm better off because of it.SWG was bad enough and everyone hoped JtLS was going to save the game. It will not. You will be HIGHLY dissapointed in the grind and the lame ""missions"" the NPC's send you on. It's really very pathetic.I find it to be hilarious yet expected that they plan on releasing this game on 10/26/04 and as of today, 10/8/04 it's a buggy piece of junk. REALLY buggy.So, here's my fair warning, ""YOU WILL GET A BUGGY, BORING AND POINTLESS GAME WHEN YOU PURCHASE THIS"".Just remember, you were warned."
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE,"Please, for your own sake do not start throwing your money to Sony for this crappy game. SWG has been out for over a year now and it should frankly still be in beta. Content is horrible, the game is still buggy (for every 'fix' they break 2 more things...), you will only become addicted to this crappy game and end up throwing 15 buucks a month to them. Also, YOU WILL NEVER BE A JEDI! They advertize jedi, but it will be impossible to even try the padawan trials until you've given them your money for at least 4 months straight. After you get there, it just goes downhill as they continue to break the damn game..."
1,Too bad SOE doesnt care about its customers!,"You would think that a company would take into consideration the thoughts of its players. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the designers of the Star Wars Galaxies team (SOE= Sony Online Entertainment). They will charge you for expansions and then turn around and remove 80% of the professions that you have spent months developing. They do this with NO warning and will not refund money. They do not support the needs and desires of the playing customers. If there were ever an example needed of what not to do with your online customers, SOE could write the book."
1,cu killed swg....cu killed swg....cu killed swg,"swg DOA with 'launch' of cu: 4.26.05RIPSOE, since you and lucasfilm won't listen to fans...WE WON'T PAY TO BETA-TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!ROTW cancelled 1st day of cu.SWG cancelled after giving cu a couple of days."
1,SOE took a good game and made it bad,The comabt upgrade has riuned the SWG gaming experience for all time and I highly reccomend that no one purchases this program. I think my opinion is quite good as I have been playing it for 1.5 years and it is now ruined.
1,Bug Wars Galaxies,"I bought the special edition of SWG because I was so looking forward to a Star Wars MMPORG, I mean how could they ruin that? Boring and Buggy sums it up. Although this expansion sounds nice, why expand when the base is broken? They need to fix that, and I can only imagine that this expansion will add more bugs to the already annoyingly large list. I for one am completely fed up with the software industry expecting people to pay to play their beta games... I don't expect it to be perfect, but SWG is just plain bad. Dissapearing houses, disapearing inventory, broken skills, etc... SORRY. NO MORE!"
3,"Try it. JTL promises to be good, SWG is fun","Ok, I'm a hard core player. Always loved all Star Wars related games. Been playing SWG for almost a year, and I still love the game, yes it does have it's deffects,bugs and stuff, but hey, you have to play it, try it. If you really love Star wars, you're gonna love the game, there is tons of stuff to do, and JTL promises to be fun. It's a huge game, one of it's class. So my advice to you, try it, and make your own conclutions. And have fun!"
3,Geatest Expectation,"Please read this link. This will give you some ideas what's going on in the world of SWG. This shows how they value more their money then the core internal of SWG.JTL is the icing on the cake. The core game is in the ground combat. Everything was pushed back.SWG is a good game, but it's mostly based on hope. A lot of players have envisioned it to be one of the greatest, but it seems the developers don't really care what the customers think (or the people at the high end don't really care forcing them to do things).(...)"
3,Closed Beta,"You are paying for an Closed BETA.Player Vs Player it totaly unbalanced.The galactic Civil War should have beer work on since December and nothing has been done.The battlefields have never been worked on so there is NO big scale conflict.Go out and buy Jedi Accademy at least you dont have to pay every month, the game used to be nice but now it's just a Jedi showoff.I am cancelling my account, a good idea turned to crap."
1,"The game WAS good, but they've gone and Killed it","SWG was the greatest MMORPG I had ever played at first, but not so any more. First, The creators of the game Ignored what the Public wanted. Then, when they showed us what they were planning to do to the game, they ignored the public outcry. And finnaly, when they forced it upon us, they ignored and forcefully suppressed the screams of horror. The Creators of the game have destroyed the features that made SWG stand out and be special and replaced them with a nonfunctional unplayable combat system. Don't buy this game, you'll be wasting your money."
3,Great Customer Servicre!!,"I purchased these boxes for ring that I make and sell at art shows. The outsides were impeccable but unfortunately, the inside tops of the items were stained and dirty. The moment I contacted the seller, they immediately gave me a refund and checked their entire inventory. I would purchase from them again!"
3,"It had great potential, but failed in fairness","The Lost World: Jurassic Park is, in my opinion, a fairly decent game. The graphics are great, as well as the sound. But none of that really matters too much if the game is so difficult you can't even enjoy it! In my experience, this has always been a problem facing games made by Electronic Arts. Honestly, I think Capcom should've been the company to get the Jurassic Park licence. I mean, look at the exellent job they did with the Dino Crisis series. Now that's how this game should've been!So, if you're a fan of Jurassic Park, or you just like dinosaurs, this game might be for you. But please, do yourself a favor, RENT this title first! Don't make the same mistake I did! Or better yet, check out Dino Crisis 2. You will not be dissapointed!"
3,Lost World: Special Edition,"This game has a dremati theatrical score and phenominal graphics, but is otherwise fairly lackluster. Even the easy difficulty seams like the hard on some other Jurrasic Park games I have played. Well thats all I have to say."
3,Rent it first,"Jurassic Park: The Lost World is visually spectacular but it lacks what is most important in the world of video games...gameplay. The controls are limited and you seem to do the same things over and over again. Running around waiting to be snapped up by a bigger, badder dinosaur is frustrating and the fact that the game is 3D but seems to rely on the old side-scrolling schematics is questionable at best. While it is obvious that they spent a good deal of time on the graphics and the outstanding theatrical music score, the game itself ends up being lackluster. Rent it first."
4,some games just never get old,"This is one the gems of the Playstation game library. It'll still play flawlessly on your PS2 (unless you've modified it, then you might run into various loading problems). Simple play system, and a very intersting and funny storyline make Jumping Flash 2 a worthy buy."
1,It's not even made of cloth!,"This costume is made of a paper material similar to a disposable hospital covering. It looks like cloth in the picture, but in person, it doesn't hang like cloth - it is rigid like paper and ugly. Totally cheezy! Sending it back."
1,cheap and not worth the price,the material was cheap and see through. not a good thing for a 9 year old.the horns hurt her head so she didn't wear them and we bought her a longerpitchfork. very disappointed in this outfit.
1,Cheap paper costume,"This costume is SO cheap. It is made out of a paper-type material. Very much like the disposable hospital gowns. In the picture it looks like fabric, but don't be fooled. It is NOT. It hangs terribly and tears apart easily. The horns are cheap foam hot glued to a plastic head band. So, so cheap. Even my 4 year old said it was paper. I am so disappointed. Don't buy this. On the bright side, the seller did ship the item very quickly. If you care."
5,Fantastic Book,"This book is clearly written and has helped me to understand not only my medical conditions better, but it helps to REALLY understand the different medications I am on and some of the ones my Doctor wants to try. It is so much easier to understand all the medical mumbo-jumbo. It is definately worth every penny I spent."
3,Margins a problem for me.,"While excited about ordering the book, I was disappointed by one major factor. The publisher used incredibly narrow margins, and in a volume so thick, it makes this book incredibly tedious to read. I am not stuck by Darwin, but instead by Running Press."
5,the ultimate,"Why would I bother adding another five star review to all of the ones that have already been posted? Because this album is simply that good. It's hands down my favorite Alpha Blondy album, and he is easily one of my favorite artists. His first recordings got me hooked when I was a kid, and I still enjoy every note. This disc goes with me on every road trip."
3,it's not the most classics but good,I hope he could be more quiet at the slow piece of chopin. great techniques though.
4,Strong book but doesn't cover software,"This is a good book, but it doesn't offer much help picking an Internet survey tool, and there are a lot of choose from: perseus.com, raosoft.com, inquisite.com, scantron.com. I would have liked to see some discussion or analysis of the types of tools that could be used."
4,A Fresh Perspective,"It's about bi-s exuality, and Will S. does more than reveal himself in A Letter. He provides a varied perspective on the tangles of human sexuality, using both his own intimate revelations and, more importantly, sources ranging from right brain to left. Philosophers, poets, songwriters, biologists, judo examples and mathematically charterd graphs exemplify the range of his input. The reading flows. The message is both honest and thought provoking. The personal struggle is evident and the mix of subjective and objective perspecitves is unusually fresh and insightful."
3,Classic gameplay,Not a bad game; a good one to add to your retro-game collection. Great remake of a classic. Arcade style gameplay. Compatable with Playstation or Playstation2.
5,good protection,I use these on all the knives in my traveling knife roll. They work great to keep the blades protected from damage and to protect the roll and my hands from the blades. Been using them for years with no issues.
5,Great Treatment to Old Standards,"TRY IT.... YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!KAREN ANGELA MOORE is one of the best ""unknown"" Singers in all of Nashville... and that's saying something because the city is loaded with great singers! She, and her husband Matt, worked tirelessly to record this album and poured their hearts and souls into it... IT SHOWS!!! These are some of the coolest, best mixed, smooth jazz vocals you will hear this year! The presence of the JOHN PIZZARELLI Trio doesn't hurt either! I own four copies because I like it so much and want to give some to friends that haven't heard her yet! Do yourself a favor and buy it here... It's a bargain!"
1,Disappointing,The majority of these games no one has ever heard of. The infoavailable at purchase time does not list what the games are.Very disapointed!
2,Mac users take note!,"As a Mac user, I was very disappointed to find out that these games are not native under MacOS X. It'll be two years in March that OSX was released, and the folks doing Mac development for Hoyle are way behind the curve. It's not going to be sufficient to keep cranking out slightly different Hoyle games each year so long as OSX support is missing.All that aside, the net play is misleading, to say the least. The games in the package do not allow for net play. Rather, it launches a website that has a selection of games, some very different from those in this set. Furthermore, small print on the back of the box again adds disappointment for Mac users - the web site does not allow Mac users to play."
4,NEW VERSION VS OLD VERSION,"I LIKE PLAYING THESE GAMES, THEIR ARE SO MANY TO CHOOSE, THEY ARE FUN, YOU CAN EITHER PLAY BY YOURSELF, OR WITH SOMEONE ELSE, AND THE FACE MAKER IS A BLAST. I CAN ALMOST DUPLICATE A REAL PERSON. ALTHOUGH THEY NEED TO HAVE MORE STYLES FOR HAIR, AND CLOTHES. THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS FROM THE OLDER VERSIONS OF THE GAMES I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDED IN THE NEW VERSIONS, ESPECIALLY JASPER, NITRO & TERRA, ROBIN, AND GAX, THEY WERE THE MOST WITTY, AND SMART MOUTH, FUN TO PLAY AGAINST. WHY DID THEY ELIMINATE THESE CHARACTERS. I THINK THEY SHOULD ADD THOSE CHARACTERS TO ALL THE UPDATED VERSIONS OF THEIR GAMES, WITH WITTY, SMART THINGS. I WOULD DEFINATELY RECCOMEND IT AND BUY IT. THEY SHOULD ALSO MAKE A WAY TO DOWNLOAD UPGRADES ON ALL THEIR GAMES."
1,Rigged games,"The programmers for Sierra Entertainment which produced this game, have a warped sense of ""sadistic"" humor. Many of the games are rigged, especially the backgammon game. The dice does not generate ""random"" numbers, but is coded to ensure the computer ""opponent"" always wins under certain configurations. My advice: Look elsewhere. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK."
1,easy to fix problem,Very disappointed because there was no index of the games included on this disk.
4,Better,I enjoy Hoyle Board Games 2004 better than previous versions. Would recommend it to anyone (if you can find this version anymore).
2,Exciting but not new,"Hardy's Great Braids! contains interesting and easy-to-do styles for medium-to-long hair. What's disappointing, however, is that the styles - and in some cases, the illustrations! - almost completely duplicate Anne Akers Johnson's Hair: A Book of Braiding and Styles (published two years earlier than Hardy's volume). Buy one or the other, but not both."
5,Braids and more,"I bought two braiding books at the same time (the other was Beautiful Braids, by Coen and Maxwell) and this is by far the better of the two. There are upside down and inside out braids, as well as herringbones, twists, and some updos.The book seems to be written to beauty professionals though, since several of the styles are explained in terms of how to do it on someone else's hair, not your own. I'm having a hard time convincing my husband that braiding my hair is a good use of his time. I'm still glad I bought this book, since there are several ideas I hadn't thought of."
3,Hardy loses the plait,"Definitely not what I was expecting from a Thomas Hardy book. I found 'Jude the Obscure' challenging, but this is a new departure altogether. For dedicated fans only."
4,Dupont Disposable Coverall Suit,"This is definitely one of the better disposable hazmat like suits. It is great for use when needing to do mold removal in your home. Many people have flooded basements and sewage backing up into their house because of lost electricity and floods on the east coast. If you want to do your own mold remediation or prevention this is a great suit to do it in. I am 6'7"" and the XXL fits perfectly even over my size 15 shoe. I am very impressed. Do you note it is not breathable material for a reason and it will get hot if it is hot outside."
1,Superficial and too expensive,"Although the world of Special effects is a great topic for a book, this new offering aimed at young readers is dissapointing on many levels. It is way too expensive for what it has to offer, and dwells too much on movies we already know well. If you are looking for a nice book about effects, you will get much more for your money if you choose other books published before."
5,Motogenius indeed,"I'm not actually even finished with the book yet (50 - 60 pages to go) but I had to write in and say that this is an amazing book. It's really good to read about Rossi's detailed feelings about the companies he has won championships for and about companies who he was thinking of moving to and companies that he started off with. He goes into a good amount of detail about the things that mean a lot to him and definitely clears some things up if you might have lingering questions. I'd recommend this to any Rossi fan... then again, if you're a Rossi fan, you should already own this book."
5,King Rossi the writer,"Good book, it is a little fragmented skipping from one thought to another then back to the original thought later in the book, but hey the dood is a motorcycle god not a writer. If you appriciate Rossi and his love for life than you will enjoy hearing his stories. If you are looking for a literary masterpiece move on."
2,Ug. He shouldn't have tried it.,"This book is a LONG read. I don't know if the translation got lost, but it was painful. I don't know if Rossi actually penned the verse, but it comes across as poorly written and not at all thought out.His stories are all over the place, and he tends to say the same thing over and over again, but in different ways.On the plus side, it does help explain a bit about Rossi, and what he's about."
4,Good Racing Autobiography,"This book was much better that I had expected it to be. It was well written and interesting. Some of the stories in the book are hysterical, especially the stories of APE Car racing and the stories of the Honda endurance race. If you are a moto gp fan or even just a fan of motorcycle racing, you should pick this up."
3,decent summer reading,"If you're a fan of Rossi, get it. The book arrived on time and in good shape. Worth reading twice."
3,Good read but needs to be edited better,"I have been a race fan of Rossi since I saw him in the last 500cc championship. It's a great read, but I felt as if the book skipped around too much between time periods, instead of just focusing on just one time. His story isn't told in a linear way from childhood start to MotoGP stardom; rather it begins with his 2004 departure from Honda to Yamaha, jumps to his childhood/teen racing, and then the era right before his MotoGP career. I thought the book structure deserved better editing.It is insightful in that you get many details from his perspective, such as his rivalry with Max Biaggi or how his many feelings on his departure from Honda.Overall, a short book which is good for a day or two of reading."
3,"fun and addictive, but with not much replay, something to break out once in a while","good graphics for the time and genre really, fun to play through a couple times, and though u can use different characters, its still the same gameplay and levels so its more like higher difficulty. addictive in getting perfect score, but so much fun to watch each trigger even if there cheesy. if you like contraptions like the boardgame 'mousetrap' or watching dominoes fall (which is fun just to do around levels with an alien character), and enjoy fast paced puzzles than this games for you"
3,Just an OK title by J. Silk...,"This book seems to be a merge-sort/cut-paste of other books by the same author and by others, too. Not as complete as his own ""Big Bang"" title, wordy, with tints of unconvincing poetical observations that add little to the presentation. OK, it contains sections on dark matter and dark energy etc., but, sorry, the word that keeps coming to my mind is ""unconvincing."" For high-school neophytes, although the lingo gets pretty technical at some places. Not even close to Silk's much more interesting ""The Big Bang"" (3rd ed.).P.S. (10/2011): Today I came across a review of this book in the American Journal of Physics, vol. 75, nr. 1, p. 95-96 (Jan. 2007) by Allan Walstad (University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown). No surprise he did not like the book too..."
5,Everyone should read,"This was a great book. A wake up call for Christians. I believe that she is right on, in her evaluation of the current events of the world. She has a way with words."
2,Didn't seem sincere,"As a follower of Billy Graham's ministry since childhood, this seemed to draw too much on his contributions vs. her own in the ministry of our Lord. Maybe too much name dropping ..."
1,"Total, Raving Lunatic Makes Catholics Look Good","Wow, folks, everything is perspective. I just saw this lady, son of the famous preacher on TV, and she was a total raving lunatic. What we need in the world is a little anti-apocalypticism. She isn't afraid to rave on, about earthquakes meaning the Lord is coming. I wish I had bought that T-Shirt I saw in a Dupont Circle store years ago: ""Jesus is Coming. Look busy!"" Catholics should be happy about people like this. They make them look like relatively reasonable people. It was hard to grow up Catholic. I think it would have been worse to grow-up evangelical. Be thankful for small favors."
1,Please don't read material like this,"The sooner some ""holy"" war wipes humans off the face of this planet, the sooner you can all go to be with your imaginary friend. For those of us who see this whole situation for what it is (blind fear and hate), we can only sit back and watch as the superstitious and ignorant burn the world.As for this specific work, I can only say that it is what many will herald as rock solid proof that the end is coming and god will punish those they don't agree with and reward them for blind devotion.To the author, please stop trying to propagate ignorance, and shame on you for reinforcing false hope in millions of people, though I understand you are also clinging to this false hope."
4,the awakening,I am half way through this book and find it very eye opening. I love Anne's candidness as she writes. It will have you thinking about historical and current events in a way you have never previously thought of them. I wanted to be awakened and this book does that to your soul.
1,Epson perfection v-750,"I was most disapointed with this almost $[...] scanner. It's made of 100% plastic and has no weight to it. I bought it to replace a failing 6 year old Microtek Artixscan 1800f, which must weigh almost twice the Epson. The Epson arrived defective out of the box, small pieces of grey plastic attached to the underside of the glass. I ran a few quick scans with it, and the scans look ok, but the cover for the transparency unit is white, which can cause a small amount of image flare(all other scanners use a black background to avoid this). I did not use the negative scanning unit since I still have a working Microtek which scans negatives and transparencies without having to remove a cover sheet and scan through glass . I am so sorry that Microtek is no longer selling in the US or I would have bought a M-1 from them. Now, there are no other choices availalbe for a pro level scanner except this one or its twin, the V-700"
1,"When I finally get it working, it will probably be wonderful -- BUT!","I'm sure this is a wonderful product. HOWEVER there are NO instructions for adjusting the height of the film holders. ""Adjusters"" are supplied, but not even described. There is not even a suggestion on what size or type Mylar cover is required to hold film in place, or information on the oil requred (both must be purchased separately). They don't even mention that you will also need a cleaner to remove oil from the film. In short, if you buy this and manage to get it working, please drop me a note and tell me how you did it. My previous Epson 4990 is great. This model is a disaster of misinformation."
4,"5 stars for the scanner, 3 stars for the software, not easy to use","I am impressed by the quality of scans the machine is capable of. If it gets fed the right information it performs very nicely, but rather slowly. If you are using it in conjunction with an old computer like mine Digital Ice takes a very long time. You can retouch in Photoshop faster by far. I think the image quality from it is just fine other wise. It is not a ""snap"" to use if you want top quality, but it does have the capability of doing very good scans. I use it for 35mm negs. and slides, 120,220 and 4x5 and some scanning of old photos and small art work. Of course the 4x5 is really nice, but I like what it does with the other formats too. It just takes a lot of patience. It is not a $10,000 machine, but I think it does extremely well for the price. I have had the unit for over a year and have not been disappointed. I'm not crazy about the software though. Probably just not enough user smarts."
3,Verdict is still out but ....,"Recently purchased the V750 after reading all the hype. I was a little disappointed when I discovered the SilverFast Ai pro bundled is 32 bit,my computer system is 64 bit Vista home premium. Epson will not even discuss it. SilverFast reps were very nice saying they may be coming out with a 64 bit verson soon which they will exchange. Also, discovered you can not scan any 21\4 materials so all my Hassalblad files will remain in files."
1,Unreliable Epson V750-M Pro,"After making less than 500 scans over the course of 3 years, I recently noticed that images were skewed...rectangular images were scanning as parallelograms! It was slight, but resulted in useless scans. After a bout with Epson tech support, I brought the scanner to their repair depot, who diagnosed the problem as a bad carriage assembly (this includes all the working parts excluding the plastic case). This is a $450 repair with a 90 day warranty. With Epson boasting a MCBF (mean cycles before failure) of 100,000 scans, I thought my unit should do better than 0.5% before failure but Epson disagreed and refused to fund the repair. Epson should stand behind clearly defective units."
2,No User Manual,"This is a great scanner, BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO A HARD COPY OF THE DETAILED USER MANUAL/GUIDE. So if you have 24/7 internet access to the HTML only guide then fine, as long as you have the time to drill down/through it for what you want. Called Epson support and they confirmed that such a guide does not exist for this $750 scanner. Not even a pdf version, so now I have to download every page, print to pdf, and compile one - that I will publish to the internet when done so others can benefit from Epson's weird documentation support philosophy."
4,Good Commercial Quality Scanner,"I do graphic design and from time to time you need a scanner to get a job done. A normal photo scanner wont do when it needs to be printed on a press. This has super high resolution DPI and scans very fast, even on the maximum DPI setting. All the software that comes with it is nice too. Not really needed if you have photoshop but still nice if you dont. The Text Reader software is handy too. Only used it a couple of times and it has been 100% in reading text perfectly. The only complaint is that it has a small surface area. 9x12 i believe. But for the price, and quality you cant beat it."
2,Dashed Expectations,"We purchased the V750-M as a replacement for an aging scanner. The item arrived in perfect condition. After installing the requisite software and configuring the scanner we were off and running. The scanner made excellent scans while in reflective mode. Color rendering, ease of use, etc. were as expected for a professional grade scanner. Unfortunately the scanner didn't work so well in transparency mode. It acted as if it was scanning but all the scans were scrambled, smeared and completely worthless. We tried it using the Epson software and VueScan with no change. After contacting Epson for advice they finally decided it was an internal problem and we needed to send it in to them for repair. Having just received the item a week earlier we opted to return it and locate another product to fill our needs. Our decision was also predicated on multiple on-line accounts of similar problems with transparency scanning. For a scanner costing over $700 this is totally unacceptable."
3,poor instruction manual,"looks like a well built machine and I expect that good scans can be had. But the online instructions which are necessary to set the options which allow you to get the best out of the machine are terrible. Written by dimwits. The software is full of ambiguous options that do not make sense. It appears that CANON has come out with an even better machine with better ""specs"" , but who knows whether the instructions are any good on that either. If the makers do not bother to publish good clear instructions on how to work the machine properly you will get bad scans from the best machine."
5,Fine piece of equipment!,"This scanner is everything that a person needs to restore old photos, scan new photos. It does everything. One must take the time to read the instructions, can be time consuming, but so worth it! I have been able to restore old family photos to new! Water stains, gone, cracks in photos, gone, fuzzy edges, gone. You will not be disappointed in this purchase!"
2,Foggy glass < 50 scans < 2 yrs,"My scanner got foggy in just over a year. I have barely done 50 scans on it. The result is in softer image after scanning. Basically, useless. Given the price, it is not acceptable. Its a nice scanner but the manufacturing quality is terrible. If you get lucky, I guess it is alright."
5,Excellent Book!,"Can't believe I never heard of this author!!! She ranks right up there with the Bronte sisters et al. I love stories from this period, a classic that I hadn't read before and thoroughly enjoyed!"
3,"Good CDs, but...","I had typed in several artists and songs I had been looking for, and kept being directed back to these CD collections. I LOVE these songs! So I'm picking up this one as well but I wish the contents of the CD (Songs/Artists) had been posted like so many others."
4,Cancelled,"Godawful movie that I was very much looking forward to seeing on DVD, particularly for the director's commentary. Unfortunately, pre-orders were so low that the release has been cancelled. So, in a futile gesture, I will now pre-order it.As for the film itself, so many adjectives apply. Dreamlike, boring, nonsensical, fascinating, impoverished, dull, misguided, spellbinding, asinine, inspirational..."
1,Scream ?,"'Scream' (1981), is supposed to be a slasher or thriller, but I didn't find it very thrilling. This movie is just plain boring. It lacked, in that the suspense lead-ups to the ""scary parts"" were exaggerated to a point where I lost interest, and the gory parts were very quick with minimal viewing.In my own personal opinion, if the viewers were given more clearly graphic scenes to wet their appetites, it might not have been such a bad or boring movie. Sorry, but I rate this movie from 1-10 as 1. ""Awful"". A low budget movie. Though this movie was released in 1982, it is definitely a very 1970's type movie."
5,Very good,I bought this for my pregnant wife. She uses it frequently. It has storage capacity upto 30 for 2 users. I did not see any issues in it.
4,"No AC adapter, cannot use rechargeable battery",Don't know where to get the spec compliant AC adapter. Do not know why this monitor cannot use rechargeable battery.
1,Innacurate,"This device is inaccurate, badly, and therefore a waste of money. It gives ridiculously low readings. I went to ""Consumer Reports"", paid for the report, and got the top nine for Nov 2010, in order, arm monitor ratings. My gift to you.Omron Women's Advanced Elite 7300WOmron Premium HEM-780CVS by Microlife Deluxe AdvancedMicrolife Ultimate 3MC1-PCMicrolife Deluxe Automatic BP3NA1-1XOmron HEM-711ACReliOn HEM-741CREL (Walmart)Panasonic EW 3152HoMedics Automatic BPA-040LifeSource Premium UA-853AC"
4,reliable product,This is the 2nd one I purchased. I purchased one as a X-mas gift in Dec/05 for a family member and they loved it so I got one for me. It works great. I love the memory for 2 people because I can save mine and my husbands B/P's. The only small complaint I have is maybe the cuff could be a little larger since I have large arms but I still get a good B/P .
5,Works great every time,"Just moved out of a stressful job that had my BP significantly higher than my normal. Exercising and eating better now too so I bought the Auto Inflate BP Monitor to track my progress and practice lowering my pulse and BP by concentration. Wonderful tool. Easy to strap on my arm and use. Highly recommend. Good price, fast delivery, excellent value."
2,Not Thrilled,"Bought this for my mother (she has congestive heart failure/high blood pressure)to replace the old one. When compared with the cuff at the doctor's office, it was 25 points higher on the systolic and 8 points lower on the diastolic readings. Hoped we'd get something more accurate than this."
4,easy to use,"Its easy to use but I am not sure about its accuracy, it gives very different reading even if I check my BP twice at the same time. It might dependent how I use it..but overall its good."
4,Muy bueno y preciso,"Hace varios meses compré un Mark of Fitness MF-46 Auto-Inflate Digital Blood Pressure Monitor y estoy muy satisfecho con él; a pesar de usarlo casi a diario para tomar la presión mía y de otra persona todavía conserva las baterías que le puse la primera vez. Las lecturas son bien legibles y precisas, ya que los resultados de la medición son reales y comparables con los que toma el médico en su consultorio. Es muy efectivo si se toma correctamente la lectura y se tienen en cuenta las recomendaciones del fabricante. Sería más completo si mantuviera la fecha y la hora aún cuando se le cambien las baterías, pero éstas se borran y hay que programarlas de nuevo. En lo demás es genial; fácil de usar y a buen precio."
3,The cuff is too small,"That cuff is made for regular people, who often don't have blood pressure problems. The cuff comes off in the middle of a test, and it's really a pain to use. I need help to keep the cuff on to get an accurate reading. I wish I'd looked closer and gotten one with a more comfortable cuff."
1,piece of junk,This item is useless. Readings are inaccurate and frightening if you have high blood pressure already. I purchased this for my husband to monitor his high blood pressure and the readings were all over the place and not once was it accurate. He took it with him on his most recent Dr's visit to ask the Dr. if he was using it correctly and the Dr. said it was a useless piece of junk and to throw it away. Need I say more ? Don't waste your money.
3,useful,"it was really useful but thid digital blood pressure only works with battery, it did not came with adapter for the wall, battery did not life forever"
3,Mark of Fitness Blood Pressure Monitor,"It's fairly easy to use, but the problem may be me and not the monitor since it shows very HBP each time I use it. The reading(s) may be accurate, but I'm not sure."
2,Works part of the time,"This item frequently gives blood pressure readings such as: 195 over 148. But then if you check it with another machine on the other arm it will be a normal blood pressure. So I sent it back because of the five year warranty and they tested it and returned it unchanged and said there was nothing wrong with it.So I had to buy a different brand of machine because at least 50% of the time or more, this one gives bad readings."
5,blood pressure and heart rate monitor,"I ordered this unit because my older Welch/Aylan system stopped showing my pulse rate, just a blank line. Then a few months later it would ""fire up"" and make ""pumping noises"" with full batteries but not inflate the cuff. Decided I really needed to replace it.This arrived ontime, well packaged, and while a bit complicated for an ""old fogey"" like myself to set up for time and date to get started; got it eventually. I have taken a number of checks and it seems consistent with my neighbors manual system, within a point or two and that is normal for anybody, anytime, with any units.Well worth the cost.CCW"
5,ideal book about Ptolemy I,"This study provides great details on this ancient ruler's life. Although he lived part of it in the shadow of Alexander the Great, much is owed to Ptolemy I Soter : the birth of the Hellenistic state, the creation of the Museum, the addition of the Great Library and the Lighthouse to the city of Alexandria, as well as other extraordinary achievements both in and beyond Egypt. Alexandria, his capital, became known as an intellectual center. This book not only tells the story of a leader, but also of his satrapy, his kingship, his family, the wars he fought, and his role during Alexander the Great's reign. With several black and white pictures, it is a recommended biography of interest to students of Greek and Ptolemaic history."
1,Gnostic trip,Not at all happy with the book. Sorry I ordered it. Even the author changed the point of view. Why can't the true story be told?
4,Finally some new Information,"I found this book was very thought provoking. Finally some new information to ponder. If all you want is more of what you already knew, this probably isn't the book for you. The last Gospel in the book gives you a very different slant on things. Wish that we could find more books that give you something other than the same old thing."
2,Gnostic Teachings and Jesus,This is quite a small book re the words and teachings of Christ and it is pretty clear why the early church did not include them in the authorised new testament. Some of the purported things said by Jesus are difficult to grasp in the light of what we have been traditionally taught.For the academic student who wishes a more comprehensive view of Jesus then this book is worth starting with. For the religious student/aspirant however it is too brief and there is little here that is not in the new testament anyway and some of that which is different and out of kilter with traditional teachings.
3,A New Look at Jesus,Very interesting presentaton. It is a translation of texts that you do not find in the Bible.It would have been better presented with some more comments. Good informaton but very dry presentaton for reading.
2,It's an okay book,"This book presents new translations of four early Christian Gnostic texts, which are the Secret Book of James, the Gospel of Thomas, the Book of Thomas, and the Secret Book of John. This is a small book of 129 pages. The Gnostic texts are presented in the front of the book without accompanying explanations. The Notes are listed in the back of the book. These consist of cryptic commentary tightly spaced. This book would have been a more successful read if the commentary was included with each of the gospels. The title is misleading although several of the Gnostic Gospels use the terminology /secret teachings/. You will not find anything secret inside this book. If you are seeking a quick read of Gnostic material, you might consider this book."
5,Enlightening,"There is so much about the past that the Catholic Church has supressed. For those that are turned off by Christianity in general, this is actually, surprisingly something you will enjoy. The Gospel of Thomas went straight to my heart."
3,A PARTIAL FEAST,"Admittedly, I am not a scholar of early spiritual writings but have a passing knowledge of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. I read this book out or curiosity and interest. I was a little dismayed at the freedom of editing but that was not a major detractor to a novice. When I finished the book, however, I had to ask what it meant to me. My conclusion was evasive. The secret might be found in the extensive bibliography. The references, foreign to me, were fascinating. Therefore, I think a companion commentary would have been very helpful. Should I ever read this literature again, I will look for a volume that also includes possible interpretations. As written, I would not recommend this book to those unfamiliar with the subject as it invites confusion."
4,"Good, clear explanations","This book really opened up the world of ADO programming for me. It was concise, but not simple. It really explained the benefits of using ADO. It was insightful, but not too complicated. Not for beginner programmers, though. The format took a little getting used to, but if you read it carefully, this won't be a problem. The CD has code samples, so that is a huge time saver - you wont have to copy the code by hand."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this book hoping to get a good understanding of ADO programming. I have a deep respect for Holzer, and his previous books, but this was a major disappointment.The book is choppy and poorly written. It reads like an appendix in the back of a users manual. With little instruction, the author simply lists the events and methods of the ADO object.This book might be useful as a quick reference, but definitely lacks as a teaching tool.If you are a beginning ADO programmer, I would look elsewhere."
1,It's a manual not a reference Book !,All the topics covered on the book is the same that you can find on MSDN cd's. The ADO coverage is limited by the objects and a few words about it. Worst.
4,A Legend is Born,"This was it, the film that launched Big Bill Smith into B-movie stardom. The first of several biker flics he made, it is, as Joe Bob Briggs in his comentary says, a love story. Rather think of it as a love story where the treats his woman some cheap dirt whore -- come to think of it, she is one. This film will have you enthralled. It has motorcycle stunts, bar fights, gang rapes, the whole nine yards. It also has the fakest moustache ever on film. Sometimes poor Bill could not emote for fear that it would fall off."
1,BAD!,"First off, Run, Angel, Run suffers from a poor quality picture and sound... I mean really bad... almost unwatchable.But if you can get past that you find an amazingly terrible script, poor direction and a story line that alternately confounds in it's implausiblility, and drags in it's drudgery.William Smith's overacting reaches the ridiculous- he may be a world scholar as the commentary points out, but he wasn't smart enough to get out of the way of this train wreck.A few cool looking examples of late sixties choppers, but they're not really on screen long enough to call this a biker movie, if you ask me."
2,Nerdy.,"It's an old, albeit Biker Classic. The viewing, technical aspects aren't very good. Also the jest of the movie is nerdy and unreal."
3,"You ratted-out your brothers - Run, Angel, Run!","Its a biker movie - so don't expect Academy Award winning acting or writing. And there really is a bit of a story. William ""Big Bill"" Smith is ""Angel"" - a biker who sells out his brothers to a journalist to make some big bucks - and his ex-bros ain't happy! Not as many choppers and outlaws as many of these flicks, but still not a bad movie."
1,Hits 60s,"This product was not what I wanted. The songs alternate between a genuine hit from the 60s and something that I had never heard of, and have no interest in. Whoever put this collection together either had poor taste, or is a fraud."
1,No song tracks,"I cannot belive that amazon would offer any music cd for $13.00 plus without at least a list of songs and artists names! What am I supposed to do, send money on a hope that I will like the tracks? Not me,although I am a huge fan of the oldies my nickname is not boo-boo the fool. C'mon amazon stop the nonsense."
1,disappointed,"this movie is good but i bought it because the announcement mentioned english subtitles. In fact, this DVD is only in Spanish language and there is ANY subtitles."
5,"Great People, Great Products","I have enjoyed Cajun Power longer than I can remember. When I was in practice, I would send all of my referrals a package of Cajun Power products.Half of the fun was getting on the phone and talking with the family owned Cajun Power folks in Abbeville, Lousiana. Their products are pure Cajun and I have personally used all of them; especially during duck season. My hunting friends wouldn't go through a season without Cajun Power. If you do not like their products, you do not appreciate the Cajun experience."
5,Jumbo Allen Wrench,Bought for a Christma gift--it was just what was wanted. Impossible to find in stores and I went on line and found them right away. Just perfect!
2,Better out than in--door,"Had this shipped direct to gran'ma & gran'pa's house for use as soon as we arrived off the red-eye. It probably would have been easier first impression had I not been so severely exhausted. Seemed like more trouble than it was worth, shock-cord tubing was more segmented than I thought should be, then the mattress didn't inflate enough for my tastes (for baby to sleep on the floor???)Basically my impression of it: it's a baby tent, made for outdoor use. Didn't seem stable unless the stakes secure the corners (obviously can't be done indoors--unless you have dirt floors). Once all packed up it's pretty compact, and definitely light. A minor disappointment that the mattress doesn't fit into the travel bag with the tent. So actually 2 items to carry.We kept it, but not sure that we'll get any real use from it at all."
2,Not too good!,Did not find any entertainment value in this. Could have included the description on how to color this better and also about how to put in the right quantities of mix to generate lava flow.
3,"Not bad, but it is small","Instructions are easy to follow, I helped my son make his and he painted it up. The only issue is it is pretty small, around 5 - 6"" tall. I was thinking it would be bigger for almost $[...]"
5,Fun,We bought this for my son and he really enjoyed molding the volcano. He also enjoyed painting and watching the volcano erupt.
5,Great,Got this for my son for a science project he had to do - was really fun making and worked great
3,Lumps and bumps,"The volcano kit was not as easy to do as we thought. The form for the volcano came in four pieces and we ended up with empty spaces in the volcano. It is fun to make the volcano erupt, but the building of the volcano was problematic."
3,cool,The boy I bought this for was very excited and as far as I know he loved receiving it. I am not sure if he and his dad have tried it yet!
4,Great Project,I had so much fun making this with my son. The only problem we encountered was a need for more paint when the vinegar and baking soda started to eat the paint off of the mold.
2,Product perils,"We had to run out to the store to purchase vinegar, baking soda and food coloring. There are three formulas for making the eruption materials none of which produced a good enough eruption. The baking soda clogged in the tubes and were difficult to clean afterwards. Very attractive packaging but poor results."
4,Assembly,"We thought we were getting more than we did. Too complex for an almost 5 year old. The 'building' had to have an adult involved. The painting of the interior is difficult as the 'volcano' is not smooth. Again, needs an older child with a larger brush than provided. When the final results were at hand, one idea would have been to somehow add food coloring or something to make the 'lava' red. Just white wasn't as fun. Overall, interesting and probably a one-time only event."
1,cheap,Okay. I'll review it. Not worth it. Kids were bored with it. But how do you return a USED volcano? you don't.
3,Okay Product,"This is obviously educational but didn't keep my kids interest very long. Also you can't use it the same day you assemble it. You need to let it dry before use. The ""eruption"" wasn't very exciting and was more like a small spill. Only used once."
3,OK at best.....,"I guess you have to consider the low cost of this kit....however, I was expecting more. The ""eruption"" is more like a 3 sec bubble. Not great in our opinion (ages 40, 39, 11, 9). The exact quote from my 9 yr old (with LOADS of sarcasm)...""Wow! That was really great""."
3,Wainscott Kid Review,"The Kids Lab Volcano kit is awesome, because the vinegar and baking soda made it kinda explode with fizzy bubbles. Use food coloring and baking sprinkles during the eruption. It was very easy to put together. It was safe and fun."
1,Directions are terrible.,"Not only did I end up throwing everything away after 10 minutes, but I got the whole kitchen dirty with plaster, a good spoon covered in plaster, and threw away a good bowl covered in plaster. They warn you lots about painting, but say almost nothing about the mess about working with plaster.I measured 280ml of water per instructions and the paste was too thick. I tried thinning it with water but it was too late. It was hardening very quickly. I tried pouring it as is but was too thick. Got plaster everywhere. Forgot that it can't go down the drain and got the sink clogged up. Good thing for Draino, which cleared it up.This product isn't what I thought it would be either. I thought they would provide some chemicals, but they just provide the mold making materials. Go get vinegar and baking soda yourself."
3,Project,Have not opened it yet but I bet the paint will be fun to work with just hope it's some good paint not some water paint that will run when applied.
5,Great fun and easy to assemble,"This was fun to assemble and quick too. My 5 year old son enjoyed the experience and wanted to take it to school to share with his environmental club. I like the fact that you can use the model over and over again. Well worth the price.DeniseKingston, Jamaica"
3,Smaller than I expected.,"We (2 adults) had a ball making this! The mold was fun, we were kind of nervous that it would actually harden! That's just because we were really excited & anxious to put the baking soda/vinegar in! We set up the little cut-out photos & recorded it... but it was kind of silly lol, I don't know if the measurements were a little off or what, but it didn't give us the BOOM like the illustration on the cover of the box. But I wasn't expecting that. :) It was a good time! I loved painting it! It was tiny, but it fit in my suitcase (the box) & we loved the experience. Good Christmas present!"
1,not good!,not what i expected.... does not look like the picture when flames go up.... save your money.... my kids did not enjoy it at all...
5,Cool volcano,This volcano kit is really cool. I even enjoyed doing it. Gets a little messy but that's the fun part. My son loves this.
5,This is for you!!,"This is by far the greatest 15 minutes ever compiled onto one tape. When I listen to Judas Priest, I imagine myself cutting class, driving in an El Camino with my friend ""Trip,"" complaining about our parents and teachers. This video turns fantasy into reality. If you ever were a burnout Priest fan, this is for you. If you ever wanted to be a burnout Priest fan, this is for you. If you just like lauging at burnout Priest fans, this is for you. If you simply like to laugh, this is for you. I cannot imagine a single open-minded person not enjoying this beautiful film."
3,20 Minute Joke Film: Expanded!,"It is amazing that the makers of the film were able to fill a DVD with extras for a 20 minute film, but it is very entertaining.The film itself is classic and shows the stupidity of youth. But the extras really add a more complete experience. Favorites include:-""Neil Diamond Parking Lot"" is a perfect juxtaposition of the battiness of age VS. the stupidity of youth, just silly interviews with old folks at a Neil Diamond concert.-The follow-up segment with the ""Stars"" of Heavy Metal Parking Lot is a satisfying experience as well. The disbelief and transformation of ""Zebra-Man"" is the best part.-""Harry Potter Parking Lot"" shows the modern day hysteria and the Naivete of childhood VS. the stupidity of youth VS. the battiness of age.A fun DVD overall."
1,I mistakenly got the VHS when I wanted the DVD. my bad.,I don't have a VHS and I don't know anyone who does. don't make the same mistake I did.
5,Funniest Documentary ever,I watch this over and over and over. Lots of wonderfulI watch this over and over and over! Lots of extras and I find something new every time I view this.
5,This movie is a time machine to the 1980's!,"Big hair and spandex! This movie from 1986 is about a bunch of heavy metal loving kids waiting in the parking lot of Capital Centre for Judas Priest to play.. It is absolutely hilarious! The special features go back to some of the kids years later and show you ""where they are now"" type footage. This is difficult to find! I was thrilled to find it inexpensively and in great condition!"
5,tried to get a heavy way,I need this movie. and amazon is not able to send it to germany.is there any person who would be so kind?thanks.stephanvens@thp.biz
2,mildly amusing,"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Yes, it is a cool slice of life from that era, but frankly I have taken better stuff at simalar events and I'm not a pro... Don't get me wrong, it was pretty cool, but it could have been better."
4,Heavy Metal Parking lot,I have seen this a couple times before. I finally had to purchase it and add it to my collection. It was such a flashback but so true of the time. That could have been any Heavy Metal lot at any venue across America at that time. My only complaint is it could have been longer. I'm sure there could have been an hour or better footage. Al in all i would recommend it to everyone..
5,I was there!,"Amy here. Some of you know who I am. Those were the good ole days. Yes......I am alive and well, and so are my friends. So great to see a video of all the fans, including myself. More videos like this should be made to show the reality of how it was at all the great concerts. Rock on!"
5,What a recording,"Mystic,eternal, and meditative is how I woulddescribe these chants, a most perfect giftfor Christmas. This reissue sounds even betterthan the ones released in the mid 90's.I would highly recommend this recording to anyone.The only rule is sit down, or lay back and enjoy."
4,"Hey Furby, how do I open the battery compartment?","Darling toy, very pleased until I tried to change the batteries and found that NONE of our philips screwdrivers could do it. They need to change this triangular screw top, and just use an average one. It was frustrating and I will have to walk Furby into home depot and ask them what in the world it takes to change the batteries.. Now, mind you, I grew up with tools, my grandfather handmade some of his own beautiful tools and my husband owns a salvage and auto repair shop..TOOL TIME!! I can't find the tool for this!Hey Furby, change your won batteries.."
2,"""Alive"" is brain dead!","This movie started off interesting enough. A man murders the gang that raped his girlfriend and is placed in the electric chair. When the voltage fails to kill him, he is given the option to live or to be fried again. He chooses life. Enter storyline #2. He is put into what seems to be a ""Cube"" type experiment: locked in a metal room with a psychotic man who claims to have also escaped The Chair. It appears some government scientists are testing how long it will take these two to kill each other. But that's not it. Enter storyline #3. A beautiful woman appears to the men. It seems she is the host for an alien entity that her father contracted from eating a baboon that visited a spaceship in the jungle (Oh, how I wish I were making that up!). The remainder of the film is a mess of Hell images, Kung-fu showdowns with cloned super-soldiers, and random shootings that make no earthly sense. Someone should have read the script for ""Alive"" and pronounced this film D.O.A. instead."
3,a promising start but...,it went nowhere after that. it had decent special fx but the story was so so..Could have been better..
2,expected more!,"The film has action and violence, (very japanese style), but the story goes from good to weird, i really expected more, yet is good for japanese movies fans"
2,"RYUHEI KITAMURA, OPUS 2","** 2002. Written and directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Based on a comic book. Tenshu Yashiro, after having been condemned to the electric chair, is given a second chance to live. He's locked in a room with another prisoner and their reactions are observed by scientists. Although the first 15 minutes are interesting because we don't know what the movie is really about, ALIVE disappoints very quickly. The director mixes an alien entity, weird flashbacks that don't bring anything to the storyline, mean politicians who don't hesitate to slaughter nice scientists and so on. Ryuhei Kitamira doesn't have anything to say to his audience. Already forgotten."
2,Huh???? what happened!!!,... this movie started out with an interesting story but falls apart after the girl is introduced as stated by the previous reviewer. Very good start but falls to pieces by the end. On the positive side the effects are amazing. Blows away anything you'll see in any Matrix film. The cinematography is also top notch! With a strong enough plot this would have made an amazing movie.
2,Not so good,Hard to read and pretty verbose which makes it hard to find things again. Contains some mistakes.
3,Needs editorial work,"There is a lot of information here but it appears that the author did alot of cut and paste. The exact same information will appear just a few pages later many times. And I am not talking about protocols or data, the narrative is duplicated. There are also alot of typos and some factual errors (not relating to ss7 as I am in no position to judge, but there errors in the historical narrative) I wish that the third edition had been available when I bought it. I doubt that I will buy it just to find out if the same problems exist, but one would hope that these problems have been addressed. I cannot believe that an editor actually read this book."
5,One of the best technical books I've read.,"This book give a clear concise description of the protocol and its applications. It is very readable to the person that is relatively new to the topic, yet full of helpful information for the more experienced."
2,Signalling System #7,Verbose. Repetitive. Covers basics. Going thru ITU specs is complicated and this book is not exactly helpful.
1,An attempt at an SS7 Book,"This book is so badly written and contains so many errors that you are better off reading what you can find on the web, and once that is grasped, reading the specs. Do not expect to become an expert on SS7 with this book - it is hard to read, and as said contains major errors."
4,An Excellent 2nd book on SS7,"This book might be a little heavy as an intro to SS7 (See Uyless Black's ""ISDN & SS7"" for that), but it's a great 2nd book; a book to get after you've got the basic concepts and now need to go into the details. It's got a tremendous amount of detail, and is a lot easier to deal with than the Specs."
2,Review of Chapter 5,"I can really only comment on chapter 5, which covers MTP2. I thought that chapter was poorly organized. It contains errors, and even outright contradictions from one section to the next."
2,"The answers are there, if you can find them.","If you need a book on SS7, this is probably the one you should buy. But that is only because there is little else to choose from. Unfortunately, it is a very poorly written book. Russell obviously knows his stuff, but like most other telecommunications engineers he seems unable to write in a form that gives the reader any pleasure. Facts repeat themselves (often several times in the same paragraph), different chapters repeat the same thing in several different ways, and there is rarely much explanation for WHY things are done the way they are. What's worse is the pointless verbosity of the whole mess - it's almost impossible to find an answer to a question about SS7 quicky. I think the author has done a fine job putting the facts down, but the editors never did their jobs. This book reads like a first draft that was never ever reviewed."
1,Expensive door-stop,"This is quite possibly the most badly written book I have ever read. All the concepts and details are in there - but, just like Prego, there's no particular order or discernable logic to it. At least with Prego, you can get something to eat out of the deal..Russell's book introduces ideas and concepts before they're defined, repeats definitions, and generally just meanders around. And, for the nit-picky, the grammar is sloppy as well.Anybody wishing to learn about SS7 would be better off searching the internet and reading the SS7 tutorials found there. I'm using my copy as a $69.00 door-stop."
1,"Poorly written, poorly organized","This is the only widely available book that covers SS7 is great detail. Unfortuntely, the writing is terrible and the organization is worse. Russel goes off on many pointless digressions and replicates material in almost every chapter. It is very hard to get a good idea of how SS7 actually works from this book, as few real-life examples are given. However, it isn't a bad place to start if you want to learn about SS7 from scratch. Then, once you understand the basics, do find another resource such as the standards to go to."
1,Poorly organized; inaccuarate in places,"Russell's rambling style makes easy reading for beginners, but I found this book to be virtually useless as a technical resource; it's difficult to find the piece of information you're looking for because the text jumps from one topic to another according to the author's train of thought at the time. I have some experience with SS7 and had hoped this book would fill in the areas where I was weak, but I discovered that the book is actually incorrect in its explanation of some topics (e.g. Changeover) and so Russell can't be trusted - you'll end up reading the actual standards if you want an accurate description of SS7."
3,so - so,"A period piece set in 1909 London. Tranby has shut herself off from love andlife because she is scarred from the death of her `love', Jonnie, a girl sheknew for about 12 hours when they were both 12 years old. Jonnie kissed her onceand was found drowned the next morning.At age 34 Tranby meets and falls in love with Lysette, a beautiful 19 year oldwith an abusive husband. They do the one step forward, two steps back dance,fearing Lysette's husband, worrying about Tranby's teaching position and fearingsociety and the shame of being `inverts'. The story is slow and depressing as itplods along to an unexpected but pleasantly surprising happy ending.Tranby's journal entries which are fanciful, adventure stories and ""Dear Lysetteletters"" take over much of the book. I found them rambling and distracting andusually skimmed them quickly so I could get back to the real story."
5,A great book about a great theory.,"Gaia is one of the most profound theories of the 20th century; the theory veiws the earth as a living organism with the ability to regulate the climate so it is comfortable for life.Lovelock does a great job of expaining this theory in terms undestandable to anyone with a basic scientific education. the book is written from the point of veiw of a plenetary physician, this top down perspective really adds to the books charm. He includes case notes providing real cases of planetary ailments. There are sections on the anatomy, physiology and plagues of our earth.This book is a refeshing escape from the usual reductionism of science, and a great treatment of the pressing issues concering our evironment."
3,Jim,I have enjoyed the play of the racquet EXCEPT for how delicate it is on it's edges. Just touch it and it blisters. I will continue play with it but will not purchase another one for that reason.
3,Good racket,"For average player use only. Comfortable grip. Good control. I am unable to get a go spin on the ball. Surface is not tacky like the more expensive one. I use it when during my table tennis club. I am only an average player. This racket/paddle didn't improve my game. It actually made it worse, at first. Got used to it, better now; still loose games but only by few points now."
5,I become a winner,"This racket is so awesome and makes me a winner. In particular, its spinability is unbelievable."
3,It's a ping pong paddle. What do you expect?,"Without question, this is a giant step up from the 2 for $10 set my wife bought for the kids. Aside from that, if I were good enough to tell the difference, I'm sure I'd want a much higher-end product. Since I'm not that good, this is certainly a decent ""racquet"" for the price."
5,very nice,"I went from a cheap paddle to this and I did not expect to feel this much different.I play quite a bit of ping pong, and I'm not too bad. I would not say I am good compared to many of the tournament players, etc, but I usually will beat the people around me and can compete in the ping pong tournaments. I think the next tournament I go to, I will have more of advantage since I have this new paddle.The spin and power generated from this paddles is a little tough to get used to right at first, but once I got used to it, I couldn't imagine going back.I did a lot of research on which paddle to get, and I think I got a really good price to quality ratio and to get a paddle that is too much better you would have to not get a prebuilt paddle."
4,Good speed and spin,"I liked it but only after a practicing a while. This has got a very good speed and spin.... And as mentioned in the specs, control is one thing you need to get comfortable with. Its a little heavy paddle as compared to others but that helps in getting more speed to the shots. So use it for a while and you would start liking it... It might give ur game an edge over others. Ideal for medium level players."
3,"Great spin, but falls apart too easily","This is a nice first racket and you can easily get some very good spin with it due to the handle and sticky flextra grip. Although due to the relatively cheap design, the racket rubber fell apart too easily and would not recommend this racket since cheaper Butterfly rackets lasted longer."
3,Heaver than thought,"Nice racket, but I find the weight of the paddle a little restricting. Also, spin isn't any easier to execute as other cheaper rackets. On a plus note the racket corrects your form, so it rewards correct technique, rather than letting you get away with sloppy play. Good for beginners to intermediate IMO."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"I would consider myself an intermediate player and have been using a co-worker's Yasaka Mark IV paddle. It was a good racket and wanted to buy something similar with the same speed, spin, and control rating. I thought that it would be close, but it is not. Maybe I'm just not used to it yet, but I played 10 games in one day and still can't get the hang of it. Ball sounds flat coming off the paddle and the speed / spin does not come close to the Yasaka. It's too light and the grip is fits small in your hand. Felt the same as my old $15 butterfly. I allowed some of my friends who are really good and some actually compete and they say that it is not worth $50."
2,simply didnt like it,"not much to say!!! i just did not like the feel and coverup for my clubs, i should have gone a little further and spent some more!"
3,"Great for protecting club, but don't last long","These covers made by Wilson come with covers for the SW, PW and irons 3-9. They are soft and slide on easily and protect your irons when they are on the back of the cart and bumps are hit. The only problem is that less than 3 months into the golf season, they have started to rip and are starting to become more of a hassle then a benefit. Overall, they were good while they last and for around 10 bucks, I can see myself buying a replacement set."
3,"Nice, once they are on.","The look of these covers is nice once i finally get them on. Getting these covers onto my clubs is a bit of a pain, especially compared to the old ones i used. They are very tight, and on a few clubs required enlarging the opening a bit to make my taylor made's to fit at all.I dont think they are bad for the price, but they are a little annoying to get on and off for my taste."
2,Wilson Golf Neoprene Iron Covers,"I was disappointed with these covers. From the description I thought they would easily cover my irons but that wasn't so. Maybe my irons are a little bigger but regardless, I was disappointed."
2,Hard to give them 2 stars,These are cheap and of poor quality. The head-cover's on the irons I use most have long ago met there maker. I would not recommend this product. Spend a couple of more $$$ and buy something that will last.
3,Decent for the price...,"Covers do their job, but are a bit difficult to get off the irons. Already ripped the 5 iron cover...was being careful when taking it off, but ripped anyway (although it will still be functional). Not a bad product for the price, but would be nice for them to 'slip' off a bit easier. If you're looking for a cheap means to protect your irons, these will do."
3,Tight fitting but thin,"You get what you pay for. These covers are well fitting but a tight fit. A bit challenging to get on but they will stay on and not fall off. One of the covers is already splitting after 2 months use, so you get what you pay for but they work in a pinch."
5,Neoprene Iron Covers,If you are into protecting your irons these Wilson covers do an excellent job plus they look great. The ease of putting them on and taking them off adds to the excellence of the product. Very good purchase - pricewise and quality.
2,A little scary for the younger crowd,"I would have to agree with the other reviewer. It is not a game for kids under 10... I purchased it for my 7-8 yr olds and they freaked out as the first scene played out. The controls have to be tight, and whatever you do don't make a mistake. After trying it out myself, I kind of felt like throwing the controller down. One misstep and I had to start over. Oh well. Maybe the 10 yr olds have a better chance than I do!"
4,about the game,When i played this game i though that it was stupet but when i had leard what to do then i had started to enjoy it the game is hard and you have to figure out what to do and how to do it the game is just like a puzzle so that makes it more difficult to play the game.
1,Awful,"i dont see what the awsomeness was in this game that the other reviewers did, but i think it was awful. i liked the opening scene, it was cute, but rite when i started playing it, im like, dude! this is horrible! it is like, impossiible to get those annoying little demons off of your character, and i agree with that other reviewer that if you make one wrong step, your dead and have to start again. its awful, i highly advize against buying this game before renting it."
4,Catch all the 3 Versions in a Book,"Decide to buy this book because it serves as a guide to all 3 versions of the Pokemon game (Red, Blue, and Yellow). Though it primarily focuses on the Yellow version, it doesn't lack telling one what he could expect and the differences in the other two.The Pokedex provided inside is pretty cool too. Besides having a full listing of all the Pokemons, their types, and their learned skills at different levels, it also shows the locations where they could be found, and the TMs they could learn (something quite different from the guide books of Red and Blue).Personally, I find the big 'tear-out' poster map attached at the back, plus the 2-pages rough outlines of what one needs to achieve at the different towns a very useful quick guide to start the game with.A worthwhile book if you have yet owned any Red and Blue guides. Else, you might find many contents repeated, though you may still buy it for the poster map and comprehensive Pokedex."
2,Not much,"This is more like an extension of the manuals walkthrough than a very in depth guide. The layout can be confusing as well not always knowing what dialog box is referring to what map. This may be the best guide there is, but it's not very good. It may add more to someone already familiar to the game but for a newbie looking for some help, and basic information such as which Pokemon show up only once or what each HM does exactly, the Web is proablly a better resource."
5,A great help for Pokemaniacs.,"This guide is for help with Pokemon Yellow but not only that,it can be use for both Red and Blue!I love the detailed information,especialy on TMs HMs and evolutions in the back."
4,Very helpful,Very helpful indeed. The pictures weren't so great but I got through the game fine. In record time I might add.
4,fun game! [and ps2 compatible],"Although the graphics look like the Matrox Mystiqe PC 3d- accelarated version of MW2. it is fun, i have not played it, but i have seen some trialers of gameplay, so it looks like it is worth to buy. Plus one more thing to people who have a PS2, this game is PS2 compatible if you ever knew.This game would be worth to but indeed"
1,Don't know...couldn't play it,"I baught this for my husband for his birthday. The seller was very promt, however when the disc arrived and he attempted to play it, it would only go as far as the start up screen and would go no further, bad disc."
1,Misleading as to size,"I will be traveling to Brazil with my diabetic 16 pound cat. I read the reviews over and over because I was afraid my cat wouldn't fit in it. The 18 inches long includes the wheels. The real lengh is 16. There is no way my 16 pound cat would fit comfortably in there. Only if she were smashed during the 15 hours trip. Since it's said here that it will carry a 22 pounds animal, I decided to buy it. I guess my husband will use it as a backpack now... and we'll have to buy another carrier for the trip."
5,Nice little dog carrier,"My pet has flown in this carrier about 30 times. With any dog carrier I suggest you sit in the middle seat in Coach, which is the widest. The window seat in Coach has least space width-wise because it is curved. The aisle seat is also smaller than the middle and may cause too many distractions with everyone walking by, or someone might walk into the carrier and hurt your pet. Of course there is always more room for any carrier in First Class."
2,smaller than described,This carrier is described as being large enough for a pet up to 22lb. What a joke! My 5lb Chihuahua is cramped and uncomfortable. My smallest cat is 8lb and she would never be able to be stuffed into it!!
2,way too small for 6 lb dog,my 6lb puppy couldn't even fit in this comfortably. i guess she's more long than tall so she looks like a sardine when sitting in this bag. it's also awkward when you roll the bag because she falls back and it's so uncomfortable that she's always squirming to get in a stable position.
3,PEt carrier,Like the carrier but advertised to hold 22 lb and only hold much smaller animal. Lucky my cat is smaller.
5,Pet JCarrier on Wheels,My Cat's name is Teddy Bear and he loves to be going on trips to the store while I either roll or carry the Deluxe Backpack. While I have the closet open he tends to think we are going out and tries to get into the bag. I love the size and it's functionalty of the wheels to roll him around.
3,Backpack Pet carrier,"I liked the case. My dog hated the case, it was too easy for him to get out of. I finally just gave it awyay to someone who had a puppy. They needed a place to put him to keep for stepping on him."
3,poor customer service,"I was very disappointed in the customer service I received.After the backpack came, some of the items on the tag were not included with the product.I called the phone number to get help and a man called ""Sam"" eventually returned my call.I never got the missing parts promised on the tag and Sam stopped returning my calls all together!I need the backpack to travel w/my pet or I would have just returned the whole thing.Decent customer service could have made this purchase worthwhile.Instead, I am reluctant to order again."
3,"My dog fits, but it is a little small.","My 15 pound boston terrier fits in it, but there isn't much extra room. We're not using it for long travels, just biking. I wouldn't want him in it for extended periods, but it looks like it will do the job for our needs."
2,Dangerous,"The product has two loose wires on the inside, meant to be repositioned so that they keep the carriers shape. HOWEVER, the wires do not stay where they are supposed to and they are completely exposed to the animal on the inside. So god forbid one gets loose (which is highly likely), then there is a loose wire hanging around inside the carrier with your dog. And the wire itself is thick metal. I returned it immediately as I could easily see this going real bad real quick."
4,"Targeted for high-caliber, self-motivated player","A really good book for a select audience. For younger players or those not motivated enough to focus their energy and effort at this level, I highly recommend the two companion VHS tapes on offense and defense/rebounding. However, if you are a middle or high-school player who really wants to raise your game, you can't go wrong here."
2,best of the bunch... but that ain't saying much,"Hakim Bey is the best of the lifestyle oriented anarchist writers. His ideas are clear (or at least clearer than many others) and his writing style is attractive. Too bad his ideas are so silly.I'm all for parties, and the creation of temporary zones of fulfilment (which is what this book is calling for) but they aren't going to feed the starving or clothe the poor. Anarchist need to be thinking deeper and more concretely than this if they're going to make any real change."
1,Most likely COINTELPRO,"Hakim Bey/Peter Lamborn Wilson is most likely COINTELPRO-if not literally at least metaphorically. I highly recommend looking at John Zerzan's reaming of this con artist in Running on Emptiness. For gullible wannabe anarchists, beware-you will be indoctrinated into becoming apathetic, self centered/indulgent and rendered quite useless if you subscribe to any of Bey's ideas."
1,Ant titanium,"Well i have a nickel allergy so I got this belt because it says its made out of titanium. Well its not. Once you wear thru the plastic protective coating its really a nickel plated steal belt. Joy red spots...To prove its not really titanium i took a magnet to it and it sucked it right up. Titanium is not magnetic in any shape or form. And its not just the steal set screws, the buckle and the loop both can be picked up with a magnet.If your allergic to a stainless steal watch, you will be allergic to this."
1,POOR QUALITY,"The layers of this belt not only separated longitudinally, but the buckle lost one of its screws and almost lost both! I tried to have it repaired, but they said it would not be worth the repair charge!I am of normal...slender build (e.g. no major 'beer belly') and this product failure could not be attributable to that factor.Good idea, & a strong need exists in the marketplace to address the hassle factor of having to remove your belt to get through airport ""Security??"" multiple times per week, but you must address quality issues with materials and workmanship immediately! Perhaps use real leather, and implement a buckle fixation system that works! Also...an even better material to consider would be a completely non-metalic composite. This titanium still triggers the metal detectors in airports that crank up their machines to the ""Nuke"" level!!RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM AS-IS!!!!"
3,Decent belt but lacks something,Bought this for my fiance and he wears it every so often. I think it's too stiff for him. I really liked the reversible belt feature but it would be nice if he wore it more often. Maybe he needs time to break it in but he's owned it for about a year now.
2,Same problems,The leather layers came apart. The screw of the buckle popped out and was lost. I didn't have an allergic reaction to this belt while it lasted.
2,"Poor Construction, Questionable buckle","This belt while attractive, does have an issue with the screws backing out and the buckle coming loose. A quick fix is to remove the screws and put some Loctite on the threads and re insert the screws. Problem fixed. Although the problem should not have been there in the first place.The biggest problem that I have with the belt is that it claims to have a titanium buckle. Titanium has always been okay with my nickel allergy. But this ""titanium"" buckle has too much nickel in it and caused a severe reaction after wearing for a period of time. I used a nickel testing kit and it showed high amounts of nickel in it. Interesting when titanium is supposed to have the lowest concentration of nickel in it. A concentration so low that it does not leach out. If you have an allery to nickle stay away from this buckle. I cannot use this belt anymore."
3,A Simple introduction to the history of Opium trade w/interviews,"The book is good as an introduction to opium use for the novice, who know nothing about the subject. The beginning chapters speak of the history and trade. The middle chapters are interesting, filled with question & answer interviews and poetry. However, they occupy way too much space in this book.The remaining chapters explain the ""how to"", which is factual and seems to be from personal experience.In my opinion ONLY, the book doesn't remind me of a Chinese author/scholar, but more of an American writing on the subject, one who certainly does have the knowledge and experience to do so.Summed up, it is a decent book for a reader's initiation to the subject of opium."
5,"Good quality, fast shipping","Bought this for my husband and it fits nice, sizes run pretty true...great price and fast shipping. Bought the red and the blue for him."
2,Beware applying optimal f to actual trading,"The problem with optimal f is that the calculation is highly dependent on the largest loss on a trade (not drawdown) experienced in backtesting. If you use optimal f and the largest loss in actual trading is greater than the loss experienced in backtesting, you will go bankrupt. Vince deals with this problem in an offhanded manner by suggesting that the actual f you use should be ""padded"". OK, so in the end you don't even use the actual optimal f, you pad it. And how much do I pad it by? Vince is silent on this question. So the purpose of optimal f - to decide by formula how much capital to allocate to a trade - is totally negated by the fact that you must ""pad"" optimal f. And you must pad it by a qualitativly determined amount because, again, Vince gives no formula on how much to pad it by. Optimal f is totally useless for system traders or any other trader for that matter."
5,Wonderful,"This aquarium is wonderful. It has very soothing music and you can change volume - 3 levels. The light is not too bright so our child can fall asleep easily without turning it off. The remote control is also useful, especially if the baby turns it on while sleeping. Batteries also last for some time. We use the aquarium every day for bed time and so far we only change the batteries after one month of use."
2,Ocean wonders,"I , purchased this item for a 100.00 dollars and was very dissappointed, however the company did compensate me half of my money back which I, was very pleased with that!!However this seems like an outstanding product for babies, but my volume on mine is very very very faint!!! I could have returned it completely for a refund but I, chose to keep it because I, fell in love with it, I, decided I, could live with the faintness of the volume!!!!!!"
1,Pretty good... (UPDATE!),"HAD to have this for my son. It's a great distraction for while we're diaper or clothes changing. Cute toy, and easy for him to turn on and off. Love having the remote for it also. I play the music for him at bedtime. It definitely eats up the batteries if you use it with lights, music, and ""swimming""...but that was expected I guess... Would recommend!!!!UPDATE!!!So a couple months into using this, it REALLY DID EAT UP THE BATTERIES! Battery acid leaked all into the battery compartment, so I was definitely not going to put it back in my sons crib. Very scary and disappointing! :("
2,Will last for about a year,"We bought one of these for our little one, and while she enjoyed it lot, the ""water"" level was lower than the fish swimming in it. A baby would probably not care, but as a logical adult, it always bothered me to look at it.Over the time the ""water"" level just kept dropping and by the way, it is a sealed item with no way to re-fill it (without expertise in disassembly & access to a tube cutter, glue gun and syringe. We kept it anyway for our next child and when we took it out of storage the water was 2/3 of the way down.Overall, my advice is that it will be okay for a year. For the price though I want a toy I can pass along to a younger sibling a few years later. This is not one of those. Maybe that's why it's discontinued?"
4,Great Soother!! Remote is awesome!!,"Aside from the scratches on the front that were there when we received the product the Aquarium seems durable to normal wear and tear, which have included being yanked on and hit by our toddler. It attachés to the crib securely.The remote is great, but it would be even better if it had an option to turn the volume up and down also. That's the only reason I rated this Four Stars. We haven't had an issue with the remote at all, other than wishing it had volume contol.This has been a great crib ""soother"" and does exactly that for our son. I really like that is has different options and volume control on the unit.I also really like that there is a big push button on the front of it that enables the baby/toddler to turn it on and off themselves. We've found that on more than one occasion upon waking from a nap our son has pushed the button and we find him sitting in his crib, watching it."
3,Loud Clicking Sound,"This toy is very soothing, as the other reviews say, and it has wonderful lights and sounds. It also, however, has this loud, annoying, clicking sound every time the fish flaps its tail. The clicking sound is louder than the music, so it kind of ruins the toy."
1,emae,"We must have bought a defective one because I'll tell you, this thing was a problem from the get go. The movement of the fish and plants caused a very loud and annoying clicking sound and replacing the batteries is a pain. Despite all this we kept it for the music and now 7 months later, the water has evaporated so the fish looks as if it's swimming in a shallow pond. If you're a busy mom who doesn't have time to hunt down your sales reciepts and drive all the way back to the store to return things, don't buy one of these."
4,Amazon is NOT the cheapest!,The old fisher price aquarium without the remote is nice and not as flimsy hooking to the crib. This one though has a better picture and the remote. It is much cheaper through other site like Target and Wal mart so beware. The old aquarium is also on sale here for 98 dollars!!!! HUH? The new one is 37 dollars through target.
1,Looses water...,"Our aquarium has lost more than 1/2 the water... Unfortunately, Fisher-Price does not uphold to the standards I once thought the company did. They will not replace the item, it's too bad. Do NOT buy, Fisher-Price lacks quality control and does NOT stand behind their product."
3,Wanted to love it - was disappointed!,"Well, I researched and researched, and looked forward to this toy. We had to replace our son's crib toy as the machinery became noisy, and settled with this one for our second child. I love the sounds and the bubbles and fish are captivating. One problem - this thing is too darn BRIGHT! I wish the light could be turned down to a softer glow. When I put this on, my child's eyes are like saucers! Back to the drawing board! It is also not sound activated which is a shame too."
3,Very disappointed,The aquarium was only 1/3 full of liquid and did not give the effect of an aquarium. I was so disappointed and my son did not even put it up in the baby's crib...A lot of money for nothing.
3,"$50 for Aquarium, $50 for batteries","Poor engineering causes this toy to eat batteries...four ""C"" size at a time which is NOT cheap nor good for the environment. For that, it gets two stars taken away. If you leave it on just music, it will play forever, however to get the movement and bubbles, it draws a lot of power.My son would sit in his crib and ""watch TV"" as we called it. As soon as he could pull up, he was much more interested with the adult buttons on the top!A few times, we heard the soft music playing through the baby monitor and knew he had gotten up and turned it on. Very precious."
3,Whoa.. It's a fish and bubbles...,I bought this item for my not quite one month old for Easter. I use it mostly at night after putting her back to bed after her overnite feedings. It works well in getting her attention until she drifts back to dreamland. I like the remote because I can sneak back to her room and turn it off without waking her since she is a light sleeper.
3,Aquarium with only half-water,"We love the aquarium but only gave it three stars because the water is only 1/2 way filled in the aquarium. The aquarium its self was in good shape, lights and music work but obviously the water is a big part and it doesn't even cover the fish or plants so it takes away from the feel of the aquarium. I bought this product knowing it was used because it was described as ""great condition"". I also felt it could have been packaged better."
2,love it but hate it.,I bought this for my daughter. She loved it. She used this for some time until the water started to everaperate and now it doent have water to even use. I hate when that starts to happen and so i wish it would have stayed in longer so i could use it for my other children.
5,It does the trick!,"After transitioning my daughter from the bassinet to the crib at 10 weeks old, I needed something to sooth her. She loved her mobile that came with her bed set, but it was wind up and only played for 3 minutes. My aunt use to have one of these aquariums for my cousins 12 years ago and was delighted to find out they still made them (even though they are a little different today). She is mesmerized by it. It plays for 18 minutes and sometimes I have to hit it 2 or 3 times before she falls asleep. I don;t use the remote. I think they should get rid of the remote and make the product a little less expensive. The batteries do run out fairly quick, like every 3-4 weeks using it multiple times a day, but it is still worth the cost of replacing the batteries often. I definitely recommend this for babies who need a soother for bedtime."
5,No way I could live without this for my son!,"I had a similar fish aquarium baby mobile, but I replaced it with the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. What a difference! I like that the lights are not too bright to keep my son awake. The movements of the fish, crab, and seaweed are quite realistic. My son loves the bubbles! The music is very soothing and of high quality; it puts me to sleep quite often too. The song/sound choices are excellent. I particularly like the medley of all the songs. The remote works great and I haven't had any problems with it. The thing I like best about this mobile as compared to my old one is how long the music plays for. It plays for about 18-20 minutes. If you like to have the lights, music & motion on at the same time, it does go through 3 C-sized batteries fairly quickly. My son is almost a year old and I've had this mobile since he was just a few weeks old and he still loves it! I don't know what I would have done without it."
2,must replace batteries frequently,"If you want the full show (movement, lights, and music), it runs down the batteries quickly. Then you have to break out the screw driver to replace the batteries (why do all baby toys require batteries & screw drivers? How about an A/C adapter, or at least easier-to-get-to batteries?). It was very difficult to attach it to the crib with the plastic straps. All that effort and my 4 month old (who's had it for 2 months) could care less about it. He prefers watching the mobile over head."
2,Did not last..,"We had this toy for a little over 4 months and it just stopped working. It wasn't even used daily. It started acting funny, the lights would go out and the music would slur so I thought the batteries were getting low. I replaced the batteries with all new Energizer brand batteries and it seemed to work okay. 2 days later it won't even come on.."
2,"Only 2 stars because of remote control ""bug""","Only giving this 2 stars because when used in a room that has a TV, the TV's remote will turn on/off this device every time you change the volume!..should have gone through better Q/A so as to not interfere with other components (for those of us who start off the baby in our room and also have a TV in our room..)."
1,TOTAL RIP OFF!!!,I can't believe that this piece of junk cost a hundred bucks! So totally not worth it. You are better served spending your hard-earned money on something else.
1,Battery acid leaks from toy,This crib toy was great until the battery acid began to leak and trickled the rails of the crib and of course my daughter got it on her hands and mouth. Fortunately she didn't get any burns on her skin or mouth but this stuff has lead in it and all sorts terrible things. I was VERY upset. We have had the toy for a little over a year. I'm just surprised I haven't seen any recalls.
5,sleepy toy,"Have had this in my son's crib since he has been in it! I did not pay $72 for it though, so shop around. He has flipped it, jumped on it, used it for hours at a time and it is still going two years plus! We love it and are trying to think of a way to mount it on his soon to be big boy bed!"
3,Loved it til it stopped working,"My son absolutely loved this thing, it is the reason he went off to his crib without a word of protest. He'd lay there quietly just watching it. It does eat batteries faster than some of the other crib toys we have. Unfortunately it no longer moves or blows bubbles, it just lights up and plays music. My son got bored of it and my daughter isn't interested in it either. But when it worked, it was a big hit with my son until he was 20 months old (that's when it stopped working)."
4,Great toy for the money,"We received this toy as a gift when our baby was born. She is now 2 1/2 and still loves the fish. When she was a baby it was great for calming and soothing her to sleep. She loved to watch the bubbles and the fish. I love the different choices of sounds and music. We have used this toy every night, it makes a great night light and the soothing music helps the child know it is bedtime.The only problem we had with this product is that it comes with a remote, and the remote runs on the same frequency as our TV remote! So if we used the TV remote it would turn the aquarium on. After 2 1/2 years some of the water has evaporated, but it still works.I recommend this toy over the Twighlight turtle, which we also have. This toy combines music and lights where the Twighlight turtle only had lights. Also the Turtle is starting to come unglued and losing stuffing.Fisher Price high quality toys are worth the money!"
3,measure your pet,"the item was to keep my dog from biting himself in the hindquaters . had it been the right size it most likley would have worked. as one reviewer had mentioned it did slide down my pets neck. it was on the small side, I would recomend it if you need something fast. but I would also strongly recomend to measure you pet to make sure you are getting the right size"
3,A bit too big for cats,"Even the small size is a bit big for a regular size cat (and even for my larger 14lb maine coon mix). The velcro allows you to close it tighter, but if your cat is determined to get it off, they will push it off their head with their back paws in seconds (like mine did). That said, it's nice and light and good quality, but I am only able to use it on my tamer cat, or under constant supervision, which kind of defeats the purpose.Would be great for dogs since the velcro would be much stronger if its whole surface was used while closed."
3,It works but too short for a dog with a long neck,"If your dog has a long neck, you need to measure from where you think the collar would stop from moving down on the neck."
2,Top Performance Elizabethan,The collar is very well designed for looks but does not work very well. We put one on our dog and it was off in 45 minutes. The dog runs into stuff and the snaps come undone.The only way we could keep it on him was to staple it at the snaps. The old design works better.
2,Didn't perform as expected,"My sick dog was chewing his fur and this product did nothing to help him. In fact, the abrasive edge was used by the dog to rub itself causes even more bald spots. For some reason, the large dog version wasn't big enough because it was able to still chew on fur and my dog is only a 50 pound german shepard mix. Not sure if this product works as intended, it certainly did not for my dogs. Only good point is the velco, which does not break like the cheap plastic tabs on cheaply made E-collars @ Petco."
2,it was too traumatic for my dog,"My dog was so freaked out, I could not use it. I asked my vet and he recommended that we didn't use it."
2,Flat as a Pancake,"Though the idea is great, this item was shipped in a flat envelope and arrived flat as a pancake and with a permanent crease in it. As a result, the thing will not stay open, and wants to fold in half on the dog's head. I'd go to the local Petsmart if you need one of these...."
3,Medium was too small.,"The dog for which I purchased this is 28 lbs, which I consider a medium-sized dog. While the medium size collar fit her neck just fine, with room to spare, it wasn't deep enough to prevent her from chewing on her back leg and lower tail area. I really like the velcro attachment. The replacement collar I bought at Petsmart uses plastic tabs that I can tell won't last."
3,Protects small necks,"But my Tibetian Spaniel is able to still reach for his paws. I use this item under a longer, more durable item."
1,Too short for size of neck,"Given the neck measurements, and comparing these to similar sized cones, the length of the cone is far to short to be effective for the size of the dog it is meant to fit for. The product then is pretty ineffective. Having read the reviews I sized up on purpose, however it was still too short, however I felt that I looked at the measurements correctly, feel like they may be misleading. The comfy cone is probably a better buy."
3,It does its job.,I purchased two of these to keep my dogs from getting at them selves and each other. They worked well and for the price I have nothing to complain about. The one issue we had was the cloth piping that goes around the end came off from the dog itching at it. Not a big deal...
3,Vertical bit doesn't cut it - at least not smoothly,"This is the first Bosch bit I have ever bought. It is also the first vertical raised panel bit that I have bought. I don't know if it is the brand of bit or the style of bit (I would suspect the latter), but it doesn't give smooth cuts, even when doing multiple passes in pine. There is also a substantial amount of tear-out. In the future, I will buy non-vertical raised panel bits, even though they tend to cost more."
4,Good Value,"This belt was outrageously cheap compared to a Motorcraft, so cheap that if it lasted only a month it was worth it just to see! I haven't even used it yet but it looks okay, not quite as heavy as the Motorcraft but thought I'd take a chance because it was marketed by Prestone. (how bad can it be)! Country of manufacture is Korea where they're big into making rubber products like Kumho tires. Can't go wrong for the price."
5,Wow!!,"This book is simply amazing. I received my copy, flipped through it, and then I bought two more copies. One to read (actually, there's nothing to read), the second one for just in case the first one falls apart, and the third copy for the office."
4,Not quite perfect,"Some great photography of some beautiful subjects. If you've seen the swimsuit issues you know the style. The photos range from around the days of Brinkley to Casta.The only reason I say it's not quite perfect is that they seem to have been a little too ambitious on the size of the book. Almost every photo is stretched to the limits of the pages, which can make for great impact, but some of the photos have lost a little quality being blown up that much. You can see some graininess in several of the shots; I think most of them are the older ones. Most of the pages are fine however.It would also have been nice to see some of the body paint pics in here but they are absent.Overall a nice book."
5,Wow!,"I think this is a beautiful collection of some of the all time great SI Swimsuit photographs, reproduced as never before; large, and on great paper. Frank deFord has written a really interesting history of how the SI Swimsuit edition got started. But basically it's about the photographs - lots and lots of them. I have missed Kathy , Stacy, Elle, and all the other SI Swimsuit greats, now I have them all in one stunning edition. A great gift for any guy."
4,If you love the original...,".. you'll like this one... Has some of the original Master of Monster Pro's and a new ones,. Has new monsters, new items, a lot of things but it doesn't have a diference beetwen ""Masters"" Summons. But its good and gonna give a lot of hours of fun and strategy. The 23 chapters are long enough to put your brain to work but in some places are predictables. If you played good enough, the game is gonna give you a few Extra Episodes... try it!"
4,Master of Monsters,This is a great game for people who like to combine strategy with luck and a little Fantasy Fiction. The only drawbacks are it's speed and limitations compared to the original version on Sega Genesis.
1,bad,"do not buy unles you like corny games with bad graghics,horrable fighting and realy bad story. So if you like those all buy it but your $ would be spent better for anything."
4,"solid material, hard to apply","Argyis' books are not an easy read. The same applies to this one. Being a researcher he invests a lot in trying to appear scientific. However, the material is still based on real-life examples, one specific example dealing with a group of executives who try to apply the principles of organizational learning to their new company.Some of the ocnversations appear rather artificial in terms of the communication style and verbiage used. I have never heard anyone talk like that in real life.The whole approach appears somewhat idealistic and hardly applicable to real life. That team of executives was only successful through coaching over a period of several years and because the whole group had committed to the experiment.Try that on your own in a real-life office environment: good luck.The approach may work, but only in the right (lab-like?) environment."
2,Disappointed,"Although the potential for interesting facts, developments, and history certainly exists in the comparison of Vermont and New Hampshire, this collection falls short. It eventually ends up with rude, false pieces that are of no real interest or value. Too bad the editor did not put more effort into this collection"
3,The band Rocks but the vocals blow!,"This band deserves Kudos for a smoking high energy live performance but I'm a little suprised that there seems to be nothing but 5 star reviews. I'm as much of a fan as anyone, but lets face it, Ian's voice is shot. Gone are the soaring vocals which were a cult trademark. Astbury can't hold a note that last more than 2 seconds anymore. I found myself gasping for breath for him the whole time I was watching it. Give Ian credit, he still puts a lot of energy into his performance, but the pipes just arent there any more. Thier last release showed no indication that his voice was failing. So now I'm wondering if this was just a bad night or if heavy production was used to enhance the vocals on the last CD. I would still recommend the DVD to true fans because the band still sounds awsome. I just would warn them to temper their expectations when it comes to Ian's vocals."
3,"Inconsistent, but still glad I have it","As another reviewer mentions, the crowd seems subdued, which takes some of the energy away from the performance. Ian tries to inspire them, but he tends to sound corny with his lectures and cajoling. It also would help if he put more energy into some of the songs - Fire Woman is lackluster at best. However, the newer songs sound fresh and he is clearly more into them. Billy never moves around a lot, but his riffs are still the center of attention. Even with the inconsistent performance, I still enjoyed the DVD. I also appreciate the longer camera shots - I really hate when concerts are edited such that the shot switches every 2 seconds."
4,"Great, but check out the HD version if you can...","I just recorded this show in HD from HDnet on cable, then checked out this DVD via Netflix. Killer show, but this DVD version of the Olympic show pales in comparison video quality-wise with the HD version now playing on cable...too bad they can't release the HD version on DVD as well."
3,Be prepared,Singer don't sing like on the cd's. He is showing his age. Other than that the show is ok. Don't expect a rocking concert.
2,Coulda been fantastic,"I'm a longtime Cult fan, from the Electric era and I've got to admit Ian really brings this DVD down. I've never had the oppportunity to see The Cult live before so I am not sure how this performance compares to others but Ian just seems to yell or speak the lyrics more than sing them and he in my opinion needs to talk way less between songs. The song selection is awesome, the sound quality is awesome, and Billy Duffy's guitar absolutely rocks on both new and old tracks. Ian needs to watch something like The Cure's Trilogy DVD for a clue on how to preserve their art for all time's sake in DVD form. Worth watching for Cult fans but not as good as it could have been."
4,Well Done Cult,"The 3rd music DVD I have watched on my new Philips progressive scan machine. Best sound thus far. DTS is the way to do music on DVD at least until they come up with something better. This one is done the way they all should be done,the concert from start to finish or at least everything they didn't edit out. All the filler and behind the scenes stuff is a separate feature all together. One star deduction for blurry or out of focus from front camera angle. Probably would not show up unless viewed on big screen. Turn it up. If it's too load, you're to old!"
5,One of the best DTS mastered DVD so far,Most of the previous reviews were just right. The DTS sound on this DVD is in fact one of the best I have ever listened to. I highly recommend it for every Cult or Rock fan on the road.
3,"Keep out the negative politics, lower the bass, take off the headband","The song Edie (Ciao Baby), lacked the musical fade out and just ended abruptly. Ian's headband was down over his eyebrows like some punk, and he had negative things to say about the USA, three weeks after 9-11-01. The bass was too loud and masked a lot of vocals. The rhythm guitarist was not shown much. Ian also used a lot of profanity, which was a turn off. Otherwise, it was a great concert. From reviews of the latest concert DVD, this one is better. I definitely wouldn't want to see the latest one, if that is the case."
3,Battle worn band,"I tried to give this DVD a better review, I love The Cult but the drive seems to be long gone from this band. Overall its not a bad show but the vocals are just not there, Ian's voice has always been a driving force behind the bands songs like Fire woman and Sweet Soul Sister but he drops the ball on this DVD, the vocals are just dead.Mike"
1,Limp and boring read,"One of the most boring books that I have ever read...left you limp and bored. Especially, since it comes from the land of Khajurao and the Kama Sutra. India and it's women are highly sensual and sexual, as I have encountered. And, if you get a ""Tantric""...woe betide the hours of fun.The Desi women and men in this book, had sad lives and their repressed sexuality reflects that of a damp squid...not real Indians.Ughh !!! What a quick read and waste of money. I threw it the same day in the garbage - where it belongs.cause68usa@netscape.net"
5,Pin-Ups For A Classic Car Lovers,"Beutifuly detailed 3 page pullouts and cutaway drawings, This is not a book of car history or Bestselling ""RiceBurners"" this book Delivers what is promises. 100 Great Car Cutaway Drawings."
3,The only thing good about this book was the art..,"..cause really, a GL vs Aliens book? Just how believable could it be when one weilds a ring that could do anything you want? It can't. So, what's to be done? You make the hero lose the ring again!! Definitely a tired and contrived plot in these superheroes vs whatever crossovers where we all know, at their best, the heroes would cream these aliens. It gets worse in that they killed off several ex-members of the GL Corps..again!!! Only bright spot is that ther art looks good and is the only thign that made me pick up this story arc."
3,Not the best in the series.,"""Will's Story 1771"" was not the best addition to the Young Americans series. With the previous books, there were adventure, turmoil, and bigger conflicts. Will's problems seemed small, and he wasn't a strong character. I still give credit for making his life come alive again through this series. I ""sorta"" recommend."
5,Very pretty,"Perfect, high quality, very stylish! I could tell just from the outside packaging that these were keepers! I will be purchasing more for myself and to give as gifts. A really nice touch."
1,quality of product,"I have purchased and assembled many products but none of such poor quality as this one. First I was lacking in bolts and nuts. I purchased $14.00 worth bolts and nuts. The most serious problem was a part that was lacking a hole and the one whole in the part was incorrectly placed. The lever that raises and lowers the wheels could not be installed until I ground off the end so as to line up the one hole that was drilled and drilled a second hole for the two retaining bolts.Had I not had the tools to grind and drill, I would have sent this back."
4,Good overall,"Have used this a couple of times now. Works well, though even with the max 160 pounds on it, I can only get cores an inch deep, sometimes 1.5 inches deep. It is supposed to be able to get cores as deep as three inches. Maybe in soil that's already un-compacted.No problems with assembly, though the box arrived with holes in it, and the hardware bag had split inside, so a screw was missing. Easy to replace at the store.And one side axle has gotten slightly bent, I assume because I always use the 160 pound blocks.But overall for the money, its okay by me."
4,Trying to keep it home,Since getting this we've had neighbors asking to use it. It goes behind my husband's John Deere mower beautifully and has saved use a ton in nothing having to pay someone else to do this or rent the equipment.
1,Worst packaging I've ever seen,"When I received this item, it was send UPS ground. By the time I got it, there were so many rips in the packaging that I was missing tons of parts (including the axle). Bags inside were ripped and I was also missing tons of bolts and washers. I called the company and they were very arrogant. I don't blame amazon because it was packaged by agri-fab. No styrofoam or protection was used in the box and the cardboard was recycled flimsy junk. Everything was just thrown inside. Thankfully amazon sent me another one via fed-ex that was in better shape but the way this is packaged is an abomination. Even the replacement item I received is scrateched to hell because of poor packaging. If you want this item, buy it from sears or somewhere else where you can look at it before purchasing."
4,Happy with Blocks,"These blocks are very sturdy and my daughters love building things with them. I should have read the description more carefully though, there are a large amount of the little tiny blocks."
3,sturdy and a little expensive,"They are very sturdy as cardboard boxes. They are the good size for toddlers. The price dropped a little since I bought half years ago, but still a bit too expensive. If you're a wholesale club memeber, you may find much better price there."
4,fun while they lasted...,"My kids has ALOT of fun with these bricks!! Unfortunately, through some major rough playing they started tearing and getting misshaped. We slowly threw bricks away as they got too damaged and now we have none. But it was a lot of fun while they lasted!"
5,Great choice,"These blocks are sturdy- they don't bend even when a preschooler is standing on them. My son loves to line the biggest blocks up and use them as a balance board. They don't bend to his weight at all.They are not hard to put together- I did it in about 20 min. They do require some space to store, though. I keep all of ours on a two shelf bookshelf.This is a classic toy that your child will love for many years."
4,Awesome Blocks,"Had a similar set when I was little that I built with until I was almost 12, and purchased this set for a 3 yr old relative. Unfortunately I had to buy two sets to really get enough of the big blocks for him to build something with, but otherwise I have no complaints. He was incredibly excited to get them and couldn't wait to open the boxes."
5,Fantastic Creative Play Toy,"I purchased these blocks for my 26 month old twin girls. The blocks come in pre-folded flat forms that you have to assemble, which takes about 30 minutes for the entire box. My girls have utilized these almost every day by stacking, throwing, standing on them, making walls and plowing through them with their balance bikes and jumping on them. These blocks really take a beating and look no worse for the wear. They even tried to wash a few in the sink and they dried perfectly. The blocks can be cleaned with either a damp cloth or Lysol wipes with no issue. I was totally recommend these as a must have toy."
4,Cardboard brick blocks,"These are a MUST! The samll kids and up enjoy building, and of course knocking down, their towers. They are light, colorful and because of the three differnt shapes can encourage spatial decisions...or not! I find some think very ernestly about their towering designs, while others just put one on top of the other- no matter its size or shape. So far they have held up very well. Standing on them will quickly destroy them but so far, all the kids in the play group have not even considered doing so. My kids had these and they are now in their late teens. I actually still use them to put under items on the very top of my kitchen cabinets so the decorative item sits higher and is more visible. They were much more expensive than when I bought them for my kids. I got 48 blocks for 10 dollars back then, but times do change. Hope this helps!"
4,Nice,This toy is cardboard and it is a great toy as long as your child is old enough to understand that they can't smash it. It is a very popular toy in preschools and day cares.
4,Satisfied,"I purchased these blocks for the church nursery because my own children and their friends enjoyed them so much when they were young. I am only disappointed that there weren't more of the large blocks in the set. Overall, I am certainly satisfied--especially with the prompt shipment."
5,Demolition crew,My son loves to make towers and then knock them down! These are great! The boxes fold in a way that provides support in the middle where you would worry about them being weaker. My only regret is that I would have ordered the larger set. There aren't enough to make a fort! ;)
5,The Simplest Toys are the Best,"My son got a set of these last Christmas when he was 2, and now we give them as gifts all the time! He gets hours of enjoyment from building castles, garages, towers...anything his imagination cooks up. (He sometimes even tapes on faces and builds animals, and once he set out to construct every letter of the alphabet with his blocks!) This is a great gift for ages 2 and up...even my 10 year old nephew still loves to play with them when he comes over. It's an excellent gift that grows with the child, and parents will thank you for giving a toy that doesn't beep, light up, or require batteries."
3,Not for 2 year olds.,"I bought these blocks for my children to share and they love them but the youngest can easily take them apart. We assembled them the correct way yet he can still take them apart and warp the cardboard. He's 2 1/2 yrs old. I would not recommend these blocks for this age range. We have a set of foam blocks that are a MUCH better choice and have held up longer, for him. We've only owned these Melissa and Doug jumbo cardboard blocks for less than two months and already at least 4 are damaged. HOWEVER they're a huge hit with my 4 year old and 6 year old and would be more durable for their age range."
1,"Not as expected for ""JUMBO"" blocks","Misleading picture. I wanted the REAL jumbo sized blocks such as the 4 that came with. When reading about these blocks, I could not read on the box the fine print description giving sizes of blocks. I expected more of the big boxes because they were listed as JUMBO. Instead, most are very small, few are little bit bigger and again...only 4 of the bigger boxes. This was a big disappointment and waste of money that I'm quite sure will just be thrown away soon enough. Very glad I didn't order the 40 boxes...can you imagine what that would be like??? 25 or so of the little 3x5s all over the floor? YIKES!"
4,"Each block DOES NOT measure 19""L x 12.5""W x 5.75""H","The manufacturers information on Amazon states that ""Each block measures 19""L x 12.5""W x 5.75""H"". This is untrue. There are 24 blocks of various sizes, the largest blocks are 19""L x 12.5""W x 5.75""H.My kids love playing with them. The information was just misleading."
3,Eh - kind of a lot of money for not that much cardboard,"I bought these blocks expecting some JUMBO blocks. Eh. While they're great quality (my kid STANDS on them and doesn't crush them - he's 26 pounds), there was't as many as I was expecting, or, I guess more appropriately, there wasn't many of the awesome blocks as I was expecting. In short, you only get 4 of the red blocks and 6 of the blue blocks and those are the two biggest of the bunch (and what I think are the really fun ones). You get a TON of yellow which is actually more of a pain to clean up. Perhaps people were looking for that kind of detail but I think even the box pictures says it with those two kids playing with blue blocks: they like the bigger ones. I honestly went to Home Depot and just got some moving boxes for $5 and my kid played with those WAY more. These are now barely a novelty in the house."
5,Excellent plug cutter,"I bought this to cut a 3/4 inch plug, so I could then saw off this slices to replace missing slices on the bottom of chess pieces. It made a clean cut in piece of holly. Not likely to have much use of this cutter. That happens in woodworking."
4,Great Early Graphics,"This is such an awesome game, and is so much better than the first one, I really enjoy the ablility to play two totally diffrent characters in the same action game. If you like kids games like Spyro, and Gex you'll love this one!"
1,Myopic review: no 1950's D-2s,"From a very narrow perspective: I was specifically looking for information on 1950s D-2 Cats. Unfortunately this book deals only with the J series of D-2, ending in 1947. So, ten years of the U series of D-2s (1947-1957) have no coverage in this book. This, despite the book's teasers that the U series had a different (D311) engine and ""many design changes""... Quite disappointing for a D-2 fan..."
4,Heaven and Hell,"Sorry about the corny title, but I had to think of something.I was given this book on my birthday and pretty much read it straight away. I was really intrigued by the title and the premise. I must say it took me a while to get into it, but after a while I could not stop reading Who's Who, until I finished it in one go.I really wanted the actual compiling of Daniel's book to extend further into the novel, but that's not what it is really about. The relationship between Daniel and Laura is really the crux of the story. At times I was getting (annoyed) with it, but by the end I was hooked. Obviously I will not say what happens, needless to say I had no idea and could not stop telling people about it afterwards.I have read a lot of books recently, very glutinous, but this one stood out becuase of the range of emotions that it produces. The final scene is amazing, I wish I could publish it here, but that would wreck the ending to a bloody brilliant novel."
2,Good moments that go nowhere,"I agree with the person who says that this should have been a short story collection. There are some great moments, interesting characters, amusing vignettes, but they just fade out and lead to nothing. Stick to Nick Hornby!"
1,I challenge you Will Wong,I challenge you Mr. Will Wong to a duel. Ill slice you and dice you with my knife.
1,Stay away from this book,"This book talks about accounting in a limited way. Whereas it says that it aims to present accounting to the reader regardless of his/her background, the book certainly fails to do so. Organization of information is poorly executed, and lack of depth and non-randomization of scenarios make the readers' perspective quite limited."

2,not so great,Item not made for normal size drawers. Check your measurements. When i followed the instructions and contacted the company by email to return I did not hear back. I waited for two weeks. I had to call them and then it was handled.
3,Good for the price,"The spice rack in a drawer is a great thing. I can see all my spices, keep them in order and this is much better than the clutter of a rack on the counter. The expand-to-fit is great in concept, but in practice, this design needs a bit of a tweak. In order to make it stay put in the size I set it to I had to tape it in place. There are teeth on the side segments that are intended to catch to the center segment. They do catch, but don't hold together. For the price though, it's a winner. I am happy with the product."
4,Spacesaver,"Nice and handy for containing often-used spices near the cooking top. Expanding sides make good fit inside drawer. Unfortunately, had to give up the former ""odds-and-ends"" drawer, but worth the convenience."
5,"Money is all about Attitude, and so is this book","I've loved SARK's work since finding her greeting cards, then her calendar many years ago. Never before bought a SARK book.Prosperity Pie is as free-thinking, stream of consciousness as her cards, and I enjoy her colorful handwriting as text in the book as well, would never have dreamed of a book looking like this before buying it.Fun, easy to read, and full of thinking outside the box ideas for appreciating the money we have, and what we have that's not made from money. A pleasure.Five stars since it delivers what it promises, ideas about how to relax in a free-wheeling, yet, goal-oriented way."
1,Dissapointing,"This is the fourth SARK book I have read and I have to say that I'm dissapointed. Prosperity Pie lacks substance. It doesn't focus on any one particular subject and bounces from chapter to chapter and from fuzzy topic to fuzzy topic. Prosperity Pie lacked substance and I got little out of what I did read. It lacked details and the title was misleading. It was filled with voids. I think the reason why I didn't like it as much as SARK's other books is because I think I was searching for something more than was written. I was hoping for a concise, 'this is what you should do with your paycheque' type of book. Instead, only one small chapter really deals with actual finacial situations."
1,"Same old stuff, new title","First, why is ""money"" even in the title when the number of pages that cover money is just a small handful. The ""everything else"" covers most of the book and it is redundant and quite frankly not nearly as inspiring or funny or juicy or succulent as her previous books. I own all of her books and love them all except this last one. She is one of the few authors who I have bought the book each time it comes out, regardless of having heard anything about it. I buy her books because of past, positive experiences. Well, no more. From now on, I think I'll wait until there's a library copy available and then if I like it, I'll buy the book. I would definitely not have purchased this one. I felt like it was an attempt for her publishers to repackage old material and make some money."
2,Getting tired,"I love SARK's books; they aren't literature, but they are uplifting and honest. However, it seems like this one was cranked out, like formula, so she could get out her one book a year (just like Woody Allen, whose movies have also gotten very tired). Maybe she needs to take a longer break, to recharge her creative juices. Maybe she needs the time and breathing space to read her own books, like A Creative Companion. Even some of her hand lettering in this one looks like it was done in a great rush, without much thought. Better luck next time, SARK!"
3,Not so excited,I agree the action and pacing is good- kick ass heroine- but I get kind of tired pretty quickly with Kimmer and her being dumbfounded by her attraction to Rio the male lead and her not being able to figure him out. Convoluted plotting. Use of cutesy nicknames for the various thugs is used throughout and we are supposed to find it as fun as the lead Kimmer does. I did not. I really like the Bombshell line in general- even with these speed bumps the women in daring roles and doing unconventional things is great- really pushes the envelope and provides a great model for future romances. I just wish there was some more one on one time with the hero and heroine. I know this is the first book in a series of adventures- but I would like to feel more solid about the romance element by the end of this book- not three books down the road.
1,"do. not. buy,","THIS IS HORRIBLE. horrible. do. not. buy. ink literally does not connect to the nibs correctly. you will end up with it all over your hands, exhausted and tired. really. don't buy this."
2,T-2 to Supertanker,"A hard read for the layman just looking for some background information into the history of supertanker development. Although it had it moments, the book was poorly organized and didn't flow well. I was expecting a chronological look at the development of supertankers and instead the book had a number of disjointed chapters that each sort of flow in chronological order. The title needs to be redone as the book mentions events after 2000."
3,It was Okay,"This movie was slightly better than average. For the most part, it was okay. It was not as moving as some other dramas, such as the Notebook - which was also written by the same author."
2,Mediocre,All in all a bit dull. I didn't like the ending and they wasted hiring a fine actress in Leslea Fisher and giving her virtually no lines in the film. What a waste of talent.
2,Dear john dvd,Once I received the DVD I opened it up to find that there was many scratches. Up to now it would not play on my DVD player.
2,Disapointment,"I love the book. It is beautiful.The movie barely follows the book. If you had not read the book you might like the movie, but if you had read the book, not even bother."
3,Very Predictable!!!,"After seeing The Last Song, and researching the works of Nicholas Sparks, I somehow knew what was going to happen, because it's all the same. A soldier named John Tyree meets Savannah Lynn Curtis, and they fall in love after two weeks. When John has to return to the Army, they promise to write each other every day. If for some reason you like Nicholas Spark's work, you might like DEAR JOHN!!!"
5,dear John,"it is a great movie, a great story. recommend it to all. And it is a good family movie- Ba"
