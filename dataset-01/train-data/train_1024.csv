3,Don't take life so seriously because...,You are not going to get out of life alive anyway-the lyricist had a good point about lightening up.
4,Not owning this CD is like not owning a pair of shoes.,"A great CD. Two notable tracks are ""When Doves Cry"" which was made considerably less gay by Quindon Tarver and ""Everybody's Free To wear Sunscreen"" recited By Baz Luhrmann. Everybody's Free is a motivating and hopegiving song set to a cool, Thoughtful background music. Buy it and be free to wear sunscreen."
4,Sunscreen Smash,This unusual album is noteworthy for one song. Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen is a modern classic. Deeply cool graduation speech set to funky backbeat provided by Quindon Tarver.
5,Advice Worth Listening Too,"Even though I'm merely 16, even I can recognize good lyrics from a wise man. Granted the music isn't the best in the world, but the CD is still worth every penny. This is definitely advice worth considering. The only thing wiser than this CD is ""Poor Richard's Almanack"" by Benjamin Franklin."
5,Something for everyone - everybody's free - when you hear it,"A powerful song, words, lyrics. The music, the mood, the voice. Who is the voice of 'everybody's free'???? LEE PERRY is, not Mary or Baz or Kurt. Lee Perry is the voice of our hearts and mind, he is the father we never had, the caring grand dad, the advice we wish we'd lived by. Without his voice this amazing song would be nothing but beautiful words with no direction."
3,Eight of the 16 tracks good.,"Because there are a few to many ballads and--get this---ballroom tracks on it, I am not so sure this cd should be classified as dance/dj. Excluding the sunscreen song and a fabulous remix of Prince's 'when doves cry' I was somewhat dissappointed. However,I have ""learned to love"" a total of seven of the 15 tracks (and no, the seven i do like are not ballroom!)"
4,witty,an extremly well put together album - my favoutate track being ''Everybodys free ( to wear sunscreen)''.Great work - and imagination
1,Once Again...,"I submitted a review stating how much this CD sucks, and it never showed up. Perhaps I was too offensive. Well, once again, THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!!!! There are no ""songs"" on this, it's just a bunch of incoherent drivel. I don't understand why people like ""Sunscreen"" so much. It's not even a song. I tremble at the thought of music going in this direction. Take advice from a sane person and don't buy this CD. I'd like to add that Kurt Vonnegut (despite what you may have heard) did not write ""Sunscreen"". He's a genius, and he wouldn't waste his time. I'd also like to add that if this review doesn't show up, I'll just send another one."
1,"Hang up your cell phone, and park the Volvo, yuppies!","""Filander"" is a big word, too, and your buddy dispensing advice on the Baz Luhrmann album uses it. So, if big words like ""swill"" are too challenging for you, then the money you donate to PBS on your way to the jazz and wine festival is NOT well spent. At least you got a license late holder."
1,Yuck!Yuck!Yuck!Yuck!Yuck!Yuck!Yuck!,"What sort of songs are those?It's just someone talking about"" You are not as fat as you imagine"", ""Don't buy magazines, they will only make you feel ugly"", ""Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't"" etc. Please! I don't know why this was even released as a song! If not for the music, this would sound like an eulogy reading at a funeral. And that's only Everybody's Free .It makes me shudder to think about the other so-called songs"
4,love it,"I love this cd. All of the remixes are fabulous, especially ""When Doves Cry"" and ""Happy Feet."" I had this cd when it first came out and lost it a few years later. I was so happy to be able to still find it. :)"
2,The Sunscreen Song Sucks,"I'll just honestly say that the only song I've heard on this CD is the sunscreen song on the radio. If the song was sold on single I would give it 1 star there, but I have to be nice to the songs that I haven't heard yet. Anyway, I think the sunscreen song is absolutely awful and stupid. Yeah, sure, it does have meaningful advice in the lyrics, but the song itself sucks. Just go buy Chicken Soup for the Teenager's Soul (1) if you love it so much - you'll find the lyrics written out (I think in one of the back sections) and you'll get lots more great advice too."
2,Did it just come out of a time capsule?,"Most of the songs in this disappointing CD are best left in the past as relics.As far as Sunscreen goes, it's just rhetoric most reasonable people already know. It doesn't sound particularly good either. And as for the UNreasonable people who don't know the rhetoric, it's unlikely they're bright enough to understand that 'song' anyway. Let's not get carried away with how 'motivational' or 'inspirational' Sunscreen is - it's just fake and dull."
2,WHAT THE &*@^????!!!!!!!,"What's up with this record?? Umm...""Everyone's Free to Wear Sunscreen""? Really?? What a revalation!! Thanks man for being so avant-guarde!! Gee, I got one "" Everyone's Free to Wipe Your Tuchas."" Get lost!"
5,Yum,"The Best. I take 2 at a time once or twice a day, or when I feel like it. The bottle has a strange and intoxicating smell, like there's some kind of vitamin goodness off-gassing from these little capsules. I can feel when I need to take some, they're that good. Especially if I've been drinking. I sincerely hope they extend my lifespan significantly."
3,"""Generally"" Good","I was very excited to see this released on DVD as I had missed the series on NOVA. This programming is intended to spark an intrest in those who have never heard of string theory and run from the hazy world of quantum. This program is about as effective as it can possibly be for a broad overview of a subject that can not easily be explained in a broad manner. If you are new to the ideas of quantum or string theory, this may help encourage you to learn more. However, I recommend the book series of this program as it is much more informative and leaves many more unanswered questions then when you began."
3,"Good for some audiences, but can't be compared to the book.","This is an entertaining DVD that introduces the concept of string theory. It is NOT a replacement for the book which is quite detailed and goes in-depth. What what loses in detail, one gains in accessibility. If you are a very serious science person, you will likely be disappointed. If you are a layperson who just wants to get a taste of this area with some good commentary, you will most likely appreciate it."
4,The world may be flat after all !,"Brian Green has an exceptional talent for making the complex simple for the uninitiated. From Newton to P Branesthe light of understanding becomes brighter and brighter as Green guides us from complexity to simple elegance.Entertaining, educational, and highly stimulating."
3,Read if You Aren't A Science Guru,"Having a very limited background in physics & chemistry, I first watched this film and had a rough time keeping up with it. Despite the elaborate examples Greene presents, I felt as though I was being entertained more than I was being informed. If you are looking to get a gist of what string theory is broadly about, then this could be a good buy. But if you are looking for something with more substance, this will disappoint you. More effort is made on emphasizing special effects & how cool string theory is as opposed to understanding the science behind it.If you are looking for something with more substance, I would recommend the following dvds:""Cosmos"" by Carl Sagan. The BEST science program I've watched.""Evolution""""The Planets"""
4,Beautful documentairy,"In three dvd's Brian share's his knowledge of the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and sting/M-theory. All beutiful portrait by computeranimations and experiments. Must see for all physics theachers! One note; it isn't available with subtitles which makes it hard to use in classes in foreign countries like mine.Cheers."
1,Great Book -- Horrible Nova Show,I recently read The Elegant Universe and while it was extremely dense it is well written and definitely worth reading if you are interested in string theory. I HIGHLY suggest that anyone really interested in sting theory skip the Nova show and read the book.
1,Garbage !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't waste your money on this garbage, the so called ""superstring theory"" can't be supported by data and without scientifically proven that it really exists. It's the worst ""universe"" dvd that I have watched. Can't finish and don't want to waste my time on this garbage."
2,"Et tu, NOVA?","Why does every TV documentary made nowadays have to try to look like those crappy Discovery Channel shows? I was so very disappointed in this program. NOVA used to be great, and a friend had told me that this episode was worth watching, but what I found was some interesting facts and interviews ruined by the nauseating repetition of images, the too-quick editing, and the overuse of goofy visual effects and noises that made me give up on the Discovery Channel long ago. What is the point? If I want to have something repeated over and over and over again, I can use my rewind button. But when it's done for me, I have to use the fast forward instead, and that gets really tiresome. If you want an intro to string theory, I'd suggest getting a book instead."
4,Great introduction for those not familar with String Theory,"If you are not familiar with string theory, this is a very good visual and at the same time entertaining introduction. While the author/presenter's approach seems ""fresh"", ""entertaining"" and full of high tech graphics, if you watch closely, he has borrowed a few tricks from Carl Sagan when it comes to presenting science to the general population.If you expect an in-depth analysis, or a literature review on the latest research on string theory, this is definately not it.But if you are not familiar or you are vaguely familiar with String Theory, you may find this a very good starting point."
5,Great Stuff!,"I love this video series. I first saw it on PBS years ago and finally bought it for myself so I could really grasp the information. It's a must for those who want to know more about the universe and the latest big ideas, but just want the concepts, not the equations. Even if this stuff doesn't absolutely fascinate you, I recommend watching it. You'll look smart at cocktail parties when you can summarize string theory and explain how parallel universes likely exist. And the series is done in such a way that it's interesting to watch. It's like ""Quantum Mechanics for Dummies."" I love that I now know a little something about String Theory."
1,Buy this with Barney the Dinosaur and save!,"As a big fan of Brian Greene -- having read both The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos, I thought the DVD would help cement and retain ideas in the book.In fact, there is little if any content. There are, however, lots of pointless, flashy effects that convey no understanding. Lots of cool sound effects, too. Professor Greene jumps through walls and disappears with lots of swooshing noises.Toddlers will be mystified and enchanted by this. It really beats the mobile spinning over the crib."
2,the un-elegant dvd,"i can imagine what was said at the production meetings for this dvd... ""let's make it fun"" ... ""yeah, even a little goofy, for the kids!"". i have nothing against kids, but seems like this dvd was made for 7 year olds. it is horrible, the style of the narration is very annoying, made me feel like an idiot. what is even worse, it is very repetitive. in the first hour i heard countless times how this minute ""strings of energy"" were the great unifying theory, but they never explained why or how they arrived to this conclusion. it stays on the surface, never goes in deeper, i guess they were afraid to include too many numbers or symbols (mind you i am not a physicist, just a regular person). as if that wasn't enough, the 5 minutes of commercials at the beginning of each of the 5 episodes are unbearable, and there is no skiping them, this shoud be illegal, it is my dvd, why can't i skip the things i don't want to see?"
5,Awesome,I bought this to use to teach my high school students. The visual representations provided in this video are great for showing the students the world of quanta and string theory.
3,Good start but light overall!,"Well presented conceptually. However it just hover above the subject with many phrase repeations. the book is much, much more detailed and very good at describing M-theory. I like the way some concept are visually explained in the movie and the FXs are pretty good. Again; it is a well done presentation of M-theory but that is all. Overall: DECENT!"
1,"Well, it did arrive promptly ...","... after that it was a total disappointment. There was little to no useful information & constant repetition of the same interview pieces, historical perspectives & even the exact graphics throughout all 3 programs. I have no more knowledge of any facts behind String Theory than I did before. At best this could have been one glitzy & mostly pointless program .. instead, NOVA gave us 3 full hours that said the same things over & over & over again. With Brian Greene trying his best to be the second coming of Carl Sagan & failing miserably. Clearly a case of the producers stretching out limited content to fill 3 commercial time slots. I expected so much more & will look deeper next time before I buy."
5,Excellent Documentary,The Elegant Universe is a great documentary and watching it was what got me interested in String Theory in the first place. I also enjoyed the great summary of the history of physics and the promise of String Theory. I also decided to pick up the book as well and it was much more in depth and a satisfying read.This documentary is definately a great doorway to introducing anyone to physics and I recommend it highly.
3,Elegance Succumbs to Giant Sucking Sound,"Starts great, goes into endless repetition. The whole frame of reference is silly and boring: the great man view of history, no explanation necessary of their feats, all build up, no beef. Most of the hard questions here are ultimately ducked or served cold. The buildup to the genius coming in and solving the five models problem was so drawn out I thought the show had looped back on itself. And then the genius' conclusion is that the five models are all reflections of one reality. Ah, I see.... Hello? Are we that dumb? If so, why are we watching? A little more detail please."
4,Revisit your Naked Soul,"Another band that should have been more well known. blah, blah, blah, you've heard that one before but in this case they should have had a breakout hit with 'Lonely Me, Lonely You'. Much less deserving songs were on the airwaves in 1992(remember 'To Be With You' by Mr Big, let's hope not). Well not to digress to unfair comparisons but the Naked Soul ep and their full length debut are great. Yes the remake of The Who's 'So Sad About Us' is worth the price alone (for 1 cent, what is your risk here, only much to gain)"
5,very stout and hold up well,"Put these on top of a 40-70 so the recoil is pretty massive, After 30 rounds and a week in the field they are still rock solid. Zero POI shift. Totally worth the money, don't hesitate to get them if a super solid QD mount is what you are after.Dave"
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"This book is chocked full of Native American motifs and designs from many nations! Each graphic is titled by tribe, even branches of Tribes (eg: Dakota Sioux) and the book is broken down into sections of geographic areas, eg: Pacific Northwest, Great Plains, Southwest, etc. Very well put together, this was an excellent resource and the best N.A. Tribal design book I've found!"
3,american indian clipart,I was looking for american indian designs for beading patterns but this book is better suited for paper clipart. There is no CD so you have to scan the design first or use the design right out of the book. For the price I was disappointed. No one really uses one time use anymore. Designs are too small to use in many applications. A CD would be better.
4,Louis De Wohl's novels,This is the 3rd of Louis De Wohl's historical novels that I have read and they are consistently good reads. De Wohl has a talent for making his stories believable with enough fact included so they are informative about the life of the saint as well as being entertaining reading. I am interested in St. Benedict because of the impact his life and teachings have had on modern spirituality and I was not disappointed in this book.
1,Very Disappointed,"I would definitely recommend instead - St. Benedict, Hero of the Hills and St. Benedict by Mary Windeatt.While I really liked Wohl's book about the life of Catherine of Siena which showed how her life impacted the history of her time; this story of St. Benedict, however, seemed to be the opposite and was very disappointing, inaccurate and also plain boring.This book is a novel about Rome with its politics and affairs (characters giving long speeches about their feelings on the subject of Rome and its rulers). While taking great liberty in trying to tie Benedict's life in with the other characters by inventing a whole storyline, soap opera style, about St. Benedict prior to his leaving Rome and being a hermit and monk. To me it was degrading to the true story of St. Benedict's life."
4,Thorough and Insightful,"I love military history documentaries and have watched about 40 of them on the History and Discovery Channels. I bought this one because I can re-watch segments of it without getting tired of it. Its extensive (3 hours) but not boring. Its in black and white but it feels modern. It is well narrated, accurate and very thorough. I especially like the coverage of the invasion planning, which starts 2 years earlier. Its depiction of the operation to convince the Germans that Calais was the real target was excellent."
5,DDay Code Name Overlord,If you love DDay history then this DVD is one to keep on your mantel. I can watch over and over again. It's three hrs long and it will keep your interest the whole time. It begins with the build up of the Atlantic Wall all the way to the surrender of Germany.
5,Excellent!,"There is something beautiful and lasting about The Road to Fondwa. The music and cinematography immediately grab hold and pull you into its world. A world that is visually stunning and musically alive. What remains with you long after your journey is the vitality, spirit and resilience of Haiti and its people. It is evident that the filmmakers are incredibly talented, not only because this documentary skillfully captures the vivid beauty of Haiti but more so because as storytellers they embraced the spirit, love, and hopes of the people they meet. Fondwa is so engaging I stopped relating to myself as an audience member at all. Instead I found myself caring more deeply for my fellow man, not with pity but with inspiration. The Road to Fondwa reminded me that the effort to empower yourself and bring change to your country is not only noble but also possible.I highly recommend seeing The Road to Fondwa!"
4,Crazy cool (and still informative!),"This is not your typical boring doco but a true sneak peek into the real lives of every day people struggling to meet challenges you and I will never know. It's short, to the point, wonderfully done and charming, all while revealing a fantastic culture made more beautiful by its hardship."
5,Awesome!,The Road to FondwaThe Road to Fondwa is a beautiful film made with incredible heart. It's a documentary that doesn't try to shock or sadden its viewers with scenes of extreme poverty. It's picture of Haiti is real. It shows the hardships but it also focuses on the beautiful countryside and the unrelenting spirit of the Haitian people. The shots of Haiti were absolutely beautiful and made me fall in love with the country even though I've never set foot there. It's truly a great piece of work and highly recommended!
5,Great read,"Wise writes a good character driven story, displaying both the dark and warm side of humanity during the Civil War in a makeshift hospital called Chimborazo. The characters are real and likeable, and Wise's description is so good that you learn just as much from a character's silence as from his or her dialogue. The impending sense of doom as the North closes in on Richmond is wonderfully developed. There is much tragedy in this story, but there is great compassion in the face of this tragedy. Wise also illustrates the chaos of the time where southerner can attack southerner. As one of the characters realizes, there are good and bad individuals no matter where they come from. I recommend this book highly."
5,The best civil war book I have ever read!,"This is a beautifully written work of art. It is literally the best civil war novel I have ever picked up. I felt emotionally tied to the characters; I laughed with them, I cried with them and I was truly saddened when the book came to an end. This novel is an excellent depiction of the heartbreaking cruelties of war and loss. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a moving story that will leave you forever touched by its characters."
4,Good,I enjoyed this Anime collection. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
5,Unique and Full of Ideas,"I feel guilty for not donating this book to my public library! Cathy Yow has filled this work with beautiful illustrations and fantastic ideas for unique, one of a kind pieces that reflect the abundance of nature. She even includes instructions for making jewelry from ten bean soup mix! Instructions are simple and easy to understand, even for the beginner. Standard jewelry making tools are used for most projects. A drill or dremel is required for many. An absolute treasure to own and a highly valuable book for those who sell their jewelry and want to offer something out of the ordinary."
1,Don't buy it unless you are a collector,This album is horrible as well as the art work did not know this album existed just can't get into their music now at 36 as i did when I was 18
1,What happened??,"I'll have to strongly disagree with the other reviewers on this album. While Battlehymns wasn't the greatest metal album ever, it did show a lot of promise for things to come. Unfortunately, this album let me down BIG TIME !! This is one of only two Manowar albums I don't like (Hail to England is the other one.) The songs are chaotic and fail to convey any sort of feeling whatsoever. Listening to this album you get the feeling someone told them they had a week to put their next album together and this is what happened. About the only thing positive about this disaster is that it shows Manowar slowly slipping into their own groove, with songs like Gates of Valhalla and March for Revenge. The lyrics are already at true Manowar ability but the music is a poor excuse for musicianship. If you're looking for true glory, keep riding!"
2,GOOD METAL,"THis album is good, but the guys in MANOWAR are so arrogant that it's hard to not let this fact influence your analysis of the album... The cover art is so silly that it makes me laugh. The so much praised ""Lyrics"" about glory and war are absurd, juvenile,.... In terms of music, tha songs are cool. But deniftely not ""the definitive example of metal"". For that, look for Black Sabbath's first album. MANOWAR seems like high-school students full of testosterone trying to show people how loud they can play. So what?"
3,Sister Act,"Cell Mates was another one of the ""too tough for pop"" rocker chick groups that seemed to be everywhere in the first couple years of the `90s. Like similar artists Saraya, Harlow, Chrissy Steele, Robin Beck, Skew Siskin, and Vixen, Cell Mates' music was pretty straightforward rock & roll that bordered on being AOR. What set the band apart was that it was fronted by attractive twin sisters (Pamela and Paula Mattioli, formerly of Gypsy Queen) who appeared to be all over each other. Something tells me this gimmick would not have gone over as well if Nelson had tried it.Gimmicks aside, there really isn't anything to set Cell Mates apart from the rest of the pack. Between Two Fires is a pretty basic rock album, and is a bit uneven. The vocals are tough without sounding overly raspy, and seem well suited to this type of music. It is worth picking up if you're into this kind of music, but it's not an album that will ever be considered a ""must-have."""
3,DEFECTIVE,"I WAS TRYING TO INSTALL THEM COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, ONE OF THEM WAS DEFECTIVE,,,I BOUGHT THEM AND I DIDNT HAVE TIME TO INSTALL THEM, I THOUGHT THAT IF YOU BUY AC DELCO YOU WAS BUYING THE BEST....NOW I HAVE TO BUY ONE AGAING BECAUSE I WAITED SO LONG TO CHECK THEM....OPEN YOUR BOX AND CHECK IF THEY ARE OK."
2,What the hell is this!,What's got into Stone Cold? What's the cameraman got to do with him? Matches are OK. But the presentation is yucky.
3,Really Stone Cold,"This video is not too bad. It features highlights from the period of Stone Cold Steve Austin's career spanning from his King of the Ring win in 1996 to the end of 1997; in other words, the time when he really was ""Stone Cold"". It's a passable way to spend some time, the only problem is, like everything Austin, it does get a bit predictable after a while."
2,This tape wasn't very good,This tape has clips from 1996 and 1997 and it is soooooooo old. Austin only wins about half the matches he's in. There is also too much clips of him just talking. They showed a third of the of Austin losing to Bret Hart. Besides that the rest of the video clips are good.
4,Excellent,this is a must have for all stone cold steve austin fans. it has his famous i quit match in its entirity. his commentary is great.
4,"Stone Cold, heh","This is the start of it. narrarated by stone cold himself, this has alot more wrestling in it then some of the other SC videos."
3,NOT GOOD,"the 1st guy who rated this movie must have only seen this anime, because its not that good. First of all, its not even an hour long. 2nd the animation is ok at best. The movie is sorta good though, because therre is violence and blood and the bad chick gets naked a the drop of a hat, which is fine in my book. The story is ok I guess, but i have one rule, NINJA SHOULDNT HAVE WINGS. I suggest that this guy should rent Ninja Scroll and then change this review."
5,Extremely Rare,If you can find this cd anywhere you need to pick it up! It got stolen from me about 5 years ago and i still cant find the damn thing! It came out before Royal Highness and all the tracks appear on Hidden Stash except for Bump. Pick it up if you can and score me a copy too!!!!
5,This is da bomb!,"Kottonmouth Kings truly brings a new definition to this genre, you gotta love their strong music!Lotza hugz, GothAngel"
3,Sirens Cry draws you in,"An intriguing and delicious mystery where we start at the end and go back to the beginning to pick up the clues, and while we think we are reading a thriller we are really reading a scholarly and informative book about Hollywood and the nuts and bolts of its dream machine.reader: Pamela O'Hagan"
4,The Cry of Sirens,"If you're expecting the usual Hollywood trash novel, you're going to be disappointed. ""The Cry of Sirens"" by William Kronick provides plenty of inside dope on the bizarre workings of the movie business, but this is just one of the elements that makes this book such a compelling read. The plot centers around a murder committed by the novel's protagonist, film director Ben Cameron. Ben's gotten away with the crime -- literally -- except in his own mind. Haunted by conscience, he struggles to find justification for his terrible act. The author uses Cameron's painful self-exploration as the dramatic device to tell his intriguing story. The writing throughout is crisp and clear as Kronick seamlessly blends murder, morality, politics and aesthetics into a novel that will keep you riveted to the end."
4,Worth Reading...,"I've hunted Turkey for many years and I'm always looking for something new or more to improve my hunts. I think You will find something in ""How To Turkey Hunt"" as did..good read!!"
2,If You've Never Done It....,"Even if you have never been turkey hunting, I am not sure that this is the place to start. There are a few good hints and tips, but much better information than what is provided in this book can be found all over the internet. The picture quality was poor, some of the advice was questionable, and the writing style wasn't highly entertaining. There has got to be a better How To book out there on the subject of turkey hunting."
2,Opened,"I received this opened, in a box but there was no plastic seal. I thought it was supposed to be new?!"
2,Not worth it,"This is almost like a body spray, the scent disappears within an hour or so. I wouldn't purchase it again."
5,Always a hit,Happy is my wife's favorite and I really like it too. Definitely a winner for me. Pricing here was good and the convenience of online ordering is great.
2,Happy?,"I ordered the large size Happy fragrance by Clinique. This is not the first time I order this product online, but this time I'm far from being satisfied with it. It arrived in what seems to be the original box, unopened, however the product itself does not smell like the original. The sent resembles the original Happy fragrance, but does not smell exactly like it. Missing all the nice citrus notes. I also received a Happy miniature from a different vendor in the same order, which smells like it suppose to, but the large size is a far cry from it. I've been using Happy ever since it came out in 1998, and this is the first time I had a product that didn't meet the standard. Its disappointing. I should've returned it if I wasn't so busy lately. Now I'm just using it as is, but not ""Happily""."
1,Item not authentic,"I bought this perfume for a friend of mine this year. She compared it with her old stock perfume with exactly the same type/brand. Our first impression was the same, this item is an imitation."
3,Not happy,"Not very happy with this perfume, doesn't last long at all and I've purchased this in department stores before and the smell lingered all day but not this bottle and it smells slightly different for some reason."
4,It's cheeper at the department store.,"Great fragrance, especially if you like something light and refreshing. Just buy it at the department store... it's sold for $49.50 at Clinique counters."
2,Beautiful smell but...................,"I have no idea what the heck is in this but its a wonderful scent at first then the dry down bottom notes turn gastly againt the wearer! My husband even noticed this...........he rarely says anything about what perfume I ware becasue he pretty much loves everything I ware but this wonderful scent has a hidden enemy in it almost like Tom Fords Black Orchid-its a love hate relationship! Maybe the enemy does not attack all warers but it did me and I never wore this again because of that. At first this scent is the most gorgous smell ive ever smelled, than after that, run for cover."
2,Its almost a sin to watch this,"Based on the PC game, Sin is the story of Blade who helps a girl. This movie looked really good, but then came the defaults. First off, the guy known as JC dies and is then replaced with his sister uncleverly named JC. Then the CG. The CG isn't horrible like Panzer Dragoon, but I can tell these guys weren't taking notes on the CG in Cowboy Bebop or Blue Sub No. 6. Even the 2D animation is horrible. And then theres the story. The story goes fairly well until the ending. This is the worst ending I have ever scene in an anime and I've seen a lot. The only reason I gave Sin 2 stars instead of one is for the dub, which brilliantly done, but doesn't make up for the laging story and bad animation. Fans of the PC game might get a mild kick out of it, but otaku won't. Avoid this one like the plaque."
2,This is an OK anime,"This is like most anime, sex and violence. It is a fairly good movie, it has some cursing, but not that much. I do not think you should buy it, but if you are intrested, JUST rent it. This should not be recomended for kids under 15."
1,this doesn't deserve a star,"This anime is horrible. Everything about it is just irritating, the animation, the characters, the story, and everything else in the movie has me at a loss for words. Do not buy this anime, I don't care if a friend lones it to you don't waste your time on it. Completely worthless!"
3,Doesn't leave you time to think,"Summary: good guy tries to stop evil scientist's mutants. The main feature of Sin was gore and violence. There was a clear plot to the film but constant killing and destruction forces that to the back of your mind, making you focus in a visual aspects. After watching you wish I wish I had known more about most of the characters backgrounds (especially the little girl who everyone wanted to capture). If only ADV extended 30 minutes to provide the information, to give the characters more personality instead of portraying them as either cruel, innocent, strong and/or rebelious, this movie would have much more appeal I give it a 3."
5,It's ok to like Sin,"Sin: The Movie is one of the only anime that not only lives up to the hype surrounding its release, but surpasses it. This movie is filled with non-stop action, drama, intrigue, and suspense. The characters are fantastically portrayed and so *real*. This is easily a 5 star anime. I highly recommend buying it and adding it to your collection."
3,disapointing,"This movie makes me mad, not so much because it was bad but because I'd expected it to be so much better, Sin was one of the best games ever made and I would easily throw $10 into it a week so I really expected it this to be a good movie, and it could haqve been, but they condensed it all into 53 minutes when it should have taken a bare minimum 2 hours, not only that but they sacrificed the story line for a bunch of shoot 'em up scenes of it got really confusing, however the action scenes weren't bad at all, and if that's all you're looking for I'd recomend this for you."
5,Sin: The Movie,"This is not a bad anime, the only thing is that it's too short. It would be nice if it could be a little longer, considering its based on a video game. But I thought it was good."
1,"Don't waste your time or money, keep shopping.","Go on folks, nothing to see here. The animation is losey and the characters are weak. I've never seen choppier animetion and hope I never do again. It's like they tried to rush job the ending to get it over with and really leaves the audience upset. There is also, which destroys a lot of anime, a lack of explanation to some things and throws you off even more. Do yourself a favor and move on to the next. Sin is exactly that. Spend 25 bucks on something better."
1,Mrs. Jan,"I bought Vtech 2.4GHZ Model#2435 during Thanksgiving sales, It stopped working after two weeks, both hand set are new batteries, then I put then away, now my sony phone needs a new battery, I have been thinking to give another try about this phone, then I bought another two pack of batteries, it won't work either.O.K, I am so mad and try to call the customer service, number is 18005959511, Guess what? I am always in que 3, finally I hear some people talking to me, just a short 'Hi"", then I am back to Que 3 again, that is it!!!Vtech phone #2435 is just a JUNK!!! Services are JUNK too."
2,Main Charger Fails To Charge,"I bought this same 2 phone system 2 years ago. Found after a few months that it failed to charge the hand set on the main phone. So I have to swap phones every so often to the remote phone's charger to keep them usable. At least they still work, for a cheap set, but V tech needs to fix the charging problem that is obviously a design or materials flaw."
5,Great phone,We have had this phone for over 6 months now and it is still doing a great job. One of the phones is in our home office and the other is in our garage. Reception is great on both.
2,Not really useful,I didn't find any power gain or mileage gain noticeable. Everything seems the same way it was before I put it on.
2,It looks good,"This product is very well constructed. The machining is very well done, but thats as far as the good comments go.Before installing this item, I was getting 14.9-15.4 MPG, after installing it, I dropped to 12.9-13.4. I immediately removed it and sent it back.Its a waste of time to install for a performance gain."
1,very poor quality,"I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves. The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3(count them - 3) wearings, the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open. The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby. I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I can't return them. I had originally planned to purchase 3 pairs of leather gloves (great color choices) Now I'm glad I only lost money on one pair. Regretfully, I would not consider future purchases from Fratelli Orsini."
2,I'll Never Buy and Epson Again,"I bought this printer to so I'd have an all in one and save the desk space and I really regret getting rid of my old Canon scanner and HP printer.The old canon scanned with one press of a button, this one takes a few too many steps and the scanning interface isn't as friendly as canon'sI am constantly running out of ink, this Epson has the shortest ink life I've ever seen in a printer. And when one color runs out, the printer won't work at all. It is very frustrating. And getting to be very expensive. I will likely bite the bullet and buy a new printer soon, just because it will likely save me in the long run, considering the high cost of keeping this one in ink."
1,Ink ripoff - just too much,"Yup, if it wasn't for the ink glitch, I will be giving it better...Because of it, this product doesn't even deserve to have one star!"
4,Now works with Macs,"Download the *FREE* Gutenprint5 (formerly Gimp Print) and follow the installation directions and you'll be printing in no time (but still not scanning. Oh well.)Colors are very nice, speed is good, no comment on ink usage yet but generics are available online."
2,Poor photo print quality,"This printer is a good buy for office work but NOT for photographs.Have not used the scanner. Copier works fine but I did not like the print quality of any photos printed from PC files, memory card or even photo-copied.Basically. this printer seems fine for documents and document type prints but not for glossy photographs. The pictures are grainy and show the dots. The ink colors on my prints were good but could have been better. Using the special Epson papers, my photographs were still not good due to the graininess. My digital camera is a Canon-7MP so my pictures are good to begin with."
2,"SLOW, expensive ink, but good quality","The print quality is good on this machines, it just takes forever to print something. When you turn it on and try to print something it takes a least a full minute maybe longer to warm up before it even starts printing. If you are printing a detailed color job, it then takes a long time to print. For simple black ink jobs, once it is warmed up it is pretty quick. No wireless printing capabilities built in, and difficult to install the drivers if you don't have the disk.The thing I dislike the most is that the ink is really expensive, and you are not able to refill cartridges, you have to buy new every time. I would recommend a different printer.My next choice of printers will be something like theBrother Printer Wireless Monochrome Printer, Dark Grey (HL2280DW). For a comparable price you can get a laser printer, which means it will be way faster, and have wireless networking capabilities."
2,Paper doesn't feed properly,A fine printer- if you don't mind constantly standing over it and sheperding each page of paper into the machine. The automatic feeding works very poorly.
1,Extremely Slow,"I do not recommend this printer to anyone. The speed is extremely slow. The advertised 20 pages or so per minute in black ink on draft mode is really misleading in my opinion because it does not provide a measurement of how fast it will print at a normal resolution.The draft mode printout is very dotty and light, and is not really suitable for anything in my opinion. The next level of print quality (there are 5 levels) takes very long. I think it took about 40 seconds or longer to print a color page. For this reason alone, I give the printer 1 star rating.I personally like the Epson brand and strongly recommend purchasing the next model up, which is the CX4800.I was lucky enought to have a store that was willing to make the exchange without a restocking fee. I am pleased with the CX4800 and it is worth the additional money."
2,not very efficient,We've had this printer for almost 2 years. The scanner works great I can't complain about that. The ink is expensive and if you try to refill the cartriges the printer prints out lines and does weird stuff. The paper feeder is horrible. It can't sense where the paper is very good and just makes a really loud noise until you move the paper to a perfect spot. This printer is annoying.
2,"awful product, worse customer support","I have had nothing but trouble with epson all-in-one, save the first couple months after purchase. Photo printing has always been marginal, but recently I purchased ink cartridges from epson, and now the colors will not print. I have done everything they recommend, and sadly I have been left to an answer of ""we are sorry this happened."" That does not give me any faith in Epson nor the products they sell. Never again will I buy from Epson."
3,"slow as heck, really big in size, but good price","you pretty much get what you pay for with this cx3810. software is great because you can choose to only install the printer's drivers, and not all the bloated propietary software that comes on the disc. easy to set up, easy to use. but it does print SLOW. so if speed if a necessity, dont buy this printer. and the copy function is only 1 copy a time, meaning u have to press the button each time you want to make 1 copy. so its fine if you want 1 copy, but would probably get annoying if you wanted 10 copies of something. print quality is good, scanning is fine. and the size is nearly ginormous. i had an hp 1210 that was like 5 years old and it was smaller than this behemoth."
1,ink costs are entirely unacceptable,"I cannot believe how quickly this ran out of ink. This is a printer that I simply cannot afford to use. My next printer will not be an Epson. The print quality is ok - nothing to comment on either way, really. But, having paid for this printer, I am going to replace it with another one, because I just can't afford this."
5,great printer for the money,I have had this printer for 8 years and has always worked great it just died and I am happy that I am able to purchase one here on this site and I can't wait till it gets here as one was not available locally for me. Mine did not use a lot of ink either. I have recommended this printer to all my friends who went out bought it and they also love it.
2,"Fine, when it allows you to print","We've been pretty happy with the scanning on this printer, and the printing, when it allows you to do so. We've done photos and documents and, to my untrained eye, they all look pretty good. However, like other users, I find that I simply am unable to print when, for example, I am out of cyan ink and I simply want to print a black and white document. I feel terrible because this is only about a year old, but we're going to have to throw it out. I just can't deal with being bossed around by my printer.Haven't used it as a fax machine, so I can't comment on that aspect."
2,I love it except...,"I love everything about my Epson CX 3810 printer except just a couple things.1. It will not scan text and convert them to word documents. It makes a picture of everything. Great for photos and creating pdf files, but not so great when you need to scan a text document and edit it.2. It flies through the ink. I've bought two replacement black cartridges and one each of all the colors in the last six months. That adds up to roughly $100 and I've printed less than three reams of paper. My old lexmark is more economical."
3,Black and white printing issues,"I received this printer as a Christmas gift a few years ago. It was working well until a few months ago. Color output and web printing works fine, but when I try to print a document in just black and white, there are gaps and text is missing. I'm going to try and leave the printer off for a few days to see if the hardened ink softens. If anyone has any tips or assistance, please feel free to contact me. I cleaned the nozzle several times, but went through so much ink that I had to purchase another ink cartridge. Customer service at Epson is average. This is my first Epson and my first issues with one of their products. Usually I buy HP printers."
1,mac users don't bother...,"Does not work for the Mac! Can you believe that, neither could I until I contacted Epson and received the reply that it is indeed not compatible. Is it really that hard for dual platform use production. Im guessing this was designed in the early 90's and usb technology was just coming out. Mac users beware."
1,Still have not received it yet!!!,I paid extra for expedited shipping...and I still have not received the printer that I ordered!!!Corrine
2,spend a little bit more,"For a few bucks more you can get a decent 3 in 1 from HP that will probably work better than this. I thought it was cool that instead of one multi-colored print cartridge (cyan, yellow, & magenta) it had separate cart's, but the down side is that they don't hold much ink and when you run out of one color you are done printing until you replace it (i.e. if you're out of yellow, you can't print a black text document). There are 2 things that really bother me.1. I wanted to be able to scan a page of text and import it into a word processing program, but according to Epson's tech support, you can't do it unless you purchase additional 3rd party sofware...my old HP would scan into MS Word right out of the box.2. The fast print/low quality mode is SO fast and SO low quality that it's basically useless and I have to print even the most minor temporary prints in higher quality (using more ink which I have to replace more often)."
3,"501 Reading Comprehension Questions, 3rd Edition (Skill Builders in Practice)","this book miss some page. it is Different from I was required in my class. For some my homework, I could not to do because it missed a chapter."
4,Ugly Gorillas Go Away!,"""Amy, pretty gorilla!"" A talking monkey named Amy knows sign language and her mentor wants to take her back home to the Congo in Africa. Watch it 'chica' for the lady who wants to find her ex-fiancee, watch out for the 'Great White Hunter' who isn't white, and the dude who calls himself Herkermer Homolka. All of these people travel together and they encounter a general who commands Homolka to stop eating his sesame cake. ""He's a big, bag of stuff!"" Yes. They go skydiving and fight a hippo. Oh yeah, remember the ugly gorillas who throw heads and eat all kinds of stuff. You have to witness the ugly gorillas jump into the lava from the erupting volcano, it's hilarity to the maximum. Good movie."
3,"No comparison to the book, but campy fun on its own merits","When a motley crew of scientists, adventurers, treasure hunters, plus a primatologist and his ape, Amy, trek through the Congo in search of the Lost City of Xinj, they discover the legendary King Solomon's Mines. Unfortunately, they have to get through a wall of muscle in the form of an aggressive, specially-bred strain of gorilla guards to get to the diamonds. It's up to the uber-educated Amy (never portrayed by a real primate) to try and use brains over brawn as the greedy group gets torn limb from limb. Look for an especially hammy turn by Tim Curry as a Russian-accented (or is it Romanian?) snake in the grass named Herkermer Homolka (say that three times fast). Based upon a novel by Michael Crichton.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Geez,"Rarely have I been so dissapointed by a book to film transfer. The movie does everything in its power to betray the genius of the book, from introducing new and unimportant characters to a complete reworking and butchering of the main character, a.k.a, the mission and purpose of the movie. The man that made this, and thought it was an improvement on the book should be dragged out in the street and beaten many, many times."
1,Oh Gosh! How I agree with that viewer saying TERRIBLE!,"I DIDN'T GET IT AT ALL! I never could say that I haven't seen a movie I hated; until this one! Monkeys running loose, eyeballs popping out; just too much inhospitable filmaking and behavior in this movie. What's the point? However there was one good part; when the credits at the end started going up indicating that this junk is OVER!"
2,Con-Don't Go,"This movie stinks feet.Horrible writing,lousy acting and worst of all,cruddy directing.The ape suits are so bad and cheap they make Roddy Mcdowall look like a endangered species.The 1933 King Kong looked more convincing then the ones in this bullflop.Tim Curry's Romanian accent in this film is hilarious and there should have been a laugh track everything he talked.The only ""cool"" things in the movie are Bruce Campbell,Ernie Hudson and the ape-zapper laser gun but it's still not worth it in the long-run.The special effects are just stupid and it's cornballish storylines are just silly & laughable.I give this film a 3 out of 10."
3,"Campy ,Yet Fun","Ok, this movie was not that bad. As a sci-fi film it is preposterous, but as an Indiana Jones-like adventure film, I thought it was quite fun. (It had Bruce Campbell in it, so you know it's going to be campy.)The worst thing about it was the trailers; (VHS version) they were downright embarrassing! Imagine recommending a movie to rent as a good action flick only to press play and see: 1) A schlocky Pepsi commercial featuring a child who (thankfully) does not appear in the film, and 2)a commercial for some gawd awful low budget kids' show that makes Power Rangers look cutting edge. This is not a kids' movie; why were they advertizing things that only a 5 year old would want to watch?So rent the movie if you're hanging out with some friends, but please, skip the trailers!"
4,Hello??? Its a MOOOVIE,"Apparently the people who reviewed this before me wanted this film to be the next Titanic or something and win millions of Oscars. Well it wont and i like it even better that way.If you can believe that it really is a baby gorilla that can sign and there are killer Albino Gorillas then you will like this movie just fine. Cameos by Delroy Lindo and Joe Pantoliano are very enjoyable to watch. Also notable, is the fine performance by the underrated Ernie Hudson. He is joined by his OZ costar Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Also along for the ride is Oscar nominee Laura Linney.Lighten up and enjoy a good adventure flick with a few thrills thrown in. Besides it is a Michael Crichton movie it has to be good!"
1,One Of The Worst Movies Ever!,"This movie looked and felted like it took about three days to put together. Apes that you don't even see until the last ten minutes of the movie leave bloody trails of uncharismatic actors. This film was a HUGE disappointment. If you have any copies in your house, I suggest you throw them out immediately before you get any dumber."
5,Enjoyable,"I actually loved this movie. Funny, I have read the terrible reviews and I don't agree with them at all. I must have watched it a dozen times, and found it a fast paced, exciting watch that is just as enjoyable the 12th time as it was the first."
1,I agree with the amazon review,"Pretty bad that even the company that sells this movie agrees with me...this has my vote as worst movie I've ever seen...hell, at least Plan Nine from Outer Space was fun to poke fun at...this is just...torture!"
3,Before Python there was Congo,"Made way back in 1995. A horror story about a lost city and killer gorillas. A research team is slaughtered by some unknown creature will locking for a dimon to power a laser. Design for communication. She goes on a quest across the africian border to retrive it.What she things is an ancient legendary city and killer gorilas. Can the survive and get off the island. Before the volcano errupts.If you like Congo I also recomend Raptor, Python, Phyton 2, Anadaconda."
2,Not enough Monkey Business!,"Everybody say CONGO is a film about scientists find killer gorillas in th rain forest. This is true, but before we get to the psycho monkeys, we have to sit trough hostile militants, the Hungry Hungry Hippos in their cruel retirement, and guys who just get this occasional urge to shoot planes out of the sky with seeker rockets that thwarted with flare guns. The killer gorillas show up in the first five minutes to kill Bruce Campbell (dang you monkeys!) and disappear until the last twenty minutes or so. And this film is 110 minutes.Well, I guess I can't get too angry at CONGO, it at least has decent effect and a few cool action sequences. Those are really the only two good things I can say about this borefest. Stay away unless your a Michael Chritchon completest."
2,Congo goes absolutely Wrongo,"A lot of talented people went wrong with this movie. The director is Frank Marshall,who directed Arachnophobia. That movie had genuine suspense and lots of laughs. Congo has neither, except for a few unintentional ones(Tim Curry's accent is unbelievably bad.) The effects person, Stan Winston, is one of the most talented in Hollywood, but his gorillas look just like what they are-men in monkey suits. It takes forever to get to them, and their first appearance is done with one of the most poorly shot and laughable slo-mo scenes ever done for a movie. The composer, Jerry Goldsmith, is one of my favorite movie musicians, but his bongo drums and African chant score is distracting and annoying. The violence is very bloody and brutal for a PG-13movie. In fact, the only reason I'm giving this two stars is the beautiful African setting. Avoid Congo."
1,Congo Schmongo,"If monkeys can be trained to do almost anything, do you think they could have written a better script than this schlockly B-movie-style rubbish? Although it's based on another Michael Crichton mega-seller, it borrows heavily from classics like Lost Horizon and King Kong. But woe is us.Despite some breathtaking photography (most of it, by the way, taken in the deepest, darkest reaches of California) filmmakers have only succeeded in making the best 1940s film of 1995. Be very afraid of Congo. When guys in gorilla suits meet laser technology, the result is, in this sorry case, nothing short of banana-brained."
1,"Hilarious...! Oh wait, I'm told it's NOT a comedy!","The very beginning is really quite impressive with the technological wizardry they use, but within 5 minutes the dialogue will have you in stitches. It's so badly written!!! The apes look phony and it's an incredible waste of good actors (Ernie Hudson and Tim Curry who have since registered their embarrassment about making this disaster). Amazing it made as much money as it did at the box office! (Go figure.) Deserves the Razzie Award for the Worst Movie of The Decade!"
3,Shame on those zipped up imitators,"A pale remake of so many films or books about the Mines of King Solomon, the lost valley and the wild African nature that has no real existence except in our phantasms. So the film is just a poor piece of entertainment in which everything is so artificial that we see the zippers on the four sides of all the gorillas. I just wonder if the human beings are not the same with four zippers, one on each side. That's what modern technology and digitalized 3D virtual reality is producing day after day and they just edit it into a long feature and they call it a film. One more miracle of that modern age.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
2,Decent enough film,"This film story-wise isn't that great or particularly interesting. It has its moments though, especially with Tim Curry in it. I enjoy Laura Linney's work alot so I certainly don't mind watching this film a few more times if just to watch her. I suppose its mildly entertaining, in parts, though the ending was a bit stupid and completely unrealistic."
3,beautiful scenery...,"No, it's not a good movie, but the scenery and production design is inventive, exotic and invigorating! But then again, I'm prejudiced. J. Michael Riva, the production designer, used my travelogue, ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made"" as a research tool for the film!"
4,"Nothing like ""Jurassic Park"", but good","Many people compare ""Congo"" to ""Jurassic Park"" because both are adaptations from books by the same author, Michael Crichton. However, the two movies are nothing alike in any way. While ""Jurassic Park"" is about man vs. dinosaurs, ""Congo"" is about a talking gorilla and a few people that go on an expedition to the Congo of Africa to find diamonds that are good enough to function as a laser weapon. The explorers are unaware of it, but they'll have to survive a few twists and turns along the way.I thought ""Congo"" was a pretty good movie although parts of it are predictable. I was real impressed with some of the special effects toward the end of the movie. Luckily, it should be interesting enough to keep you from getting bored while watching it, so I recommend giving it a try."
3,It wasn't THAT bad!,"It was some what entertaining at least. But the only reason I watched it was because my favorite actor, Tim Curry, was in this. But he didn't make the movie better at all. I hate when they have Tim Curry do some other accent that sounds like crap. Only good when action fans have nothing better to watch. This is one film I actually don't recommend. If you have any questions or comments on my review please e-mail."
1,Pure stupidity,"This is a complete waste of time to watch. First of all it drags WAY too much, is uninvolving and often boring. Do your brain a favor and stay clear."
2,"Stupid, boring film - 4.5 out of 10","This film sucks. Almost in a good way, but right when it heats up to hilarious or exciting, it cops out and turns lame again. Ernie Hudson is a good action protagonist, but the filmmakers give the film to some boring and annoying gorilla trainer. Laura Linney is her usual stern and unlikable self. Bruce Campbell has a tiny, but vital part... why didn't they cast him as the trainer? Tim Curry is really great with some of the hammiest acting of his later career.The evil gorillas could have been way better but are kinda creepy at parts. The ridiculous volcano ending is hilariously bad. Overall, this could have been a very good ""Jurassic Park"" ripoff, but ends up an embarrasment."
1,Movie ordered,I have never received the item they charged me for! I emailed them and no response either.....
1,one of michael crichton's worst books becomes a very very bad movie!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!! NOT EVEN ONE GOOD SCENE IN THIS HUGE MESS ABOUT DIAMONDS ,KILLER APES,AND GREED! EVERYONE INVOLVED WITH THIS SHOULD SAY THEIR SORRY!!!! THE PITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SKIP THIS TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"""Stop eating my sesame cakes""","Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry) has been looking for the Lost City of Zinj. He is contemplating picking up a few souvenirs when he finds it. Seems that the only one that has been there is Amy (Misty Rosas). However Amy needs to go home. Her buddy and mentor is economically taped out. So they all team up with a Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney) who just happens to be going in that direction and can afford the travel arrangements. While Karen thinks she is going to save fellow explorer, her boss also has a nefarious plan.Will Amy go home?Will Karen find her friend ""alive""?Does the boss's plan come to fruition?Will Herkermer Homolka get his trinkets or his fingers Zinj'd?What secret does the lost city hold?Let's face it Tim Curry makes the movie. Not only doe he excels in his character but allows others to play off him. Otherwise this would just be a run of the mill misadventure film. Great accent.Oscar Staring Tim Curry as Dr. Thornton Poole"
5,awesome dvd,dvd came as expected seller was very honest it WAS in excellent condition appreciate honesty would buy from again..many thanks
3,It's Extremely Mediocre.,"A group of explorers is looking for the Lost City of Zinj. They are not alone in the Congo though. There is a tribe of vicious man eating apes watching them and protecting the Lost City. They soon clash, and a battle for survival begins.There isn't a lot to say about this movie. It lacked just about everything that a movie needs to make it great. Even so, it is an entertaining watch. I wouldn't go so far as to buy it, but if you're bored and at home on a Saturday night; go rent it and it may hold you over until Sunday."
3,missed opportunities.,"Bruce Campbell and Tim Curry in the same movie? A movie addict's dream? Not anywhere near it. More like a waste of two great talents, as well a squandering of Michael Crichton fun thriller, though Curry is giggle as OTT Herkermer Homolka (in a role originally going to Ian Ogilvy). Wasted is the whole premise of what the apes were, how they got there; they are just big bad ape monsters protecting diamonds for who know why.Nice popcorn movie if there isn't something better to watch...like Abbott and Costello Meet Dracula!"
3,enjoyable Saturday-afternoon jungle adventure serial,"This movie is trash, but I still like it. When Bruce Campbell turns toward the screen and screams early in the movie, I realized that they would be staying true to the ""Jungle Jim"" roots of this genre, and I wasn't disappointed. If you liked ""Tarzan and the Leopard People"" (I think that's the name) and could stand the ""Bomba the Jungle Boy"" shows, then this could be a movie for you.If you plan to take it seriously (even at the level of something like ""Romancing the Stone""), you will hate it."
4,Good Fun,Forget the comparisons to art. Art this is not. Entertainment it is. And Mr. Curry is worth the price of admission.
2,Disappointing Movie After Reading the Book.,"This movie could have been so much better if they had taken a little more from the book.I enjoyed the idea of the 'glove' that allows the gorilla who can sign, to speak. I didn't enjoy the ex CIA operative who, ""put's them on the endangered species list"". When I saw this movie at the theater, I was quite annoyed that I had spent so much money to watch what must have been a slap in the face for Crichton.Crichton is well known for using science to make his stories believable, but all the science in the world couldn't take care of what they did to his book. Try renting this one before you buy, and if you like it, by all means read the book. You won't be disappointed."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"I had high hopes for this film when it first came out but the result is a complete waste of time.The Actors look like they really dont want to be there and the ""Gorilla"" is totally unbelievable. To make matters worse, halfway through the film they seem to throw in some pointless special effects which although very pretty ( I think they were done by ILM ) serve no purpose.Avoid this one or you'll stink up your dvd player"
5,The myth of the killer ape,I really liked this movie and thought it was a great adventure film. In a way it is kind of like the movie Anaconda only with killer gorillas instead of snakes.
3,a good film based on a good book,"I notice that anytime a movie comes along that is based on a book, the critics tend to bash it to no end. Congo is no exception though as usual, I normally tend to disagree with film critics. Granted, I have seen many movies that don't include as much as the books they are based on though none of the ones I have seen fell short of entertaining. As for Congo, I enjoyed it for the most part. The story was well writen with some good thrills and humor. The characters were likeable and well acted by the way. The special puppeteering effects for the gorilla were amazing! At first, I honestly thought that Amy was a real gorilla. Regarding the film itself, it seemed a bit rushed in some ways and the ending was a bit brief. Still, this does not take away from the entertainment value of Congo. As for the dvd, there are no features to speak of which is somewhat unfortunate yet typical with paramount dvds."
1,THE WORST FILM EVER MADE,"(...) This film is terrible-it is in fact, in my opinion, the worst film ever made.The reason for this is simple-it could have been so good. A brilliantly entertaining novel by Michael Crichtion as the foundation, Marshall-a Spielberg producer and protege of sorts, coming off the recent success of telling a good story with ""Alive""- the photography of Allen Daviau-these three men should have at least garunteed a halfway decent film. But of course not.(...) perhaps be as good as Jurassic Park was in theatres. How wrong I was.The only people who deserve credit on this film are Paramount's advertisement people who managed to put together 30 second spots that actually made it look like the film had a chance.(...) Some films (especially in the past two years) have come close, but none has been able to take this one off the mantel of the worst film ever made.Don't spend a dime on this."
2,This film is worse than the book,I read the book in highschool and enjoyed it somewhat. A few months later I rented the video and was upset at how bad it was. Outside of The Lost world this is the worst adaption of a Michael Crichton novel that I have ever seen. The only reason that I give it two stars is that if you haven't read the book you may actually like it.
4,I've used this book,"(...) My only complaint is the index--it would be better to include a magnifying glass rather than a CD so that the index would be usable. The publisher should have spent the extra penny and made the font size at least 8 points.Aside from that, this book is packed with useful information, and loaded with examples. If you know nothing about designing wizards, read this book, and you should have the confidence to get started. If you have experience designing wizards, this book will give you the tools you need to make great wizards that help users complete tasks easily. As a reviewer of interfaces, I found this book to be most helpful in answering questions like ""Should they be doing that?"" and ""Isn't there a better way to present those choices?"" I highly recommend this book."
1,don't buy this tool!!,"This strange looking weapon/tool does not work at all. It barely scratched the surface of our walpaper to score it. Actually it didnt even penetrate the paper at all my husband said. He ended up using the palm held scorer that we purchased years ago from Lowes. So, do yourself a favor and don't order this tool. I'm in the process of asking for a refund. I hope this was helpful.Jane,"
2,Not wortj the money.,"I bought this hoping it would help me take the border off the wall. it made the holes great but I wasnt able to get the border off very easy. Instead I used fabric softener and a coat steamer. That worked so much better. I put a little fabric softener on a sponge, coated the border or wall paper, then used the steamer to moisten the paper and was able topull th epaper off in one peice. Even where the paper pealed off and left the backing, all i did was go over it with the steamer and it came off very easy. Didnt need to malke the holes."
4,Good wall paper removal tool,"The tool is a little dangerous and even looks like a Middle Ages weapon. However, you can score a wall 5X's as fast as the little round tools they sell at Home Depot. Its hard to judge the depth of the holes with this, so you'll likely be forced to skim-coat after the paper is off. Its still worth it."
2,Does nothing for wallpaper.,"After breaking my second Paper Tiger, I decided to order this along with a few more Paper Tigers. This wall cover perforator does next to nothing to my twice painted wallpaper, which is all I have left. If the wallpaper weren't painted, the Paper Tigers wouldn't have broken. While this will probably not break from over use, it is also worthless to me. Eventually I'll find something useful for this tool, just not for wallpaper removal. So, save yourself some money and buy the Paper Tiger, and not one of its knock offs either. The triple head Paper Tiger is even better, lasts longer, but is more bulky and it is not depth limited."
2,dog treats,my dogs did not show any ecitement over this treat. not saying there is anything wrong with it my chihs just don't care for them.
3,cute lunchbox,"This lunch box is small so you cant fit alot of food in it, but its very cute. People always ask me where did i get it. But it does its job. So if you pack small lunches this would be perfect for you."
5,Great lunchbox!,"Fits about a sandwich, granola bar, and three bananas. Good for one lunch. Always gets remarks at work.:)"
4,Another Reader's Digest(ion).,"This is a good book for those that are just coming to explore the Ancient World of the Mediterranean. Rome came to dominate that world and influences us even today. It is not purely by acident that we have a Senate, and that many of the buildings in Washington, D. C. resemble Greco-Roman buildings, nor that we have a republican form of government. It all comes from and through Rome. This book will give the beginning explorer information that can stand as a beginning point to mark the beginning of the exploration of this ancient culture that still influences us today. But that is its limitation, too."
3,A lot like many other picture book histories,"What I specifically liked was some of the black marble sculptures picturedof the first Brutus.The book has the standard history of Rome with the Etruscans, and Carthage.Having read some recent history of Rome during the Caesars,I know that it glosses over a lot of detail,to just give an overview. Ancient Rome like ancient Egypt might be aplace to visit, but I doubt few modern people could stand to livethere."
5,Great way to build your vocabulary,"This book is formatted in a way that you can easily build your vocabulary one day at a time. The lessons build upon each other and provide the reader background information on the words being taught, making it easy to understand and remember the spelling and pronunciation."
5,word power made easy!!,"I read this book when i was student. I have advised my cousins and recently my wife who was preparing for a competitive exam to read this book with always very positive feedback.This book is best way to make 'words' your friend. etymology, roots, suffixes/prefixes are what this book is all about. But then the way book is written is perfect for readers(students :) ). Chapters are so written to introduce reader to a category (doctors/emotions/mania etc.) and learn words related to that category(and also based on roots you learn words based on same root). I have been grateful to this book which got me initiated with good and active vocabulary."
5,Sanchez's error,"There is a review below that states ""My husband recently bought ""30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary"" Unfortunely this thread is about WORD POWER MADE EASY. She gave THAT book one star but applied it here lowering this book's rating. Her other comments well...."
5,Impactful vocabulary learning tool...,This is a book that was used as a supplement in my high school English class. Throughout my life I have relied on the techniques included in this resource to decipher words. It's such a powerful tool that I am purchasing it for my nieces and nephews and I feel it should be a requirement for all students.
4,Another Great Tool for Vocabulary Building,"Whether you're in junior high school, high school, college or graduate school, you can find use for this book. Although, admittedly, its usefulness will likely diminish relative to your progression in formal education (at least we'd hope so). I have a myriad of vocabulary-building resources in my library and this one is not the least-used of them, but it's also not the most-used. I gave it four stars instead of three simply because I've noticed that the majority of people who borrow my vocabulary builders tend to find this one the most useful and easiest to navigate (they all use another piece of paper and I've left it unmarked so that it can be used over and over).It's a lot more comprehensive than most and I can't imagine that it will ever outlive its usefulness. Someday, it'll be old, worn out, falling apart and I'll likely still be urging my grandchildren to pick it up."
5,Excellent learning tool,"I had to make a decision over which book I wanted to buy to improve my vocabulary, and I had to choose from far more expensive books than this one. In the end, as I was skimming through this book, I saw how amazingly wonderful and entertaining the book is. I've only read the intro and done a few exercises, and believe me, it is so helpful. Don't be misled by other books with extravagant exteriors, in this case, really don't judge a book by it's cover. Although at first sight I didn't want to buy it because it simply didn't look as ""nice"" as the others, I'm glad I sat down and made that choice. You won't regret it."
4,Difficult book,"Just as other English grammar books, this is difficult to read.But very helpful and handy"
3,"Not bad, but Rosenblum is better","Not a bad book for the price, but very repetitive. For the same money one can buy a mnuch better book by Rosenblum"
2,Outdated and overly didactic feel,"Instead of a paced and breathable intro to greek and latin etymology, this book is over-ensembled with various activities, spelling bees, and multiple choice formats. It's a bit too muddled for me as definitions are mixed into paragraphs and several similar versions of the same word inundate the reviewer as well. Too stuffy and turgid for my taste. Better books cut the clutter and provide the clarity to more easily integrate our ancient english roots."
1,Dangerous Error,"My husband recently bought ""30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary"" and I casually opened it to a page at random. On p. 287, there is a ""test"" with a question which reads: Is a lecherous man a misogynist? True or false. Shockingly, the answer, in the book, is false. What a sad commentary on the author, the editors and all the ""positive"" reviewers that they think that a man given to excessive self-indulgence with women ""loves"" them when such obsessive behavior is antithetical to true love, in which the well-being of the loved person is paramount. Of course, lechery is a close cousin to physical abuse. And, that's the danger in this vocabulary error."
5,Best Book to Learn Vocabulary,"I purchased this book for my son now in his 1st year of college. I told him it's the way to expand his vocabulary. After two weeks I asked how he liked the book and he commented, ""It's the best way to learn vocabulary because it teaches you how to figure out what words mean."" I was not surprised. I had also bought a copy of it for myself since I felt the same when I initially went through its lessons 25 years ago as a college student myself. It's a classic, easy to read, and should be the first step to take. Thanks."
1,huggies diapers,was very disappointed in these diapers. more than 1/4 of the package ripped on the sides! i reported problem and found out that they are discontinued as well!
4,SUPER STARS GED,THIS BOOK HELP PEOPLE GET THAT CHANCE TO RECEIVED THAT SPECIAL GIFT THAT THEY RECEIVED IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT THEY ALWAY DREAM OF IN LIFE.
5,Grandma,"Holes in the floor of heaven was played at my grandmothers funeral in 97, The song realy has meaning to it . Exspecialy in my case ,because my grandmother lived and devoted her life for her grandchildren they was #1 in her life so the song really made sence to be played then as well as now . Thank-you for having the heart that god has gave you to beable to share not only this song but all your song."
5,This song is so moving(Holes in the Floor of Heaven),"A lady that I work with had a sister pass away from cancer a few months ago. This was her sisters favorite song and as they were pulling into her funeral service, this song was playing. She took that as a sign from her sister that she would be okay. I just think this song has a lot of meaning and heart to it. I just feel so strongly about this song because of the wave of emotion it sets out for people. I had never payed attention to the words of this song, until this story was told to me. So I am hoping by telling people this, they will realize how important loved ones really are."
2,Holes is very very BAD!!!,"There has never been a song that I truly hated with all my heart, but Holes in the Floor of Heaven has to take the gold here. It's depressing and is not the kind of song you want to hear on the radio!!! I can't believe it won all those awards!!"
4,Excellent reference book,"I used Online Law as a reference for my E-Commerce project at the community college. It covered all the important topics in great detail. The book is organized like a textbook, so it is easy to find the information you need. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in doing business on the Internet."
3,Strange,The miniseries strayed far from the novel. I was a bit confused and disappointed. The ending was really different from the book.
5,Beautiful historic film adaptation of a terrific epic novel,I loved the book and when I found that Eddie Redmayne was playing Jack I had to see the movie.
4,Pillars of the Earth Part 2,"Movie was entertaining although it gets bogged down in plots and sub plots on a few occasions. Amazing parallel with government of today. Provides a good commentary on the roles of government (monarchy) and the church in feudal times. Saddly as far as religion and politics are concerned, not much has changed between then and now. The crooks have been around forever. The battle scenes and torture sequences may not be suitable for young viewers or sensitive viewers."
3,Good enough.. But pales from the original,While this was cast with a good actors many characters didn't match my minds version. But it came close. If you've read the book you know how detailed the story is..something that would be very difficult to put into film. So it deviates from the original but all the main points are played out. NOTHING can match the brilliance of Follets work so you really must read the book.
4,Well made and complete,I found this was a very complete and well made dictionary for enochian ceremonial.
3,Decent Dictionary,"This book is just what it claims to be: a complete dictionary of the Enochian Language. Enochian is not really a language in the truest sense, but a cipher. There is an interesting essay at the beginning of the book, in which Laycock describes the origins of the Enochian Calls and the circumstances under which they were discovered by John Dee and Edward Kelly. It becomes rather hard to not believe that John Dee was merely the dupe of a con man (Kelly), but nevertheless, for anyone interested in the cipher or it's history, the book makes for interesting reading. Three stars because . . . well, a dictionary can only be so entertaining . . . most of the book is just a list of Enochian words with their tranlsations in English. Useful, but still a tad bit on the dull side. Still, it is scholarly, and will have obvious uses to practitioners of Enochian magick."
1,Hand Molded Figures by Roland A. Winbeckler,"I was utterly disappointed with the quality of the book. Definitely not a book for people who expected colours and quality pictures. For a 26 pages (that includes printing on both front and back cover) book, personally I don't think it is value for money."
2,Cute but basic,"I touhgt it would be a little more advanced as per the figures shown. Even some of them are cute, I think it should be directed to little kids or persons with no experience in modelling at all. I probably would have wanted to have more information on to what ages was this book directed to before buying it."
2,Modeling figures for cake decorating,"I was disappointed with the quality of the book, the illustrations were in black and white and most pictures were very washed-out making it difficult to see details. The center fold pictures were in color but the photography wasn't well done. The booklet was only 25 pages and appeared to be self published.It did have cute caricatures to model but they were lost in the poor photography."
2,"USB 1.1 is too slow, poor FM sound quality, average earbuds","It's USB 1.1, so loading songs is slow.There is a distinct sound quality difference between the radio and the MP3 player. The radio, being worse, is especially bad at capturing ""highs"". Since the EQ only works for the MP3 player, you can't tweak the radio sound.The tinny sounding TDK earbuds do actually make the radio sound OK. But do you really want to use your ""good"" headphones for the MP3 player and the TDK ones for the radio function?Also the FM tuner does not do well in pulling in stations in San Francisco (a tough environment).Otherwise it has reasonably good functionality. Good manual. Good software. Good user interface. Nice ergonomics."
3,Forget downloading from Napster,"I was quite impressed with this unit (small, attractive, good sound) until my husband and I tried to download some tunes from several commercial sites. Between the proprietary software and Windows Media Player not recognizing the USB connection we had to call TDK tech support for help. During the call, TDK broke the news that you can't download music from the commercial sites because of their built in protections -- you can really only ""rip"" tunes off of CDs or download from ""free"" sites. Since the idea of downloading music (rather than buying CDs) was the primary reason I bought the Mojo for my husband, this was an unpleasant surprise. It would have been nice to know the Mojo wasn't compatible before I bought it."
3,"Somwhat overpriced, made in china, OK surface",The first one arrived with a motor problem and the remote died within a week. The second one is fine but the battery inside the remote keeps getting loose and you need a screwdriver to fix it. The remote trigger is not compatible with standard 12V triggers found on most receivers and projectors. For the price it might still be OK for most.
1,"More bad vocals, more bad music, yup its Nocturne.","You would hope a band would grow with each release and sadly Nocturne is just as bad on this CD as their last. Nothing original here, at times the music can be ok but the vocals are just awful. I don't know what it is about this band but everything about their sound strikes me as a really bad ripoff, the music, production, mix are all poor and as I stated above the vocals are just horrid.To be fair, I have never been a fan of this type of rock music, I had got the release expecting something goth/industrial. Fans of Bon Jovi, Europe, Quiet Riot, Poison might like this, its only a step or two down for those types of bands."
1,Money Wasted,"Weak,generic,rehashed cookie cutter B.S.I can't believe I actually spent money on this.Well that's the last time I buy ANYTHING on a certain someones(who shall remain nameless)recomendation.Only two decent songs on this cd.I'm going to smash it with a hammer now.ENTOMBED RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Nocturne is a good band,"I just heard this cd last week when a friend let me borrow it. I really enjoyed it,and I was surprised that Nocturne is a Dallas band.I usually don't like female vocals but I found this chick to be amazing. The whole cd has an intriguing hard dark ambiance to it. I plan on buying all of the other Nocturne cds as well. Bottom Line---Listen to Nocturne---Their music speaks for itself and you won't be disappointed."
3,"Tries to be edgy, but comes across as kind of juvenile and fake","Not terrible, but not great, or even terribly good. Style and vocals remind me of a cross between Jane's Addiction and Marilyn Manson with a female singer, or maybe a female version of Dope with less intelligent lyrics that sound like they were written by a 16-year old goth kid in study hall, while the music sounds like someone made it at home on their PC. Entertaining at times if you're not feeling too picky and want some background noise while drinking or driving (preferably not both at the same time), but definitely not a favorite. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could, but since I can't I'll be generous and round up."
5,Bill Evans in high spirits at Montreux,"This is the only recorded live example of the short-lived trio Bill Evans had with Jack DeJohnette and judging from Bill's playing on this, it's a pity. Outside of drummer/friend Philly Jo Jones, Evans has rarely played with as much fire as he does here, not to discredit his regular bassist at the time, the excellent Eddie Gomez, but it's no surprise that this record won a Grammy for Best Jazz Performance. All the tracks shine but in particularly, Evans & company deliver such an impassioned performance of the Miles Davis modal tune, ""Nardis"", that one left me breathless. I could never understand why the succeeding drummer, the overly busy Marty Morell, stayed on so long with Bill. He lacked the precision and drive of DeJohnette, Philly Jo and Paul Motian and as such was a liability rather than an asset to the trio. Recommended for Evans fans definitely."
3,"Pretty good, but ends up quickly","I can't say that ""Airbag/How Am I Driving?"" is a bad EP. It features different sides on Radiohead's music (""Meeting In The Aisle"") and from the other hand, still using the formula that made ""OK Computer"" so successfull (""Palo Alto""), but it was damn too short! I think that Radiohead should take ALL the B-sides from the ""OK Computer"" singles and make a complimential substitute for the ""Airbag"" EP. Again, don't get me wrong, these songs are NOT bad songs, but I think that a longer EP (even an unofficial album) could do the job better."
4,radiohead b sides are beautiful,i just wish they'd release all the b sides from the bends in one package...bishop's robes...lewis etcetcetc...who can even get enough of rhead? not when they tease and tempt with every disc.
3,"Trippy, experimental side of the band....","Its tiresome for reviewers to put this collection down as a poor 'American follow up' To OK C. , for its not intended to be. Instead, enjoy it as a series of songs which didn't make the OK cut...I think this albums worth it for the hypnotic, disembodied 'Pearly', both versions of Polyethylene, and 'Palo Alto', which I think would've been right at home on the OK album. For true fans, it'll tide them over till the next release..for bandwagoners, it won't matter much."
5,really quite good,"I was just wanting something more, and this short CD provides a really good extension of OK computer: the seven songs are as symphonically complicated as the OK Computer sound, and yet there is one track, I think the last one, which really rocks out and should be listened to VERY LOUDLY...overall a great mini album."
4,Collector's...read this,For those who care...the version of Pearly* that appears here is slightly different than the Paranoid Android single version. Different background music and a true ending make it different
5,Airbag / How Am I Driving - Radiohead,"An obscure single or an underground EP. However you view the Radiohead single ""Airbag / How am I driving"" it is sublime. Thom Yorke's effortless vocals reach peaks that no other voice can and the relative obscurirty of the piece makes it al the more satisfying to own. Needless to say Radiohead mix heartbreaking lyrics with an effotless tone that only they can produce. Despite having no ""big singles"" on the EP it is more than enough to keep real fans entertained. This is a piece of music that every Radiohead fan should own."
4,Afterthought?,"When I read the enclosed review for this cd, I was mortified. To call this beautiful followup an ""afterthought"" doesn't begin to understand why this was released. The beautiful, and haunting ""a reminder"" is one of the most soothing tracks radiohead has ever written, and it's immediately followed by ""Polyethylene"", my personal favorite song, which has such a driving power that can't help but sing along, despite the unintelligible lyrics. This cd comprises, in eight tracks, the entire spectrum of Radiohead's musical vision, from utter serenity to total chaos, and all on tracks you can't hear anywhere else. Seems like a good deal for nine bucks."
4,Half-hearted effort yet DELICIOUS!,"Perfectly complementary to any Radiohead CD you own. Just wished it would have been full-length, and didn't include a song from their last album. For a half-hearted effort: four stars."
5,"The modern Pink Floyd, easy!","Most of these tracks where what was left off of OK Computer, and they all would be smash hits on any normal bands feature album. Polyethylene (part 1 and 2) could easily establish any band, yet its a ""left over"" from a allready great album by easily the most artistic and talented band since Pink Floyd. While that may be a lofty comparision, the boys from Oxford certainly live up to the legacy. Every track opn this mini-album is well worth any effort to obtain this CD. Most certainly a must for any person who has tracked the progress of one of the most talented bands around. Thom Yorke is the 90's Bono, with a lyrical and vocal talent rarely seen. Buy this CD, or at least listen to it, your life will be better!"
5,ARTISTIC ROCK BAND SCORES AGAIN!,I recommend this EP for two reasons. 1) it's cheap. 2) it's an excellent album if you've bought all of their CD's and you are looking for MORE! MORE! MORE!!! ....of their cool music.Buy it NOW!
5,some of the radiohead's best,"Some people like to call this OK Computer material, but I find it takes an at least slightly different vibe. ""Pearly"", ""Polyethaline..."" and ""A Reminder"" are some of my favorite Radiohead songs ever. I love the unprofessional and nostalgic feel of this CD.I wonder why Radiohead has so many great songs (including ""Bishop's Robes"", ""Lift"" and the songs I mentioned above) that are not on their main albums while their latest albumns, Kid A and Amnesiac, contain a lot of mediocre material (unlike OK Computer and The Bends).Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I don't particularly like ""Palo Alto"". ""Meeting in the..."" has a dark feel and is one of the only (would you count ""Treefingers""?) Radiohead instrumentals. ""Melatonin"" is good also.You should definately try to find a copy of this CD if you are a fan of OK Computer or newer Radiohead songs such as ""Pyramid Song""."
2,Save your money,"Let me just start by saying OK Computer is one of my favorite albums ever. That level of creativity has rarely been approached by anybody. That being said, there is a reason these songs were not included in that album: it's because they're just not really that great. The material on ""Airbag"" just does not stand up to the OK Computer material.Airbag, which incidentally happens to be the only track on OK Computer, happens to be the best song on this EP. Most of the others seem disorganized and disoriented... ""Pearly"" is a clear step down from the track that precedes it. ""Polyethylene"" is decent, but would still only make an average (at best) song on OK Computer.If you already have all of Radiohead's material, go ahead and get this. But get the rest of it (with the obvious exception of Pablo Honey) first."
4,cool stuff!! - 4 1/2 stars,"what a cool ep! radiohead's always been a band to put lots of work into their music, and this is no exception.""airbag"" - of course we all know this fabulous song, but this time, there's a surprise! instead of the familiar sounds of ""paranoid android"" coming after it, we venture into a whole new musical journey.........""pearly"" - yes!! what a great song. a hypnotic rock song. can't ask for more, right?""meeting in the aisle"" - a trancey techno hypnotizing song. very good!""a reminder"" - wow. this song is amazing.. thom wrote it as a kind of letter to his young self, from the perspective of an old unhappy man. lyrics and music are great.""polyethylene"" - one of the most beautiful openings in music i've ever heard, which breaks out into a jam thing, very much like ""the aeroplane flies high"" by smashing pumpkins.""melatonin"" - so beautiful.""palo alto"" - a pablo honey-sounding straight-up rock song. quite cool."
4,Excellent CD; Even Better Value,"4.5 Stars, actually. This CD is a must-buy for all Radiohead fans. It contains 6 b-sides that were initially featured on 3 different singles (UK imports of ""Paranoid Android"", ""Karma Police"" and ""No Surprises"") for a bargain basement price of 9 bucks. ""Polyethylene"" is probably my favorite Radiohead song from their ""Ok Computer"" era, and while the rest of the tracks may not live up to the level of their ""Bends"" era b-sides, they are still more than adequate."
3,OK's kissing cousin,"There are definitely some rocking tracks on this EP, title song notwithstanding. Moreover, it serves as an excellent companion to OK computer, probably the equivalent of a DVD extra. B-sides are always a treat from Radiohead and are kind of collector's specialties. More experimental than the normal album format allows for, but worth investigating and for finding that one favorite gem that you can't find anywhere else. Palo Alto seems to be that track on this EP."
4,Ignore the nonsense below...,"The two reviews written prior to mine are pure examples of ignorance. I'll keep this short and to the point, Celtic Frost is a superb band that is worth investigation. This is the band at their most raw and primal stage. Though there are slight instances of sameiness, there is enough raw energy and diversity here to produce one of the most memorable trash albums in history.I do not expect this review to be a major aid to one's investigation of Celtic Frost. All I can say is that as a multi-faceted music fan (From this to Love's ""Forever Changes"" to Ravi Shankar) this is worth a shot if you want to give legitimate metal a chance.Anybody who thinks that ""Future World"" can hold a candle to, let alone surpass, ""Procreation of the Wicked"" needs to stop watching Lord of the Rings habitually and acquaint themselves with some decent taste (and rent Elephant)."
3,Are You Morbid? Celtic Frost's Heaviest,This is one heavy album. This is Celtic Frost before a lot of the progressive experimentation. It starts off with the heavy song Into the Crypt of Rays and sports a pretty spooky intro. The song is cool. Procreation (Of The Wicked) is one of their best songs. The main guitar riff is a standout. Return to the Eve's got some good vocals courtesy of Tom G. Warrior. The strangest thing on this album is the instrumental Danse Macabre. Totally fearful and something that would be neat to play on Halloween. The last three songs are not memorable. Pretty good metal. Overall a worthy release.
2,Gutter Metal,"I am too much of progressive metal and good musicianship to like this album. You might see it on some of the lists of the best metal albums ever. However, Morbid Tales doesn't have much to offer. There is a certain type of fan though that would love this. For example, if you love Bleach by Nirvana, which was Nirvana's first effort, put out before they got big, then you might like Morbid Tales. Another band Morbid Tales by Celtic Frost reminds me of is Type O Negative. There is not much talent, but the music accomplishes something through just being so primitive and dark. And, keep in mind when I give an album a star, I give it a start because I live the album! I don't give starred reviews to albums that I don't like!"
5,the best of the mighty frost,"morbid tales is a bad ass straight forward early death metal album. starts off w an eery track called human, then goes into the fast paced into the crypts of rays. this is followed by the slow yet heavy and i mean heavy riff of dethroned emperor one of my favs. next up procreation of the wicked. another slower tempo song also with sludgy heavy as f**k riffs. the emperors return ep ends the album with circle of the tyrants a true frost classic. visual aggression and suicidal winds all fast movin death/speed metal monsters. great stuff. well worth your hard earned coin."
4,EVIL! (I guess),"Morbid Tales is one of the early classics of European thrash and death metal. While it hasn't been a major favorite of mine, this album exudes the kind of extreme heaviness and diabolic flavor that makes this genre so endearing. This collection runs the gamut from energetic speed metal ('Into the Crypt of Rays') to a crawling, palm-muted sludge ('Procreation of the Wicked') with pretty convincing results. Personally, I think the grunt-choke vocals are rather poor, but they hardly detract from the overall experience. The Morbid Tales material is nicely produced although the Emperor's Return material (the last three tracks) suffers from poor sound quality. Still a rewarding release."
3,Siempre CALAMARO ANDRES (obviamente),"Si te gusta escuchar música sin pensar y relajarte con eso, no escuches este disco, porque para escucharlo hay que estar dispuesto a encarnarse en la piel de Calamaro el que transmite fielmente (así parece) la experiencia de existir dentro de su cuerpo, con su mente y en contacto con el exterior siempre injustamente relativo."
3,HONESTIDAD DEMASIADA BRUTAL,"CREO QUE ESTE DISCO REFLEJA EL MOMENTO DIFICIL QUE ESTA PASANDO. DE LAS 37 CANCIONES DEL DISCO HAY POR LO MENOS 20 QUE ESTAN DEMAS ¿POR QUE NO HABRA HECHO UN BUEN DISCO DE 15 CANCIONES? HAY ALGUNAS QUE SUENAN DEMASIADO DYLAN (NO TAN BUENOS AIRES ES UNA FALTA DE RESPETO A BOB). PERO BUENO A CALAMARO HAY QUE SEGUIR BANCANDOLO. LO MEJOR:PALOMA, CON ABUELO, Y LOS AVIONES."
2,muy mal grabado,Las canciones del album 1 estupendas como siempre en Calamaro. Pero la grabacion es terrible. Muy mala calidad del disco.
5,Excelente CD,"Este doble album de Andres Calamaro es un producto bien elaborado desde el punto de vista tanto de la lirica,como el de las letras.Para mi la mejor composicion de este album es la titulada La Parte de Alante por el caracter erotico de sus letras y porque no cae en la vulgaridad a que nos tienen acostumbrados otros interpretes de este genero musical.En otros temas del album,Calamaro nos presenta una clase de vision progresista de cosas que se presentan en el quehacer cotidiano.Recomiendo sinceramente este disco a los amantes de la buena musica.Danilo Rodriguez,Providence,RI"
4,A classic for spaceflight fans.,"Although somewhat outdated nowadays (last printed in 1975), this is a great book for anyone wanting an introduction to the first 15 years of manned spaceflight. The illustraions most in full color are exceptional showing cut away drawings and photos of all major manned craft. The text is well wriiten brief without being too simplified. It also serves as a guide to how progress in manned spaceflight has been held back over the last 40 years by budget cuts and a lack of vision."
3,It works,"Decent filter. Easy to install, and easy to take out again, lol. Water tastes good too, but extremely low water pressure. Took about 15 minutes to fill up a 2 gallon jug."
4,Good Water,"Easy to change filter and water that tastes good are my criteria. To that I would add compact size. I use this in my RV, and the RV filter pack came with the level 4 filter which is much more rotund in size. It might do a more thorough job in filtering some things, but not that I can tell. This filer is half the price & lasts a full season. We use either city water or water in our tanks that has been filtered and re-chlorinated for storage. [1 Tablespoon per 10 gallons.] Works well & makes great tasting coffee & tea."
5,water taste great and saves us $$$$,This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Three times per year I change the cartridge and we always have great tasting water.
2,Works good but clogs quick,We've tried two of these filters and every time they clog in a matter of two or so weeks. The EZ-4's last for 4-5 months each but these clog in 10-14 days.That being said for the 2 weeks they work the water tastes good.
5,Searched high and low,"I searched every home store I could think of locally for the filters and no one even sells the vacuum anymore, let alone the filter. I even went online to most of the stores and it is not being carried! I know I'll need more filters, so I bought multiple to avoid the shipping cost."
5,Don't be without them,easy to use and works well. Have not had to use it yet but from past experoence I know it will work well
1,Does not fit Dirt Devil Stick Vac,"The way the filter was presented with the Stick Vac I assumed they went together....that is not true, so be aware before ordering."
3,"Not Dirt Devil brand, but works","While the product description lists this F9 filter as being ""by Dirt Devil,"" the one received after ordering from this page was an aftermarket Crucial Vacuum filter. So in this case it's ""by Crucial Vacuum"" not ""by Dirt Devil,"" though other reviewers have reported receiving genuine Dirt Devil (which is what I expected). And it was from an Amazon-fulfilled, Prime-eligible seller. Confusingly, the Crucial Vacuum filter box received had a sticker with the Dirt Devil part number.The filter fits well and seems to work fine, so that's in Crucial Vacuum's favor. But if you're going to actually buy Crucial Vacuum aftermarket parts, you might as well purchase the product from the page offering the Crucial Vacuum filter, as it costs less there. It wasn't worth returning for the small difference in price."
4,Cosmic Discoveries: The Wonders of Astronomy,"If you love history, and love astronomy, Cosmic Discoveries is the book for you!"
4,Stimulates the imagination,"I wanted my kid to imagine the big world and all its diversity. I love DK in general as the leader in visual presentation. This covers a wide range of geography and culture in pictures and blurbs, fun as a basis for good conversation."
3,Good first book flawed by weak editing.................,"...I was surprised something as glaring as the location that an Iranian airliner was shot down by USS Vincennes could be done wrong once,let alone twice. But it was. The incident happened over the Persian Gulf, not the Atlantic Ocean. There are many other uh-oh's in editing.May not matter to some but it does to me."
3,3 1/2 stars,"As mentioned by other reviewers, this thriller follows a typical formula. Ex-CIA persona chases terrorist.Not a lot of originality hear. The writing was okay for a first novel. The story moved at a fast pace and supplied plenty of suspense but this novel provided no closure, and in the end, very little satisfaction.Here's hoping his sequel provides a little more satisfaction, although it would be hard not to."
5,A superb thriller,Thank you to Andrew Britton for this his first novel. Real excitement did bounce of every page. it is a superb thriller.Kealey and March circle each other in thier lethal game. and you find your self plunged into a nightmare world of terror and how the mind of Jason March ticks. Kealey's mission is to hunt down March and destroy him. March is losing it with Kealey and back tracks into his persoanl life. EDGE OF YOUR SEAT READING!!The only good thing about having to finish reading The American. is the fact that we know that this is a trilogy.I cannot wait for the next installment
2,Good Start Bad Ending,"I like the premise of this book. I listened to the CD Audio version that I picked up at a truck stop for $3. The set up was good. Good revenge factor. The big terror event was deflating and the ending was just not plausible. Trying to set up a sequel. An evil Jason Bourne series. I mean how can someone, even a super terrorist high IQ super villain type survive a 180 foot drop off a cliff into freezing sea water. I know about suspending belief but come on.While I am at it, I wish these authors would get rid of the female character who throws a fit when she realizes the protagonist is going to do his job. Throw a fit and go home so the villain can get them there. Talk about trite. Most people I know, male and female, would just tell these people to take a hike."
3,When does this get interesting?,"So far, i'm really not understanding these positive reviews i've seen here. I'll admit, ive only read a bit over 100 pages, but despite the semi interesting first few pages, not much has happened since. When is the author gonna get off the hero and his young gorgeous lover kick and decide this is an espionage thriller, and not a Danielle Steel sap novel?Britton should take notes from better authors such as Daniel Silva or Vince Flynn, and take a chill on all this dull romance, which most readers dont require in their thrillers."
2,Seen It Before,"Britton's character, Ryan Kealey, starts as wounded, troubled and believable character like the early Jason Bourne. However, he soon becomes a little too super like Mitch Rapp and Scott Harvath. The first part of the book was really strong and interesting but then became a stretch, formulaic, and repetitive. The bad guy is somewhat engaging but he could not carry the book."
4,Exciting,Even though some of the twists and turns were predictable the book was interesting. The villain was depicted as a psychopath with a reason to hate the people of the US. To bad the hero had to lose his fiance'
1,Geography suffers,"I listened to this on CD and after the first disk, couldn't wait to see how many errors he could weave into a simplistic story. In this day of computer access to maps, Mr Britton asks the listener/reader to suspend space and distance. He has his main character drove from Cape Elizabeth Maine to Bangor to fly out on United Airlines.First of all, United does not serve Bangor and why did he drive right by Portland, very near to Cape Elizabeth, to go another 100 or so miles to Bangor.?? Later his hero jumps into the ocean from another remarkable height.Could not finish it as the facts kept going off the rails distracting from what little plot he had going for him."
4,Good,Pretty good novel. read it for the first time and it was quite fast paced. Would surely recommend and read novels from Andrew Britton again.
2,Clunk!,"I pride myself in usually reading all of a book I start. This one tried my patience. For a suspense/ action novel, it was very long on plot-by-conversation, plot-by-meeting, unnecessary details, too many no-don't-go-in-there moments, too much telegraphing the plot, and too many long sections I speed-read my way through to get to some action. Too bad. The premise was good, and I was hoping for a good, action-packed read. Unfortunately, it never arrived. Not as good as his others.Bill Brown"
5,Kept me hostage for days,"Yes I am guilty of the old words ""Could not put it down""I willingly became a good book hostage. everytime I came to the end of a page I promised myself, this is it for today. But had to turn over and go on with my reading . It is very exciting.And Yes It does read like a movie script.And without a doubt it would make a very exciting movie.I am so looking forward now to the sequel of The American. So if Andrew Britton ever reads his reviews I hope he will let us know when we can expect to see that in book stores. ?"
3,slow paced story Audio 12 cds,I listen to approximately 4 to 5 audios a week.This story was interesting but quite slow paced. Many characters with lots of twists and turns.If you are looking for an action packed story this is not for you.A good story but not brilliant. The next audio I started wasTHE FIRST PATIENT By Michael Palmer. By the end of the 1st cd the story was gripping and I don't want to stop listening until the whole story is finished.
3,not that bad.,"i bought this because it was on the dexter's cigar label, a reissue label ran by jim o'rourke and david grubbs of gastr del sol, today. i don't know much about circle x, but from the cd i am guessing they were from louiseville or something. it said they moved to new york to record this album.anyhow, it's pretty good. kind of reminds me of a cross between shellac and some early punk bands. i can see how this would have some influence on a lot of the post rock/punk chicago scene (it was recorded in 1979.)the only real complaint is that it's about 11 minutes long, which isn't enough to justify paying 10 dollars."
3,"a good, dated study","Not only is this book 25 years, old but it covers men who retired between the years 1965 and 1980. That was my late grandfather's generation. Some findings about retirement are probably still true.I thought this book would be an anthology of men discussing the advantages and disadvantages of retiring. Instead, it was a dry study based on the census. It differentiates between results for black men versus white ones and married men versus the unmarried. I appreciated that it did not treat men as a monolithic group.Still, it's findings were often obvious. The men who didn't have health problems worked longer, so too did white-collar workers. Men in their 80s were more likely to be fully retired than men in their 60s. Not surprising at all.This book may have outlived its usefulness. Still, as the American population ages, some of the stuff here is still relevant. Maybe gerontologists and Social Security Administration staffers would really like this text."
1,Very Frustrating,"While reading this book I was very excited because it made a lot of sense until I got to the actual practical application of what to do. I am a complete novice at Maya and this book was so frustrating. It would say click on ""X"" but it didn't say where ""X'"" was or even where to look for it! I spent lots of time searching around the interface in vain and then resorting to looking directions up on the internet instead. I found that ""Learning Autodesk Maya 2008"" was a much better fit for me as a complete beginner. (that one gives more direction, but does leave you to figure out a few things on your own which I really liked)It may get better after the first chapter or so, but I didn't make it that far. I found my time better spent with the other book."
4,good for all,"Thi book, is really good for all,with simple exercises it teach about a character, from modeling to animation."
2,Step file with plastic bottom/foot covers that keep coming off,"It is a functional item of no particular standout quality. The rubber/plastic covers on the ends keep coming off, which is a nuisance."
4,"Decent file sorter, could use some improvement","First, if you use it like the picture, it's probably not too bad. It is clearly intended for manilla folders. If you try to use it with loose papers, their weight will cause them to fall through the rack, leaving you with a mess.Each folder can be about 1/2 inch thick before the wires start pinching the folder or squeezing the neighboring slots. If you need more than this, you probably should get a regualr hanging file drawer.As others have noted, the unit is too wide at the base. If you aren't careful, or if you nudge the unit, odds are that your folders will fall off one end or the other and you have to set the whole thing up again. A solution is to get some string and pull the feet together about 2 to 3 inches. That gives it a much more secure feel in holding your files."
4,Nice Big Sorter,"This was the only sorter that I found that was reasonably priced that had 8 slots. I really like that the divider wires go up almost to the top of the folders, that way when I need to slip a single piece of paper behind the wire and in front of the folder, the paper doesn't curl over. The slots are a good width, each slot holds 3 of my folders that are pretty stuffed. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because of the two back legs. When I push the sorter all the way to my cubby wall, the back legs slip off the back edge of my desk. The cubby wall does stop it from falling so it's really not a big deal. If the legs were situated an inch or so from the back or even angled forward. That would solve the problem. Overall, I really like this sorter."
1,A Complete Waste of Money.,"Don't waste our money on this software. On my Palm Tungsten T, the maps are fuzzy images. The information is not really very useful either. It also is not user friendly. This is the worst SW purchase that I have made for my Palm & I have been using one for years.In a nutshell, this product stinks and I cannot find one good feature that is worth mentioning."
1,Amazon should make a 1/2 star for the really really bad.,"Not only is it not very easy to use, it doesn't give you a visual format for point to point destination, only text directions. Then the SD went bad for a reason beyond my understanding one day when I tried to use it, and now everytime I try to calculate a point to point destination my tungsten gets a fatal error and requires a hard reset. Only with this SD program do I have this problem with my PDA. This sucks so bad that Amazon should incorporate the 1/2 star for beyond bad."
2,Helpful - but potentially outdated,"I bought this card hoping it would give me Mapquest on my Palm. It doesn't. But it does have the exits for US Interstates and can generate directions between major cities in the US. Also, the information is dated, some resturants have closed (most Gas stations appear to be correct), and I'm sure some new resturants have opened, so your milage may vary. :-)The detail level of the maps is not great, but it supposedly matches the maps in the standard paper road map. I've not checked that out, but if it did, that would be nice. I would much rather have the detail of the paper map in my palm.Maybe the Palm doesn't support that level of detail (possible I suppose) - but then again maybe they don't want to give that much away. Overall, I'd say it's nice, but it's not the paper map (or online Map) replacement I was hoping it would be."
3,"Not great, but still useful","The atlas isn't great for navigation, as it can't do point-to-point directions. It can get you from one city to another, however, and is also useful for calculating the distance between two cities. What makes this product worth owning is that with a simple touch on the screen, you can see what awaits you at the next exit - gas stations, restaurants, hotels, notable sites, etc...My atlas did not work on my Treo 600, however; it caused it to reset everytime I tried to access it. It's got to be a glitch with that particular model, however, as it worked fine on my Tungsten C."
2,Not Her Best Work,"I got this book because I LOVED ""Talk to the Hand"". That book was so on point that I was stunned. It was substantially better than ""Eats Shoots and Leaves"". This is an earlier work than either of the above, and Ms. Truss had not yet reached her stride in her writing. But I related alot to her reasoning about many things. So, if you want a book like ""Talk..."", this is not your book. But if you are just interested in a retro view of Ms. Truss's style, this IS your book."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I smiled occasionally, but was rather disappointed. I found the title misleading as it didn't seem to have much to do with cats."
2,Just Another Budget Book,"Another budget book that won't help you at all if you have big debt problems (The author admits this himself.)The Bill Buster ""System"" in this book works only if you already have sufficient income to cover your bills."
1,The Police Certifiable Live Buenos Aires (Blu-Ray) + 2 CD Set,"I Will List The Good and The BadThe Good: Excellent Picture Quality and a Great Setlist From The Police Catalogue!The CD Sounds Better Than DVD Which Should Never Be On Any 5.1 Surround System! (I Own a OPPO BDP-83 Blu-Ray Player)The Bad: What Poor Sound Quality On This Blu-Ray DVD On Either Settings In 5.1 or 2.1Personally The Sound Quality Is More Important To Me, Than The Video Quality!Suggestion: Buy Only Live CD Of This Concert!"
1,loudness war strikes again,"Great shows, some say the best of the tour.But the audio was mastered by a VIP (very incompetent person) and sounds ""too loud"", compressed and lacks detail and dynamics.Volume stays the same all along the concert...sad"
1,Loudness Wars strike again....too bad.....,"This refers to the Audio CD of certifiable.Certifiable, Death Magnetic, Accelerate, Vapor Trails, Icky Thump.........the loudness wars are ruining music and makes buying CDs too much of a gamble.No, I don't mean how loud the music was at the concert, if i want great music cranked loud know what i do ? i use the VOLUME knob !!!!No, the loudness wars refer to the mastering levels.Another victim, R.I.P recorded music.....http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_wars"
5,The BEST Police Concert!,Absolutely stunning. The videography and the performance of this concert were perfect. Sting and the guys have never sounded better! Sting doesn't seem to age at all!
3,Horribly compressed audio,"The audio mix on this Blu-ray disc is overly dynamic range compressed so it doesn't have any dimension to it and is quite harsh/brittle sounding at times. With its squashed dynamic range, it was pointless to present this in 96khz/24bit audio - if they used 8 bit audio it would sound exactly the same. But it's no wonder, the audio was mixed and mastered by Robert Orton, who calls himself the ""hit mixer"". It's apparent that Robert's mixing ""The Police"" like he does ""Lady Gaga"" and ""Enrique Iglesias"" does not yield optimal audio fidelity."
1,Terrible packaging,"Bought this from Best Buy and open it up and discover the cheapest packaging I've ever encountered. Cheap @$$ plastic trays that are only partially glued to the fold-out paper 'digipak' that screams ""what an idiot I am to buy this for over 30 dollars."" CDs were loose of course and scratched a bit even before opening it up. Avoid this at all cost!"
4,Almost bought the Vinyl release. More expensive though,"and I would have just transfered it to cd anyway. I already like the fact that it is in a widescreen release. The 4 stars is for the packaging however 5 stars for the single sided discs. I also do not like double sided discs. I will be back in a couple days to review disk material after I see and hear it.Ok 11/24/2008 and I finally pulled the first DVD from the case. As with the next reviewer finding the 109 minute concert to be on the first dvd - excellent, and the concert itself? Excellent. The second dvd was actually good, I say that as I am a music guy myself, still I found the main bonus feature to be watchable. This from a SAS person. The photo galleries were great with well chosen background music. If you like the Police, if you like concerts but not the crowds, this DVD is for you. Well, onto the cds. I don't expect any negative findings but will report back."
3,What a disjointed band!,"Sting's voice is annoying, it's downright bloody shreking! Copeland's drumming is all over the place (is he really a member of this band) and Somers is just trying to hold the band togather. God bless him...I can't understand the fascination with this group?"
4,Good product let down by poor listings,there are no track listings on the DVD's which was disappointing.The relationship between the band members is an interesting insight explored in the 2nd DVD - the CD's supplied give a recording of the DVD show - is this necessary? I would have preferred the original studio recordings. A good addition to my collection and one which I will visit again and again to try and inspire my next generation of music afficionados (i.e. teenage kids) with the greatest era of music - 70's and 80's - a bit like trying to poke butter up a hedgehog's bum with a hot needle. Not that I've ever tried...
3,It's just OK,"I caught a little bit of this on TV and wanted to see the rest, so I borrowed a copy of the DVDs. I just have to say that while it's a visually good show, the music/performance/mix leaves a bit to be desired. There seems to be very little live vocals, even the lead voice, with the exception of spoken word, appears to be lip synced. All of the backing vocals seem to be prerecorded as well as extra percussion & guitar parts. The audio is so hot, it pumps and crackles (stupid loudness war). Many of the songs lack the energy & strength they once had. I'll say, ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" took on a whole new direction that improves it in my opinion. I'll also admit that I didn't particularly care for the original version though."
2,Save your money.,"Loved volumes 1, 2 and 3 and could hardly wait for volume 4 to arrive on the shelves. Program one is Roy D. at his best. Program two is comprised of filler between Phil and Roy D. Surely, Roy, you have five or six more funny phone calls in your archives. Why fill up side two with disappointment just to sell CDs."
3,"It helps, but this book is not comprehensive.","Being new to carpentry, I purchased this book to get aquainted with finish work. Previous reviewers spoke of this book being outdated and I agree. However, as an apprentice, I found useful methods including tips for scribing and fitting interior finishes. Putting these methods in the back of my mind has facilitated my work.The organization of material is haphazard at best. This is not a textbook, but a collection of articles from Fine Homebuilding magazine. If you are looking to familiarize yourself with some basic techniques and universal situations in finish carpentry, this book will be a decent start. For the experienced carpenter, look elsewhere."
5,You just can't top them!,"Their energy permeates every song, especially the covers! Once you hear them you can never go back. I love Stevie, but higher ground is just that."

3,It's okay,"Plenty of pictures of crashed cars but the reproduction of the pictures leaves something to be desired. The captions provide interesting information in a corny style, but I often wondered how he knows these things. Some information could only be had by reading the police reports of the accidents or seeing the actual cars up close."
4,Quite a good read.,I bought this book when I began my paraglider training. One year later and I am still getting it out every now and again to reference it.Its a good reference for the beginner and novice paraglider pilot.
3,Kenny Rogers - Across My Heart CD,"Some good selections - ""Across My Heart"" is by far the best of all the music offered on this CD."
3,Not Kenny's Best,I LOVE Kenny Rogers. This is not one of his best albums. I do however really love the song Write Your Name. This was my first dance with my husband at our wedding. Some of the songs seem like they are a little over done. He's still my hero.
3,good listening,Have always been a Brian Setzer fan since I first heard him during his Stray Cats years.His Christmas selection is good and it was enjoyed through the holidays here.
4,"Christmas, Setzer style","Pleasant and fun Christmas CD. A good holiday listen for fans of big band/swing/boogie woogie, etc. Good companion piece to the superior WE THREE KINGS by Reverend Horton Heat. YEA!"
4,Christmas Cool!,"Released again this year for Christmas, the great front man for the rockabilly/neo-swing revolution does it up right with a set of Holiday classic retro-rocked tracks, that fill the Christmas season with an injection of high octane fun and mayhem. The Brian Setzer Orchestra is back-and Boogie Woogie Christmas (Surfdog) is exactly what your stocking ordered!If you want high energy in your Kringle, you're going to thrill for Brian's new interpretation of ""Jingle Bells,"" and really get excited for the surf guitar vibe of ""Sleigh Ride."" There's some fun surprises, like the duet with Ann Margret on ""Baby It's Cold Outside,"" and a special tribute to Les Brown by way of ""The Nutcracker Suite."" Even the slower, more thoughtful pieces like ""O Holy Night"" are electric in their contemporary energy.Accompanying booklet contains complete song lyrics and band credits. This is the hot rod of Christmas CDs-a real must for the holiday season!"
3,Setzer's singing doesn't match the band,"This is undeniably a fun Christmas CD. It is fast, loud, and energetic. I have been a Setzer fan since his Stray Cats days and enjoyed The Dirty Boogie. The problem with this CD is his singing. His voice has not fared well with age. He has almost no range. His voice is not much more than a monotone shout/growl. Even in a jump band setting Christmas songs require some range. His band deserves a sassy, dynamic singer (or two). This record would be 5 stars with a better singer."
4,Christmas music,"Brian Setzer is always fun to listen to, and this helps get you in the Christmas spirit.It was a great gift for a friend."
4,Boogie Woogie Christmas rocks!!,"I really enjoy this CD. Setzer gives us a number of Christmas faves in the style that made BSO famous, which is exactly what I wanted- cool Christmas tunes that are VERY swingable. But I think that by far the best track on the CD is the rendering of ""O Holy Night""- a slow, soulful song, its not dancing material but still shines brighter than every other song."
5,Best of the Best,"It's not really christmas until you pop this album in your cd player and rock!It's funny that Brian got the idea after playing the ""Mark and Brian"" Christmas Show in Los Angeles acouple of years ago (and his manager who also manages Gary Hoey).I can't wait for the new Christmas album comming out this year ""Dig That Crazy Christmas"".Almost as good is BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY ""Everything You Want For Christmas"" and just for kicks any of Gary Hoey's Christmas albums (com'on Christmas songs on electric Guitars)"
4,NickleBack-If Everyone Cared,The items I recieved were in good shape and were shipped to me in a timely fashion. I will trust this site to do business with again if needed in the future.
4,"Not single song, but three great songs!","This is great single, just wished it had been all the same song, but the other two songs they chose to go with it were great too. My fault. For the money and length of time the song plays I would get the mixed album with more songs, I JUST EXPECT WHEN YOU BUY SINGLE SONG THAT YOU GET SINLGE SONG OR DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THAT SONG."
1,BAD,"We ordered this item based on the picture and it was not what was sent to us. This is a waste of time and money. Then, they charged us to return the item."
5,Must have,Good quality bag and everything is neatly packed and ready to go. I've impressed my family and friends with this one so much so that I know for a fact 2 other people ordered their own.
3,emergency backpack,"The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is this: When I opened the pack, the zipper broke right away. Secondly, I noticed that the pack was advertised to have a larger and more inclusive first aid kit. I contacted the company and notified them that the first aid kit they gave me was much smaller than advertised and missing 12 pieces. They simply said that I could make up the difference by adding 12 bandaids, myself. Another reason was that all of the batteries that were included, were outdated and some of the products were filthy. They looked like they had been stored in a very dirty warehouse for a very long time. In all, I am glad I have this kit and I think it will be good to have in an emergency; just a little frustrated with the customer service and condition of supplies"
5,Well stocked and will be useful,"Truthfully I ordered this to serve as an emergancy kit fot the car. After receiving it, I naturally poked around inside and I must say I was please. It was exactly as described, well stocked and ready to roll. After adding a couple minor things like a good knife. It is sett and ready to go for just about any reason. I'm looking to get a second kit when they've restocked."
2,"It's alright, very basic.","This kit contains a lot of cheaply made items that won't be worth anything should a survival situation arise. Yes the cheap flashlight, ""first aid kit"" (which is a few finger bandaids) and tent/ponchos, utility knife, should be of use for a very short time. I do like the water and high calorie food bars, but the rest of the items I should've bought elsewhere that will last me longer than the chinese crap sent with this kit."
4,"Great for the ""starting prepper""","This pack is great to get you started. We are using it as a ""base"" and plan on adding other items. While some things are ""cheap"" overall we are very happy with this. We do plan on getting a bigger backpack to add items and plan on covering the lettering and crating a second pack out of the original bag. (dont want to be a walking target with bright yellow survival bag letters on our back). a great start for the begining prepper!!"
4,Writing for love,"Moravia writes with simplicity and charm, a short and simple story about Silvio, an aspiring writer and his beautiful young wife. When they moved to the countryside in the hope of realising Silvio's writing ambitions, they soon discover that Silvio was unable to satisfy his ambition nor his wife. One might think that that is all there is - a story of failure; but on reflection, it is a thought provoking tale that makes us think about the chasm between dream and reality, and the happiness one seeks and the unpredictable ways we lose our way in process of searching. In the end, one does not condemn, and the epiphany that fell on Silvio also renders us incapable of being judgmental. It partially explains the nature of many relationships, and Moravia summed it up in one curt sentence: ""Women love failed men who have renounced all ambition except to make them happy."" The rest we have to discover for ourselves."
4,A quick concise view of an artists' heart,"This tale was a quick and incisive view into one artist's struggle with his ambition, and with love. Despite having every material thing he might wish for, the wealthy protagonist can't seem to produce his ultimate dream: a literary work of art. His attempt at resolving the dilemma provides a deceptive resolution, and ultimately threatens his entire concept of himself.Moravia's storytelling style is incisive, simple and quite addictive. I literally couldn't put the book down once I started. The plot is simple yet intriguing, and one feels immediately invested with the character's struggle. Some surprising and wise observations about human nature, and our inability to rise above our shortcomings. Interesting that the setting is 1937, because the concerns feel so contemporary. And yet, the end does provide hope. Looking forward to re-reading this, and reading all of Moravia's other works.Highly recommended read."
3,EOIC1 REVIEW,"This book, although it contains alot of information, doesn't have much detail. It is structured like an encyclopedia, with alphabetic categories, consequently it's not a book for reading but for reference. There is no fluidity to the read and is merely a port of call for some basic information."
4,Great Classic,Grat old time time classic. Father's Table Grace especially good. Seems shorter than most CDs' today. If you like classic Flatt & Scruggs you won't be disappointed.
4,Que chevere!,"This is a cool cd. I heard it in Colombia this spring. If you like ""House Merengue"" you will like this cd. It puts typical Colombian songs, like la piragua & pollera colora, in this exiting rythm."
1,Loma Lux,"Loma Lux Homeopathic Medicine, Acne Pill, 100 tabletsI ordered this product for my son. He took this as directed for three weeks. He did see no results. From my experience, i would not recommend this product"
3,Would recommend product,"Loma Lux Homeopathic Medicine, Acne Pill, 100 Tablets REALLY DID HELP WITH MY NIECE AND MY ACNE. WOULD PURCHASED AGAIN"
2,Mentality,"Although it would be nice to have a pill that directly attacks the source of acne (from the inside out), unfortunately 'AcnePill' is far from that. I was desparate (after trying creams [such as Benzoyl Peroxide]) that I decided this pill would hopefully cure me. Well after using this product (and following the simple directions), I believe I saw a reducting in my acne ONLY BECAUSE I wanted to see a reduction, not because of the pill's effects. To put it boldly, this is no more than a placebo. Sure it can decrease acne (barely), but that's only because you stress less about it knowing you popped a pill and moved on with your day. Just look at the ingredients--recognize them? If you're looking for a pill that will make you feel better, go ahead and buy these. Otherwise, I'd suggest keeping your money."
1,Don't do it!,This is a homeopathic remedy. It's just water. It is worthless. Do your research before you buy things![...]
4,It worked for me,"I never write reviews but this product just worked really well for me and I am bored so I decided toI have suffered from bad skin/acne since I was in high school and I am 26 now.I have used Proactiv, Bioelements, Malin and Goetz, and Murad acne treatments and while they were all effective...my skin eventually got used to each and they stopped working as well as they each did initially.I have been using Acne Pill for 3 months now...I saw changes within the first month.I still get acne but only a zit or two compared to the many before, I would estimate at least 60-75 percent decrease in acne after using this product.Obviously what works for one doesn't work for all so I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't work for someone else...but for people that haven't tried it and have suffered from acne, I don't see what trying it would hurt."
1,didnt work for me,"I went through 2 bottles. For the 1st one i was taking 2 pills in the morning and chewing them which taste really bad in my opinion.For the 2nd bottle i upped the dose to 3 pills in the morning because i did not see any results. Meaning i still would get small break outs. So i wanted something that works internally to hopefully completely clear my skin and this just did not do what the bottle says its supposed to for me. Now everyone is different and it really depends on eating habits, sleep, exercise, etc. Hope it works for you.update 5/1/11I have since stopped using this product, now im just using the acne.org regimen with very good results an 90% clear skin."
2,Not really worth it.,"Finally finished using this product. Took 1 month to finish the bottle. I took 2 pills the 1st week and then bumped it up to 3 a day thereafter. I'm starting to see some results. I've had acne all over my back since forever and finally starting to see them getting smaller. I still get those occasional pimples once in awhile however. My take another couple months to see my skin clear up though. One thing I hate is the price since it doesn't last for very long. But I guess if its helping its worth it.Update.Ok, finished off 3 bottles of this stuff. Still was taking 3 a day everyday. I did not notice any helpful benefits by taking this. Still was getting terrible acne on my back. It may have helped somewhat by limiting the number but still not enough to warrent a fourth bottle. I did however combine this with Oxy cleansing pads towards the finishing off the bottle. That seems to be working better than taking pills."
4,Seems to have helped.,"Seems to have helped reduce the use of immediate relief scrips and preventative steroid inhalers. Have used for almost 30 days. So far, so good!"
1,Didn't work at all for me,"I was hopeful that it might at least help reduce my acne but I used it faithfully for a month, took the correct dosage, and it didn't work at all. Others said it took 3 to 4 weeks, maybe I should have given it more time, but I figured after a month, with my breakouts as bad as ever, I didn't want to waste another 25 bucks or so to find out."
1,not helping...,me dont not really recommend this... not that effective.. get accutane... help a lots.. .. . .. .. .. ..
1,Didn't Help My Acne,"I received my pills very quickly which was about the only good thing I can say about them. I took them religiously for about 3 weeks and saw no change in my acne. I then upped my dosage by one pill and still no significant changes. I guess I will be looking for another ""magic"" acne pill. Good luck."
3,Still Missing,"Speaking as someone who already owns three of these titles on DVD, this box set makes no sense at all. ""A Hard Day's Night"" would be the only reason to buy it, and it's missing. Surely it will be available again, as will ""Let It Be"" I hope, so I will wait till they assemble ALL the Beatles movies before buying a set of them."
3,Original ???,"Actually, I buy this DVD version because i expect it have an excellent quality.However.....! The soundtrack is not match with the action of the Music video(except first US Visit). It clearly have some time delay. It is different from VHS version which i also have.The picture and the soundtrack is separted, it lose the original feel. If i only expected the remaster version of the song , i think i can just listen CD."
4,Pretty Good,"It's actually a pretty good documentary, and Phil Collins does a good job. Not a lot of it is really new, but it is pretty good, and the clip of You Can't Do That is pretty spectacular. I'd suggest this to a Beatles fan."
5,An engaging and beautifully-produced documentary,"This is one of those rare documentaries that is worthy of the film it is documenting. The editing is absolutely brilliant, and the interviews with the filmmakers are engaging. Using the Beatle video and sound bytes from the film to comment on the commentators is hysterical and right within the spirit of ""A Hard Day's Night""- one of the best film musicals ever made. If this review were within the film documentary, you would now be hearing a sound byte from John Lennon saying ""I could listen to him for hours."""
2,C. Molanphy's comment above still right on target after 11 years!,"Christopher Molanphy's review of The Beatles DVD Collector's Set is still completely accurate in 2012, especially his comments about The Compleat Beatles, and how it is STILL (even now!) far and away the tightest and best produced Beatles documentary to date. Why has this 30 year-old gem never been digitized by MGM or CBS or whoever owns the publishing rights? No DVD of this masterpiece? No available script or subtitles (in English) of the original VHS so that those of who'd like to make our own DVD from the VHS could? It's a crying shame. Come on, O Beatle Publisher Gods, you can do it!"
5,An excellent album with the best of the best artist,This album is a compilation of some of the best songs of this excellent artist. Yolandita is for me without any doubt the best singer of Latin America. I really recommend people to buy this album.
5,Worth it if you like the Bizarre,"The FBI, the Italian Mafia, and various neighborhood gangs, all fighting each other for a chance to ""off"" a no-named gang of-of-of--children? Like Carlton Mellick's books, this book recognizes the absurd and takes you to its center where you swim in it, revel in it, laugh-lap it up, until the last sentence has been read and reread. As a first time author, Brian shows great skill in demanding your attention, and you have no choice but to submit to the characters thoughts, actions, and speech. A must read for anyone who enjoys bizarro-fiction."
4,absurdly humorous fiction,"I was turned on to this book by a co-worker who knew that I was a fan of Chuck Palahniuk, Dennis Johnson, and Carlton Mellick the 3rd. He told me that this author, Brian J. Kamerer, wrote in a similar vein of strange fiction, but with a voice all his own. I borrowed a copy of this book from him, and liked it so much I still had to order my own from a local bookstore. It's fast-paced, strange, and unpredictable, but it is never wierd solely for the sake of being wierd. The often absurd plot is held together by very interesting and human characters who keep Dreamy Filthy Suicide from crossing the line between bizarre and just plain stupid. I recommend this for anyone who likes good, creative fiction that has definite re-read value."
5,"Ironic, ain't it?","The very language that makes this book ever interesting and twists the twisted into beautiful icing rich deliciousness would make some English Lit. Teachers cringe. I love this book -- its modern analysis of our modern media drenched world . . . I ache for Darren, ugly on the outside, but so chewy and sweet on the inside . . . I can recognize aspects of myself in him. I love the business with the chat rooms -- some thoughts about them that I'd never thought before. Brian has an uncanny, better than nearly anyone ability to see some Truth, point out contradictions, and relish in the irony of life through the worlds he creates. I hope a collection of his short pieces is coming soon. Brian is able to leave out a lot of descriptions, which actually adds to the world of the story. This book is not at all bogged down or over burdened with redundant, superfluous overly descriptive garbage, like Dickens or Faulkner. Very entertaining, thought-provoking book, Brian!"
1,Can't afford the shipping,"The tea tastes great, Apricot is my favorite. But the cost of shipping is outrageous!! I didn't realize that a box of tea would cost almost $20 once I pay for shipping. Next time I'll purchase locally"
1,Poor Compatibility! The Worst Warranty I ever Met!!,"Poor Compatibility! Not a single disc burnt! The Worst Warranty I ever Met!! As simple as that.I bought it from Staples two months ago, and I hsve been struggling with it ever since. I contacted I/O Magic technical support and customer service several times, of course, I have been asked to update all drivers from Desktop chipset to ATPI driver, DVDRW drive's firmware. This product at last simply even stopped reading days ago. Then I met with the worst warranty I ever have before. The WARRANTY simply asks you to pay for the return and replacement delivery no matter it is a defective one or not!!!!!!!Watch out and follow experts' advice on some reliable brands, unless you want to struggle with this product with poor quality and pay for the freight youself!This is definitely my last experience with I/OMagic."
2,Writing with errors after 3 months,"It was great for the first 3 months. I use Nero Ultra 6 (not OEM from this product) and is up to date. After 3 months of use, it wrote with errors and cannot use those discs. Nero can varify whatever writing with it. Now, it's just a DVD-ROM, not DVD-RW double layer!"
1,Not even fit for firewood,"This is hands down the worst novel I have ever read, ever...EVER. It was incongruent from beginning to end. I don't even know why I kept reading it. Quite possibly the most malignant and offensive work of fiction I've ever experienced that sells out any sense of integrity established by his last novel Novus Ordo Seclorum. I'd rather read a laundry list of things I have to do before my mother-in-law visits for Christmas than read this work of sludge. The loose connections and abrupt transitions were the selling points of the novel besides the somewhat ironic political incorrectness which was refreshing. Whoever wrote the editor review didn't read the same book. Writing this review is probably a waste unless it saves one person the $$$$$ or time reading it. DOn't buy this book it is aweful."
3,"Good Saw, but",Pros -1. This saw makes very clean and accurate cuts2. It is clean to use. Only metal chips are created and they are easy to clean up3. Portable - It is portable and requires very little spaceCons -1. The blades are expensive2. You must keep the blade cool when cutting. This requires VERY slow cuts on thick material or cutting oil or a cooling system. After going through two blades quickly (even when cutting slowly) I purchased a cooling spray system for the saw. This drove the cost up to the point where I could have purchased a good band saw unit.
3,Great Saw but be prepared to buy a new blade,"Like others commenting here, the blade life for me was very disappointing, I might have made 50 cuts on a variety of low carbon steel (angle, tubing, thin wall pipe, round bar stock and flat). The saw has plenty of power, cuts square and virtually burr free. But be prepared to shell out another $100 for a better blade. Don't bother wasting your time sharpening the Milwaukee Blade, I did with the same disappointing results. The saw gets a 5 Star Rating the Blade a 1."
2,Don't do it.,"I bought this saw for our metal shop thinking I would save some money on a cold saw. No dice. we have 3 ($100 each) blades that we keep in rotation sending them to be sharpened to keep my with our semi moderate production. Beyond that I now have had the base crack and the clamp has failed. We have highly experience metal workers using this saw, it is just not up to par. For lightweight extremely occasional use it would be great, or for mobility to a job site. We are using it on lightweight steel and it just wont take the 7 hours of constant use once a week."
1,Milwaukee metal cutting saw,"The saw arrived by UPS. The factory box was damaged and showed signs of water damage. The saw was packaged upside down in the box. The saw housing fasteners backed off after a days worth of cutting. This could have resulted in a catastrophic failure if not discovered. The Milwaukee blade lasted half a day. I swithched over to another brand blade with no issues. Overall, I rate the saw as fair after the initial problems with packaging, delivery and quality control where I would give a poor rating."
1,EXPENSIVE TO USE,"Have had mine for three weeks and just installed my third blade today (at a hundred dollars a pop. If you are buying them with expectations of saving money over the abrasive cut off blades , you will surely be disappointed. I have not cut a lot of metal and the metal i have cut has all been mild steel 1/4"" hot roll flatstockAm waiting to hear from a milwaukee but i think i am just going to find out they are what they are.Will most likley be selling this one on ebay if i cannot get Milwaukee to take it back.The first two blades were the Milwaukee blades. The one i put on today was a Morse I bought from Amazon last week for 138.00"
4,Well Built,"With the exception of the rubber feet, this saw appears to be well built with a good fit and finish. Cuts very nice leaving a smooth edge with little debri and no dust, particlalry when compared to the abrasive blade versions of this saw. So far no issues with the blade, but they do warn that you should cut slow and start with the thinnest part of the metal first. For example barstock should be edge up, not flat. The blade also warns against cutting rebar, but other blades that are available for this saw claim to cut rebar, but I have not tested them. Besides the rubber feet, that will not likely last, the only other issue I have with the saw as that the fourth hold in the base (rear) is blocked by the saw's assemble, which can make it very difficult to mount on the foldable typ saw stands. If not for this bit of laziness from Milwaukee's engineers it would have been given five stars, so it you don't need that hole, consider this a five star saw."
2,HEAVY...BUT GETS OLD FAST...,"Honestly,I only bought this because the name of the band was very original. The guitar,drums,and vocals are nothing we haven't heard a thousand times before. Nothing but growling and the same guitar in every song. To bad the CD isn't as original as the name. SORRY GUYS! nothing great here."
3,Horror Classics Vol. 9 - ID#14309,"Four movies on one discHorror Classics Vol. 9 - Platinum Disc ID#14309#1: The Satanic Rites of Dracula - 1973 - Director: Alan Gibson#2: The Terror - 1963 - Director: Monte Hellman, Jack Hill#3: Mutant - 1983 - Director: John 'Bud' Cardos, Mark Rosman#4: Dead Men Walk - 1943 - Director: Sam NewfieldAll in all; decent picture, decent sound. Nothing special, but menus all seem to work and thats rare for cheap compilation DVD's.These movies are available individually from amazon, so you can see actual reviews and movie details if you search for the title under DVD's."
4,"Great copy of ""Satanic rites...""","To Me, the transfer of ""Satinic rites..."" is great. It seems to be really letterboxed. There is no hiss. The colors are vibrant. There are no artifacts. Compared to an Alpha copy I had this is a ten.Many people think this is a weak Hammer film. I disagree. It is very entertaining."
4,They`ve almost done it again!,"After listening to ""Halfway down the Sky"", I just couldn`t wait for Splender to release another album. It`s always hard to follow up a superb first release, but I really think they have managed to create a classic yet again! I rate this album as a a very strong four-star.Their first single from this album was ""Save it for Later"", which in my opinion is perhaps the weakest track on the entire album. Don`t get me wrong, it is still an ok song. But other songs like ""But, Anyway"" and the opening track ""Happier this Way"" is almost magical. Splender has matured from writing rather melancholic songs, into more edgier rock, an appropriate term would be ""songs with an attitude"". Just listen to ""The Loneliest Person I Know""....wow, such sad lyrics, but with such a ""happy"" melody, it`s just great! That kinda runs through the entire new album....they are ""Happier this Way""!!!"
1,Not what they are capable of...,"I wrote a great review for this album when it first came out right here on Amazon, I said this album was a must by. Now I realize I was just excited that Splender finally released a second album. After going back and listening to the album, I realized it very boring and repetitive. Then going back listening to the FIRST album, I realized To whom it may concern is awful. It just isnt Splender, it was made to try to make them famous. Splender should stick with what they are good at-making good music. This however, is far from what they are truly capable of. If you want real music, pick up the first album, Halfway Down The Sky."
4,Hardest Working Band title reassured,These guys are known as the hardest working band out there and it shows. No stupid songs that shouldn't be there...all are worthy of airtime. I breathed a sigh of relief after listening through the first time because I was worried they can't match the 1st album. The guitar melodies are so creative and Boone's voice as striking as Halfway Down the Sky. The songs are somewhat poppier which is why I rank it 4 stars instead of 5. Splender is probably the most underrated band in this genre.
2,Wanted it to be GREAT,"This is one of those cd's I expected to rock, since the first splender CD blew me away--and I mean every song--this album just doesn't have that dark, catchy feel to it. The lyrics fall flat, and that seriously saddens me, because I waited so long for it to come out. The last song on the cd is the only good cut, and captures the feel of Splender. The rest are dull, and not worth the time. Hope the guys come out with something from a label who understands them, cause J Records doesn't."
5,An Incredible Album,"I loved ""Halfway Down the Sky"" and was anxiously waiting for Splender's latest release. I was not disappointed at all! ""To Whom It May Concern"" is a great album. It is hard to find an album where every song on it is good. Splender has now done it two times in a row. You will love every song. My only complaint is how short the album is. I can't remember the last time I bought a CD with only 10 tracks on it. However, you are more than compensated by the quality of the music. It is hard to get the songs out of your head. The writing and recording are top notch.I hope the marketing people at J Records get to work and promote this album. There is no reason why every rock-and-roll radio station in the country does not play this music. People need to hear this album."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Them","I was quite excited to hear that Splender was coming out with a new album. When it came out I never heard one song on the radio, and I still haven't. Which is funny because on this album I think they tried to get more of a fan base and more publicity by leaning more toward pop songs. They kept their same sound, but polished them up too much. They are a way better sounding band on Halfway Down the Sky. There was more variety on that album, which this one lacks. After a while into the cd, it sounds like you heard that song earlier. I think this will be an album where you have to listen to it a lot in order to like. They need to be themselves and do thier own thing like they did on Halfway Down the Sky."
3,SO SO...,"This is a descent book, the price isn't bad. I don't look at it much anymore and have found other books to be stronger and more visually creative/inspirational. I didn't know much about the artist when i purchased it, so that may the reason why I feel it is only a descent book.It has some great color uses, vary vibrant, but different from what I imagined it was going to be overall. It's a nice book to have around on the coffee table."
5,"gripping read, at the intersection of personal history and cultural history","I stumbled on ""Our Father Abe: The Story of a Deaf Shoe Repairman"" at the library looking for memoirs and passing the local history display.It's a gripping read! the authors, Abe's two children, have done an excellent job of storytelling, with a frank and graceful touch.This is a book poised at the intersection of personal history and cultural history. Abe (born 1900s to Russian Jews) lost his hearing before acquiring language, then went on to experience everything Jews in the 20th c. emigrating from Europe & landing in the midwest went through, but with the challenge of deafness in tow.This book would be of interest to the Deaf community as much as it is to the Jewish community or to memoir writers like me.A testament to the personal desire to publish, and the good that can radiate into the world from such a desire."
5,"Wonderful book for young kids, extremly action packed","In this first book in the series, you meet Benny, Henry, Jessie and Violet, four children whose parents have died and have no where to go. They find an abandoned boxcar and call it home. The end is more surprising than you can imagine."
2,Meet the box car children,"The book name was the adventures of ""Benny and Watch"".I think this book would be good for other people to read but it was a mystery story and I don't like mystery stories."
2,Ehhhhh....,"This book had very little to reveal about Masonary or Magic. The author does include copies of spells he uses with brief discriptions of how to use them, but over all the book lacked any real meat."
5,The open secret,"Great book - easy to read, humorous, personal insights, well qualified author, and great references! I'm not going to synopsize the book and ruin it for you but if you have an open, questing mind this book is for you! The reason I put Open Secret in the title is that the big secret really is something taught by many other eastern and mystical religions, it has just been hidden from Christians, Muslims, and Jews by clergy who want to control everyone else."
4,"Great Prog cd...but ""Dream Dancer"" is needed>?",True Steve this is awesome! And I have some news regarding Dream Dancer...it was released in Europe as an extra track to the cd single for Lonely! I had the single but sold it awhile back. I think Dream Dancer is one of their finest moments but felt it belonged on the Transcendence release not the premiere. Go search the web for the cd single for Lonely and good luck! I have the tune on tape from the cd as well and try to take care of but hey everything must die!Good Luck and let me knwo if ya find it!
5,Toad Rage CDs,"I was very happy with the Toad Rage CDs. They came in very good condition. I was happy that the one ""reading"" the book had either an English or Australian accent. It was very appropriate considering the setting of the book takes place in Australia."
4,$7 for a &5 book???,"I love this book. It was one of the first YA books I ever read, and it hooked me into the genre. It's funny, original, and just a joy to read. Now that being said, $7 for a digital version of a $5 book? What's up with that?"
4,Great stethoscope for a low price...,My son was diagnosed with asthma at 6 months. It is sometimes hard to hear if he is wheezy. So we purchased this stethoscope to help us listen to his breathing. It is inexpensive and works for us. It also is a bright orange which I love. So if you have a child that has breathing disorder I would totally recommend this.
2,Can't hear,I know these are the cheap disposable ones but you can't hear much of anything through them. They seem to be built well enough but you still can't hear much.
2,You get what you pay for....,"I purchased this because I am tired of borrowing my mother's Stethoscope. She is a nurse and she has one of those over priced Littman stethoscopes she uses at work in the hospital. My daughter has asthma and we use it daily to see if she is wheezing, and to check if she is moving her air well.I figured how bad could this be? The price should have tipped me off. The sound is very ""tinny"", like hitting the side of an empty pop can. Plus it's way too low. You cannot make out any breath sounds and even barely the heartbeat. I will be returning it promptly. The only plus I can think of is the neon pink color is very cute, and the stethoscope itself is very lightweight. I cannot recommend this to anyone at all for home use, and definitely not in a professional medical setting.I will continue to search for a middle ground in price and quality for a home-use stethoscope, but this is definitely bottom of the barrel."
2,Disappointed!,"I have read all the ""Cowboy"" books Mr. Greenwood has authored - and thoroughly enjoyed them! So really looked forward to the Latest - ""Luke"". What a disappointment! I have read over half of this book and find its just too improbable to be interesting. The premise of a foreign princess traveling across the Arizona desert with Luke was too much of a stretch!. I do hope there will be more ""Cowboy"" stories and I will be the first to purchase them - but hopefully they will be more in the genre of the first books!"
5,Deeply Spiritual..,"What a gem this book is, published so many years after Grace Cooke's death. It may be the most important spiritual book I've ever read...I've been reading White Eagle Books for almost 20 years now, and recommend them all."
3,I know who Paris voted for...,"This was a super-militant release from the Black Panther rapper. The album is feverishly anti-Bush in its message.Paris uses militant beats to match up with militant raps; however, it's not quite on par with Public Enemy's work at the time.It's quite good in its conscious efforts. Overall some songs are off the target, but there are a few good keepers.This was very shocking for its time - Paris had a hard time getting any press as the government wanted his releases silenced.So this album becomes more interesting now that Bush is president, again. It's worth the cheap used price."
3,not so thrilled,I paid more money for this particular scanner as it claimed to do slides...it doesnt..all i get is a black screen.directions aren't all that clear and i have not been satisfied.
1,haven't been able to scan a single negative,"I bought this scanner because it was cheap and from a company which I like but so far haven't been able to scan a single 120 negative. EVERY SINGLE SCAN comes out completely wrong or not at all. I don't mind the loud noise problem if my scans were actually coming out good. Most have terrible lines and noise. Half the time I get errors saying it couldn't scan.If I hadn't thrown away the box and reciept before really trying it, I would have returned it in a heart beat.Very disapointing."
5,Epson is a winner!,"The Epson line of scanners, especially the 4490 Perfection is a breeze to use with top notch results"
4,upgraded from epson 4180 to 4990,"We have had an Epson scanner since 2006, recently it just didn't perform like it should, so we bought the equivalent Epson 4990. The scanner is great, but the software that came with it is much to be desired.It has Presto bizcard which we cannot use on ANY of our computers. We have a Windows 7 PC and 3 Mac's(bizcard only works with windows, only not 7). Also it came with Adobe Photoshop Elements 2, which there is a current version 8.This is truly an insult. Just beware if you just want to use the scanner it's a great tool, otherwise the software is antiquated."
2,Mac Intel users beware!,"I bought this item and have experienced none of the loud sounds or lid issues however after my first batch of 5 or six scans, which went beautifully and yielded great scans, the software crashed. I use the latest iMac with Intel processor. I could no longer power the scanner! I spent quite a while with an Epson tech support personell who did speak english without an accent. He walked me through several possible conflicts and we uninstalled things deep under the hood only to find that it now worked but with half the functionality (the buttons on the face were no longer functional). Then on the very next use of the scanner the software crashed anyways! Oh well. I've even tried to install the latest drivers. Nothing! Now i've got to figure out a way to drive this machine to see if can continue putting out great imagery without making a terrible sound that everyone talks about."
4,Review of Epson Perfection 4490 Photo Scanner,"To date this unit has been used primarily on old black and white 120 negatives. Results have been good to excellent in most cases, but in some instances dark areas will exhibit poor definition and show up as undefined black patches on the displayed image and is impossible to correct.The other problem found was with ease of access to the copy function. Previous models of Epson scanners have been controlled by software such as Epson Smart Panel which creates a location from which all functions are easily reached. In this instance the 4490 is a step backward."
2,Flimsy - for single sheets only,"The scans are good, yes. But the glass is adhered with double-stick TAPE. Three tiny tabs on one side were clearly meant to align the glass during assembly -- the glass is ONLY affixed to the thin plastic frame by TAPE. If you try to put anything heavier than a newspaper on it or, God forbid, try to put a book on there and have to press down a little to flatten the binding, the glass WILL PRY LOOSE. And DON'T PRESS DOWN WHEN YOU CLEAN THE GLASS! I have never seen such an underbuilt scanner."
3,Not too bad a value.,"Epson Perfection 4490 Photo ScannerI bought this scanner as a second scanner - primarily for the ability to scan photo negatives. It does work quite well for this purpose. It is a little on the ""cheaply made"" side, but all in all it meets my current needs."
1,so far its garbage.......,"Been working with it for about an hour, have not been able to scan one negative or slide, it makes so much noise it sounds like it runs on steam, troubleshooting software is worthless, and the instructions are a poster! Can someone who's had some success with this thing help me out here? If not this thing is going back."
3,Think Twice about Epson Products,"Some might call this sour grapes but I think it more of a ""buyer beware"" warning that I wish I had known about before I bought the Epson Scanner.Epson will not provide downloads of the bundled software that came with this scanner. I bought a scanner and we had a basement flood. The scanner was fine but the box it came in (along with software) was tossed with everything else that was on the ground. I now find that Epson wants to charge to replace rather than allow a download. I am not the only one with this problem. Just google epson smart panel download and you will see what I mean. Smart Panel is the software that makes it work.Caveat emptor folks, Buyer beware."
4,Professional Scanner,This scanner is a great investment. I've had Epson scanners for years and this one was a gift. I've had my Epson scanner for seven years and it's running strong.
3,For 35mm Positive Slides,"The first one arrived ""broken"" (the scanner slide stayed locked; that reduced it two stars). I decided to send it back and try another one. On the second try, all worked. I have processed about 20 slides, previous Amazon wisdom from reviewers proved invaluable (search for 35mm under reviews for best settings & artifact info). The scans are not like the original, but good enough for my naked eye! All in all, it is great for the money."
1,Ivory-billed woodpeckers sound better than this...,"I bought one of these and the first one made the ""horrible racheting noise"" another reviewer mentioned, and from that point made striped and distorted scans. I thought it had been damaged in shipping, and made arrangements to return it, and ordered another. Things happen.The new one arrived today, and I installed it. It scanned beautifully and perfectly...the first 7 pieces of art. Then the horrible noise started up again, and I have stripes instead of artwork.NOW what?! Try again? Give up? I am afraid I'm thinking it is badly misnamed--it should be called the Epson IMperfection.I gather that when they work they're wonderful...but two lemons in a row does nothing for my confidence. I need a good, dependable scanner, and so far my experience has been very negative."
4,"Good scanner, but poor Epson service","When the scanner was first plugged in, the scanning bar was catching and grinding. Even though it was a new product, Epson had no 800 number for tech support. You must pay. The technician initially suggested that I return the product to Amazon. I suggested a local repair facility. When the machine was taken in to the local Epson repair shop, they said, ""Oh, yeah, we have three others just like this one."" It seems that Epson was shipping this model with a lose glass scanning bed. They must have know about the problem. The repair shop at first told me the necessary part was on back order for a month. When I protested, they were able to have the local rep replace the machine (a scanner in which the defect has now been remedied). I was just annoyed that Epson allowed distributors to sell a defective machine."
1,Don't Buy an Epson 4490,"When I tried using the FIRST Epson 4490 scanner I brought home, it made a horrible racheting sound and the top of the items I was scanning were smeared out and distorted. I assumed it had been damaged during shipping and exchanged it for another. The SECOND Epson 4490 I brought home, would not even scan. I would get a message that it was warming up and the lamp would come on and then promptly turn off. I would not recommend this scanner! It is not worth the headache."
1,Limited Windows 7 support,"Buyer beware. I don't usually write reviews, but Epson is selling this product without fully supporting Windows 7 with updated scanner utility software. The scanner driver is available for Windows 7 and works fine for basic scanning, but you will not (at least as of 4/9/2011) be able to use the buttons on the scanner front panel if your computer is running Windows 7.Latest information... after multiple email exchanges with Epson and no answers, I elected to load the Creative Suite and Copy Utility software that supports Windows Vista per the online Epson program descriptions. The Creative Suite installs okay and now the scanner buttons work except the COPY button which is the one I use the most (...or used to use when it work with WIndows XP). Also note that the EMAIL button has always only worked with Outlook Express which of course is no longer provided in Windows 7. So, needless to say I'll likely try another brand next time I shop for a scanner."
4,Epson Scanner 4490,I am very pleased with the product. I use it for scanning both opaque graphics and 35mm and 2 1/4 x 2 1/4 transparencies. I never use the holders for the mounted transparencies allowing me to scan more at once. I then separate them with the cropping tool in Photoshop. HINT! If the first slide in the row is too close to the top of the light slot the scanner will treat the material as opaque.
5,Works Better Than I Would Have Thought Possible!,"I was going to buy one of the 100 dollar Sharper Image/ Hammacher-Schlemer type single slide scanners but after checking around on the web decided to go with the Epson 4490. It honestly works better than I would have thought possible.Speed is not bad, images are great, setup went well. I have scanned about 100 slides without a hitch so far. I guess I should have written this review after scanning the thousand slides that I eventually have to do but so far I must say that I couldn't be happier.For the price, this unit works great."
1,Serious Software Problems,"I relegated my Microtek scanner to my Win 98 computer because the company refuses to update the software to guarantee compatibility with Win XP. My Epson 980 inkjet printer has worked extremely well for a long time, and the software update for XP works fine. However, just a month or two after installing the Epson 4490, the software stopped working. I uninstalled and reinstalled, with no success. I downloaded and installed the latest driver (dated 10/06), but still the software remains nonfunctional, simply putting a blue strip in the left corner of the desktop with options of minimizing, moving, or closing. I would (and will) check users' opinions of both hardware and software combined, relative to scanners, and not trust editorial reviews alone, none of which mentioned the software problems. (A problem with editors' reviews is that they frequently do not reflect moderately longterm use of the product so that problems that emerge over a few weeks or months go unreported.)"
4,Epson 4490,"It works well. I've had some frustrations with it telling me it is locked when it isn't. Fortunately, we have a technical staff that can get it past that."
4,New to Epson Scanner,"I haven't had a chance to really use the Epson Scanner too much. After a bit of research and other people's comments, I decided to go with the Epson. I was using an old Acer scanner before. I ordered this for the church, where I work. I mainly use the scanner to scan other people's articles that they have typed up to place in our announcements. It works great for this."
3,confusion within Amazon,"The product was OK (Just a loose part which I had to epoxy, probably voiding any warrenty) and the seller was efficient. However, there was a great deal of confusion within Amazon. Amazon recredited my card and then couldn't seem to get the situation straight when I corrected them. Different people (3) e-mailed me. I asked that a manager call me so as to be able to straighten things out with a person of responsibility, but no one did. To this day I am not sure if I was double charged for the item due to Amazon's imcompetence. I hope to find out what happened when I receive the next credit card statement. More my follow."
1,A very bad purchase!,"A very bad purchase! The unit arrived with the glass plate loose and a plastic piece floating around in the inner compartment; it was dirty and scratched, defiantly not as described.There were no manuals, there were to be 2 CD, they were not there. After an eMail to the shipper, he decided that he no longer wanted the unit and said not to ship it back to him. To say the least this was a bad purchase. You have returned my money and things are fine with you and me at this time."
1,Do not Buy this Product,I just recently purchased this product which comes with Adobe Photoshop Elements v2.0 with the scanner. While the scanner is working the Adobe software is so old that it will not work. Called Epson and they told me to call Adobe. Called Adobe and they told me that the version was out of support and they could not do anything for me. Called Epson back and they told me that is what they were provided by Adobe. That is a racket if I ever saw one. I would not have purchased this product if I had known that the software inside was 6 years old and not even supported anymore.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I will not buy an ESPON product again as they want to give away worthless CD's
1,"Bad tech support, Issues with communication with USB port","This scanner gave me a lot of headache. Since the first time I used it, it intermittently stops working issuing an error message of ""can not properly communcate with scanner. etc.."" So every time I scan something I am very nervous hoping it could get through. Sometimes to be able to finish scanning 10 pages of document I will have to restart the scanner three times. When talked to tech support(supprisingly EPSON doesn't have 1-800 number for their customer to contact them) for more than 6 hours in total. They pushed me away to contact my computer vendor saying my USB chipset is too basic which doesn't have enough power to drive the scanner. Wow, what a good explaination! Because they think their scanner is so special that normal PC couldn't handle it! I will never buy anything from EPSON anymore"
3,FRUSTRATED WITH EPSON HELP SERVICE,"I purchased an Epson 4490 from Amazon over a month ago, and found the lack of an instruction manual strange; the ""cover sheet"" was pretty skimpy as to details. I had trouble immediately with the manual mode of Epson Twain screen showing up; it simply didn't. In short, over 10 emails to Epson support got me nowhere. I could work it in professional mode, but not having all the features shown in the scanty instructions left me uneasy; I returned it to Amazon, and will look for another brand."
2,Save your clams,"I bought this product despite mixed reviews because my mom has been very happy with the more expensive Epson Perfection 4990 scanner. I unpacked the unit and was generally happy with the look and feel. Scanning a print worked fine. However despite multiple attempts the scanner would not scan slides for me. The first attempt resulted in images that had no correlation with the slides, just a lot of noisy pixels. After that the scanner would work for ten minutes and then report that the document could not be found. Throughout the slide scanning the scanner made horrible intermittent clacking sounds. I have returned the product due to these problems."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"Yes, it scans OK. The film adapters are awkward and hard to use, and made of flimsy plastic.It is noisy and slow, and don't turn on ICE unless you are going out to dinner, because it takes a long time, but, in all fairness, it does an ok job.For the money it's a scanner and it works. For less than 100 bucks I'm making scans. They are not as sharp as I would like, but I'm not ready to spend $500 on the V700. It does 4 slides at a time, or 2 strips of 6 negatives. It also can scan one strip (2 6x6, or 1 6x7, 6x9, or 6x12) of 120 film.Be sure to read the other reviews which talk about NEVER PUTTING ANYTHING HEAVY ON IT, and MAKING SURE IT IS UNLOCKED BEFORE YOU SCAN."
4,Epson Scanner 4490,I find the Epson Scanner easy to use and makes the scanning of the slides and photos an enjoyable task. The Photo Shop Elememts program enhances old slides and photos to better that original quality. I highly recommend it.
3,Compatibile with Mac OS 10.3?,"The scanner has 3 modes of operation: ""auto,"" ""home"" and ""professional. My Apple computer uses Mac OS 10.3.9. I have encountered the following problems: (a) the ""home"" mode does not appear to work at all; and (b) the ""PDF scan"" operation (direct creation of a multi-page PDF file) seems to work only in the ""professional"" mode."
1,Won't Work with OSX and iMac G5,"I have an iMac G5 running OSX.4.4- and the computer could NOT recognize the scanner- not even through Image Capture. I spent hours with Epson support and on the Apple discussion boards, and still got error message saying ""Epson scanner unexpectedly quit."" Took it back today for a CanoScan 8400F- and in minutes was up and scanning."
2,slide scanning very disappointing,"I purchase this product specifically to scan slides after a glowing review I had read. No matter what I try, the image quality is horrible; curved lines are jagged and the image is grainy. I have never had the patience to wait for the higher dpis, for four slides at 4800 dpi, the time frame is 252 minutes. 2400 dpi looks exactly like 800. The color adjustments don't seem to make any difference either. Other functions seem OK."
2,"Poor ""help"" documentation, and 4490 stopped working","While this scanner delivers a rather ""reddish"" tint to the photos, it has, at least worked for some time. Now, it stopped recognizing the 35mm slides. It had been doing that fine in Full Auto Mode. The Q and A's are of no help. The terminology used is incomprehensible. So now I have to replace the 4490, and it won't be with an Epson product."
4,Great for slides and OCR,The scanner has built-in features that help restore old slides. The OCR feature has handled every font size and style that I've encountered so far -- even text on colored background. The only drawback I've enocountered is that it is much slower than my old scanner at doing basic document scans.
2,Horrible for slides,"the scanner does a very good job with prints.but, it is terrible for slides. i've tried every possible setting using the software and, not matter what, scans of 35mm slides are always out of focus.the software included with the scanner has a poor interface and is confusing to use. the ""manual"" is very poor as well.don't buy this scanner if you want to scan slides."
1,Unstable glass,Flimsy design and feels cheap. Plastic around the glass is not solid and is uneven and can't support the glass. The glass is only glued to this frame. Mine was broken when I first opened it and the glass was separated from the frame. I returned it to the store and I saw the demo's glass was loose too. So I did not get another 4490.
2,communication issue,"I also bought the epson after returning an hp deskjet (bad software) because after research found that the AaBbYy OCR was better than the HP bundle.... But one week after installing an error message came up as Unknown device....Fours hours later with long distance call to EPSON and removing and reinstalling software and hooking it up to my lap top !!!! they fianally tell me it is a communication error and might be the USB cable..So I go and purchase another USB cable ,,,,still didn't work ...Took it back to store....Very disappointed ...shoulda kept my ten year old scanner ..."
5,Great Scanner,"I wanted a scanner for documents and pictures and this does both very well. Very satisfied with with this scanner, and would reccomend this to anyone."
1,I will never buy anything from Mvix again,"This is th last time i buy a thing from Mvix. I got two of these media center and one of them keeps freezeing every time i play a movie and sometimes it just hangs up and never reset unless i pull out the power cord plus the fan sound is toooo loud even anoying.The other one is even worse, first when i switch it on there is nothing displayed on the LCD at the front face of the player. Secondly after 30 sec. it switches back off by itself !! plus when i opened it to install the HD i found a loose wire and another one that is not properly soldered into the power cable that connects the HD to the player.Basically, both of them are not servicable !! i tried to contact custmer support at Mvix it took them 2 weeks to answer the claim ticket and even worse they were so cold on the respond. Now i sent the players back to Mvix for replacement and i am afraid i am gonna get another two bad ones again What a service ??"
3,Interesting product...but not compatible with video files from Sony cameras,"Small form factor and quieter than most media center computers. Seems to do a reasonable job with pictures and audio. The remote is a little sluggish and the interface is not pretty, but it works fine.I ran into a problem when I tried to use it to play AVI and MPEG files from my Sony cameras. They would not play and in fact made the system unstable. Support was responsive but explaained that they do not support Sony's codec, so that I would have to transcode everything. Transcoded files work fine, but it not very convenient to add this additional step to the process. I found no indication of this limitation in the documentation, so don't assume that files that play fine in Quicktime or Windows Media Player will work on the Mvix."
2,"Awful, absolutely terrible.","I've tried several similar devices and have to say this is the worst of the lot.Pros:It plays back DVD/ISO files very wellCons:Price point compared to similar products is very highNoisyTerrible wireless network connectivityHorrible user interfaceAdvertising is misleadingTerrible support, no firmware upgrades since May of 2007, despite a large number of complaints.Only supports NDAS ""streaming""No internet radioI took this device back for a refund after a very short period of time. It just wasn't worth the money. I ended up buy a different product with twice the capabilities for much less with excellent support.BTW...this is the only device I've every owned that has an active user group that recommends returning the product before the return policy expires. Seriously."
2,Beware!Does not play HD-media,This player does not play HD-video as it is mentioned.People who buy to view H.264 or MKV file will regret buying this product.Beware!
2,"Well~ if I can do it over again, i will not go for this Product.","this product are very difficult to setup and and have a lot of problems with their Wireless Chip set, if you are not a geek, this thing might take you more then hour to set it up, I don't recommended, if you really want the wireless HD player, I will go go for other brand that is 80.00 cheaper~"
1,No Deadly Kung Fu Lady in this Film,"That is just an average Kung Fu film where male actors do all the fighting.There is one ""evil"" lady who hires a male assasin, but she does not fight herself.The makers of this video make a fake title and cheat the fans of female martial artists who get nothing for their money."
5,excellent product _ simple an dead accurate,"Have this setup for .223, .243, .308, 9mm luger,38 special, 357 mag. Allows you to accurately trim, chamfer, deburr, & and clean case lube off of case when mounted in a cordless drill.Speeds up tedious case prep _ love this product"
4,"Works, leaves the case on the long side.","The gauge does the job with the Lee case trimmer. Use a drill to make the job easier. Mine cuts the case to 2.008"" which isn't bad, most say to trim to 2.005"". SAAMI says the max = 2.015"" so I don't see this as being a problem. The Lee case trimmer and holder are needed to use this."
2,"I was disappointed, but it wasn't the author's fault.","The mistake I made here was judging the book by the cover. I picked it up because I thought the topic was interesting, and I thought it would detail the lives and personalities of the kind of sassy, salty, almost defiant cowgirls like the ones depicted on the cover. I knew next to nothing about the rodeo and never heard of a rodeo queen before, so I thought she was a sort of cowgirl, not a beauty queen. I expected to be taken on a wild ride through the rodeo circuit. But instead I found myself reading a pseudo-feminist treatise on the shallowness of rodeo and the empty mythos of a West that never existed. I found myself disappointed in the subject matter, much as I imagine the author became disappointed when she delved into it. The only thing I wish the author could've done differently was to view the rodeo more as a community of characters and personalities, rather than as an abstract construct."
1,Don't waste your time.,"As a rodeo competitor, rodeo queen, and cowgirl I was at time offended at this book and the terribly untrue and negative it said about rodeo... and the people who embrace the western lifestyle. I only finished the book to hear the rest of what the author had to say. I was excited to start reading it, and disgusted when I was done. If you want to know the real view and role of women in the west you won't find it in this book..keep looking."
4,they are good,I was worried because it said lubricated. I was buying this intended for oral sex. They taste all right. Flavor is good. The price is great too. Came on to purchase more.
3,"Not bad, not great.","I rated this product in the middle of the road. They got the job done and still felt good (this is coming from the guy's point of view). My girlfriend did say that there wasn't really much flavor though, which left her with just the taste of latex... Also, as for the ""variety"" they advertise here, I ordered a 12-pack and they just sent me 6 banana and 6 strawberry: hardly much variation there considering there are three other flavors available. Like I said before, this product is okay, but nothing amazing."
1,Not worth the trouble,"The flavor is not strong an is gone in 2 seconds, better off with an ultra thin lifestyles, and your imagination"
3,not much flavor,"had complaints it smelled too much like latex and had that it didn't really have the advertised flavor, and that latex was too prominent"
3,size,I love the flavors but next time ill order a bigger size ...it almost sufficated but its a pretty good brand. So I expect nothing less then good
4,Performance versus Technology,"One can tolerate Glen Gould's grunting and groaning throughout, as his interpretation of the Bach inventions is outstanding. However, despite Sony's reputation the recording is flawed. The first track (Invention 1 in C major) has a ""tic-tic-tic"" for the first few bars that is unacceptable. Amazon very kindly replaced the disc free of all charges, including freight, but the replacement had the same flaw. I noticed that the disc played OK on my computer so I tried burning a copy. Lo, it was fine on my hi-fi gear so that solved the problem. But take care; why should we have to go to the trouble to make allowances to fix a technical fault when we are paying good money for a faultless one?"
3,Why did you leave us with this Mr. Gould?,"I'm very surprised that no other reviewer here has mentionedthe fact that Gould recorded these pieces with a defective pianothat had at least one clangy key. The piano was so bad that initiallyCBS was going to withhold the release. Fortunately, Gould agreed towrite the liner notes himself and thereby saved the recording fromobscurity. Unfortunately, we are left with a masterpiece of diminishedquality. Certainly this is still a disc that must be owned, but be awareit shows Glenn Gould at his egomaniacal worst.5 stars for the perfomance, 0 stars for the piano."
2,Extremely Poor Audio Quality--The Rice Krispies Inventions,"I have 15-20 Glenn Gould CDs and this is the worst recording quality of the lot. The static and popping make listening to this CD an unpleasurable process despite Gould's virtuosity. Even Gould enthusiasts would be better served purchasing a higher quality recording of the same work from a less accomplished pianist, organist or harpsichordist."
4,8 songs listeed here: Sort of like Manhattan Transfer.,"Vocal Jazz reminiscant of Manhattan Transfer, in my opinion. A little Brazilian vibe is mixed in for good measureHere are the songs:1- OOOPS! (No ""I Did It Again"", does not follow!!!)2- Watch What Happens3- 'Round Midnight4- Hello5- American Eyes6- Storm7- Up From The Skies8- Burn It"
3,Okay could be better,"Purchased this CD for my ds thinking it will be Israeli sounding hebrew. It's is the opposite, it's more of a reform sounding, very american hebrew sounding.Why is it so hard to find a good hebrew sounding CD for children and Toddlers?One of the tracks I think there is a woman singing! A man is not allowed to hear a woman sing, I won't be able to play this CD around the dh!It did keep my little one entertained for a while, but I expected more, the CD is not long enough.If you are looking for regular 'reform' sounding songs, or ashkanzik sounding songs, this is for you. Otherwise, need to get in touch with someone that lives maybe in Israel to send me some normal religous hebrew singing CDs..."
4,a put your feet up and pile on the popcorn movie,"This film is great value. It reminds me of why people went to movie-theatres, sat in the dark and were entertained by having all their buttons pushed in the right way. Unknown Origin falls somewhere between Star Trek and Alien. Considering it was made in 1995 its scientific effects like control panels for example seem sort of 80ish compared to the design wizardry of today. Initially I thought it would turn schmaltzy but not at all. This is because this movie is all about great story-telling through movie- telling It has pace action intrigue humour good drama good sets. It may not be high on originality but sound and well-made."
4,NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER,"I read this book some years ago, and I consider it an eye-opening, illuminating book to those who still do not believe that cultural diferences are extremely important in a relationship. The movie is good but does not explain the real reasons why Betty agree to travel to Iran during a very dangerous time. Any women who plans to marry someone from an islamic country must read this book first!"
3,M.Rizia a student at MLMS- Cambridge Maryland,"NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTERThis book was okay but it was kind of boring during the beginning, but after a while it got better. There wasn't alot of action like I thought it would have. I liked the last part of the book because it got interesting but that was the only thing i liked. I would recommend this book to kids that are in high school because it has alot of big words and it talks about alot of stuff that are for grownups. Overall this book was okay but i wouldnt recomend this book to people who dont like books about relationships."
3,"RP ~ student at MLMS ~ Cambridge, Maryland","(This was a nice book to read)If Betty was trying not to put anyone in harm's way then why did she write this book? In this book Betty explains how she escaped from Iran with detail. From my point of veiw, I would say this book is dangerous for Betty. Even if she made up names, most likely you could tell where the people who helped her because of the located by the area that Betty was in. It was a good thing to know how people could be in Iran towards women."
3,"D.Nichols - student at MLMS - Cambridge, Maryland","In August 1984, Betty Mamoody found herself and her four-year old child Mathob to meet her husbands family for the first time. She found herself and her four year old daughter virtual prisoners of the Shiite Muslium faith, where women are slaves. Their only hope is to escape her husband and find a safe way back to America.I think that this book is excellent. This book shows a woman that cares for her child and will do anything for her. Betty Mamoody is a heroic woman for sacrificing her life to save her and her child's life.I never knew that Iranian woman went through so much and I have sympathy for them. If I were Betty, I'd do anything to save my childs life for a virtual prison! Even at times I found that this book was boring, it has a good plot. I think that this book was out of my usual genre, I enjoyed reading something new and slightly interesting.I must say that you will like it if your into true life stories."
5,A TOUCHING ACCOUNT,"When you read this book focus on the emotions of Betty - far removed from her home country in a country of foreign ways, customs and practices. Maybe then people will be less prone to be so critical."
3,Bns at M.L.M.S,"In this book Betty explains the hardships she faces as she trys to escape a country that has very degrading views on America and women. She has to face the rough task of acting as a dutiful muslim wife, although all she really wants to do is go home and see her real family. I think that this book was a good read, although a little boring the first few pages and especially towards the end. I would recommend it to a more mature audiences and probably more woman than men. I would also recommend it to woman who are visiing Iran."
4,Ty C. - student at MLMS,"This novel ""Not Without my Daughter"" is truly a ""harrowing-breath taking true story of a Mothers courage"".Within this novel it shows a mother's love for her daughter, her will and inner-strength in which she used to overcome the rough obstacles during her eighteen months in Iran. It also shows the braveness and courage of a little four-five year old girl. I really enjoyed this novel. I was also truly inspired by the faith that Betty and Mahtob gave to ""God"". As well as the courage, strength and will they carried amongst themselves in order to escape. (The prison-like cell (their home in Iran) held by a ""Mad Man""-whom was once a loving, caring, nurturing father and husband...Moody.) I would recommend this wonderful, compelling novel to a group of advanced readers from ages 12 and up. It was an inspiration to me and it opened my eyes to the ""way"" of others and their cultures- I hope it will do the same for others as well!"
1,IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY,"Don't you think it's rather odd that the co-author of this book, William Hoffer, is the co-author of another book of it's kind, Midnight Express? Apparently William Hoffer hit gold with Midnight Express in the 70's, so he stuck to his formula: Write a sensational, over-dramatic, one sided, racist book for people who don't and will never know anything else about the middle east. There sure is an audience for it in America!I don't know which one is more sad, the man who feeds on the racism and ignorance of the masses for money and fame, or the masses of racist and ignorant people that don't care to know any better.Thank you Mr Hoffer, I hope your books brought you a great deal success."
2,Cover-up for a bitter truth?!,"The story though interesting to read, is questionable in truthfulness. Most of the book is based on personal revenge(as you could feel all over the book) than personal experience. Here is the situation: you kidnap a charming child from her father, you break a lot of international laws, mixing with smugglers and criminals,... How could you justify yourself? The easiest way out is to depict the ""other side"" as demons to cover your act. The author is very successful at manipulating the otherwise simple facts. She entangles the reader in a web created from her rage and revenge decorated with promise of hope and happiness. A clear conscious? never."
1,taraf,"I read this book several times, and found it very hard to believe. Whilst accepting her husband hit her, what does not convince is the total character change of Dr Mahmoody.He was the all american good guy until he arrived in Tehran. Betty tells us that he poured the alcohol down the sink, and was very pro the revolution, why did she go to Iran? I have privilege of being married to an Iranian man who is totally wonderful. Neither he or his family are anything like the Iranians in the book, but then not all Irish families are like those of Frank Mc Court in Angela's ashes. If you like suspense, action and fiction read this."
1,Sensationalistic JUNK,"Ignorant simplistic racist ethno-centric claptrap - about as factual a description of Iran as a Hollywood action movie, perpetuating the same dehumanizing standard stereotypes about ""Middle Eastern men"" and their ""subservient women."" Intended for the crowd that can barely find Iran on a map, and knows nothing about the country other than some general cliches about the Mideast in general. I could name many many people in abusive marriages in the USA, are we supposed to draw conclusions about all Americans based on that? If you want to REALLY know something about the status of women in Iran, I suggest reading ""The Women of Deh Koh"" by Erika Friedl, who is a trained anthropologist who lived for many years in Iran. ..."
1,Who are these people who loved this book?????,"This book is sensationalist trash at its worst, and the book and subsequesnt movie have poisoned the millions of educated people who now share this woman's vile distaste for another culture. I am an Iranian American who sees both sides of two great cultures. I have been to Iran, and it is not the hell hole this woman would have you believe - she was in a bad marriage and has chosen to deal with it by looking at his culture. Maybe he as a man was flawed, not his culture?"
1,richie woolfolk is better than David at basketball (mlms),"In the book ""Not Without My Daughter"" Moody kidnaps Betty and takes her to Iran with him and she has to try to escape and she has to find a way that she can bring her daughter with her back to America but the woman said that she cannot take Mahtob. Also I'm pretty sure this is the worst book ever written. I don't like it at all because it's so boring and I have better things to do. I think Moody is really weird and I think Betty lied about the whole book. I recomend this to others if you have no life and you dont have anything better to do."
1,Two Thumbs Up for Racism,"The author is just a racist person who takes advantage of the political crisis to make herself rich.One question Ms. Mahmoody: Why haven't you changed your name if you think iranians are savage people? Let me tell you why, because if you had done so you couldn't stay famous and rich.( I wonder how a bunch of savage people who just take a bath once in a month(!) can have a 7000 years old civilization??? )This is just an insult to the American mentality and a prostitution of pen and English literature.!!! I am actually AWED how some people can give 5 stars to this book !!!"
2,Jp Lesko the coolest cat (mlms),"Well I thought the book was to long to read for a kid. I did not really get it. It was kind of like she just woke up, ate breakfest, took matod to school, and then went home. It was to long for the things she just did. Betty could have done something fun or some stuff like that instead of just sat in a room and cry all day. I she knew she was going to leave some day. So I dont think it was a very good book because it is not what I am in to. I dont recommend this to anyone into sports and motocross racing."
2,She should have done her homework....,"All I can think is, the woman was a fool to not have done her homework before marrying this guy--homework on his family and on his country and on his religion. I know someone who went through a similar experience in spite of family and friends pleading with her--her head was turned by his flattery, just as Betty Mahmoody's was. Not saying she deserved what happened, but she made a stupid choice to marry him."
1,napoleon dynomite(d.c.) at mlms,"In the book ""Not Without My Daughter"" Betty Mahmoody goes to Iran with her husband and her daughter. Her husband,Moody, keeps her there with the help of the Iranian law. She is told that she can go back to America, but she cant bring her daughter,Mahtob, with her. She fights to escape Iran with her daughter to go back to America. I did not enjoy the book. It was a very boring and i would recomend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Iran. I would recomend this because it told the reader alot about Iran and the landscape of it."
1,a review from cmg a student at mlms,Not with out my daugther iss the story of Betty Mahoody's time in Iran and how a once gentle american man turned back to his abusive Iranian personality and tries to keep his wife in Iran with him she later escapes. Idid not like the book because it was one sided and does not tell the story from Moodys point of veiw
1,not without my daughter,I didn't really like this book because it did not really grab my attention like most of the books I usually read but they did have some really intresting parts of the story that I did like!
1,Only In America,"Only in America can a woman write a book, claim this or that is how she got out, and people believe it. Without proof too. I think anyone who doesn't question it is one of those people that other people call ""dumb Americans"" or is so naive it is the kind of people I want on my ""buy the book list"""
5,EXHILARATING!!!!!!!!,"I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN THE MOMENT I STARTED READING IT. I'VE ALREADY LENT THE BOOK OUT TO SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AND THEY ALL SAY THE SAME AS I DO. THANK GOD SHE HAD THE WILL, STRENGTH AND COURAGE TO SURVIVE AND ESCAPE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO BETTY AND HER DAUGHTER, THEN AND NOW."
2,not without my daughter,I didn't really like this book that much because it did not grab my attention like most of the books I usually read.It did have some really interesting parts of the story that I did like.the one thing that I did not like about the story is that it is really gross!
5,It gives too much informations,"(Sorry for the mistakes, I'm not completely bilingual.) I know this is an old book, but isn't it dangerous to give so much informations about her evasion ? Specially for the persons who helped her pass the frontier ? I mean, she explained to whom she talked, where she stopped and everything she did to escape from Iran. Even if she changed the names, isn't it too explicit ? I think it gives too much information to Iranian police and It probably caused difficulties to the others who wanted to escape like she did."
5,Nerve-wracking,"Don't read this book when you go to bed if you want to get a peaceful night's sleep. Its tense, but never a dull moment. I love true stories and this is one of the best.Betty's Iranian husband was medically trained in the US and was an anesthesiologist. I have never heard of anyone going to an anesthesiologist for a mental problem, unless they beg to be euthanized and put out of their misery. The reviewer from London, UK also says maybe Betty's attempts to escape Iran was the cause of her husband's anger and abuse. Well, since her husband had promised they were only going for a 2-week visit to Iran to visit his family, and then held her against her will there, I think she had the right to be very angry herself. Too bad she couldn't give back some of the beatings he gave her. Also, Betty said they bathed every two months, not once a year.I marvel at Betty's determination and courage. She was lucky to have such honest, kind, Iranians, Kurds and Turks to help her get home to America."
5,No Way Out,The book not without my daughter is a very good book. It is thrilling and heart beating. This was a book that got me hooked on it and when I read it I did not want to put it down. This is a sad story and no ladie should be treated the way Betty was treated. I think it takes lots of courage to do what Betty did. Betty told a story like no one has ever told a story and this has to hurt and give her pain inside just to tell this story. Put yourself in her shoes and lets think of what we have and cherish it.
5,How Timely,"I read ""Not Without My Daughter"" a few years ago.With terrible everyday news of horrific happenings in Iraq and surrounding countries, this book once again becomes a timely read.I recently re-read it and the sad, sad story took my breath away for a second time.My own true kidnapping which took place in Moscow, January 1992 once again reared it's ugly head as I turned each page of Betty Mahmoody's book.I take my hat off to anyone who can survive any tragedy,if you have, give yourself a pat on the back.It's no mean feat.-Yvonne BornsteinAuthor, Eleven Days Of Hell - My True Story of Kidnapping, Terror, Torture and Historic FBI and KGB Rescue"
1,True Story?,"I wonder if this is a TRUE STORY as it says it is. Betty, dear, proof proof and more proof should be required before anyone believe any of your words. I think you probably know what I mean. I hope your daughter will see it for what is was and is."
1,"Horrible Trash - If You Liked It, Get a Life","What garbage. Ms. Mahmoudy (why don't you change your name Betty?) meets a crazy man and proceeds to blame the country, culture and everything else. How tragic that an ancient civilization has to stand the wrath of a ""good story"" no matter how inaccurate and vile. Thanks also to Sally Field for further popularizing this piece of garbage. Betty should educate herself about other cultures, and always remember, these United States were built on the backs of innocent native Americans, so your culture is one of barbarians, not the Persian culture."
1,Shameful,"What a shame American presses allow accusations without proof. What parts will the state dept. verify? I dare say probably very little except maybe they might have had the report given to them by the writer. Proof Betty, proof. Anyone can write these adventure stories. But prove it. The silliness about keeping private the names of those involved is used WAY TOO MUCH these days! You chose and then you regretted it. Marrying a doctor is a big deal to you perhaps. Controlling how he believed and where he wanted to live seemed to be your main focus. We hope you are not still trying to control your child's mind, but it's a guess you probably are and oh, yes, we really have no proof of that. This book seems to be a below zero to some because maybe too many people really know the truth...oh, but we have no proof of that either! :)You know Islam is a belief of peace, love and devotion to the Creator when it is the correct Islam...and you couldn't live like that???"
2,"-*KeL.MiL* Cambridge, MD- Book Review-","""Not Without My Daughter"" is a book about a woman who is married to an Iranian man. They have a daughter named Mahtob. They go to Iran to vist Moody's side of the family. They go originally for a two week vacation, but it turns out to be a two year long stay and total chaos. Betty doesn't try hard enoug to escape from Iran. She gets beat my Moody and has a lot of problems with the country. This book is too long and not a good book to read for people in middle school. I would not recommend this book to anyone because it isn't a well written book. It is very drawn out and Betty says too much and things that should not be said. Overall, this book is very, very bad."
4,An interesting novel,"NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER was an interesting book.... once they escaped which took quite a while. To start with, Betty Mahmoody wasn't a writer, so I'm not blaming her for the book not being a fabolous work of literature. At some parts I couldn't put the novel down with the excitment and at some points I was so disgusted and bored I felt like throwing the thing out the window. She shouldn't have described everyday in such great detail, considering each day was so much the same. I found it interesting, however, when Betty and Mahtob escaped, and I also admired Betty for not leaving her little girl behind no matter how bad everything got."
3,DC-MLMS-Cambridge Maryland,"The book Not Without My Daughter was a very good book. It taught me how other people in Iran live. Like in the first few chapters it was talking about how when they arrived in Iran, they had to hide their American passports because they would have taken them and not given them back. Also in the book it states how religious most people in Iran are and how serious they take their religion. I gave this book three stars because in the middle of the story it started getting boring. Plus I didn't like how Moody started treating Betty once he got back to his family and back to Iran. For example when Moody took Mahtob(Betty's daughter) from Betty and didn't allow Betty to see her I thought that was wrong of him even if in Iran men have all the power over the women. If you haven't read this book I encourage you to read this story even if you don't have much time because it makes you realize that you are blessed to have freedom especailly if you are a female."
5,Somewhere in the Middle,"I just recently read the book Not Without My Daughter. I own the movie and have seen it many times. I agree with the person who said we weren't there and cannot say it didn't happen, but I also agree with the people who have positive things to say about Iranians. When I was a teenager, during the time that Betty was in Iran, two very sweet Iranian college students took my Italian cousins out to dinner and a date and they treated them very good. They were very polite to my cousins and my cousins had a good time. I think there are good people in every culture and every society. Another good book that shows the positive side of Iran and it's people that I highly recommend is Honeymoon in Purdah an Iranian Journey by Alison Wearing."
5,Brilliant but...........................,"If what the Iranian person who is living in the UK is saying is the truth, that Betty Mahmoody was a mental patient of her husband I find that quite shocking, and am quite disgusted that it wasn't mentioned in the book, as yes, it is quite an important fact that we should have been informed of.I found the book itself quite interesting, I couldn't stop reading it, and I thought that Betty was quite a courageous person. But why has she kept the surname of a man who held her hostage???"
4,"Great story of survival, a must-read for women","A great book. I couldn't put it down and finished it all in less than 96 hours. Beautifully written, very touching and moving.Very engaging as well.I'm an Arab and I can't understand why so many other Arab readers are annoyed by it. Betty gives a fair account of her story.She has however missed out on some important details, like very imporant religious events in Iran that she did not mention at all. But maybe they were not relevant to her story.Yet overall I still hold the opinion that it is a great book."
4,Not Without My Daughter: A True Story of Courage,"""Not Without My Daughter"" is an intense novel concerning some of the most horrific challenges a mother could ever face. Betty Mahmoody was held hostage in Iran with her 5 year-old daughter, Matob. Her husband who was formally from this tyrant land had just returned to the faith of the Isalm religion. I thought her story was amazing. The trials this mother had to face day after day in a world that loathed Americans blew my mind. I kept putting myself in her shoes throughout the book and comparing myself with her. I would have to say I definitely wouldn't have had as much courage as she did. This novel is so great mainly because of the fact that it gives so much hope to almost any situation in life. If she could make it through all that, we can make it through hard times too!"
5,Stunning!!! A Real Eye Opener........,"This book is a must for women everywhere. It shows real courage in the face of deception. Betty Mahmoody describes life, as she experienced it, within the confines of both Islam and Iran. Most women (especially American women) do not know that such treatment of women in other lands and other religions exists. Having been in a similar situation myself, although thankfully I had previously read Betty Mahmoody's book, I, at least, was somewhat knowledgeable on what the circumstances would be outside of American jurisdiction and knew enough not to leave American soil. This book takes you from a somewhat gentile life in America to that of a chatoic life experienced within Iran. Your heart will be pounding with each encounter of a new persona in Betty Mahmoody's book. The book is a definite page-turner and will haunt you long after you have finished reading it."
5,very happy,"I loved reading the book. I saw the movie and wanted to read the book. It was about a young woman who was tricked into going with her husband into Iran. Her husband decided to stay in Iran and she and her daugther were trapped in country that hated them. As a woman she had no rights and did not want her daugther to be raised there. In the end, she and her daugther escaped. It came when it was supposed to and I was very happy with the book."
3,Not Without my Daughter student at MLMS - CJ.,"In the story "" Not Without My Daughter "" is about Betty, Moody, and their daughter Mahtob. They go to Iran to meet Moody's family for two weeks, but the two weeks are up and they are being held captive as hostages. I enoyed the book because they had both good and bad points and it made me keep reading. I would recommend the book to students in middle school."
2,S.H.- student at MLMS middle school - Cambridge Maryland,"This was a unique book. Once you start reading it you don't want to stop reading. What got me was that it was a true story. How her lovely husband, took her and her daughter to Iran and wouldn't let them leave. Although I only like horror, it was okay for a grade. I recommened this book to a person who has the time to read it."
1,Ridiculous,"Ridiculous to publish anything like this. Sounds as if a vengeful writer just can't let go of her mistake in life. How many marriages does it take to know you need help in relationships? How much control some women want. Even of their own children. Personally I saw the whole situation as a matter of control by both parties. A lot of people have custody battles. The Dr. did what he had to do to try to secure his parental rights too didn't he? Didn't he realize that if the writer filed for divorce that she would use the child as a leverage for alimony and support? After all he was a doctor and Betty was, well, what? I give the man credit for at least trying to keep his child in the only avenue he had to do that. Why isn't a ""0"" offered in these reviews?"
1,PaulDX???,"Read Paul DX's review. Interesting that he/she might consider anyone that did not like this book to have ""no heart-like Mahmoody"" Rather a ludicrous suggestion to me. Since there is only a one-sided account of supposed abuse and accusation, I would suggest that the book should have been a fiction, so as not to confuse the readers. When actual proof can be presented for someone's experiences then readers can actually make an opinion. Otherwise I would certainly hate for someone like PaulDX to be on any jury in this country. I thought the book was useless unless it sustained the proof of the tale."
5,Gripping..,"To start with, i knew very little about Iran- i knew about their political problems of course, but hardly anything about the people and their culture as such..so this book was REAL good from that point of view. I do sympathize with Betty for all that she went through- and this made for some real interesting reading- but i think her claims regarding her daughters lack of love for her father are hard to digest; i would say that this much is exaggerated at least. Nevertheless, its a real gripping book- i just couldn't put it down. When i reached the end, i wished that it had gone on forever (i'm sure Betty Mahmoody would disagree!)"
4,"Great book, I couldn't put it down!","This book was amazing, it was hard to put it down, I read it day and night! Though I found Betty to be occasionally annoying with her complaints with the Iranian culture, I found her story and her love for her daughter grabbing. This book shows the strong division of cultures and people, and is a great read."
3,SEW- Student at Maces Lane Middle School,"The book ""Not Without My Daughter"" is a book about Betty Mahmoody who is taken to Iran for a two week trip. Then once the two weeks are over her husband, Moody tells them that Iran is going to become their home. Then Betty decides to do whatever it takes to get herself and her daughter out of Iran. Several times a chance of escape comes their way, but none of them will take her daughter. Until they find some smugglers that are willing to take them out of Iran using the most terrifing and dangerous path."
4,"Good story, but some biases",I liked this story. It is a wonderful story of how a woman gets herself out of a situation she doesn't want to be in. I think she shows good intentions towards wanting to get her daughter out of Iran. I do wish I could read the other side of the story from Dr. Mamoody's view point. This book does have some flaws. Ms. Mamoody or her co-writer do make remarks that are bias towards Iranian people. I do think she also at times sounds like the woman scorn. Maybe if she could have just told the story from a viewpoint that didn't show so much derrogatory remarks towards Iranians; it would be more appreciated. I do suggest reading it though.
1,Don't bother unless you want to read a bunch of lies!,"I don't know what Betty Mahmoody was trying to do but it seemed to me as though her sole purpose was to denigrate a beautiful country and a wonderful nation! Putting down Islamic values and being disrespectful towards certain traditions she obviously understands nothing about is not representative of a courageous woman. The many inconsistencies and false facts stated in the book prove that many of the incidents were indeed ""made-up"".As someone who's lived in Iran most of her life (and believe me, that hasn't shadowed my objectivity), I have to say that I'm appalled by this book. This is not a story about courage, it is one about revenge, hatred and discrimination. One Thing I know for sure, this is NOT a true story!"
1,Utter Garbage,"I have never read such trash that depicts a nation as a herd of animals all in all. Just because there is one lunatic in the world, doesn't mean that the whole country is backward and narrow-minded. I wouldn't have minded so much if Betty had kept her complaints strictly in relation to her husband and her husband's family but do not blame an entire nation for what happened to her. A better way to get a cheap thrill is just to watch Jerry Springer. Don't waste your money on this, and if you want to learn something about Iran, then talk to some people about it. It truly saddens me to see people reach such utter garbage disguising itself as modern literature!"
1,uberAmericana meets the Exotic East,"Take all the figures in this painting(The Death of Sardanapalus, 1827 Fine Art Stretched Canvas Poster Print by Eugene Delacroix, 22x17) and dress them up as modern Iranians.You would get this book."
3,ANDY MLMS,This is a very good book.This is helpful if you are going through a tough relationship. IT gives you imformation about Iran and its lifestlyes and thier way of Life.
1,A bad marriage blamed on his race.,"Bettty Mahmoodi's book neglects a few very interesting issues. Worst of all, the fact that an Iranian father could actually love his daughter too. Second, why is it Betty Mahmoodi's foregone conclusion that the U.S. is the best place to raise a kid? Third, did the child Love her father? What if she preferred to be with her dad? I read nothing about the child's feelings about her dad. Fourth, Betty mahmoodi has commited an international crime, a kidnapping. If she had done the same in the U.S. (kidnapped her own child and left from one State to another) she would have been prosecuted!! I guess when it comes to them ""Iranians,"" breaking international laws is just fine, a child loving her Iranian father is weird, with all of our social ills we are the one and only place a child must live in, and of course, if an Iranian loves their child as much as their American parent, it is only because the the Iranian is a vicious barbarian."
5,Great Book,"I love the original Scarlet Pimpernel, so over the years I've tried to track down more of Ms. Orczy's novels. This one is set several generations after the original novel, but still share the adventure and heart of Sir Percy and his gang. If you can find it, give it a try."
1,This one is disappointing!,"Any other book I've ever read of Robin Jones Gunn has been spectacular, but this one is so different! I really enjoyed the book itself, but she ended it to soon. The book had just reached the climax, and then she ends it! With no clue of another one to follow up, I'm disappointed in it. If you enjoy being left in the dark forever read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it! I would, however, read any other books of her's!"
3,Sorry!,"I wrote another review saying that this book was really bad. I didn't fully understand at the time that it was part of a series which went on to explain what happend with them. The book really was good until the end. I still don't think that she ended it in the correct way, but with being able to see what happens with them in the other books it makes this one seem a lot better! Just make sure that you have ""Clouds"" and ""Waterfalls"" handy to read right away!"
3,A sweet book,"I found this little gem in a garage sale and I knew it was a Christian book ~~ and I haven't had much luck finding good Christian romance that doesn't want to make you gag. This is a really fun book ~~ it reminds me of my dating days before I married my husband and our singles' group. With all the other stuff flooding the market these days, it's nice to know there are still good books out there to read.Lauren breaks off her engagement and her brother gives her a computer, so she meets KC online and they kept writing to one another. A die-hard romantic, Lauren finds herself falling in love with KC's letters. And eventually, they meet and fall in love.Yes, it is predictable and sweet ~~ but it's just fun to read. Also, anyone who displays knowledge of the great authors like Barrett and Browning, Dickens and so on ~~ has my heart!This is a great book to read on rainy days. Short and sweet.5-17-04"
5,An Awesome Book,"Echoes is a great book! I would reccomend it to anybody who loves comedy, drama and romance. Keep 'em coming!"
3,a little too predictable,"The internet kinda dates the book, altho I didn't think that took away too much. However, the ending was VERY predicatable. Not my favorite in this series. (but still a nice read)"
3,"A bit predictable, but still a good read","Of course, I find most romance novels to be a bit predictable. This one was a bit dated as the internet is a prominant part of the story, and it has grown and advanced. But it was still a fun story to read."
4,Echoes,"This morning I finished reading Echoes by Robin Jones Gunn, a novel about a woman named Lauren, whose heart is broken and then finds love again on in the internet. Think You've Got Mail kind of story. It's actually modeled after the romance of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, who fall in love through letters.It's a very sweet story, and a quick read, with lots of wisdom and encouragement from the Bible. It's also a part of a series, although you wouldn't feel at all lost even though this is the third book in the series. It's appropriate for teens and adults (with the caveat that teens, & sometimes adults, should not head to the internet for love), and just really enjoyable overall.I received this book for free as part of the Blogging for Books program through WaterBrook Multnomah. All opinions are 100% mine."
5,Curt #13132 Hitch on Chev. S10,"I installed a Curt #13132 Class III hitch onto my S10 short bed pickup. It took a ""leisurly"" 75 minutes for one person working on the driveway - under the rear - with NO lift. The fit was absolutely perfect. Installation was a ""piece of cake"". Completely satisfied."
2,iron in his thighs,"If you grew up in the 60's, the likelihood is that you saw at least one episode of ""The Mighty Hercules,"" a series of short (6-7 minute) cartoons that feature a Hercules who looks like Superman (beardless, with black hair (including the curl), wearing a blue mini-tunic, complete with a war-belt that has a large H on it), is helped by a centaur named Newton (that's right -- couldn't they have come up with a more authentic name than Newton?) in fighting Daedalus (who looks more like Rasputin than he does like the famous Greek scientist). Hercules has great strength (""with the strength of ten ordinary men""), and can leap great distances (more with the Superman analogy). To gain his power, he puts on a ring (with a big H on it) and raises it to the sky -- lightning flashes and he is empowered (what's with the ring -- seems like Green Lantern, or maybe more like Billy Batson yelling Shazamm and turning into Captain Marvel). Still, it's fun to see all this silliness."
2,Painful for arthritic hands,"My hand surgeon had me get a touchpad because ""clicking"" hurts the arthritis in my hands.This doesn't help much. Its responsiveness varies--sometimes it's fine, sometimes it does nothing. Then I have to reach across with my other hand and click the button anyway.I can't select anything with it, either. This is a nightmare.Finally, not a good solution for hand or finger pain, because you have to tap it pretty hard and sometimes repeatedly, for it to respond.I wish a true ergonomics expert would address this need!So, I'm using it for casual things. But if I really have to get something done, my mouse is still plugged in."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH THE MAC AND NO TECH SUPPORT!!!,"Well, I got this trackpad cause it said it would work with the Mac. I have a Macbook 13"" with 10.6.7 running on it that I was unable to get the trackpad to work with. I have a Mac Mini running 10.6.7 and was unable to get the trackpad to work. I have a Windows 7 machine and the trackpad worked great with it, but I did not buy it for the Windows 7 machine, I bought it for the Mac and it is advertised as working with Mac OS X. I figured I must be missing something, so I went to their site to see if there was any FAQs to help me. There were none. I created a ticket with their support and 2 weeks later I still have not gotten a reply, and I even went though my junk mail thinking that maybe they emailed me a solution and my filters sent it to junk mail, but there was nothing. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy!"
5,Bye-bye achy wrist!,"I can keep my carpal tunnel under pretty good control by avoiding things that make it worse.. using a mouse was turning into a dreaded chore. I notice when I use my laptop, it never bothered me, so decided to try this on my desktop. Since I am used to using laptop touchpad, there was no learning curve, and now I am able to work for hours at my computer pain free. I highly recommend this product and setup was a breeze!"
2,Unfinished product,"They should have included a ""base"" for the touchpad, as is you must hold it with one hand to prevent the pad from sliding all over the desk. It could also be better designed, I like to play chess on-line, with a standard mouse you left-click a piece and move it to the desired location attempting to do that with this pad is a feat, even using both hands. I returned the product (although this wont apply to all) because the one I received had something loose inside that made a bothersome rattling noise every time I touched the pad.IMO a good idea, but the product needs to be better designed."
2,Works okay but sure wish there was an enhanced driver,"I am one of those people who hates the ""tap touchpad to select"" feature of touchpads and promptly turns it off whenever I can. I suspect that my rather large hands are responsible for a lot of false positives. Anyway this touchpad doesn't come with an enhanced driver so all I am left with is the default firmware programming of the touchpad, which in this case includes ""tap touchpad to select"". As a result the two units I purchased now sit in a drawer, unused and gathering dust. If you don't like the ""tap touchpad to select"" feature either, pass on this one."
3,Tends to tip,"I like having a touchpad that gives me just the features I need. For those purposes, this product serves me well. The pad is small but of sufficient size to do what I need. My issue is with the design. When I depress a button, the EasyCat tends to tip. I prefer to use the buttons, rather than tapping to click, so the tipping is a problem. It also makes highlighting difficult. I learned to manipulate it so that the tipping doesn't happen very often but I shouldn't have to. I was also disappointed that the USB cable connects at the side rather than at the back. I'm living with the annoyances because I like the simple features, but I can't recommend this product because it's designed so poorly. I did enjoy using another Adesso product previously, however, so I would consider buying an Adesso touchpad with a better functioning design in the future."
4,Just what you think it is,"These things are hard to find! It looks just as the pictures show and works fine. You can double-tap on the touchpad, slide your finger up and down on the right side to go thru pages. The only thing I wish was different about this was that the cord would have been on the top instead of on the right side but this is a minor point. I've been using this for about a month and no complaints."
3,"for some, vertical mouse may still be the answer","This may be more suitable for those that find themselves doing mouse-intensive work throughout the day. After having tried the touchpad, I am going back to my evoluent vertical mouse. reason being that the touchpad required left to right movements that were not as comfortable as the upright mouse. I can't speak to the precise reason only to comfort, ease and less strain."
2,Wobbly as she goes!,"Decent product, but mine was warped and won't sit level. It was a little annoying trying to use it while it wobbled around on its four uneven little rubber feet. I finally put some playdoh-like stuff on the feet to keep it from moving around because when you hit the left or right click button it would lift up the other side. Only used for a few days. Should have returned it."
2,Not so good,"I have been using a trackball of 1 sort or another ever since my 1st computer. After seeing, & reading the details on how this works, I thought this would be a perfect UPGRADE to a trackball! My thinking being this would be MUCH better than a trackball, in ease of use, accuracy, just all around BETTER than a t/b! Very mistaken! This is just to small an area to work on,( or with), it is EXTREMELY sensitive! To much so! And, at the same time,you can do all but hit the thing w/a hammer, & it wont respond! So, if you can understand this, it is much to responsive, & NOT nearly responsive, ( or sensitive) enough at the same time! I am going to try the Browser cat touchpad, just to see if that may fix the problems? I do like the idea of the touch pad, & hope the new 1 will work fine?"
4,Works great with Linux,After reading the reviews on this product I was unsure what type of experience I would have using this product with Linux. I'm running Ubuntu 9.10 and the touch pad worked right out of the box including the right click and scroll areas. From my usage it has been a solid touchpad that does what I wanted it to do.
1,Adesso Easy Cat 2 Button Glidepoint Touchpad,"The order was received quickly and in good order. The only thing is, it doesn't work as advertised. I contacted Adesso for support. Twice I contacted them. It still did not work with their downloadable driver and software. It was supposed to be a plug and play It would not recognize the device. I have returned the device. Amazon is great about returning a product does not perform as advertised. If you purchased the device you may get better results, but then you may not."
2,Bit of a disappointment,"After using laptops for years going back to a mouse was too much when I got a new desktop computer, so I bought one of these but it was a bit of a disappointment. The initial problem was a conflict with the TV Card remote driver which I eventually found a workaround for, the biggest problem is whenever you have sweaty or wet fingers the mouse becomes completely unusable and nothing but a restart will sort it, this happens to me usually half a dozen times a day."
1,SOOOO FRUSTRATING!,It works fine EXCEPT when your hands get sweaty or wet! It is so frustrating it just wigs out. I just want a touch pad as good as a touch pad found on a laptop is that too much to ask? I would even be willing to pay more!
2,Tiny and wobbly,"I got this to replace my many year old version (back when it was a Cirque Cat). Compared to that version the touchpad is about 25% smaller and the whole mouse is about 50% smaller. While I may be able to deal with the smaller touchpad (because it is much more responsive), the smaller physical footprint is driving me insane. It just fits wrong (and my wrist is already getting sore) and it is tippy. The old version had about a 1/2 inch on the frontside of the buttons - in this version the buttons are up to the edge. So when you press them you tip the device forward. Not too much but enough to make you tense up. I really think I am going to have to send it back."
3,Too Small for Prime Time,"This touch pad needs to be twice as large. If you have large fingers, it's a chore to move around the pad. It's fine for what it is, but doesn't work well for me."
1,Not very good,"I bought this after I could no longer use my Power Cat. The Power Cat was terrific. It had a large touch area, it was very responsive but not over responsive. But it did not work with Win7 and they did not update the drivers so I was forced to use it as a simple USB touchpad with no scrolling features. So I picked this up. I work at home and have 3 PC's attached by a 4 port KVM. 2 PC's are Win7 home premium and prof. One is Vista. This does not work well with the Win7 prof. I do not recommend this to be used this way. It is a small touch pad base and you have you fine tune the touch or it feels quick and jerky. I'd return it if I could but I have passed my return window."
4,Read it for the good stuff,"This is an interesting tale of real ranching life on the Mexican/U.S. border in the 1960's. If you are interested in ranching, cowboys, or this part of the country the book will be very interesting. Even if you love cowboy tales like I do, it does bog down a little here and there. Mr. Duncklee draws some profound and useful life lessons from his experiences at the end of the book that I think would be worthwhile for everybody to read and understand. But if horses, cattle, cowboys, vaqueros, and desert don't interest you at all - well, you could probably take a miss on this one, because I doubt you'd read it to the end where the good stuff is. I enjoyed it, I'm pretty sure not everyone would. But you might oughta read it anyhow."
4,"Great scent, poor staying power","I absolutely love this scent. It's soft, floral, feminine, and unique. The one problem is that it isn't long-lasting at all, at least not on my skin. I need to constantly reapply it in order to keep the scent fresh. Another reviewer cautioned that the perfume doesn't smell like the Lollia Breathe hand creme, and I agree...but the perfume scent is much better than the hand creme, in my opinion."
1,Weight of item is wrong!,The weight of the container is stated to be 10 ounces. It's not! The turmeric powder arrived in 8 ounce jars. The last time I ordered this product they were in 14 ounce jars. Same price but a lot less spice.
5,i didn't buy this.specific product but.I.bought the 7 oz organic bag on Amazon too.,"I.bought it for health.benefits. i had a bad cough, those dry ones. I used a tea spoon of this spice into hot.water and drank it. Within 20 minutes, I swear I.started to cough...but.this time it was cough with mucus. I felt better and it started to clear up my cough and the cough was gone within 2 days. No medication taken."
2,disappointing,"I am very disappointed in this product. I expected aromatic, full flavored turmeric. Instead it has a flat, non-distinct, unimpressive, flavorlessness. The dishes I have used this particular turmeric in have had a dull, lifeless quality."
4,today the world trade center fell. Delaney showed how,"In the light of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centertoday, I was immediatley reminded of ""Triton"", and the way thewar was fought in that book. The attack on the gravitygenerators on Triton was similar in many ways to what happenedtoday in New York City. I have not identified the here and nowwith a Sci Fi novel so strongly since Chernople blew up and I wasreminded of Lester Del Rey's ""Nerves""! ..."
1,Can a book be worse than this?,"Maybe I just missed the boat on the whole Delany thing. The guy won back-to-back Nebulas in the late 60s, but everything I've read by him is just bizarre. I read Dhalgren, and that was pretty pornographic, but the book had a real message to it, which almost outweighed the graphic sex. Trouble on Triton though, ugh. They don't come worse than this. First of all, the book is completely lacking in plot. Second of all it has nothing enjoyable about it. To summarize: strange man tries to find love, but ends up hanging out with 74 year old homosexuals who don't wear clothes playing calculus games. I found the stuff that wasn't disgusting to be stupid, and what wasn't stupid was disgusting. Avoid this book at all costs."
3,"Triton is a thought-provoking, yet also irritating, book.","Dating from the mid-70s, Triton still provides much food for thought. As you can also see, the novel can still provoke some homophobic hostility. So a couple of decades on, we're not out of the woods yet - this ain't no heterotopia. Triton's strength is that it manages to turn our preconceptions upside down, especially concerning gender. Its weaknesses, I suppose, lie in the plot and in the character of Bron; yes, he is complex and not two-dimensional, but he is also intensely irritating and thoroughly difficult to identify with. I also found all that communal living claustrophobic in the extreme - if this is the future, it is surely a dystopian one. A mixed reaction, then, but I would recommend reading this novel, if only to confront one's prejudices."
3,Crazy. Fun. Weird.,I read this book for a thesis paper for a class at college. It was in a word: odd. I liked how Delany describes a futuristic society. He definately makes for an interesting reading. I liked how it was all over the place and I couldn't believe what the main character Bron does at the end of the story. I feel sorry for Bron because he doesn't ever find what he is looking for. A good if long read. Not for the faint of heart either. There is cursing and explicit sex throughout. So don't give it to kids. I would reccomend reading it over a long period of time.
3,"Some Informal Remarks Toward the Modular Calculus, Part One","TRITON is the story of Bron Helstrom, an ex-Martian gigolo residing in a male dormontory on Triton. Delany's ""science"" is ludicrous to say the least, but his characterizations and portraits of society breaking apart into tribes of people with similar notions or physical appearances is fascinating. Bron's exposure to some street art shakes him up and by the end of the book Bron is not the same character he was at the beginning. This book is a tough read, but it is worth the effort. If you want accurate depictions of satillite life, see Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey series; if you want to explore the eternal mysteries of sexuality and gender, then read TRITON and join Bron on his quest for finding his place within society."
3,where's the second half ?,This book gives a convincing and well researched thesis that the conventual chronology for the years roughly 1000BC to 500BC have been inflated by about 250 years. It also demonstrates that the problem is with the standard egyptian chronology which is throwning off the dating. This is a thesis put forth in other books notably PHAROAHS AND KINGS by DAVID ROHL however this book goes into greater depth and covers more areas than any other book I have seen on the subject. But frustratingly it stops there and totally fails to give the authors thesis on what the correct chronology for this time is. The impression left is that this only half the book. What's here is very interesting but is like a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces left out.
2,Poor Sizing,"I ordered the extra large size of these, and they were tight! I have rather small hands, but like to wear a liner glove inside. I thought XL would be plenty big, but they were tight even without the liner glove. The velcro closure on the battery pouch didn't seem to work well either. Not recommended."
3,Gets warm as advertised...,"However, the plastic battery holder is made so cheaply it broke with first use requiring rubber band fix tokeep batteries in case. Sizes run a tad bit small."
3,out in the cold,"well the price was great, but out in freezing temps the fingers still gets a little colder than expected, they do make a difference. for the price they are ok."
4,So much better than expected...a page turner,"I picked up this book with great suspicion. After all, sequels to famous literary works, NOT by the original author, don't usually bode well. Imagine someone trying to write a sequel to Lady Chatterley's Lover, or To Kill A Mockingbird.I have egg on my face...this book is really quite worthy a successor to Galsworthy. Not exactly like Galsworthy, but therein lies its charm. I was completely taken by this page-turner and can confidently urge the reader who wants more Forsytes to pick it up, for an enjoyable reading experience. Very much a keeper, for those who wanted more of the saga. And, also, much, much better & in true spirit to the original Galsworthy books than the awful recent television adaptation of the Forsyte Saga."
3,Mia Meets Silicon Valley,"Whatever happened to the gorgeous, bare-bones song structures found on ""Come Out of Your Mine"" and ""The Ewe and the Eye""? Both albums contained Mia's beautiful voice and skeletally intimate arrangements. The formerly sublime, personal intimacy has been replaced by (too much) technology. Unfortunately, the technology, in itself, undermines the greatness of the original versions of these songs. However, Todd (sadly) remains to be one of the most underrated singer/songwriters of our time."
3,Definately original but......,"Digital and Autumn are the highlights of this CD of very original music. Mia's voice is very unique and in most cases it is haunting. In some cases however, it verges on veering out of tune which is disconcerting since she is a classically trained singer. Recommended for those seeking something different from the dredge that is pop music today."
3,If only her lyrics were as lovely as her voice.,"There's something arresting about Mia Doi Todd's voice. With elements of traditional Japanese singing in her graceful, swooping inflections, she sounds like no one else you've heard. But her technical skill, and ""The Golden State""'s fine production, only carry the album so far-- and where the lyrics are concerned, it stumbles badly. With a few exceptions-- ""Like A Knife"" and ""Autumn"" the happiest among them-- Todd packs her songs with morose, heavy-handed PC sermonizing and (weirdly enough) overly precious metaphors for her own sanctified genitalia. What might well be fresh and thought-provoking in the hands of a better lyricist sounds here like the clumsy, rhetoric-drunk scribblings of a first-year Berkeley women's studies major. Todd's voice deserves better material. On those all-too-rare songs where the clouds part and her singing can shine through, ""The Golden State"" feels like turning your face skyward on a sunny day."
3,Gets old fast,"I bought this CD because I was so taken by a few of Mia's songs on it, like Digital and Autumn. This was a good CD on the first listen, but I got tired of it real fast. I enjoyed the CDs for a few plays, but then her voice just starts to sound blah and monotone through all the songs. There seems to be an absence of depth here, in her voice, the lyrics, something...Leona Lip"
2,Way Overdone,"Here I go, the minority again.Of The Golden State, start with the good news -- Mia Doi Todd has a great voice, smoky and silky at once. Some of the arrangements early in the CD, are fresh too, especially 88 Ways. Like a Knife is fine and Autumn, the song that sparked my interest when I heard it on a sampler CD, is simply terrific, a keeper forever, in its understated telling of the end of a season and a love. So impressive is it that I really anticipated hearing the rest of this CD...oops!Because everything else is bad news -- mannered, pretentious and overwritten, delivered as if every song were the Sermon on the Mount, without the slightest light touch or sense of humor. One reviewer compared her to T.S. Eliot, a truly absurd concept.If, however, part of your musical tastes tend toward overemoting Enya and Sarah Brightman...this is the CD for you."
5,Ray Davies at the top of his form!,"No other title but Storyteller could convey the contents of this delightful CD. Ray's lyrical wit is well known, but this CD includes his spoken words which are just as entertaining as his songs. I like this CD because it puts The Kinks' songs into perspective and breaking up the songs with spoken stories feels much more personal than the usual collection of songs."
2,A DRASTIC MESS JUST LIKE HIS X RAY BOOK-CHECK OUT DAVE SOLO!,Do not hammer me with this brief review. I am a KINKS fan since they first hit the radio in the early '60s. I saw them about 15 times. I interviewed Dave a couple of times & saw him live. HE KICKED ... & ROCKED HARDER THAN THE KINKS AT THE TOP OF THEY'RE GAME! Ray's STORYTELLER is a DRASTIC DISSAPPOINTMENT. A mess from the start to end. Just talk to fill the musical gaps which when he plays are EMPTY by himself. Let's get FACE TO FACE. BOTH DAVIES BROS. NEED EACH OTHER. Though Dave rocks hard solo... He still fall's short. Ray is totally lost without Dave and STORYTELLER proves it. GOD SAVE THE KINKS OR BETTER YET... RAY & DAVE!
2,Nice Pictures...otherwise uninspiring,"I have to start out by saying that I prefer to make spreads with added pectin. I don't have the time, or patience for the long simmering times required to make a jam or jelly without commercial pectin, and I don't typically care for the flavor that the long cooking times produce.With that said, all of the recipes in this book call for the long-boil method of producing jams and jellies, so I didn't find this book useful.The pictures are very nice, and the scientific information is accurate. She does list processing times for all of the recipes, my biggest pet peeve with any jam recipe is a last line that says ""put into jars and seal"", but a lot of the recipes call for ingredients that I have no idea where to acquire (crystalized angelica???), and cooking processes that can take days (mushroom catsup).I would skip this book in favor of a more inclusive canning guide, or a few hours spent researching recipes and techniques on the internet."
1,"TERRIBLE PRODUCT, EVEN WORSE CUST SERVICE","DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM SUPERPRICE! Camera resolution was terrible. When I returned it, SUPERPRICE refused to refund me. I sent many emails to them to find out what was going on - they all went unanswered. It wasn't until I threatened legal action, that they gave me a partial refund, claiming a 15% restocking fee. This restocking fee is not mentioned in their refund policy. In addition, they deducted 20% from my refund, so they are not even able to use a calculator properly. This entire experience has soured me on internet commerce."
4,Sherrie Can Sing,I love Sherrie's voice. It is wonderful. I can't believe she didn't sell many CD's. I c her as more than a 1 hit wonder. I think she is great. I would recommend this single 2 any1.
3,Don't know if it works,"I made the mistake of not checking the make of the inverter that i have. this switch only works for Vector inverters, due to the control connector on the inverter itself."
3,"Can't go wrong with 100 free grams. Well you can, but this was fine.","Really not a lot to say here. I think it helps with recovery, but it is hard to tell. From a quality standpoint, it was comparable to other brands."
4,Good,"Not much to say,I guess it works :)It does mix pretty well and you cannot taste it..just need to stir quickly when you put it in something or it will clump up. I try to take some every morning!"
5,Great old movie!!!,"Love to oldies but goodies! Got for my son who is a movie-buff, loves the old comedies! Was great! Thx"
5,"Superb transfers, faithful to the 78s","Opus Kura is a recently introduced independent Japanese CD label devoted to faithful transfers of 78-rpm-era historical recordings. I had just finished the new biography of Bruno Walter (by Ryding and Pechefsky), and my mouth watered to hear these two performances with the pre-Anschluss Vienna Philharmonic, the Mozart in particular, which was a specialty of Walter's to direct from the keyboard. These transfers are ideal, like I would do them myself (if I had the capability to do good side-joins, which is the case here). There is enough shellac ""hiss"" to know that the original sound is not being overfiltered, yet it is not obtrusive to those used to playing 78s, and will likely be easily disregarded by those who are not. The richness of sound obtained from the original discs cannot be disregarded. Exemplary. And the performances are incomparable."
4,The Night Abraham Called to the Stars,"The title poem, refered to as ""clunky"" by the Publishers Weekly reviewer, is also one of the first poems of the many, many that I have read and collected that really spoke to me. It is one that I enjoy reading still today.Perhaps this collection is technically inferior in some ways that more studied men than I might disdain, but it feels like a Hermann Hesse novel to me: I know that it isn't the ""best"" literature, but it is literature that inspires me to feel and contemplate, which makes it a favorite of mine."
2,"A Jack of All Trades, but Masters None","A Mediocre Review Book. Doesn't help much with class exams, and is full of holes for the NBME subject exams. It brings up a lot of frequently tested items, but is missing tons of bridging material. This is not the book for students that are serious about understanding medicine. There is a lot of good information there but I would recommend it only as a quick read before your boards. It is certainly not to be trusted as a single source."
5,CranActin Cranberry Extract,"This product is still a favorite - and the price is right. Used mostly to keep UTI's at bay. So far, so good!"
3,"Bosch FS180ATU 5-3/4"", 20TPI, Fine Tooth, General Purpose, Power Handsaw Blade (5 Pack)",Not too happyMis-stated quantityAmazon website stated the quantity was 5 packVendor sent only 1 and said Amazon was incorrect.Who is right?
5,"great science, great photographs","Not only is this book packed with color photographs, but it is also very well written for younger people with an interest in Egypt. Zahi Hawass is the Director of Excavations at the Giza pyramids and the Valley of the Golden Mummies, so he is an expert in the field, and this book includes a lot of science, including CT-scans of Tut's mummy.It deals with the mystery of Tutankhamun's death, it works as a biography of Tut's life, and it whets your appetite for the science of excavation and preservation.. Top-notch."
3,A Quick Read But Not One of the Better Ones,"This book was recommended to me by Amazon and I had it waiting on my Wish List for a long time. I finally bought it and I was really looking forward to reading it.I read it quite quickly. It is easy to read and interesting enough, but all in all, it's not one of the better books I've read."
1,Poor at best,"This story had loads of potential, with an interesting plot line, the development and coming of age of the young girl, however fell short of being an interesting read. For a plot like this to be effective, the reader must be drawn to the character, establishing a relation between reader and character, however this book sped straight into high drama and spent no time developing this vital connection between reader and character. The writing is overwhelmingly basic, but is perhaps the intent of the author. This book fell short of my expectations, and i would suggest skipping this book."
2,Disappointing,Book could have been good but just didnt really please me. Author has great talent but this book just falls short. I seen the cover and name and it seemed like a book I would love. I felt that there was really no plot and it was kinda hard to follow at times. The author did not use quotation when people spoke making it kinda hard to read. Would not recomend to read. I read around a book a week or more and was disappointed at the ending. It left me hanging and angry that I don't know what happened. The ending was also unrealistic.
2,Hmph.,"I was kind of dissapointed. I read all the reviews and the idea sounded wonderful, but when I started reading it I was a little disappointed. Ever have one of those books in the corner that you start and you keep thinking ""I want to finish it.."" but you never do? That's the authors fault, not yours. I remember one part where Justine first meets her, and she is suddenly asking the main character if she wants to go to a crazy party with her, out of nowhere. Just seems really unrealistic, and when you read it you feel as if your blind to something, like the character is looking at the ground 80 percent of the time, and looks up every once in a while.Sorry, i really wanted to like this book but found that I couldn't."
3,it's ok,"The Torn Skirt is an ok book. I don't think it deserves 4 stars, but it's better then 2 stars. It really is just ok. The story line is good, but a little hard to follow. The book gets slightly confusing at times, and makes you stop and flip a couple pages back to remember what happened. There are several perverted scenes in the book. If you don't like explicit descriptions this book isn't for you.Don't waste your money on this book. It's not worth it. If you really want to read it then check it out from the library."
5,"absolutley amazing, and never boring.","From the first sentence to the last, this book had me sitting on the edge of my seat. If I had the time I would read it over and over again just to make sure i have every detail right. The ending was absolutely AMAZING and i would recomend it to anyone over the age of 13. The book is placed in england, in the 80's, and deals with love, jealousy, prostitution, drugs, stealing, killing, anger, running away, everything. The story line is mostly about a girl, named sara, looking for justine, a young girl with a torn skirt who she has only seen a few times before. While looking for her, she bumps into mental institutions, drugs, love/lust, prostitution, and crime.I honestly think this is my favorite book of all time. And if you are looking for a different type of writing, and now the normal cliche book, i highly suggest this."
2,Doesn't Deliver,"Eh. I'm more than a little disappointed. If you like the ""Go Ask Alice"" type of thing, this is the book for you. I didn't care for that one either. The whole time I was reading ""The Torn Skirt"" I kept thinking to myself, 'is this repetitive melodrama or is it just me?'"
3,good book,"I read this book while laying on the beach in marthas vineyard. It was something that a friend just recommended when she was rambling off good books to read. I was in a hurry at barnes and noble and was quite close the ""G""'s in the fiction section. The book went by fast and kept me out of the water. I rarely read books twice and I've read this twice...."
5,obsessed,my friend sandrine and i are rather obsessed with sara shaw. we're not quite sure why. we saw a girl who looked like her on the bus with red hair and the same kind of reverie. we asked her her name and where she was going and followed her for a while. i guess that doesn't make sense. there is a community for this book on live journal so go there if you get it.
2,I thought it was going to be better....,"I had high expectations for this book and I bought it off amazon.com hoping it was going to be good. I was wrong. At first I thought the book was just off to a slow start and would eventually get better. I read the book in about a week and found hardly any improvement in it's entertainment value. I would have checked it out from the library except there wasn't a copy that wasn't lost. Although there were some decent parts, it wasn't enough to make me think this book was worth the money it costs. If you really want to read this book, buy it used."
3,eh better for a younger audience,"I was probably 17 when I read this book (a few years ago). If you are curious about drugs and sex and street life and mental institutes- then this is a good way to ease you in. Maybe for a pre-teen, but not for the more experienced bad girl.....although I did enjoy the little mental institute part, near the end? something about a padded room? If you were shocked by the movie Girl Interupted...and you didn't really get it...then read this...it's an easy read."
3,reminiscent of...,"An interesting book along the lines of The Catcher in the Rye. A girl in the lead. We follow her around and in the end, no harm falls upon her. A rarity."
1,Not impressed.,"I didn't care for this book, I think it's highly overrated. I think the author has seen too many movies that use flashback scenes, because she tried to use them all over the place in this novel and it just made it more incoherent."
5,Not what you might expect,"The reviews I've seen of this book talk about drugs and wild nights--but believe me, folks, this ain't no ANIMAL HOUSE, nor Bret Easton Ellis neither. Sara Shaw is amazing, completely un-self-aware; you want to wrap her up tight till the storm passes, or shake her (a little) in hopes that maybe, just maybe, she could see about herself what YOU see in her; but you also know she wouldn't allow it.....This here's a literary gem, all the more powerful because it's not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve."
1,I thought this was the actual soundtrack with the songs not the background music,"I didn't know this was the background music, I wanted the CD with the artists singing."
2,Don't bother!,"Did not follow movie soundtrack, only instrumental. Movie soundtrack included lots of audio and vocals of top hits. This did not!"
4,IT'S OK YOU MIGHT KEEP THIS IN MIND FOR YOUR CRISTMAS LIST,"THIS CD IS OK . BUT THEIR IS ONE AWFUL SONG! IT'S BY THE "" ROLLING STONES"" IT SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF CATS HISSING . YUCK! IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE YOU'LL LIKE THIS YOU'LL ALSO LIKE IT IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC . THE BEST SONG ON THERE IS A SONG CALLED "" IN NEED "" BY SHERELL CROW , IT REALLY HITS THE SPOT IF YOU LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY AND A LITTLE BIT OF POP . SO IN MY OPINION GO A HEAD AND BUY IT . I BOUGHT IT FOR MY MOM THIS CRISTMAS SHE LOVED IT . IT'S THE PERFECT GIFT FOR ANYONE AT ANYTIME ."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I thought that this was the actually songs from the movie....not the score. Nice, but not sure who wants to listen to random movie scores."
5,Excellent Study Guide,"All the Delmar ASE test prep books for Automotive/Light Duty exams are excellent! I answered at least 90% of the questions correctly on every exam for which I usedthe Delmar guides. As an automotive instructor, I recommend this guide to all my students who plan to take the ASE Automotive exams, and I use some questions fromthe guides in making my own exams for class. Great study guide!!!"
5,Great CD!,My 9 yr old loves all the songs on this CD. I surprised her with the CD since she seemed to really be into memorizing the lyrics to a lot of these songs! :)
1,Received wrong item,"I rarely write reviews, but I was totally disgusted with this experience. I ordered the black case, but received a clear one. It seems like an easy detail to get correct. I wouldn't recommend ordering this item."
5,Screen Hits the Stars,"This screen does everything we needed it to do. It functions well, the pulldown mechanism works great, it works with our LCD projector. For the price, I'd say it was a bargain."
1,Lion Of St. Mark,"I recently purchased Sandokan Pirate of Malaysia, The Executioner of Venice , and Lion of St Mark. Stay Away From These Titles From Sinister Cinema! First of all the movie prints are of such bad quality you can barely watch them! The colors are faded, and dark, which means the original print must've been pretty bad to begin with . All three of these movies have been reviewed by one reviewer, Paul Scott , who gave 4 out of 5 stars for each movie. After seeing how truly awful these movies are ,one has to wonder how unbiased Mr. Scott's reviews are? Hopefully Amazon will have their movie review staff rereview the brand of movies being offered by Sinister Cinema, and check these movies out with unbiased reviews. The movie copies look like they've been recorded by some cheap home processing as the menus were done from a person using a home dvd recorder . Very tacky!! Buyers Beware!!!! I feel like I've ripped off, and you will too!"
5,Thunder,"North central PA and their characters were a great read. A corporate creator being fought by early greenies, A combination for a moving story."
4,highlight is the ant banks diss,"pooh man dissed ant banks and had beef with too short, and spice 1 not a bad cd brings back memories though."
3,Use with caution and corroboration,"This work is widely available online for download, but no critical reviews seem to exist. In many cases, family lineage is chiefly a list of names with little or no identifying information. Some family lines have more narrative than others. There is a notable lack of documentation to prove the accuracy of numerous family connections indicated in the book. Perhaps there may be some clues for further research regarding some individuals, but it would not be wise to count on the reliability of this source without corroboration from original records or from better documented works. So, don't ignore the clues, but use the book very cautiously."
4,Chong is King!,This is a really interesting documentary that talks about the ridiculous fashion in which Tommy Chong was arrested. This doesn't only show the outrageous circumstances involving his incarceration but also show you how cool and utterly genuine the man Tommy Chong is. I love this guy and everything he's in.Even Evil Bong was fun because of him and I'm looking forward to the new one Evil Bong 2 that's coming out in July. Should be stoner heaven.
3,Tommy Chong,"I wanted to know the story of this ""Bust"" and learn just how hokey the drug war is in America the Beautiful. If you are convinced we have a war to win you will not like this video. It gives a side of Right Wing Crazies that is Dark and Sinister. We should just make it all legal and deal with the problems. We are the largest Prison State ever in the world. If you give everyone a felony record, you can impose you will more easily."
1,dont buy any hot tools products,"I have many curling irons, but I was looking for one made of tourmaline. This got good reviews on here and other websites, but the grip is so loose that it won't give good curls. SUCKS!!!"
1,Missing passage?,"You guys are either more tolerant, less attentive, or luckier than me. My download (both on my Kindle on on my PC reader) has a apparent omission of indeterminate length at location 255: ""...to their different ap- [lacuna] Christian term, referring to.."". Since I do not have a hard copy to compare it to, it is hard to know whether to skip over it or not."
3,Deep and Rich..but..,"but Heim is confusing in spots - pg 291 -""the testimony of the religions is essential for internal Christian life."" Hmmmmm? I am sure Peter tells us that in Christ we have everything we need in order to have a thriving internal Christian life. Does Heim mean that until I study other religions my Christian life won't be all it can be? This is ludicrous."
5,Alice Peacock,"Whether this is her REAL name or not-you have to admit after listening to this CD that her music is ALL REAL!! Alice's strong yet lilting voice seems to surround you with a feeling of comfort and familiarity that you will not find with other performers. It's like having one of your buddies performing in your living room! She is an extraordinary talent, who manages to tell a story, somewhat the way Joni Mitchell did on her earlier albums. Alice shares bits and pieces of her life with you, and manages to do so with a soft, flowing, sweet voice that captures joy, reminisences, and heartache. This is a beautiful collection."
5,1000 STARS!!!,"Someone please tell me why this woman has not won a Grammy? I had never heard of Alice Peacock when I saw this album at HVM. But that little voice in my head told me ""Your going to love it."" And sure enough this CD has not left my cd player in like two years. I love it, love it, love it!!!Can't wait for the new release in June!"
4,"Wedding ""Bliss""","We have chosen the song ""Bliss"" as our wedding song because it is such a captivating and heartfelt song about love."
4,"Opened for ""Heart"" in Saratoga, CA--Great Job!","It's getting only 4 stars because I haven't heard the CD yet, but after hearing Alice Peacock sing last night (August 6) to open ""Heart's"" show in Saratoga, CA, I had to hear more, and based on what I heard there, I can give at least 4 stars to ""Some Things Get Lost, which brought me to tears. I usually take opening acts with a grain of salt, but after just one song, I was hooked. I can't wait to get this CD!Note: I finally got this CD and it's great. Good buy."
1,"NON REFUNDABLE,wILL NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","WILL NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING MORE FROM AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!product was not what I expected and wanted a store credit and it was not available for credit,so IM STUCK WITH IT NOW!!!!tHEY SHOULD TELL THERE CUSTOMERS THIS WHEN YOU ORDER FROM THEM."
5,Montemarano is a rising star to watch,"Having read both ""A Fine Place"" and this latest collection, ""If the Sky Falls,"" I'm convinced that Montemarano is the most important new writer to watch. In the tradition of Joyce Carol Oates, Jayne Anne Phillips, Tim O'Brien, and Don DeLillo, these stories hit a nerve and don't let up. He does what the supposed whiz kids of the moment seem to be afraid of doing, writing what risks most without promising redemption, using measured doses of experimentation that, like O'Brien and Phillips, not only serve the story but are necessary to the story, and writing with heartbreaking honesty, an overused term, but one that is more than applicable here. Nicholas Montemarano is not only the best writer to come on the scene in over a decade, he competes with the greatest of novelists and short story writers. This book more than deserves all the buzz surrounding it."
5,"Great, overlooked collection","I'm surprised that this collection of short stories hasn't gotten more attention. Each story is dark, stressful, compelling, character-driven, and well-written.One of my favorite stories is the stressful (in a good way) ""Notes to a Future Self"" about a brother reluctantly helping his sister who is in an abusive relationship. Montemarano's world is dark, but touching at the same time."
3,YA supernatural thriller/horror,"Book #4 in the Dark Forces Young Adult Horror series.A mysterious cove and a old whistle summon a horror from the past. This book is targeted at the 12-15 age group. Most adults will probably find the story a little simple, but it is good for the targeted age."
4,Not UGK's fifth album,"Bun B has the best delivery and flow in rap. This cd is super tight like their second cd. Bun got skills, and Pimp C spit that pimp game like no other. My favorite tracks are The Corruptor, Dirty,Dirty, Belts To Match, and All About It. The only drawback is that its some songs that Jive Records slapped together on a cd to make a quick buck since UGK moves at least 300,000 units every time it comes out and they were slapped together. All the songs were featured on other artists cds and are hard to find. One of the songs is 6 years old. However, the songs are tight, they just don't fit together as tight as a UGK album that Bun B and Pimp C works on. This is more like a ""Greatest featuring UGK Hits cd."" Their real next album will either be called UGK V or Ridin' Platinum."
5,Breakin Sketti Playa,"This cd is hella tight. I only heard a couple cuts and I'd still buy it just for that. Breakin Sketti has some tight middle eastern beats and some smooth flows. Basically, buy this cd, or if your po folk, download some tracks and find out what down south music really is. Ya heard me?"
5,Sublime,"Think On These Things is a great book. J. Krishnamurti offers his thoughts on a variety of subjects, including:AmbitionAn Open MindCooperation and SharingSelf DisciplineListeningThe Problem of FreedomConformity and RevoltRenewing the MindKnowledge and TraditionThe Function of EducationThe Simplicity of LoveInward Beauty"
4,"Enlightening, but I'd challenge some of it.","I have become very interested in Eastern thought, and this was the perfect find for me. I found Krishnamurti's observations very interesting, but some I'm not sure of. he always talks about the virtue in not being ambitious...yet he has a book published and is recieving royalties for it, isn't he?"
5,question yourselves...,"whatever K says may not matter. but, he has indeed raised a fundamental question ""why have the methods devised by human conciousness have failed to bring permanent solution to problems and sufferings? leaders after leaders have attempted to solve, but created more difference of opinions. Once has to sincerely question that to oneselves."
4,simple and understandable,"Although, as he often noted, some of the questions the students presented were not well put or relevant, in my opinion, I enjoyed this read because it was very simplified and covered important subjects in a brief and friendly manner. It's a good way to start if you wish to know more about Krishnamurti's teachings."
5,Interesting book on Washington's neighborhoods,"I've been studying Washington, DC a lot, but I've learned a lot about the development of the city from this book. For instance, I didn't realize what an important center of factory work the Navy Yard had been, in a city which always had relatively few factory jobs.Each of the neighborhoods are very different, and their colorful histories are well described. The photographs are good, and there are enough maps to keep you oriented.The discussions of race relations and demographics are refreshingly honest.There are good references in the back that will help you dig deeper into a particular neighborhood.It's also interesting to see that some of the realtors and developers who were very central to the covenants (and other shennanigans) that kept blacks and Jews out of many neighborhoods were sponsors of the publication of the book."
2,Not entirely accurate...,"I bought this book because our family is the ""Dean"" of Deanwood. My great grandfather was Julian Willis Deane. He was married twice with 12 or so children from his first wife--who apparently died in childbirth. The authors chose to interview some of the offspring of the second marriage which produced only a few descendants and intimated they were the only ones. Sort of strange! Makes me wonder what else they got wrong..."
2,Lives up to its title,"This is certainly the worst al-bum. ""Fat"" is great, but it goes downhill from there. ""I think I'm a Clone Now,"" and ""Alimony,"" fit the music perfectly but aren't all that funny. The other songs are just bad. Save your money, because this album indeed is even worse."
4,Not your best Al,"This CD as its times but it has its downs to!Fat is great and so is This Song is Just Words Long. I Think I'm a clone now, Lasagna, and Good Old Days are really funny! Stuck in a Closet with Vanna White is kinf of funny but this is not Al's greatest cds!"
5,One of his best albums ever.,"Containing some of his best songs to date, Even Worse is Even better than all other albums. I love it."
1,I was sent a cassette,"The person selling this product sent me a cassette. Grrrr...otherwise, Al is a funny guy with musical talents to get a laugh."
3,"Some Great Songs, But Also Some Bad Ones","This album is just like Polka Party. Some songs are great, but some are unbearable. Fat is a classic song. Lasagna is a nice tune also. Other likeable songs are Stuck In A Closet With Vanna White, I think I'm A Clone Now and Alimony."
5,Most funny songs I've ever listened to,"The best songs in this CD are: Alimony, I think I'm a Clone, You Make Me, This song is (just six-words long) and Twister. All these songs are very funny. The rest of them are just okay."
1,Are you kidding me?,"This video is an absolute waste of time. Amateur video, only 18 minutes long! Techniques not worth watching. Save your money!"
3,Neutral,"I'm only neutral because I gave this as a gift to my nephew. He loves the nunchucks and has used them often, but I don't know if he has tried the video yet."
4,I confess: I'm a cherry-coke-aholic,"Yes, I know that Coca Cola already makes a cherry product, but it's not cherry enough for me so I augment the cherry cokes I buy (2-liters) with a splash of this cherry syrup. It is great tasting, but the manufacturer has a problem with spillage. It is unusual to find a bottle that doesn't have some sticky residue on it (as if from an extra drip or two when filled). So, it's a really tasty syrup, but be prepared to wipe down every bottle to remove the stickiness."
4,Cherry Syrup,"We enjoy this product for using when we make Manhattans. The only thing I was disappointed with was that when we opened up the packing box there were 2 bottles that had been leaking, and I had quite a sticky mess."
4,Garden protector,"The Zareba A5 electric fencer is strong enough to scare off ground hogs and rabbits who are determine to eat up my garden plants, but not so strong as to harm them permanently. It took a few design changes in how to space the wire so it covered the different animals trying to get in. Once the wire was properly positioned nothing has bothered my garden. If you want to raise a garden and need help keeping predators out, this product is well worth installing."
3,"Don't use with the ""Q""","I use this headset with our new VoIP phone system and I love it. But, it wont stay connected to my Motorola Q for more than 20 seconds. I dont know why, but the whole idea was to have one headset that could work on both units."
3,Good for close range,this product does great when you are in close range of it. Don't walk off to far though. One good thing is that you can use it with more that one phone.
1,DIAL TONE PLEASE !,"I was unable to get a dial tone on the first one. The GN Technician I spoke with to resolve the problem said the unit was defective. E-mailed Amazon and they shipped another immediately, no charge. However, I had the same issue with the second one. I am now in the process of shipping it back to Amazon for a full refund."
4,Critique of US Foreign Policy,"While it is many years since I read the Novel, the work appeared a thinly disguised critique of American Foreign Policy toward the Middle East and the Islamic World as it was in the 1970s.Especially the bit about a sunday school teacher named James Earl Carter being responsible for cutting off the CIA funding which was directed to funding various charitable works in Iran, effectively destabilizing Society and resulting in the overthrow of the Shah.Fiction, smiction; that was just a front to get published without getting sued or banned! Well worth a read!"
5,Replaced original step.,Purchased a set of two as refurbished. Looks like a new one; only needed one so now we have a spare in the event another breaks (used for 7 years so it may be awhile before we need the spare but I have it.) Price was $16 less than a new one if purchased locally.
4,good product a little hard to install,"These are nice product for anyone needing a boost to help get up in their truck. Be prepared to spend the better part of half a day installling them. Instructions are unclear and often require modification, but when finshed they look nice seem very sturdy."
5,Side Step,Arrived as scheduled. Item was as described and it was easy to install. I would recommend this item to others.
5,2007 f150 super crew,"Great steps looks great very sturdy. Install Instruction could be better. But after figuring it out went on easy. You'll need a good drill. A compact one would be best a 1/8"" drill bit a 3/16"" drill bit and a 3/8"" drill bit a maker and a square Phillips head. Awesome product."
4,One of Fieldings better books since See Jane Run,"I couldn't put this book down. I thought it was exciting and that Fielding gave a good portrayal of a psychopath, Brad Fisher, and his victim Jamie. It reminded me of the character Colin Friendly in a previous book of hers. The only criticism I have is the ending was a bit abrupt, though it had a nice twist."
3,Mad River Road,"A suspenseful novel with a surprise ending,but not as well written as some of Fieldings novels. I still couldn't put it down. A real page turner."
4,Terrific Story...Abrupt Ending!,"I enjoy Fielding's writing. I have read a few of her other pieces and find her to keep the story moving at a very fast pace as she presents the reader with several twists and turns. This work was no different. After having read her ""Whispers and Lies"" (which has one of the best endings of modern day fiction) I turned the pages of this novel faster than the Pope passes out holy cards, and I was rather disappointed as I got to the climax because it was so abrupt (however, not bad), it left me with a sense of wanting more and asking myself...Is this it? That's OK Joy, you kept me going and I enjoyed the ride. I will look forward to reading another one of her novels in the near future."
4,Very Entertaining,"I really loved this book. I can normally tell you what happens in the end by the 2nd chapter, but this one really threw me a curvball. I was happy with the ending and with the other characters viewpoints throughout the book. A little dark, but very hard to put down."
3,Not her best,"I love Joy Fielding and although this book was a quick read, it was not exactly a thriller. Interesting enough, the characters are not all that likeable with the exception of Beth, and the abrupt ending is a real disappointment. More of a drama than a suspense novel, and if not for the ending I would have rated it higher. Her novel ""See Jane Run"" Is a thriller."
1,Not worth it!,"This was a first book of J. Fielding I read. A friend is trying to convince me to give a try to another one of her books. I did not have to get too far in the book to pretty much put together what's going to happen. The main character could not be more stupid, is that how Fielding views women? Fielding used characters that had absolutely nothing to do with, or contribute to the main story. The way I see it she needed to have more pages for the book, so she wrote, frankly, useless conversations to give it bulk. The book is very shallow, not a good fiction and not even ""true"" to real life, not a thriller. It leaves you empty."
4,Interesting,"This is a good read, though I didn't really enjoy it as much as I did ""Puppet"" by the same author. Fielding keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what the villain is going to do next; in fact, he's the most interesting character in the novel, overshadowing all of the female characters, something that was a bit -- but not much -- of a drawback for me. The book is well-plotted, though it's not too hard to figure out the ending if you really think about it, knowing this author's penchant for not doing the obvious. While there is some romance in this book, it is primarily a novel of suspense, and this is done very well."
2,Book Format,"The size of the book is VERY annoying. Because it's 4"" x 7.5"" it's difficult to read. Based on this, I wouldn't purchase another book written in this format. The lines are very short.Give me a paperback written in the old format."
5,Take a breath when you're done reading the last page,Lilly Rodgers and Emma Frost are single mothers and neighbors on Mad River Road. Both live in fear that their secrets will be discovered one day. The prologue captures the reader's attention and does not let go. Jamie Kellogg hits a low point in her life when she discovers a secret about her lover. She hates her job and decides to leave Florida with her new and exciting lover Brad Fisher. Jamie has never meant anyone like Brad. As Jamie slowly questions and discovers the details of his life he has told her are false; his behavior becomes more erratic. All three stories are on a collision course as Brad and Jamie reach Ohio. Not to the very end will you know all the answers. Mad River Road is a thrilling work of fiction!
4,Better than anything Fielding's done of late,"I really enjoyed this book. I have read just about every book Fielding has written and she used to be one of my favorite writers. Her early novels were the suspense equivilant to Olivia Goldsmith's more chick-litty variety of ""girls getting back and the men who did them wrong"" However, Fielding lost me with the two most recent books Grand Avenue and The First Time, I couldn't seem to get into either of those. Mad River Road was a refreshing step back to the books of her early years, though the formula she used back then is absent, I think thats a good thing. The worst thing an author can do is become formulaic. Mad River Road sucked me right in and I had trouble putting it down. I recommend it to those of you who like that edge your seat variety of writing."
3,"Good thriller, but not a road for every mystery reader!","This book was well-written, and it is a definite page-turner. Joy Fielding really took you into the life of the main character, so much in fact that at the end of the book I felt a little letdown. I was a little disappointed at the ending and some of the events leading to it that were so abrupt. There were several exciting turns that could have taken place that didn't, and a few situations that I prefer not have happened they were so graphic and uncomfortable.I wouldn't recommend this book to people who want their suspense fiction to be a relaxing escape. I didn't feel better after reading this, or a sense of relief. It left a depressing aftertaste in my mind!"
4,Engaging Thriller,"I enjoyed this book as much or more than Joy Fielding's other books, all of which I have read. Very hard to put down and a great diversion. One bonus of the story was the wealth of factoids shared about various points on I-75 but I have to wonder about the mini-tutorial delivered on Davy Crockett/Daniel Boone/Fess Parker dropped into one of the most tense moments of the story. Maybe this is a pet fascination of Ms. Fielding! I have deducted one point on behalf of the citizens of the great town of MiddleTOWN, Ohio, (not Middleton), just outside of Dayton."
5,Finally Found It!,"I have always loved the flavor of malt in shakes. However, I found most shakes were too sweet. I wanted to add just the malt flavor without the sugar or sweetening agent. This is it! I finally found the malt flavor I have been looking for without all the added ingredients. This pure malt powder is more likely to form lumps than a malted milk powder so a mixer or blender should be used. If you're looking for just malt flavor , this is the one for you."
5,baking aide,"I'm learning to make sour dough bread, and the barley malt really helps in making the bread raise."
4,An album that never got the credit it deserved!,"The only problem with this album is that it is an EP. There are just not enough songs! On the brighter side, every song on this EP is a winner. There are truly no bad songs on this album. With a diverse background, you can see a lot of influnces coming through in the songs, while maintaining a uniqueness that is refreshing. Along with meaningful lyrics, certain times a glimpse of humor shows through also. Case in paint...there is a part of the album in which a mans voice comes on and says: ""the dog you are about to hear should come from the left loud speaker"" and then the dog barks out of the right. A great album!"
3,Percy Have Mercy,"As others have mentioned the album is a soundtrack to a movie. A few of the songs are short and concise instrumentals, written to fit into the movie. Highlights include God's Children, The Way Love Used to Be, Animals in the Zoo, Willesden Green. God's Children is arguably one of Ray's best songs. John Dalton in Willesden Green does his best to hide his British accent. Animals in the Zoo is a good time with lyrics like; So we're all animals too/ But you're locked up in a zoo/ And you look at me and I look at you. Classic. Whip Lady sounds like it could have been taken off of Radiohead's OK Computer. I really like this album. It's very different and interesting piece of work. I'm glad I bought it."
1,Waste of Time & Money,Don't expect any Divine Revelations from this 3-CD Collection. The Author presents a few generic sales techniques that might be of interest to someone with absolutely no basic selling skills.
4,Excellant value and content.,I have been in Sales for 20 years. We never stop learning in order to stay ahead. The program content is outstanding especially for newer Salespeople. There are also many strong takeaways even for experienced pro's. The investment is a bargain considering you are receiving three audio CD's. I highly recommend adding this to your Sales Library.
2,Not quite what I expected !!,Great price for this audio collection but i think the delivery did not quite do it for me. You also get the feeling you have heard it all before. Also the material does not sound original enough even though mr hopkins is an accomplished salesperson.
3,Some good basic sales techniques - nothing exceptional,"His intonation is the epitome of a smucky sales person. He has some good suggestions, but getting past his delivery requires work.I'd recommend this to someone starting out in sales because he offers a few good examples of various openings and some solid closing advice. If you are looking for a motivational speak who teaches selling I think you'll be let down."
4,Master of Sales - constantly makes me smile too,Tom has been a round a very long time and has help[ed train some of the best. 3 disks on this deal as well.
3,Treo 650 Acc.,Works. It gives me headache. It was not the thing I though it was. Doesn't have enough volume.
2,Treo Bluetooth Headset Review,"The purchase and shipping of the Treo Bluetooth Headset went very smoothly. Very pleased.However, the headset itself has not performed well. I get complaints from the people on the other end of the line including echos, static, low volume, and unclear conversations. Also, I have had to reconnect the phone and headset a number of times. These aren't constant, but are often."
3,Expected better from Palm,Many of the operating functions I have found standard in other phones and headsets either are difficult or do not exist on the Palm 650 / Palm 3206WW Bluetooth Headset combination. The headset randomly does not work and has to be turned off to reset. It does not fit the ear securely and falls off easily. I would consider another option when I buy again.
2,My husband really didn't like it.....,"I got it as a present for his new cellphone, as it was wireless and tought he could use it, but My husband really didn't like it..... Too big, reception problems and the one button does it all turned out to be a problem. I had to return it."
2,Too many problems - will probably return it,"I have had this headset for 5 days now and have the following problems:1. The position on my ear is awkward. It flops around and will actually fly off my ear if I turn my head too quickly.2. The speaker does not line up in front of my eardrum unless I rotate the unit with the mic facing almost upward.3. Volume is marginal - OK for quiet locations but not for stores, airports, etc.4. People on the other end report a slight echo. As soon as I deactivate the headset, the echo goes away.5. I hear a clicking whenever I use it, no matter how close the piece is to my 650.On the positive side, it uses the same charger as the phone. Ummmm... that's about it.I really don't want to return this (what a pain!), but I probably will. Just too many problems. I don't understand why some of these problems are reported by some users and not others... maybe because it has something to do with the underlying service? I have a Cingular Treo 650."
5,Treo Headset,"Before buying this headset, I tried 3 Motorola headsets and neither of them worked very well with my 650. The functionality wasn't there. Now all the functins and features are there and it works great!! Should have bought this the first time around. I would have saved myself a lot of frustration."
1,Good features; poor signal quality.,"I received the headset on Thursday and returned it to Amazon on Friday. The features it offers such as being able to mute the call or switch to another incoming call and put the first caller on hold are convenient, but the signal quality is terrible. The only time there wasn't any interference was when I held my Treo 650 two inches from the headset, so I might as well have just used the Treo without the headset.I tried calling several people, and they all stated that I was breaking up. I also missed out on parts of their conversations because of the interference. I have a Motorola HS820, which I changed out with the Treo headset on the same call to test the signal quality. The HS820's signal was much better, it just wasn't as loud as the Treo headset, which is why I bought the Treo headset. I ended up finishing the conversations on the phone itself."
5,Awesome!,We have this item for months now and this is wonderful.We accidentally put it into washer and dryer...We thought it would not make it for sure. You know what it works wonderfully! It is clear and problem free!! We highly recommend this product! Busy Dad & Mom.
3,Finally a Treo Bluetooth Headset,"Finally I found a Treo Bluetooth Headset. I can charge it using the same charger of my Treo Smart phone. It is ok for me, good sound and quality."
1,no Connection,I can't tell if this product is any good or not because it keeps losing its Bluetooth connection to the Treo and I keep having to reset it.
1,Device did not work and was returned,This device did not work at all and was returned. I didn't bother to exchange. Maybe just a lemon.
2,did not satisfy,"The blutooth that I purchased has a few problems.1st. It does not fit securely inside the ear.2nd. The volume does not get high enough to hear well.3rd. There are not enough adjustments to fit it properly to the ear.4th. It is suppose to be more compatible to the tro 650,but it seems that other Blue Tooths would work just fine with the treo 650 if not better."
3,Good but not Great!,"This was the first of many bluetooth headsets I have tried for my Treo 650, this one had the best sound quality. No one had problems hearing me clearly. The only drawback was that I have problems keeping it in my ear. I tried to be creative,and put a Jabra jel earpiece from a previous headset over the earpiece, and this temporarily solved the problem, but the jel piece kept falling off. If they had something similar to this design, the headset would be perfect. Other headsets I have tried have been been horrible in sound quality. There is a Samsung model I tried that looks very similar to this one, and the quality is very good, but just like this model, it will not stay put in the ear. I hope they fix this problem soon."
2,If only there was a better option...,"I was excited about this product until I put it into everyday use. I don't know if the problem lies with the phone or the earpiece, but the bluetooth connection needs to be reprogrammed on a regular basis. When in use, people often complain about the call sounding far away or hard to hear, which usually clears as soon as the earpiece is removed. I love the features on it (redial being my favorite), but forget about walking too far from the phone - a few feet are all you get."
3,TREO HANDSFREE,"Esperaba que por ser un producto PALM fuera 100% compatible con mi TREO650 y que no tuviera problemas de recepcion... varias veces me dicen que se escucha cortada la comunicacion, igual que el PLANTRONIC que tenia anteriormente.Ademas que el diseño de cucaracha en el oido no es muy lindo..."
1,"Terrible, not woth it, (and I got it free)","This headset came free with my Treo 700 when ordered straight from Palm. While the phone has been fine the headset has to go. I'm currently shopping for a new one. The sound quality is poor. Calls are intermittently dropped, and it just doesn't fit well."
4,I was told this was the best for Palm,I was told this was the best for Palm and others did not work well. I bought it years ago and it did work. Like all these bluetooth ear pieces I had to charge it all the time. Now I just use a wired ear piece I do not have to charge.
5,Great Gag Gift!,Bought this for a gag birthday present for someone who needs a good laugh ;) Thanks for having this available to buy!!
4,Jamal is very pleased with the tape,Jamal was very happy to get the Rugrats VHShristmas. And I will shop with you again.
3,a few major flaws,"I bought this for my Alto sax, which I play in my school band. When I got my saxophone, it did not come with a cleaning kit, but it did come with instructions on how to clean it. Personally, I do not think it matters, but the cloths where not neatly cut. The cloth used to clean the inside broke a few times, but It was easy to fix. The way that cleaner was made was very strange. It was a large piece of cloth with a string through it. on the other end of the string was a round piece of foam and a green bead, like the kind used to make a bracelet. Also, the tone hole cleaner would not fit into my tone hole! I was lucky to have instructions of my own, because this did not come with any! I am not even sure what some of the items are for! Although this does keep my saxophone maintained and looking shiny and new at all times, it is not exactly a kit full of advanced cleaning materials.. This is just for a basic, routine clean."
3,takes a LOT to make beverage sweet,"maybe it's just me, but I found myself adding tons of this stuff to even get a remotely sweet taste- maybe that's what succant is supposed to be like - I don't know. I think next time I will go for coconut palm sugar, ive heard good things about that."
4,Great condition CD,"My Diamond Dogs CD arrived early. The liner sleeve and CD are in excellent condition. This is not my favorite Bowie release from the early 70s. However, the title song and ""Rebel Rebel"" are great songs. They are worth the low price I paid for the ""Like New"" CD. On the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, Beck does a superior cover of the Diamond Dogs title song. There is also a song called ""Nature Boy"" done by Bowie himself on this soundtrack. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars and Aladdin Sane are far better CDs than Diamond Dogs. Overall, it was a good buy to put into my collection."
2,Will not fit standard lawn chairs,"This cover may fit a beach chair, but definately will not cover standard lawn chairs, it's at least 6"" too short. Product dimentions on the description would have been helpful."
5,An excellent collection!,"Mexico native Carlos Santana gives his fans his best recording just like any other artist on any essential/ultimate compilation. Carlos' career began in or around 1969 or '70,one of his first Top 20 hits being EVIL WAYS. Other memorable tunes include WINNING from his 1981 album ZEBOP!. When I first heard the tune,I thought it was Journey frontman Steve Perry singing(Journey are Carlos' Columbia Records labelmates). I found out one of Carlos' bandmates is a vocal clone of Perry. I also heard the Perry clone on HOLD ON from 1982's SHANGO. Another great tune is STORMY,a cover of the Classic IV's 1968 hit. The other songs are great."
1,BAD EDIT,"The Essential SANTANAThis album is a really really bad edit.The songs cut into each other.Tracks from the albums these songs were taken from start a few barsbefore the song which is supose to be playing starts.I like carlos work very much, but the producers of this album really suckbig time.I am thinking about re-editing this album and burning it for myself.It drives me nuts.That is why I could not recomend this album.Buy the individual songs and put it together yourself.Don't wast your money on album unless you plan on doing your own edit to fix it up.ULTIMATE SANTANA on the other hand is a very good edit.But it does not contain all the tracks found on Essential."
2,Santana: Most Over-rated Guitarist Still Living,"Have they convinced you Carlos Santana is a great guitarist for making a career out of recording other people's songs? While great guitarists like Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix pushed the boundries of electric guitar rock as composers, Santana quickly settled into a nostalgia act with a latin beat in tow. In fact, Santana's percussion section defines his ""sound"" as much as his bloated over-saturated tone. Turn of the distortion peddle and let's see what you can really play, Carlos.But for some reason, Santana was recently hand picked as an artist worthy of more recognition by record reviewers and industry insiders - hence this hits collection coat tailing behind the horrible Sham-an.Thinking back, Santana's most memorable musical moment I remember was seeing him live, tilting his head back and holding one note as his percussion men pounded away - and that was supposed to a show of prowess. Sometimes the shadow is way taller than the man."
1,santana sucks,tabla's to annoying cheesy crappy solo's for 40 mins.....no thanks. This is the elevator music from hell.
4,CD matches title,"""Essential Santana"" is just that. It is his heart and spirit in the music. Great music and his voice in rhythm with it. If you like other Santana music, you will like this one as well."
4,A must-have for the Classic Rock fan!,"Owner of an extensive Classic Rock collection, mostly ""Best of"" compilations, I found this to be hugely worthwhile! There's about 10 (out of 35?) songs that prove to be as good as anything else I have. (Almost all the rest are forgettable.) 5-star songs I've never heard on the radio. I couldn't be happier with it!"
3,"Good for hardcore fans, not necessary for anyone else","To he who thinks the list is of only disc 1: that is all 3 discs.Live disc:1. ""Give It Away"" (in-progress) - 3:432. ""Nobody Weird Like Me"" (live) - 5:033. ""Suck My Kiss"" (live) - 3:454. ""I Could Have Lied"" (live) - 4:33Rare disc:1. ""Soul To Squeeze"" - 4:502. ""Fela's Cock"" - 5:103.

""If You Have To Ask"" (Scott & Garth Mix) - 7:125. ""If You Have To Ask"" (The Friday Night Fever Blister Mix) - 6:34worthwhile if you need it, unnecessary if you only think you want it."
4,the rare disc worth the price of the set,"I didn't want to invest in this set based on theprevious reviews. But I finally gave in because sometimesyou need more chilis. I don't care for the remix of Give it Away.A song this good shouldn't be messed with. The live portion justisn't as good as Hyde Park or Off the Map - I guess I'm spoiled. Butthe rare disc - even tho its only 4 songs they justify the cost. Itis the peppers between 'Mother's Milk' and BSSM. 'Sikamikanico' is arocking, 'everything-you-like-about-the-peppers'. Everyone is at theirbest."
3,Too expensive,Amazon didn't make a mistake those are all of the songs on all three discs. $63 is a little more than I'm willing to pay for 13 songs.
5,"Die hard ""CHILLIS"" fan","Ah, yes, you definitely seem like a die hard ""CHILLIS"" fan. So big a fan, in fact, that you can even spell ""chili"" right. So die hard that you must use all capital letters when speaking their name. What a fantastic commentary, nice work."
5,Turn of 20th Century New Mexico Ore Deposits,A very good summary and overview of the ore deposits of New Mexico at the turn of the 20th century.Outstanding work by one of great geologists of ore deposits. An excellent starting point for anyonewanting to know more about the economic geology of New Mexico.
3,Everything Mafia Book; not quite everything,"This book is an excellent peripheral examination of organized crime from its beginnings to its current state.For beginiers, this book will teach lessons and stories about the tentacles of organized crime and explain the overall themes and issues.For mafia experts, this book is nothing more than a regurgitation of issues and theories lacking the supporting facts and details of heavy investigation."
4,Mistaken Idenity,"The book was a quick and easy read. The language used though vivid was not vulgar. The story seemed to bounce around quite a bit, however, held my interest. For the cost, I can't complain."
3,Just ok,The plot of this book was not so good. I mean it was not likely these things would happen. The love scenes were very hot and steamy but all else was a flop.
1,I will not finish!!,"I really don't know where to start. This book was sooooo unbelievable and dumb til it's not even funny. How could someone put something like this together?? I really cannot take the book seriously--it is that bad. I have reached 46% on my kindle and I keep telling myself, I'm going to finish regardless, but I just can't do it. Glad it was only .99, but my time was wasted reading what I did. I am new to this author and I don't think I will be purchasing any other titles in the future."
1,Are you serious? lol,"For what I paid for this book it was worth it. The sex scenes were hot. But seriously the whole time I was reading it I was thinking, ""Can this book get any more unrealistic?"" The only reason I finished it was because I needed to know if I could really categorize this as one of the worst books I have ever read. I can."
4,wowzers,All I can say is that they took playin the Twin switchin tricks to another level. And I couldn't believe how it ended. lol
2,OMG...This Book Was Too Far Fetched!!,"Mistaken Identity was just stupid! I'm glad it was .99 cent, but trust me, find another book to spend your money on. The story was so far fetched and trite that I don't know where to begin.Overall rating: 1.5"
5,OMG!!!!!,"Oh My Goodness!!!! Words escape me at this point. This was an amazingly well written story. What an imagination. Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. With all of the twists and turns, I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. KUDOS to Ms. Hubbard!!!! I will definitely be reading her other books."
1,WOW! You would not believe.......,"This book had me rolling. All the twists and turns the backstabbing and double take. This book was a joy to read. When I finish reading the book. I reread the book. I did not want to put it down. The book is about two set of twins who trade identity and their reaction to their misdeed. The plot had you guess at each turn. The whole time you are reading the book. You are saying ""no way!"" ""they did that!"" ""OMG these people are crazy!"" I love it. The sex scene was off the chains. The book was wonderful!"
2,Disappointing,"The author is very well respected and knowledgeable. However, the book is not clearly written, not well organized, and there is insufficient emphasis on modern concepts of cardiac function coupled with too much detail on molecular pathways that need to be placed in another monograph."
4,A Perfect Cup of Coffee,"Great buy for the money! It makes a fresh, hot cup of coffee (from adding grounds to drinking coffee) in less than 10 minutes. Also comes with a reusable filter and a great travel mug. (If only it would auto shut-off.) If you can live without auto shut-off, it's an excellent buy."
2,Great coffee maker,"Makes good coffee but the cup with lid inserted, it traps fluid as you drink which dribbles down your nice clean shirt."
1,Not worth it at any price. BAD!,"I'm not sure how anyone could have given this piece of junk anything other than a negative review, and here's why: 1) No automatic shut-off. The on/off button is tiny and out of sight; if you forget it on and try to clean or remove the basket, you get steam popped in the face. 2) The tinny basket got stained on the first cup and got worse since. 3) The water NEVER gets hot; luke warm coffee aint fun. 4) I know it's not expensive, but the parts are as cheaply made as you can get; terrible stuff. It's just not worth sending it back, even if I could. Frankly, this item, because of the on/off switch and steam-up, should be removed from the market. I almost never write reviews but this item deserves to be panned."
1,Defective...,"I used this one time and the next day when I attempted to use it again, it would not work! It must have been some type of short within the plug because it wouldn't turn on. I tried 4 different outlets to no avail. So, now I have to go through the hassle of boxing it back up and sending it back for a refund. Amazon is being great about the refund, but buyer beware on this..."
5,A magical performance,"This is an absolutely gorgeous recording by a great artist who preferred the recording studio and stopped performing publicly at 30. His technical ability is at the highest level, but rather than rendering his interpretations mechanical, they are dramatic."
5,1/8th inch blade,This blade was shipped promptly and was very well wrapped. These thin blades are getting pretty hard to find anymore.
4,Duran Duran's NIght Versions,"This is a rare and out of print copy of the remixes of duran duran songs that i picked up in 1998-99. I am a duran duran fan and i saw it in the music store , there were only 2 copys left and i picked it up because it looked unique. Well it definetly is a good find- it contains remixes of union of the snake, hungry like the wolf, rio, planet earth and many more. It also comes with a 2nd enhanced disk of the song new moon on monday (extended mix). The packaging is cool , it has a picture of the band on the front and inside a booklet with a story about duran duran and how they began and also contains pictures of the band. Very good find. I prefer thier regular songs better than the remixes but still worth the money and rare. Recomended."
3,Generally sparse remixes that don't compare to the originals,"Many Duran aficianados may already have these tracks on vinyl, but it's great to finally have them preserved on CD. Some of the earlier ""night versions"" (like Planet Earth and My Own Way) remind us of how close Duran Duran missed the disco era. Whew! Others spend way too much time messing around with pretty stale programmed rhythms, with little clear direction (Union of the Snake, for instance).None of these tracks, with the exception of Hungry Like the Wolf, compare with the wonderfully balanced production of the originals. The basic problem is that Duran Duran --while always paying strong tribute to the dance music genre-- never really made songs that one could actually DANCE to (until they began to incorporate the structure of house and techno later on).Really, ""Night Versions"" serves as a wonderful collectors item, for the liner notes (written by Nick Rhodes) if nothing else. Let's hope they release a b-sides collection soon."
3,For animal lovers,"If big, dark seal eyes make you go gooey, you'll probably enjoy this TV movie about and for animal lovers. The story is predictable, but not poorly executed. During the depression, the orphaned Rowena goes to stay with her maiden Aunt, Miriam, who lives in the back of beyond and avoids human company. Rowena and Miriam adopt a seal, and befriend a scientist, Bernard, who is studying the local geese. The three of them confront poachers and champion wildlife preservation. The seal wins friends by being adorable and charming, and through displaying a penchant to beat a tambourine in time to music. Over time, Rowena and Bernard convince Miriam to be less reclusive, and Rowena grows up (no! Astonish me!). The acting is just okay (although I love Jane Lapotaire, generally speaking). The scenery is quite pretty."
2,"Small, Flimsy",The sign was smaller than I thought it would be and its very flimsy plastic. Would not purchase again thats for sure...
4,Cowboy fan,My husband loved this sign he go for Christmas. It is hard to find Cowboy gear in Philadelphia Eagles territory.
3,I like the size,"The size is great! But I was under the impression that this was s metal sign. It's definitely not. It's s very flimsy cardboard sign. It still looks great, but if you don't take care of it, it'll definitely get ruined ."
4,GO COWBOYS!,"Ok, So I just ordered and Recived Stop sign VERY VERY FAST, Awsome Seller NO Complaints at all,, People on here Were complaining that its not metal, And YEAH SO WHAT!?! It's Still Awesome and Shows Who you like.. THANKS AGAIN For being an AWESOME Seller!"
1,Disappointed to say the least!,"I just received this gift I bought for my nephew, two days before Christmas. The 'Cowboys' sign is all scratched and looks secondhand. It would be ok if I ordered a used product. The edges look like crap, as if someone cut the sign in their garage. Considering there is an official nfl logo on the back, I would expect something to look fresh out of the package. I hope my nephew doesn't think I bought this at a garage sale. Last time I buy from this seller...."
2,Product as described but damaged on arrival,"The sign came just as described, but was scratched up terribly when I recieved it. Since it's was for a gift it is useless."
3,Gift,"This was a gift for the wife she's a Dallas Cowboy fan, and I'm an ATLanta Falcon fan plus!!! I'm deep into the sports world as a fan, so I figure with buying all my teams items I would buy her a few items... I recommend it to sports fans... It is a nice gift to have, go FALCONS!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is a joke. If you can call it a book--it looks like an 8th grader's book report project. There is no cover. It's stapled together pages. I could have written this. Actually, I could have written something better than this. If I were given this free, I would throw it away. The 101 sample toasts are contrived and would, in my opinion, sound so coming out of your mouth at your friend's wedding. I was hoping to find some valuable, useful information and words I could put into my toast by buying this book. Not only did I not find these things, but I would be embarrased to say most of these things he writes. Speak from your heart about your friend and his new wife, you'll be much better off. If I could return this ""book"" for my money back, I would do so in a heartbeat.Mark Cosby"
1,Waste of your cash,"If you're the best man, and you use one of these 5 word toasts at the reception, be ashamed of yourself. I was hoping for samples to help outline the speech I'm going to give, and this book sucks. To call it a book is a joke, it is 4 sheets of paper stapled together. Don't waste your money. The best man's handbook was much more helpful."
1,I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING,"This book, ahem, pamphlet, is nothing more than a bunch of one-liners on twelve loose-leave pages stapeled together. A best man's toast should be at least one to five minutes long. I could have done better doing a search on the internet for free. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,Don't get taken!!,"WARNING! This is a rip-off; it is not a ""book."" It is 4 xeroxed pages stapled together and the sample toasts vary from five words to fifteen and are generally no more sophisticated than this one taken from its ""pages"": ""to the bride and groom, congratulations!"" Yes, it really is that bad."
1,Do NOT Buy This,"A total abomination. Two years ago, in a last minute panic, I purchased this book and quickly scorned myself for being such a sucker and throwing away my money. I just found this ""book"" in a drawer and am still so pissed about what a piece of garbage it is, I felt compelled to warn others. That said, after this review is posted, I will shred this item into as many pieces as possible, and use the remains to build a fire in an attempt to exorcise my blunder. I could have crapped on a sheet of paper and produced a more remarkable work. I agree completely with the above (or below) post in saying if you use any of these trite sample toasts you should be ashamed of yourself. I'll go further in saying that no book can help you develop a meaningful toast, it must come from within."
3,"Content Good, Presentation Poor","I'm rating this item better than two stars only because the content is adequet and it delivers the needed information. The construction itself is the equivalent to me printing out ten pages from MS Word, stapling them in the center and pretending that its a book. Don't expect for this document to last past it's original purpose."
2,hearing protection at the range,"Took these hearing protectors to the range the day after I received them. They looked nice and had a slim profile. Too bad they did little to lessen the hurt to my ears from the rifle percussion. Tried adjusting them every which way, but no avail. Went back to my old ear protectors so I could finish my shooting. Save your money and apply it to a better set of hearing muffs."
3,Jackson likes it too.,"Just wish it was a little bit bigger. My dog is 88 lbs and he does fit on it, but his other bed gives him more room to stretch out. Don't think it was worth 100$ though. Other beds purchased at discount stores for 1/2 the price.Needed a bed for him because we were taking him to the Cape and this one is just ok."
5,Extra Large Pet Bed,My large dog went right to it and is very comfortable. It has a zippered cover so I can wash it. I need to do that.
3,It's okay.,"I bought this bed for my two larger dogs. One has hip and back issue so I wanted to buy a good, thick bed. One weighs 80 pounds and the other dog weighs around 60. I bought the larger sized bed and they both love it, however, within one month the middle of it is broken down and it's only about 1"" thick now. Again, my dogs love the bed, but it broke down too quickly. The cover does wash up very nicely and was easy to get on and off by myself. I think this would be a good bed for a dog that doesn't weigh much, but I don't recommend for a heavier dog."
5,perfect for our Great Danes!,The extra large beds are the perfect size for our Great danes. We bought two beds in Burgandy and they are perfect. We have had them about a month and the dogs sleep on them all day. So far there is no indention from where they lay and they are thick enough to support the weight of 125lb+ dogs. Even when both danes sleep on the same bed the bed does not smush down. I bought zippered waterproof twin mattress covers to put between the bedfoam and the cover so they would be waterproof and drool proof. Keeps the smell down and makes the beds last three times as long. i have washed the burgandy covers once and did not have very much shrinking. there was a little shrinkage but not enough to cause concern. We are looking to get another smaller one for our cat because he cuddles up with the dogs on the bed. Great purchase!
4,WHOO HOO!,ThiS Cd KiCkS ALL KiNdS Of ArSe! BleSsEd Be.. NufF' Said. PlAy FiNe AgAiN... I ThiNk I'Ve WoRn OuT ThE TrAcK. Ohhhhh WeLL.
1,A real piece of junk,This product makes a big mess all over the counter top. Great if you like cleaning up tea. Tried to contact Mr. Coffee for any type of help with no response whatsoever. Really surprised that this product is still on the market.
5,"Beautiful photos, great articles","I have sent gift subscriptions of this magazine. The articles cover hunting, fishing, parks and conservation. The photos of the great state of Montana are outstanding. Anyone loving the outdoors would appreciate this magazine."
1,False Advertising,This book contains virtually none of the great material that was previously in the STATS handbook. Anyone familiar with the STATS handbook will be misled by the false advertising and implications that STATS combined their efforts with TSN to create a better handbook. I won't be fooled again next year!
4,Good reference,"I like this book as a reference/review, perhaps as a companion to other subject material. It doesn't have a lot or worked examples and so can't really be thought of as an introductory tutorial. It is very thorough and provides a moderately deep overview of the subject. Undergrad engineering math is a prereq for understanding the book. It is very expensive as a new book; however, in used form I think it is well worth the price (at just a fraction of the new price)."
5,Baker Street,This version of Baker Street by the Foo Fighters is worth the CD. The guitar is inspiring and the energy this song provides will make sing the song in your head for days
5,It will surprise you.,"Not all the songs are the greatest covers but there a some shockingly good tracks. ""Baker st."" is a stand out but ""Wish you were here"" is also very well ""interpreted"". I would say it is definitely worth the dollar or so you can purchase it for right now on Amazon, so just get the CD it will grow on you more and more trust me."
3,A few gems in the rough,"I bought this CD years ago for the Foo Fighter cover, and the collection still holds a place in my heart. Aside from Baker Street, there really are some worthwhile songs on here: great songs covered by unknown artists (Ode to Billy Joe by John Butler) and good songs covered by great bands that were not yet popular when the cd was produced (Wish You Were Here by Sparklehorse). Most of the songs never really caught on with me, but there are a few, like 'When You're In Love With A Beautiful Woman' by Cecil, that have made it on to my mixed cds year after year. Bottom line: there are a few really amazing parts that make the album worth it, if you have the spare cash."
3,Credit where credit is due,"Some of these great old movies should be on Turner Classic Movies to appreciate the early days of film. Jack Haley was at his best , except for his singing voice, which belonged to the late Buddy Cl;ark, and was kept hidden from the viewers.Best known for his part in The Wizard of Oz, Haley's dancing was among the best, but his voice was not."
3,Amarok,"To say I love the works of Mike Oldfield is an understatement, so I purchased this concept albumwith very high expectations. All I can say is ""that's why they make chocolate and vanilla""....some like C and some like V....I like Chocolate and this (to me) is vanilla. I'll give it a few more listens as I'm driving home from work and see if itgrows on me. Still enjoy this amazingly talented person's body of work either way."
5,Whoa...,"I don't care what *anyone* says, this CD is astounding. The Aborigine-esque opening was cool, the stomping and teethbrushing fitted amazingly in with everything, the drum solo/Zulu chant 45 minutes in was really catchy, and the Margaret Thatcher impression at the end (or was it the beginning?) was a great way to finish (or was it to start?). Also, the ""Health Warning"" on the back of the case is hilarious but true."
1,seriously boring ego trip by a dried up former genius,"He must be kidding. And the insult to listeners on the outside of the cd. If we don't like it we're ""cloth eared""? Whatever. If Mike has to be so defensive as to insult us before we've even listened to the cd then something's wrong. And something is very wrong with the cd; everything. It's boring, pointless, unorganized, just another Oldfield ego trip. Like we needed another? Where did the genius who created Ommadawn go? ... It's a shame, really."
5,This is the real deal folks!,"After reading up on the difference between real blackstrap molasses and the ones currently in the stores, I wanted molasses that had good rich flavor and nutritional value. I searched until I found Barry Farm's Blackstrap Molasses. I read reviews and found that this is the kind of molasses I grew up with, very strong, not extremely sweet and a little goes a long way. I purchased this and was taken back to my mom's kitchen when I tasted it. I use it to make cookies, in oatmeal for my family, in marinades, and it makes the best homemade bbq sauce-thick and rich!"
1,Not the usual quality of this scent,"I've been wearing this scent almost every day since it first came out in 1993. I couldn't know it any better.This bottle started to smell 'off' after just a short time, like it must have been old to begin with.Very unhappy, will not purchase here again."
4,It was really good!,It was a really good perfume except that it was kinda open or unsealed which was a bit awkward !!! But thanks!
4,The Counselors: Conversations With 18 Courageous Women...,"I found The Counselors to be an approachable and personal vehicle for learning about 18 (potentially intimidating) women within a single volume. I particularly like it because of its conversational style. I have read biographies of some of the women included in this book (and enjoyed them). I found that this book adds to the feminist discourse by presenting a new perspective that speaks to readers like myself and also to those who are just becoming interested in law, women's studies or government. I would recommend this to readers already privileged enough to be a part of an academic discussion of feminism and to less traditional audiences who are looking for a way to learn about women in law/government and perhaps be inspired to pursue a career in these or other fields that might appear intimidating."
5,Not only for women,"I think the stories told in this book, are not only inspiring for women but for men as well. No matter which are the circumstances, there is always a way, and this book help you understand it."
1,A treasure trove of useless information,"This is probably one of the worst books I've had the misfortune to peruse in quite some time. It is not particularly well written, and the stories presented are unbelievably sanguine. It sounds as though the author simply asked the women what they wanted in the book and wrote it as a panacea to them; there is no critical eye. Obviously, the author is not a trained journalist or a polished writer. Additionally, most of the more interesting information, e.g. on Pat Schroeder or Sandra Day O'Conner, can be found in their much better written autobiographies. If you're familar with recent books on women's studies or politics, you'll know that there's not much new under the sun here. My council on the Counselors: Save your money."
5,KUDOS TO ELIZABETH,"What a book! The tone, style, and subject matter are so great that it makes me want to read it over again. Kudos to Elizabeth for taking this subject at hand and giving us a different perspective on all these great women. The young readers of today have an opportunity to view the struggles of allo these women who have made life easier for them. Thank God someone was creative enough to bring all these women to us with their personal stories and wisdom."
5,The Counselors--wonderful book,"I found this book entertaining and more importantly, very helpful in my own career. The stories provided are inspirational. Ms. Vrato makes these women of accomplishment seem real. (For example, see the chapter on Janet Reno.) I recommend this book as must reading for any young professional, male or female."
4,Silhouettes CD,"This was a very enjoyable CD. Soft jazz, easy listening, glad I bought it. The seller was quick and the product arrived in pristine condition. I'll use this seller again..."
2,Too small for 8.5 x 11..,"This could potentially work for small envelopes, but for 8.5 x 11 sheets it is way too small. Manila folders flop over. Seems well constructed and pretty sturdy, though."
5,Works great for what I need it,"It is relatively inexpensive and does the job. Holds my papers just fine and helps keep me organized. It also does not take up too much space on my desk, which is nice."
2,Way over rated,"As a mystery this book was just OK, if even that. I enjoyed Foucault's Pendulum because with that book you learned a lesson that I often think about. I was expecting something similar with this book but all I got was a book that was a pain in the rear to read and did not offer anything of substance for the effort."
2,"Hello, Sir Arthur!","The only reason I finished this book was its abundance of words, and I really wanted to practice my Italian. If you don't have this goal in mind - don't bother.The book is really wordy, boring, slightly amusing, and quite pointless. Murder mystery very much like those by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, although completely lacking any hint of brilliance, set in a 14th century monastery, injected with some doctrine, some history, some Latin. (And when I say ""some"", I mean a lot). It leaves you with a lingering aftertaste of wasted time and trees.The author has an obsession with written word and should stick to semiotics."
2,I don't get it,"Maybe I lack the classical training needed to appreciate this book. I found it tedious. The author is continually going off on long philosophic or pedantic discussions that as far as I could see had nothing to do with the development of the characters or the plot. After the first third of the book I found myself skipping many pages at a time to get to the place where he dropped the intellectual tedium and got back to the story. Call me shallow, but I just don't get pleasure out of this type of writing. As a positive note, it only took me a few pages until I was fast asleep."
5,Memories,I read this book in highschool and have nothing but the fondest memories of the writing of umberto eco. i recomend this book with the greatest amount of confidance in it's literary value and as in most works of fiction which resulted in a movie it far outshines its theatrical followup which if you can think back that far was an outstanding film with capable preformances by sean connery and the like i belive that there was an oscer given for that preformance..... but i digress. the name of the rose is a truly remarkable offering by mr. eco and deffinately worth the 10.50.
5,"So Many Books, All ""Not As Good As The Name of the Rose""","If I have to name the few rare books whose impact on me has not diminished over time, I'd include ""1984"", ""The Lord of the Flies"", ""The Name of the Rose"", and ""Age of Innocence"". Umberto Eco's masterpiece towers over everything else in the categories of historical fiction, mystery, and thrillers. It will challenge you intellectually, yet also thrill you out of your breath. When you are done, you may feel a bit depressed that the book is over. As a partial remedy, follow up with ""An Instance of the Finger Post"", which displays much of the former's brilliance."
5,this is not a review but,"if you give this book five stars and then proceed to employ cliched literary jargon to sing its virtues you have missed one of the major themes of Eco's works which is the complete deconstruction of ""grand truths"" and the re-examination of their application to facts, real or imaginedtell us why YOU liked it not your pseudo-semiotician college professoralso if you compare this book to the alienist i truly feel sorry for your reading future"
5,The Name of the Rose,"The Name of the RoseAn elegant and well research book on medieval thinking, theology and a good who done it into the bargain.The theme of the book is tolerance - in an age of intolerance.Love it Love it"
4,"A rose by any other name, would smell as sweet?","OK, I admit it! I saw the movie first and was enchanted by Sean Connery's excellent performance. After that I decided to read the book, and boy! This is what I would call an ""intellectual thriller."" It's not an easy read, but it is so emotionally gripping that you just can't put it down!Eco is one of the better modern writers, and The Name of the Rose is his best work yet. It's highly recommended to all of you who like intelligent and entertaining books. If you're a Sidney Sheldon fan, don't expect to like this..."
5,I was mesmerized!,"After seeing the movie, ""The Name of the Rose"", I started reading the book with some apprehension since I already knew how it ended. Wow! Was I in for a surprise! The movie is barely an outline of the story in comparison to the book. The descriptions, the language and most of all the mysteries (because there are mysteries within the main mystery of the novel)kept me reading every spare second. I would recommend this novel to anyone. I am not the type of person who reads a book more than once, but I believe I would read this one again. Enjoy!!"
5,Seeking William of Ockham,"I just finished Iain Pears' ""An Instance of the Fingerpost"", which is set in the Oxford of early Restoration England, my favorite historical era. Ironically, it sent me scrambling to learn more about William of Ockham, the Franciscan at Oxford whose 14th-century critique of Aquinas' universals so irritated the Pope at Avignon. ""The Name of the Rose"" is set in Ockham's lifetime (~1285 to ~1350) and features an English-born and observant Franciscan who is also well versed in logic, so it looks to be a good next read. I found the film to be entertaining (oh, that Sean Connery!) but thin. However, these reviews lead me to believe that I will find the book quite absorbing. Thanks for the reviews!"
3,Medieval Murder-Mystery,"A great murder mystery set in medieval times. I felt like the main character, William, was a modern character in medieval times. Apparently, I wasn't the only one that thought this because he addresses it the post script and says that the passages that most people find too ""modern"" are direct quotes from 14th century texts. I thought the medieval attitude was well portrayed in this book. You could feel the attitude that the world is in decline and that the old days were better than they are now. I like how he also mentions that there isn't a story that hasn't already been told. He talks a lot about books and how ""books speak of other books."" I loved this book, but the beginning was hard to get through. There's a lot of history that he goes through so get out your Google skills, but it was worth it by the time I got to the end."
5,Apocolyptic Whodunnit,"Starts out as a regular whodunnit, except it's in time long past. Then, the reader quickly sees that this is no ordinary mystery. Hopefully, readers will not simply be entertained, but changed instead."
4,Eco's Story is Essential also in English,"This comes from a long-time Eco/The Name of The Rose fan.. You come to realize that this book is not the easiest to read, you find stories and descriptions in it that sometimes are extremely long and exhausting, sometimes you might struggle with the fact that the whole story is fictious though claimed to be partly a true story.But then, what you get is a great novel filled with mysteries and lessons of our history. Great characters that I find so easy to relate to. You learn about semiotics too (science that I always found fascinating), and most of all 'The Rose' will guide your way to become an investigator and more observant reader - if that is something you desire! Read it!"
5,One of my favorite books of all time,"As I first read ""The Name of the Rose"", it must now be well over 10 years ago, I was facinated by the murder mystery. Later on it was Ecos' fabulous discriptions (I even drew my own lay-out of the labyrinth) I must have read it over the years at least 10 times including in different languages to better my skills. I only wish I could read it in its original italian. I recommend it highly."
4,worth the effort,"I think reviewer J. Mullin has hit the nail on the head, calling THE NAME OF THE ROSE ""a rewarding but painstaking read."" Often I felt that my enjoyment of the novel was like that of one of the groundlings at a performance of HAMLET. That is, there's an exciting murder mystery going on but there's a lot that's going over my head, what with all the passages in Latin.That said, this is a highly enjoyable caper set in a medieval Italian monastery, a setting ripe with atmosphere to say the least, that should appeal to intelligent readers as well as the admittedly middle-brow folks such as myself. I did not have the companion books available when I read it, so I simply skimmed over parts that I didn't udnerstand until I got back to the meat of the story. Perhaps someday I will revisit the book and get even more out of it."
5,So far so great!,"I have been wanting to read this book for awhile, and I finally broke down and bought it and the ""key"". Well, I'm not even halfway through it and it is one of the best books I've read. I dont know how people say that the beginning is dull and hard to get through, Im only about 160 some pages into it and Im writing this review because I cant keep reading it now because I have to go to work in four hours. I highly reccomend anyone this book."
3,Difficult to recommend,"This is a difficult novel to recommend to the average reader of historical fiction. The basis is an in depth analysis of the history of monks, of all denominations, and their effect on politics and religion during the upheaval of the Vatican. It is intertwined with a Sherlock Holmes style mystery that underscores the foundation of devotion this period produced in these religious groups. It is not an easy read, you must have an interest in these subjects to enjoy this book. I could not recommend this book to anyone who wants an historical overview with a bit of fiction to keep up interest. It is difficult and deep but worth it if you are into a serious lesson."
3,The movie was better,"I agree with most of the complaints of those reviewers who gave this novel 3 stars or less. I have no doubt that it was a big hit with the Italians as it goes into great depth, way too much depth, on the local politics of the time, something that would naturally be of interest to Italians moreso than to readers at large. Having seen the movie (starring Sean Connery), I was looking forward to reading the book because I love mysteries regardless of the historical setting. However, I was at times bored with the erudition (to borrow a fitting term used by other reviewers). Still, because there was an interesting mystery woven in among the dry historical lessons, I give it three stars. For those who, after reading some of these reviews, might hesitate reading or purchasing the book, rent the movie. It isnt' the best mystery movie I have ever seen but it does capture the essence of the mystery without the history lessons. And, I like Sean Connery."
5,Ruined the medieval fantasy for me,"Aside from being a fun read (it's a medieval murder mystery), I liked ""The Name Of The Rose"" because it showed clearly the distinction between the medieval mindset and the modern mindset, at a time when the modern mindset was struggling to come into existence. None of the characters are truly modern men, but the two protagonists are the closest. Their antagonists embody the medieval mindset quite thoroughly and unappealingly.This book ruined the romantic fantasy of the middle ages for me, and gave me an appreciation for modernity in its widest sense."
5,magnificent,"IFollowing one review published here,I would like to note I do understand that some poeple do not have time and energy to read some books, but that doesnot allowed them to speak about the book just because they`ve heard it is valuable to read.I have read ""The name of the rose"" and find it very intriguing and written with tremendeous skill. Umberto Eco is one of the best novelist in the world. Not to many novelist are condsider good these days (if we speak about level of Tolstoy or Dostoyevski). What I find most fascinated regarding Eco`s novels, particulary this one is that ""smell"" of middle century. Literally you can feel the atmosfere of the monastery and the dialogues are beyond the ordinary...At the end, no one can read Dostoyevski but everyone can read Helen Fielding. I dont want to insult but that does not means she will be remmembered."
4,"Deep, intricate, philosophical ""low"" art form","Umberto Eco uses the mystery novel, an art-form erroneously considered low by some critics, to explore deep philosophical issues including the nature of philosophy and knowledge. The labrynthine library is a symbol of the world, filled with knowledge but nearly uncomprehendable in whole. This book reminds me of the works of science fiction writer Gene Wolfe in its influence by Jorge Luis Borges, deep symbolism, and philosophical thought in a genre looked down upon ny many psuedo-intellectuals."
3,In Desperate Need of an Editor,"Although I have enjoyed multiple viewings of the movie (which boldly translates the Latin Eco does not), I was encouraged to go back and read the book. What a huge disappointment! There were sentences which ran on for a paragraph just enumerating items. There were paragraphs which went on for pages. The gist of the story is an excellent murder mystery wrapped in a philosophical discussion about rationality and religion. But the man desperately needed an editor. Deflated, the book would be worth reading. Unfortunately, I had to struggle through all the bloviation to get to the good stuff."
5,Excellent and insightful,"I particularly enjoyed the insight into what people may have been thinking at the time the book was set. I felt like I understood much better the late Middle Ages and it's relevance to understanding human nature today. In particular, this helped me gain more insight into clashes of civilizations that is more important to understand in this century than ever before."
2,Unreadable!!!,I was given this book for my birthday and I tried to read it. I had such a hard time reading the book which seemed to drag on and on. Eco seems to go into tangeants and details such mundane scenes that I didn't get past page 30. I am an avid reader and have read everything from fiction to non-fiction to classics. I just couldn't get into the book and found it difficult to read.
2,Not a 5-star read,"To potential readers: don't pick this one up if you are looking for an easy read. There was more of a focus on the philosophy and religion of the era than on the murder mystery, which I wish I had known before I picked up the book. I did find parts of the book to be pretty good, but for me it wasn't worth struggling through 400 pages to enjoy the other 100. If you aren't interested in religion, philosophy, and history of this time period, you probably won't get much out of this one."
4,Una obra maestra.,"Leer esta novela significo un gran esfuerzo para mi, dado que era muy pequeño para entender gran parte del contenido. Pero aun asi disfrute muchisimo la trama y toda esa descripcion acerca de la abadia y los monges. Percibi el enorme esfuerzo intelectual que el autor tuvo que realizar para elaborar el libro. Y eso me parecio genial. Cuando grande deseo ser un intelectual al estilo de Umberto Eco."
3,#overrated,"Most overrated book I have read in the last 2-3 years. It is a dressed up, yet still onerous murder mystery. Glad I read it because I was very curious but very underwhelmed."
3,Got Latin?,"I bought this book after seeing the movie of the same name starring Sean Connery, with the view that the book had to be better than the movie. It wasn't. While admittedly a fascinating story, the book was saturated with dialog between Brother William of Baskerville and his pupil Adso of Melk, which made the reader feel as if he was intruding in a personal conversation. Additionally, there was entirely too much Latin used in the book. If the Latin were confined to an isolated phrase here and there, fine, but I found myself having to skip entire paragraphs, because they were written in Latin. This made the book very difficult to read, and although I knew the premise of the book from having seen the movie, very difficult to enjoy as fully as I'd hoped. It would be a much better book if footnotes translating the Latin had been included, but it was a fascinating story nevertheless."
4,Excellent historic novel,"The name of the rose is one of those books that when you start reading them appear to be somewhat boring. But it was definitely not. Life in monasteries during the middle ages is incredibly depicted, and Umberto Eco builds a story of increasing mistery page after page.Murders, passion, religion, philosophy and love are mixed to give birth to an astonishing book. Of course, you have to cope with many latin citations to fully understand the plot."
2,"Too many speeches, not enough focus on character & narrative flow","2-1/2 stars. It obviously took much research and skill to write such a book in such a manner, but that doesn't mean its the most readable thing ever written. I can only go through so many speeches about whether laughter is good or evil and whether purposely not owning anything beyond the clothes on your back is good or evil before boredom sets in. The monastic setting of this book is fascinating and in addition to being very educational, technically the plot is action packed with a monk getting killed every day and a predecessor to the Sherlock Holmes & Watson team trying to figure out the mystery before the next death. Yet it manages to read like a dissertation on religion in the days of yore rather than an edge of your seat whodunnit, and that kept me from rounding up to 3 stars."
1,"Two, two, two books in one, not counting the Postscript","TNOTR is two books uncomfortably mated in one manuscript. One is a conventional, not very unusual historical mystery novel, a pastiche of the Sherlock Holmes stories with Occam thrown in. The other is a tedious textbook on heresy. If you must read this book consider skipping every other chapter."
3,Two Books in One,"Interesting murder mystery; boring and obscure book on philosophy. Clearly Eco is a brilliant guy, but not every brilliant guy makes a great novelist. None of the characters really comes off the page. William is nicely complex, and Bernard Gui is an interesting villian, but the convoluted plot is hard to follow and some of the incidents and characters eventually become dead ends. Not that interesting considering all the glowing media praise. I was ultimately disappointed. Now I want to watch the movie and see if the adaptation is more entertaining. I saw it years ago, but hardly remember it."
4,"Monks, Madness, and Murder","Reading this novel was both challenging and rewarding. The in depth theological/philosophical debates between the monks are brilliant. The setting of the novel is intricately woven, the reader is immersed in an enthralling world and story. I disliked two things. First the author often includes non-engligh sentences in the dialog without explaining or translating the meaning. Second Eco's postscript is offensive. I was excited to see it, thinking I may learn more about themes and symbolism in the novel. I was shocked to find the author insulting the reader. I was left feeling like an uncivilized clod, who lacked the sophistication to even turn the pages his masterpiece because I couldn't grasp all the symbolism and intertextuality on my own."
3,"If you like Eco, then you'll love this book","This is the second Umberto Eco novel I've read. The other wasBaudolino. I only made it half way through Baudolino before giving up (and I'm loath to stop in the middle of a book). But I wanted to give Umberto Eco a second try and received ""The Name of the Rose"" as a Christmas present.First, this book is significantly better the Baudolino. Here all the action takes place in an Abbey in Northern Italy and the plot is focused on a series of murders. The plot in Baudolino was all over the place, geographically and topically. I really enjoyed reading most of the book, but the ending (which I will not spoil although a previous reviewer has) is ultimately disappointing and left a ""bad taste"" in my mouth. Eco is a renown post-modern author and this novel, especially the ending, fits into that category perfectly, so if you enjoy post-modernist writing or Eco's other novels this is worth reading. Otherwise, you should probably pass."
4,1300 medieval Italy,"Adso de Melk, a young Benedictine novice, follows Franciscan Brother William of Baskerville, to facilitate a meeting between Pope John XXII's and Louis the Bavarian's emissaries. Through their journey, they end in an Italian Abbey. There they will find a large library, protected fiercely by the Abbot and a librarian, a body of monks who diligently copy and illustrate books. The Abbey has many mysteries and several deaths follow. The book takes us in a fascinating journey of emotions and beliefs in the 1300 century. The days of Adso and his reflections are majestically described. It made reflect on how many injustices were made in the name of God. I found the first pages hard to follow, yet the book is easier to follow after the first chapter."
5,Sublime,I have been fascinated with The Name of the Rose for at least 15 years. The story is amazing and the language and descriptions divine. I now have Theodore Bikel's narration of Eco's masterpiece and have been listening to it non-stop for the last three weeks...I think I'm on my sixth round and will keep listening! Each round brings new bits of the story to light and enriches my understanding of a very interesting (and terrifying) time in Europe's history.
5,It's the best!,"This book is the best. I have never read anything so good in my life. In fact, I think this is the best book I have ever read, even after reading it for the 15th time. It's not generic at all. It's very specific and insightful. It's really interesting too. If I could write a better review, I would, but I can't. So instead, I am going to comment on the other reviews written here. They are all wrong! I am going to make fun of them -- they are dumb (oh, how witty) This book is really, really, good."
2,"Sarah, enough of the same song over and over!","I am a huge fan of Sarah McLachlan and always will be, though one area she's weak in is her choice of b-sides for her singles. Not surprisingly, Sarah provides us with 5 remixes of the same song, and it grows quite tiresome. The radio mix of the song is great, placing a higher emphasis on her gorgeous voice, though the same cannot be said for the dance remixes. Sarah's songs nor her voice are suitable for a dance remix. Can you honestly say it's enjoyable to hear her say ""Sweet Surrender"" over and over? Whenever Sarah releases another album, I hope she puts some amazing b-sides on her singles."
5,I've used this for over 10 years,"and could NOT be happier. I got this when I went away to college, and I continue to use the recipes today. My first copy is stapled together in lots of places, and some pages still have traces of flour from where I've used the same recipe time and time again. WONDERFUL choice as a first cookbook, but gourmet enough to impress dinner guests."
5,Great for anyone with a Whitcomb heritage!,This is the genealogy of all the whitcombs from the first Whitcomb that came to america and anyone can trace backwards from the last generation listed backwards. My grandfather was the last generation listed and our family documented from him forward. All the hard work tracing back was already done for me. What a great job was done. My grandfather had managed to get the book way back when it was first published and now apparently there is enough Whitcombs out there to have amazon willing to offer it online. Bought each of my children a copy of it so this information won't be lost to them either. I wish I had my mothers side documented for me like this. Lots of information about family members included.
3,Think before buying this one,"As the title says, this book is about ""New Directions"", which loosely translates to High End, Over the top designs. If you are into contemporary designs, a student of Jewellery design (high end not a bead stringer!), then you will love this book, it is inspirational with at least 80% of the book. The other 20% is just plain silly. It is not jewellery, it is more a garment or sculpture. Probably only 50% of the pieces shown could be worn in every day use, the rest is destined for a catwalk exhibition or gallery. If you are not in the above category you will hate this book, plain and simple and probably wish you had purchased something else."
2,Not what I wanted,"I am a jewelry designer myself and it often inspires me when I see interesting jewelry by other artists. My work is sometimes considered to be a bit out there, but definitely wearable. So photos are important to me, not prose. The first part of this book is essays which may please others but not me. The rest of the book is indeed photos, but most of the work isn't wearable and much of it isn't interesting to me. Much of it is more art, less jewelry. Lots of it was tacky-looking, in my opinion. I often get inspiration from all kinds of non-jewelry things; nature, fabrics, clothing, shapes, materials. These pieces didn't do anything for me. I was really disappointed."
3,Most of the collection are not detective stories,"For those who are too young to have read the Strand, this book provides a valuable sellection of short stories, or rather, tales from the famous Magazine. Most of them are very interesting and entertaining, but I admit only a handful can be called detective stories, which, in my view, should focus on the course of detection, rather than simply telling a story that involves crime and criminal."
1,Difficult at best.,A very difficult read at best. Sorry to have spent the money on this one. On very good sources the other positive reviews are from the author's family and friends. Unfortunately I was very dissapointed.
1,terrible,They precut the housing in to uselessly short lengths that won't fit most bikes. Don't get halfway through your cable change and realize they've screwed you like me.
4,Does what it's supposed to do,Must-have accessory for the BOB running stroller - especially in tropical climates where it rains frequently. Set up is easy and quick and you can fold it and store it in the storage pouch below the stroller. Thumbs up for this.
5,"perfect for 1"" binders!","I am a teacher and I keep everything organized in 1"" binders and then I needed a way to keep the binders themselves organized and this was PERFECT! The slots are wide and are great for text books too!"
2,Not waterproof,I have not found any materiel that is really waterproof except rubber. That includes gore-Tex. My feet were moist after using for only 1 hr in semi wet conditions.
2,HORRIBLE SMELL,These are not bad wading socks other than the fact they will start smelling really bad after about the third or fourth use. I wash them regularly after each use also to no avail. They retain a horrible mildew stink no matter how long you soak them. I would not reccoumend just because of this problem. I am a clean person and wash all my clothes regularly and cannot believe how horrible these socks stink.
1,"Keeps water in, smells like death","I used these socks once for a ten mile run in snow. By the middle of the run my feet were sloshing from the acculumated sweat. When I took them off, I could literally squeeze water out of the socks. Not only that, after one use they smelled that something had died in them.Don't depend on these for long sporting activities."
4,Waterproof Socks,So glad to have found waterproof socks for a fair price. They work well because my feet can stay dry. Cannot say if they make my feet sweat or not because both of my feet are amputated. It is great to be able to wash the car and enter a kayak without getting my feet wet and developing mold. They are not too thick to wear in my shoes and dry fast. After other kayakers have seen my socks they want some as well.
4,So Far... So dry,"So Far, So good...They are water proof, and keep my feet dry...I cant really speak on keeping my feet warm as I havent tested them in cold conditions...When I do, I will leave another review.."
1,horrible,This is a really flawed concept. The problem is that even if they do happen to work they do not release sweat. So your feet maybe water free but what good is that if your foot is soaked in sweat. If this weren't enough water does come through the fabric.
1,socks,these people are horrible i orderd wool socks and they sent me nylon and i paid more money for wool nylon would have been cheaperit says odor proof on the box almost every day i got a complain that they smelli wash them and the same day they smell they have a horrible odor that comes
5,amazing,"I have been using these socks for the last month for winter kayaking. Getting in and out of my kayak I step in the nice cold river water. These socks keep my feet totally dry and are much more comfortable than the gortex socks or rubber socks that I've had in the past. They also offer insulation and allow me to wear fleece socks underneath for added insulation. I've had 2 other friends buy these socks and we all LOVE them.Note: The top of the sock is not sealed so if you step in too deep of water, it can get in from the top. Seal Skinz do make socks that have a seal at the top although I don't know how good they work."
4,Good for jogging,"I like to jog at the park in the morning. Sometimes the grass is wet, with dew and my running shoes get soaked. It doesn't matter that much when it's warm, but now that the weather is cooler, I needed to try something. These socks work. When I wear these socks, with a light sock underneath them, my feet stay comfortably warm and dry. After the run, the inner socks are wet from perspiration, but dry from the grass. I guess that wearing these socks for more than a couple of hours would result with enough sweat inside them to be about equal to not wearing waterproof socks, but for an hour run, they work great."
1,Does not work,"I have 2 pair of gloves, 4 pair of socks. Out of the 12 items only 1 is water proof. If you only dip it in water for a second it will be water proof, anything over 1 second it is going to leak. I wear the socks under my water shoes while I get into my kayak, I am in water just below my ankle for about 3 seconds, that all it takes to make them leak. They seem to be ok for a few wearings but after that-wet feet. Same for the gloves."
3,Culture as Circus,"In Carnival on the Page, Isabelle Lehuu argues that antebellum America was a 'liminal era' situated uneasily between the restrained republicanism of the early national period and the soulless commercialism of the late nineteenth century. Drawing on the theories of ritual anthropology, Lehuu contends that this 'betweenness' manifested itself in a vibrant, carnivalesque, and subversive print culture. Focussing on genres that pushed the definition of the book, Lehuu offers analyses of the sensational penny press, mammoth news sheets, gift books, and sentimental magazines. Her theory is that each form reflected the proliferating diversity of antebellum culture and refused to be constrained by traditional forms of authority. Although Lehuu's style can be ponderous at times and her contentions a little on the speculative side, this book will appeal to historians, literary critics, and cultural theorists for its subject matter and suggestive approach."
2,Disappointment.,This book was poorly written and very hard to follow. It is difficult to find her main argument and probably the best way to describe her writing is: a cluster of words thrown onto a page.
4,Cuba's greatest crooner,"The late Beny More was Cuban's greatest singer; a master in everything from mambo to boleros. ""Lo Mejor de Beny More"" is More in a nutshell. Here ""El Barbaro del Ritmo"" - literally ""The Barbarian of Rhythm,"" though the Spanish ""Barbaro"" has a less negatvie connotation -- shines in some of his best cuts. You can dance to them and you can make love to them. What more can you ask for?"
3,A deceiving collection - opt for 'Discography' instead,"The title of this CD - 'Essentials' - is deceiving. It's a collection of alternative mixes of the Pet Shop Boys' greatest hits. How can something be termed the 'essentials' when fully half of the tracks are ""previously unavailable on compact disc""? There's a reason these takes aren't the ones that were released as singles: 'alternative' here can be thought of as a code word for ""just not up to snuff with the version we released as a single.""If you want the Pet Shop Boys at their best, go forDiscography: The Complete Singles Collection- that collection represents 'the essentials,' not this one."
2,Not a bad TV,"I bought this a long, long, time ago (5 years) and it was my first HDTV, right around when LCD was becoming a legitimate technology.Things I remember:-Even for 26"", this thing is HEAVY.-Did not have handles (but had some other indentations that doubled as handles)-Black levels were excellent-16:9 was not accurate (cut off certain portions of UI's when playing Xbox 360, made it hard to tell how much ammo I had)-Sound quality was actually pretty good, but it probably had more space to put speakers with the ridiculous depth)-This thing stuck out really far from my wallIf you can snag this on eBay for a sub $150 price, I'd get it."
5,wow.,"this story is emotional and gripping. It keeps you on edge at all times and gives you great insight to Britain's role in Iraq, something that not many Americans get to see."
5,Basra: Front Line and Aftermath,"A somewhat slow moving at times, but always gripping film depicting the lives of British troops in Basra, Iraq, 2003. There's a statement saying it's fictional, but inspired by real events. I remember at the time that all this was going on that the British media stated that the British troops were conducting a more sensitive operation, winning over ""hearts and minds"", instead of adopting an apparently more crass approach, like America reportedly was. The truth emerged later, following publication of unpleasant souvenir photos featuring British soldiers and Iraqis, plus video footage showing an incident of British soldiers assaulting Iraqi civilians.Excellent acting and script; a disturbing, but enlightening film."
5,This apple doesn't spoil...,"This is an excellent fiction film about torture in Iraq. Shane Gulliver and Mark Tate are stationed in Basra. When their company's captain is killed during a mission, they capture two alleged suspects and are told to use whatever means necessary to extract information (i.e. torture). This film captures the difficult task of maintaining a personal code of ethics inside a powerful organization like the military. With the success of docs like 'Taxi to the Dark Side' and 'Standard Operating Procedure', hopefully this film will continue to spotlight the military's blatant disregard for the standards of the Geneva Convention. The cinematography is haunting and the acting noteworthy, definitely deserving of the BAFTA award it won this year."
1,Plain Language?,"My review of The Dose Makes the Poison A plain Language Guide to Toxicology has to be one of worst books written regarding Poison. Very little supporting facts, lots of mambo jumbo , makes your head spin.I was extremely disappointed in this book. Save you funds for anything but this bookNo stars if I could give it.No recommendation available"
4,MARVEL LEGENDS MODOK SERIES BETA RAY BILL,this was probably one of my favorite figures i picked up for my son. beta ray Bill looks really cool. if u can get one at good price jump on it.
2,Works but Case gets very hot,"Works but case gets very hot.According to Tripp, unit uses about 1A of power in standby mode. Since the batteries are charged most of the time, the power is coverted to heat. The case gets very warm and since I have mine in an entertainment cabinet, it just becomes a 120 watt heating element. I have several UPS units and this is the only one which gets hot. Its a poor design to waste 120 watts of power 24/7. It only takes a couple watts to trickle charge the batteries. Tripp offered to replace it but stated the new one would have the same issue. I would not have purchased this if I knew it put out 100 plus watts of heat 24/7."
5,"Nice rear plug unit, dimmable display","I purchased this backup since the plugs are on the rear of the unit. I have a hard time finding a place for the other designs where the plugs on the top. There is still room for the larger transformers if needed. I have not had the situation reported by the one other review on power dissipation. The unit when powered on, display hat half brightness and battery charged only pulls 131 mA. That's 15.72 watts, a long way from the 120+ watts reported previously. This is about what the other three ups that I have pull with no load. I use this ups for an eight channel security DVR and have had no problems."
3,"Good CD, but not Great","The CD has two or three good songs (maybe 4 at the most), but the other songs are pretty bad. The Stone's song definatly isn't worthy of any rewards. However, it is a great romantic CD."
4,One of the most touching soundtracks,"I am not a big fan of soundtracks. This cd though, is very touching. many of the songs are good but, buy this cd for Garth Brook's song ""To Make You Feel My Love"" It is one of the most beautiful songs you will ever hear. The song is about a person who will do anything to make that special someone feel the love that they have for them. It's a sad song, but the lyrics are simple yet powerful. You cannot go wrong with this single."
5,This is the best investment in music!,"This movie made me think and this music touched my heart. There is something on this cd for everyone. Of course most people have heard ""To Make You Feel My Love,"" but my personal favorites are those songs by Sheryl Crow, Bob Seger & Martina McBride, The Mavericks, Deana Carter, and Lila McCann. Although the cd is mostly country, there are also tracks by the Rolling Stones and Bryan Adams. This is the cd that you can play over and over again without ever having to skip songs. It sympathizes with you, heals you, and lifts you up. A definate must-have for anyone who has ever been in a relationship!"
5,I like this soundtrack I also like the movie!,"There are usually a couple of songs on a soundtract, but all the songs on this one are good. So I would recommend everyone to buy and watch the movie."
4,Excellent blend of heart-warming and touching songs.,"After seeing the movie, I had to run out and get this cd, very moving and inspiring, Garth Brooks is a fantastic singer with a brilliant voice! ""To make you feel my love"" is a song that leads you to sing and feel the words inside your heart... I loved it!"
3,Think of this album as a reverse sandwich...,"...in this case, the meat on on the outside. ""To Make you Feel My Love"" is one of the best songs EVER written, and we are fortunate to have 2 entirely different verions on this CD. One by Garth Brooks and the other by the incredible Trisha Yearwood. Packaged in between these two pieces of filet mignon, however, is nothing but melodramatice white-bread music that is easily forgotten about once the CD stops playing."
3,where's the song from the trailer?,"I saw this movie about 3 or 4 years ago, i can't remember when exactly, but even before I saw it, I already bought the soundtrack. The reason why I bought it was because I saw the trailer for the movie and there was this great song playing in the background when Harry Connick was dancing with Sandra Bullock in a fair or something. Well, imagine my disappointment when I listened to the CD and my song was not included! So if there's anyone out there who remembers/knows that song from the trailer, a little help would be great!"
4,Very good relaxing CD,"I really enjoy this cd. I have not been one for country music; however, this cd takes very relaxing country music added with R&B to make a very nice combination. I would recommend this cd for those who have and have not seen the movie."
5,Best touching Soundtrack of the year,"With Dylan's lyric and Yearwood's voice, the 1st and 13rd song 'To make you feel my love' is definitely be the most touching song in 1998.It's the album you can share with someone you love in the midnight....."
5,"""Hope Floats"" Delivers!","The soundtrack to Hope Floats delivers all the emotion of the film, while appealing to a wide variety of audiences. Soundout performances from Garth Brooks and Bryan Adams set the tone, complimented by songs from a variety of newcomers and old timers (No disrespect intended, Mr. Jagger). The wealth of great songs and the blend of different music genres, makes this CD enjoyable for any fan of great music, making it a ""must-have"" item for any CD collection!"
4,Nice to listen to,"I like this cd because it was familiar to the movie, but I did wish it more of the dance music the movie had but it is a nice cd."
5,Great!,"I love this CD. It has a variet of music. My favorites are Chances Are, To Make You Feel My Love, and When You Love Someone. This is one of my favorite CD's."
5,Excellent Soundtrack,I don't usually buy soundtrack cds but after seeing the movie (which I loved) I checked it out and took a chance. I did not regret it. This cd is one of my favorites now and it is one of the cds that is just pure pleasure to listen to. My favorites appear to be the same as others - Chances Are and To make you feel my love.
4,"Not everything, but close enough","This is a great video to show to high schoool classes when covering the genetics. It covers many (but not all) of the problems that a scientist would incur while trying to bring a dinosaur to life via DNA. The three steps in the video include, finding dino-DNA, developing the embryo, and keeping the dinosaur alive (much harder a task than one might think!). More (and more in depth) information on the problems incured can be found in the book ""The Science of Jurassic Park and the Lost World or, How to Build a Dinosaur"" by Rob DeSalle, Ph.D. Many problems, from finding the DNA, identifying the species, filling in gaps (frog DNA? PLEASE!!!), finding the appropriate first egg, and much much more."
3,Simon & Halbig Dolls: The Artful Aspect,I was disappointed that more head mold numbers were not available. I will need to look elsewhere to continue my research.

1,The Worst of the Worse,"There are only 4 decent tracks on here. Everything else on here is watered-down garbage that everyone's been choking on for the past year. I wouldn't waste my money on this. These songs are played repetitiously on the radio anyway, so why not record or download."
2,Volume 21,"Instead of buying a CD with all different types of music, buy a CD with only one genre of music on it.You would be better off that waySay NO to the Now CDS series!"
2,NOW 22 cover is here!!!,The Now 22 cover is here on amazon. It looks blue water with multicolored surf boards with the red logo & yellow surrounding the red logo. Ain't it cool? I can't wait to see the NOW 23 cover!

2,I saw it!,I just saw the Now 64 cover from the UK. It looks similar to 22. I saw it on Nowmusicforums.com under the Now 63 forum under the Now 64 coming out July 24th topic. It looks beautiful.
1,Everything that is wrong with the music industry,"Do we really need these compilations? Every radio station in America plays these songs every hour, over and over and over again. Not to mention their endless display on MTV. The worst part is that these actually top the charts every time and go at least triple platinum, which just encourages the record companies to keep releasing these, driving artists who actually put passion and creativity into their music further and further into obscurity.So do yourself a favor and listen to a college radio station or any other non-commercial radio for your music, this is just the clearest example of big corporations telling you what to listen to and purchase.And if you must have these songs, just download them for free on a Peer to Peer, no need to pump more money into this big corporate scheme."
3,disappointing,"This is little more than a long listing of producers. Very little detail is furnished about regions or producers. As an indication of this book's user-unfriendlyness, there is not even an overall map of Spain showing the locations of the wine-producing regions. Rather, hand-drawn rough sketches of small portions of maps of small areas are presented without any clue of how they relate to one another. This is just one of several manifestations of extremely low general production values. The disappointing thing is that the author did seem to do his homework, and in many cases can identify the better producers in a region or the best offering from a producer even when this information is quite obscure. ..."
5,Quality product,This is a quality product. works great. not much else to say.I use it for my Solar projects to disconnect from the batteries.
3,Deborah Cox offers exciting taste of sophomore album,"A debut single of her forthcoming album, her latest single, ""Things Just Ain't The Same,"" offers a taste of her vocal power. Popularized early in dance clubs, this dance mix version by Hex Hector features a new sound for the young artist. Also, included is the dance radio mix from her gold, self-titled debut of ""Who Do U Love."" Look for her soon-to-be-released album later this summer on Arista."
1,Inadequate technical content,"Since the first author of this book offers graduate courses in mobile computing, and the table of contents looked good, I bought this book at great expense. (The price is quite outrageous for developing countries). I was shocked to find that the book has very little technical details on any of the topics covered. The book's seven chapters constitute only 135 pages, which also includes about 25 photos of various mobile devices! At best, this book provides a preliminary overview of the area."
1,ATTN: THIS IS A JOURNAL!!!,"THIS BOOK INCLUDES ONLY AN INTRODUCTION AND THEN BLANK PAGES. I was very disappointed because this book sounded like what I needed, but then turned out to be only a journal. I was really under the impression that this was a good book with valuable advice."
2,very basic - you can do better,"Very, very, very, very, very, very basic. Five minutes you got it. Nothing in depth."
2,Save your money!,"Got it, charged it, placed into my olympus evolt e-500. Started operating camera, learning all the new functions, MAYBE 20 mins of operation and camera signals ""dead battery"". The charger indicated green before I placed the battery into use. Spend the extra for a 1500mAh."
2,Not good for learning to draw,Way too fast for learning to draw. Like most of Chings stuff it lacks narrative and aims at getting you to think visually. However first timers need a bit of narrative hand holding so I would suggest something else. Might be good for a 2nd book to help reinforce concepts visually after you already have some base confidence in the drawing.
3,A drawing book,"When I read the title of this book I thought it will focus in the sketch as a tool for design....it's not.Pretty sketches and great hand drawing techniques. I strongly recommend this book to somebody who wants to learn how to sketch, but look for other books if you want to get to understand and/or learn about the sketch as an idea in design."
5,fun and interesting,"i purchased this book as required text for an upcoming class and got more than i bargained for...the book is informative, fascinating, and inspiring and i haven't been able to put it down...i am really looking forward to utilizing the book in the classroom setting to in order to explore some of the concepts presented, particularly those that are more elusive to grasp...because the book uses exercises to really cement in the main idea of each of its concepts, it is an invaluable learning tool...i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in developing a deeper understanding and appreciation of drawing and design."
3,Too techincal,"If you want to learn all there is to know about architectural and perspective drawing, this book by Ching is for you. However, if all you need is to figure out how to keep your drawings from looking ""wonky"" (technical term in the quilt world) then there are better books out there that are easier to read like ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" by Betty Edwards and ""Drawing the Landscape"" by Sullivan."
1,Blech,"I got this book to learn how to construct shades and shadows. After reading the glowing comments here, I have to wonder if they're all from the author's friends and family, or if I'm just the dumbest person on Amazon. I find this book difficult at best to follow. It's supposedly for beginners, but assumes the reader knows far more on the subject than he probably does.I finally did learn how to construct shades and shadows, but it wasn't with this book, it was with Rendall Yee's "" Architectural Drawing."""
5,Great Insight into Walt and the Company,"I've read many books about Walt Disney. What I loved about this one is that the stories come from the people Walt worked with every day. Some of them even go so far back as Kansas City. Some of the interviews go deeper into the production of many of the films, especially the early ones."
5,amazing,"If you have any interest in the Disney company's/animation history, this is the book for you. The whole thing was some of the most entertaining reading I've had in a while. Amazing never-before-published interviews with artists, the poster boys who have done a million of them, and also the artists who you never see in any of the Hyperion books. I know that to purchase the whole series is a hefty investment, but it will be worth it. I have found myself re-reading the interviews for inspiration. Looking forward to buying more volumes in the future."
1,Robbery,"Great Book but it is a paperback pamphlet, 65 pages and generally sell for less than $10.00. $50+ is a joke but not funny."
3,"Muisc 5 Stars, Dorati/London, 3 Stars","If the yr was 1961 up to the time of Boulez's recordings, i'd give Dorati and The London 5 Stars. But in 2008 I only can allow 3 stars. The music gets a stunning 5 Stars.In its day this was a fine first recording. Think about 1961, most people were hardly aware of the second viennese greats.We thank Dorati and the london for bringing a good recording in 1961, 1962.but times move on and along comes Boulez.This one is not recommended. Buy any of Boulez recordings."
5,"A heartwarming, heartbreaking Irish immigrant tale","Haggerty's Curse by Marsha Lytle is the heartwarming, heartbreaking and intriguing tale of Irish immigrants who journey to America in search of freedom and happiness. Along the way they suffer, as all families do, from lost loves, found loves, mistakes and secrets that weave the fabric of life. The raw, genuine, ordinary, exceptional and imperfect characters construct the framework of all families. It is this intimacy with family that resonates most with Haggerty's Curse. Their remarkable lives inspire a captivating saga of the Irish in America."
2,"Nice knife, but falls short of ""Classic"" Quality","I got this knife as a ""Gold Box"" item. I expected it would be the same well designed full tanged knife as the rest of my Wusthof ""Classic"" knives (I have 8). It is not, and it doesn't have the same balance and heft that I've learned to expect from the Classic line. None the less this is a good bread knife, I'm am concerned about how long it will hold an edge however. I do prefer my 9"" Classic bread knife. On the upside I find I cut bread more evenly with the offset handle."
2,"Not really a full tang knife, as described","This knife has a great serrated blade, but I chose it because it was described as a full tang knife (metal of blade extends all the way to the end of the handle, giving it more weight, sturdiness and leverage) and it turns out that it's clearly not--only 3/4 tang. Since one would expect to pay more for full-tang knife construction and feel, the description makes it sound like the knife is a better value than it really is.Wusthof Gourmet 7-Inch Offset Handle Bread/Deli Knife"
4,good and iron,O.k this is not the best toy in the world but the price and you get two comics in one so its very well worth itso keep up the good work
1,NEVER RECIEVED,"I purchased this item on November 13th and I am writing this review Dec 19th having still not recieved the item. I have written countless emails, to amazon and the seller personally with no respond. So on a rating from, 1-10 I would say my experiance with this seller and amazon are a 0...."
2,disapointed,"I got this expecting a good chunk of poetry translated but sadly it contained only a few of abu ala's poetry, which was ok translated, but the writer wanders off in the second book into some parts from the subject and makes a few errors which shows ignorance of political and social background in some period he discussed.Again like many oriental writing of that time the frequent prejudiced swipe are in plain view.If the writer had stuck to Abo alAla'a poetry only and not delved into unrelated issues he knows very little about, It would've been much better."
1,Not very pleased at all,"Quality of coin purse was ok. However, when I originally ordered mine, the website said there were five (5) to the pack.When I received my shipment, there was only one(1). I looked in the bottom of the box, and the original plastic packaging the five (5) coin purses came in was there, opened and empty.I contacted Amazon and they had me contact the vendor. The vendor did everything to say it wasn't their fault and even said they don't know how the plastic packing for the five (5) purses ended up in my shipping box.Needless to say, I'm not about to purchase any more ""lucky"" coin purses again from this dealer. I'm ""Lucky"" I wasn't stiffed any further."
3,coin holder,The picture showed a red coin holder and it came in bright orange. Not a huge deal but it was for a guy. It also was a little on the cheap side but still functioned =)
3,Unclear color detail,"This is exactly what I wanted as part of a Christmas gift for my father, but when I ordered it the color listed was black. What I received was blaze orange. Not exactly the subtle father-gift I'd hoped for."
5,makes cents,So glad I could find this item on Amazon.com - it's hard for me to find in stores. Item works just as it has in the past.
2,"too small,can not hold much coin","not very convinent!very small,can not hold much coin ,not fit for me !i dont like it !maybe i need buy a better one though more expencive than it!"
5,Old School!!!,Hard to find!! Exactly like the ones we had when we were a kid!! Finally found another to replace the lost one!
2,Disappointment quickly set in!,"I really think this book left something to be desired. The pictures were good, but are the only part that are credited to the source. The text seems to be hear say and reads like a magazine article; I don't think the author has ever even had a conversation with Bjork. I could not find one credit or source listed in the book, other than the pictures. The pictures are not captioned as to where or when they were taken. I was just really disappointed. I wouldn't waste my money..Again. Maybe I am wrong, check it out for yourself."
1,"Awkward Plot, Unbelievable Characters","I'm ready to forgive a lot for a good legal mystery, but I can't forgive enough to enjoy this book. The characters are two dimensional. The pace is awkward going from hour by hour and then jumping six months and then to day by day. The whole complicated political plot is recounted by someone who seem to know nothing about politics or law."
2,Totally not believable Plot!,"I don't want to give away the ""MOTIVE"" for the killing, but it is totally not believable. I am very disappointed!"
3,MAKE YOURSELF A SCORECARD/ List of Characters,"The number of characters introduced in the first two chapters numbers around 20! Way too many to learn about! I had to make myself a listing so I could keep track of who is who just to get into the book. There's a fire at the Painted Ladies, those colorful Victorian homes in San Francisco that have become an icon for the city on the bay. Police, firemen, and just regular people are introduced at the fire, then we move into the political arena District Attorney's office, Mayor, etc. very, very quickly. Sort of confusing but hang in there."
5,Lescroart Does It Again!,"Some authors seem to run out of energy when writing series books with the same characters, but not John Lescroart. Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitsky are back in another engrossing story. This book does not concentrate wholly on Dismas, and we learn more of Abe and his family. Don't worry, there is a murder case in which both are involved, among others. The Hardy/Glitsky books are not templates of each other; each has its own personality and The Motive is right up there with the best!"
1,Pieces don't fit.,"I liked the beginning and I was initially intrigued, but things went downhill fast starting with the introduction of the police character Cuneo - a stereotypical egotist, male chauvinist, lazy, and not too bright cop. The story leads the reader from one boring scenario to the next and then into a long drawn out trial which is like a rehash of what preceded. Finally, in the end you learn of what might have taken place, but it's so out of the blue that you're left feeling led on. I doubt I'll read any more by this author."
4,Entertaining and engrossing,"I loved the story, however I felt there were too many different plot lines. I would have liked to have the ""Beck"" story line more complete, along with Hardy's other relationships."
5,must read all of his books,"i happen to listen to the 12th book of the series first by accident. i went back and now am on number 5. you need to hear them in order. i love the references to prior books. when i get to 12 again, i may listen just to catch the references i didnt catch the first time around..."
3,Politics and Murder Go Hand In Hand.,"This book is a splendid mix of murder and politics and an involved account of the investigation in San Francisco of a double homicide at the ""Painted Ladies"" in the City by the Bay. Paul Hanover and his friend, Missy D'Amiens, are discovered with fatal gunshot wounds, which rules out suicide as the murder is almost covered up with the arson in the Victorian home.Catherine Hanover is in jail for a crime she did not commit, and yet she has no alibi. The courtroom drama plays out in detail with a surprise ending. This is Lescroart's sixteenth novel. About fifteen years ago, he suffered through a bout of spinal meningitis, and started writing full time. He also wrote WRITING THE POPULAR NOVEL. Others included THE FIRST LAW, THE OATH, and THE HEARING."
4,REad Tucker Anderson's Review,Tucker Anderson's review of this book describes the issues well. Without reading other books in the series a portion of the book is lost because the incident that colored the behavior of Dis and Abe is not understandable. For this effort to be completely enjoyed the past history should be understood.Having said that most of this is a good read. I do not want to give away too much of the plot but the twists and turns before the ending are fascinating. We watch the story unfold through deductive reasoning. Dis is a compelling character who shows human weaknesses.There are a few quibbles. It is hard to understand how the illness of Abe's son fits in the story. Also I think the ending was a bit far fetched.
2,Olive oil for haute cuisine,"A very small amount of what is obviously a high-end extra virgin olive oil. Used it quite sparingly for a definite unique flavor. As the old ad goes, ""a little dab'll do you.""Always wanted to try highest quality virgin olive oil. Now i have. Not for those on a budget, and there are some other ""true"" virgin olive oils available at more reasonable cost. Best for those with a champagne budget as well as champaign taste."
3,Encouragement for Young Artists,"This is a very encouraging book for budding young artists. The illustrations are very nice and the story of Georgia O'Keefe's life is presented in an interesting way. I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my 10-year-old niece, but after reading it I decided to give it to my 7-year-old niece instead. I think the reading level and presentation are more suitable for younger children. A bright 10-year-old would wonder why I gave her ""a baby book."""
3,Good but be aware,"Good songs, good price but be aware if you're looking for When your heart is weak Dance Mix look somewhere else because this the same version that appears in every compilation of various artists and hits collections of Cock Robin.I don't know why they keep doing this (Sony, Bmg, I don't know who), I think is like punishment to the people that still wants to buy legally music and not to download from internet for free, I think this is what they really want because after attempts to install software in most of the CD's sold by Sony and failed protecting his content they don't know anymore what to do."
5,beauties!!,"This is a truly amazing piece of work...very appealing to the eye and interesting to the mind. The choice of subjects is quite thought provoking and they are posed just unconventionally enough to keep the interest level high through-out.A ""coffee table"" book that raises the traditional standard of the genre."
5,expensive but excellent,"This CD is awesome! Even though its pretty expensive, the tracks on this CD are excellent. ONE is one of Metallica's best tracks, and its followed up by one of their best cover tracks. And the live versions of For Whom the Bell Tolls and Sanitarium are great. The demo version of ONE is also cool, even though it was recorded on a 4-track player, so there's no bass, but its kind of neat to listen to the demo version first, and then listen to the studio version of ONE. Overall, this CD is kind of expensive, but if you're a real Metallica fan, highly recommended."
4,"This song is definetly number ""One""","One as the title really says it all. its the one song that brings out the disgusting reality of war. Kirk's solo on this song is ""one"" of the fastest ive ever heard and is definetly in the top 10 of all time. For those of you that dont know the song is taken from a movie about a man in a war that steps on a landmine and loses not only his arms and his legs but his sight hearing and speach as well. Hence ""Landmine has taken my sight, taken my speach.... Overall this war-time ""novelty"" is one of the hardest yet most meaningful songs you will ever hear"
5,Perfect!!!!,"Ya gotta love this song!!!! It's got it's soft, mellow movie-like feel at the beginning of the song, and the ending half ives you that metallica feeling that everyone knows and loves. Fans of both alternative rock and metal have loved this song...cuz guess what? IT KICKS ALL TYPES OF A**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The single one,On the oringal cd named one by metallica it only had 3 songs on it so who ever is saying it had breadfan on it is so wrong breadfan was on a tape called harvester of sorrow the cd called one only had one a live version of welcome home saniturm and a live version of for whom the bells toll.
5,Great Accessory for Any Vehicle,"We purchased the Case Logic Portable DVD Player Case, Model APDV-3, for use on a recent road trip with two young children. It worked very well; easy to hang from front seats, would fit any size portable CD player and has storage for CD's. However, the best thing is probably the adaptor for two headsets. No fighting over who got to listen."
2,Not that useful,I used it for some time. After that I gave the DVD player to my son to keep it on his lap.Somehow I did not like it. Because it was hard to insert the wires. Not able to adjust the viewing angle.
3,Portable DVD player case,DVD player fits well into the case and movie is set up well in the car. Should be collapsible when not in use and still suspended in the car.
1,Didn't work,Case would not work on our car - headrests not shaped right for the straps to hold it upright...it would tilt down when the straps where fit to the headrest. We have a Ford Escape (2005). Tired of the frustration and gave it away.
2,A pain.,"I returned this because it was such a pain to try to use. Just trying to get all the straps the right tension, was a pain enough. But then it didn't hold the player up and level like you would expect it to. No matter how much my husband and I fiddled with it, the straps and all, we finally gave up. We got a different one that, mounts on the back of the car headrests, and that works great."
3,Just ok,"I had purchased a Sony DVD portable player and needed a case. (It was very disappointing that most portable players don't come with a case - my first one did!). The screen is 8"". Once I added earphones and packed the cables and remote that came with the player, the bag is stuffed and often hard to close. It's better to leave out something to have the room but that defeats the purpose of having everything with you to use in a car or inside any place. The case is nicely made but I think it needs to be a little larger to hold everything that comes with a portable player and any earphones you may want to add."
5,very good case!,"My 7"" coby dvd player fits perfect! I love it and its good size. It doesn't look big its perfect."
1,Get a wheelbarrow instead!,"We have one of these for hauling yard stuff back and forth on a long uneven lawn, and every time it tips over I curse it for how unstable it is. The designers had the challenge, ""how can we make this more unstable than a wheelbarrow?"" Their solution was first, use wheels that are too small and second, put them right under the load instead out in front of it.If you have one of these, it's better to pull rather than push it and it won't tip over as often. But the best scenario is to buy a wheelbarrow instead."
4,Ames Garden Cart,Very few small garden carts on the market. This item fills the bill for just such an item. Light weight and easy for use by older people.
1,Be kind to yourself - get something wider and with real wheels,This thing will tip over with anything more than air in it. The wheels are too close together and too small.
1,Confusing,"The poems in here are original but the originality defeats any pleasure derived from reading spaces and dots. I can understand how poems are moving more towards the artistic aspect of literature/art but poems should also be firmly rooted on word choice, connotations, connection to the reader, etc. This piece felt alien."
2,BIG Disappointment,"I would generally not take the time for write a review. But as a longtime fan of KRUPS products, I have to say that the FME1-11 Coffeemaker is a huge disappointment.The appliance has only been in my kitchen three days, and already the water-level-indicator on the front left side is malfunctioning.It won't be much fun using a measuring cup each morning to establish the right amount of water ....KRUPS should be making a windfall on this unit as it appears to be nothing more than a cheap piece of molded plastic and a thin glass pot. Not even that attractive when it's in front of you.KEEP LOOKING, there have to be better units out there.EAS/Chicago"
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah!!!!!","Blah times a hundred!! What has happened to Johanna Lindsey's writing. I swear she has forgotten how to create sexy over-the-top romances that keep you turning the pages. I almost gave up on this one, but being a true Lindsey fan I couldn't. Don't waste your money like I did by buying it new. If you feel you just have to read it(like I did), then wait for someone to put it on sell for $.01. I hope the next one is more of Lindey's usual style because it involves everyone's beloved Malorys. Can't wait."
3,Lindsey,I am a favorite of LIndsey but this book has not met my expectations. It needs more excitement very typical.
3,marriage most scandalous,this one was a bit different than her usual style. i thoroughly enjoyed the story. a great black sheep love story
2,Wait for the next Malory novel,The only Johanna Lindsey novels worse than this are the futuristic novels she wrote (forgot the titles). It took me about a month (normally 1 or 2 days) to complete this one.
2,This one is not a keeper,"I wont go on and on about what the plots were in this book. To keep this short and simple, this book was only mildly entertaining. And I wouldn't even call it a romance. There wasn't even any ""spark"" between Maggie and Sebastian for me. By the time they did declare their love for each other I thought ""you got to be kidding!"" It was THAT unbelievable.Save your money and if you really want to read this book, get it used or borrow it from the library."
1,Never again...,"Never again will I buy another Lindsey!!! ""A Marriage Most Scandalous"" was such a disappointment, I threw it in the trash just to save some unexpecting poor soul at a yard sale from wasting 50 cents! I (barely) finished it a week ago and can barely remember it (thankfully). Dull, overly complex, and silly plot line. Didn't like the last Lindsey I read either (can't remember the title - probably a good thing). Very disappointing...I'll stick with my new favorite authors: Quinn, Kleypas, Balogh, etc."
2,what happen to my fav author,"Johanna Lindsey's book are not what they used to be. I have read every one, does she have a ghost writter. the Malory books are the worst. I will not be buying too many more of Johanna Lindsey's books."
1,Zero stars -- don't waste your money,"I enjoy romance novels, and understand that their plots can be somewhat farfetched at times, but this was ridiculous. The final climax and revelations of her idiotically convoluted plot were as unrewarding as they were cynical in their ridicule of the gullibility of the reader. This plot was not Swiss cheese -- it was so full of holes it could double as a fish net. Certainly not sufficient reward for plowing through almost 400 pages, only a few enjoyable moments to the good. And the Publisher's Weekly review above was right that ""the protagonists are really modern characters in Regency guise."" The tone went beyond 'tongue-in-cheek' to cynical. This was my first Lindsey novel, and it will certainly be my last."
2,Not normal Lindsey!!,"This book was not what Johanna Lindsey normaly writes!! I have all of her books and this was the worst one I have ever read. It was very boring, I can read a good book in under 2 days, this one took me a week to finish. There were many typos, and I never really saw the romance part of it?? This is one book I'll never read twice! If you want a good book to read of Ms. Lindsey, get the Malory series! They are awesome books!!"
3,Just OKAY,"This book has soooo many subplots that get tied up nicely in a bow at the end that I wanted to scream. I liked Maggie and Sebastion, although the story could have been written so much better. I didn't get the usual feelings that I do when I read a good book, like that I ""knew"" the characters. Probably because there was so much going on in the book, that Ms. Lindsey didn't spend the time to make her characters ""real"". If you want to read this book, check it out at the library and save your money."
2,"Disappointing, to say the least","Lindsey was one of my favorite authors when I first started reading romance novels, but this one falls short. Even if you can get past all the implausibility of the plot (what romance novel doesn't have those) and accept the situation as is, there's still the incredibly trite, cheesy, cliché `Raven' moniker to deal with. And we hear it over and over and over.And with the exception of the grandmother, none of the characters are remotely interesting. The mystery portion of the story fizzles out with a most unsatisfactory explanation, and the rest of it is just plain dull. It's the sort of book that, the day after you finish it, you can't remember a single thing about.There are tons of better romance novels out there, including many by Lindsey. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, go read one worth your time."
2,Where is the REAL Johanna Lindsey?,"I too adored Johanna's earlier books and I was willing to forgive much, but this latest offering left me cold. With cardboard characters, anachronistic and stilted dialogue, a sketchy and improbable plot, it, and several books before it, must have been written by someone else! I was annoyed by the overuse of ""bloody"", on every page at least, perhaps to increase the word count? Save your money"
3,Underwhelming,"I saw this hardback book in a bookstore and I wrote the title down so I could find it in a library. It was constantly checked out so I had to finally place a hold on it. I was excited. I really enjoy Johanna Lindsey.The first 100 pages are good. I enjoyed that portion of the story. The middle was the big problem. It slowed down and became so boring. The sexy proposal Sebastian makes to Margaret just sort of fizzles. The end finished abruptly and issues really aren't resolved, they just sort of go away.I put three stars on this, but I really think it is more like 2 1/2. It isn't terrible, but it could have been so much better."
4,Really Good read -- until the last 2 chapters,"I enjoyed reading ""A Loving Scoundrel"" so much that I decided to see what else Lindsey had written. I found this book a fun read although if you are looking for sensual fire -- try Julia Quinn. Sebastian is a fun two sided hero (Sebby as his Grandma calls him & The Raven, mercenary for hire) Our Heroine, Margaret (Maggie) has loved Sebby since she was 11 & caught him kissing one of her sister's friends. But that was before the duel...now, Sebastian is disowned and he makes his living taking care of problems for other people. I loved the dialog between Seb & Maggie & enjoyed the book UNTIL she wrapped up the mystery...it's kinda far fetched but it does make for a ""And they lived happily ever after"" finale."
2,Too apathetic to be disappointed.,"I have loved reading Johanna Lindsey books for a long, long while. I was excited to get this book. That was a short lived emotion. Overall it is OK. It isn't cringe worthy. I guess my problem with it is that it lacks the typical hook of most Lindsey books, regardless of how formulaic they can be. In reading this story I found that I just didn't care. At this point, I'm not even sure I remember the entire plot... you can see how vibrant the images were! not! If you love Lindsey, grab a copy from the library... live through the disapointment of this lackluster book and spend your money on something that will keep you awake, like a good cup of coffee."
3,Needs Some Clean Up,"This was my first Johanna Lindsey book, but will not be my last.I really enjoyed the book and read through it very quickly. My only criticism is the end felt a bit rushed, like the author was facing a deadline, and there were some loose ends that weren't really dealt with.The loose ends were minor story threads, but if you read the book you know what I'm talking about.I also thought I'd be a little more upset with Sebastian over what he did and some more words should have been shared between them.Overall a very good read, but could use an ending clean up.But...I will buy more of her books."
1,Ugh,"This book was so disappointing--I've read almost all of Johanna Lindsey's books, and I was so looking forward to this one. I completely agree with the first two reviewers--there were terrible characters, poor writing, and horrendous plot development--finally, it felt like she finally got bored and decided to wrap up the entire story in the last two chapters so she could finally put an end to it. It was so disappointing that I had to check the inside cover three times to make sure this was truly was a book Johanna Lindsey had written."
2,The story falls apart,"This book started out with some promise. I agree with the other reviewer, the hero and herione didn't seem to really like each other. It was more like it was time to interject the love scene.The loose ends were neatly tied up at the end with a disappointing payoff. There was no emotional build up at all.The unrealistic points such as Maggie living alone at 23 or her being a ward of a family friend didn't bother me as much as the way they tied up the end of the book."
3,Just fine,"A friend recommended this to me for cold days of working outside. I seems to be a nice base layer, and appears to wick moisture effetively. It is quite thin and I'm nervous any rough handling will tear it. I am not at all convinced that this is more effective than a regular, thicker long underewear top. I've had no issues over my first couple uses but I think I would go with standard long underwear next time."
2,Filament Crew,"When they say filament, they mean filament. These are just a bit too thin for me. If your looking for a silk like very thin base layer, then they are fine."
3,Terramar,"It's okay, however I do not recommend it. I found something much better and cheaper at Belks a few daysafter getting this."
2,thin and flimsy,"Very disappointed in this product. The shirt is thin enough to see through, more like a stocking than a shirt. Also pilling badly around the collar, though my husband has worn it only a couple months. He has similar apparel in other brands that he likes much better."
2,Men's Panythose Top,"Too thin. I wanted some lightweight winter undergarments for my husband, I was thinking cuddle-duds for men, but these are see-through. They really do look like black pantyhose when on. He hasn't worn them yet so I have no idea if they get the job done."
3,ultra thin,"You'll see the same, but more in-depth comments, on my review of the men's pants from the same company.This is ultra thin, stocking weight material. If you want something barely there and see through, this is good. If you want insulation, get Lands' End for Silk, or I highly recommend Icebreaker for wool.You will definitely need to wear something over this unless you want everyone to see your body. With the LE or Icebreaker stuff, you can lounge around the house in them and not run for the bedroom if unexpected company knocks at the door."
2,"""Thermasilk"" is a very broad term","Ok, the shirt is comfortable enough, but it is so thin that it adds less ""thermal"" insulation than a standard t-shirt/undershirt. Not a nice choice for the price."
2,Disappointment,This book lacks the details for someone who is looking to actually do the work themselves. As mentioned in one of the other reviews - this book is just a composite of magazine article. Typical of magazine articles - shallow with little substance.
2,no help,"I bought this without reading the reviews, it was a mistake. I am designing an addition and need a clear guide from forms to finishing. This isn't it. As meantioned, it is a collection of articles. While informative, there are major gaps in coverage and I am no more ready to design my foundation than before. There is more useful info on foundations in the framing books I purchased."
3,Where's the detail on using rebar in concrete?,This is one of two books I purchased with the expectation of finding some detail on rebar design for monolithic slabs. Both books fall short in writing or displaying even the most basic design for rebar in a slab (see my other review on a similar book on working with concrete). This book does a little better job in showing how to make and use concrete forms.
3,Only good for a basement foundation,"This book is really only good if you're doing a basement foundation. If you're doing a slab foundation on grade it's really not very useful. I was hoping for it to tell me step by step how to do the slab foundation for our addition but in Texas very few people have or build basements and that's all that it really talked about.There is still some useful information in here and it's a good book, just not comprehensive."
4,Great for people who like to do things right the first time,This is good for even advanced people as it gives little trade sercerts for stronger walls. Its a good book and a must if you are doing concrete work yourself.
4,THIS IS NOT JOHN WILLIAMS,"But still good, better as background music that you listen to while you drive or when your on the computer typing or whatever.Its kind of hard to just sit down and listen to it, like you can with John's music. Because most of the music is fast paced and short, which makes since because its for a video game. So don't expect wonderfull masterpieces that are amazing to listen to, songs that are as big and dramatic as John would do. But more of short simple songs that are still fun to listen to.May God BE ABLE to bless you....... JOHN 3:16............^^^^^.............."
1,No point buying this cd,"The songs feature in this cd can be found in the game cd as well, so there is no point buying this one."
3,Does not fit 2005 Hybrid...,"....according to the Beck Arnley catalog.The Clutch Kit Model 061-9519 does fit the hybrid, according to their catalog."
3,Early Nineties Semi-Good Stuff,"Pretty good rapper with a decent flow although this can't be the album he is known for, I'm gonna have to look that one up. All the beats and rhymes are half decent, the subject matter is exactly the same on every song though. I guess he's just livin up to his name though can't really fault him for that. If you like hardcore sex rhyme rap this is definitely gonna keep you happy."
4,What's wrong with wood?,"I have to disagree with Fiona Bessey-Bushnell about wood. It's wood, a perfectly safe natural material. Most cutting boards are made of wood and you don't see people complaining of the microbial nightmare while chopping food.Being from Northern Europe, I am always amazed at how many toys in the US are made of cheap plastics as opposed to that durable and great natural material: wood. Maybe I'm old fashioned by I think wood has more ""soul"" and is nicer to the touch.My nine month old daughter has plenty of wood toys and they spend most of their time on the floor. Most of them have been licked and sucked on at one point or another. This does not make her sick. Having an environment too clean may actually hinder the development of the immune system. That's one of the reasons why many doctors are skeptical about the current trend involving antibacterial soaps.Wood can be easily cleaned. Rinse and if necessary wipe with a disinfectant wipe."
1,DO NOT BUY Choking Hazard,"Do not buy this pacifier chain. We rcvd. as gift and was happy to have. However, my 7.5 month somehow pulled the knot, the only thing holding the beads on, and when we looked down he was covered in the wooden beads. Thank goodness he didn't swallow one...but it was close call. There is nothing to stop all the small beads to pull off once the knot is undone. A very dangerous product for infants/toddlers."
1,Very disappointing!,"I tired Dip 'N Grow on several different ""woods"" (soft, medium and hard), but had no luck growing any roots from fresh-cut branches, as per the claim. Each type of wood required a different solution, and was meticulously applied and tracked. The company does not back their claims, either. I was much better off taking some of the cuttings, such as the umbrellat tree, and germinating with Miracle Grow."
3,interesting,this is not only an interesting shape for a cross. it is beautiful in it's own way. well taken care of and made.
4,uryu cross necklace,what can i say other then this item is a great deal the only problem is the chain were you hook it in is a bit to small for my taste
3,"I appreciate it, so far.","It reads like a manual in some places where it gets a little boring, but of course you are not reading for entertainment, but this book is very informative and gives great examples that help you think about what you want to do also."
2,book,"I had to purchase this book for class, and it is very hard to followafter the class was required to purchase it the instructor decided that she didn't like the book. but the price just couldn't be better."
4,Be careful if you hike a lot,"I am planning on replacing my pair of these boots in a few weeks. I will buy the all leather option, though, this time. Although the boots are very comfortable, my pair is 4 years old, and where the fabric and leather join, has broken down in several areas. The fabric portion has failed. No more fabric for me, but I must say I am hiking in the mountains or working on the farm daily, and wear these boots several times per week. I own several more expensive brands, such as Keens, but none are more comfortable."
3,tongue is too big,"I had to return these Timbs Euro hiking boots. Please, try Timberland SkHigh Rock Hiker boots instead - better fit and style. They run little big for 10W. However, I tried 9.5W and they were too small. Maybe 10D (regular width) would work better."
1,mala compra,"el articulo llego defectuoso unas de las botas es distinta una tenia la punta de la bota mas gruesa que la otra y se ve que son distinta porque los cordones es uno mas largo que el otro, una estafa total y mi calificación seria cero"
4,Can't beat the price,Boots came eariler than expected! and were nice. I really love theses boots. Best of all my feet don't look big in theses boots.
3,Excelent product but please take care of the customer,"The product is excellent, the shipping time was perfect, but as an international customer I needed a receipt on the box for custom purposes. I was being overcharged for shipping just because of this issue. Please for future reference always, always put a receipt with the box. I would definitely buy from your company again but please place this as a very important suggestion."
2,Its ok,I am having any luck in buying shoes online. I will go back to buying from the shore where I can fit it on and see it on my foot. It looks good online but looks different when its on my foot. Its OK but I wouldn't have bought if I was in a store.
3,Philips Skype Voip cordless phone,"Well, it works, but perfect it aint.1 - The display screen seems of a previous generation - shows about 10 characters, so difficult to read contacts' names. Totally out of date compared with current mobile phone displays.2 - Very fragile - dropping the handset on the floor caused irreparable damage, and no spares - ony solution was to buy a whole new set.3 - The whole idea was to use it with Skypeout to avoid the need for a fixed phone line - OK, but you can't dial out directly (could if used with phone line) - have to first enter the number as a Skype contact (note 1 above)."
4,Buy the Book and DVD,"The books is better at describing the methods and should be bought first, then the DVD is necessary to make sure you are doing it right. Don't skimp, buy them both, but get the book first!"
3,Pluses & minuses,"Pluses:-Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) rich colors are better than LCD-Nice physical design, looks good in the room as a piece of furniture-Good sound-Slim fit light-weight for a CRT, fits on smaller surfacesMinuses:--Picture is distorted.--Vertical lines are not vertical. They slant inward as you trace them along upward, then they slant suddently outward near the top. Very annoying to me, even though my wife doesn't seem to mind.--The very bottom is cut off. For example, when a TV station displays its logo in the bottom corner, you can't see the bottom of it. Not that I care about TV station logos, but I do care about films and I wonder if I am seeing the film as the director truly intended.Conclusion:The Samsung is doing its job, but I'll spend more for a SONY next time."
4,Great TV! Incredible Picture and Sound,We couldn't be happier with this our first HDTV. The picture is incredible but you do need to get the HDTV DVD player and the $100- moster cable for it all to work right.Very easy to use and set up. Did have a little trouble sorting out the aspect ratio on some older remastered films but no problem once we figured out the remote.Remote is fine but not great as a universal even with the Samsung DVD which we also got and love.The slim fit is a nice balance between the flat screen plasma price the and big ugly old boxes but this is a big TV to carry in though it has a small footprint in place.
1,Pure Junk DO NOT BUY,"If you only want a TV for a year, buy Samsung. Samsung will NOT back their product, and this problem of power and fuses seems to be common with Samsung and was even acknowledged but given the run around and the solution was finally I'M SORRY. DON'T BUY REGARDLESS OF ANY POSITIVE REVIEWS! Our TV lasted a whole 16 months."
1,Would not recommend,"I would not recommend the Samsung TX-R3079WH. I bought it 3.5 years ago and it was great. That is until 6 months ago when it began having all the problems the other reviews describe. (1) Power button went out, paid to get that repaired. (2) Picture became a little too wide for the screen, but viewable. (3) Picture is now completely distorted, like looking at an hour glass or fun house mirror and randomly turns itself off and on every few minutes. Authorized repairman says he cannot fix it. Samsung advises for me to send them paperwork from the repairman stating it cannot be fixed and they ""will see what they may do."" Hopefully they will do something as I expect a (quality) tv to last more than 3.5 years. We will see."
2,"TV nice, only lasted a year","I got this TV and it worked great for just over a year and then died. The warranty was for a year and they were not at all helpful to get it fixed. My Dad is an electrical engineer so he got the specs and opened the TV up and found it had a cracked circuit board inside that had happened from the factory. I am not sure if this was the actual problem or not but the TV is dead and after taking it to one TV repair shop, they told me it was going to cost more for them to trouble shoot and fix the problem than the TV is worth... I am not buying another Samsung, the customer service sucks."
2,Bad choice for an HDTV,"I got this 2 years ago when my old sony of 15 years went poof. At the time I did not have the money for a Plasma or LCD and thought this would be a good option. Well The HDTV pic was ok, better then my old sony. But lot of drawbacks. Line bending. Plus despite sheilded monitors the screen got purplish on the top right. Nice blacks however. Worst problem was the line bending. Destoryed teh HD image. Even the side bars for a 4:3 pic were bent. Once I noticed it it was all I could see. I replaced this TV after to years for a plasma. Now I really see that despite both being HDTV's the Plasma takes the cake."
2,"Great, when it works.","Bought this set less than a year ago, and have been happy with the picture quality and features. But, now it unexpectedly turns off a few minutes after it's turned on. Spoke with a salesperson at Best Buy about this set and he says that they aren't well made and often develop problems from poor components.This thing weighs 120+ lbs. and it is no easy task getting it somewhere for repair.I would certainly think twice before buying this, or any other Samsung product."
4,For the cost...why complain?,"I wanted a CRT and did not look beyond CRT's.I purchased the TV 3 months ago.I had 30 days to decide whether to keep it, or bring it back...I kept it!I love the HDTV picture, and the size for my small living room, and I did not have to purchase a new entertainment center...which I would of had to do if I bought a heavier, clunkier Sony.Paid $900.00can in Canada.Yes, there is some minor bowing at the bottom of the screen (I only notice it with my onscreen TV guide...otherwise I can live with it, and I never notice it when viewing TV programs).Yes, there is some distortion on the right side of the screen...again I RARELY notice this, and can live with it."
1,STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG TV's!!,"I've owned this piece of junk for not quite two years, and it has required servicing four times already. The picture has gone out, the sound cuts in and out intermittently, and now it won't even turn on - no power at all. Despite this history of problems, Samsung is unwilling to provide any service. Also, the last time I had this unit in for service, the repair shop technician had FOUR other SAMSUNG TV's that had just been brought in to his shop. You guessed it - they were ALL model TX-R3079WH. The tech told me that 80% of his business is from Samsung junk and a large portion of that work is from this crappy model. Do yourself a favor and keep looking, unless you're in the market for a 120 pound paperweight. STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG TV's!!!"
1,Bad Geometry/fuzziness,"Picked this one up, seemed as though most reviews I read online proposed a hit or miss situation. Ours was definitely a miss. Geometry was horrendous. Im not talking a very slight distortion, Im talking massive curving of straight lines along the bottom of the TV. On top of that, in every corner of the TV we had a fuzzy picture.Ended up buying a Sony HS420. Much heavier TV, but the picture is superb."
1,Garbage - warning do not buy this or other Samsung products,I purchased this tv new: Samsung SlimFit TV (model TX-R3079WH)a little after a year - of course just after the warranty expired it emits this loud high pitch noise that squeals so loud I have to turn off instead of getting a headache.I called Samsung and they were very polite but knew nothing about the TV or the problem and suggested I have someone come out and repair it.This 100+ pound monster is being tossed and I will never again buy Samsung products - ever.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV,"I brough this TV from BB about 2 years ago. Initially, I had no problems and the picture quality was awesome. But after a year of ownership it started to randomly cut itself off and on for no apparent reason. No help or assistance from Samsung. I unfortunately did not get the extended warranty. I always thought Samsung made good products but not anymore. This TV is only good for a year if your lucky. DO NOT BUY!!"
5,"Great TV, no problems","I got one of these at Sam's Club a little over a year ago and it has been awesome since day 1. I have had excellent picture, and no problems at all. I am a med student and always have a movie or something playing on it when I am studying, which is almost all the time."
2,Be Warned,"1. Audio output makes set up with home theater systems difficult. You'll need splitters.2. The remote control will not control Samsung's own DVD/VCR combo units such as the V3500.3. Telephone customer support is very lacking. Long hold times, poorly trained techs, and I was hung up on twice while being transferred.4. For some reason, the Source button on the remote does not cycle through the Component video inputs (only the coax, air and RCA inputs) so to switch between your HDTV cable box and DVD player that are both connected with Component cables, you have go three layers into the menu.Other than that, the looks great."
1,The worst crt that I ever seen!!!,"Recently I almost buy this tv, thanks to god I do not do it, but I have the opportunity of probe it completly and let me tell you this, the little piece of tube that samsung cuts behind is missing in its image, I plug an xbox with ypbpr cables and the results was a disaster, the center of screen very well but in the left and right edges the picture suffers distortion, I was trying to setup the picture configuration and it does not work, I wrote samsung telling them the problem and nobody cares I personally think that they do not care because they sells garbage, I was really sorry because the tv set looks good and was a good option to consider if you compares against a plasma tv prices..."
4,Great TV with the proper Configuration!!!,"All the reviews I read about it has been True, The Bowing at the bottom of the screen happens on HD when viewing a Ticker ex. CNN. On 4:3 Aspect ratio the corners of the sidebars bends so you dont get a well angled picture.BUT.... This TV is great for the price. I know I couldve got a much better LCD HDTV for maybe >$1000 but I am not ready to invest that much on a item I only use on the weekends. I wanted better picture for my DVD's I got it. I wanted a crisp, sharp, widescreen look for my video games, I got it. March Madness never looked better, I even watch the poor Knicks on HD and enjoy it, lol. Basically with some Monster Cables and the right wiring from your cable company or your antennas you should be fine. This is a High End TV for a great price. Enjoy!!!!"
2,poor picture quality,"Returned after 9 days because of right side distortion and poor rendering of horizontal and vertical lines. Its too bad, because the set has great looks, a good over-the-air HD tuner, intuitive on-screen menus, and excellent rendering of colors, contrast and brightness. Was impressed with the ability to pull in HD over-the-air broadcasts from local stations using a $10 set-top rabbit ear antenna. The on-screen signal strength meter is a great assist for finding the best antenna orientation. Am buying a sony kd-30sx955 instead, for about $250 more, based on brand reputation. If you opt for the Samsung, make sure you purchase from a store with a hassle-free return policy, just in case."
5,Not for old doors!,"These door knobs are well-made and look like good quality product, but they're made for NEW construction (and the listing states that they're for modern doors).I was very disappointed to see this. You'd think that someone manufacturing octagonal glass, colonial reproduction door knobs would want to help us poor souls who are trying to restore an old home to its original grandeur!This passage set requires drilling two sizable holes through the door. That's fine if you're working with a post-WW2 door, but in my old house, the old lock mechanism (the square boxy thing mortised into the door) prevents drilling those two holes *through* the door. I was able to use this knob on a more modern door in the house (that was recently replaced), but it's not usable on the home's original 1924 doors. Very, very disappointing."
5,The Way It Was--The 1940s/50s in the Service of our Country,"George Waple III is a charming story teller both in writing and in person. He tells of humble beginnings in Waple Mills, VA up to the present time. I found it fascinating that Waple worked with Patton prior to WWII and that he handled the ceremonial horses at the White House. You'll get a touch of what it was like to be that country boy gone soldiering around the world--World War II in the European Theater to Korea and Nam. He writes as he speaks--real country, real people"
3,A Great Story of a Soldiers Memoirs,"I found this book most enjoyable, personal, real-life, and a picture of soldiering not often portrayed. It's warm and humorous style carries the reader along the trails of his life with charm and flow, keeping one always engaged in the adventure of his career, and building admiration all the way through, from the spunky farm kid who was not put off by any adversity, but who made the most of all situations.I think the U.S. Army owes George Waple a vote of thanks.Mr. Waple is a terrific story teller."
5,Absolutely Indispensable!,"If you have a cat, you have to use this product. Nothing we have ever tried works better!"
5,Fantastic muffin pan,"This item is heavyweight, easy to hold with an oven mitt, with an excellent nonstick finish. Without question the best muffin/cupcake pan I've ever owned. I'm back to buy more!"
3,Partial shade,"This is a shelter with an attractive shape. It is strong; it flexes well with the wind. I am giving it three stars for a couple of reasons.One, when you open it up you read the instructions: ""Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun!"" Okay, I guess it is most appropriate for providing shade from the moon.Two, it doesn't provide that much shade. The sun shines right through. That was the first thing my family members mentioned. I ended up tying a heavy woven bedspread on top to get a decent amount of shade and temperature reduction.Also note you can't get the blue color anymore. It seems to only come in orange."
2,Way too many pieces,"Far too many poles and bits and pieces to set it up!Took the beach on first day, took it out of the box and realized it was going to take forever for 2 of us to set up. Had to pack it back up and return it."
5,My Favorite Mythology Book,"I got this when I was a kid from the Museam of Fine Art in Boston. But I still re-read it even today, for reference and fun. The life of the gods and the epic adventures of ancient greece are summed up nicely without being dumbed down. The illustrations are increadible too. A lot of thought was put into this book and it is just as well written. Highly recommended."
1,Wrong disc,"Instead of getting this disc I got instead a DGG CD where Abbado (no interest in) conducts the same work by Stravinsky plus many other works by the composer on the received wrong doubble-CD. What a shame and they could not correct the blunder because another buyer had instead received my ordered Mercury CD!Best regards,Björn WestbergSWEDEN"
4,"""I only want"" more of that group doing the Bar Background!!",You have to love Bab 5 for these background CD's - sort of like Star Trek incidental musicke. I just LOVE that 2 minute part with the female vocalist in the Bar Background Music (Track 3D)... Where could I find more info on her (and group)? Yeah!
5,Great Quality at a Great Price - Easy Install,"Ordered my escape ladder and had it in my house within 4 days. The ladder came with all the necessary hardware and was unbelievably easy to install. Unlike other ladders that you have to bolt together this ladder is already welded together in one strong piece. Just place the hooks over the top of your window well. If you want you can further secure the ladder to the well by screwing the bottom portion of the ladder to the well. After installing the ladder my family did a practice ""emergency drill"" and both my three year old son and two year old daughter were able to easily exit the window well up the sturdy ladder. Great product - Thank you."
5,terrific reference,"This monumental tome contains over 10,000 capsule biographies of notable figures in history, ranging from Menes (first Egyptian pharaoh), Descartes, Faraday, and Truman all the way to Tom Cruise and Michael Jordan. The entries are arranged alphabetically, and are accompanied by numerous photos, quotations, and recommended reading lists. Although necessarily brief (most are just a paragraph or two), the entries are well-written and cover the essentials. An appendix lists all the entries chronologically by year of birth. Other appendices list Nobel Prize winners, presidents, kings, etc. The book is beautifully laid out, and it can be fascinating just to browse through it. An amazing compilation, and truly a great value for $25 or so."
4,Right brain math,"This book is great! I got it for my 9 year old who loves math. He is def a ""math person,"" and this book is great for him. But, this book would be also be great for math-phobes or reluctant math students. This book moves beyond rote memorization or skills and into actual concepts, problem solving, and creative thinking. There is a lot of geometry. There is also a lot of art integration. I think that math-phobes would actually be tricked into thinking these activities were not math, and therefore enjoy and learn. Great addition to any library. I would recommend for ages 7 and up, but there are activities that teens and adults will enjoy. I bought the 1st addition because it had more pages."
3,Small book,"Just keep in mind that this is a smaller book, not a book that you can copy pages with activities for students to use."
4,Works as expected,I purchased this unit ($30) in the hopes to solve a couple of X10 problems that I didn't used to have. This unit was intended to replace the exact same model that I purchased in 2004. This new unit did not solve my issues. I firmly believe my 2004 unit was still working fine so I will keep this new one as a backup. But at least now I can troubleshoot as to if my older coupler is still working as it should when new issues arise. I should mention that since I purchased this device in 2004 it solved issues I was having of not always being able to get the X10 signals at a couple locations throughout my small home. I think my unresolved issues are due to the switches being 20 plus years old.
3,Hopeful for help,Some of my x-10 devices work with a timer and some don't. The standard cure is to get a phase coupler. It didn't work for me.
1,Was not happy,I never recieve my item they stated that my mail address was not correct.But that is the same address i have used each time i order items from your web site. I have request my money back and have not recieve a respones. If some one can contect me that would be great thank you.
2,Toy okay - just part of the Dora Castle,Not extemely impressed about this product - its was just something I bought to go with the Dora Castle. My daughter has probably had it in her hand a total of two times - she just doesn't find it interesting enough to play with.
4,Animaniacs - Vol. 4,"Hello Nurse! Like all the other reviewers I am glad that Warner Brothers finally released the last remaining episodes. Thank you! Everyone has their favorites and - Faboo - I love the 'Macadamia Nut' episode. A true musical classic! Seems hard to believe that the final Episode 99 came out in autumn 1998, almost 15 years ago! My ONLY disappointment, and a # 4 rating, is that there were no bonus features. How cool it would have been to include ""Wacko's Wish"" on the bonus disc as that was the true end to the series. It would have been a great bonus and a nice reward for us dedicated Animaniac fans who have been waiting these many years for Volume 4."
3,"not bad, good beat, pretty good lyrics",This isn't a bad Cd. I thought the lyrics would be better. I would still buy it!
2,truly disappointing,"After the wonderful Storming Heaven I was so excited to read this book, and then so disappointed. The plot is melodramatic, the characterizations cardboard."
4,pretty darn good,"I bought this CD after I bought my first Aphex twin cd (I care because you do) and i was much more impressed with this. Both seem to have common goals ( a melding of beauty and chaos) but I thought EP7 was much richer and complex. It seemed more sophisticated and pure. I wasn't totally blown away by this,so i dont think it deserves a full 5. but it's still totally worth buying and I would have rather given it 4.5 stars."
3,good but not their best,"did anyone hear of an artist releasing total trash, and then making the most beautiful music youll ever hear, well i would not put it past autechre, noone expected autechre to surpass tri repetae, but whos to say they will not, im just trying to say give the brothers a chance, sure ep7 was not the best, its a bit hard to listen too, but to the trained ear it is brilliant..."
1,near unlistenable,"This is what I call going off the deep end. I thought Amber is one of the best ambient albums I've heard. But to my ears, ep7 is just a dissonant collection of noise. Perhaps one can appreciate the somewhat inventive way they interpret noise as music, but that's nothing new. Aesthetically speaking, it's difficult to stomach."
3,cranium-stretching,"you either love autechre or hate them. their skittery, off balance, attention deficit disorder electronica is not for everyone; but for those with an open ear...a wonderous and weird world of sound awaits. if you consider aphex twin to be the jester of electronic music...then think of autechre as his overly intelligent free-jazz obsessed little brother.this isn't really much of an ep considering it has 11 songs on it, but there is plenty here to try and wrap your head around. the first track starts off innocently enough with a straight ahead (for autechre standards) beat and squelchy sound effects that resemble aphex twin's ""Richard D. James"" album. the second track threatens to go off the rails with it's relentless sampled voice, creepy distortion, and crumpled beats. it can get a little scary at times. but that's the beauty of this group. they have the ability to confuse the hell out of you.recommended for open minds."
2,Let's not be partial,"It is frustrating to me that fans of a given act will jump online and rate all of their respective albums highly. Where is the justice in only reading reviews coming from fans? EP7's reviews are this sort of scenario. I feel the album lacks the direction of Autechre's ""Amber"" and ""Tri R-"". This album is very difficult to listen to, as it stretches the drill and bass concept a bit too far. So then, I think it is only fitting that I rate EP7 low."
2,Wrong direction,"First of all why is the Nothing release missing the hidden stuff before track 1? Nine minutes, that like missing a whole track. Does Nothing think their fans are too dumb to realise it's even there? The album itself isn't any good, a friend and I agree that ""Ccec"" sounds like rap."
1,ugly noise by formerly talented musicians,"The emperor has no clothes.This phrase applies to nearly everything Warp has released in the last 2 years and, in particular, the lastest releases from Autechre. Where they previously created fascinating sonic textures with touches of emotion, they now create unlistenable experiments in noise that induce headaches rather than fascination. Do they own stock in an aspirin company or something?The dried up talent of Autechre is a sad but clear sign that the golden years of electronica are gone."
4,Folk music from a country of jazz-musician robots,"After the very electronic LP 5, Autechre here swerves back to and beyond the live, improvised, and somehow folky place they went on the wonderful Chiastic Slide. This takes it farther, to the point of often not seeming danceable at all. Not that anyone gets Autechre records for that anyway. Not easy listening, but rewarding and deep and catchy in the manner of good hard bop."
5,Greatest electronic album of all time,"Perhaps that is a grandiose statement, but no other album makes me feel like I'm seeing a glimpse into the future as much as ep7. And no other Autechre album personifies the statement 'music about architecture' than this one. Also, this album gets better and better with each listen. In my opinion, this album makes Confield sound like a sound effects cd. Present are both the eery yet familiar melodies and oddly timed beats of their more recognized work. But for me this 'ep' (oddly titled since it is a full length) is the overlooked gem of electronic music."
5,intempestive music,"If i have something to say about new ep-7, is just this simple word: intempestive. A music that prefer to stay in the border, in the ambiguity. Like living being moves toward places that anybody has arrived.It is the end of sweety armonies and obvious rythms, autechre declare the death to the techno movement at last, and they announce new languages that of course few listeners will accep. If you like techno please don.t buy this record, if you like poetry ep-7 will be the last day of your new day."
3,Worth checking out.,"I never got big into these guys, but I do have this disc-a collection of-for lack of a better term-electronic sounds and belches, bleeps, and bloops. In some ways reminds me of the retro Mini-moog type stuff, but without the added humor value. I would call this recording anti-septic in nature, but that does not mean it's boring. The more you listen the more you pick out the patterns in the 'chaos'. It's definitely worth a listen, but don't expect to understand it on a first listen. Intriguing."
4,The Wise Man in the Checkered Shirt,This book was very enjoyable to read. It was entertaining and had a good message. I would recommend it.
5,Hasn't left my turntable!!!!,"From the slick drama/sci-fi UPN series of the same name about an ex-army ranger police officer who develops heightened senses when his mission is shot down in the jungles of Peru, this CD combines slick original rock melodies, hauntingly gentle instrumentals and a primal jungle sound.It honestly hasn't left my turntable since the day I bought it. It is a wonderfully diverse assortment. One of the best ambiant soundtrack albums of its kind.I heartily recommend the CD, and the series itself, to anyone who likes to let their imagination run wild."
2,kinda crappy,this leaks...accuracy is horrible even with .2malfunctionslist of common malfunctions (I HAD TO RETURN THIS GUN 3 TIMES)first stage of trigger does not work. you must pull back hammermagazine...must take out each time and put back in to fire a roundAll around crappy DO NOT BUY THIS!
3,for collectors only,"This cd is really for blur collectors only. The versions featured here are not the best you'll findThe live version of Me, White Noise is lacking, relative to the album version... but you can make out the lyrics better. Out of Time is such a great song that it's good to hear a stripped down version here. Don't Be and the demo idea of Sweet Song give some impression as to what an unfinished product might sound like from Blur.All in all, nothing spectacular... interesting for the crazed fan... probably not exciting to the rest."
3,how is your math?,"Am building inductors for a loudspeaker crossover and wanted to know a bit more about the theory.This is probably a great boook for a university student ,who is at least a couple of years into electronic engineering .If you want to know about how they react to each other and your math is up to snuff this is probably the book on inductors ,Congratulations to those who understand itJanK"
3,Inductance Calculations by Grover-Review,"This old book (originally written in the '40s), is considered the bible of inductance calculations. For the modern user, however, it lacks many critical topics; for example spiral inductors (which is used extensively in integrated and planar modern circuits.) Also missing is calculations of inductor quality factor. Due to unavailibility of electronic computing at the time of publication, the book has many look-up tables. These tables are sometimes overly precise, for example, there is an extensive look-up table where essentially all numbers are between 0.99 and 1!. In engineering computations this type of accuracy is irrelevant, since other errors are more important. In the same computation the thickness of wires that make up the coil is not considered as a parameter, which is much bigger of an error than pendantic repetition of 0.9997 and 0.9998."
3,Horror Classics Vol. 10 - ID#14319,"Four movies on one discHorror Classics Vol. 10 - Platinum Disc ID#14319#1: King of the Zombies - 1941 - Director: Jean Yarbrough#2: The Monster Maker - 1944 - Director: Sam Newfield#3: Lady Frankenstein - 1971 - Director: Ernst R. Von Theumer#4: Sisters of Death - 1976 - Director: Joseph MazzucaAll in all; decent picture, decent sound. Nothing special, but menus all seem to work and thats rare for cheap compilation DVD's.These movies are available individually from amazon, so you can see actual reviews and movie details if you search for the title under DVD's."
2,OF A PIECE WITH MOST EDDIE ROMERO FILMS.,"A question might be posed concerning the title of this Philippine film as to who the ravagers might be, since its storyline during the WWII setting in and about a convent commandeered by Japanese troops and subsequently attacked by an American (John Derek) led local guerrilla force, reveals that only the latter group includes sexual as well as military aggression in its style. Director Eddie Romero patently believes that use of dialogue adds little to a movie's sense of purpose and as with a great deal of his work, this effort is composed essentially of long scenes of various combinations of men shooting at each other, but with such as the wooden Derek and the rather untalented Bronwyn Fitzsimons as leading players, it is perhaps an advantage to let the guns do the talking."
3,Too long,"This book went on too long. Christine should have been able to see what a catch Gavin was and not prolonged our agony. I felt she held out too long, went on about her ""calling"", and didn't see the prize she had in front of her. If these two had talked a little, things could have been settled much quicker. All in all, Gavin was one of the yummiest heroes I've read in a while. Too bad it took his wife so long to figure it out."
2,Good talent...but a letdown,"Well, I have to say...this live collection is a disappointment. Who picked which songs to put on these 2 discs? Joan Osborne is the only one who sounds great - she always sounds great live though. ""Ladder"" isn't one my more favorite Joan songs, but she did a fab. version. The rest of the songs just don't match the same live energy..."
3,Could have been better,"I when heard this cd the first time I thought it was horrible. The music didn't flow right. (I gues were arranged in the order by which they say sang, which would help the listen visualize being there but)... When I analized the music ""seperately"" it really didn't seem as bad. But the songs went from slow and soft to loud ""rock"" (give me a break)! In short: I felt the music was thrown together and because of that it was impersonal, and annoying."
2,Disappointing....,"As much as I respect these artists and their amazing collective talents, I have to force myself to listen to this CD. Since it was pricey, I REALLY wanted to be charmed and entertained...but everytime I play it, I am disappointed all over again."
1,A Melange of Mediocrity,Please don't tell me that this disappointing collection of lukewarm drivel represents the best and brightest of the upcoming female singer/songwriter collective. It's enough to drive one to drink...or worse...
5,An Excellent Performance by all of the Lilith Fair Women!,"I thought this CD really gave a lot of hope to young women all over the world. Not only does this celebration show great artists like Sarah Maclachan, Paula Cole, and Lisa Loeb, but it also introduces us to new artists that are just as good as anyone else. That's why I think that this CD is one of the best you can get. Some of the songs have helped me to understand my life a lot better. And this year, Sarah Maclachan has invited new and equally wonderful talent to join the show. These include Erykah Badu, Missy Elliot, and many more. Lilith Fair is really a celebration of women who deserve to speak their mind. The women are from all different cultures that come together to show the world that women are equal with men. And this CD really portrays that."
3,"Some great tracks, but disappointing overall","I bought this after hearing great reports about the Lilith Fair. This CD, however, does not match up with those reports. CD #1 is blah until Susanna Hoff's ""Eternal Flame"" and Sarah McLachlan's ""Building a Mystery"". CD #2 is an improvement, beginning with the outstanding ""Water is Wide"". The rest of CD #2 pales in comparison, though. If you have access to online music source, just download those 3 tracks and forget the rest."
1,Only one good song:,"I love the album ""jagged little pill"". When I heard the song ""Thank you"", I couldn't buy the album quick enough. I was so disappointed! The rest of the album was just awful."
5,Finally...,"My only criticism of this book is that it wasn't released sooner. Security for VB.NET covers what should already have been part of the VS.NET help or MSDN online library. I *love* the chapters on role-based and code-access security, which actually explains how you would use this stuff in real life. But my favorite chapter is the one on locking down Windows, IIS and .NET - this is exactly what I was looking for, a simple, unambiguous checklist for how to secure the platform."
2,Little more than basic security information,I purchased the book in order to get some depth on the inner workings of code access security and version management as it pertains to strongly named assemblies. In neither case did the book offer anything more than a rehash of the documentation -- and not in a particularly well thought out or organized manor.
4,if you are a fan buy it,"If you are a fan of this TV serie, you have to buy it for only one reason, it has every song that you heard it in the Tv, but if you only saw the series only a few time don't think about it, buy OTHER cd"
4,DB5251,"These speakers are extremely clear. I am running these with an amp pushing 45 watts RMS per channel. They have a nice mid bass for a 5.25 speaker. The highs are high(crossover set to 0 gain, at +3 it to high). Well worth the money I paid for them on amazon."
3,Not as expected.,The liner did not fit as snug as I had expected or had seen in other vehicles. Especially the drivers side.
4,Great for the beginning hobbyist,"This book is nicely devided into sections pertaining the different fish families. Information is given on general husbandry, feeding and also breeding. It covers the most commonly available fishes. Another nice feature for the beginning hobbyist of this book is (IMHO) the fact that it consistently gives you the scientific name followed by the common name. The informative text is lined with nice pictures. I can recommend this book to anyone who is starting out in the hobby. For the more advanced hobbyist it is a ""nice thing to have"" (if you are like me are always expanding your fish library :-)) but does not add much to the information you probably already have in other publications. The main reason I bought it is because it is the first publication I found that contained a picture of Hypancistrus zebra eventhough the information about this fish is minimal at best and didn't teach me anything I didn't already know."
3,Mish-Mash,"Of course I love all of Kate Chopin's work, but this collection overlaps with both Bayou Folk and A Night in Acadie (which one can purchase from Penguin Classics in a complete volume). The only real treasure in this book is a story that may be tricky to find: The Dream of an Hour. The title story is no great shakes. I would recommend buying her more comprehensive collections of stories and using this booklet (9 stories) as a filler for a few missing works. At 80 cents, who can loose?"
3,IT LOOKS PRETTY,So after buying this nice little kit I started pricing individual items in it on amazon and you can put three of these together out of indiviual parts and just use an old shoebox for the same price. I wont be buying these again.
1,Outdated,Opened it to check out items and manufactured date was 1992. Waste of money. Threw everything out but blanket. Should have contacted seller but had already thrown away receipt.
5,This One Definately Soars!,Such beautiful music. The arrangements are elegant. I can't seem to hear it enough. Hope there are many more instrumental CD's like this to come from this exquisite artist. Thank-you.
4,Great friend,"It never lets me down. This product is great to use on your own. Cleans easily and has a pretty box were you can storage it forever. I don't know why I haven't nicknamed it, I really should"
5,Beautiful.,"Simply Beautiful. This the first book I have read of Ms.Jones, but I loved it anyways! The plot is complex and delightfully layered. The Science behind the Bannus, the Reingers, Anne, Mordion, are all believable. The characters are not cardboard cut outs, they develope, think, feel, taste, breathe, they could be someone we know. And the pain behind the pasts of Moridion and Anne are also raw and real. Although the Reingers are evil, they have motivations as well. Although, they were still minimally explained. You could read this many times over and not get tired of it. The end paves way for a sequel but although I ache for one, I think its best if its left untampered with. I don't want it to be messed up into oblivion as most sequels end doing to their predecessors."
1,TERRIBLE TONER -- WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!! GOES DRY AFTER 2000 PAGES!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a TERRIBLE toner cartridge. I paid $135.86 for an OEM toner cartridge, thinking it would last a long time.I don't know if they sold me a counterfeit or a used or old OEM, but the cartridge went dry after 2200 pages!!!!!I could not believe it. I only print about 40 pages per week on this printer, which I use at home for letters.WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!!!! You are better off going elsewhere, unless you want to throw your hard-earned money down the drain!"
3,Clarity not the best,The 3D movie could've been better remastered for clarity and color. We have some other 3D movies that are better quality.
3,good performance but way too fast,"First, the mastering by Wilma Cozart Fine and her husband, Robert, results in a beautiful sounding recording. The problem I have with Paray's performance is his accelerated tempo in several pieces. One example is in Rapsodie Espagnole. The first movement, Prelude a la Nuit, starts much too fast. It is a slow, exotic movement with an air of mystery which should be played much slower and more languorously.My other complaint is the fourth movement of Le Tombeau de Couperin, Rigaudon. Once again, this movement starts much too fast, in fact, Paray even cuts several notes in the opening figure. I have several seminal recordings of Rapsodie and Le Tombeau, i.e. Celibidache, Munch, Dutoit and none of them perform these Ravel masterpieces with this speed. I'm not familiar with other Paray performances but, in my opinion, as regards tempo, these performances leave something to be desired."
5,Excellent Choice!,This is a great CD for all fans of Conan type of music. Charles Fox did an excellent job in making you feel as if you are part of a great adventure. Definately worth every penny!
3,Cheap imitation of the real Conan,"I purchased this CD in a store, thinking that it was the real Conan soundtrack. Only later did I notice that the ""Conan"" on the cover wasn't Arnold, just someone who looked very similar. The music is decent, but not powerfull and somewhat dull at times. My advice is to go for the real thing, not an imitaton."
5,Still memorable two decades later,"I read this book when it was first published (23 years ago), and many of the scenes, images, and certainly characters are still vivid. This book was a little eerie, but also very comforting in its own way. It is also reflective of a more trusting world than the one which we currently inhabit. The occasional illustrations were equally haunting. I'm disappointed that The Winds of Time is no longer in print"
5,good condensed overview of mechanical engineering,"This book contains the formula's you need to solve a mechanical engineering problem, without exhausting you with their deriviations. Excellent, clearly written, beautiful lay-out"
2,LeGrand is not Grand!,"Michel Legrand is a wonderful composer,pianist & arranger-but this DVD is terrible.Singers on it-especially Sinatra Jr.,Patti Page & Andy Williams sound horrible. George Benson seems like he forgot the lyrics to Watch What Happens. Why was Jerry Lewis involved with this? The 2 hosts acted like this was the first time they ever did a show. All in all--a poor experience. Buy a Legrand CD--and listen to his music!!"
3,Watch what Happens...?,Obscure collection that just didn't quite convince us the artistry of Michell Legrand. Melissa Manchester and Sting are the most noteworthy of interprerting Michell's songs The Summer Of 42 & What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life.
2,Embarrassing tribute...,"I caught this on PBS and I was amazed how terrible it was. All the name artist were so off key it was painful to listen to. Unfortunately age has caught up to them and it showed. Even Michel Legrand's attempt at singing his pieces were embarrassing. The introductions were done by Jennifer O'Neal and Jon Voight and they both were extremely amateurish. Voight was bouncing around the stage and acting very unprofessional like he was at a ho-down. It was a shame because Mr. Legrand is the composer of some of film's best loved themes and music. I've always loved the theme to ""Summer of '42"" as well as the music for ""Yentl"". But for a program that was suppose to be a tribute of 50 years of work, it was very poorly produced and performed. Watch it on PBS if you must but save your money."
2,Sizing is incorrect,"We bought the Ninja costume for our 7 year old son. He normally wears size 8 clothes. Even though this costume is marked as Medium (8-10) it is way too small. Even though he is thin, he can barely fit into it, and even that requires assistance, making it impossible for him to take to school for the halloween parade. The costume looks pretty cool over all, but since it doesn't fit it's worthless. If your child is smaller it may work. I'm not sure what size it would actually fit. So now I'm off to the local costume store to find a replacement. I don't want to disappoint him. So wish me luck at this late date."
3,ninja costume,"This costume is cool and looks good, however it came with a small hole in arm of the sleeve. Im sure amazon would fix this problem if i returned it but i was afraid i would run out of time before Halloween. I just simply got it sewed back together and that was no problem."
2,Is this from Longs Drugs?,"Seriously cheaply made costume, maybe ONE STEP above the plastic ones I wore as a kid. The ties in the back tore off when trying to tie it, the legs were uneven, with one being longer than the other, and the mask eyeholes were in a weird place, and no my kid is not some weird mutant, just a normal, six year old boy. Not worth the money!"
2,Dragon Warrior for a Day,"My son wanted this costume over all the others, and treasured it right out of the package - ripped seam and all. After a day of loving this costume despite the constant problems, he had to admit it was not going to be able to last another day. I watched it fall apart within a couple hours from nothing more than normal dragon slayer activities."
2,silly design,We got this for my son as a halloween costume and had to ship it back and get a larger size (would have bought a different costume but he was set on this one) the opening for the back is the most flawed design ever my son would have fit the size small but it was impossible to get the hooded part on unless he had the next size up which was quite large on him. the back of the hood is closed and fully attached so the opening in the back sits below the hood enough for your body to get in but somehow you have to manage to get your head into the hood through the body hole if that makes sense. the material wasn't even stretchy so you couldn't even try to pull it up.
1,Everything wrong,"I was sent the wrong ninja costume. Was unable to reach anyone to rectify the problem. The costume says size 8-10, but actually fits a child of about size 5-6. Not well made. Had to sew on the velco on mask and fix a hole in the seam as it is so poorly made. All around bad experience."
4,not bad for the price,The costume did the job for the price I think it worked out well. would have received a 5 except the nose area of the mask did not fit well
4,Item worked out perfectly....thank you,Item fit good and stayed together with no problems. Was purchased for my co workers grandson. He was happy. Thank you
1,Costume,This costume was way TOO small for my eight year old! He's a regular size 8 so it's not like he's a big boy and I could barely get the thing on him. Sent it back over two weeks ago and still don't have my money back. Very disappointed.
2,"Cabanatuan , Murder Under the Sun","I was disappointed in the book. Granted, one may take liberties in writing historical fiction, but within limits. The author describes an actual massacre during the Death March at a roadblock near the town of Balanga. True enough, but in actuality, that particular atrocity was suffered by loyal Filipino troops and not American soldiers as depicted in the novel. The life of a prisoner at Cabanatuan was horrendous, but the prisoners themselves discouraged escape. The Japanese established a ""Rule of Ten."" All prisoners were members of individual ten man squads called, ""blood brothers."" If, someone escaped, those squad members left behind could be summarily executed. This proved very successful in preventing escape at Cabanatuan. Therefore, group escapes as depicted in the novel did not ring true, and in fact, never happened at the prison."
3,It works fine but shipping cost is way too high,I dont know why it costs so much to ship but they work just fine.
2,Inadequate in comparison with other Sociology Dictionaries,"I was so disapointed with this book! In comparison to similar dictionaries I have consulted,I found it to be quite inadeqate and at times not quite accurate in some of the explanations given.There were so many vital concepts,theorists,and theories absent, that it is not really possible to consider it a comprehensive reference for undergrad students embarking on a study of Sociology for the first time.I am almost at Doctoral level and I can honestly say I found relatively little in the book that was of any use to me, whereas I have other dictionaries which I purchased as an undergrad that I still find extremely useful when writing. All in all a very disappointing purchase."
1,Poor Quality,I purchased this collar end of 2009. Now it is in tatters. The exctremely thin outer leather is too fragile and tears up easily.
1,Way overpriced,Not what I expected at all. Way overpriced. Seemed like wide rule to me.Yes the paper is thick. Not legal sized like I thought.Get something better at the local CVS for $3
4,Good guide to the area,"We used this guide in our recent visit to Kansas City and found it to be helpful. Not as helpful as our friends in the area, who knocked themselves out showing us things, but it even gave them some ideas."
2,Reissue of 1988 Book,"Although published in November 2005, this a reissue of a book published in 1988, but it actually reads more like a book written in the 1950s! In 1988 did a couple in their 20s call each other ""darling"" five or six times on one page? And even in 1988 it seems dated that the bridesmaids were going to walk down the aisle wearing gold-mesh-and-pearl snoods and crinolines! If things like that don't bother you and you want to read a light story, buy this book, otherwise, save your money!"
5,Missing Lauren Conrad,"This was the 2nd best season of The Hills (Season 3 is the Best!!). Really highlights how the show has suffered since Lauren left. I think it's a good idea this is the last season, should have ended when LC left!!"
5,Excellent upconverted almost HD quality!,"This is mainly a technical review of the quality of this DVD set...I swear at times it felt like I was watching an HD broadcast of the show. Looked excellent on my 100"" screen with a Mitsubishi HD1000U 720p projector via a PS3. Video is grainy which is good! Makes it look very filmlike...great looking set of DVDs. Highly recommended if you upconverting."
2,"Disk 1, final episode",On the 1st disk of the second season the final episode cuts out 11 minutes into the episode and does not allow you to fast forward or anything.
