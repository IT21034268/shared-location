3,Long Lost Treasure,"This movie aired on CBC in Southern Alberta, Christmas day, when I was about 8 or 9, I have never forgotten the story, but unfortunately did forget the title. Luckily I stumbled upon it on Amazon. I can't wait to see it again."
4,Praying Our Goodbyes by Joyce Rupp,"This book is a good read for almost all levels of life's losses in need of closure. Rupp's detailed explanations for creating a personal ""Praying Good-bye"" space using a symbolic object item from the loss situation, nature, one's faith, etc. facilitates personal wholeness.Although the writer's Christian faith is predominant in this work, the book can be acclimated to all faiths and perhaps to those with a lack thereof. It is the one book I return to for myself or, when appropriate, to give as a gift to others who may be experiencing a grief, retirement and other loss issues."
4,Praying Our Goodbyes / Book,Good book ~~~ It covers many different situations a person might have to give up or say goodbye to in life...Very helpful~~
1,UGLIEST DOLL EVER.,"this doll looks pretty in the box...but when you take it out IT LOOKS LIKE A MAN. I AM NOT KIDDING. the doll is hidious and LOOKS NOTHING LIKE PRINCESS LEIA. i was soo disaponted when i got it, i was thinking ""OH MY, SHE LOOKS LIKE A MAN!!"" this doll was a wast of money.the doll's hair was glued to her head so u can't style her hair.i really dislike this doll.From: a dissapointed kid"
4,"Another fine 12"" Star Wars figure","This Princess Leia figure (as seen in A New Hope) was part of the early wave of Kenner's 12"" Collector Series line. It's not the work of art that the later Sideshow figures are, but I really enjoyed the `90s 12"" figure line.Pros - The figure has good articulation, and the outfit is quite well done. I also like that the blaster pistol was the one she was shown using early in the film. It's also a major plus that the figure is scaled down so she's appropriately shorter than the Luke and Han figures.Cons - The head sculpt could have been a lot better. It's not terrible, but it's not all that pretty either.It's not as impressive as theStar Wars Princess Leia 12-Inch Action Figure, but this Princess Leia figure is still one of the better figures from the Collector Series line."
1,Different product arrived than what was advertised,"I love the Acid Soothe capsules (not the chewables) and have been using them for a year. They work better then any prescription I have tried. However, I ordered these as an ""add on"", the price was amazing but instead I received the chewables. Unfortunately, the chewables do not have the same ingredients as the regular capsules, not even close, so this was unacceptable. Amazon has offered to refund my money if I return the product which is great but now I have to reorder the correct product and at a much steeper price. I am also stuck with an extra item that I really didn't need but ordered to fulfill the minimum requirements of the ""add on"" program (orders had to be over $25). I would have preferred that they offer to replace with the correct product, as advertised, instead. Be aware that they may be advertising the wrong product."
5,"Great, nostaligic fun!","I bought this mainly for that opening song: ""Today is Tuesday, you know what that means...""This volume, as with the other volumes of this set, is mostly superb. Great quality, fun cartoons. Odd, but in some scenes, you see newer Mouseketeers and the host, ""Bob"". Still, I didn't want this tape to end.Aside for the Mouseketeer singing and dancing, the best part was the old cartoon, ""The Clock Store.""No doubt about it: This was the best children's show of the '50s."
4,Barabara kabisa!,"This is an excellent album which I initially bought for $5 as a cut price cassette. This really catches the mood of top class Congolese rhumba from the classic 60's/70's era. Very popular among my African buddies, I recommend this for all fans of this genre along with Tabu Ley's fantastic 'Africa Worldwide' & Franco/TPOK Jazz's 1972/73/74 (Azda) & 1970/71/72 collections."
5,A delightful read,A delighful new approach to home organization. Very focused on 50 specific areas that can be applied to many other situations. Great for the reader short on time but needing both motivation and an understanding of practical methods of organization for the busy family. Written in a positive and crisp manner...
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is by far the worst, most superficial treatment of the subject matter I have ever seen. Dont waste your money on this book. You would do better with Don Aslett's books or Julie Morgenstein or both. This book was like an essay written by a bored middle school student."
3,"May be OK, but not that funny","I believe it is very difficult to write a book about writing about humor. Truman's book is no exception.It is better than some of the others, however, because he has no axe to grind about humor. Instead, he points to the ""Lego"" building blocks of humor and where one can find them: current events, personal experiences, marriage, travel, sports, church or religion, pets, and so forth. Truman also spends considerable time describing how to sell humor to people who want it, but he is totally discouraging about how much one will be paid for this.If you are looking for a laugh in this book, you will find a couple; but if you are looking on how to write something laughable, then perhaps this one is it."
2,Rimshot.... fail,"""Writing Humor for more than Laughs"" spends much more time on identifying the different places people use humor than teaching anything about writing it. Whats worse is the parts which the author obviously intended to be funny, just aren't. Truman's idea of humor may appeal others but for me, particularly in light of the near total absence of anything instructional, it was a big waste of time."
1,Never another Seagate,I bought this drive because I needed the disc space for video editing. It worked fine for a couple of months then windows explorer kept locking up my computer while trying to access the drive. Seagate was zero help at all. Their suggestion was to reformat and start over. So I backed all my data and reformatted. 2 months later it is locking my computer up again. I have two WD external drives and they work great. If I unplug the Seagate then I have no problems. I will be buying a large internal to replace it.
1,Awful,"I guess you can't really judge by my review because I bought one of these when they first came out, and it had SO many problems! It worked just fine for the first couple of days and I loved it! It came with like, 20 free downloads or something, but after using those up, it started going downhill. I put some albums on it, and when I would listen to them and turn the volume up, it would turn itself back down to the lowest setting and I couldn't listen to it. After a few days of that, I returned it and bought an iPod. I've had it for the last 5 years and not one single problem."
2,Nice Slim...but...Pictures never loaded!!!,"I had to turn it back because i tried to laod pic on it and when I went to the program in the mp3 player it said list empty. The pictures where there but could never see them...Strange.Music played great, the handling was nice, it looks neat on the outside. Cant complain about that nice colors.To bad I never got to see the pics. maybe it was a 1 in a liftime problem. I gave it back."
1,Don't bother,Required to use Windows Media player to transfer music. That's an ugly experience.So-so music quality. No lossless music formats supported.I watched the ease with which my daughter transferred music on her iPod with envy.Just returned mine.The whole thing was no fun!Tom Morris
3,Shuts Off,"I bought this player almost a year ago. I used it mainly for gym use. About a month or two ago, I noticed it just shutting off for no reason. I then relized that everytime I tapped the top of the mp3 player, its shut off. It has gotten so bad that I cant even use it at the gym unless I move VERY SLOWLY! so it doesnt aggrivate it and shuts off...VERY FRUSTRATING! Customer service said they would replace it, but going through UPS and sending it to them and THEN taking 4-6 weeks?..I think I may just go with the smallest I-pod for the gym next time. I am thinking if I wasnt using it for gym use, that it may have lasted longer..."
5,Sibelius with C Davis,"I know that many prefer Colin Davis earlier Sibelius cycle with Boston symphony on Philips, good as they are, this version of the second symphony can hold its own against any competition in the catalogue. Fire and ice goes through this version. Intense and well-played in fine sound. Strongly recommended. I must say that this version almost outclasses Barbirollis famous version on Chesky. The intensity can almost be too much. Marvellous!Above all, much better then the bad-sounding LSO live version made some years after this recording was made."
2,You can do better,"I know that Sir Collin Davis deserves much credit for his good work in championing the Music of Sibelius.The Seven Symphonies are wonderful and still generally underappreciated works.However, I couldn't help but find this recording a bit ponderous and dull.Tempi are slow, articulation is flabby, and there is a general lack of passion and energy that this music requires.The recordings of Paavo Berglund with the Helsinki Philharmonic are really beautiful and would be, I believe, a much better introduction to this music"
2,Bland,"There's no contest if you're trying to decide between this and the two Philips 2-fers: the Philips recordings are more flowing, better-recorded, and contain more drama and attention to the long line and long argument--so important in Sibelius. Based not just on these but his other recordings recently, Colin Davis seems to be softening in old age. Leslier Gerber's statement that these recordings are *more* aggressive baffles me. Compare literally any section side by side and you'll find the climaxes here more muted (the tympani is particularly dull and ""thuddy""), the string-playing less taut, and the overall conception far less edgy. The sound is a little fuzzy too. When the complete set, plus overtures, tone poems and violin concerto can be had on Philips for about thirty bucks, there's no contest, and no reason this cycle was even necessary."
1,It lasted less time than it took to ship,"I ordered this pot and was very excited for it to arrive. When it finally reached me after 5 days or so I unpacked it and immediately made a pot. It was delicious.Now, less than a week after opening it I am preparing to ship it back. It has already stopped functioning. Two days ago the pump started hissing and whining as it worked. Today neither the pump nor the heating area works at all. I am very disappointed. I used it for less time than it took to get to me.To dispel any counter argument: I used filtered water, followed the instructions exactly as written and even consulted the trouble-shooting FAQ for the model. With luck, this was just a dud and the replacement will have a longer lifespan."
1,mr coffee,3 months old and it quit working......motor burned up... needless to say i rate this coffee maker one star only because there is no rating lower than one starMr. Coffee sent me a replacement coffee maker.6 months later the same thing has happened. Heating element does not heat anymore.
2,Undependable clock,"The clock on my coffee maker has reset itself, jumping one or two hours, without anyone having touched it. This makes it impossible to use the delay brew function with confidence. This is a shame because the coffee maker is otherwise well designed."
1,stopped working after only 1 week.,What more can I say? I bought the exact same machine from JC Penneys a week agoand tonight it just stopped working. The water just stays there with no action.I googled to see if there was a fix and found this page. I'm kinda gladso many other users of Mr Coffee machines have had the same problem.Because that means there is something SERIOUSLY WRONG about the qualityof these machines and that mine wasn't just a fluke. I'm returning it tomorrow.Never will touch a Mr Coffee again.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could!,This model sucks! From the start it leaked water all over the counter. I cleaned under it DAILY. Pouring in 8 cups of water would give you 7 cups of coffee. The thing is cheaply made and was cheap so.... you get what you pay for I guess. Just bought a model by Cuisinart and IT works! Do not buy this coffee maker unless you enjoy wasting your money.
1,"Worked great for 5 months, then nothing.","I bought it about 5 months ago and it worked just as it should. Then one morning, the coffee making stopped. I tried to locate the issue, but there was nothing apparent. Power worked, the clock worked, the timer worked, but the pump, water heater and burner stopped working. I was just a couple of days before moving across country, so there was not time to take it apart and try to diagnose the problem."
1,A sputtering nightmare,"This coffee maker does not get me hard.The coffee it makes is so-so, nothing remarkable, standard Mr. Coffee fare.But every time I use it (5 days a week), the brewing process takes longer... It brews a pot in 10 minutes, then sputters and steams for another 45 minutes. You cannot tell the maker to stop brewing but keep the hot plate turned on, so simply hitting the ""off"" switch offers no recourse. Meanwhile, I have to sit there and listen to it sputter to no end while dripping ever so slowly to top off that final 1/4 of a cup.When I first got the coffee maker it didn't sputter this badly, but after a year of use I'm ready to throw this out and get something that turns me on instead of making me dread making the morning ""Joe.""There are countless better options for $30. Do better."
2,One year.....that's it!!!,I purchased this coffee maker on 9/12/11 and this morning 9/19/12 it did not greet me with a pot of coffee.....just a glowing light and an empty cold pot!!! I was expecting more and am not too sure if I will purchase another one.
1,Last Mr Coffee for us,Just threw my last Mr. Junkee in the trash. This one lasted less then 2 years.Model CGX23. Hard to believe this garbage doesn't last. Hope to find a quality coffee maker now. Guess I learned my lesson. The decanters outlast the coffee makers now.
2,Mr. Coffee CGC-20 Coffeemaker,I returned this coffeemaker after one week. The cord is too short and the lid does not snap closed. In my case the lid was also too high when opened. It hit my cabinet and with the cord so short I could't bring it forward (the cord had to go behind my microwave)(limited counter space.
2,Disappointed,Just bought this yesterday and am only keeping it because of the low price and I don't want to take the time to make a return. Using a mail-in rebate the cost was only 15.00. I don't like that condensation builds up on the inside of the coffee maker's lid and when opened spills out of the machine. I don't like that in order to get the last cup or so of coffee from the decanter you have to turn the decanter almost upside down....this is due to the design of the glass pot. The unit is not easy to clean due to the large size of its lid. I would not recommend this unit.
2,It wears out much faster than expected.,"I've owned this coffee pot for 4 years come this Christmas.The coffee machine began to leak water when it brewed this past Spring, 2006; you have the machine in small puddle of water.For the 3-4 times/week it is used to make morning coffee, so it should not have worn out so quickly. Which leads me to believe it is a POORLY MADE CHEAP Coffee Maker.For $50+ it cost, I'm very disappointed."
2,Won't survive the long haul,"I bought this coffee maker mostly because of the timer feature. I have to say that worked just fine. While the coffee maker worked, we really had no complaints. We brew one pot of coffee every morning. However, one night while setting the timer, my husband forgot to dump the leftover coffee out from the previous morning so he got up to an overflowing pot. We only had the coffee maker for about a month and after the overflow it will not work at all. I know this is our fault, but I do expect a coffee maker to be more durable than that. Just be aware that if you (or your spouse) is the forgetful type, you might want to consider a different coffee maker because this one will not stand up to your memory lapses."
1,Junk,"Very disappointed. I had one of these for many years and was happy with it. I replaced it because the hot plate was disintegrating. I bought the same model. The pause function leaked terribly. The glass carafe stained within weeks with frequent washings, and the carafe broke with very little force. Waste of money."
2,not what it used to be,Coffee is not hot....does not extract a good flavor. Water is not heating hot enough to brew. Just okay pot.
1,Defective Product,"My Mr Coffee sucks it quit working after a month and they will not replace it, should have gone to the store where they would have replaced it with out a hassle."
2,Lukewarm,"I expected a better quality product from Mr. Coffee for the price paid. The digital display is very hard to read. Don't think it's working properly. Can only read part of the numbers. When brewing, it's very noisy at the end. I expected better quality."
4,Mr. Coffee CGX23,"The Mr. Coffee CGX23 mades great coffee. Not a long wait time for the coffee to be ready to drink. Very happy. Only problem - just make sure that after the water has been added the cover is secure. If not, a lot of hot steam can escape."
1,Giant Piece of Import Crap,"Save your money (spend more actually)-this piece of Chinese-made garbage lasted less than one year. Was not used much at all and just gave up the ghost one morning-heating element failed and that was it. Manufacturer's solution is to drive 50-60 miles to drop it off at a repair facility and pay more than the initial cost to get it fixed. In other words, it's a throw-away that you need to replace every year. My previous unit was an old US-made (at that time)Proctor Silex that we had for 10-12 years and just replaced because it had gotten so worn looking-BUT IT STILL WORKED!! Stupid me-I should have kept it. I'm going to spend some real money and get a European-made unit that will last more than a year. You've been warned."
1,stopped working after only a few short months.,I liked the style and look of this inexpensive coffee maker. It did brew coffee quickly and kept the coffee hot. But it also dripped water that condensed after brewing when making coffee and it only worked for 4 months. Stopped working completely.
5,Mr. Coffee Does it Again!,"Love my new coffee maker. Has everything it needs without a lot of clutter. Easy to operate, attractive and makes great coffee. Love it!"
1,Made it about 4 months,"Got as a Xmas present from the inlaws. It's now May 4, so I guess it made it about 4 months for our 3-5 times a week usage. Now the green light turns on and it functions as a clock, but won't heat up water or the burner. Customer service consists of a directory of local repair centers. Why buy brand name if this is the result?"
3,Not as good as they used to be,"Mr. Coffee makes good coffee, but Mr. Coffee machines used to be wonders of good design. In this new version, you have to press the buttons just so to get them to work, so I expect them to jam and break in no time. There's no light behind the clock, so using the machine as a kitchen clock, as the write-up suggested, works only if you're standing within a couple of feet of the machine. The white plastic carafe top is stained (brownish) after just a few weeks, no matter how I scrub. On my old Mr. Coffee, the arm that delivers the water into the coffee basket swung back far enough to make it easy to clean or dry the basket receptacle. The design of this new version makes it hard to get at the whole receptacle.Again, it makes coffee, and that's the main thing. But I don't think I'll have long to wait before I'll have to buy a new coffeemaker, and it won't be a Mr. Coffee."
2,Had the potential to be a great coffeemaker,"I was very excited when I first bought this coffeemaker five weeks ago. It had everything I wanted in a coffeemaker. It was very stylish, convenient, easy to use, did not drip when pouring, was programmable, made a good cup of coffee, had cord storage, wasn't too large, had automatic shut-off after 2 hrs., etc. Too bad it stopped working after only 5 weeks of light use. I used it 3 to 4 times a week for one pot at a time. All of the sudden, the water wouldn't come through. I tried cleaning it as recommended, but to no avail. All it did was sputter and steam up my whole kitchen. Maybe I got a dud, but I returned it to Walmart and bought a different brand. Too bad, since I had such high hopes for this one."
1,"Makes good coffee, BUT...","This is the messiest coffee maker I've ever owned. The basket drips when you pull the carafe out, and the carafe design dribbles when you pour. Lots of cleanup every time you use it. It finally died and we bought the Sunbeam TGX23 for only $20. No more mess and good coffee."
5,My son was very happy with it,This was a gift for my son who had just purchased his first home and he tried it out here at our house at Christmas and he was very happy with it.
2,Pot breaks very easily,"We've bought two of these and both times the glass pots have broken, and they break very easily. I would spend more money on something more durable"
2,Drips & Leaks,Do not like the condensation buildup up on lid that runs onto countertop. Filter basket leaks when the pot is removed dripping coffee onto the hotplate.
1,one of the worst coffee makers I have ever purchased,"This coffee maker was recommended by a friend.1. Water does not get hot enough.2. after brewing, every time I removed the carafe, the coffee would drip onto the bottom hot plate. It burned and smelled terrible.3. Difficulty in placing the carafe back under the maker to catch the coffee. Have to push hard, and then the coffee maker would move across the counter. Irritating, as if it was filled with water, it would splash out the back.4. Two holes in the back where the water reservior is...for what???? besides spilling?5. Removing the coffee grinds, pain in the a**. The cold coffee drips out of the bottom.Worse buy ever."
5,Fantastic!,I was surprised when my Mr. Coffee pot arrived in such a timely matter. I washed it then made a new pot of coffee. I was without coffee for day's! The first and subsequent pot of coffee has been delicious. I felt the cost was very economical. I was very pleased with my new coffee maker and would buy from this source again.Patricia M. Poland
2,Ok for what you pay,"The coffee maker works fine, but it takes over 10 min to brew a pot of coffee. It is really sow, but simple to use."
2,Will Never Buy Another Mr. Coffee,"OK, the price is right, I guess you get what you pay for, but I WILL NEVER have another Mr. Coffee coffeemaker It is IMPOSSIBLE to pour without it spilling or dripping, every tiime. I have sworn at it so many times and determined never to buy another one that pours like that, no matter how cheap it is."
1,Do Not Buy!!!!,"This coffee maker is terrible! The pot is poorly engineered and can not be poured with out at least some (and usually a lot) of spillage. The maker itself isn't so bad, the programing function works properly and the coffee is decent minus a few undissolved graduals in each pot. Obviously this is a lower end pot so I wasn't expecting anything gourmet, but I was expecting to be able to poor the coffee in the cup!"
1,"""Your pot cometh, ordereth or not!""","First and foremost, I had not even finished the ordering process (had been kicked out)when I was informed that the product was on its way! I had been considering a new pot because my ""old"" (christmas present) wasn't keeping the coffee hot. When the coffee pot that I had not ordered arrived, I had the option to return it but opted instead to keep it in hopes that it would deliver the boiling hot coffee which I love! The first few pots were almost what I wanted but I was soon back to heating freshly brewed coffee in the microwave.I think I will just go back to throwing grounds into ice cold well (or creek) water in my old camping pot and boiling it over an open fire! Course I would have to move back to Alaska if I were going to build a fire in my front yard!I live on a desert in Arizona now (Tucson) but still want my coffee boiling hot...even at 110 degrees!Thanks for asking,Lindac"
2,Mr. Coffee goes south,Enough said. Good Buy? No. Goodbye. I'm finished. Mr. Coffee has gone to be with Mrs. Coffee. May their time together be rich and robust.
3,"Good, low cost option (but see update)","Over a couple months since finally breaking my cheap Braun machine I have found this to make consistent coffee with no negative issues. It is fairly easy to clean. I purchased the separate gold coffee filter. I've used the timer a couple times with no problems. It is reasonably stylish. It's an excellent option for the price--especially with the ubiquitous BB&Beyond coupons that come in the mail. UPDATE: Inexplicably, if you make more than about 6 cups at a time the water in the filter overflows. You need to run half the water, turn it off, then run the next half. Perhaps this is because I used the optional gold filter, but it is still a glaring design flaw."
2,Timer Stopped Working,"This was a great deal and worked super until something happened to the display, couldn't read all the numbers, and that seemed to stop the timer (delay) function from working. We used it daily, but it only lasted about three months."
1,"Piece of Junk, only good for weeks","We had our first one for a couple months and it quit. Returned it to the store and got a replacement, same model, and it also quit after a few weeks.Our first Mr. Coffee lasted for years. It must have been made in America.We'll move to a different brand."
5,Metrologic Orbit Presentation Laser Barcode Scanner MS7120Metrologic Orbit Presentation Laser Barcode Scanner MS7120,"Very happy with this scanner.Its neat and doesn't take up much space, but more importantly, its very responsive to the bar codes as opposed to some other scanners from the same manufacturer. Would definitely purchase again"
1,Shun electric knife sharpener,Poor quality product. It is cheap probably as it is made in china..wouldn't recommend this product. It has nearly broke my shuns knife edge...
5,works great!,It's quick and easy to use (and also easy to clean) - just works as expected: makes my shun chef knife super sharp and back to the original state!
3,Maybe not for pros but good for me,"The problem with this one is that you have to go through the rough and the fine stone at the same time, there is no separation, but the end result is good for me (for now, until they come with a better one)So for me it is O.K."
4,Knife Saver!,LOVE my Shun Knives I got 2 years ago for my birthday.Shun DMS300 Classic 3-Piece Boxed Cutlery SetUnfortunately they DO need the edge refreshed from time to time. This sharpener does just that. We also have been using it on our Cutco set and it works very well.I would recommend using a good steel on your edges between uses do you don't rely on this sharpener too much. You'll end up wasting good steelShun DM0750 Sharpening Steel
3,"I needed a Shun sharpener, but...","... this thing is a DRY sharpener. Works OK, but you have to get used to the rasping sounds of the ceramic wheels at work. TheShun Electric Knife Sharpener.IS nice and small, it thing only works for Shun (15-degree) knives. American and German knives (Henkels, Wusthof, etc.) are sharpened to broader (20-degree) angles, so they will lose their edge faster and hence be ground down before their time.Shun blades are so hard that water stones take too long. The original Shun (factory) edge is also concave cut. There are other sharpeners out there that might do a better job - I saw aChef'sChoice 1520 AngleSelect Diamond Hone Electric Knife Sharpenerused at a local cooking store. Much more what I had in mind - I just added one to my wish list."
1,Unconscionably terrible piece of worthless junk.,"Whoa there, why don't you say what you mean?So I did. There used to be a different review of this sloppily-crafted knife devouring pile of unrelated non-functional plastic parts, with a lot of 1 star reviews. I did a bit of research and VIOLA! The part number changed, to AP0119 from AP119. That fixed all the stuff that was wrong with the last one.Not.Shun should be bloody ashamed of this cheesy little junk pile. It couldn't not be a more insidious waste of your money. Such nice blades, and then they put their name on this garbage.Go ahead and read all the other reviews. Go on. Sparkly, twinkly reviews about how this thing is just the bee's knees. You'll buy one.And you'll be thrilled with it, so long as you don't need to use your knives to cut with."
2,Good moisture but quick heat loss,"If you want warmth, this is a low-cost, easy-to-use product. If you want real sustained heat, it doesn't seem like the answer. I can only get about 5 minutes of solid heat out of my 12"" x 18"" Therabeads pad. That's just not enough for therapeutic use."
5,Thera bead pad smells,"The reviewer who complained of the smell is right but doesn't know how to avoid it. The smell comes from food residue in your microwave. The thin ""cover"" provided is to protect the skin from direct contact with the hot pad. I have had these as long as they've been made--have had back (disc) pain for 40 years. The answer I have found is using a thin towel wrapped around the pad while in the microwave which absorbs smells from the unit and can be kept afterward when hot, instead of a useless cover, while applying it to your body. The additional advice is to clean the microwave and especially the glass rotating plate and to wash the towel after 1-2 uses, or every time. Do these things and you will have little or no smell and no need discard the pad before its time."
3,Great in the beginning...,Loved this in the beginning but soon after multiple uses started to smell bad...had to throw it away...family complained! :)
5,Another great Hyperion Art of Disney animation title,I can't add a lot to what others have said except that the size and paper quality on these early Hyperion titles are desirable in my opinion. I love looking at the imagery large and feeling the thick paper between my fingers (sorry I'm a bibliophile). These books are designed to last a lifetime.
1,impure bhakti,"I was looking for pure devotional service to Krishna, but this film only shows conditional service with God as an order supplier. Krishna has to fulfill all the material wishes of his devotee to ""fix"" his life. This is hardly the essence of pure bhakti. If I pray to God, then I will get what I want materially is the message of this movie. Rather I wanted to see unmotivated service as the final message. It's rare to find such great souls who understand these things. They weren't writing and directing this movie."
4,You should buy this!,"It's a wonderful book for learning history of polyhedra, but I think it has too little 'mathematics' in. All in all, it's a masterpiece in my mathbook collection."
3,A Mixed Bag...not sure what I just watched,"Being an aficionado of horror films my entire life, I struggled before writing this review. While I loved the premise, the makeup, the cast, and the film sets, there was something missing from this Clive Barker book. It had its moments, but they were slow...congested...repetitive...and boring. It never grabbed me. It never scared me. The premise had all of the tools to have us jumping out of our skin...but it just didn't work out that way. It deserves 2 1/2 stars...but I gave it 3 because I want others to sample this ditty. If you haven't seen a slew of horror flicks like me, you may ,love it. I liked it. Barker needs to bark up a better tree next time."
2,Sadly disappointed,"I was looking forward to this movie, after being entertained by the recent Midnight Meat Train release. Sadly, I was quite disappointed. Certainly not one of Clive's better works. It moved too slowly and the romantic connection between the main characters were overplayed."
1,A dead end film about the dead having highways,"I'm a fan of Clive Barker, but as one of the other reviewers stated the lulls in this movie were too many and too long. BORING!! If it were not for the gore I would have dozed off watching this mess. Aside from the bad adoptation, what I found very annoying was the darkness of the movie- and I'm not talking about tone- I'm talking about the fact that I couldn't SEE about 1/3 of the film. The use of shadows and darkness always work well in horror movies but in this case I think they were using it to cover up cheap sets."
1,Book of Bland,"I can't believe Clive Barker let his name be used anywhere near this movie. One cool scene at the beginning and then an hour and a half of some boring love story. John Harrison and Darin Silverman did a terrible job at writing the screenplay from the original stories. I've read Clive Barker for years, and if he is anything, he isn't boring. Good luck making it through this one...I didn't."
1,Horrible. Absolutley horrible.,"This movie was revolting. The people that made it should be ashamed.These wonderful works by Clive Barker have been violated by this movie. I am proud of Clive Barker for not actually directing this.It never touched on a single actual ""Book of Blood"" which are short stories, since the movie didn't even allude to that.Also, the sex scenes were too racy and normal to even remotely be attached to Clive Barker's name. If you follow his work, you know that it is a rare occurrence that simple heterosexual sex ending in orgasm and a night in bed together happens. Clive usually throws in a cenobite or at least minimal mutilation.I believe that these people that made this movie, slapped ""Clive Barker"" on the title and figured it would make money. They didn't get my 18 dollars.Also, the ""how books of blood were made"" idea of the movie, was not enough substance to even make four paragraphs in a book, let alone a movie.I want my two hours back."
2,PARANORMAL NONSENSE,"I'VE NEVER BEEN OVERLY IMPRESSED WITH THE MOVIES MADE ON BARKER'S WORKS..WITH PERHAPS THE EXCEPTION OF HELLRAISER. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME SPOOKY MOMENTS, THEY CAN'T COMPENSATE FOR THE CONVOLUTED PLOT. THE REVELATION THAT SOPHIE WARD'S CHARACTER IS THE VILLAIN COMES OUT OF NOWHERE. MAYBE I'M JUST TOO CONVENTIONAL BUT I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS FILM."
4,The Basics,"My boyfriend used this with me the day I got it (yesterday). I was nervous (made him turn the main light off) but it wasn't really awkward at all. Actually, I liked it more when he did it than when I tried it myself this afternoon. I'm kind of a more natural girl, and it could have been longer, but other than that, it's awesome for what you are paying for and fits the description given very well. So, if what you are looking for is something like this, search no more."
1,Stopped working after a month,It was good while it work. But stopped working after a month. I wish the quality was better. I feel like I wasted my money. 1 stars because we only enjoyed for the few times it worked.
1,Doesnt Fit,"teh rabbit ears dont hit the right spot on myself, while the actual shaft is a nice fit, not worth it it doesnt stay in place as the swivel motion is too all over the place, not worth the investment"
2,Not a funny joke..,"I bought one of these as a gag gift.. jokes on me. After the laughted expelled from watching my grandmother open this in terror and giving it back I couldent find much use.So doing what any normal guy would do I set it on fire, and it was glorious.. But after the exitment I realized I had bought a dildo.. gave it to an elder.. then burnt the love stick into a purple pile of nothing. It was at this point I realized, I am an idiot."
2,Not worth the money,This product is all hype and very disappointing. It doesn't even rotate when squeezed and isn't that the point? Definitely not worth the cost.I do recommend the Doc Johnson ivibe Rabbit. It's a little less expensive with guaranteed results! :)
4,Sex toys are a true adventure!,"This Vibe is a great instrument. After reading the past reviews i am extremely careful with it (my bf on the other hand is not lol) It works well. Yet, i have noticed that when you use both the vibrating part and the movement part for the shaft at the same time, both of their ""power"" lessons."
4,why rotate?,"I've had a couple rabbit style toys in the past. This one is pretty nice, but the rabbit/vibrator is positioned strangely. You kind of have to pull on the ears for it to be in the right spot but outside of that, it works like a charm every time .... the batteries seem to last a few goes, too."
1,OUCH!!!,Ouch - This was very uncomfortable. The lip of the head has a big indentation and gets caught on your vaginal muscle when you take it out. The whole thing is just very uncomfortable when it's inside you and the spinning beads (which I thought would really add to an orgasm - rubbing on the G spot) didn't do much at all. It's very hard to reach and change the controls. The vibration is too mild for me. I had an orgasm but it was weak and I couldn't get that thing out of me fast enough. Give me one of those cheap but strong messagers that come with all the different attachments. Put on the small node attachment and I'm a happy girl!
4,Unbelievable multiple orgasms,"Short of getting both setting just right. This is an incredible device. It is my first, and won't be my last.A bit noisy but the right music takes care of that.When he won't or can't, it will and does."
5,Incredible! Absolutely Incredible!,"The Rabbit is absolutely incredible and a great alternative when you need a little ""extra."" Simulating intercourse with the shaft and the rabbit ears touching my clitoris repeatedly, my feet go numb. Yes, numb! Turn this bad boy up all the way and you will have a mind-blowing orgasm, I kid you not! Personally, the swirling beads don't do anything for me, but the rabbit ears drive me nuts. I bought one of these for a friend whose husband was not quite up to par, and she uses the darn thing practically every day when her daughter takes her morning nap. Incredible - that's all, just incredible!!!"
2,"I like rabbits, but not this one.","I recommend one with the metal balls on tracks, instead of the plastic balls all bunched up in a lump like this one has. The ones with metal balls tend to be better made, in addition to (in my opinion) feeling much better. Besides, sometimes the plastic balls seem to arrange themselves in such a way that they're almost painful."
2,Does not last,"This was the first sex toy I have ever had. It's not very good. After using it a few times the neck of it - well it didn't exactly break, I guess, but it sort of changed position and wasn't the same and it didn't stay in very well and it didn't feel very good. Also, the vibrations weren't very powerful in the first place."
5,super rabbit,Wow! this product is so amazing. When my wife used it for the time she couldn't wait to do it again. The motor is so powerful that makes her feel crazy. She could have an orgasm in less than 3mins.This is her first toy and she loves it so much. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
1,Dont waste your money,"I recently purchased this item, the cost was around $21 and the shipping was $9-00 approx.The item looks like something you would buy in a toy store, it is flimsy, and the so called page spring holders, are in need of a redesign.In my opinion, you could make something up yourself, If you need an item like this try and find it in a local store, at least you can see beforehand what you are getting."
1,1 Star for effort!,"you suck, your album and your crew is wack....people you need to get the real ish, Poetic Records cds...especially Poetic Thug ""Da One & Only""...get that platinum album. Southern Saucy is the wackest group i have ever heard and they are faker than silicone tetaz. Oh yeah, Poetic Records started LENE TOWN!"
4,finally a different type of anime,"if you are sick of aliens and shoot 'em ups, this series is great! very deep stuff here."
1,Color display problem and Electronic Hum,"This TV has the color display problem, there is an abnormal spot of red color on the lower left corner of the TV and an abnormal spot of green color on the lower right corner of the TV. I discovered it when I connect it to my dvd player, where dvd player itself has no problem. It supposes to show me a blue screen with dvd player's brand name on it, but it showed me these two additional abnormal color spot, which is so annoying. Especially when I watch movie with subtitle of white color on left right and all subtitle on the right side changed to light green color.Also there is electronic hum when I turn on the TV, but it's not really a big deals.It might be just this one has such problem, so I returned it as a defective unit."
3,A Superb Spanish Language Play for Students,En La Ardiente Oscuridad is an excellent Spanish language play for students.I read this book as a junior in high school and found it to be neither too difficult nor too easy. The plot of the play is basic but satisfactory. Highly recommended for all Spanish language students and readers.
3,Young Ivanhoe,"I mainly purchased this film because I had seen Kris Holdenreid in the first series of ""The Tudors"" and was impressed with his acting. I also saw him in a minor role in ""Rowing Trough"". This film is a low budget production with a few ""names"" in it to give it credibility. I was disappointed with the performances of Stacey Keach and Margot Kidder, but Kris Holdenreid was delightful in the role of the young Ivanhoe, bearing in mind it was very early in his career. I would like to see more of his acting now that he has matured. The film could have been much better with a bigger budget. I enjoyed it because of Kris."
3,Easy to watch,"Not the greatest movie ever made but one that is good for a rainy day. I bought it because it was and early film of Kris Holden-Ried and was not disappointed. I'd been told he did a good joy for a young actor and they were right. Some of the more experienced actors and actresses could really have been better, but perhaps they were not taking their parts seriously. So if you are purchasing this because you are a Kris Holden-Ried fan ENJOY! You will like what you see ;)"
1,fell apart in 1 week,The method of attaching the brush bristles to the base was poor. The glue cracked and the bristles fell off within 1 week.
3,Decent,"I purchased this along with a Giottos Rocket Air Blaster for small pieces of dust that were stuck on the camera's sensor and that couldn't be removed with air alone. Honestly, I have had much of a need for it lately. The rocket air blaster takes care of almost anything that I need to remove. While the blower brush offers the ability to brush dust or other items away, the air power isn't really enough to do anything else. Save your money and just go for the air blaster. The air blaster for the camera sensor and a microfiber cloth for a lens when required is about the only two items you need."
3,Medtner lacks structure,"I have only heard the performance of the Medtner Sonata Reminiscenza from this disc. Kissin makes a mess of one of my favorite works, using a kind of all-purpose rubato in almost every bar. The Medtner is a huge piece that demands a firm structural grasp as is evidenced in Gilels's classic recordings. Compared with Gilels, Kissin has yet to understand the overall design of the sonata. Gilels uses rubato much more subtly, so that when he does make an expressive point it has a far greater effect: indeed his performances are heart-breaking. If all I knew of this work was Kissin's performance, I would probably never want to hear the piece again."
2,Winter-Cotton-Margolin riding Water's Mud Flaps,"You thought this was a Muddy Waters CD? Not so, majority of the vocals here are Winter and Cotton, with Muddy Waters singing some or part of only 5 songs on this 11 song disc. Unless you want to hear James Cotton imitate a young man singing like a girl, pass this up and head for the real deal that this tour sprung from, the excellent Muddy Waters ""Hard Again"" disc. Even ""Got My Mojo Workin'"" begins with Johnny Winter singing vocals on the song Muddy Waters made into a classic."
2,Not what you think......,"If ""Hard again"" is one of your favorites, and if you think this will be more of the same.......Sorry!It simply is not! It may be that these are cuts from the same sessions, but there is a real goodreason they didn't make it on the prime CDs......they are sub-standard quality....they are theculls......It was very disappointing........This is somebody trying to hustle a buck on the reputationof some really fine music, which this isn't......sorry, but that's the truth."
5,Rockin'!,"The performances on this CD are very high energy, rockin' performances. ""Mama Talk to Your Daughter"" is one of my favorite blues songs, and they do a great job with it here. The band is fantastic! Just another example of how great Muddy Waters really was!"
1,Unsanitary sweatshop product,"This thing has rust already on the bottom seam, the top is uneven and sharp, there's flux at the bottom, it leaks, but I'm not sending it back. I'm sending it to the FDA!"
5,holds beer in center!!!,Great product! I especially like how easy it is to clean...love the stainless steel. Highly recommend!
5,A reference from 21st Century,"This book is awesome ! Book has collection from prints, ads, flyers, personel portfolio, web designs, illustrations, book cover designs... in 21st Century.It catagorised it by artist and exhibitions. You can find www.requiemforadream.com and www.donniedarko.com designer and many other cool projects. And text info is in 3 languages, English, German, French.Any graphic designer must have this book. :)"
2,Was a great product,"I really used to like the Altoids. All the flavors were niceand strong, and had a nice kick. Recently the manufacturer has begum adding corn syrup solids or some ""corn"" product, and since i'm allergic to corn, I've had to stop using them.Bummer."
3,Mixed,"I'm a doctoral student in a leadership program, so take this with a grain of salt. My needs for the book were academic, and on that front, I found some chapters more useful and more rigorous than others. I think overall the volume is necessary for anyone studying global leadership, but from an academic perspective, you may be disappointed that some of the articles made the cut into the volume, i.e. weak theory, no theory, or low on rigor. From the perspective of a practicing manager, the same issue, but going the other way. I think a couple of the chapters may be useful and well written for an applied scenario, but I don't think the cost of the volume is worth the value a practicing manager would get out of this one. Final synopsis: we have a long way to go before we know what global leadership actually is. This volume certainly doesn't answer the question and may even make it more ambiguous."
1,Pathetic,"How this woman dares to still be in the public eye with her completely unproven nonsense is beyond me. The gullible public continue to line her pockets when she produces this trash. How dare she pretend she knows what happens in the afterlife, if there is one. This should be sold as fiction, or better still, given away to the weak gullible types who need crutches like this."
1,Animals on the Other Side,"this book is a total waste of money.this is written as a poor childrens book,that makes no sense.I used to be a fan of Sylvia Browne. I now consider her a joke and a very bad one at that.I used to watch her on Montiel Williams,now I will not watch the show."
1,Animals on the other side,Don't waste your money on this book. I thought it was not worth the money.It was a poor excuse for a book. I didn't get anything out of it. I actually would rate it a zero.
3,"Sylvia Brown....Still More Helpful than Jesus, at least.","You can say what you want about the self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Brown, but whatever you say, she offers comfort to people who happen to be absolutely terrified of death and dying (mostly because of the Bible telling them that if they do ANYTHING wrong, they risk the eternal fires of hell). You can call her a fake, a phony, and a storyteller, but I would argue that you could use the same adjectives to describe the authors of the Bible. The difference is, she portrays God to be loving and gentle and that no one ever suffers after they die. I personally would rather listen to her theories on the afterlife than to believe that God is the cruel, heartless individual he is portrayed as in the Bible. I prefer to think of a God is loving, not evil like the Christian version."
3,Animals on the other side - Sylvia Browne,"I have read ALL of Sylvia Browne's books. I was disappointed with this one, only because it did not indicate that it was a CHILDRENS BOOK. That would have been helpful in the description.Thank you."
3,It's a good children's book.,"Having bought five other Sylvia Browne books/cds in the past, I was quite interested in this book since I am a total animal lover, and I currently have a few cats and had one that might have already returned to The Other Side. This book is incredible underwritten as far as information is concerned. It's mostly simple drawings of landscapes and animals on The Other Side, and there's a small paragraph that describe the way the animals live and behave in every page. It took minutes to finish reading this book. If this book was as detailed as her others like Life On The Other Side or Past Lives, Future Healings, then it's more worthed the hardcover price. Nontheless, this book is ideal for children to read. It still made me feel a sense of relief that all my the pets I have had will be there waiting for me the minute I arrived Home again."
1,Disappointed,"I recently lost my beloved pet of 15 years and was looking for words of hope and comfort that one day I will get to see him again. I did not get that from this book. It was brief and I felt like I was reading a children's book. I received more comfort and hope from the paragraph I received about the Rainbow Bridge from the SPCA. I was very disappointed that the book was so short with very little detail. Normally Sylvia describes the afterlife and the ornate buildings and duties and way of life in great detail, so my expectations were high. I read this book cover to cover in about 5 minutes and came away angry that I wasted my money. I realize that afterlife may be a fantasy but in times of mourning, you are searching for anything that brings comfort and this book fell extremely short in that area."
5,Very Helpful After Death of Cat,"After the death of our pet cat, my child, who has autism, was helped by looking at this book. The pictures are very beautiful & show lots of different animals ""on the other side."" The picture of Jolie admiring the ""timeless architecture of Europe,"" is a favorite. One can imagine our cat next to Jolie on the steps by the fountain. Having a strong visual appeal, this book is a winner, and helped us explain our beliefs: concepts such as Heaven, Spirit/Soul & God (none which are specified in the book). Thank you for helping calm a saddened heart."
1,Comforting,"I bought 'Animals on the Other Side' because my dear beloved dog had passed on, and I was emotionally devastated. He had been very loving, and needed to be 'with' us every waking minute, and slept at the foot of our bed at night. I have no doubt that his soul lives on. I needed some kind of comfort that he was okay without us, tho. The book is written in such a way that a child could read and understand it, and I know that children can be just as grief stricken as adults when they lose a pet. The illustrations are beautiful and imaginative. The book brought to conscious thought my deep seated belief that animals are a direct link to heaven."
2,Animals on the Other Side,"This book is a picture book of which 7\8ths are illustrations and 1\8th is text. It is 14 pages long and took me 5 minutes to read. Had I known what it was I would not have purchased it unless it was on the dollar table. There was a bit of information and I do find Sylvias books about the other side to be deeply interesting however this one was disappointing for the price. Oh well, they got my money."
3,Animals on the other side,A book for children. and just sylvia Browne vision of what happened to her dog after it died. Provided opportunity for discussion of the possiblity the dog was living as a spiritual creature but left me with the difficult questions as to why a dog spirit would be interested in seeing or being in tourist spot around the world
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!,"I'm glad that I didn't pay a lot for this book because it was VERY DISAPPOINTING! I used to be a fan of Sylvia Browne's but after reading her description of Heaven as if she had been there and seen all the statues, etc., I lost all faith in her. I didn't realize this was a child's book when I ordered it, but children should only be told things like this in a fairy tale. I was not under the impression that Sylvia Browne's books were fictional. Now I wonder."
1,Animals On the Other Side,I have always been a fan of Sylvia Browne and have most of her books. I am rather disappointed in the deception in the promotion of this book. I have seen numerous plugs on the Montel Williams show about the forthcoming book. Never once did anyone say it would be a good read for a 3 year old. This book is obviviously written for children who have lost their pets. I literally read the book in less than 5 minutes. You could condense all topic content in one short paragraph. I have waited for 4 months to read this book since hearing about it and after enduring the loss on my beloved Shih Tzu. I was not expecting to be deceived.
1,Not a Good Book for Children....,"What was Sylvia Browne trying to do with this book? Is it really necessary to tell children that griffins and unicorns are real and go ""home"" when they die--and that we can telepathically communicate with them and other animals after we die and ""go home"", too? Browne would do well to remember the physician's oath, ""Do no harm"". This much-too-expensive 32 page book could upset and confuse children instead of helping them cope with loss. This is a transparent money-making venture, with no grounding in psychology. Definitely not recommended."
5,A Great Book for Children,"I purchased this book for my son who has many questions about the Other Side, especially about animals on the Other Side and what happens to them when they die. It is beautifully illustrated and explains the afterlife in simple terms for children. Well worth the money and a great help for parents and kids with a curiosty about life after death and the animals we love."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially being from Sylvia Browne. I was very disappointed. It only took about three minutes to go through this book. It was nothing like what I expected. Sylvia tells the audience that anyone with pets need to get this book, she should tell them it is more for children. Pictures were nice, didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. I feel I just threw my money away by buying this book. I should have read the ratings before buying it, I felt since Sylvia wrote it that it had to be worth buying. My cat was very ill and I was looking for something that would help me through her passing. Unfortunately this book wasn't it."
2,not that informative,I thought that it would tell you more about the place that animals go for children or even adults. I was not happy with this book. It is over priced. The pictures are nice though.
1,Horribly tacky design,Being a designer I was appalled at the layout and illustrations of this book. The type is set in screamingly large comic sans and the pastel illustrations look like they were done by a blind six year old. I got this for my mother thinking it was a legitimate book but found it was a picture book. I wish I could give this book less than one star.
4,should be part of every pet-loving child's and adult's library,"this book really helped me get over the loss of my beloved pet fish, Mr. Furious. Well, not ""get over""- those who've loved animals know there is no ""getting over"" the loss of a dearly departed pet. There is only solace in the good memories we have of them. I enjoyed this lovely book. It gave a very warm and hopeful portrait of the after life. I intend to buy a copy for myself and for my young niece who recently lost her favorite kitty. Sylvia is a terrific author!"
4,Animals on The Other Side,"Although this book was written for children, it will also be meaningful for adults. It's a must read for anyone that loves their pets and wonders if they will be reunited with them for eternity!!"
1,Save your money,"Like others have said, too bad I didn't read how many pages this book had. It is definitely not a book for an adult. It is more in line with a picture book for a child. I was VERY disappointed. Save your money and know that yes, fluffy is fine and on the otherside...enough said!!"
3,Animals on the Other Side,This is a delightful children's book and will go a long way to comfort a child when a pet dies. This book will also help inform adults that our pets really do have an afterlife.
3,Animals on the other side,"The picture were outstanding, but i was disappointed that Sylvia did not write a more lengthy book, I guess I did not realize that this book was more geared towards children. It did give me great comfort that one day I will be see all my animals and that they will greet me when I go HOME! I do absolutely love all her books, especially Angels, Prophecy, and Mother God."
4,Animals on the Otherside,"Wonderful information for children, it really puts their mind at ease about the death of their beloved pet. Though directed at an age group over five, parents can change some words but the pictures are vibrant and playful and leave a good mental image."
5,how it holds the sockets,"It had neat little fringes that old each socket in place, I have seen this ratchet set for sale on offroading webpages, thats what I bought it for. and to me it seems to hold them on well enough for the heaviest of offroading hits and it is very well constructed. The sockets will not fall out and mix in hte box like so many others so I say it is a good buy"
2,Arrived partly broken.,"I just received it today and have yet to use it, so this is more a review for Amazon.com than the product itself.One of the plastic thing hold the sockets in place with the cluster is broken.What's pissed me off is that Amazon was obviously aware of this damage, since a piece of tape was put on the socket to hold it inplace.While this does not affect the function of the tool itself, it almost entirely ruins the convenience for storage, as I have to store this one loose socket separately.One side note, from my observation, these plastic holders are probably not very durable."
2,"Exciting scenes, but hard to color","I have several of the new line of Star Wars coloring books, and this one is by far the biggest disappointment. Illustrator Scott Kolins faithfully recreates scenes from the movie, but has a heavy hand with dark, thick lines and shaded areas which leave less picture to color. And while I certainly don't demand that the characters be duplicate representations of the actors who depict them, it would be nice if Padme's lips actually looked humanoid. It's not a terrible book, but for the coloring buck your money is better spent on Jesus Redondo's fabulous Episode 1 books."
3,I've been reading this for awhile,"I love reading and am a fast reader. I can easily read 2-3 books per week.I keep putting this one down, in favor of other books.It's ok, but for some reason, it's not pulling me in.I'm not invested in it."
4,A fish story from start to finish,Dead Angler is a real fish story with a mystery thrown in. I learned more about fly fishing and muskey fishing than I ever needed to know. The author is a real fishing expert. She manages to mix fishing tips with murder and romance. I enjoyed the book and recommend it for mystery lovers.
4,Dead Angler (Loon Lake Fishing Mystery),Pretty good book and wasn't expensive to purchase for my Kindle. I love a book that has just a touch of romance and doesn't waste page after page on the subject. Quick read and interesting.
5,Loon Lake area,"My husband grew up in the general area of Loon Lake, so it is fun to see all the names of places around there--they are not fictitious. Always a very intriguing plot, also."
3,just okay,Not something I would want to read again. It's a shallow read. I guess if you are looking for an easy read that doesn't take much thought this book would be okay.
3,Interesting and entertaining read,"This is a who-done-it about a retired dentist, Paul Osborne. He is an avid fly fisherman, and the book has loads of detail of the sport, including picturesque settings in the streams and woods of Wisconsin, where Loon Lake of this entire series resides. Paul goes fishing with Loon Lake's Chief of Police, Lew Ferris and they wind up embroiled in solving a murder mystery.An interesting sleuth story unfolds, well told, but which left me wanting more. Perhaps it's just this genre that I am not so taken with. A worthwhile and entertaining read."
2,Boring,"While I liked retired dentist Paul Osborne, I failed to connect with him. Consequently, I didn't really care what happened to him and the rest of the characters, and I found myself skipping sections of the book. Perhaps I would have become more involved and enjoyed the book more if it had been written in the first person, rather than in third person. Also, I prefer that the protagonist in the books I read be female. Contrary to the cover blurb that indicates the female police chief is the protagonist, the real main character in this book is Paul Osborne. The female character is just an add-on.I do think readers who really, really enjoy fishing will like this book, as a great deal of time is spent with the characters engaged in fishing or talking about fishing or thinking about fishing."
4,Learning how to learn,Great book to accompany How to Study in College by Walter Pauk and Use your head - Tony Buzan.Great on concept idea map building and how we can learn better or more efficiently.
3,Not As Advertised,"There's nothing special about this cleaner. It's your ordinary, everyday household item. There was definitely no significant shine or cleaning magic."
1,Very Leaky,This cup is one of the most leaky products I have owned. I found a puddle inside of my diaper bag on one trip out of the house. I have tried one more time since then to use it. I tried doing a number of things to make the leaking stop and it wont. It is just plain Leaky.
2,a boring restatement of already know facts,"As I said, if you are a scholar of international law, don't expect to find anything in this book that you don't know already."
5,Great sensitivity!,"Received a positive at 12 dpo, which is around 4 days after I suspected implantation. Equivalent to FRER but much cheaper!"
5,Pleased,"Arrived very quickly, results were fast and clear! Was worried with such an inexpensive pack of tests that they would be low quality but the line came out just as dark as my 1st response test."
5,Inexpensive answers for the impatient!,"Have you ever bought a $5 pregnancy test at the store because your period was a few days late? And then felt stupid afterwards for wasting the money? And have you done this more than once? If so, these are the thing for you. We are not trying to concieve right now, but we're not really trying to avoid either. These tests are cheap enough that I don't feel wasteful taking one every month around the time my period is due. And it gives me peace of mind."
1,Sucks,These test definitely are not the wandfo brand. I tested with my urine and 13 test came back negative than I tested with mountain dew yes!!!!! Mountain dew and it came back positive right away. Yes they are cheap but are CRAP!!!!!!! DON'T wASTE your money
4,GREAT value!,"I co-run a student organized sexual health clinic at my university. We offer safer sex supplies (condoms, lube, dental dams, etc) and counciling services to our peers. We recently decided to try offering pregnancy tests. We had a really hard time finding them at non-profit prices until we found these! We were able to offer them for such a low price, and they went really quickly! It's hard to ask everyone what they thought because our services are strictly confidential, but so far, only good feedback! I tried one myself just to see what they were like so I could tell people we were offering them to, and my only complaint is that the instructions on the package are pretty unclear and caused me to have a major freak-out because I didn't wait long enough before I tried to read it. My only advice is to put it aside in a tissue for a good 15-20 minutes before coming back to it!"
5,Good,"I was able to test 3 days before my missed with a faint positive. I was a little unsure because it was faint, but it got darker and darker over the next few days. Great because so cheap so can test more frequently."
2,Pretty good,These are pretty good. I got them when they were expected to arrive. I guess I didn't need them after all but think I may need to order some more because I lost the ones I had. Getting 25 pregnancy tests for 10 dollars is better than only getting 1 for 10 dollars or more. All in all a good buy.
2,No early detection here,"I have been taking these tests since about 7-8dpo and nothing. I also tried dollar tree brand because their detection is low too 25miu and nothing. Finally at 10.5DPO I use a First Response Early Result and there it is my BFP. That was yesterday. I take another one of these tests today and still a BFN.So while I wish I can say these cheap ones work, (I really really do for the price)they are not picking up what the expensive brand does. And if your like me you want to know early well these just aren't cutting it."
1,Don't waste trying to save money!!,"I bought these after spending money on cb to at 7dpo tooooo early. I wish I had waited until now to take the cb cause these tests suck eggshells. I've known I was pregnant since day 1. I have had all symptoms: fatigue,bloat,gas,cramps,metallic taste,increase smell,change taste in food, increase temp, back pain, nausea, acid reflux, pulling sensations. Lol. I'm not kidding. I am now 3 days late. Every test has been neg except the last two today that have dents where the + is supposed to be. There is a very very very faint line on them. What is the actual sensitivity of these tests? Who knows. They certainly don't care they have my money!!! What a bunch of loser as people that created this garbage!!! Arrrrrrrrgggggghhhhh!!!!!!"
2,Overall OK- but one false positive,"I like to use these because they are inexpensive and are accurate. This week, though, I did have one false positive, which was very upsetting. I had a very faint line with color, which was similar to the first line I had with my last pregnancy (which ended in miscarriage). I was so excited and tried a few other tests- all negative. I looked online and others have complained of this very thin line being a false positive. It is upsetting to think you are pregnant and then find out you are not!"
1,Product Not What I Expected,"The tests that I received from this seller, were different from the ones I ordered on Amazon. The picture shows the pink handle Wondfo, and they sent me the skinny blue handle tests that are High Sensitivity. In other words, they do not ship the advertised product and did not specify anywhere that they would send something different than advertised. The skinny blue handle, High Sensitivity Wondfo are not as good as the regular strips with the pink handle that says HCG on them. Those are able to detect HCG in the urine a lot sooner than the High Sensitivity ones.Additionally, the package looked like something packaged and sent out of someone's house, not a health company. Made me feel I did not buy from a reputable seller. I just re-ordered new Wondfo test strips from Formosa and Spuer Medical Supplier and the packaging looks more legit. Additionally I received the product advertised and not something else."
5,Great,Great service and good product. Arrived on time when promised. Very pleased with order and very prompt. Will use again in the future
2,Did not work!,"I was 5 days late and I took 15 of these throughout the 5 days, all were negative!.... I finally went to drug store to buy a real test and found out I WAS pregnant.... Do not buy!"
3,BUYER BEWARE -- YOU WON'T BE GETTING WONDFO,"I ordered these and what arrived looks nothing like the product online. I ended up with something called ""Clinical Guard"" in blue packets. This is disturbing because I didn't order Clinical Guard. I only ordered the Wondfo brand based on the rave reviews. I double checked my order history to be sure I didn't make a mistake and the Wondfo is what's there -- not any Clinical Guard. BUYER BEWARE -- they're doing a bait and switch without any explanation. I am inquiring with Amazon about this matter. Just thought you should know and maybe hold off on your purchase."
5,Never use antyhing else again,"I don't know why people would pay so much money for a piece of plastic surrounding the strip. These are super easy to use. Just pee in a cup and then, dip the strip and watch it change. It's really effective and so much cheaper than the other pregnancy tests. It's even easier to just pee in a cup than try to aim and pee on a stick.The fact that you're going to pay only $5 for 25 strips is a deal! However, if you're like me and found out that you're pregnant with the first strip and the other 24 strips expire in two years, I just passed the other strips out to other friends TTC."
1,Wondfo false faint positives,"Wondfo's gave me several faint positive test, they were pink but were more like evaporation line..... all other test brand showed a negative. the line never got darker but you could clearly see it was there... heartbreaking."
5,BFP 8dpo,"Great hpt! Got a faint but clear positive at 8 dpo. The next day I tested again and the line was slightly darker and also got a positive on a FRER and a ClearBlue digital. Being the Type A hormonal woman I am, I continued to test every day or every other day and the test line got progressively darker until it was darker than the control line. On BFN cycles the strips were stark white where the test line would be. I highly recommend these to test early for accurate results!"
3,Lots of evap lines,"These tests are super affordable, which deserves a big thumbs up. But I've had a problem with evap lines. My last couple of cycles have been longer than average, so I would take a test in hopes of finding out I was pregnant. When a faint, but very clear second pink line would show up, I'd get excited, only to be disappointed when one of my more expensive digital tests came up negative. I'd say nearly 40% of the tests I've used have had this happen."
1,False positives--beware!,"This is a false positive I got with these tests. Two more taken the next day were negative. I wouldn't trust these tests unless you confirm a positive with another brand. Don't think I will be buying them again...The line appeared within the 10min time limit and was pink, so despite being faint, it is by definition positive.I'm posting a link to babycenter.com because I don't know how else to add the picture.(...)"
3,fun but you end up going to buy the real thing anyway.,"Here's the thing. Its fun to take these tests. How exciting to find out if there is a chance you might be having a new addition. You can test several times a day! BUT When you get a positive and then take another one that is negative, you are going to be sending your husband to the store (sometimes late at night:) to get a real test. Any pregnancy test that will give you a false positive is very very heart-breaking. So if you are in a frame of mind that can handle this, enjoy. If not, don't buy these."
1,Not as pictured.,The items have pink handls instead of blue as pictured. From the other reviews seems like the pink ones are regular test strips and the blue ones are early detection ones.Disappointing.Seller needs to change the item picture to reflect actual items being sold.1 star for quick shipment.
2,You get what you paid for,"After my period was late, I would use these every day to see if I was pregnant. For five days straight it read negative. On the sixth day there was a very slight pink line indicating positive. I ended up buying EPT to get additional results and there it was a BIG FAT POSITIVE. So there you have it. Even after my period was DAYS late it didn't read pregnant. Keep this in mind."
1,Tons of False Positives,"Like others stated, you will get lots of false positives on these tests. Some were truly evaps as they didn't show up until after the 5 minute mark but 9 out of the 17 I used had clear, pink second lines that showed up around 3-4 minutes.If you can deal with the fact that the test might not be accurate and back up cheapie tests with reliable ones, then the Wondfos should be okay. But if you have been trying for a long time or will feel heartbroken over a false positive, don't bother."
1,Not Really Wondfo...and False Positives!!,"I ordered this product because (a)It's titled Wondfo (b)the picture depicts the pink handled wondfo test stripsI don't usually leave reviews but I thought this was important enough for me to say something. I ordered these, and yes they are cheap and yes they came fast. THESE ARE NOT WONDFO TEST STRIPS. These are Clincal Guard. I got 5 false positives from the Clincal Guard test strips, which are super skinny blue handled hcg strips. Upon talking with some women on my TTC website, I was informed from several women that the same thing happened to them with the same brand and style test. SO BUYER BEWARE!!! I have re-ordered from another listing on here that says from Wondfo and they really are the pink handled Wondfo's. I love Wondfo's...so do try those. Do not buy from Clincal Guard unless you want your heart broken like mine was."
2,The tests were all duds,"I ordered the strips along with ovulation strips. The ovulation strips worked great and helped us get pregnant, but when I missed my period and tested with the pregnancy strips they kept coming out negative, even 4 days beyond my longest luteal phase (testing with 2 strips a day). We finally purchased another brand test and it came out positive."
1,"not a reliable product, just doesn't work","I was showing all the signs of early preg, i.e., skipped period, nausea, exhaustion. These cheapo tests were still coming up negative three days past when I would have expected my period. I started to question whether the tests were accurate and so I went out to buy a regular pregnancy test. First Response came up positive 3 days past my missed period, as you'd expect a pregnancy test to do! and I have no doubt if I'd used them the previous day or the day before, it would have shown me a + result then, too.To test whether it was just a matter of my hormone levels increasing, I then went back and tested again with a cheapo. Still negative, 4 days past the time when my period was due. Not a recommended product for this reason. Buy a good test; these guys seem like a good buy but they just don't work."
2,False negatives for me,"On 14 dpo, I tested with these as well as with First Response. First Response showed a slight line and two of the wondfo's showed absolutely nothing. We were a little confused and didn't know what to think. On day 15, I tested with the digital clearblue easy and it said ""pregnant"" which I was. The Wondfo's did not work at all when they should have."
5,Positive result at 9dpo,"I am a pee on a stick junkie! I started testing 2 days after I ovulated. 7 days later, got my first positive result! I'm elated, but here's the issue:""False positives"" are often not that at all. It's not a defective test. Up to 70% of pregnancies result in 'chemical pregnancies', which are actually very early miscarriages. Many women have this happen without even knowing it because it looks just like a normal period, and happens around the same time. So that 'false positive' is more likely an early pregnancy that was lost. I mention it because a lot of negative reviews are centered on the false positive phenomenon, and it's probably not that at all.So, while I am elated that this test was positive, considering we've only been trying for one cycle, I won't be celebrating until probably 8 weeks along when the highest change of chemical pregnancy has passed."
5,"very sensitive, i got my first BFP at CD 23","Fast shipment, test are very sensitive, i got my firls faint BFP on CD 23, but i could not believe it, i was thinking it was an evap line. So i was testing every day, and each day the line comes faster and darker. It takes time tough for them to become dark, i was testing at cd 30 it was stil light line and got really nice and dark cd 32-33I test with other brand on CD 28 and i got very blight ine right away.So cd 29 i went to for a blod test and it was neg!!! i could not belive it!!So i went to get another blod test at cd 30 and my beta was only 33. So this test are so sensitive that they detect hCG before the blod test!!"
1,Did not recieve Wondfo Brand,I ordered these after previously using the brand and being satisfied. I received the same style tests but they were manufactured by clinical guard. These tests did not work. They hardly picked up the HCG after my ovidrel shot let alone when testing for pregnancy. At 14dpo I finally went out and bought 2 Answer brand tests which immediately turned positive. I would make sure when buying these your receive the correct brand.
5,Simple + Usage Warning,"These pregnancy tests are extremely easy and simple to use. Each test comes individually wrapped. I don't know why I'd ever go back to complicated plastic encased tests when these are so much cheaper with the same results. If it matters to you, the dye on these is pink, which I personally find easier to read than blue. I've never had an issue with evaporation lines. Results are always clear and easy to read.**Update!** While I still love these tests, I thought I would add something from personal experience. Follow the instructions and always dip the tests in your urine and do not go above the marked line. If you urinate on the tests or get them wet around the dye strip, you'll get a false positive. Not an evap line. A nice, pink, must be positive line- only you're not pregnant- just stupid for not following directions! So use these correctly!"
1,Warning about thin lines/false positives!,"I recently ordered these after using Wondfo w/ tremendous success in the past. They were always sensitive and never gave false positives or evaps. This batch was my first experience with the pink handled Wondfo strips, so maybe that has something to do with it. Out of a pack of 25 Wondfo strips, 4 of them had obvious pink lines almost immediately, and all 4 were beta-confirmed false positives. I got 3 before the beta (one the day of); the 4th came AFTER my beta with hCG confirmed at zero. I should note that these lines are thinner than the control, like the dye is pulled to one side. (This is the same type of line many of the cheaper blue-dye tests tend to give). I suspect those with thicker pink lines should be a great deal more hopeful!"
5,Very Sensitive!,"I used this at 12DPO (4 days before period was due) and got a faint positive. I had a blood test the next day that gave a result of 20hcg, which means this most likely had shown positive with around 15hcg (or at least under 20!). For my positive result showing with that low of hcg, I did have to wait almost the full time it says to wait - I think it was 5 minutes on the directions, and the 2nd line didn't show up until 3.5 minutes. I tested the following few days (why not... I had a whole pack of them!) and it gradually showed up earlier and earlier."
3,Great for confirming.,"Great for confirming a pregnancy after your missed period. If you are trying to test before you have actually missed a period I would spend the money and buy FRER. With three pregnancies, I have not tested positive on a WONDFO test until several days past missed period (FRER tested positive 4-5 days before missed period)."
1,FAIL!,"These don't work, at least for me. Even when I did get a positive digital test it was still negative. They are cheap for a reason, dysfunctional and I'll never waste even the $5.00 I spent on them ever again."
4,"Cheap, but not as sensitive as I thought it'd be.","I thought the Wondfo's were supposed to be very sensitive. According to the instructions, however, you're supposed to wait until I believe a day after your missed period to expect a positive. They're still cheap enough to test early, but you can't be discouraged by an early negative. I wish they would be clear in the listing that these are not the Wondfo Early Test Strip, but in fact these are likely Wondfo Onestep Test.Also, the different color handles are so confusing. I bought this same listing twice. I first received the plain pink handles, and the next one I received pink with HCG on the handle."
4,Inexpensive and practical.,"Does what it's supposed to do. Inexpensive and practical. If you always want to pee on something as early as possible, this is for you."
2,"Cheap for the pee stick addict, but evap line","I was very exited to try these test after the rave reviews given on a trying to conceive website. I've tried early pregnancy tests, baby wishes and have loved them both but thought heck, I'll give these a try.Easy to use, instructions are simple, YET every single test I took from 7dpo-13dpo gave a faint pink line and I was NOT pregnant. I even backed it up with name brand tests the same day and other internet cheapie tests. None of the other tests showed even a hint of a line. I don't know if I got a bad batch of tests or if this is the case for all of these. Regardless, I will not be purchasing these again. If you don't want to get your hopes up, I suggest you don't purchase them either."
5,sensitive and accurate,I was able to find out that I was pregnant before any of the drugstore test kits claim you can get a positive - well before a missed period. Sensitive and reliable.
4,Very easy to use,"These were so easy to use, and the price point was amazing. My sticks were packaged and labeled as Wondfo.I filled a cup, dipped the stick in for a few seconds, pulled it out and stared. When my stick finally detected HCG, the control line was dark immediately... the second line was rather faint, but it was definitely there. Because the sticks were so cheap, I used about 12 over 3 days to be sure of what I was seeing.A very inexpensive solution, and I got my results in a matter of minutes."
2,1 day AFTER missed period!,"I got these thinking they'd be a cheap way for me to test before period is due, but the packaging says it can detect it 1 day after missed menses. Sucky."
3,Productr great but shipping took forever!!!,"So, these work fine and I think they are a good value for the money. However, it took well over two weeks to receive them. Since they didn't arrive in time I had to buy some at Wal-Mart (another $12 down the drain), So, I would suggest that if you want to use these any time soon you order them now because they will take awhile to arrive. Also, they are much smaller and flimsy than over the counter sticks so buy some little dixie cups to use as a specimen holder. Otherwise you ruin the test or you make a mess. Either way, not good."
2,False positive,"I got a positive test... went to the drug store to buy a first response pack to confirm. Those were NEGATIVE the next morning. I'm very late on my period, and tend to have irregular or no period, so I like to test if I am pregnant often so I don't endanger the fetus' health.. I took another one of this brand morning and it was negative. So I'm really confused. Apparently if you read outside the window you can get false positives, or maybe over submerge the strips? Dunno!!"
3,Too many Evaporation Lines,"I was not very happy with this product, the price was ok for what I got. I got a visible colored evaporation line of every test that I used before the 5 minute mark. Even after I started my period, I used one to see if there was a difference, but no change still got the exact same evaporation line. I don't think I will buy these again, especially after speaking with many other women who had the same problem recently with these tests."
5,Cheap & Wonderful!,"I have been TTC for 6 months and used all sorts of pregnancy tests. I wish I would have ordered these from the beginning! They came fast, and they sure as heck work. I got a faint positive at 8 dpo, with night urine and all! They just keep getting stronger and stronger. I couldn't get either of my other brands of dip strips to turn at all! I thought I had a bad batch number, and when I emailed the seller they responded right away and said if any of the tests were defective to send them back for a replacement or a refund. Thank goodness I didn't have to! My EDD is December 20th :)"
1,False faint positive,I decided at 4 dpo to just try out one of my sticks. Well what do you know the test showed a faint bfp which is crazy. I'm upset to have purchased so many that can't be trusted.
5,"Accurate, easy to use and inexpensive!","With pregnancy tests selling for upwards of $10 apiece in the stores, this is a real bargain. The tests are simple to use and the results are easy to interpret."
5,I LOVE THESE!,"I am obsessed with taking pregnancy tests. I can't help myself. I have had two losses in the past, so testing to ""check if i'm still preg is really important to me"". I am pregnant again and it has been so wonderful and reassuring to see the test line darken every day! I am five weeks this time and the test line is darker than the control line! These are very accurate and I got a positive 9 dpo!These are the best!"
4,Very Sensitive Tests,"I started getting a faint positive one day before my missed period and then had a blood test the next day with an HCG level of 5. Very low. Probably not a viable pregnancy, but these tests detected that low level. I wonder if some of the lower reviewers had very early chemical pregnancies- not false positives....Update- it is possible to get false positives as well- a false positive will be a thin line. For it to be an early, but true positive, the test line needs to be as thick as the control line."
3,Faulty Batch,"I just want to let anyone who has batch # W00120979-3. This batch is faulty!! I took several tests and received a negative result every single time. I was suspicious that it was not accurate, so I purchased 6 additional tests from the store and sure enough they were all positive. Even my digital test was positive. I purchased these in bulk to save money and it ended up costing me a bunch more. I know Wondfo is a good brand but sometimes they do have faulty batches. My ovulation test strips worked fine though, just not these pregnancy strips."
1,False NEGATIVE. Urgh.,"I am a POAS fiend so these are naturally perfect because I can use a crap load and not feel guilty. Well, the problem is that they arn't sensitive enough detect a pregnancy until a WEEK after a missed period. Um, that is soooo not okay when you are trying to get pregnant. I relied on these to tell me if I was..and a couple days after my missed period I felt like something was amiss so I took a ""real"" test (First Response) and it was a big fat positive and these cheapos were still negative. So as a test I kept taking them every day to see when it would actually turn positive and exactly a week after my missed period I got a faint line. Lame.I've heard good things about those dollar store tests so I would recommened getting another type of cheap test and skip these unless you are really patient and want to wait...bleh."
1,FALSE POSITIVES!!! Do not buy!,First of all these are ClinicalGuard tests not Wondfo tests. I thought I was pregnant for 4 days because of evaporation lines that showed up during the time frame. Even my husband was convinced I was pregnant from looking at the tests himself. I finally tested with another brand and I in fact was not pregnant. Save yourself a heartache and buy another brand. Ive used other cheap HPT's like this (sold by Formosa LLC on Amazon) and have never had a problem with them until I got these.UPDATE: I did send an email to the seller and they refunded me for the product very quickly although I will not by from this seller again. I also added a picture of my false positive and you can clearly see it is not the test strip pictured in the description.
4,Worked for me,Overall I think these tests work pretty well! Only two out of twenty-five looked like there was a positive line right out of the package. After having some preggers symptoms I started testing at 6dpo and it was a bfn. I even tried to see if I could look for the tiniest bit of line but it was stark white. At 8 dpo I started seeing a tiny line and day 9 it got stronger. If it wasn't for the two tests that looked positive before I even tested I would have given 5 stars.
5,reliable and accurate,this is our 3rd cycle trying and i was feeling kinda funny around 9DPO and had a temp drop then back up the day before so i tested and got a very faint positive at noon on 9DPO!! i am now 12DPO and have confirmed using FRER and CBE digi and go for bloodtest tomorrow but this so far has working perfectly for me and for a great price..
3,Be sure to read the package,"Make sure you look at the package when you receive it. I had one batch that accounted any double lines as pregnant (good!). The second batch I bought declared a faint 2nd line as a negative (annoying!), and a bold 2nd line as positive (hmm...how bold is bold??). Too confusing for a woman trying to get pregnant if you ask me!"
1,All Duds - except one that had 3 lines!,"I've always used name/store brand pregnancy tests, but after finding these thought it would be great to be able to get so many so cheap! I was extremely disappointed! All except 1 were duds not even showing a faint line, and some with a control line so faint I could hardly see it.Except for one single test that showed 3 lines!! Yes 3 and anyone who has ever used a pregnancy test knows they are supposed to only have a pregnancy line & a control line - this test had what seemed to be 2 perfectly formed pregnancy lines and one slightly darker control line. Neat I must say, but still why did all the others say negative when only one said positive?? I took at least 8 more after the 3 line test with all negatives....Needless to say I will go back to the brands I trust for future use."
5,Accurate and Cheap!,"I received the tests with the solid pink handle, but I'd imagine they are the same..... My partner and I have been trying to conceive since February so each month I would get impatient and take 1 or 2 tests before my period was even due. Each month these tests came back clearly negative. There was no question about it, and they are very easy to read. This month, I finally received a BFP! Out of 25 tests I didn't have a single bad test, 22 showed Negative when I was not pregnant, and 3 showed Positive and I am indeed pregnant. One thing I also noticed was that when the test is positive the pink starts to lift up on the handle, I compared these to the negative tests I had taken earlier and the pink handle was secure... Maybe that was just a weird coincidence, but it happened with all 3 of my positive tests. I highly recommend these tests, why waste money on the expensive ones when these will tell you sooner?"
1,wrong brand pregnancy test,"ordered wondfo pregnancy test, but didn't get that. instead got a different brand. not sure if they work yet, but still unhappy"
2,Hard to see + on Wondfo test strips,"I purchased these test strips during our 2nd IVF cycle. On December 21st we had three top quality embryos transferred. I began testing on December 25th. On December 29th I decided to try a first response after having a - test strips. The first response was positive, I used the same urine to check the test strip and it was -. I later checked the test strip and you can see what looks like an evap line. December 30th, I use a clearblue digital and sure enough +, so I check the strips again with the same urine and the same evap looking line appears. So, for $6.00 I cant complain, you definately get what you pay for. However, if I had continued using just the test strips I would not know I was pregnant so soon. Granted 11dpo is early."
3,"Prone to False Positives, but the price can't be beat","These tests are super cheap, and for that reason alone, I would recommend them for women who feel the need to test frequently. However, these tests are prone to false positives. I also once got the same distinct, thin line false positive that other reviewers have mentioned. When I followed up with another Wondfo test and a First Response test later that day and the next morning, all were clearly negative. Perhaps I had a chemical pregnancy but I doubt that my HCG levels could have dropped that quickly.I can think of no explanation why the test malfunctioned. The false positive came out of the blue after at least 10 other negative tests in other cycles, which further caused me to get my hopes up.I think the tests are useful for what they are--a way to keep from wasting money by testing on more expensive and more accurate tests--but anyone who buys these tests needs to know that the results need to be confirmed with another brand of test."
3,They are great for obessesive testers,"I have bought these before and I have used at least 5 of them. The test line is not that dark and I have used Answer, 1st response and clear blue digital and gotten ""pregnant"" and way darker lines. I am 18 days past ovulation, so I am a little surprised I am still not getting darker lines. Clear blue has a higher sensitivity. Maybe its just me, I do still like how cheap and convenient they are."
5,NEVER BUY EXPENSIVE TESTS AGAIN!!!,I have wasted so much money on expensive pregnancy tests and none of them detect pregnancy as early as these do! I took one of these tests at 10DPO and it showed up positive and I took a ClearBlu digital as well and it was negative. The clearblu didn't show up positive until 12DPO. These work great and you just can't beat $8 for 25 tests!!!
3,Only 90% accurate,"I bought this pack with 25 strips and I used the first 8 strips when I already got a BFP but want to continue POAS so these worked great. Sadly, that pregnancy turned into miscarriage and the next time we TTC again, I used up the remaining strips and 2 of them came back with false positives. As soon as I saw what I thought was 2 lines positive, I used the same urine and dip in another strip and would see a BFN. The tests were read within the specified time frame and weren't expired."
3,Test of Patience,"I don't think I would purchase these pregnancy test strips again. They may be cheap, but I got several false positives using these. They got my hopes up... only to find that I wasn't pregnant. I'd rather spend a little more money and get the straight facts."
2,Maybe should rate this higher...but,"This product might work just fine, but the sensitivity of the test is not included in the directions (nor on the amazon site except in reviews). I bought similar strips made in Canada that had that information easily accessible online.I'll go with them next time.I have no idea the the sensitivity of this product, and I specifically want to test early.The package is green--that's a plus."
1,False Positive..,"Just got these this morning, opened the package right up and used with FMU. Period is a month overdue. It showed what we believed to be a positive result, but upon looking at custumer uploaded images, I see it was a false positive. The line was VERY dark, but was lower down on the strip than where it should have been, it appeared soon after taking the test, so it wasn't an evaporation line. After TTC#1 for 2 1/2 years my heart is broken. I'm not sure if I'll be taking the rest of these tests."
4,Do the job,"These are fine, they do the job and you get a lot for cheap. That's about it for this product."
1,Buyer Beware,"My husband and I just started TTC our last baby. After using ICs to detect my last two pregnancies, I figured that these were a safe buy. Wrong. Instead of getting the ones pictured with the light pink blank handle, I received ones with dark pink handles with HCG written all over it. These tests are horrible. They're impossibly small and hard to hold. They take FOREVER to process. But the worst part is that they're ambiguous. I got what looked like a faint positive on one, only to get a negative on another with the same urine sample. I've been using two tests at a time, every morning, and one test will pop up with a faint line and the other one will be negative.Instead of saving me some money on this TTC journey, I now have to go buy a more reliable test from a store. These are going in the garbage and if I ever need to order HPTs again, it will NOT be these."
4,Easier to use than I thought,"As I haven't had these long or been pregnant yet, I can't be certain as to the accuracy of these tests. I do have some ClearBlue digital tests on hand to confirm any positives I may get, as I was the unfortunate victim of a false pos in the past with another brand of test.What I can say is they are a lot easier to use than I thought they would be, I hesitated and must have spent more money than I'd like to admit on midstream tests thinking they would be less mess. Not so. These are actually less messy in my opinion and by using cups, you can immediately confirm results without waiting. This is especially good for using FMU.The cost can't be beat either. I'm a very impatient woman and can test as much as I want without spending a fortune. I can save the more expensive ones only to confirm positives and a neg result only costs like $0.60 vs $6+ per test."
2,Very Dissapointed with these,Ok I must say with all the great reviews on this product I thought I would give it a try.. well I ordered 50 tests .. yep 50.. and here is where my problem with these come in.. seriously half of these were positive and half negative... like the same day I would get 2 entirely different answers.. so I gave up I went into my doctor.. to get a conformation.. the blood test was negative.. now I would not have been so surprised but that morning I got two positives..I am soo disappointed.. what a waist of money
4,"Wondfo Pregnancy Test Strips, 25-count",Super easy to use. For such a good value you can use as many times as you want! Highly recommended.
2,Yes cheap....,"Yes, these are cheap. But they aren't particularly sensitive. I got negatives with this test for two days when both First Response and Clear Blue Digital were coming up positive. When they finally did test positive they were so light they were barely readable. Took being a week after my period for them to really register."
1,BEWARE OF FALSE POSITIVES!!!!!,"I have been TTC for 4 months and was elated to get a positive test after about 30 seconds! I couldn't believe it, so I repeated the test several more times, all negatives! I feel bad for anyone having to be on this roller coaster of getting your hopes up only to get them crushed. I would stay away from these tests!!!!!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,These tests are not good for a woman who is TTC!! Be ready for an emotional roller coaster if you want to keep/track your tests .. these are terrible for evap lines. It seems that you MUST read the results in 5 min or you could get a false positive. Not worth the emotional toll!!
1,False Positives!!,"I don't know if I got a bad batch but imagine how I felt when day after day, test after test came up positive. Just to confirm my good news I tested with dollar store band which was negative and then first response which was also negative......what a major let down!! I thought to myself maybe this one was more sensitive and maybe I had a chemical pregnancy after AF showed up. So I decided to give it another go and the same thing happened the next 2 months.I dont think I would repurchase these tests, you get so excited only to be let down in the end. I would advise against getting these. TTC is already emotionally draining, this only aggravates things even more."
4,Early Accuracy & Cheap!,"Don't be turned off by the simple test construction or packaging. These dip-urine tests get the job done with no mess and much earlier than expected!Using a pee cup was actually easier than manuvering for a good angle (minus the possible splashing too!) and from the day of conception, I got a positive 10 DAYS later!!There was no confustion either, with a negative on Tues and a light(but easy to discern) line on Thursday and Friday, I knew I was pregnant!! For fun I plan I using more until I get a real dark line hehe.I reccomend using these in conjunction with the Wondfo ovulation test strips and with the price for the amount, you can't go wrong!"
1,Horrible,"These tests are absolutely HORRIBLE! 5 false positives, 4 negatives, 2 evaps, all in a matter of 3 days! I will NEVER, EVER be buying these again! HORRIBLE! Also wanted to add I should've been sent the PINK handled tests since the BLUE's are no longer being used (due to HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RATES/EVAPS!) but I was sent the BLUE ones!"
4,"Works well, great price","I discovered I was pregnant using these strips. They are much more cost-effective than most drug store tests and, as far as I can tell, work well."
4,Good and cheap,"I bought these tests last month and then read the reviews and was not happy so I bought the blue sticks from early pregnancy tests.com.Just tested yesterday and the blue sticks from EPT.com gave super faint line that could hardly be seen where these tests (pink) the line was definately darker!!! I would recommend these tests to anyone who likes to test. It is a great deal, easy to use, and super sensitive. I tested 12 days past ovulation and got the positive."
4,As fast as more expensive drug store tests!,"Great test strips for people like me who are anxious to know the result and want to test like crazy. With such a great price I could test daily after ovulation without wasting a lot of money. I got a faint (but distinguishable) positive at 10 days post ovulation, the same day as the more expensive first response test. Only downside is the strip isn't the best for sharing with family."
4,Great Tool for early care,"A little hard to read, but works great for me. I had an etopic pregency and I need to know Asap for preventive measure. Only downside is founding out early and losing it."
5,accurate and cheap,I wasn't expecting to get a positive test so early on anything but these gave me a positive 2 days before my period was due
1,Did Not Work!,"I used this product and it didn't work! I read reviews they detect early pregnancies but they didnt even work when I was over a week late for my period. I tried using them and thought I wasn't pregnant. I was confused that I didnt get my period. I used 3 within a week period (all on different days and in the morning) and they all had the same result, negative. Then a few days later when I still didnt get my period I tried a store brand pregnancy test and it was positive. The next morning I tried to used the strip again and it still came back negative. I wouldnt waste your time or money on this product!"
1,Gave me false positives,"I am unsure what is going on with the wondfo tests lately, but I am not the only one who got a false positive with this brand. I had two tests that I took that showed a faint pink test line within 3 minutes of testing (test calls for you to read within 5 minutes). It was there as clear as could be but when I tested with a more expensive brand of hpt they were negative. A few days later my cycle started. I don't know if there are bad batches out there but I will not get this brand again, it completely crushed me to see that second pink line pop up in the testing time and it be a lie."
2,"Claim to be ""Wondfos"" but I'm not sold","I have been ordering Wondfo strips from amazon for months and never had any issues. I ordered these, which were the slowest batch I've ever received, only to find that they were ""ClinicalGuard Early Response Pregnancy Tests"". I've read reviews on here before where people purchased Wondfo's and received other products instead but it never happend to me until now. I contacted the seller and they replied that the strips are manufactured by Wondfo but they put them in their own packaging.. I just don't believe it. Buyer be ware and read reviews. Not sure how I could have avoided this since they are clearly advertising them as Wondfo's but thought I'd post anyway for you all to consider."
5,EASY TO SEE PROGRESSION!,These strips worked great! I tested positive days before my missed period and other expensive digital tests wouldn't even pick up my hcg levels yet. You can clearly see the second line gradually darken as each day passes =) Early on I had one strip have an evaporation line (super skinny pink line) but when you really are pregnant it lets you know! It is a thicker pink line (even if it is fainter than the control initially). I would buy these again. I never felt guilty using too many.
1,4 False positives,"I have used wondfo often in the past and never had a problem. The last two batches I have purchased, I got two very clear positives from each batch. The only problem is I keep finding out I am not pregnant. One of my close friends has also been getting false positives on a recently purchased batch. I will no longer be buying these as its quite heart breaking and frustrating to get all excited after seeing two lines not once but twice and finding out there will be no baby. I thought it was just bad luck the first time but now that i got burned again, I'm done with this brand. Hope this saves someone some heartache."
1,False Hopes and Positives,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon. My husband and I started trying to conceive this year, and I purchased these strips because the deal seemed too good to be true. It was. I tested for four days in a row before starting a new cycle. Each day, I had one positive and one negative. Some days I had two positives. Then I used name brand tests to back up the results of these ones, and all name brands gave me negative results. Alas, I am not pregnant. The false positive is supposed to be rare; they are not so rare with these tests. I would not recommend buying these to anyone, and I will not buy them again. I'd rather buy the $1 tests from the dollar store than purchase these. They gave me a terrible emotional rollercoaster. Buyer beware!"
5,Positive on 19th day after the conception,"I want to share this with all who wishes to know how soon you can find out if you are pregnant or not with this strips. In my case, it took 19 days after the conception. 1/26/2011 - only day my husband and I made love. I had been testing several different days with CVS hometest kit and Wondfo strips to double make sure when I can find out the first day of positive result. I tested on 2/13/2011, but the test came out as negative. 2/14/2011 - the 1st day of positive result on both CVS hometest kit and Wondfo strips. I hope this information will help y'all."
1,You get what you pay for,"I was on the TTC journey and had heard wonderful things about this product. I got 25 of them and started to use them at 9dpo, when I started to show pregnancy signs. BFN all the way up to 12 dpo. I had a left over FRER from the month before, so I used that and got my BFP within seconds. As of 15 dpo, the Wondfo has just started to show a very very faint line that can only be seen when tilted a certain way and it took nearly 5 minutes for it to show. I don't recommend these to anyone unless you really are addicted to POAS."
4,Simple and easy to use,"These tests are simple, easy to use, and cheap. I used them a few times to check for pregnancy. The month I actually got pregnant, I ordered them on Amazon and as soon as I dipped the test it showed positive 3 weeks after conception. I thought there must be a mistake because I wasn't expecting to get pregnant that specific month. I tried another one of these strips and as soon as I dipped it was positive within the second! I read negative reviews here and thought I got a defective batch. I then purchased two tests from Duane Reade - one digital - brought them home and they were positive too. I am happily pregnant and can say that these tests work! Its always best to confirm with a different test, but these do work and can be used regularly."
3,These Don't Get Very Dark,"This brand picked up my positive 15 days past ovulation, for me it was two days before my missed period.On the same day I used the ""Answer"" brand and it was a lot darker than the Wondofo brand.I used my urine from first thing in the morning and it came up negative, in the afternoon I did it again and it turned positive. That's when I pulled out my digital and got a darker line with the digital. When I did another Wondofo test a few days later it was still faint while the digitals were darker.This brand didn't pick up way before any other, it picked up at the same time and it offered faint lines."
4,"Great for early detection, but not progression","These tests are great for early detection and for people that like to POAS constantly. However, if you want to continue using them for progression I would be leery. I would randomly get a test or two that had lines WAY lighter than the day before and then I would freak out, only to take a different brand and see that it was darker.Did give me faint BFPs at 7dpo last month (chemical) and 9dpo this month."
5,Best Pregnancy Tests Available,"For the past 5 months I was convinced these tests just wouldn't ever work...all I ever saw was a big blank spot where a 2nd like would be. But since I had 25 of them I figured I'd keep using them until they were gone before investing in FRERs. So imagine my surprise this month when I decided to test on Father's day, a few days before my missed period, and low and behold the tests do work! The line came up very clear in less than one minute. Naturally it wasn't as dark as the control line, I was only 11 DPO, but there was no squinting required! The next morning I got a FRER and a $ store test and tested with each of those in addition to the Wondfo and the Wondfo came up clearer, earlier and darker. I highly recommend these tests if you like to test often!"
5,Ecletic Institute Dandelion Leaf,"I have used Dandelion Leaf for a number of years. It is an herbal diuretic, which lowers blood pressure. I use this product in conjunction with another product and no longer need to take BP meds. I have noticed absolutely no side effects with this product."
4,Great Christian Rock... Not For Everyone,"As I was surfing amazon I came across this album. I was in need of some christian rock... seeing as it is in short supply. This album is great, I most rock fans could enjoy this album. Some songs are better than others but for the most part every song is different and as its own appeal.The Difference and Faith Like That really stand out in my mind. These two songs are great reminders of what being a christian is all about."
4,It's sad that this music doesn't sell,"Christian bands are such a living sacrifice. This record, though not perfect, happens to be one of the best of the past couple of years, and yet it falls short of the majority of ears simply because it's religious. I wish people would listen to what Kanye West talks about in ""Jesus Walks"" and start to play good music regardless of its lyrical content..."
4,Awesome if you like creed or bush,I got this cd after somebody brought it to my work and let me have a listen. I decided to get it. It reminds me a lot of both bush and creed somehow mixed with heavy christian lyrics.Watching You Die gets peoples attention and holds it. It is a very preachy CD so people not into christian rock could get grumpy if you make them listen.
4,Evocative and arresting debut... ****1/2 stars,"The debut album from Jonah33 is simply arresting at times. While a few of the lyrics fall into conventional Christian parameters, the group does find a fair amount of poetry to wrap driving guitars around. Bands that this recalls include Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and rightly so... I wouldn't lump this material with 4th or 5th generation grunge, but would place it closer to the source.""Faith Like That"" gripped me from the first listen. Beautifully orchestrated, it combines the elements of dynamic percussion, sweeping strings, driving guitar and visceral vocals and a heart-felt plea for something better.The other tracks are also worth the purchase, ranging from good to great.Honestly, the guitar work alone is worth the buy.-Matt, from The Tricycle Wipeout http://myspace.com/thetricyclewipeout"
5,Awesome!,This record is awesome. Faith like that is amazing. Must have record for anyone who likes a good record for Rock Music.
2,Not strong enough.,"In researching the genre, I was pointed to this book in several references. Although the wealth of full scripts is a plus, the scholarly portion relies too frequently on other sources (end notes galore) to be of any first-hand value. The authors cite Gordon's ""Grand Guignol"" with frequency...however, not frequent enough for me to shell out the ninety bucks it's going for these days!"
1,on broadway,"CAN I GIVE A ZERO RATING? THEY SENT THE WRONG ITEM AND WHEN I E-MAILED THEM, THE RESPONSE WAS THAT A MIX-UP HAD OCCURED AND THE ITEM I WANTED WAS SENT ELSEWHERE. SURELY THE ""ELSEWHERE"" WOULD HAVE NOTICED THEY DID NOT GET WHAT THEY ORDERED EITHER. THERE WAS NO OFFER TO FIND WHAT I WANTED, SIMPLY TO KEEP WHAT THEY SENT ME, WHICH WAS A NICE OFFER, BUT THIS WAS A CD I ALREADY OWNED."
1,On Broadway Roger Whittaker,I recieved the CD with the wrong disc in it. Instead of Rodger in the On Broadway jewel case I got Richard Burmer. I wrote the sellr but got no response. I Would not buy from Ultrabuys again. I got ripped off
5,A beautiful telling of an untold tale.,"The story of a very poorly Prince, who suffered what we would now call learning difficulties and epilepsy, he was much adored by his Mother, Queen Mary. Times dictated he was ""shut away"" to save face and keep prying eyes away. He lived most his short life in a purpose built house in royal grounds with a devoted Nanny. This film brings the story and it's contextual misery, vividly to life, the prince is played deliciously so as to display fragilty, vulnerability and misunderstanding in huge measure. Miranda Ricahrdson is fantastic as the pain racked Queen as is Gina Mackee is an intense and devoted Nanny.It is difficult with modern eyes to see why this life was accepted but he film gives a great sense of the different time and the different value systems, morals and social order. Fabulous costumes and wonderful photography too. An absolute must since it is a brilliant telling of a true but untold story."
1,The Lost Prince,The movie was boring and had no where to go after he kept having seizures. I thought that the acting was poor.
3,"[Three stars out of Four] Long, Dull, Boring, drawn-out look at the Brits royal family","Story centres on young Prince who neverquite grows up, who is kept locked up &away from contact with everyday people.Uppercrust brit production is in two partson DVD. Not for everybody's tastes but wellfilmed, acted and great scenery. Queen'svisit to hospital to see youngsters blownapart in WWI is not to be missed. A ringingindictment against war."
5,Poignant and compelling,"My oh my! The Lost Prince is a moving, compelling story of a forgotten prince. Son of a King of England, Prince John in all likelihood was on the autistic spectrum. His story, that of his parents and the historical context of his life made for a very interesting movie. How I cried when it was over! Highly recommend! To note, John would be the uncle of the current Queen of England, Elizabeth. What a family! Fact is definitely more interesting than fiction."
2,The Lost Prince,What is barely mentioned is the long tedium of the movie. Abbreviation would have done more for it. I loved the frocks and the interiors but the dialogue was a bit limited. I love costume dramas but this did not float my boat and after one viewing I am looking for a new home for the Lost Prince
5,The Lost Prince,"The acting, directing, costumes and background were all excellent. It appeared that the movie intended to be historically accurate as possible. The story may be to sad for some."
2,Boring,"This was boring.I love historical films, fiction, costume dramas, british films and TV... but this was acted poorly and just a snooze. Why did I keep watching?"
4,Where are the pictures??!!!!!,"The book is great, but I was very unhappy when I opened it and noticed there were no pictures. That may not be a problem for some cooks, but it's a problem for me. I'm just warning those who like to see picutres in a cookbook."
2,not so hot,Caribbean CookingThis book is ok but I'm not so hot about it. It doesn't have any pictures and some of the recipes are not too hot.
1,Don't waste your time if your a developer,"This is a surprisingly short book, given the subject matter. I was very disappointed at the lack of depth, especially since I own both Nadine Kano's book (found it on Amazon auctions!) and the CJK Information Processing tome by Ken Lund.With the increased development of Java and Thin-Client web apps, developers are sorely in need of a book that details Industry standard methods of development in this area. This book is useless from this perspective. My advice: check out .... ; I found it far more useful as a resource."
2,Bad Sound Quality (love the songs),"I love these songs and many others from the doo wop era. However, the mastering of these songs on this specific collection leaves much to be desired. I have several tracks from other more recent collections that are also included on this CD. The more recent releases are clearer and louder and overall just represent a better sound. The sound quality of this CD is sub-par."
4,Classic Dion was never better,"Most of his well known hits are here. Great sounds, a perfect addition to your oldies collection. Inexpensive and very much worth it."
5,Took Me Back in Time.,All the songs of my youth are on this CD. Great to hear their voices again. I am sharing with my grandchildren.
4,Was a little too small for my needs.,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it was a bit too small for my needs. It will prob be fine for small camera lenses as designed. I was looking for an antistatic brush to use to dust off internal PC parts like Graphics & Sound card circuit boards,& Motherboard. Dust always accumulates inside PC cases & they need to be cleaned out once in a while.I've been building my own PC's for 12 years. A friend called me not too long ago with a constant shutdown problem. It seems the PC was overheating & was shutting down before any damage could occur. The case was loaded with dust so bad,he had to get the vacuum cleaner & a small brush."
3,Too partial. . .,"The authors of this book are so pro-MST that the last page in the book includes information about where you can send money if you wish to contribute to the movement. It may be true that some land reform is necessary in Brasil, but not in the way the many of the people involved in the MST go about it. Yes, some of the landholders who own large farms and ranches resort to violence to protect their property, but the squatters also aren't afraid of killing people to get what they want. There has got to be a better book out there that tells both sides of the story. This one is too biased."
1,Don't clean these windows!,The typography of this songbook is horrible. In many places you can't tell what the chord change is because of the bad typesetting. I was really disappointed with this selection. I was going to send it back but I kept it just for the limited number of songs that I can read and sing. Try another song book but don't buy this one...save your money.
4,Tommy Vance On Ice!!!,"What a marvellous contribution to my windsock this pamphlet has made. The tale of Biffo the Twig and some musty crab sticks. Everyone's favorite gumshoe, Biffo, has a case to solve. Madame Gergerger has been murdered and there is no motive or clues except for a note from Horace Mcmcmc saying I did it!! This is a real page turner, mainly due to the robotic hand supplied by the publishers."
2,Not so great,"When I first received this scale I loved it, it is small approximately 7""X4"" with a 5X5 glass tray. I used it daily and for the first month it was great, very accurate and easy to use. The feature that allows you to put a plate on the scale and then zero the weight was great and it was very easy to use. Unfortunatly after only 3 months of use the scale started acting crazy, it would turn off and on intermittantly and the weight would change while the food was on, at first this was occasional but it happened more and more frequently and by the time I had the scale for 4 months it didn't work at all. I would expect somehting like this to last more than 4 months even with daily use. I will definatly be trying a different brand for my next scale."
1,poor performance,This scale resets every time you add or remove an item from it. Very frustrating. It is so small it is very hard to read the display.
3,Taylor 8# digital kitchen scale... didn't even last for one year,"I bought this item at a local supermarket on Dec. 7, 2009. I stored it in the box, as it only had infrequent use. A few months ago, it would not power on, so I changed the (long-life, as claimed by the manufacturer) battery (and they're not cheap). That seemed to do the trick. However, the unit seemed a bit ""touchy,"" as it would sometimes tare during use, although I hadn't pressed the button.The scale had not been used since about October. When I attempted to use it in mid-November, it would not turn on. I even bent the battery contact prongs up slightly, just in case that was the problem. That didn't help.To get warranty service, I'll have to send it to Las Cruces, NM. I'm debating whether to spend another ~$11 on postage, when I could possibly receive another piece of junk. I gave it a 3-star rating because when it did work, it was OK."
1,What a piece of junk,"I received my scale a few weeks ago but only went to start using it now because I am starting my weight loss program. Put in a brand new battery (thinking that maybe that is what it needed) and it will not work. I turn it on, it shows the 8888 and then immediately goes to Err. Cannot figure out what would be wrong with it and since it has a battery that obviously works because the numbers show in the window, all I can figure is that I got a dud. The box is gone and all I have is the directions anymore. Very unhappy with my purchase. Now I have to buy a new one and it definitely won't be a Taylor."
4,Use for a long time,I have bought it for 3 months. The string is also in very good condition. The shipment is quickly. I should buy more in the future.
3,Pleasantly Pleased,"Although this was a relatively low budget production, the young actor who played the autistic boy did a fantastic job. I look forward to seeing him in future movies as his career progresses."
2,A little too long...,"The premise is decent, but the execution is not very well thought out, particularly concerning the supernatural elements. Overall, the film feels too long, with many scenes ending up very wordy with characters just standing around talking endlessly and unrealistically to each other. There are a few good performances, including those from Jeff Boyet and Josh Childs, but a few good characters can't save a whole film."
5,Great Comfortable shoe!!,I wear these shoes most days all day and they are a very comfortable shoe! Give great arch support and run true to size. This is my second pair and I would highly recommend them. Searched several places and Amazon had the best price by far.
4,nice shoes,"I love kswiss shoes there made very good and are very comfortable shoes, they came when they are supposed too"
3,"the shoe sole quality, not up to expectations...very good looks thou","bought it from amazon, last week. the shoe sole is made up of rubber, old fashoioned, thought it would be synthetic, like adidas & rbk. however, got good looks when worn, and quite comfortable."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,"This was a video I had when I was little, and to this day, I can still remember a LOT of the lyrics to these silly songs. I could never pull my eyes away from this video when it was on, and still would LOVE to watch it with my 2 year old daughter. The recurring theme in this video is working together to help our friends, which is an added bonus to this very creatively made video! Would definitely recommend to ANY parent!"
4,Clips are useful,"Although the Rick Steves clothesline looks more substantial, I prefer this one because it has clips at the ends instead of loops. I never use the suction cups. There are times when it is difficult to put a loop around a knob, but I can always wrap this line around the shower curtain rod or something else, and then clip it."
4,Highly recommended for traveling light,"This clothesline was great for doing small amounts of laundry while traveling. It can be very long and hold a lot of clothes. It was very sturdy and held up to a lot of tension so that the line wouldn't sag.The suction cups were not necssary, we used the clips to either clip the line to something or wrap the end around something and clip it to itself to form a little loop.The only small thing that could be offered is another shorter version. A lot of hotel rooms in Europe are not very big so finding things far enough apart to attach the line to can be challenging."
3,"Bargain Prices, Bargain Product",Suction cups won't hold a wet sock! They're cute but non-functional. Luckily this product is cheap enough that it doesn't really matter. If you're looking for a better product check out the Rick Steve's clotheline or the Flexoline. Both rely on the same design which is a step up from this product.
3,Suction cups don't work,It's ok for the price and works fine as long as you use the velcro. The suction cups don't stick to anything.
2,my line on clothesline,"The suction-cups were warped from packaging and didn't hold well. We did use the line, though, securing it with the excellent Velcro straps at each end. We were grateful for clean, dry underwear in Salzburg."
5,FEET BE STILL!,"WOW!We had the great pleasure of listening to ""the Prince"" at the 2000 Houston International Festival. His infectious rhythm and rich powerful voice had us all mesmerized. The title song""Les Problems"" is basically about we all have problems and worries, let's make the best of it.I higly recommend this CD and all music by the Prince."
3,"The ""forewunner"", as Elmer Fudd would say","Eight years before publishing their masterpiece ""Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies..."", Friedwald and Beck teamed up for ""The Warner Bros. Cartoons"". This book lacks illustrations and the text is less informative than in the later work, but it does have concise reviews or plot synopses of every Warner's cartoon released between 1930 and 1969. It's interesting to note the changes of opinion on some of the cartoons...for example, ""The Apes Of Wrath"" is unfavorably reviewed in 'TWBC' (probably by Beck) and more highly regarded (by Friedwald) in 'LT&MM'. Both books should be on the reading list of every Warner Brothers cartoon fan."
2,Waste of Money,"This was an absolute waste of money, the number 2 ingredient? Flour. You can make this at home (if you like bland curry). Basically this is turmeric, flour and very little else. And I bought the hot versions which wasn't hot at all. Try Chiefs curry powder instead! I hate to write bad reviews but after reading the positive ones here I bought it and felt robbed."
3,Jamaican Curry,"All my years eating curry, I've never heard about the Blue Mountain brand. I thought BM concentrated only on coffee. I bought this curry for my dad who lives in the US simply because it's the only brand Amazon carries. Next time I'll order the BM Hot Curry which should be much spicier."
5,Great Curry Seasoning,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. Excellent shipping and fast delivery. Very delicious curry powder.
3,It is what I expected,"I was not expecting a brillant work of literary genius here. I was expecting what I received...which was an inarticulate but heartfelt version of what happened behind the scenes of a very public trial that captivated America. As for everyone's opinions of Amber, well to each their own, and so goes for her. Yes, she made very stupid naive mistakes, many times over. And I am not sure she had a good grasp on many realities, but she did the right thing by speaking out at the trial. She deserves her voice to be heard....so if this is her fifteen minutes, let her have them. Buy the book if you if you followed the case and for no other reason, you wont be disappointed if you know what you are getting."
3,Interesting,"Amber's book is good, not dynamic, but good. If you are an avid follower of the Peterson trial, you'll be interested regarding her perspective. She did the right thing in assisting the investigation and for this, she deserves our respect."
2,More editor than Amber,"Life is complicated and I have sympathy for Amber and the situation she was in but this book is a loosely thrown together patchwork of her real voice in transcripts, and her editors voice using a style and phrasing and language inconsistent with Amber's voice.It tries too hard to justify her which she seems to sorely need."
1,lame,"Amber Frey is a money hungry, sad little person. It's really too bad that she felt the need to cash in on the tragedy of others. Luckily I was able to borrow this book so I didn't contribute to feeding her greed."
1,Self serving,"Amber Frey had sex with Scott Peterson the very night she met him.Before her child had even been introduced to Peterson she had him accompany her to pick the kid up from school.The only thing that really ended her romantic invovlement with him was finding another man.All these facts are all too unpleasantly on display in this self serving and obfuscatory work by Amber Frey.Though I'd picked up this book hoping to gain some insight into the mind of Scott Peterson from someone who had unique access to him in the days leading up to and away from his wife's disappearance, I was severely disappointed. That's because Frey was more interested in making excuses for what should have been obvious lapses in judgment.Unintentionally Frey revealed the intellectual abilities and life style habits of the type of woman Peterson would be interested in. But aside from that readers were left just as much in the dark about who Scott Peterson really was as they were when they originally picked up this book."
1,Remember Laci Not Amber,"There couldn't be two women more different than Laci and Amber.I think of Laci's sincere love for others and devotion to herfamily,then I look at Amber's inability to put two words together without the help of a ghostwriter and it makes me ill.Amber tries to make herself a hero but it all falls short.Her mention of her high moral standards are constantly mentionedmuch to my horror.I can't believe how she plays the victim yetshe repeats the same mistakes over and over again.Her usage ofmen is astounding,but she's always the victim in any controversial situation she finds herself in.Remember the realvictim Laci and you'll soon forget about Amber."
1,Skip it,"If you want to enable someone to profit off a tragedy, then buy this book. The book contains nothing that will not be heard on various talk shows Amber is making the rounds on, so save your money or if you must read it get it at the library. [...]"
2,Amber On Amber ...,"I followed the Scott Peterson case on and off while it was going on. I could have an intelligent conversation about the case, but could not give you the little details that many could. This book didn't give me the details.Witness came across as a book that was less about the case and more about how great Amber Frey was for coming forward and impacting the case the way she did. That's a fine concept for a book, but not when the person who is getting praised is also the person writing the book.I'd be lying if I said that this book didn't give details about the case, it did, and if you're someone who just wants the bare bones of what the case was about then this is the book for you ... but the majority of the book focused on Amber Frey talking about how great a person Amber Frey is. The book was a good enough read, but it could have been so much more."
1,Genuine Trash,"Terrible writing, blatantly opportunistic and not worth anyone's time or money. I read 15 pages, my disgust level rising with every word, and finally threw the book away. It's barely readable - clearly the work of an individual motivated by profit. Initially, I thought her brave to step forward and speak up; however, this piece of junk changed my mind. Don't waste your time."
1,don't even bother,"why would anyone even want to spend a single penny on a book like this? we have all heard the story and we don't need to hear it again from some barbie doll. i just looked at the cover and i knew she was just trying to get more air time. hey amber, WE GET THE PICTURE!"
1,"""Witness For A PERSECUTION""","Amber Frey and her attorney, Glroia Allred, have hit an all time low with this piece of literary trash!Amber Frey's tell nothing book offers the reader an inside view of her self-serving, 'I'm a victim and hero' rhetoric that the public could surely do without.Save your money and time! This book is the equivalent of a 2nd graders Highlights weekly required reading."
1,judgment,"One Amazon reviewer cautions: ""Judge not lest ye be judged."" Fine. I am willing to be judged on the morals and the values underlying the decisions portrayed in his book. This woman is an opportunistic, vain, self-serving, self-involved, boringly promiscuous, lying lover. My astonishment is that people who are readers read this! People pay a significant amount of money to read this trash. Meanwhile literature...fiction as well as non-fiction...suffers from publishing houses' overweening attention to supporting this prurient junk. Go figure. And Amazon sends me a special email encouraging me to buy it. Why would anyone spend good money to read this crap? I champion a million hardworking prostitutes before I support a woman who postures righteousness while she parades a series of dishonorable men through her children's home, and then, when it profits her, betrays them. So he's a jerk. So is she."
3,Gee! Is there a way for me to make money from this???,"Amber might have been totally innocent in this whole case, but she sure found a way to make money out of the situation. The only reason I bought this, is because I needed a book to read on my flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne. She tells her story well, but you should only borrow this from a friend or the library instead of contributing to the ""Pity Me Amber"" fund. This is a bit of a sob story for sure."
1,Isn't America Great!!,"Everyone who buys this book has been ripped off! Demand a refund!Interesting little story, this Petterson case. But how much can Amber really add to the story, especially the part that hasn't already been told a billion times over? We need a book by Scott detailing all the incredible complexities and psychoanalytical issues with his sick, twisted brain. A real medical study and much meat that would produce! Amber is a side-kick who in the end is laughing to the bank! Don't fall for her fake crying, thinking this book carries any dramatic value!! She learned the acting method via Scott! I've read thousands (literally!) of books and this is the worse! Ever![...]"
2,My Two Cents' Worth,"I have never read any other Laci/Scott books, and happened upon this one at the library, I read it in a few hours. I found it absurd that Ms. Frey kept on re-emphasizing her religious faith, her old-fashioned values, and her desire to start a traditional family, when at the same time she slept with Scott on their first date together, and then fathered a second child out of wedlock (the same way she fathered her first).The fact that she doesn't seem to see her actions as inconsistent with her professed beliefs makes me doubt she has a good handle on reality, and I had a hard time believing anything else she recounted in her book."
4,And the Verdict is........,"AWESOME! This book was very captivating. I found it very interesting because I am a Criminal Justice student and I have followed this story very closely. It was interesting because Amber's side of the story filled in a lot of holes. I read it in one day- I wish it were longer, but it is definitely interesting. All I can say is that Scott Peterson is a crazy pathological liar!"
1,SORRY EXCUSE FOR A WITNESS,"I didn't buy this book, my daughter did. I'm so glad that I didn't dish out any money for this stupid book. Amber is nothing but a hypocrite. She is judgemental of so many and yet, she doesn't see herself in all her descriptions of Scott Peterson. The only difference between them is that she didn't actually do away with Laci. She doesn't know if ""she's made her mark in this world?"" Please, give everybody a break. You don't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Laci Rocha Peterson. Keep any other info (if you have any left) to yourself, Amber Frey. The rating system above doesn't have 0 stars, as that is what this book deserves."
3,If You Are Curious - Nothing Special,"If you could not stop watching Court TV and CNN then you will enjoy this book. Otherwise, just read a few pages in the bookstore and move on with your life. This story has been told and retold. There is no need to beat a dead horse."
1,YOU ARE NOT LACI'S VOICE!!!!!!!!!,"I am completely disgusted that she has the nerve to even think that! Sharon Rocha is Laci's voice. This book is just another in the long line of books in the Peterson cash cow extravaganza. ""For Laci"" is a much better choice if you want to read about the Peterson case."
1,ZERO stars . . .,"As I said to my husband as I closed the book's back cover; ""worst book I've ever read""! But if you must, read it at the bookstore, it's one way to waste an afternoon."
3,Inarticulate,"Witness provides many answers, inadvertently at Amber's expense. For example, Amber's letter to Scott, along with her testimony to police -- both printed verbatim -- paint a picture of a person who speaks and writes incoherently.Amber's concern for Laci and Connor, in my opinion, was disingenuous. Perhaps if Amber had a history of helping strangers, i.e. volunteering to find missing children or helping battered women, we could be convinced of her empathy and compassion. Instead, we're presented with details of how naive and (sexually) impulsive she was.I do believe that in the spiritual sense, Amber did serve as the voice for Laci, playing a pivotal role in the prosecution of Scott. I just wish we could give Amber more credit for this.All in all, the book is a quick, easy read. Do I believe Amber did most of the writing? No!"
3,Pretty good quick read.,Amber lets us in on her side of the story. She is remarkably believable. I did not watch the trial and tried to avoid news reports of it. This was a quick one day read.
4,Read this book if you wondered like I did...,"I closely followed the investigation and subsequent trial and always had a strong feeling that Amber Frey was a good person who was a victim of Scott Peterson's evident sociopathic nature. I encourage you to read the book if you were at all curious. Amber's chronicle of the short time she knew Scott and of her life make for a very interesting read. If you had any doubt about his guilt before, read this. You'll see.Great book...Amber's a good story teller. I read the entire book in one day- The Blizzard of 2005"
3,Won't become exactly a literary classic but....,"...this book really helps put this famous through the eyes of someone else other than CNN reporters. Amber Frey's prose may not be that of a literary genius, it's a good fast read. If anyone thought the same way I did, then they would have thought that Amber Frey was some horrible woman trying to break up the Petersons' marriage, but that wasn't the case at all. For those who are absolutely fascinated by famous court cases such as this, than this book is for you. If you are absolutely sick to death of hearing about the Peterson trial, don't pick this book up.One last thing, it's good but not so great to pay the hardcover price. Wait for paperback."
1,I paid money for this?,"I admit - I wasted my money. If you've seen any of her interviews you already know the whole story. Not only is this book boring, I got tired of Amber going on and on about her faith, but where are her morals when it comes to all the men?? I praise her for coming forward on her own, but the police would've found her anyway when they went through Scott's cell phone records!"
1,such a disappointment..save your money,"I have to admit I preordered this book as I had followed the trial from beginning to end and was hoping to find some new and or interesting information. Well, I was sadly disappointed. This is nothing more than a very long magazine article with no new information, not very well written and a story about a person who is so naive it is unbelievable. After seeing her interviews on many tv shows I can see how easily she could have been duped.It is a sad story but do not waste your money on this book. Everything you need to or want to know has been said in her tv interviews....I am thankful that she had the courage to come forward and testify but I feel sorry for Laci's family that this woman is making money from her part in this sad story."
1,Can anyone really be this stupid?,"I picked up this book in the airport looking for somthing quick to read while traveling. I was struck by the stupidity of Amber Frey. Most anyone would have noticed the red flags waving over head or perhaps the sound of the robot yelling in the back groud.... ""Danger Will Robinson, Danger"".In the words of John Wayne... ""Life is hard.... but it is harder when you are stupid""Based on this book - Amber has a really hard life in front of her."
1,Talk about a tornado in a trailer park...........,"Between the ""Glamour Shots & Easy Sex, Different Babys' Daddys"" What else is there? Oh yeah, the many scripture quotes & abortion info. Dont forget unprotected sex with every man she dates. Dont forget letting a strange man pick your daughter up from school. Poor Amber!This gave me insight alright, on how dysfunctional Amber Frey is.Shame on her for using Laci's photo!I hope that she spends her profits on much needed therapy & a Tubal Ligation!"
1,Lord Have Mercy!,"I should have trusted my intuition to put this book back on the shelf and let someone else have it when I skimmed through it and saw all the pictures of Amber. I was interested in getting more indepth NEW information regarding the case and there was none to found in this book. An appropriate title would have been ""Amber Frey's Awful Modeling photos""."
1,"Turning Tragedy Into A Personal ""Cash Cow""","This woman's insight into Scott Peterson & the murders of Laci & Connor Peterson is neither important nor relevant. Her relationship with Scott Peterson has already been beaten to death by the media. There's nothing left that anyone with any sense would care to know. Not that there was anything interesting about her, or the two of them as a ""couple"", in the first place. This woman is turning a tragedy into personal gain. She now claims that ""some of the proceeds from this book will go to charities"". That's because she knew backlash from this swill would be inevitable."
2,How dumb is this woman?!,"There isn't much more in this book to shed light on the Peterson case than there was in a recent issue of People Magazine. Amber Frey clearly has extremely poor judgment, horrible parenting skills (she describes herself as ""fiercely protective"" and then has some guy she's known for what, a week, pick up her daughter from school and take her home, alone), and portrays herself as a martyr throughout the entire book, which gets old really fast. She pats herself on the back way too many times in this book for doing what any normal person would do. The book was annoying."
1,guilty,"Amber Frey is guilty...she is guilty of being stupid for going to a blind dates hotel room RIGHT OFF THE BATShe is guilty for getting drunk and spending the night being intimate with himshe is guilty of child endangerment for having this stranger pick up and be alone with her 2 year old daughter on the 2nd dateshe is guilty of having ""unprotected""sex with anyone let alone a strangershe is guilty of not telling us what she had been so ""hurt"" about which made her so vulnerable thereby excusing her behaviorshe is guilty of incredible stupidity for asking if scott had ""rigor mortis""in his hand""according to catherine criers bookshe is guilty of being a religious hypocrite...another child born out of wedlockand just who said she didn't know about Laci's murder ahead of time?just wondering"
1,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE BOOK - Save Your Money,I hope this author keeps her day job since her authoring skills are way below standard. I was hoping for further insight into this horrendous crime but NONE was to be found in this book.I was also horrified to find that I actually paid money to see more of those pitiful modeling pictures of Amber that I already saw on the internet for free!This book is a self serving hodgepodge of nothing. So disappointing. Don't believe the hype on this one. None of it is true.
1,garbage writes garbage,"now I'm not stupid enough to buy this trash but I did read most of it at the local book store. My title, ""Dumb Blonde has book written for her"". Shame on anyone who buys this crap. There are starving great writers out there that deserve your support. So go watch some court TV and get over it!(...)"
3,Mary Fonseca -The Dame,"Although it was fascinating to hear the story directly from ""The Woman"" who accidentally became the probably reason for a murder, it did, of course, only give her insight as to why it all happened. It is an interesting book for that reason, but, of course, it does not give the details founds in some of the other books published on the Scott Peterson case. Still, I couldn't put it down and I was absorbed with those lurid ""details."""
4,she deserves a four. . . here's why:,"I realize that some reviewers are angry Amber Frey might make some money from this book. I disagree. I think, if you're interested in the Scott Peterson case and want to read more information about it, this book will fit the bill. She has a story to tell and she went through quite a bit of emotional anguish. This book clearly isn't about making money, although, really, I don't see the harm in that. It's clearly about telling her story and clearing up misconceptions that may have been formed about her.Amber's tale IS interesting. She is an honest woman who found herself involved with a dishonest unscrupulous sociopathic man. There is information here that the media couldn't tell us and some more insight into Scott's terrifying amoral behavior.As an added plus, Amber's life can actually be considered inspirational. She honestly admits the poor choices she's made in the past and discusses how she overcame all of the obstacles she's faced."
2,Why?,"I read Witness and when I was finished I wondered why (besides the money factor) anybody would want to exploit themselves in the manner that Amber Frye did. It sounds like she thrives on DRAMA. I use to feel sorry for her, but after reading the book I'm not so sure. The book is good only for entertainment purposes and her side of the story. You don't have to read the book to realize that Scott Peterson is guilty as sin!"
1,Waste of paper,"This is a great read for empty minded nitwits. It is a fast read that does not require thinking, debate, or contemplation. Life is short enough to waste even an hour of it on this badly written trash. Save your money and go out and buy a few comic books - they too have pictures and offer a 3rd grade reading level."
2,Heard It All In The Court Room,Everything I read in this book was covered in the court room! If you followed the case you will not learn anything new in this book except Amber Freys poor choices in relationships and how she might be dealing with her own mental illness that she is notaware of. This book was a waste of time and she just repeated her same story for monetary value. But I do give her credit for standing up for herself and helping the police with these cold hearted murders Scott commited.
4,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this book. Mostly, I liked it. I read it in a day, since it is an easy read.I felt sympathetic towards Amber, but not totally. By the time kid #2 without a husband came along, I thought ""Does this woman know about birth control?"" And then she's shocked both times, when the man who hasn't committed himself before the pregnancy isn't thrilled about it?And I certainly wouldn't go to a guy's hotel room so he could shower BEFORE his date. Don't most people manage their time enough to show up for your date AFTER you shower??OK, so she's not pefect. I don't think she was a money grubber to write a book. She had a lot of opportunities to sell out before the trial ended.I do have to say that it was an interesting read. True, not much new in it, but I really did see even more clearly what a total LIAR Scott Peterson is. It's almost comical."
2,Weird,"I think it was important for Amber Frey to get her story out, and I think she is a victim in all of this, but this is a shoddy attempt to profit off of the whole situation."
1,Nothing New,"This book is of two parts. The vast majority of it is made up of court, phone and police transcripts. All of which is available on courttv. The rest of the book goes into details of the relationship she had with Peterson.. Aside from the emotional aspects, all of this is also detailed within court papers.Since Ms Frey has no direct knowledge or experience of the actual murder and no contact with Laci Peterson, then what we have left is a scorned woman who was lied too. Yes, she did help the police. There are pictures of her as an 18 year old model and of her child.There is so much more that I can write about this book, but every comment I can think of touches on Ms Frey's character and therefore will be removed my Amazon.com like most of the other previous review of this book. My recommendation is not to purchase the book. There is nothing new in this book regarding the case and there are far better books out there that detail emotional challenges."
2,Mediocre at best C-,"As an admitted Peterson case ""junkie"", I've purchased every book relating to the case. This book was a waste of my money. I feel the author exploited the situation, and offered absolutely no new insight in the book. It was not the worst book I've ever read, but I opted against keeping it in my permanent collection, and donated it to Goodwill. Don't waste your money folks, wait until you can buy it used at a cheap price. C-"
2,NOT MUCH NEW INFORMATION,"I hate the fact that Amber is making money off Laci Peterson's murder, but I had to buy this book. It is a quick read, with a lot of phone transcripts, quotes from news show interviews and pictures already seen. For the most part, I didn't learn much more than I already learned just by watching Court TV and Fox News. I do admire Amber for doing what she did to help the prosecution, it had to be extremely stressful, but I think this was a way to cash in and make money off the case. Sadly, most people would probably do the same thing in her shoes."
1,Pathetic,"As I read through this book, sure it kept me going, but it turns out that Amber Frey is really a joke. She seems to have enjoyed her ""fame"" during the Rocha's time of crisis. It seems as if she has taken this situation into a money grabber. I have learned that she is devoted to herself, and she seems very promiscuous and flirtatious with many men she has encountered.The writing in this book has many repetitive words as the chapter unfold, and yes, it seems as if she did not write from her heart, but she rushed through it as quickly as possible. In addition, there are numerous pages filled with her photos, modeling ones too!Not a very good book; if interested in reading about the Laci case, I prefer you purchase the book written by Scott's sister."
2,Questions left unanswered,"I felt like Amber portrayed herself constantly in the light that she knows her daughter will someday review. Throughout the book she constantly professed her belief in the lord, but her daily life did not justify it. After reading the book, I feel she was very pretentious, what she did was to protect herself from Peterson, who she thought would harm her. I am still left with alot of questions. Ruth Hubertz"
1,Who bloody cares?,Since when did we become so shallow and vapid that we have to confess our sins to an anonymous world? Why should we care about this case? Why does Amber Frey feel the need to tell the entire world about it? Have we become so vapid that our own lives do not keep us busy enough that we need to pry into the lives of complete strangers?Our culture is bankrupt. The fact that this book is actually selling is a tell-tale sign.
1,A Sad Case about a Sad Case,I am so sorry I bought this book-it appears to me to have been written with one intention in mind and that was to make money.The book is poorly written-Amber is constantly seeking the readers sympathy-and quotes the bible on far too many occassions-yet her unchristian like behavior is repeated throughout the bookI hope Amber find happiness-but i also hopes she goes away from the public eye!
3,Amber Frey,"The book doesn't really shed any new light on the Peterson case. I found the book to be lacking in emotion and truthfullness. In one chapter she refers to her unstable childhood as ""pleasant"". Ms. Frey also glosses over her lost friendships and personal relationships with men. In effect, the book was dull. I kept waiting for the part where she would just get ""real"" and it never happened. Still, the similarities between her and Jackie Peterson are frightening. It seems as both women used children as an entrance into marriage. Thankfully for Amber that never happened, or she too may have become a victim of Scott Peterson."
2,guilty of stupidity,"I read this book several years ago. I didn't review it at the time,but a recent headline about Scott Peterson on death row nudged me. The book itself was just okay. It held my interest for the most part and I got thru it without too much skipping ahead. The writer herself was very annoying and that did color my perception of the book. She went to bed with this guy on the first date, knowing virtually nothing about him, a friend of a friend. She trusted him alone with her small daughter after going out with him a couple of times. She comes across as being this person who is all spiritual and good and noble, just a poor, helpless victim.... I personally think she was looking for her 15 minutes of fame. Well she found it. I'd skip it. There are much better books about this crime."
1,She sure did it now,"News of the day is the girl didnt even know who the father of her daughter was , made him pay child support for 4 years never letting him visitation and now shes going to be a motivational speaker????? Comes around goes around. She did good job at proving herself a wh*** well I wont say it out loud. Tis sweet to live in a glass house :) Your book and you are both in the can .................TRASH CAN THAT IS"
1,0 Stars for this cheap $ grubbing massage therapist!,well this book is an insult. she claims to be christian and boy thats sad.she only wrote a book to secure a future for her illegimate kids ( shes said that herself). she goes after men with money and then gets pregnant.. I cant understand her at all. she should be ashamed. what will she say when her 2 kids ask where there fathers are? she has shown how cheap she really is.half naked pics maybe next time her phone rings it will be a porn magazine asking if she'll pose!
1,You will need a STIFF DRINK to get through this one!,"I thought I would get some insight into why Scott did this or even why Amber was so naive to trust this man after meeting him twice with her young daughter. She simply tries to confuse her audience about the kind of person/mother she is by citing the bible and referring to her faith in God. She talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk. I saw nothing new in this book and what's there is obviously hastily thrown together (I understand she wrote it, had it published, printed and shipped in 30 days). AND IT SHOWS. No go Amber!"
1,Hated this book,"I was an avid watcher of the trial and the events leading up to it. I knew before reading this book that there might not be alot of new information. I am a real Amber fan for coming forward. However, she seems to have filled the book with incredibly boring details just to fill pages (""We got into Scott's truck"" and then ""We got out of Scott's truck""). We learn that she is a serial non-user of birth control. I'm not making a moral statement-just saying that there are things in this book that aren't relavent to the account of her relationship with Scott and subsequent events. In addition, the book is an extremely DULL read. Finally, I find it very offensive that she uses the pictures of Laci, Sharon and Ron on the jacket of this book. Sharon Rocha asked Amber to remove Laci's picture and she refused! I am ashamed that I contributed to lining Amber's pockets."
1,Thank Goodness Paper Is Recycable,"Amber Frey falsely depicts herself as both a victim and heroine because she is neither! The only thing Amber Frey is the ""victim"" of is her own stated short-comings, bad judgment and self pity. Her alleged 'heroism' is merely a facade to make up for her blatant exploitation of two deaths.This book is filed with glaring inconsistencies to Amber's trial testimony, over-lapping and inaccurate dates, as well as a bunch of barely cogent and uninformative banter.[...]"
1,Don't Bother.,"I watched the trial unfold off and on, and was HOPING once this book came out that I would get some additional information.After all, the title "" Witness, for the Prosecution of Scott Peterson"" would mean something.Don't hold your breath, OR stay up late reading it, there is nothing new.It is weird though, watching the author jump from quoting the Bible, to jumping into bed with her blind date, to her publishing her photos of herself, ( why? ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...who knows, they have NOTHING to do with her being a witness)She turns it into a very poorly written bio of herself, a lot of self whining and wondering why the men in her life always seem to turn on her.I'd save my money, and wait until it's in the bargain bin ( if you REALLY want to slog through it) if not, don't lose any sleep, it's not worth it anyway."
1,Just horrible,"Amber Frye's book shows just how desperate and needy she is. She met Scott Peterson for dinner and ended up spending the night with him. For their next date, Scott takes Amber and her daughter on a hike. The following day, Amber allows Scott to pick up her daughter from preschool.Then Amber is shocked to find out that the ""love of her life and the man that she is going to spend the rest of her life with"" is really an adulterous murderer. What a shock.All in all, this book was a huge disappointment. Amber paints herself as a ""good judge of character"" but the opposite is true.I do not recommend this book. Please don't waste your money."
1,Very Poorly Written,One of the worst books I have read. The book was nothing more than the phone conversations between Scott and Amber. No imagination nor talent was evident in writing this book.
4,Very warm and comfortable,"I really enjoy these shoes. I use them for casual wear. They are very comfortable, true to size and I'm glad I purchased them. The fur appears to be getting that matted look after my initial break in but I think it will give the shoe character. I gave it 4 stars because of the fur issue. I'd buy them again. They are extremely comfortable."
5,WoW!,"I've had these slipper/shoes for 2 years and love them! I wore the first footbed out and replaced them because they are so comfy and warm. I have since ordered another pair in a differenct color and they are my ""dress"" ones and not for messy weather! Yes the shearling packs down, it does on the sheep too, I remove the footbed occasionally and fluff it up."
1,Pretentious,"Pretty architecture but wait till they start talking.Here is how this film goes: Blah. blah, blah... big word, big word. Blah. blah, blah... convoluted thought. Blah. blah, blah... we live in Europe. Blah. blah, blah... we are so over blown. Blah, blah, blah..."
1,Choppy and hard to understand,We got this because I knew and liked the story. It is hard to understand the accents. Keep looking.
1,Disappointed - OVERPRICED.,"The piture makes this item appear much larger than it actually is in person, and it was ""vacuum"" wrapped, so the presentation is nothing like it is in the picture. After inspecting the four items in the basket and doing some research, I'd estimate the value of this basket to be more like $30...not $70 (plus an additional $10 sipping cost!) This item is worth about half the cost. On a positive note, I received the item the very next day from the shipper with standard shipping, howver the box they shipped it in was not taped well at all and itlooked like the delivery driver sat on it the entire way here."
5,Top Ten Plays,"I saw this show years ago on Broadway. I was standing in the TIX line with my husband, and the woman behind us recommended it. Mimimal set, especially for a Broadway production, and almost all of the actors were playing double roles. The show is everything that is good about theatre. Maximum impact because the magic happens in the minds of the audience. I'm amazed that it isn't produced more frequently. The theme is theatre as a civilizing influence. I couldn't agree more."
3,An interesting play,"I have acted in this play at my college and i thoroughly enjoyed it i found that it had a good variety of characters which added to the interesting storyline. Set in convict Australia, its not only a good read its historical as well."
2,don't bother,"There is nothing how-to about this book in the least. It is really a history of humor:""Thackeray tell us that humor is 'wit an love,' and Anne Evans declares that is 'thinking in fun while we feel in earnest.'""Surely Dryden did not suppose that the almighty mob would be corrected by his verses, but perhaps he expected to convert a few individuals from too great a trust in the wisdom of majorities. It is certain that a clever satire is often more effective than a logical argument.""""The word 'sarcasm' has a suggestive etymology. In ancient Greek, 'sarkos' meant flesh, and 'sarkadzein' came to mean tear flesh, like dogs, or to speak so bitterly as to suggest the tearing of flesh.""I didn't cherry-pick these quotes - the whole book is like that. It's interesting, just not what I thought I was buying."
5,A lyrical book about the creatures around us.,"This book reveals the uniqueness of each species it spotlights. A beautifully written book that is packed with little known facts about these wondrous creatures. If you enjoy this book, check out Ms. Ackerman's other titles: ""A Natural History of Love"", ""A Natural History of the Senses"" where she continues to deliver thought provoking information with sensually written text."
3,Light Nature Essays,"This collection of essays is certainly beautifully written. The topics of bats, crocodiles, whales and penguins were all fascinating and fairly informative. The book just didn't really wow me - much of the information was not new and though the author put herself into the essays, there wasn't really enough of that to put a more interesting angle on the collection as a whole."
3,Nature writer vs. naturalist who writes,"Basically, as stories about animals we don't have much contactwith, this is a pretty good book. As science, well... Two sentences that floored me read, ""How could anything that heavy float? But doesn't the moon float?"" Uh, Ms. Ackerman, the moon is outside the earth's gravitational pull and ships float. What exactly was your point?"
4,A keen observer with a poetic eye,"Diane Ackerman's sharp observations, poetic descriptions, reflective commentary, and search for knowledge make this an enjoyable reading experience. My favorite piece was the one on bats, with their amazing echolocating screams, biological helpfulness for making many plants survive, and intriguing wing designs. Ackerman does a good job of dispelling many horror stories about bats, showing how they have gotten a bad rap over the years. Her article on crocodiles was also enthusiastic and winsome. I thought the whale essay was a little slow and monotonous in parts, otherwise I would give this book a five star rating. Definitely a good book to read by the fire or relax with at the beach."
4,The moon by whale light,"Diane Ackerman published poetry and nature reporting for a variety of publications before she began publishing books. This particular book is a compilation of essays that were originally published in shorter versions in The New Yorker. The essays are on bats, crocodilians (mostly alligators), whales, and penguins, and they generally include factual information about the animal in question as well as Ackerman's musings on them. Ackerman's background in poetry is clear - some of her asides on the animals and the scenery seem like the beginnings of poems. This would be a good book for a youngster who's interested in biology - there is some frank talk about animal sex and death, so I would recommend it for ages 10-16 or so."
5,"A CONCISE, EASY TO READ OVERVIEW OF THE BAHA'I FAITH","Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era is an easy to digest overview of the Bahá'í Faith that includes a thorough yet concise outline of the history and teachings of this, the youngest of the worlds major religions. This book is a ""must read"" for anyone interested in learning the basics of this religion that strives toward unity in diversity under God and elevates such ideas as the elimination of religious and racial bigotry and the parity of rights and freedoms between women and men to the status of divinely ordained law."
2,Cutoff pages,"The scanning in this edition was not well centered and one or more lines were lost from the bottom of each page, including some obviously important sentences. If this problem was fixed, it would be a very valuable resource. As it is, it's worth having, but an aggravating read.This book, in its entirety, is available as a free E-book on Google."
3,Good cookware with two flaws,"Generally speaking, this product is consistent with the comments from my friends. Generating less smoke is the most amazing feature of this product. This product is sturdy and looks nice. There are flaws, though. One flaw is that the cooking pan is sticky, especially when frying eggs. So make sure what you cook is not sticky. The second flaw is the handles become very hot during cooking. In the manual, this 'feature 'has been mentioned. But still, people should pay attention to this problem to avoid injury. Another thing I want to mention is that although the whole package contains 10 pieces, we usually only use 3 of them. Others are redundant in terms of usage."
5,Great Kit,"I've been using these kits for the past few years as they come standard issue in my Army camera kit, I just ordered one for own kit the other day. Comes in a nice case so it's tough to lose the little pieces."
5,Great Details,"This writer takes the reader into the heart of the events unfolding around her. Her descriptions of Hurricane Hattie are stunning. You are there with her. She interjects humor and wit into events unfolding around her and uses commonsense.I thoroughly enjoyed the stories. Although she gives no specific physical description of her grandmother, you see her being feisty and defiant, and her granddaughter exhibits many of her traits.Great stories that show no resentment towards her mother or father.Let's hope she writes a sequel. What happened after she arrived in the USA."
5,Marillion-A Singles Collection 1982-1992,"This video is a must for all North American Marillion fans, cataloging the journey of the band through the eighties with the lead singer Fish, to the spectacular vocals of Steve Hogarth into the nineties. For those with a penchant for keyboards, Mark Kelly's powerful tones carry through in songs such as ""Dry Land"", ""Easter"", and the U.S. hits ""Kayleigh"" and ""Lavender"". I suggest this video as a great gift for those who loved the music of the 80's, including powerful ballads and memorable lyrics. Those who are looking into Marillion for the first time will become hooked as I was by this video."
4,Lord All Mighty,"This CD features alternate takes of songs Elvis recorded at two seperate sessions at 6363 Sunset in Hollywood. The first session was in 1972, where all the songs Elvis recorded related to the dissolution of his marriage, with the exception of ""Burning Love"". A few days after this recording session, Elvis and the band returned to the studio to rehearse songs for the upcoming spring tour. Seven of those rehearsal songs are included here. The rest of the songs date from a 1975 recording session. Elvis was not happy about being forced to record another album. Unlike past recording sessions, where Elvis would record a song over and over until it was perfect, this time Elvis recorded as few takes as possible just to get it over with. I like this CD a lot, and I think other Elvis fans will enjoy it too."
3,Way too expensive,I think a lot of people might be interested in these kind of demos but the price is way too high in my opinion.That's why I haven't bought it until now.
4,The Best in Broadway Sheet Music-Review,This book has a lot of great broadway music in it. The music is easy to sight read and it really has the best of Broadway within it's pages.
2,meh,"I didn't like how it left my hair feeling sticky/oily/gross/what ever. I'm a dude and my hair is black and somewhat course; perhaps these are factors. I was looking for a shampoo product that didn't have ammonium/sodium laurate... props to these guys for providing, but unfortunately this shampoo isn't quite compatible with my hair. In theory though, this is a very skin and body friendly shampoo, so if you've never had a problem with shampoo leaving your hair feeling 'gross' then totally give them a try, otherwise I recomend avoidance."
1,Some Problem.,"I had hard time to start the lawn mower's engine after the replacement with this new air filter. Its seal is slightly oversized and didn't fit without forcing it. Then, when in place, the engine won't start. I checked carburetor, spark plug, gas, plug's wire and cap but eventually it started when the engine was left without this air filter. With the engine running I attempted to put this air filter in place but the engine immediately stalled. I replaced this new filter with the old and dirty but genuine Tecumseh and the engine didn't stall at all. So I bought a new one (genuine Tecumseh 36046) at Home Depot and I solved the problem."
5,Congratulation,"I can recommend this CD all of you who likes perfectly composed music, with the sense that there is a real musical background of this CD. Whenever you feel upset or nervous,listen this music and you will feel much better. If you like listening music and working on your PC in the same time, this CD is highly recommended to you!"
4,"Ignore ""Publishers Weekly""","TURNPIKE FLAMEOUT deserves better than the PUBLISHERS WEEKLY review. I hoped for a moment that the critic meant to type ""wildly diverting"" and that ""mildly diverting"" was a typo, but the whole review is pretty snotty. But again, I've been to a rodeo in (the very real) Cowtown, N.J. and have simple tastes. So it's March 2009 and I've lost my pension: at least I got to laugh out loud while reading this book. Don't let PUBLISHERS WEEKLY keep you from trying this book."
5,Native American Movie Great,This movie is a wonderful Native American Experience. If you loves westerns and Native Americans then you got to love this great DVD! I highly recommend it.
2,DON'T READ THIS BOOK,"This autobiography is more off putting than offseason! It's painfully confessional tone is made worse by its awkward style. Truly the work of an amateur! One wonders what Holoch would come up with as a follow up novel, but we'll never know (at least I hope we'll never know)! The main character is a stereotypically weak female character, pathetically following her love interest across you like impersonal love stories and hackneyed accounts of [lesbians], then this is the novel for you!"
3,It's not what it seems,"Overall this cpu is acceptable for basic needs such as surfing on the internet, checking mail, watching dvds, listening to music etc. But as it is, its not the best cpu unit for playing new basic games, or running multiple applications at once. Another down side is that the video/graphics card doesn't have its own memory. It takes from the system ram. So, if you only have 512mb of Ram for your computer, 64 of it will be allocated to the video card and will not be usable for other programs. I upgraded the ram from 512 to 1 gig and once I upgraded the video card took a 128. So all in all, if you do, do an upgrade to 1 gig, after the allocation to the video memory and allocation of the operating system, you will only have maybe 500 mb of RAM left to do anything else."
4,Just the basics,"It does what it's supposed to do. No bells and whistles. Good for basic computing. DVD Lightscribe is a nice feature. I enjoy making DVDs with a nice label. Media for the Lightscribe is kind of pricey, but it's worth it to me.The verdict is still out on the Vista OS as far as I'm concerned. It's hard to compare to something you've gotten used to over time - XP OS. But I didn't find any major complaints.Why 4 stars instead of 5? I have to really be wowwed to give anything 5 stars!"
3,New computer,"This unit came loaded with Windows Vista, which presents a whole set of challenges, a little quirky, adjusting to the new OS. However, it didn't have enough memory to run it! We had to buy and install more memory just to use the basics. Once that was done, it has been a good system."
3,Not completely lacking,"I thought that overall, this series was worth buying. The sound problem is fixed..for those of you wondering. As for the series, Ruby Wax's character is the only complaint I have..she was a bit irritating, the series is not laugh out loud funny like Ab Fab, but if your a hardcore Ab Fab or French and Saunder's Fan, then you'll want to add this to your collection. The episodes and characters grow on you after you watch them a few times.It's not completely lacking..more of a ""collector's item"" but worth having..but just so you know the episodes are not in order..the company that made this dvd (BFS), is not the brightest..The dvd quality is fine, the sound is fine, but the picture flickers a few times here and there..nothing really noticeable except that the same trivia is on set one and two."
5,my very favorite classical CD,"I was so thrilled to find a more complete recording of Romeo & Juliet; I wanted more than the usual Suite. The selections are perfect -- comprehensive & varied. Young Juliet, Young Romeo, and Nurse are real Prokofiev treats, and the Danse with Mandolins is just wonderful. Interpretation is flawless. The sweeping waves of the final love scene move me every time -- thank you gorgeous trombones! Thank you Mr. Thomas!"
5,Amazing vision,"Michael Tilson Thomas is truly one of the great living conductors. The things he has been doing with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra for a decade now have been wonderful. This is one of the conductor's earliest collaborations with RCA Victor in selections from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet. Although other reviews have summed up most of my feelings on this CD, I do just want to emphasize MTT's musical vision in creating his own suite. The performance is incisive, dramatic, forceful, and thoroughly pleasing. As always, the SFSO plays with totally conviction and total faith in their music director. As one of the leading Russian experts of today, MTT has created here a fantastic disc."
1,RED SEAL???!!!,"As a HUGE classical music fan, this CD does not deserve the RCA red seal. MTT sucks. I live near SF and I will never pay a dime to see him."
4,Good book,"Like some other books on tropical living, this one features some amazing pictures. However, it also boasts floor plans and drawings which really add to the book. Good value too."
3,Not really useful for buiding a dream home.,"I brought this book because I was thinking of retiring to the Philippines.That plan is now on hold, however I found very few ideas that were useful in building my dream home.""A Pattern Language"" by Christopher Alexander et al was really much more useful. It enabled me to see what I wanted to do in a wider context.A very good idea in the Philippines!"
3,Powerful BUT Noisy,"I bought the fan because I like moving air in my room and don't quite like having air conditioning turned on. But although it does move air quite well, it is noisy. Noisier than most fans that I have used before."
1,Beware,"Beware if you are operating certain TV's in the same room. After assembling, we found that anytime we turned on/off, changed channels, or performed any function with our Emerson TV remote, this Honeywell fan came on. Called Honeywell, they said same frequency, too bad, so had to return."
1,Not the same as older models!,"We had two of these fans before and they were great. But this new one, while it looks the same....is NOT the same. It is far louder than the old ones. It is even a slightly different color. The remote control is on a different frequency also. The old remotes would work either of our two old fans but the new one doesn't work with the old fans. Also, our Tivo remote sets the new fan off. It makes it change speeds, etc. After a day or two, we found that to be annoying. We've already replaced the Honeywell with a Lasko remote control model we got at Home Depot for $15 less. This Honeywell fan is being returned."
3,Moves a bunch of air,"Got this fan for my dorm room and was quite surprised by the amount of air it moved. The noise accompanying this air movement didn't bother me too much, and I found the remote control a handy device to have. The main problem with the fan is the amount of noise it produces, as well as a rattle every once in a while that could be distracting. When I attempted to tighten the fan back down in its casing, I was unable to screw the plastic piece holding the fan together back down. Since it was plastic, its threads stripped easily. As such, I haven't been able to use the fan until I find a replacement nut to hold the blades in place, a task which has become much more difficult than I anticipated - the screw doesn't seem to be a very standard size, not 5/16, 3/8, 8mm or 10mm."
2,Only lasted less then 2 years!,"I bought this fan back in 2008 and I really did like it....Now, the motor went out on me and I'm pretty dissapointed concidering I only had it this long! I would probably skip this fan and check on another one! I really thought that Honeywell would have made a better product....Maybe it just happened to be mine or just my luck???"
5,love this fan,"This is the second time i've purchased this particular fan and we just love it.The remote makes it perfect for a bedroom fan as we can turn it on and off,and adjust the speed without having to get up. It is louder then the previousversion, but that does not present a problem for us."
3,Disappointing,"Decent fan, but...1) I could not secure pole to base.2) The Honeywell brand factored heavily in my purchase, yet I've used many noname fans with significant more power.3) I, therefore, suspect the steep price tag is mainly due to the remote, which I don't use."
2,Disappointing,"There's no contest if you're trying to decide between this and the two Philips 2-fers: the Philips recordings are more flowing, better-recorded, and contain more drama and attention to the long line and long argument--so important in Sibelius. Based not just on these but his other recordings recently, Colin Davis seems to be softening in old age. Compare literally any section side by side and you'll find the climaxes here more muted (the tympani is particularly dull and ""thuddy""), the string-playing less taut, and the overall conception far less edgy. The sound is a little fuzzy too. The most interesting item is Kullervo, where Davis fares better than the rest, but overall these strike me at least as anonymous, faceless performances--fat and plummy and boring. Maybe Davis said it all in his first outing with the BSO. I wonder why he felt this set to be necessary. I didn't detect any new insights."
3,Wood is good.,"I saw these guys this week and they put on a good show. The sound is New York city punk/glam with a dash of pop and all fun. The girl on the mic had a ton of energy, really fronted the band well, and filled her t-shirt nicely. I could make band comparisons, but just know that they rock, and will get your body moving if you so choose. Too bad there is currently no US album out, but I heard it's on the way. Oh, and the track ""New York Girls"" and the cover of ""Knock On Wood"" are well worth this price."
5,Powerful pump for fountain and waterfall,"This pump is powerful enough to run both fountain and waterfall. It is very efficient, does not need to be cleaned very often...Was impressed with the price of the pump on Amazon compared to local stores. Delivery was very fast, only four days, and shipping was free. Only negative, the box was damaged in shipment, but the pump and attachments were fine."
3,Sorry for not opening the box sooner,I purchased this item in advance of when I needed it so unfortunately I didn't open the box and check out the product when I received it. The box and packaging looked fine so I assumed the product was OK. 6 weeks later I discovered that the item was damaged. One of the pins holding the unit together was broken. I attempted communication with the seller but I realize that by my own actions I had virtually no chance of any recourse. I decided to just use a twisty tie to keep the unit closed in place of the pin and put the PowerJet into my pond and it works just like I hoped it would. The fountain works perfectly for a small pond.I would have rated the item higher if it had not been damaged. Part of my disappointment is due to the restrictive language on the return policy.
5,Holistic Behavioral Medicine: A New Paradigm for Deseases and Health Care,"A most read. Best knowledge to have to be healthy and stay healthy. The author is a serious, reliable professional to trust. Our health depends on every choice we make and this book provides very clear and practical recommendations for making the right ones for our health."
5,Baldur's Gate 2: The Collection,I love ordering from Amazon online. Extremely reliable. Shipments are delivered in 2 to 4 days. Even third party purchases are reliable. Thanks for your service. Good Game. Having Fun!
5,Its has reaffirmed My Identity,"WE will never know who WE are until we know who HE is. In this book, Brother Humbard shows us both! I grew by leaps and bounds after reading this book! I fully recommend this book! I AM comes before AWESOME GLORY!"
4,12 year old Petula Clark on film,"This movie has become a classic over the years,and film maker Martin Scorsese raves about the film. A must see for anyone who loves british movies ,scotland,and any Petula Clark fans who want to see her in a non singing role aged 12"
3,Did we ever see this?,"Supposedly I purchased this, and given the description, it's not impossible. However, I don't remember it all, which should tell you that either I didn't purchase it or it was utterly forgettable and definitely not something I'd purchase again."
5,A nearly forgotten classic,"My wife saw this on local TV one night and was so entranced that I bought her the DVD. She considers it in the bracket of those very few classics we can watch over and over again and each time you enjoy it more. It's a carefully restored old English movie set in the Scottish highlands and starring Wendy Hillier (the original Eliza Doolittle in G B Shaw's ""Pygmalion"") and Roger Liversey, who created the character of Colonel Blimp in another great English movie of the early 1940s. Both are brilliant in a cast of genuine characters straight from the pages of Robbie Burns. Such movies are what we need today to counter the troubles of this world with music, laughter and love that liftsI Know Where I'm Going! - Criterion Collectionthe spirits."
5,I Know what I liked,"This is a great movie. The Scots are portrayed as with the proper blend of charm, wit, eccentricities, and wisdom.The message is timeless.The film still works today. Easily in the top 5 all-time for my wife and me."
5,A Wonderful Film,"When I saw this film in 1946, I was just a teenager...WhenI was able to tape it off the PBS station in 1986...I found the film was just as good then as it was when I first saw it. I also fell in love with Scotland!!!..Now that I have it on DVD with the extras...I love the film and Scotland even more..."
2,Channel works,"I have read this book some years ago as I believe that channel works. However, I was not impressed with the author's sketchy views about channels. In live trading, we can get self-sabotaged if the set of beliefs about the market is not clear nor logical. You ought to know more.Channels are overlapped. Channels are nested. The usefulness of channels is to extend them into the future. You should recognize a channel in the making before its trend line can be draw. The major character of channels is their slope. Slope can be flatten or steepen before the channel turns into another channel into opposite direction. Price bounds between the left and right boundaries of channels. Inside channel, the volume trend direction relates to the price trend. figure them out one by one you can make trading a piece of cake."
1,These other reviewers are overly generous,"Basic stuff. Channels and how to use them. Wow, that's original!And many of his charts have so many lines to try to (in retrospect) explain channel changes and justify what you can see in retrospect (the ultimate in curve fitting by eyeballing a line to past data). I was actually laughing out loud looking at these completely messed up charts.I am not holding myself out to be an ""expert"" (though as one esteemed reviewer who has claimed this is one of the top 3 our of the hundreds of trading books he has read) I would counter that this is one is in the worst decile of the hundred's of trading books that I have read.There is some useful info for beginners, but mostly it is a waste of money. I feel bad writing such an awful review as I am sure the author is knowledgeable and sincere, but the book sucks."
3,Okay but informative,I don't feel like this book is the greatest but it was functional and gave good information.
2,not the best...,"The book took forever and a day to get here. It was within the shipping days, but I have never had a book through amazon take so long. Also the book was listed as like new or very good cant remember, but when I recieved the book there was highlighting all through out that book that was not revealed in the description."
1,Slow and Part Faulty,It took much longer to receive the item than expected. The first test (out of 20) that I used was faulty. I took a second test the exact same way and it worked fine so I know it wasn't an error on my part. I have ordered the exact same tests from different companies and been much happier.
5,Wondfo HPT,"Great tests! There were no evap lines! Every test was stark white, I will buy them again for next cycle!"
4,booster seat,This seat is very manageable as far as installing in my 2005 S40 Volvo. Be careful that the seat belt is secure and tighten is well.
4,Shoe Dryer,Nice item. I use these to keep my work boots dry in my locker at work. I plug these in once per week to renew them. They are not practical as a shoe stretcher.
3,Nice toy,It is good quality and the fried eggs inside are cute. My children did wet one of those fried eggs and now it is a bit hard but I would still recommend for a fun time. The truth is my kids use them for other things instead of just the race.
4,great fun,My preschooler child loves to play with it. I guess it does teach him coordination. The material is durable and all in all it was a good purchase.
4,iplay egg and spoon,This is a good way to keep kids active without having to clean up the broken egg of real spoon/egg relay races.
3,Fun Game,The concept is awesome but the eggs do not break open unless on a hard surface. We played the games on the grass and they did not crack open when dropped. My children like this and think it is fun.
5,SUCH a fun toy!,"We borrowed this toy from our local state run lending library months ago. I thought it could only be purchased through an educational toys company which had a higher price plus shipping. I was so excited to find it here on Amazon at a good price & eligible for the free super saver shipping! The coolest thing about the toy is that when you do drop your egg, it actually cracks open & spills out the white & the yolk of the egg! I have seen kids from 2-6 love this toy & of course I had to give it a try too. :) Plan on lots of laughter!"
3,You mess me up,"Another ""post-Factory label"" effort, this album contains some good, if not particularly interesting music. Mixing actual dance rhythms with Vini's typical guitar playing, ""Fidelity"" is similar to 1990's ""Obey the time"", but less innovative and electrifying. And I've never been a lover of these childish female vocals. Take this album as a good first purchase for new fans, but as part of the largely brilliant Durutti Column oeuvre, ""Fidelity"" is a disappointment."
2,uninspired,"it's hard to describe and/or quantify, but vini's guitar playing seems a bit less inspired on this CD. i grit my teeth in saying that, considering that DC is one of my all-time fave bands...but add to that the baby-doll vocal stylings of elli rudge and a few missteps into electronica, and you're left with what amounts to a hodgepodge of a record. for completists only."
5,Cute Toy,Cute toy of a high quality. My little Shih Tzu loves it and it is beyond a doubt his favorite. It makes a rooster sound when you squeeze it.
4,Timex GPS,"I bought this GPS for running because I didn't like the clunky watches, and the price was reasonable. The unit is very accurate, but it does lose the satellite feed if I am running in a area with a lot of trees. Also, it takes about five minutes to pick up a satellite feed when I first go out. The Timex watch that goes with the GPS unit is easy to use and has more functionality that I'll ever need. Overall, it's a good value."
2,Bad signal,Here is my review:Pros : N/ACons :- large for the propose- weak signal - loose signal many times even if you are in open area with clouds.- it does not get the altitude information- it takes more then 5 minutes to get the signalSuggestion: buy a Garmin Forerunner 305 insteady of Timex
3,Big and Bulky,"We bought this booster for our soon to be three year old. It is really, really, big. We intended to take it on a flight, but opted for his sister's covertible instead (she's still a lap child) and checked his. Thank goodness we did! This seat would have not fit in the airplane seat comfortably. He already puts his feet on the seat in front of him, but he would have been kicking the person in front of him in this chair.It's a nice fit for him with plenty of room to grow. My biggest issue is the size. It barely fits in my sedan. I even had to move the seat up so it didn't squish his legs. Other than that, it seems pretty safe and relatively comfy for him."
2,great seat but too big,"I loved it when I took it out of teh box and put my son in it, he looked so comfy and the straps were so easy to adjust. Well then I went to install and it is simply too large, we have a new caravan and it just wont fit on the caption chair so it is going back. The staff at Amazon were great when I called to return it!"
3,Very tall car seat!,"The car seat seems comfy and roomy, but because of the recliner option, the car seat is about 3 inches taller than our other carseat. I have a Jeep Cherokee and I have to fold my 3 year old in half to get him in the car seat."
3,styrofoam back easily accessed and broken,"I like this car seat except for that the styrofoam back was easily broken in half by my toddler, while he was climbing about in the (parked) car one day (I was cleaning the car interior!). All he had to do was pull up the stretchy fabric cover---which is just pulled over the frame, not secured in any way, and grab the styrofoam frame that cushions the back. The styrofoam is loosely attached to the frame and easy to pull up and break. Graco does sell a replacement---$14.95 including shipping---but what a hassle!"
4,GIGANTIC....,"HUGE! if you have a big car it's fine. it's nice that it reclines, but the sides of it are really high... when you sit beside the baby, you have to lean over to look at him, coz you cant see him from the side. overall though, i would still say it is worth it because of the reclining mechanism."
4,Baby gets theater seating,"We've been using this seat for couple of weeks now and it seems to be a very good seat. It's well made and I can't imagine a baby getting more protection than this seat affords. I base this on the anchoring system and strap ajusting mechanisms this seat uses. My car offered the three-point anchors in the seats, so attaching this seat to my car was a breeze.The best thing for my curious child is that she can now see over the front seat and get a view of the road. This has quited her down in the car noticeably. I don't know if the other car seats we looked at would have sat our baby this high, but it's been a plus for us.Highyl recommend this seat. It's worth the extra buck to have piece of mind."
1,SafeSeat Ionic - disappointment,"We purchased this after reading reviews in the most recent Baby Bargains book by Fields. It had strong reviews. We returned it after a 2 week trial run. It was so heavy, my wife could barely lift it. It was so large that our (skinny) two year old barely had enough room for his legs behind the passenger seat of our mid-size sedan. Finally, whatever the material is - it looks cool, but made our kid sweat like crazy. We thought we would try it and save some $$$ instead of buying another Britax for the 2nd car. After we returned it, we bought another Britax after all and are very happy with our final decision. Save yourself a lot of trouble and do not buy this carseat."
5,Great Seat!,"This is the 2nd Step 2 SafeSeat I have bought. It's my daughter's primary seat in my car and my husbands. The recline feature is great, it comfortable, the straps never get twisted. I haven't had an issue with either seat having the wings break off. It is a big car seat, but it fits in my Liberty and Tacoma just fine. Will be buying two moer of these for my son when he can be in a forward facing seat."
2,poor shipping box,"I ordered this product, but it arrived with both ends of the carton broken open. I would suggest that it be purchased from a retail store. The box is not made to withstand UPS shipping."
2,Save yourself a headache,"The Box for this seat is by no means strong enough to handle the abuse they get in transit. You will end up with damaged product. I order this chair for our 1 year old, and on first attempt box arrived half open with missing part (Cup Holder). After calling customer support they sent me a 2nd chair, once more the box was damaged, and the fabric of the chair was torn. I end up returning both chairs, and buying it form a store!"
1,Not American Natives,"I was interested in creating a native woodland. This book does not indicate which plants are native and which are imports and many of them are. There are even invasive plants mentioned with no warning. If you care about protecting our native population of plants from exotics that can out-compete them(and everyone should) then this is the wrong book! The sub title is ""planting in harmony with nature"". What a joke."
5,Quality Scores at a Fair Price,"These scores are great to conduct from and for score study. The notation is very clear and easy to read, and the binding has held up well. I am very pleased with this purchase and cannot think of a criticism for this edition."
4,no measure number,"th score dose not have rehearsal number. It will be ok to use for reference, but is not a good score to use for rehersal."
5,Dvorak's AMAZING New World Symphony,"I played a shortened version of this piece with my high school Jr Band. Then, we played it in Sr band, and finally got to see it performed by the Clevland Symphony Orchestra. Wow. I wouldn't think a piece of classical music, normally considered snooze material, would have such an impact. We were inspired and awed. We felt the music, especially since we've played it. The speed, agility and variring nature of the piece brings you up in the 1st section... slows you down in the second with beauteous harmony... brings the pace back up in the third for the final heart-wrenching finish. Buy this piece!!! You'll be happy you did!!!"
5,Es grandiosa!!!,"La 9a Sinfonía de Dvorak es un gran ejemplo de perfección en la escritura sinfónica: 4 movimientos constructurados (el tercero un scherzo), esta sinfonía fué compuesta para un viaje de Dvorak a los Estados Unidos, toda la fuerza y delicadeza que implica la ejecución de esta sinfonia debe ser estrictamente perfecta. La dulzura del segundo movimiento logra el efecto para el cual fue escrito, es una gran sinfonía!!!."
4,This game started the path,to loving RPG games. It was a great little game in its day and led to a computer game addiction that continues still.
1,"Bad DOS, Bad DOS.........","I found out very fast why I hate playing games that still have access to the DOS system. I have played quite a few games via DOS, and never really liked it because we had to keep loading DOS and then restarting computer, but you get the idea. This game, StoneKeep, I guess would be a good game if it wasn't misleading. It says that it works on Win 95, 98, 2000 and Win ME. Well, I don't really know as we have a new Gateway, and it doesn't really like playing DOS games. Either that, or after trying for an hour, I just gave up. But, if you enjoyed it, I'm glad that you were able to. I wasn't, but just wanted to let others know that this game is slightly misleading. If anyone cares to find out what other games that I have used, played, owned, feel free to contact me at:DruHawke@msn.comEnjoy life, chase your dreams, and never be afraid to ask questions."
5,One of the BEST RPG Games...,"I purchased this game a while back and was immediatly hooked on it. Included in the game is a book that gives you something of a Prequel feel. This game makes you think, makes you wonder, and you wont want to stop. Everything from Might to Magic, and more. Start by fighting Ants, end by Fighting a God. And we cant forget Wahooka, the ever annoying (and ugly) king of the fairies. This game is a MUST have for ANY true gamers collection. The Box alone is worth the price. Anyways, if you havent played it yet, buy it, it's well worth it."
4,Quite enjoyable for its time,"Although not on my list of all-time favorites, Stonekeep was fun, with impressive graphics for its time, a solid interface, and good old gritty dungeon explorin'. I played about 2/3 of the way through it, and that's impressive, since I'm not the most patient player."
4,Stonekeep is a Keeper,"An interesting game style, storyline, and overall gameplay. I played this game a few years ago and still recall it as a good game. The graphics were good at the time and still are, the sound and sound track were well put together. Enjoyed many an hour and loss of sleep hackin' away at this little number. For the price now, I would definitely pick it up as part of your gaming warehouse."
2,"Informative, but boring","The book ""flights of the mind"" by charles Nicholl, it one that has a lot of research behind it. I respect that, although when reading, I found a few problems. First of all, nicholl throws facts at you like a text book, and so you can lose track of where you are, and how it adds to Leonardo's legacy. Nicholl also tended to get sidetracked when explaining in depth something that had nothing to do with Leonardo. He also made a lot of assumptions that I feel he didn't make. I think he used a lot of information directly from other books, not that theirs anything wrong with that. He also would at times begin to repeat himself. The book had a huge amount of information within it. I found it was hard to pick out the important information and the information added as an overall picture. All in all, the book was heavy in facts, but with this it became a chore to read."
1,Reads like a text book,"I was looking to learn more about this fascinating man. This book gave me details, but really no story. It was a laborious read. It read like a text book. It is filled with so many facts, that you lose track of what da Vinci accomplished. Really a waste of time."
3,Ghost Hunters: International... send all the bad ones overseas,"Well, the new crew is pretty hard to get used to. I have always thought Brian was a bit hard to believe... it doesn't help that they've teamed him with a leader that acts a little wanky... He acts a little too gung ho. I figure he'll try to build credibility that way."
1,Why downloads...why not on DVD??,I for one am disappointed that GHI is only available as downloads. I am not a fan of these. I really want to see GHI on DVD. Come on people!!
2,A serious mismatch of artists and repetoire,"I've listened to this album repeatedly and can find little to recommend it. The playing is, for the most part, soft focus, with retrained dynamics, slow tempi, and little understanding of the ethnic music basis of Bartok's composition. On the other hand, the performance of the 5th quartet, which was the last recorded, is good. However, there are much better two disc sets of the six Bartok quartets by the Berg, Emerson, Keller, and Takacs Quartets. Similar reservations apply to the performances of the Janacek quartets."
4,Things that make you go Hmmm......,My husband and I had a good time doing these two books. Most of the questions were things that I really had to think about and a few of the questions I just had no idea what they were. A real conversation starter.
5,Do You Know Your Husband?,"You'd think after 28 years of marriage you'd know everything about the man you married. Not! This was a fun eyeopener and worth the time to do together with the companion book ""Do You Know Your Wife?"" We both got the same number of questions ""wrong""!! had to laugh about that one. Worth doing just to learn about each other....especially the younger days that we don't tend to share once we're married."
4,The Parables of Christ in their proper context.,"This author is quickly becoming one of my favorites. His study of the Second Temple Period along with his insighful parallels between Judaism and Christianity are worth more than gold in my opinion. In this book, Young examines Christ's parables from both the Jewish and Christian perspective. What I like about this book is that it helps the reader obtain the correct context of the readings, something that I push for with fervor. Just published, this book is a good read and an excellent resource for future study."
4,Excellent resource,I have used this book as a resource in teaching an adult Sunday School class series on the parables of Jesus. It provides detail on the Jewish environment of Jesus' time and a perspective not found in the usual Bible study materials.
5,Great start!,"This book is a great start to help square yourself against the centuries of misinterpretation of Jesus' message, because of the missing components of Jewish tradition and culture in their analysis."
1,Too much for the scholar.,This book was not what I expected. It is not written for the layman but for the scholar and was not useful for my need.
1,Not Good,"I did not enjoy this book and would not recommend it. It violates Christ's words: John 7:16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me. Mr. Young tries, and fails, to put Christ into his proper cultural and historical context. I love learning about the historical context of the Bible, but this work de-glorifies the omniscience of Christ and His Holy relationship with His Father. Being continuously in intimate union with His Father, and being taught by His Father, Christ NEVER relied upon the wisdom of men, to be His reference point in any or all of His teachings. ""I have given them Thy Word"" was the all sufficient prayer of our Great High Priest.Save your money for another author."
2,It isnt what I waited!,"The jewish tradition about parables are an effort to defigure the Christ meaning. Rabi's wisdom never will be the same of Jesus, the Messiach, Son of God!"
1,Outdated scholarship,Young seems unaware of what has been going on in the world of New Testament scholarship for the past 50 years. The only valuable part of the book consists of the later Jewish parallels.
4,Very Good Sulfate/Paraban Free Shampoo,"I've been looking for a good sulfate & paraban free shampoo that doesn't dry out my hair. I've always liked Kiss My Face products and this shampoo didn't disappoint me. I have found that not all sulfate free shampoos are created equal for my hair. I have to use moisturizing sulfate free shampoo, otherwise my hair absolutely fries!!!! This shampoo helped to pull my hair out from a very bad, bad place and I will definitely order it again."
5,heart grabbing movie,This was a wonderful movie would rate it a 10 if I could. The service was excellent and would differently buy from you again.thanksPam
2,curse words....a spoiler,"If you don't care for curse words of any kind, scattered even a bit within a movie, you won't care for this movie. Curse words is the spoiler for me in this one. It always wrecks an otherwise good movie. Don't know why those words have to be included cuz it wrecks a movie every time. I would have expected this movie to be different, being that Amy Grant is in it, but it was again too much to ask, it seems. So sad."
3,Nicely done,"We needed a good family movie, and we grew up as fans of Amy Grant. The movie was nicely done, and is clean and wholesome, and good for the family. My kids enjoyed it and it made for a good family movie night."
1,A Song from The Heart ?,"I came upon this movie by accident while channel surfing. I was curious enough to watch. I was bored to tears. This movie was sappy to say the least. Ms. Grant is definitely not an actress ! Her performance was hollow, with little or no emotion.She acted as if she was reading from a teleprompter . The story line was not inspiring nor entertaining. The characters relationships did not evolve as one would expect from a ""love"" story. This entire movie was a waste of time ! It just didn't work . I would not only not purchase it, I would definitely not torture myself by watching it again !"
3,A Song from the Heart,This product is not one I purchased so didn't know what to do about the rating. I don't know how it got on my review page
2,Disappointing,"I'm surprised this movie is rated so high. Amy seem like a nice person in the role, but she wasn't convincing in the character of Mary Ann. The supporting cast around her was pretty decent, however.I agree with another reviewer who was disappointed by the cuss words which, for me, removes it from the ""clean"" movie category. I think part of my disappointment was that Amy didn't use her gift of singing in the movie (which would have likely earned another star).Though I appreciate a good ""sweep off the feet"" romance, I did appreciate the take on what real love looks like. Shown in the character of Oliver, it is patient, kind, not rude (with the exception of his obvious rivalry with ""the other man""), not selfish or boastful... present in time of need."
4,Great cast!,"This movie has a great cast...a great story and tugs at your heart! The music/orchestra is extraordinary as well. Sometimes in life, we have something right in front of us that we don't even realize until painful circumstances bring it to the fore front...this is one of those movies that have a touching ending...an ending I could live with! Have watched it over and over again!"
4,Song from the Heart,I love music and if you just be still......what you are looking for may have been right there all the time.
4,Pretty Good,This movie in my opinion is just a really good movie. Relaxing feel good movie. Thought the story line was good and the acting as well.
5,An essential read for those interested in golf course design,"Donald Ross was the pivotal figure in the establishment of golf as a recreational sport in the U.S. His courses remain as challenging today as they were during his times.This book gives the reader insights into how to view a course with a critical eye. And after reading it, one can quickly identify the trademark features of a Ross design and perhaps score a little better on it.The book also provides a comprehensive listing of courses.--The man who is going to play every Donald Ross course."
2,not that spectacular,"I wanted to return it but never did. Cheap material... the color is great though, and thats why I got it."
4,"Jonas, the magnicent!","Despite a very uninteresting production, I really enjoyed this DVD, mainly because of the wonderful singing of Jonas Kaufmann! He has got to be the greatest tenor of our time. He sings and acts with such sensitivity, emotion and intelligence and it is such a beautiful sound ! Sophie Koch sings a nice Charlotte but in closeups her facial expressions are somewhat offputting! The minor parts are all well done - but the whole opera revolves around Werther himself and he is amazing!"
5,On Time for Xmas,"I ordered this DVD right before Xmas and I was worried about getting it, but the order was processed right away and it arrived in plenty of time. I am very pleased with the service."
2,"Great performances, terrible video work","Werther is a drama made for close ups and mid shots, not shots from the back of the opera house, and shots of the conductor's back. Camera work is important, vital in presenting these operas on DVD, but we who view the DVDs are NOT there and we don't need to be there in the opera house; we do not need to see the audience or the prompter or the conductor, only the filmed opera as a film really, without the amateur experimentation with a video camera crew, as we have here, that seriously detracts from these artists' singing and from our involvement in it.It was easier to listen to this performance without paying attention to the video portion,exactly why I purchased this..to hear it only!Avoid this, and let the video artists know that they are secondary. Let the singers know too that they should be able to see samples, for example, of the dress rehearsal filmed and make judgments."
4,Weird camera angles,"Saw this on Arte and agree that the weird camera angles destroy the dramatic tension at key moments. The person editing apparently does not realize that when the hero is singing, the camera should show him, not a reaction shot of the heroine that obscures his face, and not the orchestra playing. I can't see any point in showing the actors off stage before they get into their parts, either. Breaking the fourth wall is simply a mistake. I've disliked the Met's HD camera work, but this is actually far worse. It's ironic that when for once the two leads are very photogenic, the camera doesn't want to take advantage of that.The singing is beautiful. If Jonas Kaufmann weren't so romantically handsome and perfect visually for the part, I'd say just get the audio on this. But there is great power in his acting to be enjoyed, if one can ignore the stupid camera angles."
2,Not a fan of charcoal incense,"Charcoal incense is basically dipped in scented oil. Personally, I don't care for it because the smoke is heavy and strong and it hangs in the air unpleasantly. You can smell oil burning. It's not a clean, consistent scent compared to non-charcoals."
3,Not the original air play hits.,"The artists may be real but at least one of the recordings is not the original. I don't really understand how you pull that off with a group from 1964 but live and learn. I purchased this CD for ""(Just Like) Romeo & Juliet"" by the Reflections. It is not the original ""air play"" version but then again there was no information stating that the recordings were original, enough said."
2,Endless egotistical conceit overshadows this biography,"Remove Toller's sophomoric elements and the book would only have a small fraction of pages remaining. It has some of what happens behind the competitive and touring scenes. Still, though, the incessant self-touting never ceases to become bothersome. We're of the understanding that Toller claims to be a native Canadian. Read this and he comes across more as the worst brazen, and self-centered American. Really, those that enforce totalitarian indoctrination must have him as a poster child."
1,Only readable for the mildly humorous writing style,"What a disppointment! As other reviewers have stated, I too enjoyed Mr. Cranston's skating. I had read this in anticipation of his new book coming out, but now I will save my money.There are some moderately interesting descriptions of skating tours in Japan and Central America. There are some vague descriptions of salacious or bizarre encounters with famous people. It should be a lot more interesting than it is. But Mr Cranston fails to make his era live for the reader, and he fails to offer any analysis of his decisions, making the book essentially pointless. Furthermore, any humor he achieves is ruined by two parallel themes: How great and Artistic Toller is, and how much he has Suffered. These themes were singularly unconvincing. ..."
4,This is definately Toller!,"An interesting look into the mind and life of Cranston. The figure skating world is shown, warts and all. Toller is definately THE most innovative and influential skater that has come along in this century."
4,"Interesting if it's not quite ""non-fiction""","Toller is his own unique person, and some of his anecdotes are extremely funny. It's not something you'll finish (or want to finish) in a night, but it's an interesting read for the mere fun of it."
3,Good Case...not to sure about the car straps,Bought this case at the same time a bought a dvd player for my 20 months old for are car trips. My husband had a tough time securing the case to the back of our headrest; after much fidgeting it still didnt seem to secure. I am not sure if it is because of the particular headrest we have or not. Needless to say we didn't use it on our recent road trip and just let our daughter hold her dvd player. We will try again to make it work. That being said it fit our dvd player perfectly.
2,Never had a chance to use it ) :,This case did not look the one pictured. Is that a different model? Plus the straps with the hook ends to secure the case to the seat were missing and not included. It arrived in a plastic zip lock bag inside the box. No original packaging? Disappointed. Sent it back for a refund. My case search continues.....
4,"Haven't used in car yet, but it's great storage","The DVD player and all it's gear fit nicely into the holder with some room to spare for at least one DVD case. I didn't expect there to be tons of storage for DVDs. It seems to hold the player securely. We haven't used it as a portable holder in the car yet. So, I'm not sure how easy it will be to attach and use. However, I expect it to go well. It makes a great storage case at such a great affordable price. It seems to be made of good quality material and stitching."
4,Great case,The portable DVD fits perfectly...a little hard to install into the car and not very easily to remove...but a very nice product!
3,it could be operator error...,i like the features of the case but to be honest i have yet to find away to get it to stay where i want it too. it could be operator error but I am not so sure.It's always difficult to find universal cases that work as advertised though.
3,High expectations....big dissapointment,"It does what it supposed to do, however, it is cumbersome to attached, not as pictured.I now use it as a case to store the DVD player and to move it to and from the car.I am going back to my previous method, 3 cable ties joined around the base of the head rest. Secure and cheap."
2,Cheap and that's what you get,This bag is inexpensive and that's the product you get. It's much thinner and has no protection at all. If you just want a lightweight case and don't need padded protection for a cheap price then you will like this. Other than that I wish now I would have spent a little more time researching first and maybe even spent a few extra dollars on a more secure bag.
4,Pretty good case,"For the price, this is a pretty good dvd player case. It can be a little tricky mounting it to a car seat (even trickier suspending it between 2 car seats) but not impossible. It seems pretty durable and adequately padded. I only wish that it had a little more storage capacity. With the dvd player and all the accessories (power cord, case mounting straps, etc.) loaded in the bag there is almost no room to carry any dvds. But, with a price so much lower than all the other cases i looked at, I'm not complaining."
4,A peaceful car ride,"Item arrived packaged well and on time. I was able to hook it to the back of the seat without issue. I was actually surprised that it was as easy as it was. The only down fall was that the soft cushion material the case is made of muffled the volume. I cut a piece of plastic and placed it under the dvd player, which helped solve that problem."
4,Good for the Money,It can be used in both travel and car attachment. It is very useful. It has more compartment for storage.
4,Nice case,The case was just as it was advertised. The only drawback is that I wish it had separated compartments for multiple DVD's
3,wish it were a little bigger,"It's a nice case, but I bought it for a 7"" DVD/TV and it just fits inside. I wish it had more room. Even if it were a little deeper, to hold the charger & antenna better. Everything fits, but just fits."
5,Portable DVD Player Case,This is one of the best cases I have found to house the DVD player I ordered the same day. The player fits perfectly without being too tight to zip it up. I can always find just what I need at Amazon.com.
4,Does What It Needs to Do,"Our family likes this case for our 7 inch portable DVD player. We can fit almost everything we need into the case. We also used the case in our 4-door pickup truck back seat for the kids. Even though the front seats do not have separate head rests, like cars, we were still able to use the straps in a manner that mounted the case between the 2 front seats for the kids to view.As in other reviews that I have read, the only problem that I can see with this case is that the top side of the case does not open quite far enough to open the DVD player screen completely. Although this is a bit awkward, the movie could still be viewed. So I still like the case overall."
3,Not quite as pictured.,"Unit shipped does not have the adjustable web pieces on the sides as pictured. Good price for $16, but wish it was as pictured. Would make it easier to orient the screen for viewing in the back seat.Also, the velcro closure that holds in the DVD player isn't very good quality and is starting to come apart.I thought about returning it. May still do so."
1,"Does not work with 8"" Audiovox!","I don't know why they advertise this case with the Audiovox. It does not fit with the battery attached, which of course makes it useless! Just beware of the size of your unit in both length and depth."
3,It's ok...,"It's ok, but my son always seems to end up kicking it and closing the dvd player, then he get mad."
3,"Good case, not great",This case was ok. The dvd player I have barely fits and I have to get the player out to exchange the power cords between home/car. I also have to make this maneuver to turn the power on/off since the switch is on the side. It was also hard to attach the case between the seats of the car. It wanted to swing back and forth and was hard to adjust for proper viewing. It works great when you attach it directly to the back on one seat insteand of putting it in the middle.
1,Great for storage and that's it!,DVD player would not stay in place with the stap when set up on the back of the car seat. Good amount of storage for DVD player and all the accessories. Needs improved design to keep DVD player in place while setup in the car. I would not buy this again or recommend to a friend.
2,Useless,Useless and complicated...doesn't really work with four attachments points...needs 6 to be stable. It collapses under the weight of the DVD player.
3,Well crafted but small,"We took it on a long car trip that required us to carry all of the dvd player accessories. There isn't enough room in the bag for the car charger, wall charger, remote and headphones not to mention any movies. Ended up with two bags instead of one for all the stuff. it's a nice case to keep the dvd player safe and dust free but don't plan on putting anything more in there besides a remote."
4,Good product,Great little DVD/ TV only complaint is the antenna provided will not work on the move so don't plan on using this in a car without separate purchase of better antenna
3,"Interesting, but no support!","I enjoyed this game thoroughly -- until I got to a serious bug about a third of the way through, when I suddenly discovered that SouthPeak is no longer supporting this game. No patches, no saved games, and no help whatsoever. Extremely frustrating, since I had played just enough to get really hooked, and then whammo! Cut off.So if you buy it, be aware that you're on your own if you have a problem."
5,Dark Side,"This game is way better than I expected. You play from 6 discs, so if you don't like to change discs, don't get it. The graphics and audio and videos are fantastic. Everything you work with is viewed on one screen. Extremely user friendly. Great scenery and colors. Just started this, but really like it already."
1,You'll be disappointed,"Save your money. Don't buy this game. I was not able to get the dialogue conversation to work (heard the conversation but could not answer people because the words wouldn't appear to click on). I couldn't save the game because the tab to click on wouldn't work so I had to shut my computer down (the control,shift,delete wouldn't do it either). I called tech support and they said the game was discontinued by Southpeak and they could not help me. I called Southpeak and they apologized, but they said it's been discontinued for years and there was nothing they could do for me. They claim my computer is too fast for the game to work since the game is so old. Isn't that wonderful!!! So, please don't bother getting this game even though it's so cheap -- that's why it's so cheap."
3,"Handy, usable, portable although slightly inaccurate and can tip easily","Came in packaged well and easy to assemble in less than a minute (with a Philips screwdriver).Gives good information about latitudes (with highlighted equator), longitudes, political boundaries (slight inaccuracy here because disputed territories, I feel, should be marked so rather than making it a part of one country or the other) and goes to the extent of marking trade winds and their directions.May not be sturdy as it is light (some weight on the base could have helped) and has a little overlap error where the map sheath/layer edges meet but, is very good value for money overall.I specially liked the physical features (mountains) shown by raised relief features."
2,Low quality globe,"The relief on this globe was off by a good inch when measuring at the equator, meaning mountain ranges were in the wrong places. The stand was pretty wobbly, and it was nearly impossible spin the globe quickly because it was so light and the stand kind of flimsy. If you need a quick globe and don't care about quality, this one would work, but if you want one to keep for years and to be accurate then buy something more expensive and of a different brand."
4,EXplorer Globe,"I purchased the Replogle Explorer Globe for my seven year old grand daughter. The globe is excellent with latest political maps (it shows North Sudan and South Sudan as separate countries.)Even though the base looks flimsy and a bit wobbly, it works fine and any issues with base are easily fixed. Good return for the money. Ideal for class or home use."
4,Explorer Globe,"The globe was nice but I thought that I should have spent more and had a better quality. In the center where the two halves are joined together, it is very obvious that there is tape present. It is not very smooth."
4,Good,"A few of the lines do not match up - other than that, is good - appears to be the only game in town at a reasonable price!"
5,Quality of Globe,The Globe was packaged very good .I could not of asked for a better product for the price of the Globe .I Love the way it has rises on some of the places .The stand is very pretty .The globe is larger then i expected. The only thing i think that would of helped with this globe is having a little more weight to it .But i would advise and one who is looking for one to get this like i said its great
5,"12"" Raised Relief Explorer Globe",It's amazing how much a child learns by having access. We are an American family living in Germany and felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we live and where our extended family lives.
5,Explorer Globe evaluation,"Up-to-date borders between countries. The base is too light and flimsy. The northern and southern halves do not fit together exactly. Still, good value for the modest price."
4,Sad but very helpful,"I'd say this book gets you as close to knowing what it feels like to lose a loved one in a tragic accident without it actually happening. Althought it hurt to read it, it helped me in a lot of ways too. I've thought about what I would do if I lost my husband, and she touches on most of the things I have thought about. Only negative is that there is a bit of repetition throughout the book and a little out of sequence in some parts."
2,It doesn't swing,"I love the Canadian Brass, especially doing Bach. But they should stay clear of jazz. The musicians don't and apparently can't swing! The opening cut, Stan Kenton's ""Artistry in Rhythm,"" is one of the least inspired renditions of the piece I've ever heard. Things get worse. At one point we are exposed to a 1950 recording featuring Roy Eldridge, playing, it seems, in another room. Brubeck's ""Blue Rondo a la Turk"" is just embarrassing, especially the trombone solo. Avoid this one, jazz fans."
3,KInd of cute,I purchased this video for my students who read Rip Van Winkle. It was appropriate for my special education students.
1,watch something else,"This has to be the wrost movie I ever saw. ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" was a master piece compared to this movie (Terror In The Pharaoh's Tomb). Some movies are so bad that they can be funny. Not this one. It looked like it was made on a PC from the 80's by someone who didn't know how to use it. If this movie ever comes on TV with no commercials and you have nothing else to do, don't watch it."
1,Terror In The Pharaoh's Tomb,"Terror In The Pharaoh's Tomb (2007)This was absolutely abysmal and also a scam. The movie was so rotten, I threw away the disc and only saw 1/3rd of it. Novices on U-Tube could do a better job! Lon Chaney, George Zucco and others are used as a come along. This is unethical. The movie is soap opera formatted, then old reels are thrown in, such as scenes from actual movies the above stars were in. Slapped together garbage. This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen out of thousands of movies. I couldn't be more disappointed. Anyone who sells this movie knowing its worthlessness is unethical. In addition, it was made in 2007."
1,"1 star is too high, but Amazon doesn't have a 0 star selection","This title I found to be rather self serving and a thinly veiled attempt for the author to make himself out to be something of a romantic. The reader would have been better served with a title such as ""My Three Failures: Or How I Am The Real Bitch"". Much in the way ""Big Al"" welcomes a new cellmate, his ""Bitches"" have shown him who was the real man in the relationship, but who is to blame for that?I would have been more interested in this title if it had come on a roll, such as Charmin or Angel Soft. Do not misunderstand my intent, this by no means can replace the gold leaf toilet paper I have grown fond of, but the literary content of this work would be greatly improved in the process.Kudos to the publisher for limiting this to 1 printing. Shame on them for printing it in the first place (unless the author is the printer, and each of these is a handwritten volume, in which case...caveat emptor)"
5,Roger Whittaker The Christmas Song,I love this CD! It has some of my favorite Christmas music on it. Roger Whittaker's excellent rendition of so many of the songs is unequaled. I have a good collection of Christmas music and I am so pleased to add this CD to my growing collection. I have enjoyed listening to it since I received it and it isn't even the Christmas season yet!
1,Look for something else.,"I bought this item and in two days it busted. Save your money. I'm not a big person, rather on the small size. Normal use-sage, no reasons it should bust. Not worth my time dealing about the product.Lewis N. Clark Inflatable Backrest"
3,:P,"I needed this book for my Introduction to Archaeological Field Methods Class and we hardly use it. But more importantly I bought the book and it said it was in ""Good or Just like New Condition"", and near the end of the book the spine had been split. The book itself is very useful if you want to learn about the ethics and methods of Archaeology."
3,Not a good fit and looked unstable; NO instructions to speak of..,"Not sure what kind of bedframes all the other reviewers have that fit so great with these, but mine did not. I mean, you could get them in there even without instructions (thanks alot )but once in they leaned in because the existing leg on the bedframe did not support them all the way up and the little play in there made them basically unsupported and made them lean in. So, I am unhappy with the lack of instructions and the fact that you need a certain design leg to make them stay upright once you install them. I don't know if I am making this understood well, but just know that it is a gamble if they will work right depending on your bedframe."
2,Not 10 inches,These were good but the rise is only 5 1/2 inches not ten. they due work for my need. They need to buy new ruler made in the USA!
2,Wobbly,"We installed these on a Queen sized bed. The mattress is a 10"" memory foam and the box spring nothing out of the ordinary. It felt wobbly just sitting on the bed."
1,"Very difficult, not sturdy","They didn't keep the bed sturdy, they did not stand straight up, so I returned them. Luckily, the return was easy"
4,Shepherd Adjustable Bed Risers,"Perfect, they did just what I wanted which was to raise my bed up higher off the floor. They were not as stable as I'd like when fully extended, but are fine when adjusted down a bit and still are plenty high after doing so."
3,Nice casters but I couldn't use them and they were not advertised as a pair.,The casters appear to be very sturdy but my casters were not removable so I had to return them. Also the ad does not point out that they are sold in pairs not as singles.
1,mulipet dog toy,This is another of the toys of this brand that did not last but a few minutes. My dog loved the sound it made but it just did not last.Bob
3,Didn't last a day unfortunately,"This is such a great idea...my newly blind dog loved it...but it didn't even last 24 hours before she broke the device that made the noise, and she is just a little terrier mix. I so wish I could recommend this...maybe it was a fluke but sorry to say I won't buy it again. She does still play with it though."
1,Disappointing...,"""The Heart of Motherhood"" is incredibly extreme. What little ""encouragement"" as a busy mother and housewife I found in this book was quickly stamped out by the authors' extreme bias against anyone whose life isn't as perfectly balanced as her own. In fact, I have been extremely offended by many of her views as to what a mother and wife should be, as any woman who has had to work in order to feed and clothe her children would be, and her ignorance and snobbery towards those who have not been as blessed in life as she is is apparent within all she has to say, even as she claims to not be ""condemning or judging"". This book would be better titled ""Quotes from Blessed Teresa of Calcutta and the Popes""."
2,"Awesome voice, lousy recording","Ms. Peters has never been in better voice. Evokes all the right nuances and emotion, from giddy to heartbreaking. The problem is that every high breaks, every low muffled. A sublime performence is undermined by lousy recording and worse transfer. It sounded pretty bad on vinyl, I had hoped the CD mastering would be a correction. I was wrong, and the music was wronged."
1,Who can tell?,"I have never reviewed any item that I gave less than four stars, so this is a first for me. That said, I bought this CD because ""Tell Me On A Sunday"" is one of my all-time favorite songs, and I looked very forward to hearing Bernadette Peters' version of it. What a disappointment! No criticism against Ms. Peters -- I couldn't tell if I liked her version or not. The sound quality on this recording is the worst I have ever encountered. This CD is for me, completely unlistenable."
4,Very enjoyable,"I must agree with the comment that no one knows how to do Bernadette justice on disc. Her unique vocal quality really loses something during the recording process, and this album is no exception. Bernadette has definitley sounded better (check out Into the Woods and Sunday in the Park...), but that characteristic emotional delivery that won her a Tony for this performance is undeniable here. The songs are a whole lot of fun to listen to and sing along with...any Bernadette and/or Lloyd Webber fan will be well pleased with this recording."
2,A star can shine through the thickest sludge,"Song and Dance is without a doubt a bad show. I won't reach for any zinging insults; it isnt worth it. The show is just bad. A dumb story (which, as Frank Rich pointed out, is brimming with overt misogynism) told entirely in Mr. Lloyd Webber's oh-so-special brand of europop. Bernadette Peters actually makes us care what's happening; she is excited, she is upset, she is happy, she is distant, she is wonderful. She needs better material! For every Sunday in the Park with George there is a Goodbye Girl . . . its a shame. Anyway, thank goodness the recording doesn't show off Mr. Lloyd Webber's Paganini variations; the piece is nearly unlistenable, although i didn't expect much more. Do not waste money on this relic of the 80's unless you are a sincere fan of Bernadette Peters. Even then, don't buy it - you will only feel sorry for her."
2,a poor recording of a great performance,"i saw ms. peters in this show. what a mess this recording is. total distortion at the end of both her big ballads. i cannot recommend this cd unless you are going for a complete collection of b. peters recordings. otherwise, skip it."
4,Why will they not re-master this?,This recording is Bernadette Peters' tour de force. If you can listen to it and not cry you're made of stone. I originally had the cassette recording and later bought the CD. The quality of the CD is HORRIBLE. It's blurry and muffled and almost scratchy. Why in the world won't Webber clean it up and re-release it?? All the old records of My Fair Lady and South Pacific and King and I have all been re-mastered and digitized into perfection. It is such a disappointment not have a clear version of this work available.
1,PLEASE take that look off your face,"This is a turkey. Possibly the worst show recording ever made. I like Bernadette Peters, but here she sounds like she's just come in after a night out and can't even be bothered to sing the words. Presumably it's how she was directed. Marginally amusing on stage perhaps, but a loser on disc. Her accent veers around from Dick van Dyke-esque Cockney to Australia via South Africa, and to add insult to injury, the story and lyrics have undergone a dreadful rewrite, including all the textbook stereotypes you could think of about the English (drinking tea, being reserved, how original...), and all the best songs have been butchered. Almost entirely unlistenable. Avoid at all costs."
5,This is the best pasta book ever!!!!!!!!,"I have had great luck in trying most of these incredible recipes. I am usually a horrible cook but this book makes me seem like the spicy son of Wolfgang Puck. This is the single best cookbook of all time, and trust me as a student i've tried them all. I'm hungry now thinking about those wonderful dishes; oh well back to the kitchen."
3,Not very sensitive,"I've been using these over a few months now. They do work, but they aren't very sensitive. And the positive line is fairly light. I tested a few days before I was due to start a cycle. Negative. Tested again a couple of days after, positive. So, no, they aren't sensitive. But if you test on the day you are due to start or later, it should be accurate. But who wants a bunch of tests that aren't super sensitive?? :)"
5,"Lo Mejor del Chapulin Colorado, Vol. 7","Uno de mis personajes favoritos de mi niñez y que mejor que adquirir la colección completa de lo mejor del Chapulín Colorado, aunque hay algunos episodios que no estan incluidos en la colección. Aunque hayan cambiado la musica de fondo, el DVD es recomendable para toda clase de público, ya que hoy en dia los programas de comedia no se comparan con las comedias de los personajes de Chespirito."
1,boring boring,"this movie was a great disappointment,i kept watching to see if it was going to get better,then a just shut it off."
4,GET THE ENGLAND PRESSING!,"This US pressing is good, but inferior to the English one, which has many additional songs, and several vocals with Dinah Shore. The liner notes even include a letter saying that the recording of ""Stardust"" with Glenn and Dinah is ""propoganda.""! Do yourself a favor and search for the English version."
5,Nostalgic but sounds new,"Love this! Great songs, great sound and great variety! Who could ask for more. For the Glenn Miller fan, or anyone who loves Big Bands!"
1,Make up kit,You can buy this item i have seen it before but it is not for tattoos that you would get one your arm or back it is for gurls or guys who want to have their make up on permantly eyebrows or lips so buy this item if you want to have peremant make-up otherwise don't buy it for regular tattoos
1,"Tagged as ""gifts for kids""!?","Are people absolutely insane? One of the tags on this item is ""gifts for kids"". Just what every kid needs, something that can permanent damage, spread disease, and infection. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE tattoos and have a few of them, but they were all done by PROFESSIONALS IN A CLEAN AND STERILE ENVIRONMENT. This should not have tags of ""gifts for kids"" or ""fun""! Tattooing is serious business."
1,Everything you need to scar and blind your friends!,"Just when you started to think it was safe to get tattooed, you realized that some nimrod was handing out tattoo kits to kids. What a great idea!!! Lets make equipment available to people that could potentialy be used to blind and mame, without so much as a disclaimer! I don't know who i feel worse for, the person who gets taken in by this ""kit""... or the people they try it on. :("
3,Not worth it,"I recently purchased these for a trip where I only used a carry on bag. When I arrived and unpacked, the bottles were dented. The sprayer works great, but there is only one sprayer. I had 2 bottles that needed a sprayer, so I had to constantly take it out of one and put it on the other. What a Pain! They're just OK ~ for the money, they're an actual rip-off. An empty trial sized hairspray bottle would be better, cheaper and plastic so it wouldn't dent. I wouldn't purchase these again."
2,"Um, are these used?","Personal hygiene items are best left personal. When I received these, there was some smudgy, oil brownish substance in the grooves of the caps and on the bottles. Pretty nasty. I threw them away. So whomever bought these, stored crude oil in them, and then returned them, I must have gotten yours."
5,Nothing short of Amazing!,"Ian Gillan's solo albums do not sound like Deep Purple. His solo albums range from blues, jazz, pub rock to metal. This is one of his heavier numbers. The title track is a great fast rocker, ""Night Ride Out Of Phoenix"" and ""Lucitania"" are more of the NWOBHM numbers. ""No Laughing In Heaven"" is a classic tale about going to heaven and finding out it is no fun! Hilarious. The Gillan albums from 1979 to 1982 are similar to his Black Sabbath ""Born Again"" album, so if you liked that, you will like this."
4,Brings back the memories.,"I thought I would sit back and listed to this album, but ended up calling all of my old friends from school! These songs queue some of the best moments of my life."
2,Bad Read; Not History,"If you are looking for a colonial history book, move on. This book has no maps, few dates and is told from the POV of individuals with little or inconsistent details or context from chapter to chapter. Occasionally the writing is good, more often the author seems to be enamored of his own attempts at being clever or cute. Repeatedly editorializes about what a historical figure would have thought or done. If you are very familiar with colonial history and can deal with the authors writing style you might enjoy this book. If you are serious about your history this is most certainly not the book for you."
4,Totally solid External DVD player,"This item shipped faster than Amazon expected. Was pleasantly surprised when there was a package waiting for me at my house.This DVD player plugs right into any USB 2.0 port and works right off the bat. The previous review said she didn't get the install CD, but also says she did not get the item described. So.....But I did get the correct item, and it does not require an install CD. Works really well. I can hear it slightly, but when not in use (like when I'm going to sleep), you can just turn it off.Definitely recommended."
3,Interesting music with some engineering flaws,"For those interested in the more serious works of Copland this Cd is recommended (or atleast the works on it.) The overall sound and performance is good, but there is an excess of bad, noticeable edits. I am sensitive to this being a musician, but I'm not usually disturbed by edits while casually listening to a recording. If you don't think all classical recordings (even ""live"" ones) are edited A TON, think again...this is no exception, and not very smoothly done."
5,Must read for ANYONE who has even heard the word anorexia.,"I finished the book and cried. It was so honest and detailed the struggles that this mother had to face, living with an anorexic daughter. Her ability to let go and turn away even though she desperately wanted to take her daughter in her arms and comfort her showed her strength and courage. She did what needed to be done in order to help her daughter and herself. Her ability to put down on paper the inner turmoil affecting the whole family and describe it in such emotional detail made powerful reading. Being the mother of an anorexic adolescent, I found the book very helpful and comforting. I use some of the things that Mary did in order to help myself and my daughter. I found help, support, honesty, comfort and helpful ideas for myself, other family members and for my daughter. Thank you Mary."
3,Writing from experience,"Being an aspiring writer myself, and currently recovering from anorexia, I immediately expected to be critical of this novel. I gained new insight on the chaos and pain I placed my family and loved ones through during my diagnosis, and have a new appreciation for everything that they, my mother in particular, have done for me. The story is passionately and appropriately told. It's difficult for the recovery anorexic to except, but it is also essential. I would recommend it for those suffering or recovering."
1,"Surtout, ne pas l'acheter!","Ce reportage n'a aucun sens, c'est scandaleux. Payer pour voir a, c'est une véritable arnaque! C'est très mal filmé et c'est vraiment pas un hommage rendu à ce très beau Parc National. Je décommande totalement l'achat de ce DVD."
4,"Handy guide, not great reading","This book provides an excellent guide to the Mississippi River, and I liked the list of supplies at the end as well as the daily lat/longs indicating his starting locations. The story itself is a quick read, not very deep, but more of a narrative of simple experiences that occurred on the trip.I would suggest the book for anybody preparing to canoe or kayak the Mississippi, but not for anybody looking to get a deeper meaning of life on the river."
4,a confirmed river rat,"A real life saga of one man's journey down the ""Mighty Mississippi"". A confirmed river rat, he brings to life the joys and dangers of his solo expedition. Byron did a great job in carrying you along with him every step of the way. I found my heart pounding, muscles aching, stomach cramping but also excited, awed and lifted in spirit. Definitely a must read and would make a great gift for the adventuresome spirit."
4,A Few More Dimensional Details Would Be Nice,"Overall a good reference book for makes, models, production numbers, etc. What is missing is a detailed description of barrel lengths and bore diameters, grooves to hold bayo lun in place, etc. This information is critical in that there are lots of fakes showing up on the market with cut down commercial barrels and faked markings."
5,Fantastic start to series!,"The Vampire's Seduction was a wonderful start to what is turning out yo be a great series. The main characters (William and Jack) are strong and well thought out. The supporting characters are also so well written that they stand on their own. This book leaves you wanting more if you are in to Vampires, Paranorml Romance, Sexy men and their women, with a nice touch of decent sex scenes."
3,"An ok start, to what will hopefully be a good series.","This book seemed to start out really slow for me. While I was enjoying the story itself, I just couldn't seem to get invested in the characters in the story, and the way it would switch from Williams point of view to Jack's seemed more of an annoyance. Luckily for me, about halfway through it really picked up. I really started enjoying the characters, the story grew interesting, and I was able to lose myself in the tale.Jack is a hilariously funny good-ole Georgian boy and he had me cracking up several times throughout this book. By the end I was on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen, and I loved the surprise ending. All in all, I'm excited to get to the next book. Several of my favorite series have started out with a slow first book and then exploded, and I have high hopes that this one will be the same. 3 stars"
5,Interesting Read,I liked the authors use of separate views within the same story. The cliffhanger of each chapter made these books (Im on number 4) easy to read and kept you going throughout the storyline. Keep up the good writing.
3,Good addition-- but PLEASE lose the name!,"I was looking around for a story that had some length to it so I took a flyer on this fairly new writer. I double-checked the price, because anyone who has so little respect for their audience as to put ""Raven Hart"" as the name of an horror novel writer just didn't give me much confidence. The novel has a good understanding of the typical vampire mythos and is deep in good supporting characters. The author chose to let each character write their own chapter which gives them center stage for their view of events. The struggle with that technique is the author is unable to give quality voice to so many characters and it slows down the tempo of the book significantly. Kinda fallls under the old writing rule--don't tell, show. SO if you have some time to ---kill--this is an OK addition to your vampire collection. It really is more of a horror novel than romance as many of the sensual scenes are handled in a confusing and clumsy fashion."
5,Great New Series!,"William Cuyler Thorne, a refined old world vampire relocated to Savannah, has made a good life for himself smuggling vampires to the new world away from their evil sires in Europe. Fury has sustained him through the centuries more than human blood. He flirts with his death by the hand of ""his Eleanor"", a mortal woman that understands his secret desires.Happy go lucky Jack McShane, the only vampire William has sired, works loyally at William's side. He's in the dark when it comes to his own power and the secrets William has kept hidden from him for years.Suddenly, vamps end up dying and as Jack would say ""all hell breaks loose.""This story has something for everyone, a healthy dose of vampiric humor, a touch of horror, shape-shifters, powerful voodo, sex and romance.A great read and I can't wait to find out what happens next in the series. This is not your typical paranormal romance and I'm so glad I picked up this book!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"It is rare that we GA gals get a series all to ourselves, especially a spicy vampire series, raven doesn absolutely amazing work and this book is NO exception! I think everyone should read this series atleast once!"
4,"Pangolins,orcas, sords","This book, with its somewhat brief index and appendices, has a good bibliography but repeats a habit of imprecision that seems, unfortunately, common to some older natural history books. For instance, the phrase ""At one time, peccaries were known to wander..."" will only cause you to reach for another book if you want to know WHEN the peccaries were wandering. Or ""Humans have kept domestic cattle for centuries...."" In about 20 years, one can add another century to that data and be no closer to any truth. But, if you aren't after strict facts, this can be an enjoyable book to peruse, anecdotal and no-nonsense. The color photo of a silverback gorilla is memorable."
1,Poor Inflation Valve,"The pillow is really easy to inflate, but on that same note, the air comes back out just as easily. It is difficult to put the valve stopper in before half the air you blew into the pillow comes out. There is not piece like those of beach balls or swimming floaters inside the valve that keeps the air from escaping while you try to plug it. Would not recommend the product unless you want an extremely soft pillow."
1,disgusting,pillows just bursting at the seams in several places after only 1.5 hours of use!pillows were not too inflated!
3,"Good book for the price, but no answer key","This book is meant to accompany a pre-algebra textbook referenced in the instructions on each page. If you buy this book, be prepared to give your student significant instruction before making assignments. In other words, this is not a math workbook for a self-directed student.There is no answer key either, so you'll be spending a lot of time solving problems yourself.The questions are clear and usually have enough space to complete the work right on the page.I bought this book for a summer workbook for a soon-to-be 5th grader who is doing advanced mathematics. For the price, the workbook is good, but there are probably workbooks that are easier on parents for summer work."
2,No answer key,"Excellent workbook and I have no doubt it will help tremendouslywith practice skills and really mastering the concepts.However, there are NO answers so unless you are an A ++math student this may not be a good book for you. I am trying to find theteachers guide with answers because I believe this is a good book.Algebra is my worst subject so I won't be using it with my son yet."
4,math book,great book for going over basic skills for pre-algebra. kids are difinetly ready for algebra one when they leave this class.
2,No answers in the back of the book,"I wish I would have read another review on this before I bought it. It is a workbook that is paired with a textbook. There are NO answers in the back of the workbook, which pretty much defeats the purpose of having a workbook if you cannot check to see if your answers are right so you know you are doing the problems correctly."
5,Follows the textbook well,Have not used it much as my son does well in class. Looks like it follows the book really well.
1,how to design jewelry,"The book was written in the ""seventies"" the ideas, tools styles and information is Quite outdated, antiquated even.I would NOT recommend this book!"
5,Fabulous girls,"Trinny and Susannah can be acid mouthed when it comes to getting a girl on the right track if she's gone a bit awry with the clothes and makeup. Having said that, their advice is timeless and always useful and a lot easier to stomach when the words can be read instead of listened to! I have pretty much all their books and heartily recommend them to anyone needing ideas when they feel their style needs a boost."
5,What a hoot!,"Having grown up in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, I find that this is one book that I can relate to very well (or ferry vell). This book really hits the nail on the head when in comes to the PA Dutch trying to speak a language that just must not be in their genes to speak. I never really thought about it before, but the way of talking described in these 96 pages is exactly what I have grown up listening to. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh about people who talk funny and don't know it."
2,Not very comfortable,"I have used these extensively...they are a simple, firm pad intended to offer minimal insulation and padding to soldiers sleeping in various circumstances. They are too thin and cheap to make for comfortable padding, even when sleeping on a completely flat and level surface. Not recommended."
2,Too small,"This is a Lemon/Lime Press. The Oranges in China must be real small, so if your planning on pressing Oranges make sure they are small and forget about Grapefruit."
4,rewind: best of the 80's,"ITS A 2 CD SET PLUS MUSIC VIDEO DVD OF 32 CLASSICS. THE 2 CD'S ARE WORTH 5 STARS. VERY EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY. I NEVER HEARD THE SONGS SOUND SO GOOD. I HAD TO GIVE IT 4 STARS. THE MUSIC VIDEOS WERE TRANSFERED FROM VHS TAPES. SOME ARE OLD WITH DOTS IN THE PICTURE. THE FIRST 2 VIDEOS HAD JUMPING AND TRACKING ADJUSTMENT. THE AUDIO WAS TERRABLE IN VIDEOS LIKE CLOUDBUSTING- KATE BUSH, NOTHING COMPARES 2 U-SINEAD O' CONNOR, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT ME-CULTURE CLUB AND VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO STAR-THE BUGGLES. ALL ARE FULL FRAME, EXCEPT 2 VIDEOS (WIDESCREEN)."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Back when I first bought this, my wife and I had just started watching these types of movies. Just imagine a lame rated R movie and add a little bit more/longer sex scenes. The nudity they show could almost be allowed in a rated R movie. This is basically super soft core. Some of the actors were very attractive, but not most of them...you get what you pay for. I gave this movie 2 stars because you get 2 movies."
3,not sure about the tone,"I'm hoping for a positive approach to Russian history that was sympathetic to the ideal of Orthodox autocracy and didn't exaggerate the faults or ignore the benefits, both material and spiritual, of tsarist Russia. Unfortunately, the tone of his book is bitter, adversarial, negative and paranoid. I don't believe you have to be a card-carrying conspiracy theorist to say good things about Holy Russia. I don't like the way he tries to justify the anti-Jewish pogroms, for example. It seems far better to point out how many Orthodox bishops actually condemned them (since the Church is so often accused of abetting the riots). There is nothing Orthodox about pogroms or any other kind of reckless violence. For anyone who wants a sympathetic portrayal of Old Russia, read Solzhenitsyn instead."
1,A waste of time and money. Written in poor taste.,"From the beginning, the author blasts Western Europe and the Americas and tries to set a tone of an all Holy Russia during the last 1,000 years - although, the author never really defines what he means. There is only a scant record of sources used throughout the book. As someone who has studied Russian history, I view this book as full of false assumptions and even propaganda. Of course, the book does contain a few true facts about Russian history, there are too many errors and misrepresentations to count. The book might appeal to one who is discontent with the U.S. form of government or to one who has no knowledge of Russian history. As a practicing Russian Orthodox, I would not recommend this book to anyone!"
2,Simply do not agree with this,"Russia has had some great leaders and defenders, BUT if Tzarist Russia was so wonderful, why did some peasants, aka ""liberated"" former serfs, want a revolution? Russia called itself communist, but it was totalitarian, in truth. The peasants did not get what they hoped for. Being a capitalist, and a proponent of true free trade, based in kindness and fairness (true Christian values), I don't support communist ideology, or monarchistic, I support democratic. Read ""Unfree Labor: American Slavery and Russian Serfdom."" I do not support the perspective of this book, but it is well written. Having been to Russia in 2001, I see hundred's of years of oppression still trying to play it's self out. I pray for healing in Russia every day."
3,Still...,Guys... You still haven't figured out that all religions are fake. Don't let small groups of people control you by religion.I'm sure this book is interesting but also sure that it is pointless.
3,Its as basic as it gets,Nothing exciting about this. Pretty basic. Bought for a trip to Europe where we were only taking carry ons and planning on doing laundry in the sink. Most of the hotel sinks had stoppers that worked well so I only used the stopper once and it still had a slow leak do to a small imperfection on the edge of the stopper. Still worked ok if you worked fast or held it down with one hand. The Woolite packets are ok. Still prefer the Tide packets we took along too.
3,Ok,"I've used this kit several times while traveling abroad. The plug is handy, especially in older hotels that have sinks without a sufficient stopper. My big problem is with the woolite packets. Nearly every time I travel with these, at least one breaks open and spills all over my stuff. Not a huge tragedy since it's soap, but a mess and a pain in the neck just the same. I started packing them in ziplock baggies, so that WHEN not IF one of them bursts, the mess is contained. The woolite does clean very nicely, though, and I can clean a few days of underthings and socks with one packet."
1,"Do not waste your money,make your own trave sized detergent","The packets are really small, and only out to wash two underwears in a sink...really. I get it : maybe those who buy this don't need clean clothes. But still, your should be able to wash 3-4 small things in a sink with one packet and this can't do that. Make your own....it's cheaper and you know what you have at your disposal."
4,Useful but don't expect to wash too many items for serving,"My fiancee and I were flying through Paris to head to Greece. We had heard of some horror stories of losing luggage and also we heard that Santorini was not condusive to large pieces of luggage. Therefore we made the decision to each just pack a carryon for our 10 days trip. I knew that I wouldn't have enough room to pack clothes but I thought I would try and wash some while on the road. This product worked as advertised in the sense that it foamed up and washed my clothes. Note that if you try to wash more than 2 items with any one package, you may be a little disappointed. I noticed that anything more than that and your clothes may not smell entirely clean. So this product is good but there are definitely a few limitations."
4,Picture says it all,"Having small packs for small, travel-sized loads is nice, and the rubber stopper means you can use a sink or tub of any size."
3,great,"This is a great album by Gillan, but guitarrist Jannick Gers should have stayed with him instead of going to plague Iron Maiden forever...!"
2,Frustrating,You can only use it in one direction because the tape used underneath the lint remover strips gets jammed if you try to go both directions.
1,Can you give zero stars?,"When you're rolliing, the roller slides off all the time.There's no cardboard in the inside of the refill so the adhesive sticks to the plastic and unrolls on the inside so you keep having to take it all apart. Rubbish. Can't believe 3M put their name on this junk! Not even sure if it's really made by them. Seems like more of a Chinese knock-off. Not worth the time to return this for such a small purchase. There weren't to many options for this [push] style of roller."
5,First Hand Account,"As an avid student of history and politics, I really enjoyed reading this author's analysis of US policy and learning about ethnic conflict and how it affects individuals and families.I now have a deeper understanding of the issues that the US is faced with around the world including the current situation in Iraq.What makes this book truly special is the author's ability to incorporate a first hand account of many events. Clearly this author can talk the talk and walk the walk.I strongly encourage anyone interested in a deeper understanding of the US Governments policy making engine and/or ethnic conflict and how it effects those caught in the crossfire to purchase this book."
2,Arrived damaged,"Pros: Sturdy metal base, joints feel nice and tight.Cons: Arrived loose in the manufacturers box. There was absolutely no padding or anything between the flimsy cardstock box and the item itself. It arrived partially disassembled in an opened plastic bag inside the manufacturers box. The magnifying glass was scratched (likely during shipping due to the loose metal parts banging against it) and had a fingerprint on it that I could not clean off with Windex.Resolution: Disappointment and a return to Amazon for a refund. Props to Amazon for having an easy and hassle free returns system."
4,Highly versatile and effective,"The only way to solder small connectors in an office environment away from a vise or workbench. The clips are are effective and fairly easy to adjust. It is helpful to have a clamp to fix the base to your working surface, The magnifier is crude but helpful for most soldering jobs. Great value for the money."
4,Heavy base but could be heavier locking system needs improvement,"Overall for the price of this unit there is not much to complain about. The major grip i have is the wing nuts to tighten or loosen the gator clips and glass could use improving. The base is heavy but i wouldn't mind if it was heavier. I took off one star b/c of the locking system used, it is a little cumbersome but overall it is a good product and im not sure why so many people bashed it. It is good for light work and for the price you can't expect much more. Mine was 100% assembled when i pulled it out the box so overall im happy with it."
3,Good for the price,"Assuming you're using this for small, lightweight uses, it's a good buy. I used it to hold up an arduino motor shield kit while I soldered it. Doesn't withstand too much downward pressure without tipping, but not much pressure was needed for this use.It would be nice with the wing nuts were better quality and if the base was heavier. Also, the magnifying glass is a bit inflexible. But for the money, and for what I needed it for, it was perfect."
4,great price,"it really helps on holding small things, but you have to get used to the magnifying glass"
2,Not the best tool..,This tool is pretty flunky. I would get something a bit more expensive and robust. Inclusion of the mag class is nice though.
1,Be prepared to have to buy a new one every year,"I bought two of these, and they worked great, but died after 6 months to a year of use. Do you notice you don't see any mention of a warranty in the product description? Now you know why. The price is way too high for something that won't last."
1,Short life span,"I bought two of these units. Both stopped working within one month of each other after approximately 7 months. Cheap to buy but very disapointing in life span. Since you would basically have to buy two per year to keep a working dehumidifier for a full 12 months, you might as well buy a better built unit up front. You will actually pay less in the long run. Unless you have time and money to burn, do not buy these units."
3,good for rv,"okay for rv use,quiet,and was happy with its operation!Great for summer use in rv,I was surprized as to how much moisture it removed...Not real powerful,but like I said...great for an rv or a large closet at home! would buy again."
1,Stopped working in one week,"The title of my review says it all - simply ceased working after 1 week. My guess is that, at this price, there is no quality control so you just roll the dice. Good luck!"
3,Eva-dry EDV-1100 Electric Petite Dehumidifier,"This is a very small machine--great for use in the bathroom. I have had this item for less than 1 month and the motor is already loud and does not run correctly. I will have to return this item but I am sure it is a quality manufacturing issue. If the machine continued to work I could live with the noise, except at night. At night it is toooooo loud to sleep because I can hear the motor running in my Master Bathroom that is connected to the Master Bedroom. Unfortunatly, since it is the motor that is failing I will have to return it.If you are looking for a machine to last I reccomend you purchase a more expensive unitThanks,tlgfda"
4,Liked it,"Very good product. However, I didn't realize how tiny it was. It's too small for my walk-in closet. I have to empty the receptacle every other day. I should have gotten a bigger unit."
4,Only Good For Small Spaces (EDV-1100),"I have the Eva-Dry Petite Dehumidifier(EDV-1100) in my small closet in the bedroom (5x5x8 ft) and it does exactly what it's supposed to. Since it's a small unit, it can only absorb a minimum amount of moisture in the air but it's sufficient for my closet in the mean time.I can leave it on at night with the closet door closed and I don't hear anything; in the day time when I'm not home, I leave it 'ON' with the closet door open for better air flow."
1,Garbage,"Good for a shoe box for a cuople months then it will get loud to the point it,s in the reycle dump now."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this dehumidifier because my small bathroom lacks enough ventilation to completely remove the moisture in it. I simply wanted a product that would help to dry out the air. Unfortunately, the Petite Dehumidifer fell short of my expectations. Not only was this device unable to remove any moisture from the air it also had me worried that it would burn down my house. The plug became extremely hot and the actual unit emitted an unusual plastic smell. Either I received a defective product or it simply isn't a good dehumidifer. I had no choice but to return it."
1,Absolutely Useless,I tried it at various locations including a well used full bath. Kept it plugged in all day ... wet towels on towel rack ... dripping shower door ... you get the picture. Would you believe it ... No water in the plastic container! None at all. It goes (hums) non-stop and does nothing. I don't know how people find this of any use at all. I also have regular (with compressor) Soleus dehumidifiers and they work great. Total loss of good money on this purchase. Rarely have I seen a product as non-functional. Moral: Eva Dry is all wet.
2,Died after 11 months,It was great while it worked... but it's too expensive an item to DIE after only 11 MONTHS.
1,Works great - but short life,"I purchased this for a bedroom as there is a problem with dampness. This item works very well but lasted 14 months. If it were $10 I wouldn't care, I would just go out and purchase another one. BUT I paid $39. and now it is over $50!! For this reason I cannot recommend it."
5,Good Item,I needed a dehumidifier for our bathroom as one of our female household members takes long hot showers. It works well and does what it is designed for. It should be used only in small places. The fan is not totally silent but is not noisy or distracting or annoying. What remains to be seen is the durability of the product.
4,A very nice little unit,I have used it in my bathroom to prevent a buildup of mildew in the shower. It was been work fine and I am very pleased. A great little product.
1,Stopped working,Kept it in a small bathroom. Unit worked great for about two months. It gradually lost its abililty to dehumidify until it finally stopped working. I used it for four months.
1,disappointing for many reasons,"Would I've only listened to the 1* ratings here...here what I don't like about the unit.1. power supplyWhy the hell do we need an external mini power supply adding another 4ft wires? Can't that be build in? I wouldn't even have a problem if it would come with a 1ft cord...2. whisper technologyExcuse me? My A/C unit is quieter that this! Maybe they meant it prevents whispering. Its definitely not quiet!3. why no power-off timerwhy cant they have a auto power off after 1,2,3 or so hours. I'm usually not at home for 10hrs after I took my shower... its probably going to burn down the house...well I give it a few days... and probably return it."
5,Big power in a small package!!,"I am a cake decorator in NC. Humidity is a big factor in the outcome of making and using rolled fondant (a rollable icing). I was looking for a dehumidifier to remove moisture from the air in my work room. Regular size products were expensive and bulky.And then I discovered the Eva-Dry EDV-1100!! It is fantastic!!I am constantly amazed at how much moisture is removed from my 11.5 x 13.5 room!!The product features include lights to indicate that the machine is working; a see-through water containment system; and an indicator light to let you know when the container is full. It is very easy to remove and empty the water container.Its petite size makes it possible to station the machine in the smallest of space....but it does a big job!!The Eva-Dry EDV-1100 does a great job, at a great price!!I absolutely recommend it!!I even use the collected water for watering plants!!"
2,"Only lasts a year before breaking! Otherwise, great...","I would give this little dehumidifier 5 stars because it's not too too loud, it's small and discreet and it does suck moisture out of the air like nobody's business. However, it simply does not last long enough to justify such a positive review. I bought two and they both died roughly one year later (after fairly continuous usage but still, a year is not very long!)Although it was a little hard to contact them, the company that manufactures them did replace one that died under the one year warranty (be sure to register it if you buy it -- that way you can at least get two years' worth of use out of it.) I really wish they were longer-lasting as that seems to be their one downside."
3,Worked for a while but died,"Purchased this item in fall 2007 for $40. It worked great when in use, but the motor burned out fall 2008. Not sure if it was a defect of the one I purchased or if it is a common problem. Now it's just another dead electronic that sits in my closet."
3,Unit Worked but only for a few months,"This little unit did well in a small coat closet. Where I store old camera stuff. Needed to empty the water out about every 5-6 days. Doesn't take out very much moisture, but was enough for my needs.Problem was that it only ran 24/7 for a 5-6 months then died. Took it apart and the power supply and fan were OK. Suspect something went wrong with the electronic chiller.Replaced unit with an Eva-dry Renewable Wireless Mini Dehumidifer that is placed inside the box of camera gear. Won't extract as much moisture, but since it is inside the storage box I think it will be OK."
3,good for small spaces,"Purchased this for the bathroom, which has poor ventilation and had begun to have a small problem with mold. Even during dry days the bathroom was humid, and the Eva-dry has aided us. Our mold problem has been alleviated. However, the small engine struggles at times to rid the room of the heaviest of the moisture. I run it only during showers or baths until the room is dry - which does take it some time. This dehumidifier is okay for small places only. It does take its own sweet time, but it gets the job done."
2,Doesn't Meet Expectations,The size of the the Dehumidifier is good. But it doesn't meet what we expected. It does not take much moisture out of the Air.
2,It did not do the job....,I purchased this item for the greenhouse because some of the wintered plants were getting mold on the leaves. The greenhouse is 560 cubic feet and has a 94% humidity at 46 degrees Fahrenheit . I ran the EVD-1100 for 96 hours straight and managed to remove 1 tablespoon of water and the humidity in the greenhouse went up to 96% during the test period. I'm sending it back.
2,Not worth the money in my opinion,Very small and didn't collect enough moisture. Ended up buying a larger dehumidifier. I don't think this little dehumidifier would even dry out a closet.
2,It tries but is small,"This unit does pull a little moisture out of the air, but won't dry a very large space. But is also works as a white noise machine if you just need a bit of moisture control. We bought a regular full-size dehumidifier for our RV and use it as an end table."
4,Good little unit.,"I bought this in December 2007 for my small (40 sq ft) office. All through the humid spring and summer in Houston it pulled water out of the air 24 hours a day. It doesn't have the biggest motor, but it was sufficient to keep the room comfortable and needed emptying every 4-5 days. In November 2008 -- 11 months into the 12-month warranty period, it went dead. A couple of phone calls later I had found Barbie, who had me send the unit back with proof of purchase. About a week later it reappeared with a handwritten note that the adapter was the problem. Too bad it broke but good customer service to fix the problem."
2,Very Petite,This unit is meant for a very small room. I have it in a small bathroom (maybe 15 sqft) to help dry out the towels and bathmat. It doesn't seem to make any difference at all.The unit works by chilling aluminum fins and collecting the condensation that drips off of them. It takes about three days of constant running to fill the tank with standing water right next to it.I recommend something larger than this to actually have an effect in the room.
3,Smaller than I realized.,"It seems to be working fine. I do not know what I was expecting. I guess I should of paid more attention to the measurements (If there were any). It does take moisture out of the air and I have been emptying it. Probably would work best in a very, very small room."
1,Doesn't work mold on bathroom ceiling still,"The item is small and quiet as advertised...but where it lacks in size, it also lacks in performance. Thought I would have been able to use this dehumidifier in my bathroom (5'x15') to rid moisture after showers, but it doesn't do much.Very disappointed."
3,It's quiet,"It doesn't do the job as well as I thought it would. My bathroom is very small and the condensation (from showering) just seems to lay in the air. Of course, it's really running down the walls. I have never emptied more that an inch of water from this tank. I expected (and wished) it did a better job. Obviously, it is doing something and it's quiet so that's why I continue to use it."
4,Seem to work good,We use this in one of our work vehicles as a lot of the seals leak and it keeps the moisture down. Super Quiet and gets the water out of the air.
2,A bit misleading,The Eva-dry is super quiet and small but not very effective in a small bathroom (as advertised).
2,Don't expect much from this unit,"The performance of this unit is so meager that I have a hard time giving it a thumbs up. I suppose if you have a very, very small area, and you don't mind the dehumidifying process taking a long time, then this is the unit for you. I'm simply trying to keep mold from growing in my shower by dehumidifying bathroom after I get out of shower. As long as a run a fan (with shower door open, and fan pointing in the shower) in addition to running this unit, then I can dry out the shower stall. Without the fan, it takes way to long. Therefore, the obvious question: maybe the fan alone would do the trick."
3,Neat little dehumidifier.,"Works fine, but it is small and it really only works well for small spaces."
4,Dehumidifier product,"The Eva-dry Humidifier was placed in our workroom that stores copier paper. Because we were experiencing continual jams in our copier, it was suggested to find something that would draw any moisture out of the room. I purchased this product with the hope it would take care of the problem; it has done just that. Who would have thought that such a small appliance would solve a big problem."
2,Not very effective,"Using this in a bathroom without an exhaust fan. Does pull some moisture from the air, but still enough moisture left to allow mildew growth on the walls. It is pretty quiet and easy to use and would work better in a space without such a high moisture content."
3,Neat for keeping outdoor enclosures dry,"Very nice little product for keeping outdoor storage location dryer. I only wish that it had a nipple on the drain cup so that I could attach a small drain hose to it. Emptying the cup every couple of days is chore. I'll drill a hole in the cup and attach a hose eventually). Quiet operation, no real sound emitted. Low wattage, doesn't really get warm. Good for small spaces."
4,Good For My needs - Recommended,"This ""Eva-dry Electric Petite"" dehumidifier was a good choice for use in our small guest bathroom that, unfortunately, is carpeted. I don't know why the former owners of our house put wall-to-wall carpet in a small bathroom with a shower or why we haven't pulled it up in the dozen or so years we have lived here, but it is a really bad idea since it really holds moisture. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Small Size; this really is counter-top size+ Quite; hardly noticeable when it is running+ Works; not overly fast, but very consistent+ Auto Shutoff; stops running when the removable reservoir is fullMisc -* The power adapter is a little long and did not fit where I wanted it go, but easily resolved using a short extension cordI really like the small size of this dehumidifier and it performs as expected, recommended!CFH"
1,Broke after 6 months,"Worked OK for my small closet for about 6 1/2 months, then died. Not worth mailing to the manufacturer to fix."
1,Life of the Unit is Only One Year,"As noted also in several reviews giving it about 2-3 stars, the unit stopped working after a year. Talk of designed obsolescence! Well, in this case, looking for another brand rather than a replacement."
2,bad power supply,We bought it for a damp closet. It's amazing to me how much moisture this little guy sucks up. I just hope it continues to work for a long time.Update 2/18/2010Power supply failed in less than a year. I'll be contacting customer service to get a new one as this is from other reviews here a very common issue.
1,Worked great for 4 months,"The unit arrived and was plugged into our 5th wheel trailer in early Nov. 2008. Worked like a charm. Noise was moderate, although it might be a wee too loud for sleeping areas. Then the magic escaped and it just plan died in early March. 4 Months at a cost of about $[...] is not cause for great satisfaction. I will not buy another as I dont feel like shelling out [...] bucks annually."
1,Only lasts about a year,"This is the second one I have bought.The first one lasted about a year and this one lasted 13 months. I use this in a small bathroom about 2 hrs a day.It does its job fairly well.If you don't mind buying one every year then this unit is fine,but I think they should last longer than that.I will not take anymore chances on these.They just aren`t durable.By the way I would regularly clean it with dust off."
1,Died after 16 months,"Used this to dehumidify a storage closet in my basement (4x10)that had a musty smell. I wanted to prevent mold & mildew from growing on the canned goods and homebrew I had stored there. I ran it continuously and it worked well when it worked,filling the reservoir after about two weeks. Then it died after 16 month, phone Eva-dry and they told me they only warranty items for 12 months -the required (in the US) consumer warranty. So now I'm out $45+shipping."
2,Good for a limited amount of time,"I have had this dehumidifier for 8 months. It worked well for quite a while, very quiet and seemed pull a lot of moisture from the air in a small, converted garage. However, about a month ago, after having it off overnight, I turned it on and it made a horrible noise. I opened it up to find a loose screw. It got tightened and closed up, at which point it was less noisy but didn't seem to be working. It happened again, but since it isn't working anyway, it does not seem to be worth it to try and fix again.Perhaps, as another reviewer mentioned, it should only be used in small rooms for a short amount of time."
5,Great for small spaces!,"This little humidifier is small, quiet and works great for small spaces, like storage areas in your basement. Sucks water out of the air and makes wet spaces smell better. Totally recommend it. Won't work for larger spaces."
4,It works,"I use it in my bathroom, which is not properly ventilated. It does draw moisture out of the air. I haven't had it long enough to know if it will help prevent further mold and mildew."
2,"small, but weak","After running it all day, it drew about a half cup of water from basement, about 1/4 cup from closet. Seems to be energy efficient, but not too effective."
3,too small,This one is too small for the bedroom.. i ended up sending it back for a larger one.Although it would be fine for a bath room or small area.
5,works very well,"I am very pleased with this product. There is no assembly. You just place it wherever you want it to go and plug it in. It really collects moisture well, and is easy to empty. I use it in my bathroom because mold and mildew collects on the walls. I still have to use my exhaust fan, however."
2,Worked pretty well until it died,"I was happy with my purchase until the Eva-Dry 1100 stopped working after six months. The fan and the light kept working, it just didn't take any water out of the air any more."
4,Constant use & working great,"Started using this mini-dehumidifier for our damp bathroom two weeks ago and its been operating non-stop with no problems. We've emptied the 2 cup reservoir several times, which leads me to believe we should have gotten a larger model but, so far, it's up to the task. As far as noise, I'd guess-timate is sounds less noisy than those ""quiet"" style exhaust fans seen at Home Depot or Lowes."
2,Worked great - til it stopped working in 3 months,"No instructions for what to do when motor started making awful noise. I would shut it off, and turn it back on hours later and it sounded fine. Then one day it just didn't turn back on.No help from manual."
4,Dehumidifier,"The unit works as described. Better quality than I anticipated. Downside is, we have it in a small bathroom to eliminate a mild case of mold and humidity build up on the tile floor after a shower. It does very well on eliminating the floor humidity but is small and really has to work hard at eliminating mold. Does NOT eliminate the moisture from the toilet tank so you will get some moisture build up on the tank. Overall a good value. Would recommend it for specific situations like we are experiencing."
1,"You are all smoking crack, these things are whorthless!!!!!","The biggest problem with the Eva-dry Electric Petite Dehumidifier is that it doesn't dehumidify. Sure it's small and cute, and is blue and white, just like water. And it has a little recycling symbol on the front to make you feel warm and fuzzy. Oh and it's so easy to empty, all you have to do is pull out the little water holder and pour it out. Not sure why they included it though cause you will never need to empty it cause IT DOESN'T WORK. This dehumidifier doesn't dehumidify. It's super quite, mostly because it's not really doing anything. And super compact, again because it does nothing. It sits in the corner, plugged into the wall, and sucks out maybe one cup of water per week. Pointless. We put it in our bathroom which gets really steamy, and it pulled out maybe 1/8th of a cup of water per day. Don't waste your money."
2,did not work,I bought this for my camper to rid the windows of moisture and it didn't help at all. I placed it right in front of one window and it worked a small amount. The description says it's perfect for campers. they lie
1,"Quite, reliable, works great! (Update) NOT ANYMORE","Keeps a medium closet dry and mold free. Needs too be emptied about every four days. Really quite, can barely hear it run. Great deal!Well, it took me a while to change my review. After a year of use, this unit broke. It started leaking and also stopped dehumidifying. I threw it out a couple of years ago. Too bad, it had a lot of potential."
1,AC/DC Connector runs VERY hot,"To be fair, the manufacturer does indicate that this should be used in a small, enclosed space. It is simply not effective in anything larger than, say, a closet. However, please be aware that the ac/dc connector runs very hot at the plug-in. VERY hot. Therefore, I would not be comfortable using this small electronic in a small, enclosed space where it can't be closely monitored. To be honest, it makes me too nervous to use where it would be most effective, so that's why the one-star. This, unfortunately, was a waste of money."
5,good little dehumidifier,"I live near the ocean and things in my closet get mildew. I have a long wall closet and ended up buying a second. One wasn't enough. So I put one on one end and the other on the other.They are quiet, they sound like a fan. And they pull water. I have to empty them about every 4 days. I would recommend them for very small spaces."
5,Just the ticket!,"I got the little eva-dry dehumidifier for a basement closet that smelled musty and within hours I could tell the difference. I have to empty it every other day or so, but what a difference it has made and doesn't take up alot of room! I've been running it for a month and it continues to improve my closet. It doesn't feel damp in my closet anymore. The smell is almost gone. I would buy it again."
1,gives out electronic ozone smell and is very inefficient.,I accidently burned out the first one by using the wrong cord...(w/o AC adapter) and out of fairness bought another one to try to use for a small bathroom. It worked very slowly if at all....no humidistat so it never turns off...but even if a very humid bathroom I never could get the tank to fill up as the smell eminating from the thing had a very ozone/electronic smell like one of those Ion generators that seems unhealthy...especially considering public health experts warning against ionization machines. It's advertized to be used in 'baby rooms'. NO WAY!maybe in a very small closet or a hole in the wall...but it couldn't even dehumify a 8 by 5 bathroom...not even close. So maybe it's meant only for a cupboard.
4,it works,"i dunno if Kentucky is so humid that this dehumidifier wont work, but i dunno. every hour, it puts about 1 oz of water in the tray, but i need something that works a lot faster. i think it's awsome for a small closet type deal, but for a bedroom....prolly better gettin somethin bigger and more powerful."
2,Died after 10 months.,"Worked ok but stopped working after about 10 months. Before it stopped, it started working very slowly. $50 is a lot to pay for only a year's functionality."
3,"Worked great, but only lasted 13 months","I got one of these in July, 2008 to help curtail mold in my tack room where I store my saddles and bridles. Mildew on leather can be a big problem and a huge pain to clean off and eradicate. The tack room has a window unit, but with our 90%+ humidity summers, the AC alone wasn't doing the trick.I got this and was very happy - my mold problem disappeared almost immediatley. I was not concerned about the noise level, since it was not used in a living area.My tack room is 10x12 and I had to empty the reservoir about every 2-3 days. It solved my problem beautifully, but I definitely expected it to last longer - and if it was going to die, couldn't it have died within the warranty period???"
3,Difficult to find replacement for power supply.,"Its application really is only for very small areas. (Bathroom, closet, etc.) In my case it was for a bathroom that has no ventilation. Performance wise, it is only okay. Stopping or retarding the growth of mildew with as low power consumption as possible was my aim.The biggest grief is replacing the power supply should it fail. Mine failed after nearly a year of almost continuous use. Had no luck trying to find a supplier for this particular power supply. Ended up finding another 9V, 3A power supply and did some wire splicing and soldering. So far it is holding up.Another thing to note is that these power supplies run extremely warm when the Eva-dry is running. It is best to make sure that the power supply is not buried under anything so as to prevent overheating."
2,not what I expected,"This item turned out to be much too small for my use.Also, it was delivered defective. I got it ready to trial and it wouldn't even turn on. It was returned for a full refund, which I'm still expecting."
1,Useless,"i kept it running for 6 hours in a very humid room (>80 humidity), after 6 hours it collected few drops of water. definitely not efficient."
2,Not impressed,"I live in a less than 600 square foot house... We placed this dehumidifier in a closed room of about 100 square feet.... and it felt like a tropical forest in there. Even though the room was so humid that the windows got fogged up, the dehumidifier took 2 days to fill up its 2 cup reservoir. Very inefficient, not effective.... pricey for a job poorly done."
4,dehumidifier,"Eva-dry EDV-1100 Electric Petite Dehumidifier (Purchased on 02/28/2008)by Eva-dry...or share an image.very good, very small and convenient (can keep it on my countertop)......would recommend it....................."
2,"Worked great for 8 months, then died","We put this dehumidifier in a small bathroom with no fan. It worked great for 8 months, then totally died. I thought maybe the fan seized which would be an easy fix. The fan was fine, so somthing was fundamentally broken. At that point I gave up and trashed it."
4,a very good machine,"works fine, but power is a little bit small.Take quite a time to dehumidify your house if you have a big one."
4,"Good, Small","I bought this for my small bathroom. It seems to work well, or at least makes me think it is doing a good job.I would just warn potential buyers that it is very small, and if you are trying to dehumidify anything larger than a closet I might spend a few more bucks.I bought it cuz its cheap and you know, I ... think its working.So yeah. Its great for small spaces, no disappointment there. But shell out some dough if you have it for a larger one for real results would be my final word."
3,Pretty Good Stuff,"I would like to say for such a tiny device, this product has made our house a little more bearable. We are originally from a very dry climate and this device has made it so that our house (mainly the basement) is a little more dry and easier to work with."
1,Does Not Dehumidifier,"Placed the Eva Dry Petite Dehumidifier in a small, closet-sized bathroom. The dehumidifier ran during and after the evening shower. After running all night there was no noticeable reduction in dampness. About three drops of water had condensed on the top of the collection tray; there was no water in the tray. After continuous running for a week it had collected about two tablespoons of water. Towels in the bathroom stayed damp.As a comparison, a large Zenith dehumidifier was run in the same space for about three hours each evening after showers. During that period over a gallon of water had been collected. Towels dried, mold growth was minimized.Since the Zenith worked, there was obviously moisture in the bathroom. Even if the Eva Dry didn't have the capacity to dehumidify the space, it should have been collecting moisture. The bathroom had lots of moisture. The device simply wasn't collecting water from the air. IT DOES NOT COLLECT MOISTURE FROM THE AIR."
4,Powerful little guy,"I got this for my bathroom. It has a window, but no fan and mold is a problem. This item arrived early, and it's very cute. It fits perfectly in the corner of my bathroom. It does not make much noise, but I still close the door at night because I am a light sleeper. I had lots of fun watching the water fill up in the little compartment. I was amazed to see it filled up in only 4 days! I guess that's how much moisture is in my bathroom. It's been almost a month now and it's still going strong. Glad I got this little guy."
2,"Worked for a year, then it died","Just after a year our unit died. Until then it worked, extracting a few ounces of water out of the air each day. Replaced with a much larger Soleus unit..."
2,It works...but not well.,"I have this in my bathroom and can tell you that it does work (water does collect in the reservoir), but it does not work well (while you will quickly see water begin to collect in the reservoir, it is a little misleading on how well it is actually doing, due to the fact that the bottom of the reservoir is tapered, so the first few drops of liquid are pushed front and center, leading you to believe that it is working quickly and efficiently). I have closed my bathroom door after a shower and allowed the evadry to go to work. Three hours later, it is still obviously much more humid in my bathroom than the rest of the house. I was hoping this would allow me to avoid having to have a bathroom exhaust fan installed, but it really turned out to be a waste of money."
4,Small but mighty,"We've had this unit for a month and use it in our master bath. For such a small machine, it does a wonderful job keeping the moisture down. With several hot showers per day, the mirrors are less steamy each day and mildew is greatly reduced. The unit is almost whisper soft; can barely tell the unit's on. We empty the unit about every 2 or 3 days. Great item."
5,Great for our motorhome,"I really like this dehumidifier and recommend it for motorhome owners or anyone with a small space that needs it, it's small and works very well. We use if during ski season to get rid of excess moisture in our motorhome."
4,'Lil dehumidifier that could!,"This is a great little dehunmidifire and we love the turn off feature.Its quiet and nonobtrusive.The only downside we've experience is when emtying the tray. Sometimes it won't register that we did and will stay off. After some checking and jiggling, she's back on again."
2,Much ado about nothing,"The dehumidifier is a great size, makes relatively little noise, and even gives off cooled air. The only downside? It doesn't really dehumidify. I used this product in my 5x8 bathroom for a few weeks, and it made no discernible difference in the bathroom's humidity level. I've used regular-sized dehumidifiers in the bathroom before, and they would fill up with water within a day; this product would take a week despite being 10x smaller. My mirror still fogged up, and my towels still stayed damp."
1,Works well when it works,"NOT worth $60. I bought two and the orginal is still working like a charm. But, I've already sent the second unit back twice for full replacements - they keep failing (fan problem). It costs me over $13 to ship it from PA to FL - so I have about $30 in shipping fees in addition to the original $60 investment. They do work great - but they are made so cheaply in China that they just don't last long. My advice... junk - invest in something else."
1,"Worked great for a year, then died!",It is being used in a small basement room. After two weeks of use the humidity is down from 59% to 44%. Now the unit is dead and humidity is back up.
2,Only last about a year.,"We bought 2 of these because they work great, at first. But the 1 only lasted a little over a year, and the other didn't even last that long. It has something to do with the switching power adapters that the dehumidifiers come with, and need, to function. Nobody seems to know how to replace the switching power adapters. So basically you are out of luck once the power cords go, despite the fact that the dehumidifier is still capable to working."
2,bad quality,"After I saw those amazing reviews of this product, I was really excited to own this product. However, after I got this petite dehumidifier, I was really disappointed by its bad quality. It's leaking from the bottom to outside. It made my closet more humid than before. Also, it's only appropriate for very small and not so humid place. It's not working for reducing the humidity level of the space."
1,Worthless,"This thing is tiny, much smaller than it looks. It holds about a glass full of water before you have to empty it. I sent it back for refund."
5,Works Well for My Situation,"Works well in a small bathroom. The water collection cup easily removes. Has to be emptied about every two to three days.Plug it in, turn it on, and let her go."
1,DEAD after 11 months of use,"The petite model is fine for a two car garage in Florida. It's as effective as damprid, but without the need for continuous replacement.EDIT: this product died after less than one year of use."
2,Removes water very slowly and requires manual emptying.,"I bought two of these in hopes of drying out the tiny kitchen (little more than a closet) in our vacation cabin. Unfortunately our kitchen was rather drafty. The Eva-Dry was quite slow - in a day and a half of operation at about 58 degrees F in 60% room humidity, it removed less than two cups of water from the air. This didn't change the humidity of our drafty damp kitchen a bit, so I returned the units to Amazon (that part was great). My recommendation: The EVA dry works but slowly, so it is of no use to dry a room, even a tiny one, if there is any draft. It would probably keep an equipment cabinet dry.The other problem: there is no drain plug by which it could drain into a sink. The tank has to be dumped manually, or it just stops running when the little tank is full."
4,small but working hard,"This is my second item. I keep it on during winter/rainy season. It lasts about 2 ~3 years and break. It does OK job for such a small body. I keep it under the bed. I wish it's a big stronger, but this is better than nothing."
1,don't buy this product,"i saw the reviews, and i trust the review and buy the product. however, this is the worst product i never have before. i turned it on and ran over 24 hours in the first day when i got. only one drop in the container. finally, i have to ship the product back, and i need to cover the shipping by myself $11. this is mean i pay $11 for nothing but a lot of time.don't buy this product."
2,Not Enough,"I have a relatively small bathroom that was built without a vent. I live in a relatively cold area that requires me to take relatively hot showers. As such, I found myself with moisture on my walls, which lead to some mold.I did some research and decided to try this out, and it has not helped much.I must start by saying the thing really is quiet. I am at the end of the hall now from the bathroom and I could not tell you if it is on or off. Seriously.Now the bad. This thing is so small and weak that it does not seem to be doing much for my problem. I have it on the back of the toilet and when I come out, the mirror directly above the unit is fog free in about a five inch radius. The rest of the mirror is foggy and the walls are still damp to the touch. The thing is simply not strong enough for my purpose, which is too bad because it is small and silent and would have been perfect."
1,Awful,The only reason I gave it one star was because when it worked did well getting the humidity out of the bathroom. Do not waste your time this broke down after a week. The size is great but that's it.
2,Not work for small bathroom,I bought this dehumidifier because the are some good reviews for it on using with small bathroom. I tried it once and it collected nothing. The mirror is covered with full of water steam. My bathroom is very small.
2,"Quiet, but Inefficient","I was looking for a cheap dehumidifier for my small bathroom since there is not a ventilation fan. Contrary to other reviews, mine does not pick up much water (even during a shower). For the past 4 or 5 days now the water level has remained about the same, although it is extremely quiet. I wonder if the manufacturer made some design changes that made the dehumidifier quiet (because of people complaining of the loud noise in previous reviews), but less efficient. The reason I mention this is because on the box, in fine print it says:""Design and specifications are subject to change for improvement without prior notice."""
1,Yellow light first time turned ON,"This was a total waste of my time. I bought it because I thought it would be easier than replacing Damp Rid in my bathroom every two weeks or so. I plugged it in, turned it on ....and the Yellow Full light came on. I looked at the Eva dry website then called Eva dry to ask what I was doing wrong. A man told me to take out the container and put it back in again. When I still got a yellow light he told me to return it and came me a address. I asked for a Return Authorazition number and he said they didn't have those. I decided to return to Amazon for a refund... I didn't mind a one year on average lifespan but sending out units that don't work is ridiculous. I'll just keep using Damp Rid...it gets the job done. Now I've got to take the box to the post office."
1,"Worked ok, but broke","I purchased this dehumidifier about a year and a half ago because my apartment bathroom did not come with a fan. It worked fairly well until about four months ago. Last summer I emptied the bucket every other day. This summer, it ran the same amount of time, but the bucket never got full enough for me to empty. You can still hear something working inside the unit, but you don't feel any air coming out of it. Now I'm back on amazon trying to find another bathroom dehumidifier.By the way, this product doesn't clear the air in a small bathroom like an installed bathroom fan would. The dehumidifier is not powerful enough. The mirror is still very foggy when you get out of the shower, and it did not fix my mold problem (even when the machine was functioning properly)."
3,worked great - died early,"this little guy, worked great in my small house. It only lasted 1-1/2 years. I love the size. Very quiet. Easy to empty. Long cord, so I could move it around. I had it in the center of the house, in the corner of the hall. Very disappointed about it dying so soon."
3,"Great, for ONE YEAR","It worked like a charm in my windowless bathroom. Then, almost one year to the date, it died. Ugh. Is there an alternative out there? I need a good mini dehumidifier since my bathroom has no windows and a ceiling fan without exhaust. Putting up 50 dollars a year on a good dehumidifier is not ideal. I just ordered a new one, since I rather have one, then not. But, has anyone one found another quality and durable mini dehumidifier?!"
5,Great litttle machine & wonderful company to deal with,I purchased the Eva-dry small dehumidifier for a closet and it works great and has solved the problem I had with dampness. Fast delivery .There was a problem with the electricial cord which had nothing to do with the company.I called them they couldnt have been nicer and promptly send a replacement. I would recommend this unit to anyone who has a dampness problem in a smaller area. And again this company has a great customer service dept so refreshing in todays market place. Eve Lewes De.
3,Great While It Lasted,"This humidifier worked great in our RV. I would empty it every 5 or 6 days, and it really kept the RV from getting musty smelling. Unfortunately, the unit conked out one month after the warranty expired. I would have expected it to last longer."
2,For tiny closets only...,Tried it in a mid-size room but humidity has been steady at 70% for over a day and tank takes 5 days to fill because so little water is pulled from the air. Sending back to buy something that works.
4,"Good, but a little loud","I purchased this for my bedroom upstairs because I've noticed it gets really musty and humid inside (I live in Florida, so it's to be expected). Within just a few hours there was already quite a bit of water in the tank, so I was pretty impressed. I tried leaving it on to run all night, but it is way to loud for me. Might not bother some people though. It just sounds like one of those portable fans running on high. So, it's not like horribly annoying or anything because I do know people that love to sleep with those noisy fans running all night. Anyway, I've had it running during the day for the past 3 days and it is still picking up a lot of water and I've noticed my bedroom isn't as damp anymore. Hooray! I'd definitely recommend and I might even buy a second for my guest room upstairs. I just wish it was a little bit quieter so I could use it at night."
1,Stopped working after 6 weeks,"This worked great for the first 6 weeks, then it just stopped pulling out any moisture from the air. I tried to contact the Eva-Dry support and received a postmaster error. I wouldn't recommend this item."
2,Disllike - we're returning it. :(,We had it in a small bedroom and it didn't pull out any water in a room with over 50% humidity until after it was unplugged.
3,Good while it lasts,"This is my second 1 of these. The first lasted for about 8 months & then just quit on me. The company did take the product back & fix it, however, they would not pay for the shipping to return the product which I consider unreasonable as a product should be expected to work for at least a year ($10 for a product that costs $40). When it is working, it's great. I've now got it on a timer so that it's not on all the time - hoping that will help it last longer. Only time will tell."
4,EDV-110 review,"I have had this little unit for a year now and it really does remove moisture. It's farley quiet and can not sleep well at night without something running in my room. The only thing that keeps it from getting all 5 stars is that the humidity will not go down any lower than 60 per cent. I would like to get it more like 50 per cent. Maybe I need a bigger unit that removes more pints of water. Over all its a very well made and runs smooth. I like that has a DC brushless fan. They are tough, long lasting fans that usually never fail. I also like the size. I had a big heavy one that was overkill for my room. I hope you keep making good quality products. I strongly recommend this unit."
5,Gotta tell you!,"I play guitar, I own two. One happens to be an expensive Taylor ""400 series"". That guitar has to be kept in an area where the humidity is between 47-55%. I happen to live in Puerto Rico, where high humidity is a norm. My bedroom temp. is maintained between 64-67 degrees constant. However, the humidity level was always between 70-85% much too high. I unwrapped my Eva-dry Petite, placed it on my dresser, plugged it in and walked out and closed the door to the room...At the moment the humidity level was 79%. A few hours later (41/2-5hours) I checked in to see how the little puppy was doing. The tank contained approx. and inch and a half of water, and the humidity level was down to 74%. I was delighted! Can't wait to see the reading in the morning. By morning, based on this I expect to find a reading of 65% humidity, and it should all be downhill from there. I think this will be money well spent. You can register it on line for a one year warranty."
2,Won't last,I bought 2 of them for a bachelor suite and they did okay. I guess they are meant for under the sink. The problem is both failed after a year. I will not buy this again.
3,hmmm,"Does what it says it will do. Keeps a 3x8x8 closet dry. Requires emptying every 4 days in my home environment. Sure would be better if there were some solution for that, like a bigger tank."
1,Works great -- until it doesn't...,"I thought this item was incredible, until two units in a row died just out of warranty. One day they work, and then they just don't -- still get power, but the heat sink doesn't cool and the fan no longer runs. I feel a little cheated since these aren't cheap, and they manage to fail when I have no recourse. I'm disappointed since I have to find another solution for my small laundry room."
2,Maybe 1 cup per week,"This machine fits fine in our small bathroom, but it doesn't take much water out of the air. It just doesn't have the condensing capabilities to do it. If you need cute, quiet and don't care if a lot of water is removed, this is the device for you.It was rather expensive for the work it does."
2,Not very efective,"I set this on a very wet carpet, directly on the carpet. After about 4 hours, nothing. After bout 8, a very small amount of water. The positive is you can barely her it run. I am guessing it doesn't draw too much power, however, the amount of time it would take to actually dry out an area would equal out to just using a much higher powered unit for a much shorter time. I really am not sure how this could be used effectively, I do not recommend this product one bit."
4,did not work at first,"When I first plugged this product in, the fan was terribly loud. I knew that wasn't the sound it's supposed to make. Fan inside misaligned somehow. Important to note the fan is not held down by screws but rather notches. So if you drop this unit it might dislodge the fan and make it terribly loud.Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to take screwdriver and re-adjust the fan."
2,Not worth the $,"Does it dehumidify? Yes, maybe a little in a small space. Not really enough to make much a difference though. I'd say maybe like a 1/2 cup per day max on very humid areas.It also is not durable enough for continuous use. Ours broke very quickly. So if you want to occasionally put it in your car to dehumidify it, fine. But if you want to run it constantly in say a bathroom, it's really not suited for it."
3,"Works well, but only lasted a year","Like other reviews, this lasted about a year for us, then just quit working. While it was working, it did a good job at keeping the humidity down in our windowless bathroom and made a noticeable difference, while not taking up much space."
4,"Works great for small bathroom, power supply is an issue","In our bathroom mold builds up on the ceiling, so I bought this dehumidifier. It worked great, mold nearly stopped and the mirror cleared up almost immediately after a hot shower. I plugged it in and it basically stayed on for 14 months, then died (two months after the warranty ran out). It still works mechanically as the internal components are very basic (the only moving part is a small fan). The problem, as is probably so with most others that just stopped working, is the power supply. You can purchase it from Eva-Dry for $25 shipping included, which wouldn't make sense based on the original purchase price, or for under five dollars online, however the minimum order is 1,000 units. Quite absurd for one person. Hint, hint. Someone a little business savvy with a small nest egg could start something here. Until then, I have a perfectly good dehumidifier with no power. Planning on buying a new one."
2,Beware No free shipping,"I read some of the reviews about the eva-dry and thought it might be good enough for me. When i got the product i turn it on and decided it was too weak for a bathroom. So i returned it only to find out that since i returned it, it doesn't qualify for the free shipping. Therefore, I had to pay shipping for returning the product and sending the product. Had i know this earlier i probably would look for this item in a store near by. Certainly not worth the difference. This refund is for the following item(s):Item: Eva-dry Electric Petite DehumidifierQuantity: 1ASIN: B000H0ZDD2Reason for refund: Customer returnHere's a the breakdown of your refund for this item:Item Refund: $46.50Shipping Refund: $6.79Shipping Promotion Deduction*: ($6.79)Return Shipping Fee Refund Deduction: ($6.79)"
3,Works great for a while,"I have gone through 2 of these in the past two years. They seem to work great for about 16 months or so and then it just dies. My second one has just died after around 12-16 months. When it was working it did work great, however was a little bit loud."
4,I like this little guy!,"We bought this little dehumidifier for our kitchen. We have bigger ones in the basement but we just wanted something small and quiet for the kitchen. Well, it IS small and quiet. It only sucks out about a pint of water every 5-6 days but the humidity level in the kitchen feels much better than before. It fits nicely in the corner and isn't ugly at all. Emptying it is easy as can be. Maybe it would be better if it sucked more water out of the air... but it's good enough for our purposes!"
4,Uses for Eva-Dry,"We bought one of these for work and use it in an air-conditioned room where our paper is stored. In spite of the air-conditioning it still removes a reservoir and a half of humity/week! So I bought one for our home bathroom and it works well if the door and window are kept closed (which makes sense considering the compact size). Nice, lightweight little dehumidifier!"
3,"eva-dry, but hot!","Just purchased this little champ. We placed it in 7'x7' closet off the attic. This is older house and not well-insulated. The unit is doing a great job collecting water. However, when I went to move it the back of my finger brushed against the power adapter box on the electrical cord and I did get a little burn. So maybe it is working a little too hard!"
1,Zero Change,"I don't think much of this item. I used it in a very small, enclosed area and the humidity did not drop. It would work just as well were I to throw it off the second story balcony. Save your money, buy a better quality dehumidifier. I got what I paid for in this case. Thumbs down."
1,doesn't work at all,"After 24 hours, this machine had taken out about a teaspoon of water, whereas the Frigidaire 30 pint we replaced it with took out 15 pints in less than that amount of time.Yes, it's quiet as a mouse--because it doesn't work!Thank you to Amazon for making it so easy to purchase a better product after returning this one."
2,Not Happy,"I have a small bathroom and this unit picks up little to no moisture after a shower. Everything in the room is wet and after 2 to 3 hours, I'm lucky to have any water in the the holder."
3,Probably should've gotten a bigger one...,I'm using this in my bathroom because my fan no longer works and it does an ok job but for the money it probably would've been worth it to buy the next size up. It does work but I have to leave it on too long to totally dry the room out after a shower - maybe more suited for a half bath...
2,Inferior Quality,I purchased this product in August and it stopped working the end of November. Barely lasted 3 months. It did a fabulous job while it worked.
1,Do not last,"I was very happy for 5 days with the device. Than the collected in it water started to dry. The fan is still working, and the metal condenser is bit cooler than the room temperature, but not enough to condense the vapors. My guess is that the working agent inside it, whatever it is, is gone."
2,Stopped working after a year,"This dehumidifier is really ""petite."" I didn't check its dimensions before I purchased it. Never purchase it if you intend to use for a room. It's probably ideal for bathrooms or so.I used this device for about a year. It stopped working after 12 months non-stop working. I always kept it on. I don't know if it is normal for a dehumidifier this size, but I am not happy about it. Now, I have to shop again.The second star goes to non-stop and quite a job done."
1,Useless for my needs.,"I put this unit in my bathroom and hoped that it would do something. After 24 hours there was only a few drops in the tiny bucket. Perhaps in really high humidity situations, this will help, but I cannot confirm this. I bit the bullet and bought the Frigidair and am totally happy.Amazon was great about returning this unit, but I'm still waiting for it to be credited back to my account.I rated this with 1 star because there was nothing lower."
4,Leak problem but good customer service,"When I purchased this, I did not register the warranty card but when it started to leak I called the customer service and they were willing to take a look. So I shipped it and still they are testing there. They said it looks o.k. there. I might've not push the water tank tight or they behave somehow differently at my home. It was leaking so I had to put it on plastic container. It worked very well for my small walk-in closet which is connected to the bathroom where lot of moisture is. I will update how it wil turn out."
1,Only good for VERY small areas,Only buy this for your closet or small enclosure. Pointless otherwise.
4,"Splendid but not a ""tour-de-force""","Elis Regina's show at the 1979 Montreux Jazz Festival was full of polemics. First of all, she did not like her presentation. Second of all, there was a polemics with the great pianist Hermeto Pascoal who would have tried to show off. This CD shows all music which was recorded at the Festival what Elis Regina did not authorize at that time. This CD is a re-issue of a before released album (1982) but with 7 bonus tracks, simply those tracks Elis had not authorized in the 1982 issue. Cesar Camargo Mariano is brilliant as ever. Hermeto Pascoal plays on 3 piano-voice tracks with Elis, on ""Corcovado"", ""Garota de Ipanema"", and ""Asa Branca"". Despite all gossip, her renditions with Pascoal are great."
3,mild taste,"this was not the snickerdoodle flavored coffee I was looking for altho they advertise it as having that ""cookie taste"". Can't remember the brand of coffee I used to buy with this flavor, but it was titled ""snickerdoodle"" and was available already ground - this does not offer the option of ground coffee, -had to buy a grinder -They did replace the regular coffee first sent as I thought I was orderin decaf - they did do that promptly and without charge -"
3,Are You Loathsome............,"As a long standing PZB fan, I was thrilled to see another trade paperback on the store shelves. Although I loved every page of the book, I felt that it paled in comparison to her previous works. The stories seemed less vivid and much more obscure...and I had seen most of them elsewhere. However, the dominant voice was pure Poppy. If you're a PZB fan, ""Are You Loathsome Tonight"" is a must read. If you're uinfimilar with her works, start with something else."
4,Another Hit for Poppy,"Poppy Z.Brite creates another masterpiece, as she takes herreaders back into the dark and tricky essence of a world few canventure... ""Do You Feel Loathsome Tonight"" will most likely be compared to her past stories (i.e. Lost Souls, Wormwood, ect.) and some might look down on it as not as great as her past work, but the author has become the reigning queen of ABYSS horror fiction. In this new story she brings you back into the strange stage that is her mind and will either confuse you or put you in a stage of euthoria. Not as good as ""Drawing Blood"" or ""Esquisite Corpse"" but a must have none the less. END"
4,"Good, could be much better","This is one of the best CDs ive heard in a while. Only for musicality, however. The lyrics are a bit repetitive and have much meaning, beyond the surface, anyway. If you are looking for a CD loaded with great songs, this is it. If you are the type to judge music based solely based on lyrics, I suggest listening to a few songs first, you may still enjoy it."
5,Ace,"Following on from the bouncy 'How Ace Are Buildings' this record shows the revival of the British music scene. I have seen them about six times and met the band personally, and what a laugh they are! Just to hear Jason say Ace made my day. But with the bonus tracks, this makes this CD perfect for those great summer days. Buy it , listen to it, bounce to it. Buy their new album (Hi-Fi Serious) out this summer, and have fun. ACE!"
4,Bosch Icon 441,"I've only had these for about a month or so, but they are equal or better than OEM. I originally bought these because dealer price for a Pontiac G6 replacement wiper blades were $75! So I was happy to pick these up for about half the price. The only reason I don't give these a 5 star rating is because everything is great when it's essentially brand new."
4,"Just When You Thought You'd ""Heard it All""...","This is an amazing recording, filled with emotion and virtuosity. Don't let the young age of the pianist put you off, nor be overly concerned with technical nit-picking. Just listen.For many years, my own favorite modern pianist has been Alfred Brendel, but you must hear what Kissin is able to achieve.This recording continues to fill me with awe and optimism... for the subtle beauty created by Schumann and Liszt, and for the miracle of talent embodied by Kissin."
4,Unbelievable Playing But...,"My first exposure to the Transcendental Etude #10 was with Andre Watts as recorded on his Liszt album. I also own Claudio Arrau's full recording of all the Etudes. Both Arrau and Kissin, (and most others,) blow through this piece at astounding speed. Yet Watts on the other hand slows it down and lets the listener feel and hear every single note. The melody when played slower has a totally different effect on the listener and I find that it is more emotional than just agitating, which is how I believe Liszt said it should be played. Sorry Evgeny, as great a pianist as you are, I'll take Andre's version first."
4,Weston: music from the soundtrack Matinee,"Pennsylvania's Weston deliver a superb indie rock effort with 'Matinee.' From the opening note of ""Opening Chord"" to the unique fade-out of ""Radio,"" Weston ruminate on indie rock, girls, indie rock, and, well....girls. If pressed for a specific style I suppose ""power-pop"" would work. The songs are melodic yet they still rock. 'Matinee' showcases Weston's chief strength: their vocal harmonies. The melancholic ""Uninspiring"" and ""Lonely When I'm With You"" are a welcome contrast to more upbeat numbers like ""Record Shop"" and ""Next To You At Night."" ""Indie Rock Star"" is definitive Weston: clever lyrics, melodic guitars, strong vocals, and a catchy chorus that will bounce around inside your head for hours. A great song from a great album."
2,don't buy this item,let me tell you why i didn't buy this item.These dolls come with hard booties and their onezies can not be taken off. These dolls are best for really small children because they have no small parts.
4,Anytime Tools 5 Lathe Mill CENTER DRILL COUNTERSINK Bit Tooling SET,"A 5 Tools This is a very excellent center for lathes, drilling or metal HSS uses advise customers to purchase"
2,Revised my review,"Previous review...""Work good for mild steel and softer. Overheat on harder metals as expected. Great for the price on proper material.""After using these bits for a few months to drill lathe center holes, I have to revise my 4-star rating. When drilling mild steel I have had the tips snap off (even the largest size) with only light pressure on my tail stock screw. They seem to be very brittle. After the first one broke I was very careful to set my rpm, but then had another one snap. Bought some Keo replacements at my local tooling supply shop and have had no problems since.For precision pilot drilling for drills in my mill, I long ago switched to using spotting drills. Check this out on any of the machinist forums.These center drills do work fine for aluminum and other soft materials."
4,Anytime Tools Countersink Bits,"Just tried it today, used it to countersink a trim screw on a wooden base. Worked perfectly for my use and flush. This may not be for everyone, but for the different type screws I use it serves my purpose for initial countersinking."
2,what size,"probable a good product ..it would be nice if they put the diameter of the shank in the description .. 1,2,3,4,5,means nothing to me .. 1/64 to 5/16 tells me what size it is"
4,revolutionary ground-could we go farther?,"this book is noteworthy, as others have sugested, in large part becuase of its willingness to touch topics that are normally not considered worthy, especially in a strictly catholic latin american country. i highly recommend reading this book for entertainment purposes and to view new perspectives. however, also let the book make you question it. i wondered why puig decided to make his two ""outcasts"" fall so readily into predictable patterns. why does molina embrace so wholeheartedly what society tells him a ""woman"" must be like? the question and situation are both valid; let us simply take the book as that type of good literature which goes farther by forcing the reader to engage himself."
5,Entertainning to the last page!,"This book is Puig's best book that he wrote. The book is entertannig and hard to put down once you start to read the first story that Molina narrates to Valentin in the prison cell. The book has a mix of drama, mystery, horror, tragedy and good old fashion dialog. I assure you that you'll read this book in less than a week because is so entertainning. Great piece of literature. Won't bore you at all."
4,kiss of the spider woman,a good read if you're interested on how to use dialogue to convey action/emotion
1,hometown killer,"I've read true crime books for almost 40 years. This ranks as the worst. Recently I've noticed ""lazy writing"" in this genre, i.e., inserting pages and pages of court transcripts. We don't want to read them. It's your job to break them down for the reader. This author goes one step further; page after page of detective interviews. She doesn't even bother to summarize these interviews. I'm still laughing at Rothgeb's ""Author's Note"". If she has read dozens of true crime books over the years she certainly didn't learn anything. As for ""writing"" a book, please stop trying now and take some lessons from Ann Rule. This lady knows how to write a true crime book and so does M. William Phelps and Gregg Olsen. I can't wait to donate this to the library. Even those this book deserves it I could never destroy a book, as bad as this one is."
1,"Very disappointing--Trial transcript disguised as a ""book""","I have been an avid true crime reader for years, and never have I found a book any more disappointing than this one. It truly is almost as if the author retyped the trial transcripts word-for-word and renamed as a ""book."" I got no real insight into any of the characters, which is the most important part of what makes a true crime account so fascinating. There was also a lot of skipping around, with a less than smooth effort to present the sequence of events in a manner the reader can follow easily. Hopefully, this was a ""first book"" for this author, and future efforts will improve. Otherwise, I think I will stick with known authors in the genre that I can count on to deliver."
2,waste of money,I can tell that this is a first novel by this woman. She has no idea how to write a true crime book. There is no information about any of the people involved in this crime.She just copy the police questions to the killer. Waste of money. don't bother buying this book
1,Could Be Better,"This author didn't make much of a story out of the information she had. She might have done better if she created some interest. Mainly she copied the police interviews, and court information. I would like to see someone else try their hand at this subject. It is a story worth telling, with more feeling."
4,History but not a lot of the songs,This book was a great history of the troubadors. My only reason for giving it a 4 is that I had wanted to read more of the actual poetry and songs that they wrote.
3,Scanner Kit Arrived Without the Brush,"I thought the price for the three items was awfully good. Turns out, it arrived without the anti-static brush. I like the cloth and the fluid cleaner, but had to order a brush separately. If it truly does NOT come with the brush, they should remove it from the photograph."
1,Did this guy really know Ritchie Blackmore ?,"absolument consternant ...Try to find the ""Child in Time"" album, you'll there be surprised. Really."
5,Fascinating--definitely recommended,"This is a wonderful book; it is comprehensively researched and offers a detailed history of why US downtowns developed and declined. Anybody who is interested in urban planning and downtown revitalization should read this to see why downtowns were successful for so many years and why they fell; for example, a current trend is to revitalize downtowns by attracting more residents, but 19th century downtowns developed by pushing out residents in favor of commercial growth. I couldn't put this book down; it's absolutely compelling and I would highly recommend it."
2,"Okay for reviewing, but tests are not like the NREMT test.","You may find like I did that you did very well on the book tests (a couple of them I only missed 1 out of 150). Don't expect to ace the real thing. I passed on my first try, but I certainly did not ace it.Anyone who has experienced EMT State tests knows that the questions are much more complex than these practice tests. You find questions that will not have the answer you were taught in your class rather the next best answer.I even had a paramedic tell me that the EMT test is worse than the paramedic test because it's your first experience at these types of tests."
4,Good Assistance with National Registry Test,"As a teaching professional I know that the more questions that a student sees the better. Although the vast majority of the questions in this book were different to the type of question found on the National Exam, it was very helpful. I would certainly recommend this book as an aid to your classroom instruction, theoretical workbook and your ambulance practical time. In my opinion, there is only one way to ensure a successful result and that is to read, learn and inwardly digest the information found in your course study guide...there is no shortcut! In conclusion, this book did help me to find the areas of the syllabus I was weak in and approximately 45% of the questions were actually in my national exam in one form or another."
2,Book vs. EMT-1 test,I found the book didn't do a great job in preparing me for the National Test.The tests in the book were a lot easier than the National Test.I would not really recommend this guide to someone trying to prepare for the National Test.
4,EMT-Basic Exam,I thought this was a great book for people who need help before their big exam. It provides you with practice tests and scheduals on what you should do before the test. It is a good resource to have when you are studying for the exam.
3,another study book,Ordered this book to assist me in prepping for the National Registry on my EMT. NOTE KEYWORD : ASSIST. The NREMT is very detailed and studying multiple things will help you on the exam. The book provided questions and answers in the back as well as bubble answer sheets. It did seems to have current up to date material.
2,Not worth it.,While it has some relevant points most of it is just illogical and not relevant to the NREMT exam. Most of the questions in this guide were not even in the books we used for class. Using this review guide made me feel like I never passed the course in the first place as I got so many questions wrong. I knew the course material. I got an A- on our final and a B in the class yet taking the tests in this book I kept averaging only half the questions correct! This couldn't be right. I couldn't have taken the course and come out of it not prepared and knowing nothing.I stopped using it and instead got: SUCCESS! For the EMT BASIC: 2nd ed. I passed the National Registry Exam after answering only 71 questions (you have to answer a minimum of 70 so that means I did VERY VERY well). After taking the exam and looking back the SUCCESS book is far more worth your time as it also adheres to the the style of questioning that the NREMT test gives.
1,Don't Waste Your MONEY!!!,"Today (Dec. 03 2009) I took the National Exam for EMT-B and I used this book to study for the test. There was not one question in this study guide that was on the Exam, NOT ONE! It is a total waste of money and is completley off point for the national exam. It should be removed from every book store and on-line store as it will waste your time."
2,Not worth the paper it's written on,"I bought the book in hopes that it would be an additional resource to help me prepare for the NREMT. Turns out I was wrong. As I went through the book I found countless errors in questions as well as answers. Finally I just gave up on the book because it was causing me more stress than help. If you're looking for a book that's very helpful and encourages you to continue to learn new materials I highly recommed ""EMT-Basic Review: A case-based approach"" by Kaye Nagell and Neil Coker. I used the 2007 book that was based off the 2005 ECC Guidelines but there's a newer one coming out soon. The questions are challenging but it's worth the money, time and effort."
2,good for example questions-many inaccurate answers,"The book was good for example questions, there were 600 questions in the 4 tests, but when I scored the test and went back to see which questions I missed, I found that there were many inaccurate answers in the key. Such as...a question in the first test asks how many ventilations are adequate for artificial respiration? the key gave the answer of 5 and went on the say that 3 is adequate for a child. not quite- 12 for an adult and 20 for a child. There were too many to name. This really isn't good for a test that helps you do WELL on the exam- maybe a qualified instructor should review the test and its answers!"
2,Not for everyne....,"I bought this dvd set and frankly it isn't very funny. I love Ab FAb, The Vicar of Dibley, Tracey Takes On, the Catherine Tate Show, Clatterford....I appreciate the the slightly darker humor and wit of these shows.Girls On Top is very 80's in its humor, feeling dated and stale..Jennifer Saunders' character is played with a monotone, flat delivery that threatens to go unnoticed. Tracey Ullman is over the top and annoying. (As a huge Tracey Ullman fan it is hard to watch her clod her way through each scene.) Dawn French carries the weight of the show, but the scripts are pretty bad....I was bored by the predictable plots...i have not been able to watch more than 3 episodes, unfortunately I bought both sets 1 and 2. Maybe if I am able to sit through more episodes, I will find the humor in this series...but somehow I doubt it."
3,Just to let you know what this is....,It is a box... with 12 CDs inside. Each has 1 track from Vespertine on it. So the whole box = Vespertine.They are CD singles in the sense that they have 1 track each.No bonus material. No remixes.Great for a collector - but not practical.
3,Is good,"Is not complete, miss a lot of important episodes to fallow the story but I still like it is good"
4,Right on time,The DVD arrived just as I was finishing up the first two seasons. The DVD was as described. I have no complaints. I would have given it 5 stars if it had come early.
5,appreciated by an ex ipod user,"If you are a person that is not technically inclined and is incapable of reading a manual I might recommend the iPod. However, taking the minutely more confusing path pays off exponentially. The features offered by the m3 are far more powerful and useful than those of the iPod.Before buying the unit you might want to get familiar with possible problems, resolutions and features over at iaudio.com.A friend of mine uses the iRiver. The most significant difference I can find between them is the fact that the iAudio has no primary screen on the unit and looks much nicer. I am quite happy having made the change to a unit that is not a cliche status symbol (as is the iPod); the iAudio M3 is cool on its own merits not because ""everybody else is doing it"".One quick reminder: update the firmware straight out of the box (if this sounds hard, don't worry; it's not)"
2,Cheese-z,"This disc is loaded with hit songs. Unfortunatly, most of them were someone else's hit songs. I gave this review two stars because, personally, I think 'Cilla Black has a great singing voice, and that's what kept this from being a total washout. It's too bad, because she deserves better. But be that as it may, keep your money and put it in the collection plate next Sunday. You'll feel better than you will if you pony up the cost of this cd."
5,Fantastic,This is probably the single best introduction to descriptive phenomenology around. It should be mandatory reading for anyone in the mental health field.
3,Not to be confused with Golden Age of R & R...,"First, do not mistake ""Hey! Little Girl"" by The Techniques as anything remotely related to Dee Clark's classic, Bo Diddley-beat rocker. Second, skip over the ""What the heck was that?"" mistakes ""Teasin"" and ""Just Like In The Movies"", and Tony Perkins' ""Moon-Light Swim"". I am as nostalgic as you, but these will make you wish you could flip the dial on your old AM radio. Then, you are left with very enjoyable cuts from Dorsey Burnette (""Tall Oak Tree""), Adam Wade (""As If I Didn't Know""), Tony Orlando (""Bless You""), and a few others that are hard to find on CD. Probably you, as I, already have ""My Own True Love"" by the Duprees on other CDs, but I did not have the great song ""In The Misty Moonlight"" by Jerry Wallace. So what I am saying is that it's worth it to buy this high quality Ace CD if there are enough gems on here for your liking - and hope that they scrounge up 28 more records for a Golden Age of American Rock 'n' Roll, Vol. 12."
2,Oldies,"This CD was a little disappointing to me. I only found about 5 or 6 tunes that I was familiar with. However, I was delighted to find the tune ""Forever"" was what I had been looking for (for a very, very long time). It was the reason I ordered this one. That one song made the CD worth it for me."
2,Required Reading,"This book provides only a very basic understanding of gene theory. As someone who is not good at science, this worked for me. However, if you know anything about genetics or have graduated highschool within the last 8 years, go with another book. This book was required reading for a class in school."
4,A must for every Southern 'Bulb Lover!',"Garden Bulbs for the South is simply a great book. The vast majority of books on bulbs deal extensively with Tulips, Grape Hyacinths, Daffodils and other cold climate bulbs and only give cursory information about warm climate bulbs and the information often pertains to container gardening. Every northerner moving South is tempted to try growing cold climate bulbs. Reading this book is both a delight and a time and money saver. It will also assist you in trying a lot of bulbs that you might otherwise overlook. It has been one of the most read books in my gardening library."
3,Not the worst i have ever heard,But it is not the greatest- though it does offer a different taste of each artist. Worth it if you are a beginner and need variety.
1,Bad HP Support,"The support from HP is bad. There is no drivers available, nor does it comes with backup disk. You have to pay extra for the backup disk. If you want to modify the OS, you are on your own."
4,"A good computer, but...","My wife is not at all thrilled with Vista, but the computer was a good buy otherwise. When she can get programs to run, they run very quickly. She would prefer Windows XP however."
4,Great Guide to find special places,"We actually used this guide as our main guide through northestern italy. We find some amazing retsuarnts and hotels, ones you wouldn't know from the o utside. Some restaurants you absolutely need to know Italian, it seemed like they never saw a tourist before. The maps in the book are not very good, and don't show most of the places mentioned. Have a very good other, an up-to-date map.Just one word about the region: super wines, not many you will be able to purchase in the states."
3,How can this book not include Valpolicella?,"Generally, I've been pleased with this series of books -- they are very useful and informative for a wine lover travelling in any region and we have used them often. However, this book on Northeast Italy does not include the Valpolicella winegrowing region near Verona -- which produces the best red wines in Northeast Italy! It includes other winegrowing areas in the Veneto, so how can they leave out Amarone and Valpolicella?"
4,"Great Book, Poor Seller","Although I purchased a used copy that was supposed to be in ""VERY GOOD"" condition, I had to glue and tape it back together when it arrived with pages falling out and written in with obvious student notes! UGH!The seller, and Amazon, did give me a refund AND I was able to keep the book!This is a great book for people who are looking to understand the intricacies of Ballet Education! There is not a magic pill to understanding WHY Ballet helps create such beautiful and strong bodies that allow movement to appear effortless! This book is a great help if you have an open mind and a willingness to understand the difference between ""gross anatomy"" and ""functional anatomy"" and so much more!"
5,Awesome!,"One of the best books I have read that has helped me to understand having ""expectations"" in the proper spiritual sense. "" Your expectations opens or closes the door of your supply; if you expect grand things, and work honestly towards them, they will come to you, your supply will correspond to your expectation."" An invaluable work towards helping one to literally 'get their mind right!'"
4,First book I bought about friendship bracelets...,"While probably not the best book in the world to learn how to make friendship bracelets from, this is an excellent book for advanced bracelet makers to learn different techniques. The colour diagrams assisted throughout the more difficult of patterns, the descriptions/instructions easy to understand when used with the colour diagrams, and the results are very pleasing."
1,Self Serving Rubbish,"Cowardice or courage to stand up for beliefs aside, this is unmitigated rubbish. A puny attempt to re-write negative press against him, it is written is such pathetic self promotion, as to be painful.His references to him being a ""Muscular Englishman"" all of 5'3"", who seems to have led a life of petty crime across europe. He is obvioulsy trying to write a pornograpic distraction to his utter contempt for his nationality and those who fought nobly on any side.A pacifist who joined the SS does not make sense. It is infuriating reading, and the preface to works such as the Gulag Archipelago might distract you from reading that worthy tome.Don't buy this rubbish, don't even bother getting it from the library, it is purile."
1,did not last,"""Did not last"" is a strange thing the say about a chunk of iron, but after a few months of ordinary use the cooking surface developed a convex shape with oil/grease running away from the center of the pan and pooling at the edges. I have owned some cheap aluminum non sticks that were like this from the beginning, but this is the first time I have had a pan start out good and develop this defect over time."
4,So far so good,"I've found that this skillet is gaining a smooth and even surface, even with my novice experience with cast iron seasoning techniques. It definitely sears my strip steaks beautifully and cooks the insides evenly and predictably. Once I found the smoke start point of the oil and the skillet and my electric stove's burner, and so keeping the heat just below that, I find I'm getting excellent results with meat, hash browns or eggs. I see a bit of rust in very small spots on the bottom, so be aware that this skillet must be truly dried if rinsing it out between cooking sessions. But, once realized, that's doable....Good stuff!"
5,"Won't last forever, but great fun.","After a few years, ours is now leaking too much air to have more than one kid in it at once. It held together very well for about two years with just a few kids using it, but once we started bringing it to parties and gatherings and had several kids in at once, it went downhill.This will be great if you have very small kids and just keep it around for home use. I think it's pretty easy to get out and put away."
4,Recommended!,Overall great product. The kids (1 and 2 y/o) absolutely love it and it's easy to put up and take down. The slide is fantastic. The only negative aspect is that it leaks air at the seams. It still works but isn't as full as it should be.
5,Best money ever spent on a toy,"This is the best toy we've ever bought our son! Our local Toys r Us didn't have it in stock, so we found it at a [...] We used it at his 2nd birthday and all the kids had a ball (ages ranged from 2-10 years). We've set it up in the garage on rainy days and it's a great way for him to get some physical activity. It is so durable we feel it will last at least ten years. It literally inflated in 45 seconds, I timed it. Amazing. Just make sure the air vent from the motor isn't twisted or blocked. I love this thing! If I weren't 6 mos. pregnant I'd jump on it myself!"
3,Fun - but falling apart,A very fun toy - we got this for my son (4 years old) for Christmas - the big problem is the seams are splitting and air is leaking - we plan to get a refund or exchange. I am hoping this is a defective one as my son loves it so much.
4,High quality for the price,"We purchased this item for our 3 year old and his playground pals about a month ago at Toys-r-Us for $199. So far it has performed beyond our expectations. Extremely east to set-up and put away, and seems to be fairly durable. It is extremely popular with the neighborhood kids, ranging from 1 to 6 years in age. We toss 5 or 6 beach balls into ours for added fun, and the slide portion is really popular too. Watch out for a lot of bumped heads if you combine little kids with older kids. Highly recommended, although it may be a bit tame for older kids looking for more bounce and thrills."
4,Great!,My sons (4 1/2 & 2 1/2) got this for Christmas. It is the perfect size to have up in our basement and gave them hours of jumping fun(It is about 5 1/2 feet tall). They had a blast and it wore them out. It is very durable and the slide makes a great addition to the jumping feature. My only complaint is that is has a back door. My boys are pretty rough but I was concerned they would push to hard on the back side and fall out if they were not careful. Overall I would highly reccommend this toy.
5,nothing better for a rainy day,"My kids are ages 5 and 2. Their grandparents bought this for a christmas gift for them. It fits (barely) in our living room if we move around some furniture. They absolutely love it. All the kids friends love to come to our house now for playdates. Rainy days are the best because we don't feel obligated to go outside and play... so we set up this bounce house and it's hours of fun. It comes with vinyl patches for tears.... we did get one tear finally after 5 months - but it was because we had 7 kids in it at once :) ... the patch fixed it right up and we are good to go again. We bought the little plastic balls, too.... the kids love it. It's a lot of clean up, afterward, though... but worth it. We have never used it outside yet, but one of our friends has it outside in his backyard. It's awesome. It's also portable! We've brought it to 3 different friends and families homes to play with it. I highly recommend this item :)"
4,Great toy,"I just gave this to my 2 grandsons for Christmas, ages 4 & 8 who live with me. This is a great toy we set it up in the house for them and they had a blast on it. Set up and take down is very easy, even the 8 year old loved the slide. I'm very glad I got it, its going to be great to have this this winter as we live in the north and get lots of cold and snow and it makes it hard for them to go out side and run around."
2,poor durability,"We purchased a Little Tikes bouncer and used it only 5 times. The seam on the slide split apart, so we called Little Tikes expecting some sort of solution to our problem, because it came with a 1 year warranty card. We were told that ""there's nothing we can do because that only covers the blower and the warranty on the bouncer is only good for 90 days."" So, no matter how much money you spend or how many times you use it, 'there's nothing they can do.' It's very disappointing that a big company like Little Tikes doesn't stand behind products that are manufactured poorly."
5,Perfect bounce house for young kids (2-5),"After seeing my kids play in one of these at a friends house, we had to buy it. My 19 mth old and 4 yr old play in it every day and love it. Very easy to setup and tear down (5 minutes each and that includes packing it into the bag). I would certainly recommend this for young kids. If your kids are 5 and up I wouldn't recommend due to the size and weight limitations."
1,Cheaply Made!,"We purchased this for my sons 3rd birthday. The second time we set it up, the seam split in one of the corners! arghh!!! I also noticed that it does not get as hard ( and therfore not as bouncy) as others we have tried. I am returning it!also-measurements include the slide-not the total inside bounce area-misleading as no other companies do this without giving seperate measurements..."
3,Sturdy.... to a point.,"This ended up splitting down the slide area... once that happened in the seam, there was no fixing it... it frayed and split and was destin for the trash heap!"
4,why so expensive on Amazon?,love this bouncer and wanted to buy one but it is double the price on Amazon compared to what it is at ToysRUs so guess where I am buying...
4,Good practice,This putting green is great for practice. Worked great from the time that I opened it. the ability to send the ball back even when you hit the hazards is great. I spent about a half hour putting and only used one ball never having to move from my spot.
1,Garbage!,"This product is a piece of junk. The ""scenery"" is cheesy. The ""sand trap"" and ""water hole"" are stickers. The automatic ball return broke after the 4th putt, and you have to mail (and pay for postage) the whole thing back to the manufacturer to fix it under the warranty. Spend a little more money on something that will last."
4,Great putting matt for the price.,"This is a great little putting matt for minimal price (under $8 at the time purchased). Balls do sometimes jam in the mechanism and the kick-back motor does sometimes get weak if you sink several puts in quick succession, but for the price it's a perfect indoor/winter/office practice aid. I do not use the back-stop (looks cheap, wavy plastic) and very rarely have putts go off the back (thanks to the ""sand trap"" and ""water hazard"").One thing to remember, due to the incline near the cup, it's easy to ""ram in"" puts that likely wouldn't fall in the real world. The best puts on this matt are the ones that just barely make it into the cup."
3,Ok album bu nothing mindblowing,"This is a solid power/progressive album from a band that comes out of Serbia. These guys are exellent musicians tecnicly speaking but i feel that they lack creativity side of song writing. This album also lacks originality in a sence that there are thousands of bands that sound the same or very similar to this band. If you want something original and different than get ""Triumph of The King"" by another serbian band called ""TORNADO"".Hail Metal!"
2,Did they record with casettes?,"This album is poorly mastered. It's pretty bad.The album, music-wise, is okay, but nothing mindblowing. I don't know if it is worth what I paid. The mastering and producing of this album kills whatever it had going for it, anyway. The sound is so condensed and the effects are pretty bad. I couldn't sworn I heard someone or something hit a mic during one of the songs. That's unacceptable."
4,Overview,"In its way, this has everything going for it. Compiled by the top specialists, printed on glossy paper, illustrated throughout with fine line-drawings and with a section of excellent color photographs. The color photographs are brought together in a single section in the middle of the book, and the quality has to be seen to be believed.The down-side of this book (such as it is) is its format: it crams together basic information on an enormous amount of plant families in a single volume. It therefore is, of necessity, limited to broad outlines and offers an overview only."
5,Best C++ Reference Book,"This is not a tutorial, but an excellent quick reference. You simply lookup the functionality that you need. The right hand page shows the functionality in short, working code. With notations by the author explaining the code and how each piece of the functions works. While the left hand page has a narrative about the callouts on the right hand side. The book is just what the title says a C++ Reference NoteBook."
3,BEWARE: Metal Bra Strap Adjusters,I was pleased with this bra..except..the metal bra adjusters on the straps. They seem to work well enough but they are on the front of the bra and near the armpit area. So when I move and reach they dig into my shoulder. And for being a big cup girl I expected the bra straps to be padded..they are not..so they do dig it too. I believe if you buy the correct size then you should be fine with this bra.
1,Factory reject,"This bra is defective, it is not labelled correctly. The cup size is incorrect therfore I had to return the item. One of the reasons why I am very cautious when making online purchases. I do not think I will purchase lingerie from Amazon again as some of the vendors donot allow you return the merchandise."
3,Have hopes,"I received this bra today in the mail. I am large busted (36I) and the bra fits exactly as the Godess Website says it should. It feels really good and I actually really like the adjustment of the straps in the front! So far the clips seem to support my heavy breasts in it just fine, BUT the shape is extremely pointy. This in and of itself wouldn't be too bad, but the headlights seem to shine at the shoulders of the road, so to speak, rather than forward making the overall look odd. It is nice to finally have 2 instead of one big tube though, so I may keep it and pray that they cups soften up some and start appearing a bit more natural.ETA: Straps slip off the shoulders ALL THE TIME and the clips are starting to dig as others had mentioned. I wish I'd have sent it back after all. :o("
5,This is Great Intertainment,We really love this video. Just showed it again to some company the other day who hadn't seen it before. It is intertaining.
5,Good product,"This is a really nice product. It is totally organic and unrefined, just what I wanted."
4,Coconut oil is the best oil for high heat cooking!!,"I've cooked with organic coconut oil for a long time now and when this product came up, I decided to see if there is any difference between the fresh coconut oil I am using or this item which is made from dried coconuts. I could tell no difference in performance. Neither oil tastes of coconuts but is simply healthier to use than highly processed vegetable oils. My only complaint with this oil is that it is sold in a plastic container. I've never understood why a company would choose to put an organic product in plastic. The container is the reason I deducted one star and is the reason I probably will not buy this oil until or if they choose to sell it in a glass container. Either can be recycled but glass is free of chemicals. Otherwise, I recommend the oil itself."
3,Jarrow Formulas Coconut Oil,"This expeller pressed Jarrow coconut oil made specifically for cooking is good for people who want the benefits of coconut oil without any coconut taste. Disadvantages with this type of oil: it is not a virgin oil, has no natural oil flavor(in this case coconut), and it did not do well with high temperature cooking, which includes frying and deep-frying. With high temperature cooking the oil and food would burn easily. It did well with all other types of cooking and baking."
4,First time trying...now a staple,"This was my first experience with any type of coconut oil. Mine came packaged well and intact. I had difficulty pulling the the black ring off to unscrew it. No smell or a very neutral smell.I love it and it is now a staple in the house. Main reason is versitility. I can sub this out in various dishes, just as a way to incorporate it into our meals and my kids don't notice. But I can turn around and dab a little on my daughter's sensitive skin. It has no smell on the skin. I've also taken the advice of other reviewers and add a little to my dog's diet.Honestly, it's a decent price to have something around the house that can be used in so many ways. I wouldn't be without it."
3,Good But Gritty,"I really like coconut oil. I found that if your body is damp it will absorb in your skin better. The taste is mild, but it is VERY gritty. I am a texture person, curtain textures I don't like. Grit is one of them. That also made it hard to rub into my skin. My acne and exema is much better though."
3,OK,"JUST OK..DIDN'T TRY IT FOR COOKING..I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HAIR, BUT IT LEFT IT FEELING HARD, BUT IT'S PROBABLY GOOD FOR OTHER PURPOSES..HAS A FAINT SMELL"
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with ths product since the one in the picture is not what i recieved. I got the one that is ""neutral taste, neutral flavor"". I do not cook with it, i use it for skin and hair. I was expecting it to have at least some scent of coconut, but it does not. It doen't have any smell at all. I guess you get what you pay for. Too bad i opened it before noticing."
3,"Nice product, annoying packaging","I love coconut oil and have been using it for everything from hair care to cooking. I have used other Jarrow products and was impressed so I was confident that this would be high quality.Opening the jar posed a challenge. There is a plastic strip that needs to be torn off.But there was no tab by which to pull it off. I have some stiffness in my hands and found it impossible to pull off the strip by hand. I finally dug the start of the strip out with a screw driver. This seems like packaging overkill. When I opened the jar (at long last) I noticed that the product was quite a bit lower than the top of the jar.But the quality of this oil is fine. It looks, cooks, and smells clean and pure. It has worked nicely."
5,Everyone Should Use This,"A bold headline, huh? Yes, everyone SHOULD use coconut oil. Make sure that it isorganic. Coconut oil has many healing properties; too many to list here. It iscomposed of medium chain triglycerides and is metabolized quickly in the body.Aside from the fact that it provides almost immediate energy, it is rich inimmune boosting nutrients. Coconut oil has been used to treat a wide varietyof medical conditions, and as of late is being used as a brain supplement.You may cook with it or just have a few tablespoons per day straight from thejar. If you choose to have a few spoons of it per day, start with a teaspoonand build from there. This will allow your digestive system to get used to theoil. This is one supplement to my diet that I make sure to never run out of!"
4,More uses than you'd think,"My wife has a tub of this stuff in the bathroom and has found about a million uses for this stuff. It has some magical healing/beauty powers for every part of your body and you could even eat it if you wanted to. We slather a little bit of it on our face as moisturizer, should last about a year before we need another tub. Next I'm going to use it as deodorant. Really."
4,Taste great when you cook with it but that's not all.,I first got coconut oil to increase my energy but then I saw a video on youtube about a woman who put this in her husband's oatmeal every morning and she said it greatly improved his dementia. I have no personal experience with that and I am not a professional on this topic. But I have read all the latest on that and it does seem that the struggling brain is lacking oils like this and or omega 3s.I like cooking with it but it does have a pretty strong flavor. I find it goes best if you want to add more of a sweet than savory flavor to something. It is a great addition to french toast for example! This brand says all the things you look for on a label to make sure it is as healthy and organic as possible so I was impressed there. I would like to be able to just eat a tea spoon a day by itself but it is too oily for me so I just add it to my food instead. The price was better here than anywhere else I have bought it.
3,Jarrow Coconut OIl 16 oz.,"The coconut oil product is fine, but the packaging made using this product an awful experience. The container isplastic & so cheaply made that the oil leaks after the seal is broken... to the point it makes a mess in the kitchen. The only answer is to put the contents into another container.I will not purchase it again for this reason.Instead, I am buying Nutiva brand (64 oz.) in a heavy plastic jar with a good quality screw top lid. Much better choice at only a few pennies more."
3,No taste,"I should have noticed on the packaging that this particular jar of coconut oil has ""neutral taste"" which means, it's flavorless. Good, I suppose, if you don't like the flavor of coconut and only want the health benefits. Also good if you want to use it on your skin and not smell like the beach. I prefer the Extra Virgin (full flavored) coconut oil that Jarrow makes. Again, this says to keep it refrigerated for freshness. I think I'll take my chances and keep it in the cabinet instead, that way I can easily use it instead of trying to chisel some out of the container. Nice product, I just prefer the other more."
3,Surprised by the ease of use,"Having never used a product like this before, I was skeptical from the beginning, but after using a few times as a spread and as an ingredient in baking. Though it is said to have a neutral flavor, I could certainly taste the coconut, not overpowering, but a nice aftertaste. I don't know that I will continue to buy this product, but it is something I will think about."
4,"Coconut oil is great, but this one has no odor/flavor to it","I have recently become a fan of coconut oil, and at its simplest form, it is a great product, especially when it is organic and cold pressed. This oil will work fine for cooking, but I also like to use it as a moisturizer and as a treat for my cats and dog. The only problem I have with this one is that it has no odor or much taste at all. I don't feel it is very coconutty, which might be great for some people, but I have found my favorite oil, and will stick with it,Kelapo Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Jar. The Kelapo oil has a wonderful coconut smell, I personally think it smells like a delightful Almond Joy candy bar. My cats love it, and if you put some on as a moisturizer, it has a nice smell to it."
3,interesting but nothing news,"Stephanie Camilleri has researched a lot of natal charts (some 1500) to write this book. That's a lot of data, but I think that it could be better. With Lois M. Rodden's AstroDatabank (containing 20000 horoscopes) one should be able to look for more indepth interpretations. Stephanie's book is interesting, but I miss some sparkling new and innovate delineations.I miss the rulerships too. It certainly is a good book for beginners."
3,How Bizarre!,"This is the first time I actually write a review. I've been studying astrology for the past eight years, and recently have collected quite a few astrology books. I was so excited when I ordered this book, since I truly believe that there are VERY few books out there that truly focus on the placements of planets in the houses, and I had been looking for something like this forever it seemed like! However, I was truly dissappointed when I read this book, I found it bizarre that she is almost fixated with the idea that so many placements are a ""partial testimony to homosexuality""! This is a common theme throughout this book!I have nothing against homosexuality, but it is shocking to read it over and over again! Its rediculous!"
2,Far From State Of The Art,This is a halogen incandescent bulb headlight designed to be driven by a bicycle hub dynamo or a so called sidewall or bottle dynamo.it is inexpensive but the light output is minimal compared to many LED dynamo headlights available. In order to prevent the light bulb burning out at high speed Shimano installs a 9.6v 5 watt bulb even though the dynamos that power the light are nominally 6v and 3 watts. This bulb choice greatly decreases the light output at mormal riding speeds. Far better would be for Shimano to install a voltage regulator circuit and a bulb that is closer to the nominal dynamo output.Much brighter LED dynamo headlights are available from multiple manufacturers that most people should find more satisfactory. Take a look on Peter White Cycles web site for extensive dynamo headlight information.
1,Pointless,"I got caught in the dark tonight and realized just how worthless this light really is. It's fine for letting someone coming in the opposite direction know you're there. It's pointless for its intended purpose of lighting your way.Off to find a replacement bulb per the other review on this product, or, a better solution altogether to connect to my Shimano Alfine dynamo hub (something with battery power and the ability to be recharged on the fly would make more sense...consistent light output no matter the speed)."
3,Meh.,"I agree with other reviewers - not an amazing product. Shimano's marketing materials make it out that having a light attached to a generator is incredible, amazing, awesome. OR you can just have a battery-powered light and replace (or recharge) the batteries every so often! My particular problem with the light-generator combo is twofold (after owning them for four years): (1) The wire attaching the lamp to my generator hub has begun to fray; and (2) the bracket attaching the lamp to my handlebar broke -- the plastic just snapped, and needs to be replaced. I think the trouble of this complicated system isn't worth it - go battery-powered LED instead."
5,The Paris Metro: A Travel Companion,"THE PARIS METRO: A ticket to French HistorySusan L. PlotkinThe Paris Metro is a marvelous companion for your travels in Paris. If you can't get to Paris you can enjoy Paris by reading this wonderfully descriptive and interesting book while you stay at home. Using the architecture and art of the Paris Metro stations as a vehicle into the history of France you can travel with Susan Plotkin from the past into the present glories of Paris. The Paris Metro, a meticulously researched and well documented book, that includes drawings and photographs, entices you to travel not only to Paris, but to look at other great and small cities through the lens of their unique infrastructures. I highly recommend this book for personal pleasure as well as a gift for the travelers in your life."
2,missing pictures in the kindle edition,"although the book is very informative and well written, the picture are missing in the kindle edition. Since this is a book that needs the pictures, it is not worth buying the kindle version"
2,More Amusing than Useful,"Full of jargon, slang, offhand opinions, and philosophical advice, but lacking in detailed or systematic descriptions of techniques, this book might be of use to moderately advanced boulderers but was useless to this newbie. Hey, John, do you want to tell us what some of these terms mean, or maybe provide a glossary or an index?This book was dialed in by a guy who gives the impression that he was more interested in his self-presentation to the world as a cool-and-laid-back-yet-knowledgable dude than in conveying useful information. Not recommended."
2,"basics, just stuff you know","this book would be great for someone who has never seen a problem in their life but i've been bouldering for about 5 months and I'm working V5 problems and this book didn't tell me anything i didn't know. I'm not saying i know everything but the information given can and should have been attained after a few months of serious climbing. Again i'm sure the author knows more than i will ever know but he didn't go past the ""duh"" advice in his book. Waste of money for advanced climber seeking improvement. Great for green climber looking to get started. Rock on. Nice move. Go static."
3,logical thinking never saved anyone,"Most of this book is a list of questions to ask Jehovah's Witnesses and their possible answers. The author is obviously a very clever man and his questions very thoght-provoking.However, it should be noted that these questions are based more on logic than on the Word of God. If you witness to a clever JW, he may be able to find some answer: perhaps a nonsensical answer, but enough to keep his confidence in the Watchtower Society. Logic and philosophy never saved anyone, what is needed is God's Word and the ministry of the Holy Spirit."
1,Waste of time,"If you want to ""witnesss"" to one of Jehovah's Witnesses, do what Jesus commanded his followers to do, go out and preach and make disciples (Matt 28:19), and seek them out. If you are not interested, trust me it is not taken personally. Jehovah's Witnesses respect their neighbors and their beliefs. No organization has fought more for the first amendment rights, for everyone's benefit, not just their own. This book is a classic example of a bitter former JW, It's quit simple, in sports if you don't follow the rules, what happens? That's right you get disqualified or booted from the team. Likewise when God's high standards, outlined in his word are not adhered too, then that person is removed. Simple. The author, if he chose to not be one of Jehovah's Witnesses any longer, should first of all, stop being bitter and find something more productive to do with his time, as most former members should do also. (...)"
5,one of the best,"This book is one of the best ones along with some of Reed books. This book helps the reader comunicate with Jehovah Witnesses without arguing and without getting defensive. It helps you to establish ground rules when getting ready for a Bible study with JW. the author, an ex Jehovah witness himself is very compassionate in the way he talks about JW and teaches the reader to do the same. This book will give you the essencial tools to get started in your way to effective witnessing. It is a must in one's personal library."
5,Just Awsome,"I first bought Show Chrome bars, installed on my Honda 750 shadow spirit, they looked huge on my bike and just barely cleared turn singnal light 1/4"" ,not good. Got these NC Paladin bars to replace them. Perfect size on this bike and they are much stronger bolting to the frame instead or the radiator bolt like SC's. Some reviews said the top U-bolts or too short, if u follow the instructions and put bottom of bar on the outside of footpeg bracket they are too short, but if u put the bars between the frame and the footpeg bracket they fit perfect, and look great, worth every penny"
5,Irresistible!,"They broke the mold after they made Elizabeth Taylor--and I love this book. She has so much, and yet her spirit of fun and generosity come through here as she shares these stunning photos and personal recollections. Wouldn't it be fun to have lunch with her and hear more?After reading this I was inspired to buy a lovely blank book and write down my own memories of my (okay, much smaller than Liz's) jewelry collection. Maybe someday my children or grandchildren will enjoy these family stories as I am enjoying Elizabeth's."
3,Liz - what's the story?,"I've read it (or glanced through it since most of the pages are pictures) and my only comment is: Liz, why can't you buy your own jewels? How many men do you have to please, whine and cajole in order to have them buy you hugely expensive (and often gaudy) baubles?She is one of the last great Hollywood stars and an extremely philanthropic woman, but, COME ON! How much does one need? And, for those who have read the book, does anyone out there believe it when she says that ""anyone"" can touch and try on her jewels? Somehow, I don't think so."

1,This is a puff piece for the author,"Most of the book is a description of the author's own life and praise for her own young adult books. The title is completely misleading.There are a few pieces of good and useful information here, but they are buried beneath the rest of it."
2,Good in description only,"Bought this last year on clearance for this year. Installed it. Thought it was going to be quiet. Boy was I wrong. That thing is loud and it rattles. When the fan is on, it's okay, but when the compressor kicks in, that's when the major noise happens.I've used it for 2 months and now the compressor died. I have to call service and have the damn thing fixed. Good thing it has a 2-year warranty on it, otherwise I would have been stuck with a really expensive window fan.If you're thinking of buying it because of a good price - don't. It's not worth it."
1,"Cools well, for a freight train","Bought this last summer, used it about a month and didn't have any noise problems. Put it back in the window this summer and it's driving me insane. I can't sleep, I can't hear my television. Every time it kicks on in the night it wakes me up. While the fan is running it's a near constant metallic rattle. Terrible. Would like to find a high building in an abandoned section of the city and throw it off."
4,Good place to start...,"If you're trying to learn about amino acids this book is a good place to start. At just over 100 pages it's a bit short. For instance, the amino acid serine is covered in seven lines. It's also approaching 20 years old. Having said that it still provides a lot of useful info. And combined with ""The Amino Revolution"" by Robert Erdmann, PH.D., it can give you a pretty good idea of the potential benefits of amino acid supplementation. There's so much more to learn on this topic and I'm still waiting for the definitive amino acid book. Unfortunately, most doctors don't have a clue."
3,Reads like a graduate school dissertation,"Very little practical infoAn egghead writing forother eggheadsIn other words "" it went completely overmy head""I will continue my search"
4,A Wonderful Experience,The soul fulfilling voice of Andrea was complemented by the rest of the cast. A very entertaining DVD.
1,item no longer available,I was told that the item was no longer available and they credited my account
3,Disappointed,"After waiting what seemed like forever,I received the video 'Christmas from Westminster'. I was very much impressed by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and by the readings. This video could not stand up to the claim that it starred 'Andrea Bocelli'.He sang several versions of 'Ave Maria', but he came across either as not well or not into the spirit of the occasion. I am a great fan of his and hate any negative words about him. I am constantly sing his praises to everyone I know and have gotten him many new fans"
4,Great Without Charlotte Church,"This is a classic Christmas album with some of the world's greatest voices. And the setting is one of the world's great vocal settings in Westminster Abbey. Most notable among the vocalists is Andrea Bocelli and Bryn Terfel. The one drawback to this collection is the inclusion of Charlotte Church. Even singing in an area which is her strength, you cannot help but notice her lack of range, lack of vocal control, and incredible lack of emotion. It would have been better for all if Miss Church had stepped back into the participating choir where she is among peers. Fortunately, on Silent Night, we hear the great Bartione voice of Bryn Terfel coming through in spite of Miss Church's best efforts to drown it out. There are many classic moments here which make this video well worth its price despite the presense of Charlotte Church"
4,Some Great Voices Here,"To hear singing anytime from Westminster is a treat, but to hear some of the greatest voices of our time singing therein was awe inspiring; especially the selections herein. The only negative to this entire album is the inclusion of Charlotte Church. Her voice is nothing more than that of a choir girl. They would have been better off by just puting her in the choir and leaving the serious singing to someone who has has range and vocal control. But this video is worth purchasing in spite of Charlotte."
2,Too little of Andrea Bocelli,"This was OK, but not quite what I'd hoped for. It's basically the same program as Kings College on PBS. Lovely, but I'd hoped for more of Andrea Bocelli."
3,"Good set, but No Black included.","The colors included in this set are good for convenience, however, we could have bought them anywhere, AND there was NO BLACK ICING included."
3,Leslie Gore still has it!!,"This was a great interview DVD with Leslie Gore done a few years ago. She still has a great voice. One issue is that they did not include any of her songs all the way through -- just ""snippets""! They should have included several of her top hits (complete), and several live songs from her latest tours!"
4,"Not bad, but not great.","This album is not too bad, I prefer Hanson from the early MMMbop years when they were young and rocked. It seems all artists record great music that sells well, but they're not happy with it so they want to do something else, even if it doesn't sell anything, at least they are happy with it.Hanson has now done their thing, and if they don't want to go back to songs like MMMbop, then at least find a middle ground! Something the label, the band, and the fans can all agree on. Not just art for art sake but art that can be enjoyed and make a little money!I say that the Hanson brothers include some of their other family. They are not the only siblings, there are others. Let's see what the whole family can do!Love, AshleyP.S. Try reading the Adventures With Boys book series if U want something that truely rocks!"
3,Why so tribal?,"I am a Hanson fan from way back. I bought this CD because I was curious to see how they sounded now-a-days. There are a few really good songs (in my opinion) like ""Been There Before"" and ""Georgia"".. there are a few o-k songs and a few that I just don't really jive with. The thing I don't like is the whole African tribal children singing.. it's just weird. Oh well."
3,Mature in vocals and production; no new instrumental talent,"The title of my review pretty much sums it up. This album sounds great in its vocals and production, but the instrumentation remains stagnant. There are a lot of repetitive riffs in upbeat songs that easily invite experimentation. It's time for Hanson to use more fun/complicated lines, especially on the piano and guitar. I'm not talking about Zeppelin-style solos, just some tiny frills. Take for example ""If Only,"" a song from Hanson's previous album -- the lively harmonica approaches what I'm talking about, though they could have done more with it. I want to hear that someone other than the vocalist feels the emotion of the music."
3,"For Hanson, completely average.","I bought this album because a) I've always been impressed with these guys and b) the reviews here have been for the most part positive.Since ""Mmmbop"" and the ""Middle of Nowhere"" album, I have enjoyed much of their music. Even the Christmas album, as there is something about talented kids singing holiday songs that just sounds right.I thought some of their later work was unjustly ignored...""Runaway Run"" etc.I think this album is completely average. There is nothing that jumps out, nothing that makes you immediately go back and listen to again...nothing that'll have you humming afterwards...Hey...the three brothers are accomplished beyond their years, sing well and by all standards are a proficient, skilled musical group.It's just that this collection of songs...as ""songs""...aren't that good...And this coming from a fan."
4,Hanson's The Walk,"This album is one of Hanson's best. It has some accoustical sounds with a Capella influence. It sounds live,and has a great sound quality."
4,Really great (and not just for old fans),"I couldn't possibly give Hanson a bad review (yes, I'm one of the girls that went gaga over them as a pre-teen), but this CD really is great.They've just grown up more, and because of that they've developed their musical skills even more. The music reminds me a bit of their later CD's, but it's nothing like the ""Mmmbop"" days.The music is a little bit indie rock, still poppy, and great for just rocking out to. Zac Hanson really got a chance to shine this time around as well.I would recommend this to old fans and people who have never listened to Hanson before. They simply sound like a great rock band, and they really are all very talented."
3,Not your usual Hanson...,"I guess the boys decided to switch gears. I don't think they necessarily should have stuck to their previous pop, radio friendly format, but this album just doesn't do it for me. I actually spent the $25 for the import because I couldn't wait for the U.S. release and really wish I hadn't. I gave it three stars because I have to give Taylor, Isaac and Zac props for always staying true to themselves, writing their own songs, playing their own instruments, taking their careers into their own hands etc. It's not horrible by any means, but no one song stands out as ""Wow, I need to hear that over and over!"" Sorry guys!"
3,Not their best,"This album is defintely different than their previous albums, not as commercial-sounding. Maybe that's good, in a way. The guitar work far exceeds what was on the others, and the lyrics are pouring from their hearts, as ususal, but the tunes themselves are just not as catchy. I agree that the last two songs on this release are among the best on the album, but I enjoyed this album less than each of their other releases."
5,FANTASTIC! I would expect no less...,"from a group of extremely talented young men. i will always love what they come out with. i really enjoy the music and always have since 1997. my kids now enjoy it too! if you like their past stuff, if you like indie stuff, or rooney or anything along the rockish/popish stuff you'll love it! i do! but i have an EXTREMELY wide taste in music!"
5,Brilliant adaptation with surrealist undertones,"This trippy claymation adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's classic tale of The Little Prince is both stunning to watch and emotionally memorable. The narration by Cliff Robertson helps keep the story going, and since most of his dialouge is straight from the book, it provides the insights and intricacies of the human heart that can never be perfectly transferred to the screen.The way that this adaptation makes use of color and sound could only be from the 70s, and while this is clearly a children's short film, adults can enjoy it too. Much of it even seems specifically made for those viewers who may be in an altered state of some sorts.For those who like the book, this is a great transfer to screen, entirely unpretentious and childlike in it's presentation, in the same way the book is."
3,"Unique in presentation and execution, but little more...","Few seem to remember this claymation version of ""The Little Prince,"" which unfortunately isn't too surprising, even though the art itself is executed wonderfully. The original book is much too strong to be solidly translated into a narrated eye-candy short. This was bested a thousand-fold both by the other work of Will Vinton's studio (see ""Martin the Cobbler,"" ""Dinosaur,"" and perhaps even the California Raisins specials) and by the animated show a few years later, which proved far more poignant despite the target audience of children. While ultimately better than the '74 live-action movie, it does nothing more than add an abridged, artsy spin to a story that's superior in its original text format.Those who love claymation and/or anything having to do with The Little Prince will find more to savor here; devotees of the original book or the animated ""The Adventures of the Little Prince"" may see this as a denigration in an artful guise."
3,the little prince,My son loved the Velveteen Rabbit made by clay classics but did not like this movie.
2,A flower by any other name...,"Having recently purchased most of Vinton's classics, and being a big fan of ""The adventures of Mark Twain"", I was a little surprised by this one. Children are unlikely to fully understand ""The Little Prince"", unless they are somewhat like the Simpson's Martin Prince. Watching this was for me one of those wtf (why the face?) moments. It was just, well odd, but not the sort of fascinating odd, that would see me watching this again.These films, along with Martin the Cobbler, are only 27 minutes long. And it's about a boy, from another planet, who misses his talking flower. Enough said."
3,"A likeable, but not great disc.","Joan Ryan seems to possess the ability and talent of an above average songstress. A bought this CD over six months ago, and after giving it a couple of playings, I have lost interest in it. Considering the number of discs I have that I like to play frequently, I would have to say that this production goes into the dispensable category. Not that I would call it bad or a disaster, it just doesn't belong on the ""exceptional"" list."
2,"Good in theory, terrible quality.","I wish that the product information was a little more clear with the quality of the chess set. It's made of poor quality vinyl, is very flimsy, doesn't fold out all the way or lay flat. The magnets are great! If only the rest of the set was made of quality material with quality construction."
4,Great portable game set!,"I bought two of them and send one to a friend overseas and were playing chess , it makes it really easy with the letter and number grid to send moves via email. The magnets are really strong that keeps pieces on the game board."
1,Supremely awful and absurd,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read: juvenile, pathetically poorly written, historically devoid of *any* semblance of truth and shallow beyond belief. Eva Braun did write 20 pages of a real diary in 1935 and these torn-out extracts survive and are authentic. They reveal several things: Hitler was completely normal sexually (though he did ignore her for long bouts) and he did care for her, though he wasn't passionately enamored with her. She was with him, however. They had a normal, prosaic relationship, devoid of sado-mashochism or other ridiculous perversions detailed here.It obviously bothers people that a mass murderer could still function normally between the sheets with his mistress and for this reason, trashy books like this are written and find a market. Anyone who lays credence in the idiotic nonsense between the covers of this tome need to seriously consult a non-fiction source on Eva Braun. This is the nadir of published material on her."
1,"Horribly biased, unimaginative, boring...","I picked this up because it was in the autobiography/biography section in my library, causing me to believe that it was actual nonfiction, based entirely on factual evidence. A cursory reading quickly led me to believe this could ONLY be fiction. the Eva Braun depicted is such a horrible, slightly deranged, immature, racist, (add more bad things) person, that it gets to the point where it's just not believable anymore.If you want to read a completely biased fictional biography, read this, but otherwise, if you're the slightly bit objective, i suggest you pick up something else."
3,waste of space,this woman was a selfish shallow dumb woman.who thought about only herself and her crazy evil boyfriend.
1,PREJUDICE,"BY CALLING EVA BRAUN SELFISH, TYRANNICAL , RACIST, NARCISSIST AND CRUEL , THE AUTHOR HAD SIMPLE SPEW HER OWN RACIST VENOM AND HAD DONE GREAT INJUSTICE TO HISTORY."
4,3d movie,Be aware to get the full affect you need shutter glasses with software and a transmitter that hooks up to 3d ready tv's. This will all cost about $200.
3,Cover art,On the cover they don't look like flies to me. They look like robots. If they are supposed to be flies shouldn't they look like flies.
1,Fly Me To The Moon 3D,"I enjoyed the movie; however, the vendor whom I purchased it from send me the 2D version and never responded to my inquiry about a replacement. I will never order from this supplier again. Amazon.com should know I feel this supplier is a sham."
4,Great Childrens Movie,Great Movie! Our church did a free movie night as an outreach to the community and everyone was extremely pleased. The movie has excellent 3D effects and a great story that was interesting for adults as well as the children. The one DVD has both the 3D and the normal video mode which is also very helpful. Enjoy!
3,Good in 2D,This is a cute movie but I bought it for the 3D aspect and it is not done well at all. My grandson even asked me to switch to 2D.
1,Fly Me To The Moon - 3D - DVD,The 3D version of this movie is terrible and it is not worth purchasing just for 3D. It has double images. The movie in 2D is better than the 3D version. Don't waste your money if you are purchasing just for the 3D effect.
3,Works...,"I will give this review 3 stars instead of one or two... I agree, this movie does not give me a headache like Spy Kids 3D did. In some scenes, the 3D looks superb, but in just about every other scene, I see crappy double vision. I don't understand why every other scene looks good, then crappy. Good, then crappy."
2,I know why I never heard of this movie before,"It's a great, safe, kid-friendly movie, however it really just doesn't have a very good plot. My kids had trouble staying interested and I fell asleep!"
5,"Interesting Story, 3D a little Over Done at Times","I had never heard of this movie before. I just bought it based on the fact that it is anaglyph 3D and I could watch it at home on standard equipment. The movie is well made and the story interesting. They do exaggerate the 3D effect sometimes with flies flying directly at the camera, etc, but overall is was a pleasant 3D experience."
4,Skateboarders will like this,"My son is almost 11 and really likes this game. I think he enjoys picking out the gear as much as the game.The only violence is a guy who punches you out when you skate to close, my son hasn't figured it out yet . . He just enjoys skaing all around and trying to do the challenges."
1,Buyers be aware!,"Seller advertised as normal inflated ball, but arrived as completely deflated, which means I have to buy ball inflater, contact the seller for false advertisement, seller want me to send back with my own return shipping, complained Amazon buyer protection program, heard i have reach the life time coverage, which I don't understand how can that kind of limit be applied since I was a customer over 6 years, purchased over $5000, from Amazon, with about 10 returns, all from seller's problem. Amazon have to have a better customer care policy, since this is not fair for the customer. Seller didn't refund or anything--I wasted the money on this stupid ball because seller's false advertisement w Amazon's ignorant customer service."
1,yet another mindless sop to the betrayed.,"How many different books are necessary to tell the same cliched story? This book covers only the most general of affair types and was no help to me in trying to understand my own situation, though I've spoken to so many people who have shared my experiences with infidelity. I'm tired of reading books that tell me what I want to hear. Why doesn't someone write something with hard but ultimately helpful truths? This is just another way to funnel blame and anger in one direction, and for that there are far better books on the market."
3,How can she advise on a situation she's never been in?,"Dr. Glass says herself that she has been married to her high school sweetheart for 40 years and infidelity has never darkened her door.So, since she has never been in this situation, how can she advise people who have?"
5,This is THE Book for Those Recovering from Infidelity,"I never thought this would be me needing a book like this. My husband is not ""the type"" to have an affair, but he did. It blew my world apart. This book helped explain why it happened, how it was not because we had a bad marriage, how to recover, and it validated all the feelings and thoughts I was having. This book is truly amazing. Glass really left a gift for so many people in writing this book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and SO HELPFUL."
5,Help to get through a very hard time,"This book helped me immensely upon finding out that my husband was having an affair. Although some of the information is hard to read, it made me feel better to know that I am not alone in this situation. It could have been my story on some of the pages. I recommend it to help you process the affair. Very worth the money."
5,Read this book!,Excellent book. Extremely helpful in explaining and understanding things from both sides. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has been through this experience. It perfectly describes many issues and how to heal.
5,Great Help,"Even though my husband and I have just started this book, it has already proven to be such a remarkable insight into his affair. We are only 6 months from ""D"" day, and really look forward to continuing the read."
4,Book content seems helpful,"The book content, although I've not read very far yet, seems to be spot on the subject. However, I purchased this book in ""like new"" condition, and I wouldn't have given it a ""good"" rating. Many of the pages are creased ""dog eared"" both directions, there are written notes throoughout the book, as well as arrows drawn to highlight certain passages in ink. Will definitely NOT be buying from this vendor again! I'm VERY particular about the quality of the books in my library, and this book's condition is definitely sub par. Shame on this vendor for misrepresenting this book's condition'!!"
5,"""Not Just Friends"": Protect your Relationship from Infidelit","I am a fifty-something mother of four and primary caregiver to my live-in, ailing, aging mother-in-law. I recently discovered my husband's deep emotional bond with my best friend. ""Not Just Friends"" was recommended to me by our family therapist and I have found it to be very helpful in guiding me through this emotional nightmare. The chapters on vulnerabilties and forgiveness are especially intuitive. Dr. Glass's expertise dealing with trauma recovery has given me hope and comfort. If you are in the midst of revelation and are searching for guidance, this book will exceed your expectations."
5,"I am not crazy, and neither are you.","Dr. Glass's book was absolutely amazing to me. After trying to ignore, deny, confront, forgive, explain, rinse and repeat--well, I truly thought I was the definition of insanity. Doing the same things, over and over, expecting different results, with no idea how to begin to really heal.Since reading this, we have done more receiving in six months than we did in the year before. Dr. Glass is compassionate and logical in her presentation. I truly appreciated her approach to this subject. It seems like so often, the betrayed partner is victimized by what they should or should not have done. Not so in ""NOT Just Friends"".I highly recommend this if you feel like you are going completely insane. Take a breather, read it over, and I guarantee you will see yourself and your relationship in its pages."
5,I highly recommend this book,"I highly recommend this book to anyone in a relationship. It does a great job of explaining how a platonic relationship can turn into an ""emotional affair"" which will likely lead to a physical relationship. It definitely forewarns you of what can happen even if you truly belief your spouse/partner would never stray. Wish this was required reading for engaged couples. We are all sinners striving to be saints."
5,An excellent book,"I found this book excellent. It was very easy to read and had a lot of wonderful information. Many examples of different types of infidelity were described in a clear and concise manner. If you have been involved with an extramarital affair, this is one book you should read. Even though it sounds counter intuitive, even people that are happily married can benefit from reading this book. After all, as the book explains, the majority of affairs that happen involve couples that are happily married."
5,Helpful,A Great book in difficult times. Helps you reach new levels of talking and understanding. Which helps in the healing process.
5,Insightful and Right On!,"This book is based on 20 years of research. With each chapter I was able to find helpful advice and insight that led me to understand how this could happen in even a happy marriage, plus it helped me to deal with and discuss my trauma in a controlled, appropriate manner. It also helped me to understand the pain that my ""unfaithful partner"" is going through. I would highly recommend this book to anyone whose spouse had an affair, especially with a co-worker. Affairs at work seem to be an epidemic in this country. Beware if he/she says, ""Don't worry, we're Just Friends."" NOT!"
5,DON'T BLAME THE VICTIM,"I readIs He Cheating? : Crack the cheat code and find out RIGHT NOW if he is cheating or not, why he cheats, what you need to do next. Why does he do that? (Why We Broke Up)and Not Just Friends in the same week, and found them both to be extremely helpful in understanding not only what happens before, during and after an affair, but how to get through it. Although Not Just Friends was very useful in this respect, I did feel like the author expected the betrayed party to accept as much responsibility for the affair as the person who committed the infidelity. I just couldn't stomach that. I foundIs He Cheating? : Crack the cheat code and find out RIGHT NOW if he is cheating or not, why he cheats, what you need to do next. Why does he do that? (Why We Broke Up)to be much more supportive, which was frankly, exactly what I needed."
5,Awesome live performer!,"I saw Terri at Uncle Calvins in Dallas Texas and she ignited the audience! She is everbodys daughter, sister and cool friend. She really brings the crowd to her. Very original artist, I can't wait to see her at the Grammys!"
4,vaporisateur?,"The bottle says ""vaporisateur"" which I think means that the spray comes out in a more fine mist than the last bottle I had, which didn't say ""vaporisateur"" on it. Seems like it takes more sprays to do the same job, not sure I like it as much as a regular spray."
1,Bland bland bland,"Ms. Basinger has chosen to write about inly the most famous of the silent stars -- Swanson, Pickford, Valentino, etc. -- because, she claims, they are the most interesting. Well, for the sake of her publisher they are (sales strategy), but not for the reading public, most of whom have already heard all about these people ad nauseam. Top it off with her sickening, oh-isn't-all-so-wonderful tone,and you've got one big boring book. Avoid this pandering mush at all costs! NOT a good holiday gift!"
4,"Good, But Not Complete","I watched this series every week on the Discovery Channel and enjoyed it very much, although I disagree with some of its findings. If a thought-provoking (though at times controversial) set of documentaries on the Bible is your cup of tea, then this box is for you.I would give this set 5 stars, if it weren't for the fact that there was space on these discs for two more programs in the series. Discs 1 and 3 contain only three episodes, while disc 2 has four. The program ""Who Was Moses?"" would have fit rather nicely on the first DVD about the Old Testament. And if the episode on the second disc called ""The Real Disciples"" had been placed on the third disc, titled ""Mysteries of the Apostles"", there would have been room on disc 2 for perhaps the best documentary of the entire series, ""Mary, the Mother of Jesus"". I think the Discovery Channel and the BBC dropped the ball a bit on this set but, overall, it is still worth the purchase."
2,"FICTIONAL, BIASED, NOT GOOD...","Yuck! It would be so nice to see a balanced perspective. It's not apparent in any of the series out there on cable tv that they even try to get other opinions. This one especially. I trust and believe the Bible is accurate. This series does not. Buy ""The Stones Cry Out"" DVD from World of the Bible Ministries and ""The Second Great Battle of Jericho"" by The Associates for Biblical Research. Then you will get another perspective.Haven't those in the media ever heard of The Near East Archaeological Society, The Associates for Biblical Research, The Institute for Biblical Archaeology, World of the Bible Ministries? Here is a list people that unfortunately many in the media forget about.Dr. Bryant WoodDr. Edwin Yamauchi (infrequent guest)Dr. Gary ByersDr. Bob Smith (from Florida)Dr. Charles AlingDr. Clyde BillingtonDr. Michael WiseDr. William SheaMr. Gordon FranzDr Randall Price etc;"
4,strong spicy chai!,"I bought two products. One was Tazo Chai tea, another was this Celestial Chai tea.Tazo one has more strong black tea flavour, this one has more spicy flavour.The reason why I gave only 4 stars is that I prefer black tea flavour of Tazo.If you want strong spicy chai tea, you should choose this one.And each bag wasn't packaged in some paper or anything, so I couldn't carry a tea bag around.but if you drink tea at only home, this is not a problem.Good: strong spicy flavour, inexpensiveBad: Package"
5,Excellent replacement for caffeinated version,"This tastes extremely similar, if note exactly the same, as the regular version of Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai Tea, which has caffeine in it.Delicious!I bought it in bulk, and am enjoying 1-3 cups per day."
5,My favorite!,"Groceries in my are stopped carrying this tea, but I love the chai, and needed decaf for those afternoon cups of tea. I think this has the best flavor of all the chais out there, and I've been testing a lot."
4,Really good!,Aromatic and delicous. I'm going to ice it and add milk for a refreshing drink. Am going to order more.
5,love this tea,"I make it in the microwave using skim milk (no water). Not exactly traditional, but really good!"
3,"""los ricos tambien"" editan!","The picture quality is as good as it could be for having been produced in the late 70's. The trouble with the older novelas is that they are redubbing the suspense music fans have come to identify with the novelas. It is obvious to anyone that this is done for royalty reasons, but the new music is just cheap and dreadful. I quite don't understand the royalty factor since you could still hear the old music underneath if you lend a close ear and in their attempt to drown it out, they distort the actors' lines at times. Like all other new to DVD novelas, it is severely edited. Though fans are well familiar with the storylines, the editing is a bit extreme. But I digress, and fans will still buy these. I did! I love amazon to death but there are some retail outlets where you can get these same versions for cheaper."
3,RE: LOS RICOS TAMBIEN LLORAN,I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS WAS NOT AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE THE STORY WOULD HAVE MADE MORE SENSE TO ME. WHO THE HECK EDITED THIS AND IS THERE ANY WAY TO STOP THEM FROM CHOPPING UP THESE STORIES. THEY REPRESENT MY CULTURE AND THEY NEED TO BE TOLD IN THIER ENTIRETY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. SO SAD.
2,About Los Ricos tambien lloran,"Los Ricos tambien lloran is very boring , goes and back in the same think over and over againI bought it because of the actress , that I like very much , but the developing of the novela I didnt like it at all"
3,TOO MANY CUTS,"I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. WHILE I ENJOYED THE NOVELA, BUT IT WAS EXTREMEMLY CUT AND THEREFORE, I MISSED MANY SCENES THAT I HAD SO ENJOYED DURING THE ORIGINAL AIRING. IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE NOVELA, YOU MAY BE A BIT CONFUSED BECAUSE OF SO MANY SCENES BEING CUT AND NOT ALLOWING SMOOTH TRANSITION. OVERALL, I CAN RATE IT 3 STARS."
4,Beginners essential book,"There are three books I recommend to all eager students of wine: Kevin Zraly's ""Windows on the World Wine School""; Karen MacNeil's ""Wine Bible"" and Jancis Robinson's ""How to Taste"". Jancis's book is a fun guide to learning the most important part of wine, the taste. Knowing how to taste and compare wine makes it so much fun. Even if you don't do all of the exercises, you will learn a lot and enjoy wine more."
3,me likey,i thought it was a good beginners book. it had plenty of detail about wine (and everything that goes into producing it) without encumbering a neophyte (such as myself)
4,Great Start,"I like my wine but wanted to go deeper into understanding what I tasting or enjoying and also why. The question was where to start. I was very lucky, this book was a great start. The first part will teach you how to use your taste buds,and give you a foundation for tasting, then teach you about the grape and the wine. Also the difference in country and regions. I went from there to Kevin Zraly's Windows On The World Complete Wine Course. Jancis's book prepared me well for this second wine book by Kevin. I hope to read Jancis's book again when I finish Kevin's book and I believe I will get much more out of it. Also she write for us common folks."
4,Excellent introduction to the world of wine,"This was an informative and pleasant read that helped me get started on understanding different wine varieties. Robinson goes over the basics of tasting and identifying different wines. She has sections on the major grape varieties and wine producing regions. The book is well-illustrated with a number of photographs. I am definitely hanging onto this one and referring to it from time to time. At this point I have no plans to become a connoisseur, but, thanks to this book, I do have a better understanding and appreciation of wine, and that, ladies and gents, heightens the enjoyment, does it not? If it is your goal to learn a bit about wines in order to improve your enjoyment of them and your understanding of what makes a good wine, then you will not be disappointed."
5,Dacne with a Stranger,"Beautifully rendered, superbly acted film recreates events leading up to one of England's most famous crimes of passion. Newell painstakingly revives the look and feel of 1950's London, using this sordid affair to examine the ingrained class differences that doomed the couple from the start. Richardson, Everett, and Holm are marvels to watch, and the film's shattering climax is worth waiting for. Catch this chilling romantic thriller."
1,Too late for me but you can still save yourself,"If you are running a older ver of windows then you may be ok. If you are running Win 7 It's not going to happen. Genearly Vista drivers will work with win 7 in this case, not so much. I bought this used on EBAY thinking I got a steal. Insted I was robbed by Buffalo's lack of driver support. As I said, it's to late for me but you can still save yourself. Don't buy it!!!"
2,"Ok, but Interferes w/ Speakers","I previously had a Hawking Technology card that was awesome... except for the fact that it lived a short life of two years. This card does not pick up signals as well, but the internet speed doesn't seem faltered by the weaker signal. However, whenever it's enabled, it SERIOUSLY intereferes w/ my computer speakers. No more listening to music saved on the computer while on the internet. Even if I'm not listening to music, there will be ""fuzzy"" speaker sounds if I leave it enabled (irregardless of speaker type). You can probably find a better internet card than this one."
2,slip on and slip off,"When my daughter outgrew the socks she wore for the first few months, I ordered Trumpettes based on other mothers' recommendations. Alas, they did not work as well for us as for our friends. The only way I found to keep them on her feet is to cuff them, but they were clearly not designed to be cuffed; the inside is unfinished looking, especially the dots. (Also, this is not a complaint but just an FYI: there is one striped and one dotted sock in each color. That was not clear from the picture since only one of each color is shown. If it is important to you to have matched pairs, you'll have to choose a different design!)"
4,Amazing Reiner,"Have no reservations about the Scheherazade on this disc. Reiner's recording of this with the CSO is the recording by which all others are judged; it alone is worth the price of this disc. That said, I'd recommend buying this recording of it on a different disc, because of the Russian Easter Overture. I don't like Stokowsky's interpretation. Everything about it (tempos, dynamics, etc) sounds grossly overdone, like a crude joke. And why did he have the trombone solo doubled? The excerpts from Tsar Sultan are acceptable, but nothing to write home about."
5,Most Comprehensive English-Spanish Language Book I've Seen,"From a Spanish language freak of over 15 years, with experience speaking/learning spanish in:Cuba/Spain/Mexico/Guatemala/Costa Rica/Peru/Argentina/Chile/U.S.A. I can attest that this is easily the best book I've found to date. My copy is getting too ratty to be useful. Only problem is that a lot of the new, technology related language is not included."
2,Not as good as the ADV,"I had high expectation from this book. However, after reading the first couple of chapters, I'm disappointed. This book, in a lot of parts, repeats what other books say, in particular ""Managing the Professional Service Firm"". If you read Maister's book before, you will be disappointed."
1,Full of Cliches,"I was very disappointed by the book. Not only is it full of cliches, but some of the advice is actually bad. Like buying a billboard to celebrate an employee's performance? In a professional services firm???"
1,DON'T BUY THE KINDLE VERSION!,"I can't actually judge the book content itself, but the Kindle Version I bought is absolutely AWFUL, packed with missing words and misspellings. Just terrible!"
4,You will eventually need this book as you get promoted,"I found this book thanks to a friend who suggested me how to manage a group of geeks that were way beyond my technical skills.Specially in professional service firms this is very likely to happen, as you climb up the corporate ladder, you get more manager and less technical. So this book will help you to manage your team, respect and use their skills and gain their respect and loyalty"
2,A little disappointed,"I suppose I was hoping for more information than this book gives. It is very basic in the information on chakras, gives even less information on Reiki and the chakras. Gives more information on the chakras and balancing them without Reiki than it does with Reiki.Better books on chakras out there. Was disappointed on the whole."
3,Cute but a little long for a 3 year old,"I purchased this book because my daughter's name is Ellie. It's a little long for a 3-year-old's attention span, but I read it superfast which she likes. I think it drags a little though."
4,Love the Ellie books,I love this book it is so much fun reading it and watching Ellie try to pick out her dress. The little girls in my day care laugh at how Ellie is so animated. All little girls can relate to Ellie because each morning they wake up and try to decide what to wear they see a little of Ellie in them.
5,BOOK -- ELLIE: THE PERFECT DRESS FOR ME,JUST WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR THE OCCASION -- PURCHASED TWO. GREAT GIFTS FOR THE LITTLE ONES IN YOUR LIFE.
2,strange,"I read this book for a school project, the reveiws and summaries suggested that the book would be funny and entertaining but I and my classmates found it to be disturbing and we regret reading it. We honestly feel for the main character, but I think someone should give you a warning before reading this book, it is very explict. The book goes into detail about the sexual abuse the main character goes through, we don't feel the book is worth the time is takes to read it."
3,Wonderful Eleanor! So-So Book.,"I read this book in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. It was engrossing and I fell in love with Eleanor. But when I finished I was disappointed. Things were not clarified to the point that an analitical mind could sort it out. Eleanor's delusions vs. reality were never separated enough that the reader had a firm grasp of what Eleanor's reality really was. A plus for the book is that Eleanor's character has a lot of depth, and I didn't regret getting to know her."
1,"Let down, expected more","After reading reviews of Eleanor Rushing, I at least expected an entertaining book. What I found was an underdeveloped tale of an unbelievable, one-sided love affair. The plot did not flow well and rather than being amused by Eleanor's ""charm"" I was irritated by her actions that seemed to come out of nowhere. I was at least hoping for a flavorful account of New Orleans, since that is where the story takes place, but even the use of the city's institutions and landmarks detracted rather than enhanced the story."
5,STILL A GREAT SERIES,THIS GREAT ADVENTURE SERIES ABOUT ENGLAND'S MOST FAMOUS HIGHWAYMAN IS AS EXCITING AND FUN-FILLED AS WHEN IT WAS SHOWN FROM 1979 - 1982
3,Interesting but drawn out,"Leo Tolstoy is brilliant at expressing and delving to the core of human emotions, his insight into both males and females emotions is exceptional. The different stages of love and the beauty of death. Written in the 1800's and still prevalent today.I found the stories to linger too long on emotions as the pace grew slower and slower, almost to an irritating halt.An interesting read, although for the reader with a bit of patience."
1,Terrible translation,"I am currently reading ""The Death of Ivan Ilych"" by another translator and it is a remarkable and moving story. However,the translation that is offered in this edition was so awkward that I found it unreadable. The purchase of this edition was a waste of money and it's now sitting on my bookshelf unread. I recommend the translation by Constance Garnett. I hope that Pevar and Volokhonsky (transaltors of War and Peace and Anna Karenina) will release translations of Tolstoy's shorter works. Their translations are my favorites."
5,excelente tematica,"la novela es corta y tiene una tematica excitante y a veces escalofriante, la perspectiva de la muerte cercana a una edad temprana. el autor estuvo durante los ultimos anos de su vida casi paralizado de temor por la muerte y la vejez, tanto es asi que murio como si estuviese huyendo de ella. esta pequena novela refleja sus miedos y angustias, ya que presenta a un hombre sano que contrae una enfermedad y que sabe que su fin esta cerca y no se resigna a morir como debemos morir todos los seres humanos, con dignidad .... LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"
1,"Interesting, But That's About It","I wasn't too impressed about this book as many other reviewers were. The only positive thing I can say about this book is for its style. Obviously, Leo Tolstoy is well-known for his novel epics, WAR AND PEACE, and ANNA KARENINA, and also for his short stories (some which I've read and enjoyed). But from reading this book I didn't really see that brilliant storyteller. The book is more like a biography about a fictional character and his death than an actual story. Of course we as the reader get the universal ideas of death (such as ""better him than me"" attitude, ""Why do i deserve to die this way God?"" etc.), and as someone who has recently overcome the lost of a family member, I can relate. But to me I found this book boring and pointless to read (thank goodness it was a NOVELLA!). I don't really see how other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I mean it was a well-written book and all, but nothing worth bragging about, and it's definitely NOT Tolstoy's best work."
3,I ordered this book?,"I don't remember even ordering this book, never mind recieving it, but in foresight I will be needing it for up and coming class schedule. So I will look around (there isn't much to look around through. It's all books!) and if I find this book I will withdraw this review and post a positive one. If not I will write back asking to recieve this book or a cancelation notice and a refund. Sorry, I probably have it, but thanks for the reminder e-mail."
4,Tolstoy Introduction,"I've not read any other works by Tolstoy, but I think these stories provide a good example of his style, or at least some of what he is capable of and they are interesting reads, for the most part."
2,Contents Disappointment,"I would publish this without a rating if Amazon would let me. This is not actually a review.I have not actually gotten around to reading any of this volume yet. I purchased it because of a desire to read ""The Raid."" But that story is not actually in the book, despite the title. I'll get around to reading what is actually in the book some day, but I wish the publisher would accurately label its product. Moreover, I wish I could purchase a volume that actually includes ""The Raid."""
5,Thought about it all winter.,"I read the hardback version of this story last summer. It's the kind of tale that stays with you...I found myself continuing to thing about the author, the story, even the darn boat as the winter winds blew. I'm happy to hear there's a paperback version, with some photos, etc. Looks like I already know what I'll read...again...from my hammock this spring."
3,Cork boat or ship of state?,"In general, I enjoyed this book. Designing and building a boat from bottle corks is quite an accomplishment, even with an author who is more than slightly self-absorbed.I believe that this work would have been much better served as a light-hearted and humorous discourse; as the author's political ranting contributed nothing to the content and in my opinion served to diminish the overall content. The boat was constructed on a whimsy and by taking advantage of an opportunity. And not, so near as I can tell, as a political statement.Raised in the elitist environment of academics and political activism, the author is unfortunately unable to separate either himself or his boat from such. With the resulting narrow focus and rigid weltschauung, even a very good writer will too often end up sounding both condescending and cavalier. When the author launches his next monograph he might want to consider leaving his politics on the dock."
4,Either you'll get it or you won't.,"If you do not understand why anyone would leave a high paying, high profile job writing speeches for a person whom most would agree was the most powerful person in the world to go build a boat, then you should not read this book. You will not get it. If the corporate ladder holds no glory for you, then this is your book.I give the author a lot of credit for having the nerve to do what most money hungry Americans would never understand. Pollack had a dream to build a boat of corks since he was a little boy. Now at the age of 34 he had decided to follow his dream, a crazy idea at best. Nevertheless, he chose to follow his dream. I wish I had his guts.I highly recommend this to anyone that has ever had a crazy dream and is too scared to go for it. Pollack should be an inspiration to us all. Thankfully, he is also a witty and interesting writer. jay."
4,"Fun read, facinating journey",I really enjoyed this book. It was great to hear about how the author (and his family & friends) came up with the idea and then worked through many challenges to finally build & launch the boat and then take advantage of an offer to sail it in Portugal.
4,entertaining,"I found this an entertaining book, read while traveling and on vacation. I will admit to being a kook about things like this, but it was an enjoyable read about someone excercising their passion and it becoming an adventure."
4,prognosis is not good,"Venice is a city with a glorious history but a very uncertain future. How to even have a future is the subject of this book. It presents a nontechnical description of the problem. Well, multiple problems. One is that buildings continue to subside into the silt. Another is the erosion of the wetlands around Venice. These act as a buffer against storms. Americans will note the resemblence to New Orleans. But the main problem is still hypothetical, though becoming less so with each additional year. Global warming. If sea levels rise by at least 8cm, or as much as 90cm, then we have a sticky wicket.Various solutions are explored in the book. Barriers help reduce flooding. But the cost can be enormous if sea levels rise and storms worsen in frequency and intensity. Overall, the book cannot be read with optimism."
3,Research needs,I am a doctoral student in psychology hence the nature/needs of mine in relations to this book. Results quoted were mostly on a superficial level and for my needs insufficient.
4,Timeless Tales review,"By TT reviewer John RichardRichard Clifford, a deaf boy living on a farm with his mother, arrives home after a motorcycle ride.THE SILENT SCREAM is a fast read, blazing through the pages with the speed of a falcon in a dive. The main character, Tom Casey, and his wife are in a sense, the modern version of Nick and Nora Charles, only with their own unique bent. Tom's disfigurement for example only adds to his likeableness. Plus he's caring and compassionate, and almost non-violent, which are very rare elements in the modern PI story. The only downside though, is the ending, which slowed after the climax, though thirty pages remained! Despite this minor shortcoming, the novel is an amazing read, going back to the age where the PI often referred to his mental skills, got along well with the police, and often assisted them in the investigations. A delightful read for any mystery lover, though especially for those who miss the golden age of the thinking PI."
3,Candle Magick is VERY REAL,"Saying a prayer and lighting a candle after charging it with your intent is not childish nor is it ineffective tomfoolery. The book is only 64 pages long and if you want a longer, more detailed book with more info and more spells to cast, look up ""candle magick"". Patricia Telesco and others have fabulous books on this wonderful phenomenon.When my husband went to the bank to get a mortgage on our first condo, I cast a candle spell for three nights before his appointment. When he called me afterwards, we'd been approved for a $100k mortgage, which was above what we thought we could get. Seeing is believing! Don't believe a thing about candle magick until you road test its principles for yourself!!!"
5,love it!,"i got this book along with all Slyvia Brownes other books, and i use it dailey i love it its great!1"
2,Okay book,"This is not a necessity for devout fans of Sylvia Browne. The pictures are nice and it is quite short. The main message I got out of it is that ""they"" can see us better by candlelight."
3,disappointing,"I was expecting candle rituals. This is more like a ""chicken soup"" book with think good thoughts and all of that. Its very nice, pretty pictures, but not what I expected at all. Too expensive as well."
3,Disappointing,I love Sylvia Brown but this was disappointing and was such a small book. She is better than this.
2,Disappointed,"Of all the books I have read from Sylvia Browne, I liked thisone the least. I thought it would be more stories with herwittiness and prayers to say with ""a candle lit"" thrown inhere and there."
3,Not quite an expose,"Clearly, DeLorean is one of the more intriguing figures of the post-War auto industry. At this point, he's at the top of the game and quite in love with himself. The book provides a great backboard for someone trying to understand his later foibles."
2,Most annoying screech ever,"My small (24 pound) dog loves these talking animals. I've bought him each one of them. He carries them around the house with him, sleeps with them in his dog bed, amuses himself with them, and makes them talk sometimes - for ten minutes in a row. He does eventually destroy most of them, pulling the ears off the parrot, destroying the sound mechanism inside, ripping some of them apart. They last him one to several months. His favorite of them all seems to have been the pup from Multipet - not pretty much destroyed after three weeks. They are his pets. But this monkey, though it's absolutely adorable, more adorable than the chimp, has the most annoying screeching sound I've ever heard. I haven't given it to him because I don't want to hear that awful screech all day. Something to be concerned about. The sounds the other Multipets make are tolerable, or even cute. Nothing cute about the screeching monkey sounds."
5,It's one of my dog's FAVORITES!,"My Frenchie LOVES her monkey! I'm glad I bought this toy -- it's very well made, a good size for her to carry, and is extremely entertaining...RECOMMENDED!!"
2,The sound is more like screaming than cute monkey sounds.,"It scared my dog, it is hard and the sound is more like a shriek than a cute monkey sound. Not great for small dogs."
2,Disappointment...,"I enjoy reading food narratives and childhood accounts of growing up in foreign countries; however, this book is quite a disappointment after reading the summary above. The writing isn't great, the descriptions certainly don't transport you to Tuscany, and despite the title, I wouldn't say there is an emphasis on food. If you were related to Patrizia, you mind find it an interesting read, but I've found myself skimming through it, searching for compelling passages, of which there are few."
4,Urban Yoga & Pilates Mat,"I really like this mat. It's thick, rolls out nicely and is a breeze to clean.(Found it for way less where I live) What I dislike about it is that it is kind of soft. Practicing the asanas on this mat can be a bit tricky. The mat is very plush that you sink in a bit while doing the standing poses, not really safe for when you really need your balance. This is great for those poses where you are on your back like in Pilates and/or need to work the spine. Otherwise a good mat overall."
3,Great for regular paper,"This perforating blade has been a great addition to our crafting and promo kit at work. We are able to perforate coupons to mail out in small amounts now, which has been a wonderful way to expand our fun marketing campaigns. However, if you are planning on using paper that is heavier than 20lbs, you are wasting your time with this blade. It will just create a cut."
3,Tiresome,"Save yourself cramps and frustration. The squirt bottle for the cleaner is pathetic. Your fingers will be in pain before your filter is clean. On top of that, the 'drip on' method of oiling the filter does not work well. It takes forever for the oil to spread throughout the filter (many hours).When I do this again, I'll just buy bulk cleaner and the aerosol oiler."
3,Wish would have got the aerosol,This is what it is. A cleaning kit for AFE filters. It cleans it and re-oils the filter. It is however a squeeze bottle which makes it almost impossible to not over-oil the filter.
3,it ok if u dont mind. a lil work,Its ok they cold have made it a lil better an eazy to use u just have to know what u doing an dont over use the product
4,"Give it a try, you'll like it","I bought this book because of the favorable review by Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and The Economist. I found the book interesting on many levels and annoying on a few others. The main annoyance was with the general tone of the book. The first part of the book is a homage to many of the people that Hindery has known in the business. It almost sounds solicitous. However, the book recovers from this with a great treatment of how to do deals and insight into how some of the deals he was a part of transpired. I finished the reading of this book with the feeling that while some of the book was a waste, the book as a whole was not a waste of time. Therefore I rate it with 4 stars and encourage any aspiring dealmaker to go and negotiate a good price on the book and learn. The 10 rules for negotiating a deal are excellent."
2,Excellent Godard clips - buy 'Vivre Sa Vie' instead.,"the heroine's search for a personal identity takes the form of striking between opposites - girl/boy, mother/father, film/reality, country/city, Judaism/Christianity, conformity/individuality. This is a rites-of-passage movie as Portrait of the Filmmaker as a Young Woman, with Hanna taking inspiration from the like-sounding Anna in 'Vivre Sa Vie' (and who was also inspired by a great film), while storing up, Wordsworth-like, artistic inspiration from Godard. Pool's hackneyed filmmaking puts Godard's masterpiece in relief, and makes it seem even more miraculous."
3,It's alright.,"I've had it for six months, it works well for a portable CD player. Skip free, and you can walk around with it, but it's not convinient when jogging, doesn't work as well."
2,It just stopped working,"I have had this player for approx 4 months, I was in love. Then 2 days ago it just stopped working. I am not really sure what happened. I now put in a cd and the player just clicks, but, I really did like it. I now have a rather large - round radio. It does nothing else. So Sad. The reason I give it two stars is because the radio is very good and it at least still works. I DON'T REALLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS ITEM."
3,great sounds with the 3d,i brought this walkman from a friend at a low price but iam looking for the external battery case the came when he brought it can you please help me find one thank you
2,not happy,"the sox i got were not worth the money i paid for them , if they were my feet would not be getting cold when i wear them ."
5,No more stinky feet!,Bought these for my husband to take on a fishing trip. They worked great for him on the trip and now he wears them to work with leather boots. He no longer has stinky feet after a 12 hour workday. Great socks!
3,Warm but not the snuggest,"These socks served the purpose for what I needed, which was to keep my toes warm while I hobbled around in an ortho healing boot but they're not very soft and they do not fit my woman's size 8 foot like a sock. It has a kind of shapeless feel to it. And their not very soft to the touch either. Maybe this is why they were such a good bargain?"
2,Keeps feet warm but ...,"Kept my feet warm but the bottom of it had too much room for my feet socks were not snug or comfortable and the crew top kept slipping . My feet slipped in the socks a lot which can cause blisters plus with the sweat that was left …not good … not going to buy these again ….I'm gonna stick with Nike branded socks (which are dry-fit) , and get a warmer lined /gore-tex boot to wear while I'm at work."
5,Durable work socks,"My husband GOES THROUGH some socks. We have bought all different kinds, from expensive ones like these to much cheaper ones. Most of the thinner cotton socks get holes in them within a couple of months; however, I got him some of these about two Christmases ago, and not one pair has holes yet. We have been very pleased with the functionality and durability of these socks. They work well in his steel-toed boots."
3,Wish they did not bunch up,"These socks are OK, but not as good as similar ones I have purchased from REI for example. For some reason, they slide dowm my ankle a bit and bunch up on the bottom of my feet."
3,Wigwan at Work Socks,"I have been trying to find a good warm wool blend sock (reasonably priced) to wear around the house during the winter. This is my fifth set and I still can't find the perfect sock. Either too expensive, the sock will not stay up or will not keep my feet warm. Maybe my standards are too high. I will keep looking."
4,Not very stretchy.,Very comfortable and warm but not as stretchy and formfitting as my other Wigwam socks. They tend to bunch up a bit inside my shoes.
1,Are these really Wigwam?,"I purchased these socks along with some of the comfort hikers and another pair of wigwam hiking socks. All were size Large, shoe size 9-12. For some reason, these don't fit well at all. They seem much too short for the size advertised. The heel seems to work its way up under my foot and cause more uncomfort. They cause my feet to sweat/overheat in the same situations the Comfort Hiking socks are brilliant in. After one day of wear, they already look torn up on the outside.It makes me wonder if these socks really are made by the same Wigwam. They are far inferior to the other wigwam socks I've had. If I can return them, I will be. I've only used one of the pairs, but have zero desire to put another pair of these socks on again. It was VERY refreshing to take them off.The only advice I can give is: bypass this style and go with the Comfort Hikers. Even for every day work wear."
2,They just don't stay put,"These socks constantly sag and slide down my foot, getting bunched up at my toes. I ordered size L (shoe size 9-12), and I wear shoe size 10.5, so this should not be happening."
4,good socks,These are some great socks for cold winter days. I have used them both by themselves and doubled up with another pair. Both ways keep my feet warm and dry. If I was in a colder zone I might opt for heavier socks though. These are great for cold days but just a little light for sub-zero temps.
3,Very warm,"These socks are very warm, but they don't stay up .... Oh how I hate when your walking along and your sock is down in your boot...not a good thing."
3,Warm and dry but bunch up at the toes,"I really want to like Wigwam and I do think they make a quality product but...these wool socks and there ""At Work"" cotton socks both suffer from the same problem; they bunch up in the foot-bed. Never noticed how much this annoyed me till I tried a pair of SmartWool socks. The Wigwam's start bunching up within moments of putting them on either with house slippers or with shoes.I'm switching teams!"
5,great,I have to turn the foot warmer off on any vehicle I drive feet are to warm...great socks and a good price would buy again shipped fast
4,socks,loved these socks. gave them to myself best gift I have received so far this year thank you selfe. yep
3,not for me,"Looking for new more durable socks, sick of ""cheap"" Socks I have to replace every few months, that keep going up in price. After reading and learning, I decided to give Wigwam a try. I bought these and the Wigwam Men's At Work DuraSole. I got them both today.I tried both socks on and they both feel comfortable, but I am VERY sensitive to wool, and these are just a little too scratchy, so I prefer the no wool DuraSole.I wear a 10 1/2 to 11 size boot, and they fit fine. Gonna pass them to my roommate. If he every tells me anything more about them, I will update this."
1,Inaccurate and full of assumptions,"As someone who has read a lot of books and literature on Shivaji, I'm amazed how inacurrate some of the information is in this book. Several of the author's comments are pure hear-say or word-of-the mouth with little historical evidence.As I started reading the book, I very much appreciated the author's effort to present a different perspective how things may have been back in Shivaji's era but by the time I finished reading the book, I was very disappointed with the way data has been put forth.I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family."
1,unfaithful book & author guided by silly people & institute,"this is realy silly book that makes dark circle on great LORD CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ.author hearts intensions of people of india that treat shivaji not just king but lord.Reaserch on book is done in Bhandarkar institute,india.Author James Laine trapped between some silly people whose wrong information feeding & scychicness done big controversy & riots in India.there is no faithful reaserch & references behind that book.There is no need to keep it in bookshelf JUST THROWN IT IN DUSTBIN."
1,Disgusting hate book,"All of the reviews that praise this book are written by muslims. Big surprise! This is a disgusting and savage screed by a white supremacist and Hindu-hater. They demean and denigrate the character of the Chattrapati with a deliberate and malicious agenda of advocating the eventual mass-murder os Hindus. freedom of speech does not protect blatant hate-speech, even in a democracy. It was only right of the Sambhaji Brigade to challenge white supremacy. The only reason why white people and their muslim allies do this is because they see themselves as god's chosen race and no brown hindu person is allowed to realize his culture or his heritage, only the white man and a morality that is as white as the white man's skin."
1,"take my advice, pls don't waste your money, time or thoughts","I would not give single star to this book, but thats the lowest rate you can give. Completely inaccurate history of King Shivaji and his Legacy is written in this book. If your read archives of News papers in Maharashtra, India during the time period Lane was there to do incomplete and false ""research"" on this topic, you will understand how shallow his work was and how many anti-maratha Brahmins mis-leaded Lane about Life of King Shivaji.If you are interested in Unbiased life story of King Shivaji, please read ""Shivaji the Great by V.D. Katamble"". Or more simple, just read article about him on wikipedia. Its excellent source of information and its free."
1,Fiction not History,"Some of the remarks made by James Laine in this book, seem more like willful, calculated sensationalism than honest scholarship. Despite his apology which as of now he has practically retracted , there are certain issues that need both examination and comment. .."
3,Average,"Average would be the word to describe this book and such, it's a book one shouldn't go out to buy but borrow...(Though that aside, one has to point out that this book is certainly not for those die-hard ethnocentrists who are easily offended by a book that takes a differing perspective from the one they take)"
1,"A book with Primitive, tendentious arguments made using hand-picked one sided facts.","Controversies aside ; the book is low on intelligent arguments and is tendentious and biased towards its purported line of argument, and frankly a complete waste of time in general.James Laine is obviously not the brightest of authors.From the way the author makes half-cooked arguments without either examining the alternate explanations or understanding the complete history/environment of medieval India -- it is quiet apparent the author is not malicious - He is just an intellectually-retard."
1,Shivaji by James laine,"Imagine a Maratha Indian deconstructing Benjamin Franklin,this is what Mr Laine attempts to do,deconstruction of a Maratha and Indian hero whose whole background,life and importance are very remote from him, a middle American.I found the book insolent and presumptious,though the storm it attracted was for the wrong reasons,the book should be criticised and the authors motives questioned."
1,Imperialist Impertinence,"This book is an affront to post-colonial Indology, being a prime example of imperialist-colonial impertinence. A significant omission in the snide review of literature on Shivaji is that of the Dalit savant Babasaheb Ambedkar, most probably because the latter's civil and learned opinion would not suit the author's insidious designs to drive a wedge in the native population on the basis of caste. Ever wondered why this visionary man did not lead the Dalits to convert to either Christianity or Islam? Better if the James William Laine had first paid sufficient attention to papering over the cracks in his shoddy account, than pointing fingers at those who are not in a position to defend themselves against his 'below-the-belt' polemics."
1,Worst book ever,"i have read the book. it's the worst book ever. full of lies (by ""professor"" james laine). instead of writing on indian history, he should take a good look at his own country's history (how they wiped out native indians and treated africans as a slave and so on)"
5,Suit Yourself is Shelby's best!,"I have all of Shelby's CDs (that's right, all of them), so I know whereof I speak when I say that this latest CD ""Suit Yourself"" is a brilliant masterpiece. It seems to me that Shelby has truly found herself on this CD. Her voice is intimate and cool, very confident. All the songs are great so she wrote them all I think. In the intimate setting of a studio rehearsal session Shelby gives us a big raw glimpse into her soul. Every song is honest. The entire CD is a real winner. Hey, don't take my word for it. Buy this CD and see for yourself. BTW, I had a really rough time too finding this CD in a brick and mortor retail outlet. Thank god for Amazon. After searching all around for this CD in retail outlets to no avail, I did the wise, smart thing and ordered it online from Amazon.com. Shelby Lynne is a huge talent and she is finally hitting her stride, both as a songwriter and as a singer. This new CD is BRILLIANT."
2,Disappointing,"Wait...wait...wait...wait...wait...wait, and for nothing! Billy and John Grady would have been disappointed to know how poorly the book and their lives turned out. Cities of the Plain lacks sound and fury and still signifies nothing. We all deserve better."
2,A disappointing end to a notable trilogy,"What a letdown this book was! With such a strong start in ""All the Pretty Horses"" that continued a bit less strong in ""The Crossing,"" this third of the trilogy ends predictably and most unsatisfactorily. It's hard to believe the same author (and one of America's best) wrote ""Blood Meridian"" and ""The Orchard Keeper."" One can only hope Mr. McCarthy will recover from this mediocre effort and resume his true form as one of the preeminant authors in America today."
4,end of the last,"the third book of a very loose trilogy completes the story of John Gary Cole, the protagonist of the first book, All the Pretty Horses. More than the other two books, this one is a metaphor for a lost way of life, the terrible beauty of the American west of the past century."
5,Tragic yet ennobling,"Billy Parham and John Grady Cole, the protagonists of Cormac McCarthy's preceding books in his Border Trilogy, are friends working on the same ranch in 1950s Texas. The romantic John Grady falls in love with a Mexican prostitute and decides to marry her, against the wishes of her possessive pimp. The more pragmatic and jaded Billy feels compelled to aid the couple despite his misgivings. The stage is set for a tragedy.Prepare to have your heart broken. McCarthy presents expertly realized characters with honorable motives and good souls and sets them down in a nihilistic world where their best instincts only hasten their destruction. He depicts the best and the worst in human nature and though the good people suffer terribly, the end result is ennobling because their essential decency remains. This novel has a long, heartrending denouement that may have you wondering about the next homeless old man you see."
