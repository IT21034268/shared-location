1,Cheaply made filter breaks after only a few months--don't buy it,"I really wanted to like the Brita filter, I did. My sister has the pitcher system which she swears by. I like the idea of the on-tap filter and the space-saving convenience. But now that our third--third, mind you--filter system has exploded, I'm giving up.We tried this model, and the more recent one with the even more awkward and poorly designed dial-switch, which proved no more durable. Cheap construction, don't buy it."
2,Breaks easily,"The filter makes my water taste great. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't break so easily. I was washing a dish and accidentally knocked the little plastic aerator off. Water started spraying down and splashing everywhere. Upon closer inspection it seems like the aerator nozzle is just press fitted into the housing. Now the nozzle doesn't stay in place. The water filter works fine, but it's pretty useless if I can't do the dishes without getting water everywhere."
3,"great for a few months, then needs replacing","I've been using these tap filters for a couple of years and have noticed a significant decline in quality. They tend to start breaking around the 5th month of use, wherein an entire new faucet unit needs to be purchased. The filters are convenient enough, and I like the taste of the water, but having to purchase new filters and tap systems so often is a bit more of a hassle than I'd like."
4,Good but might fall off,"This is a great product but it can be very easily knocked off the faucet. Adapters are all rubber instead of metal with rubber washers, making a very non-rigid connection. I have no problems with leaks and the filtered pressure is adequate."
2,went bad before it should have,"I absolutely loved this product for about 8 months. Then the light indicator started to blink red at each use, even after brand new filters were put in. Then, about two months later it started leaking out of the side of the adapter. We tightened it and no luck. So we trashed it and went back to the faithful brita smart pitcher."
1,Cheap peice of garbage,"Installation was easy, just screw the thing on to your faucet and put the filter in.The first time I used it, I turned the water on and the unit blasts off my faucet and falls into the sink, spraying water everywhere. After several tries, the unit kept ending up in the sink or spraying water all over the kitchen. I tried tightening the faucet adapter and the threads became stripped. So I took that one back. The next one did the exact same thing.Apparently the genius engineers at Brita decided to put plastic threads on the faucet adapter. Guess what engineers? The plastic you chose is way too soft and the threads on the faucet adapter get stripped or just break away very easily.Don't waste your money on this. Go for the PUR faucet filter instead. It has metal threads and works better than the Brita."
3,Brita on tap,Seems to work fine but eventually the plastic threads wear out and will not stay attached to the faucet and has to be replaced (built-in obsolescence).
1,Brita on tap faucet water filter system(white),"This would get a better rating if the plastic screw-on adapters were made of metal, so now I must look to find a metal adapter because it keeps falling off, it is also worth mentioning that with metal, you've less likely to stripe the threads, to conclude, the unit is worthless because of a simple adapter, so buyer beware, as a former plumber, I know that these metal adapter are available just for this reaon, with the advent of filter and other add-on."
1,This is possibly the worst product I have ever purchased,"Just like everyone else, our filter does not tighten adequately and will not stay attached. It's done this since day 1. Infuriating!"
1,Unusable out of the box.,"My faucet required one of the included adaptors which fit the faucet nice and snug. However, the Brita unit itself does not fit its own adaptor. It will not tighten even minimally without the threads slipping. When tightened as much as possible without the threads slipping, the slightest bump or jiggle and even minimal water pressure detaches the unit from the faucet."
1,HATE THIS!!,We've only had this for three days and I've already taken it off. If it actually stays connected to the faucet then it sprays and leaks like crazy. Most of the time if just pops off when I turn the water on! I absolutely HATE this.
4,Good filter,"I have always purchased PUR faucet filters in the past. This design seems more sturdy and the 2 seperate settings when not being filtered is handy. If this thing holds up over time, I will not go back to PUR."
1,On my 3rd complete replacement set after 18 months,"I don't know what it is about this product, but it just does not hold up at all. Actually, I do know what it is: cheaply made.When it works, it works great. There is nothing like having fresh water at the tap without having to refill a pitcher every day. But it won't take long for you to realize that this device isn't made for the long term.Within months of owning small leaks start to occur around the device. Shortly after those appear, the leaks worsen and will actually run into the water you are wanting to filter.After spending over $100 on 3 replacements and how ever many replacement filters, I have learned my lesson the hard way on this product.You really do get what you pay for in this product."
4,Works well...BUT BUY A METAL FASTENER.,"I bought this filter because I was tired of having tons of plastic water bottles to recycle(not to mention the environmental effects of buying bottled water). Within 2 days the filter fell right off of the tap while in use, I re-fastened it and it kept falling off. Eventually the plastic threaded fastener became completely stripped and the filter would no longer fasten on at all. At this point I sent an angry email to Brita and began to dwell on 30.00 wasted(I'm a student..). BUT I decided to see if I could find a replacement fastener piece at the hardware store, I found a QUALITY metal one(2.00) that was the same size as the cheaply made plastic original. Put the filter back on using the new metal fastener and it hasn't leaked or fallen off since and it's been about 3 months. Long story short...IF YOU BUY THIS FILTER INVEST IN A 2 DOLLAR METAL THREADED FASTENER, WHICH ANY HARDWARE STORE HAS IN THE PLUMBING DEPARTMENT."
1,Frustrating!!!,My unit was only 6 months old when it started to leak like crazy. No matter what I did I was not able to control the leak. I am not buying a new filter system from Brita. Don't spend your money on this system.
3,"The filter cartridge works, but the LED indicator not!","The filter cartridge works and the water tastes fresh without odor. However, The LED indicator dies after six months. Now I just have to taste the water to judge whether the cartridge needs replacement or not."
1,lasts about two weeks,"the thing is junk. the first week it was awesome; easy to install, and the water came out clear and tasty. the second week it started leaking and while filtering the water, instead of having a steady stream coming out of the thing, it just dripped slowly. so slowly that it took 2.5 minutes to fill a glass with water. the thing sucks."
1,Brita Water Filter is horrible,"This is a horribly designed filter, constantly falls off the faucet, leaks, sprays. No matter how many times we screw it on or how tight we try to screw it to the faucet, it just won't stay on. Big waste of money."
2,Need big muscles to operate,"There are four of us in our house, and the fridge doesn't have room for a pitcher. So we invested in the Brita tap filtration. It worked great for the first few months. But then it started leaking/spraying water around the edges and the knob to switch from the filter to tap got really tough to turn, like impossible without hurting your fingers or straining. Because of that, people stopped turning it back to the regular tap water and the filter would quickly turn to red because water was only being run through the filter for all use.Currently looking into another filter system with better reviews."
3,its ok,I have used this system for many years. Recently I have had to replace the whole unit because the light that tells you when it is time to change filter stops working all together. You cannot replace the batteries in this unit so you have no choice but to replace the whole thing. When it works it is great.I have contacted the service department twice. I did receive coupons good for the next purchase. I was told by them that even thought the light doesnt work as long as the filter is not over 4 months old it is still filtering. I for one do not keep track of then i changed the filter so this causes a problem. They seem to be aware of this problem. This product is a good filter but the unit itself is having its problems
2,Maddeningly flawed,"Another example of a manufacturer taking a good product and slapping on cheap peripherals. This filter system is great in theory. The problem is the super cheap connectors which will fail almost at once, causing water to spray all over the kitchen. As if dripping cupboards aren't bad enough, the straight tap water will actually spray, shoot and dribble into the filtered stuff, contaminating it and defeating the purpose of the whole wretched experiment. It's hard to believe Britta would muddy its reputation by releasing a product so horribly designed. Buy this filter and run the risk of getting soaked, both figuratively and otherwise."
1,Don't buy it,The concept is great but the actual product is not. Every little bit it pops off or leaks. The plastic connector is light weight and easily damaged. I will take the pitcher over this thing any day. What a disappointment.
1,Complete deterioration in quality of tap-mount,"I am on my third Brita tap mount in 2 months. On the first, the indicator light stopped working even before the first filter change. The second, sent to me by the company as a replacement, didn't fit properly on the tap and kept falling off. The third, another purchase and a brand-new design, leaked copious amounts of water from the filter release button and from the filter vs. tap water toggle.I have used Brita tap-mounts for years. The previous tap-mount lasted several years and was replaced because its physical appearance started to deteriorate. Quality control has clearly declined and the new design is fatally flawed. My recommendation? Buy Pur."
1,A waste of money!,"I bought a Brita filter and am thoroughly disgusted with it. The flow of water through the filter is so piddling that it takes close to two minutes to fill a 1.5 liter bottle, and the filter system itself leaks and pops off the faucet anytime the water is turned up beyond a trickle.The water (when I COULD get water) did taste better, but between the spurting all over the kitchen and the fact that the filter kept popping off the faucet, it just plain wasn't worth it.Spare yourself the money: Get something that works. A Brita just isn't worth the aggravation."
4,brita,I wish the water came out in a single stream. other than that it seems just fine. this is a replacement because the faucet mount failed after several years of use.
1,Explosive filtration,"If only I could give this product zero stars...* vs. the Brita pitchers -- water doesn't taste as good.* vs. tap water -- tastes better* water pressure -- on filtration mode it's not too bad.* quality -- poor.* convenience of having a big lump on the end of your faucet: minimal.* ability of this product to stay ON the end of the faucet: poor. In a way this is the best feature of this product -- randomly it will just ""explode"" off with an exciting geyser of water as you're trying to do dishes, wash hands, fill ice cube trays, etc.AVOID this piece of junk."
1,Garbage,"I have a completely normal common faucet with the threads on the outside. This Brita filter's plastic threaded connector does not stay on the faucet more than a couple seconds, if at all, because of poor quality. It cross-threads when I try to attach it, or it doesn't attach at all. The connector is like a half a millimeter too loose. Frustrated that I'll have to take another user's advice and see if I can find a metal replacement connector. Customer service suggested I go to the hardware store. I don't recommend this poorly manufactured plastic product."
1,"Shoddy construction, soon leaks and breaks","This water filter works fine for a couple of weeks, but then the leaks start and pretty soon the filter simply falls off the faucet. The problem is that the threads are made of plastic, and they will not hold. Brita is counting on people to buy a new filter unit (not replacement filters, the filter unit itself) every 2-3 months. Count me out. The manufacturer has created and is selling low-quality junk."
1,Wish I could return it,"Very disappointing. I wish I had read the other reviews, as I would have passed this by. My old one, also a Brita, held up for 4 years, finally leaking. This one leaked within days. I tighten. It leaks. I use plumbers tape. It leaks. I put it back on several times a day. It leaks.I'm going back to the pitcher. Not worth it. Anyone need some filters I purchased at the same time?"
2,Repeatedly fell off my faucet,"I'm sure the filter did everything it was supposed to do in filtering out our water, but it fell off our faucet at least twice a day (sometimes we'd make it through a whole day and it would only fall off once or, on a rare occasion, not at all).Before anyone asks, it was installed correctly every time; it just couldn't handle the weight of the water from the faucet coming down on it when the pressure was on medium to full. Avoid this and get a pitcher instead."
1,got an old filter,Light wouldn't come on at all. Brita said it was manufactured 4 years ago and the sealed battery is only good for 2 th 5 years. Brita kindly replaced it.
1,POS!!!,This WOULD be a great product if the piece that attached (screws) to the faucet was metal and not plastic AND they gave you a better quality washer that isn't so thick. I got it to finally work after using a thinner washer without a screen. It's sad to see such a critical part of the product be so poorly designed.
1,Faulty product,"I purchased this item to replace a Tap Filtration System that had reached its use limitation. Same product, should have had the same reliability, but it did not. Whether the one I received is faulty as a result of a factory defect or any other means does not matter. I replaced my previous tap system with the new one. Two weeks later, the red light came on showing that the water was no longer being filtered. I replaced the filter. Again, same result. I thought maybe the filter was faulty, so I purchased a box of three filters. The most recent filter lasted less than a week before the red light came on. And, of course, since I truly believed that I wouldn't continue to have the problem, I didn't think to return the item within the 30 days. Now I find myself in the position of having to spend more money on replacing this one. Not happy with this product at all - and that's something I never thought I would say about Amazon deals."
1,Absolutely worthless,"Got one at BB&B; and it worked fine for about six weeks. If I wrote this review during that time, I would have given it four stars. My only complaint would have been the somewhat cumbersome switch between faucet water and the filter.That said, after about six weeks it no longer stays attached to the faucet. No matter how carefully and securely I reattach the unit to the faucet, it POPS off when I turn the water on, spraying me in the face in the process. Even using plumbing tape hasn't helped.I thought that maybe I just got a lousy unit, but after reading some of these reviews, there is apparently some kind of design flaw with this product. Save your money and buy a pitcher or a different brand of faucet filter that actually works."
1,2 threads....,".... that's what you get to hold the filter to your faucet. The mechanical design of this unit is completely insufficient. I'm a fan of Brita's filter products (AC does its job), but this is not a functional product. Don't buy it."
1,adapter problems,"Product works fine when attached. Adapter that comes with unit screws in to faucet fine . When filtration system is threaded on to adapter it will fall off into sink, with out any warning it;s loose. I would like to return product and additional filters I purchased. Poor design of threaded adapter."
1,At least their customer service is friendly,"You will be lucky indeed if this product lasts a year before either it starts leaking or the aereater breaks off. I made a big mistake when I thought I would save money by buying a multi pack of replacement filters. I've ended up purchasing two additional faucet mounts just to use up the filters. On the positive side, Customer Service is very cooperative about sending replacement parts when it breaks in less than a year."
1,Poor Design,"I had no problem installing this product and it worked great for a few hours. The water tasted great and it was easy to use. However, when the water filter got full of water it got heavy. As a result, the system repatedly fell off the faucet, even without being in use. The two treads on the plastic mounting cap are not sufficient to hold the heavy device. I am returning mine for a pitcher."
2,"Works great, until it's time to change the filter","I loved this system until it was time to change the filter. The indicator light never reset, even after attempting the manual reset procedure several times. A call to customer service got me a brand new system without asking for it, which makes me wonder how many other people had the same problem. Fabulous, until again, it was time to change the filter. Same problem with the new unit. They've offered to replace it again, but this time, I have to send my unit to them before they'll send the new, leaving me without my filtered water until the new one arrives. I think I will give the PUR system a whirl this time."
3,Brita faucet mount,"I've used these filters for 5 years and they are good. But this one was a lemon. The light did not work and it leaked. I had to return and exchange through the Brita company. Fortunately, they have incredibly helpful and responsive customer service reps."
3,Great with one small exception,"This is my second one after the first one wore out due to contamination and build up. Filters well. The only one complaint that I have with it which my only be applicable to my faucet is that the adapter is a little short. I needed to use Teflon tape to get a good seal. It tends to get loose and get leaky. I have to keep tightening it back up every once in a while to keep it from leaking. I think that the adapter may have changed slightly since I bought the first one a few years ago which didn't have any of these issues. But, otherwise, works well. However, that said, I would consider trying a PUR filter next time."
3,stuck plastic adapter,"I have a rather frustrating problem. I have enjoyed my Brita faucet filter units for many years. I have only had to buy new units when I moved cross country a few years ago. This one, unfortunately, is making me nuts. After replacing the washers, assemblies, and everything in the faucet handles to stop all the leaking, the Brita started leaking and acting up. I tried to simply remove the Brita, but the threads on the adaptor are stripped and I cannot get the darned thing off! I finally had to bust the unit off the adaptor. I think I will have to buy a PVC saw to saw the adaptor off! Help! Any suggestions? Next time I will use a metal adaptor/connector. I have never had this happen before."
1,It will work with help,"We've been pretty happy with this unit until it started ejecting itself from the faucet and spraying water everywhere. I looked at the reviews here to see what others were experiencing and find a fix. A quick trip to Home Depot and $3.00 fixed it. Visit the plumbing repair department and get a metal adapter (size on package is 15/16"" - 27x55/64"" - 27) to replace the cheap plastic and it has not come off in the last two weeks. We've not had the other issues that others have reported."
1,Showering in kitchen,"This is my third Brita in last one year. First two got the problem with indicator.However, this one is most annoying of all. It is showering in my kitchen. I have read for this particular issue in many reviews but never realize it could happen like this... I have to tighten the screw almost 2-3 times in a day. It's keep on coming off. It is the same tap and Filter unit type I am using since last five years however this one is coming off and again. Screw threads seem to be broken and water is sprinkling out. Last week I put my water bottle and went in the living room to check on our toddler, when I came back the whole kitchen was in a mess...I have to order for new one now as I have spare filters from Brita."
1,cheap filter kit that leaks - 3 new units in a row,this filter unit is cheap and leaks continually. Our first one with the old design with the sliding selector worked for 5 years. the new design with the twist type selector (only two selections-filtered or not) leaks back through the filter change button. this is not a good choice for faucet attached filtration although the results of good water are very satisfactory. We have changed the complete unit 3 times -- all the same.Advice: Don't buy this model.
2,Brita infaucet water filtration sytems,"A little over a year ago I purchased a Brita in faucet water filtration system. It did not last more than several weeks when the producted started seperating from the faucet and water was sprayed over everything. I contacted Brita and they replaced the unit and told me to use the metal connector instead of the plastic connector that came with the unit. I installed the unit, with the metal connector, on to the faucet and it worked well up until two weeks ago when it started leaking around the connector collar. I called Brita and they said that this could not be corrected. THe nice young lady offered to replace the unit but when she was told that this was a replacement unit the offer was withdrawn and substituted with a $5.00 gift certificate. Apparently the unit even though it was a little over a year old was out of warranty. Be careful because at this rate a glass of Brita water could end up costing a bundle."
1,Pure Junk do not buy,"I usually don't just trash a product, however after Brita discontinued a previous model that was great (owned two) they came out with this abomination. I thought there may have been an installation issue, however the unit is just a uncontrolled leak, from the fitting seams, from the unit, from the valve, etc. I just bought the pitcher model and deal with filling it up which is really no big deal, however do not waste you time or efforts on this absolute failure of a product."
2,Trickle trickle,"Worked great for about 3 weeks, then the flow got painfully slow. It was literally filling our water pitcher drop by drop by the time we hit 4 weeks. The unit itself seemed be fine, when I removed the filter and turned on the tap, the water sprayed out the appropriate hole fine. We were told by Brita customer service that the filter probably got loaded down with particles that it filtered out of the water, so we changed the filter after 1 month. Now about 2 weeks later, we're starting to see the slow down again and we don't have heavy tap water. The system is good, but the filters aren't and it would be way too expensive to have to replace them every month. I never had that problem with the pitcher!"
1,Broke after 9 months,"After 9 months of reasonably good service, the entire faucet apparatus started leaking and becamse unusable. The leaking water came out of the plastic seams on the sides of the device, to it definitely appears to be faulty construction.The most annoying thing is that I just bought some 3 replacement cartridges for the unit... which is now useless. What a waste of money. I'm looking for a better alternative."
4,Works well with a metal adaptor--do NOT use plastic ones,"I was pleased with this Brita filter system at first because I did not encounter any problems with the unit leaking or falling off, until my apartment management changed my kitchen faucet into a Delta 2012. The maintenance guy informed me that I needed to use a metal adaptor.The Brita filter package did come with two adapters, and one of them fits the faucet, but it lasted all but a couple of hours--only a few cups of water. It was leaking and also would fall off very easily. Finally, I took the plastic adaptor to a hardware store and asked if they had a metal one that size. I did find and buy one and now the system seems to work. The adaptor costs about 3 dollars (2.86 to be exact, where I bought it) and it's called an aerator adaptor, model number 420556 [ with O/M 1-5-50 after the model number on the package). The package says that it ""converts standard (15/16""-27) female faucet thread to standard (55/64-27) male thread."""
2,Brita leaks baddly in 3 months. Metal faucet plastic Brita,"The Brita Ultra faucet filter system was working great up until about the 3 month mark and then it just started to leak more and more and now it leaks horribly. I tried to investigate the problem and I think its simply this: The Brita faucet system is completely plastic and the faucet it attaches to is metal, so the plastic and rubber have just worn down and don't make a good seal. I have only removed the system about 3 times to clean it, as it was getting fairly dirty from regular use. I would like to make a suggestion to help you: Write the date on the filter because the light, that tells you when to put a new filter on, malfunctions regularly. I am still going to try and keep mine working and will contact the company for assistance. Hope this helps. Ohh, when I got mine it didn't fit my faucet but I told the company and they sent another attachment that did work."
2,Too Slow,"I bought this to replace the Brita pitcher, tiring of filling it every day. I just replaced it with the Brita Opti Max dispenser. I had no problem with the taste of the water, however the flow of the water was painfully slow and not cold. The thing with the pitcher was that the water came out ice cold, with this one you must use ice (every refill) and wait quite a bit of time. Much longer than the Opti Max. My water pressue is pretty good, so that wasn't the problem. I would not recommend this over the pitcher or Opti Max."
1,Can't believe it doesn't work at all,"From Day 1 water sprays out all over the place from the attachment to the faucet. There is no way to tighten it. If you try to tighten it so water doesn't leak out, it simply pops off the faucet because, as another reviewer said, there are not enough threads to create any kind of tight fit. What did the design engineers do when they designed this? What did they learn in engineering school? Did they go to engineering school?"
1,FALLS OFF the faucet!!,"FAULTY DESIGN!!! I followed all the instructions and after about 15 minutes, I turned on the faucet and the entire Brita filter simply POPPED OFF and fell into the sink! I reinstalled it, and again it popped off when I turned on the faucet! The problem is in the design. The adapter is too shallow...there's not enough threads...along with water pressure...it is impossible for the heavy filter to stay connected to the faucet...so it simply FALLS OFF the faucet! I'm so disappointed...how can Brita let this pass quality control??!!??"
1,Doesn't stay connected to faucet,The adapters are too shallow and don't allow for a good connection to the faucet.Under pressure the filter shoots off. Returned within 30 minutes.
2,It falls off,"I used this once, for about 5 minutes after I installed it, to get some water for iced tea. The water in my apartment is terrible, but after coming out it of the filter it tasted OK.The problem is that next time I turned the faucet on, the filter shot off into the sink. I reattached it (making sure I had the threads lined up right and everything) and tried again, but the same thing kept happening. After the sixth time or so, the thing wouldn't even screw on at all. There's just not enough thread on the faucet for the filter to hook onto securely.I've problems with these things (a few different Brita and Pur units) in all but one place I've lived, so if you're going to buy one, make sure you've got more than just 3 or 4 threads on the end of your faucet. And don't put any fragile dishes underneath the thing until you're sure it'll stay on."
1,"Bad parts, bad customer service","On some sinks, this product requires an adapter to be installed. It comes with two plats tic adapters which customer service admits are bad. They will send you new metal adapters with longer threads, but these are back ordered and may take two days or may take a month to be shipped to you. Although they admit their customers all ask for an estimate of the backlog, they can't or won't talk to other departments in their company to find out how long the backlog is. Their customer service staff is extremely RUDE and almost antagonistic from the start of the call. Their customer service staff were a textbook example of how NOT to handle phone calls. I ,would never recommend this product!"
1,Worse than nothing.Bad design.Bad quality.Won't last a month.,"This ""on tap"" filter is so poorly made that even getting a month out of it is pretty unlikely. The threads to attach to the faucet are of such low quality that they strip. leak and spray all over the place with any movement at all. The seals and gaskets are about as cheap as you can imagine, and their durability is zero. Tightening the threads, dislodge the washer and you get leaks. If the washer stays misaligned you have back flow through the faucet bypass and you get unpure water spraying into your cup. I cannot imagine a worse design. Shame on you, brita. You should be apologizing for this disaster."
2,Consistently disappointing - develops leaks in 2-3 months,"I have always used Brita filters since the first drip pitcher came out. I love the taste of the treated water, but don't like how biofilm builds up if you don't clean the pitcher frequently. So I switched to the faucet version. While the water still tastes great, the faucet filter has many physical flaws. As mentioned many times before, you need to get the metal adapter. Also, I find that the filter does not click into place as it should. It still works, but seems to ride a little high on my base unit. The switch to change between flow through and filtered water is hard to get a good grip on and difficult to turn. My twelve year old daughter could barely use it. When my first base unit sprung a leak within a few months, I chalked it up to bad luck. When my SECOND unit had the same failure, I decided enough is enough. i switched to a Culligan and so far could not be happier. The design is so much better than Brita's."
3,You have to know how to use it,"I've had my unit for a good five years and it works great--but only if you take it off the faucet and clean it now and then (with soap and a toothbrush). The small filters in the main unit itself get clogged with gunk, and over time so do the threads in the faucet and the plastic unit, creating a bad fit and leaks and spurts. I just wish it had refillable filters--such a terrible waste of resources and money to have to buy a whole new heavy plastic thing every month or so when all it needs is a little door through which a filters or pebble-size pieces could be taken in and out."
1,Waste of Plastic and Money,"At first it seemed to fit my tap and work well although switching to tap water took a little force, but within days it was leaking and popping of the faucet constantly."
1,Cheap Design with plastic parts,"We had a PUR Faucet filter, but it would only last one round of filters before leaking all over the place, so we tried Brita instead. This filter was worse because before I even had a chance to use the filter, the pressure of turning on the water forced the whole filter system off of the faucet, due to the fact that Brita uses cheap plastic parts, especially the threading inside the connector. This ended up stripping the threads and made the product useless. I would not recommend this filter. The PUR filter at least lasted through one filter, but I'm shopping around for other brands."
2,Wont Stay On Faucet,"So far, so good. I haven't had any problems with leaks yet and the water tastes great. I didn't think the difference between filtered and unfiltered water would be that great but it is.6/28/10: Well, I have changed my mind now. Since installation the filter has fallen off the faucet 3 times. If Pur can get its act together I will buy their newest tap filter.8/20/10: Indicator light no longer works. Probably banged up from falling off faucet so many times."
2,Don't take it off!,"The brita filter worked when it was first attached but once it was removed, it leaked. It leaked so bad that when you're trying to get filtered water in your glass you get tap water as well. I love brita products but if you're considering this over a pitcher, get the pitcher!"
1,The plastic threads strip too easilly,"I have been fighting this filter for a week. It leaked slightly at the coupling when installed. With use it began leaking more and within 6 days after it was installed it just fell off the faucet. The cheap plastic threads on the device are to blame. They only engage 2 or 3 threads on the supplied adapters. The adapters themselves seem to be undersized as well. Brita should be ashamed of this product. I have never experienced something as frustrating and completely useless right out of the box. Great idea, poor execution. Save your money and try something else."
1,Absolute garbage!,"This is the worst product to ever wear a brand name in my opinion. This product obviously didnt go thru a quality control check prior to production. Inferior quality must've been made from the cheapest material china had to offer. It leaks like crazy!! Every time I turn on my faucet, I get a shirt and face blast of cold water due to the leaky seal/connection of this faucet mount kit to my sink even with a stainless steel adapter from Home Depot added to ensure proper fit. Due to me being a germophobe I still dealt with it just to have clean drinking water. Then one day when changing the leaky filter, I noticed a decent amount of mildew due to water getting past the flawed design of the way it seals. I've been drinking tap water ever since. Bottom line, look for another design or another manufacturers filtration kit as this one doesnt even deserve one star."
1,It Leaks!,I used a Brita filter like this one for several years and it worked fine. I bought this one as a replacement. Apparently the new ones are not as well made as my first. I should have listened to other reviews. It easily comes unattached from the faucet and leaks until I retighten it. Then it comes loose again and leaks. So on and so on. Very annoying. I am returning it for a refund.
1,Will not stay connected to faucet!,"This is the most frustrating water filter ever! When it works the water tastes great, but it will not stay connected to the faucet because britta skimped on the connector and made it very small. Terrible design. Sometimes I'll get a good connection and it will stay on for a week, but every time time I turn on the faucet and set it to filter the water I brace myself for it to come blasting off. About 50% of the time it does. I'm returning it."
1,"keeps falling off my faucet, sprays water everywhere","I bought this because I was tired of constantly filling the Brita pitcher, and because the on-tap system was on sale for about $16 at a local grocery store.On numerous occassions, when I turn the water on in the filter position, the whole unit has shot off the faucet landing with a big KLUNK in my sink. And it's a pain in the neck to get it back on.A few minutes ago, I turned it on, and it just sprayed water all over me and my floor like a geyser. If the unit doesn't fly off completely, it sprays you. This is the second time it's sprayed.Not worth the aggravation and clean up time."
1,Useless plastic fittings,"My first Brita On Tap filter system lasted five years, and then the selector handle broke off. I bought a replacement, and the new model comes with cheap, worthless plastic pipe adapters. After screwing the filter system on to my faucet I can break it off with the force of one finger. I threw those adapters out and used the stainless steel adapter that came with my original unit, and that holds the filter fine.The steel adapter costs less than a quarter at a hardware store. By saving themselves a dime with the plastic adapter, Brita cost themselves four stars in my review."
4,Convenience on tap,"This is the third time I've replaced the Brita faucet filter. They last about a year - the length of the guarantee. It makes all the difference in the taste of city water (which I can't stand to drink otherwise). I will continue to use these as they're so convenient and easy to attach. A green light lets you know it's working and turns red when it's time to replace the filter so you know you're covered. It filters out cysts, much of the chlorine and bacteria, etc. Good little filter for a low price."
2,Doesn't Filter Well,"When comparing this to the typical Brita pitchers I have to say that it doesn't taste like the filter is doing much. A fresh filter in the pitcher version made a noticeable difference, this does not - it tastes just like the tap water."
1,A filter or a bomb?,"This horrendous product is a waste of your time and money. Using the internal thread adapter I soon found that after tightening a certain degree it would make a clicking noise and go from tight to loose. The ""loose"" setting leaks a tremendous flow of water. The ""tight"" setting filters about 2 L of water before violently exploding, shooting the filter like a rocket into your sink. What's worse is that I can find no evidence of the threads actually stripping! Meaning that some overpaid oaf in quality control actually missed this little gem. Perhaps I can get it to shoot into my eye so I can sue Brita...Oh and the automated system in the complaints department apparently deemed that I need new adapters. They are in the mail. Never talked to a real person."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"The design of this product is very poor if you need to use it on a faucet with inside threads. That was the case with mine and it fell of within miutes of installation. Even when it stays on you can't really touch it without it falling off. FWIW, I've remodeled and installed several bathrooms and kitchens - I'm very familiar with plumbing. I went over everything carefully when I installed it and even tried alternate washers to see if they might get a little extra more room for the threads to engage. The bottom line is that the insert is under-sized for the load the filter and water pressure put on it. They should have made the insert longer and probably out of brass or something more substantial than the plastic they used. Britta should be ashamed of putting their name on this product. Don't waste your time with this if you sink threads are on the inside of the faucet. I don't know about using it with externally threaded faucets but I would look for a better overall engineered unit."
3,"An OK poduct, but doesn't really work","I have had this filter for about 6 months, and I love having clean drinking water, after 6 months the indicator light no longer works. When I called Brita, I was sent to an automated answering system that said to put the filter on again. I have replaced the filter several times, and still no indicator light."
2,Great taste but do not last...,"This product seems to only design to last max 1 year as it will start to leak like crazy. Luckily in Australia they offer 2 year warranty so I got it replaced. But I will not go back to this system, turn to the jug one instead."
1,"Pops right off, do not buy!!","This unit replaced our other Brita on-tap filter and it does pop right off after a few hours of use, just like other reviewers said! I even have an externally threaded faucet so didn't need any adapters, the unit simply can't handle the water pressure. The older, non-chrome model fit more tightly and could handle the pressure, this one can't at all - shame on Brita, this would have been obvious from testing!"
2,Eventially will break,No doubt this will eventually leak and get gross because it's hard to clean and maintain. swapped it out for the following. Way betterPUR DS-1800Z 2-Stage Water Dispenser
1,Fix for Brita 42201,"Because of the thickness of the sieve washer (3/16"") it was not possible to engage the threads and attach the unit to the faucet. Replaced the included part with an O-ring (13/16"" OD, 1/16"" thick)and could attach it. The part with the thread is a cheap plastic and appears the threads could be easily stripped. Don't know whether this is poor design or poor manufacture."
1,Not good for micro-suede,I needed something to clean up my couches after the past year of my infant sons spitting up and making stains on them. The couch is a micro suede fabric and i hoped this would work but i was skeptical because it doesn't mention what fabrics it works best with. i sampled the ottoman and to my displeasure it left the fabric feeling rough and only removed half the stains. I would not recommend this product for micro suede but i will try it on the rug next time it is needed.
3,it's OK,Was able to remove minor stains from my sofa but did not work for hard stains.So look at your stains and then buy this product.
3,Handy shampoo,This is a fine product. It did not quite clean the upholdstry as I had hoped. The material is cloth with some water marks from past efforts. Overall it improved the appearance but not as much as I expected.
3,bissell fabric cleaner,Product cleaned a not particularly bad spot off of a micro-fiber couch. Did pretty well on cleaning but left a various obvious ring. After several attempts to remove ring it continues to appear although faintly. Would not buy this product again - I have 3 cans to try to find a use for.
3,Didn't work for what i wanted,It DOES NOT fit GM products that connect directly to the wiper arm. It's too big for that. Never did find what I was looking for. :(
1,"Horrible, freaky tale with nothing to offer.",This is an example of how misleading Amazon ratings can be. I purchased because my kids need math help and there were positive reviews. Instead it is a bizarre story with a freakish protagonist. There is no way past the distracting story line to get to the math. We could not get through this book -- Nightmare alert! This is going right in the trash.
5,Extremely easy to relate to and highly amusing!,"I've read this book a few times and written papers on it, and it gets better each time I read it! I even got the chance to see Ms. Narayan speak, and she was just as witty and charming in person as in her writing! This book is about Gita, a 23-year-old who has grown up her whole life in India but has recently come to Berkeley, California to do a graduate degree. The book is chock full of her experiences in adjusting to American culture. Especially amusing are her efforts to not appear as the innocent, naive girl that she is! The plot takes an interesting, unpredictable turn about midway through the book. Overall, the reader comes away with a hilarious and thought-provoking book that is a very enjoyable read."
2,Surprised by all the good reviews,"Frankly, I'm surprised by all of the good reviews this book got. I really didn't like it at all. You can see the ending coming a mile away, and it takes SO long to finally get there. The book also skips big sections in time -- for instance, one chapter ends with Gita getting married, and when the next chapter begins, she's divorced, with only a cursory explanation of what happened in the meantime. Gita also seems to make a drastic change in character from the beginning of the book to the end, but it doesn't really make sense -- the change is not developed well.I would advise you not to waste your time on this book -- there are many other books by female Indian writers, like Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni and Bharati Mukherjee, that are much better reads."
4,Soothing read,"I am not through it yet, but so far its been soothing and insightful. I have not understood all I read but perhaps we aren't meant to, what speaks to us when we need it, speaks to us when we need it."
4,Great West Meets East Prayer,I liked it a lot. It's not direct and requires a lot of thought and meditation to gain the messages of the Master.
5,Couldn't put it down!,This book was awesome...I stayed up all night reading it. It is with much anticipation I am waiting for more books from this author.
5,I couldn't put this book down...I want everyone to read it.,"Stacey is a very talented author. I read this book in 4 days which is a first for me. Every page turned into a new adventure. Throughout the entire book, I kept imagining this story as made-for-TV movie. I loved it. I'm giving this book to my family and friends as gifts. Good luck to you Stacey. I'm looking forward to your next novel. Wow!"
4,"""Deception"" keeps you on an unsuspecting ride of suspense!","""Immaculate Deception"" lives up to it's title by keeping you guessing about where the book is headed. You'll love the humor and the angst of the characters, as well as the roller coaster ride toward the end"
5,I Couldn't Put It Down!,"A winner of a thriller... I loved the characters and I literally stayed up all night to finish this incredible page-turner. If you're going to buy one book this year, Immaculate Deception should be it. Stacey, we're waiting desperately for your second novel."
2,Immaculate Deception,"Unfortunately, this book let me down. I thought from the descriptions and rave reviews I'd read here that this book would be really good, but the book never lived up to those comments. The writing was so amateurish as to be embarrassing, and the grammar and punctuation so distracting that I wanted take a red pen to the pages. Rather than not being able to put this book down, I wanted to put it out with the recycling. There are too many good books out there. Skip this one."
1,Horrible!,"Very misleading photo!This is plastic and.. Satin? Some cheap shiney material that looks really gross.I wouldn't even reccomend this for children, the quality of this piece is very poor.For $5 more you can get a real metal one, with quality materials. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Naruto Headband,"It's a headband....you wear it on your head. Don't know what there is to say here. If you want costume accessories, a headband like this would work very nicely"
3,"Pretty good, classic tragic hero....","I thought that this book started off with a lot of potential, but in the end, I was disappointed. I didn't think it much a mystery. The psychological issues that Mother had were interesting...but not enough so to keep me intrigued throughout. I felt Photi was a great character, but more development could have been given. I was very disappointed with the finale and how Photi turns out. However, Photi is truly a tragic hero and we all love that in a novel."
1,A pretentious exercise,"The apparently gormless Photi is the subject of Flokos' ""romance."" (This is apparently between - take your pick - Photi and the Winged Victory of Samothrace, his Mother, and ""Mother,"" an Amerikana, who returns to create a documentary about the pillaging of the statue by a French antiquarian in the nineteenth century.) Photi wants to bring his ikon back to the island: it means so much to him. (Apparently, too, he wants his dead mother back.) Heavy-handed, half-baked, this book suggests that it is the product of a Katzanzakis wannabe. The skein of male-female relationships focussed on Photi is so heavily Oedipal and really psychologically unrealized that even the lighthearted touches (the village as narrator) are dragged down. Read Katzanzakis. Don't bother with this."
1,Don't buy,"For the price, I was really disappointed in the sound of these cymbals. The sound would have been just as good if I crashed a couple pots and pans together. I was hoping for a brighter resonating sound, but was very disapointed."
2,Quality slip.,"I first became acquainted with RB instruments through a teacher friend who owns a set for her classes. My friend's RB 7"" cymbals have a bright clear bell-like tone with a good sustain and the wood handles are designed perfectly. I would put the sound of those small cymbals up against more expensive larger ones.When I saw these on Amazon I ordered them right away then, returned them even faster. The reviewer who said their sound was like pots and pans clanged together was being kind. They were flat - dull with a terrible tone. Not the clear, pleasant,ringing sound of my friend's. They were also flimsy, a thinner gauge metal. I would not recommend these cymbals now.RB does make quite good instruments for teaching music to children. In this case the quality is not up to their usual standards. Too bad, they can do better."
1,Small & waste of money,"My son didn't like it, and the handle wasn't plastic it was wood. Don't buy it. :-( I was hoping my son to have fun with it; unfortunately, he left it under his bed sinse he had tried it when UPS had dropped it."
5,A1 show!,"I think it's really great how the original X-Men Animated Series is making its way onto DVD. This disc includes a bundle of high-quality episodes and is definitely worth the cash. If sales go well, hopefully more episodes will be released as well. :-)"
3,Interesting Text,I obviously got this book for a class so it was clearly not a pleasure read. It was very informative and opens your eyes to women artists throught history and the social development from the 1400's through today. Very interesting text book.
3,Oh boy this is not easy reading...,"This was a required text for a class I took this semester. The PRICE was great and I love how small the paperback copy I received was. The book itself does not really hold my attention at all and I would not buy it if I was not a student. Puts me right to sleep he he. The good news though is when you buy books from Amazon, you can usually sell them back for credit( which I will probably use for more textbooks next semester) toward your account."
5,EXCELENT,EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WOMEN STUDIES & ART.FROM THE HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL STUDIES POINT OF VIEW.
3,Wordy!,"This book does conatain some truly valuable information, unfortunately it is also full of so much useless information that you become completely overwhelmed."
2,Book purchase,"Great price, excellent condition, fast shipping, boring book. I needed this book for a class everything was great other than how boring of a book it was. I will purchase from this place again."
2,don't get this version,"Do not buy this. Animeigo is releasing a restored and uncut version of the origonal Macross saga on DVD. Their web page has details about release date. You'll be really upset if you spend your money on this, and then find out that the better versions were released a few months later."
4,It's a talking keychain,"Item is as described, a talking keychain. It is funny....although the only reason I bought it was for Long Duc Dongs single saying....if they made one with just his lines I would've bought that instead."
5,awesome,"This album is spectacular, a true thrash metal classic that should not be left out of anyones metal collection. Buy now you wont regret it!!"
5,THRASH LEGACY!!!!!,"TESTAMENT is one of the best HEAVY/THRASH METAL bands of all time!!!! THE LEGACY, their debut is a THRASH METAL MASTERPIECE...ALONE IN THE DARK, FIRST STRIKE IS DEADLY, THE HAUNTING, RAGING WATERS...All the songs are pure THRASH!!! in the most raw and genuine way!!!! One of the best debuts ever, and one of the best from TESTAMENT!!!! REALLY GREAT!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!"
3,Mid 80's thrash metal,"Testament came blasting forth in the mid 80's from the famed Bay area, riding the coattails of Metallica's success. ""The Legacy"" was, in its day, a good, solid thrash disc. ""Over the Wall"" and ""Curse of the Legions Of Death"" still rage. But today the disc hasn't aged well. The sound quality is poor and the songs seem rushed. Lead guitarist though, Alex Skolnick, had tremendous playing ability and is the one saving grace of this disc. His lead playing and his riffing were indicative of his talent and skill, which would eventually shine in later Testament discs. But like all musicians who feel stagnant if their hearts aren't into it, Skolnick left the band after the horrible ""The Ritual"" was released. ""The Legacy"" though,stands as a good starting point for a band that should have been beter than they were."
5,One of the Greatst Thrash Albums!!,"This is one of the greatest Thrash albums ever!! if your into early Metallica like Kill em All, this is the album for you. it starts off with Over the Wall, which i liked right away. all the songs were actually good. Burnt Offerings is a chilling song. But my favorite would have to be Alone in the Dark. and no this band is not a rip off Metallica as others like to call it. if your into 80,s Thrash, you MUST buy this!! and check out their 88 album. let Thrash live on!! id put Testament up there as one of my favorite Thrash bands!! METAL MILITIA!! ""Slaughter of the innocent"""
1,Frogger Quest .....,"I have a brand new, state of the art, XP computer and this game will not load. As new as my computer is, I shouldn't need any new drivers for a game that states it is XP compatiable. I think Konami needs to go back to the drawing board and figure out what they have done wrong! It shouldn't be this difficult to get a game to work. Plus, their customer service doesn't respond in a timely manner. I guess everyone is out laying on the beach getting a suntan."
2,Frogger: The Great Quest,"I purchased this game because I so enjoyed the much earlier versions of Frogger. Thinking that this game would be pretty much the same as the older versions, I happily purchased it.The graphics are really cute, but clearly, this game was not intended for play on your computer. It is difficult to navigate the frog with the arrow keys, and this can get very frustrating. I was very disappointed, as I thought it would be a good game for computer use. Wrong!If you are considering buying this game, be aware that is it not computer friendly. I can't get past the second screen.....because of navigation problems wwith the arrow keys."
1,Frogger,It does not work on my XP pc. It is supposed too. This is a piece of junk I met all the requirements for install
1,This product does not work and there is no customer service,"This product installed without any problems. When you try to get into the game, it tells you that there is a problem with the exe file. I tried calling customer service, but was told they did not support game problems and that I should go on the website or send a e-mail. I sent an e-mail, but received no reply. Each time I went on the website it told me they were down for maintenance.THIS STINKS!!!!!! I will never buy another one of their games again."
1,"Disappointed, game won't load","I verified we had all the system requirements before we bought this game but it will not load. We spent the better part of an hour on Christmas morning trying to troubleshoot the error message with no luck. We should not have to go to this much trouble. Update: February 2012 we finally just tossed it out. We won't buy from this seller again, that's for sure."
4,works great,works wonderfully. I have it in the room with my cat litter and you can't even smell the litter. Only problem is that it is very loud.
1,Product stopped working after only two months,I purchased this product and after occasional use it stopped working within two months.I own three similar TrueAir products and they have functioned flawlessly for over two years.
1,Hamilton Beach True Air,"Great value with speedy delivery, but unfortunately the product was defective and did not work when plugged in. I was highly satisified with Amazon's refund process, although I would have preferred to take a chance on a replacement rather than a refund."
5,An amazing suspenseful thriller that keeps you on edge.,"""She didn't even recongnize me"", said her friend Stella. This story made me want to see it the second I saw the story. Simone Chuele is the tenant of a small apartment in an old building on a quiet street in Paris. One day she jumped out the window and was put into acoma for a couple of days. A quiet man named Trelkovski comes to the building and settles himself down in the vacant apartment that Simone left. Trelkovski later forms a good realationship with one of Simones friends, Stella. He slowly becomes frustrated with his neighbors accusing him of causing noise when he didn't and insane because of the ghostly figures in the bathroom window. If you pay attention to all of the happenings, you will know exactly why all of these things happened. Just the perfect ammount of horror here. Especially Simone screaming in the hospital bed. See it A.S.A.P."
2,Artsy to a fault,"There are two types of people that don't like this movie: Those that don't understand it (I pity those) and those like me that think the movie was just a little too strange for their liking. I understand the theme of paranoia ingrained in the movie, I understand that he was so nervous about people accepting him, that his mind shattered and he dressed up as the woman that used to live there. You see the contrast between him and ""Real"" men in the movie. But at the same time, the ending was too much, especially with him screaming at seeing ""Himself"" at the end, it just was too out there. And the subtle hints of his paranoia, really hid any terror behind this film. I enjoy a strange and slow flick, I loved the ninth gate. This just wasn't my thing."
3,"Please, be a little bit quieter....","No, no Kafka-esque sense of danger. K did not realize the sense of danger. He merely became the small focus of outside forces. That is not danger. It may be inevitability. Trelkovsky willingly goes into ""danger"". Accepts his need to become that which will cause him grief. K willingly goes on his way. A Pole and a Czech at odds! How delicious! Not to mention bumptious Frenchmen. The movie is about 23.5 minutes too long, however."
1,It makes no sense.,"'The Tenant' is a film by Roman Polanski that has been forgotten by most of the film community, and for good reason because it makes no sense and is downright awful. It stars Polanski himself as a shy and timid new tenant to an apartment complex. He soon realizes that his neighbors are extremely sensitive and don't like the slightest disturbance. He learns the former tenant before him had committed suicide. A dress of the former tenant is left behind, and for some reason, not explained in the film, Polanski keeps the dress throughout the entire movie. As the story progresses, Polanski grow increasingly paranoid of his neighbors, having bizzare hallucinations at night.The movie is well done because of the talented director, but the story is too far-out and absurd to take seriously. There are some creepy moments, while others are embarrassing, but the entire film is ruined by the ridiculous ending"
1,DVD did not work,The DVD did not work and I emailed the seller for a refund and they never responded back.
2,DON'T BE FOOLED,"DONT BE FOOLED GUYS. THIS IS NOT A GREAT FILM NOT EVEN A GOOD ONE.THOSE WHO LIKE THIS FILM HAVE VERY LOW STANDARDS. HERE ARE SOME OF THEOBVIOUS SHORTCOMINGS. TERRIBLE ACTING (INCLUDING SHELLY WINTERS WHO WAS NEVER ANY GOOD), HORRIBLE EDITING, BUT MOST OF ALL THE TRANSFORMATION FROM SANE TO INSANE FOR THE MAIN CHARACTER DOES NOT PLAY WELL AT ALL AND IS NOT CONVINCING.THIS IS A VERY MODEST AND STANDARD STORY MAUFACTURED IN A MEAT MARKET. FOR THIS POLANSKI WAS CONSIDERED A GENIUS.IF YOU DONT AGREE WITH THIS REVIEW JUST WATCH ALL HIS FILMS AFTER THIS ONE - THEY ONLY GET WORSE."
2,Polanski misses on this dumb movie,"I watched this movie based on a Rotten Tomatoes 90% rating and a `5 Favorite Films' recommendation by director Brett Ratner. What I should have done is checked out Roger Ebert's 1976 review where he gave it 1 star out of 4. Roman Polanski of course, starred and directed this mess which I think was supposed to be a psychological thriller. Well, there are no thrills except when Polanski's character throws himself out a 3 story window, only to survive, climb back up the stairs and try it again. Unfortunately, that wasn't done until the end of the movie, but hey it is pretty funny, if unintended. After dragging out the NoDoz, I was curious to see if I had correctly figured this out, but along the way became so distracted by the various combinations of American/English accents and obvious dubs in what is clearly Paris, I lost interest. This movie is dumb, dumb, dumb."
5,Good,"I think it's a Great cable, fit's nice in my iphone 4. I used it for my kids concert, and the sound was great. It's the real deal"
3,Good product however not compatible with cases,"The product meets the needs and the sound quality is good too. The problem is I don't know of anyone who does not have a case for a their iphone and every time I have to remove the case to connect to car stereo which is pain, other than that there are no issues."
3,OK for a while,"I got this cable because it looks less ""cheap"" than most of the others and I expected the quality to match. It worked fine for a while, but a gap soon showed up between the cable insulator and the plug on the 3.5mm stereo end, exposing wires. The cable still worked fine for a while (maybe a year of very occasional use), but eventually something must have shorted out and it no longer functions. So 3 stars since it did work for a while and only this one issue with my product seems to have been its downfall. I'm going to replace it with a different brand and see if I have any better luck."
3,average cables,the wires arent tough enough for everyday use i only had it for less than a week and the wires are ripping apart already .
4,Works with iPods and a Minivan!,"Purchased this to connect iPod to the aux input of a minivan's RCA jacks. It worked great for that, however, the larger diameter of the headphone jack end of the cable prevents this from plugging into an iPod Touch 2nd or 3rd Gen with a chunky case like the OtterBox Defender. To accomodate that an extender that is the diameter of the typical earbuds will be required. The quality of the cable seems _very_ good (nice feel and good flexibility). Overall, good value and quality product and at 7 feet this gave a bit more length than other cables."
3,Looks good Okay Quality Okay Design,"Good price, Works Okay, Clean Packaging, Color Coded Easy to readProduct is average to low in design form and use. Not the best not the worse.Would buy again if cost is more important and visual appearance and ease of install."
4,Belking does it again.,"I give this product a four only because the jacks fit very tightly and I'm afraid I might break them every time I pull them off. Other than that, the cord quality is excellent, the looks are nice, and it is heavyweight, which I also like. Good long cord. Better than others of same price.EDIT: Damn. It broke and only gives sound through one channel. The product is still excellent if you don't plan on moving the jacks (i.e. a stationary AV setup)."
2,Lasted a year and a half,"The sound was good through these cables, but the cable pulled out of the connectors and quit working after a year and a half."
3,"Nice cable, Good quality, good price point",My only complaint is that the cable does not attach through my IPOD metal case. Ear plugs fit through the metal case without any issues. Either the IPOD metal case opening needs to be bigger or the belkin cable heads need to be a smaller.
2,Disappointed,I was a little disappointed when I got the cable in the mail... it wasn't what I was looking for.
4,sturdy,"cheap cables seem to fray at the ends and this is robust, but its still starting to fray after a few months now.i think next time i'll buy 90 degree bent audio in. that may help.otherwise very thick."
4,Solid cable,"Haven't used it yet but see no reason to rate it down. The gold plate leads seem to be a marketing ploy; I don't see how they would help the audio quality of an already low digital media file. I suppose it is useful if you have high quality media, but other than that, you'll be fine with just about any cord."
5,This stuff works--even on pet stains!,"I just bought a Bissell ProHeat 2X deep steam cleaner a few weeks ago and it came with a bottle of this pre-treat spray for stains. I had some dark and long-set-in doggie stains that I wasn't sure I'd ever get out. I used this pre-treat spray and let it set a while (it says 3 minutes, I think, but some of mine were pre-treated an hour or so ahead of time). When I went through with the steam cleaner, I was amazed to see those stains come up completely. You can't even tell they were there!I'm definitely buying another bottle pronto!"
5,Works Great!,This product works great when used with our Bissell carpet cleaner that has uphostery cleaning attachments.Cleans carpets really well too.
3,Huge improvement and Epic Fail,"Did not work on freshly spilled coffee, despite coffee being featured as removable. It did however work on a variety of other types of stains including older stains, such as some food stains and oil stains. Products like this are always hit and miss in my experience. It's much better than nothing."
5,works great,"orderd this wit some parts just to fill up a order and get free shipping. WOW, I LOVE IT!!!! I used it on some bad stains when I cleaned or carpets and WOW!! its great stuff!!!"
3,Not that Tough,"I used this in an admittedly really tough room-my mother's bedroom. It didn't do as well as I expected, but my expectations were pretty high. I pretreated the stains as directed, but they didn't budge. I ended up buying Woolite Heavy Traffic instead, which was the right product. I'd say the fault was mine in this case, these were pretty nasty stains to work on."
4,Pretty good.,"This is a pretty fascinating book, containing the works attributed to Hermes in English as well as the non-translated version, revealing one version on one page and the other version on the next page; Thus, when one reads the book, they find the non-translated version on one page and the English version on the other page, with footnotes and stuff to help out. Overall, a good book, and it gives some understanding of the thinking of the ancient Magickians and other Occultists. Worth getting, overall."
1,Not Appropriate for a newborn,This car seat does not recline like the others. For a newborn it is awful. My son's head keeps falling to the side and constantly have to hold it up. The hood of the car seat does not stay up either and keeps falling down . I would never recommend this car seat to anyone. Too much money for such a bad product.
1,TERRIBLE car seat,"This car seat is absolutely horrible. I don't understand how it is suppose to keep my little boy safe in an accident. It does not recline enough to be a safe infant car seat. My little one's head flops over or to the side and I have to keep one hand on the steering wheel and the other one holding up his head. Which is completely unsafe. Also, the straps are not adjustable to the head rest. If you want to move the straps higher than the head rest moves up higher as well as they are connected. The Chicco has multiple strap slots. Wish this product had the same. I really wish we would have purchased a Graco (even though it's not as cute, but it is much more comfortable and fits with the Bugaboo) or a Chicco (looks super comfortable, but it doesn't go with the Bugaboo). Please don't buy this product. Your baby and bank account with thank you."
3,Sony camcorder light,I found the light to be only useful for close-up work where light is required. It provides little for anything more than a close one on one video recording. And that is what I wanted it for anyway!
3,Batteries not included...Lame!,"Ok, so maybe I didn't read the fine print. I assumed that this light came with batteries, and it didn't. Fine. Fully prepared to load up with four alkaline AA batteries, I decided to read the instructions first. ""Do not use alkaline batteries."" According to the instructions, if you use any batteries other than Sony rechargable batteries, the unit may malfunction.It's true. Energizer NiMh batteries work for about two seconds and then the unit shuts off.When the light does work, it does not significantly improve the video quality. I would not buy this product again."
2,better than nothing..but,"still not great. Sucks down some serious battery life. Tried using some high end rechargeables but still had no luck.As someone else mentioned, this will only work with in close range.I mean for most of the cameras this is your only option and it is better than having no light, if you plan on recording and event (wedding) make sure you have about 20 sets of batteries...."
1,Too pricey not enough light for filming,I could have gotten more lighting power from a 99cents flashlight! Don't buy is not worth it! Like I said use a flashlight!
3,Regular,"Buena luz, pero con dos desventajas muy grandes, el boton de encendido es muy dificil de acceder con una sola mano, hay que utilizar las dos manos para encender la lampara, hay que soltar la camara para ocupar las dos manos en el encendico de la luz.Otro desventaja es es el consumo excesivo de energia, pero recomiendo comprar las baterias que el manual aconseja que dan mejor rendimiento."
5,Living with wolves,I cannot say enough great things about this video. It is so beautifully done and the way the Dutchers show the true personality of the wolves as loving family members instead of ferocious beasts is so fantastic to see. This vidoe got me interested in wolves when it first came out. I do have the VHS in my library but after traveling to Idaho for my 60th birthday to see the remaining Sawtooth pack member I had to update my library with the DVD. If you love wolves this DVD is a must!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Very Little Value,"At a time when college Web sites contain vast amounts of data, not to mention PR and virtual tours, this hapless volume contributes just about nothing to the process of finding a school. The author uses imaginary candidates who golly just can't decide! Let's make a list and compare libraries! There is no independent research, no insights into systems, just a compilation of check-lists and the obvious. In this entire book no person is quoted by name and no actual college mentioned by name.I could recommend the section on college interviews if it were a column in a newspaper--it could be easily reduced to that length. You buy a book like this because there's a small chance you'll learn something you didnt already know. I assure you in this case you won't."
2,save your $,"stupid book. talking to me and my college bound son in terms i speak to toddlers. i guess if you lack commen sense, then get this book, other wise save your $ for college tuition."
4,campus,i need to know what all is necessary to be the best in the interviews in this fast moving world
2,disappointing,"I bought my daughter one of these for Christmas. It was fun for her until the first time we washed it. Some of the marker wouldn't quite wash off. I have now washed it three times and it still has not come off completely. And yes, I am absolutely certain she used the enclosed markers with it. Shame, because she liked it otherwise."
3,Good Debunking Stuff!!,"Filled with all sorts of good stuff!This type of book is great for scaring people (25 years ago) and is common among the doomsdayers. I think Chuck Smith decided to stop predicting the end of the world with the next book after this, around 1988, but this is informative anyways.I like how he begins his premise about the end of the world by stating if he interpretes scriptures correctly this is when he believe the end of the world will occur. He then proceeds to predict that 1981 will be the end.Most people will agree that the end of the world did not occur, in 1981 unless we missed it.Three stars, not for accuracy, but for debunkingness."
5,great movie,"as for daniel's music - you either get it, or you don't. and if you don't that's kinda just too bad."
2,"I'm note sure who is crazier, these reviewers or Daniel himself.","Like a few of the reviews here, I originally thought this was a mockumentary. As soon as I heard Daniel start singing I was laughing so hard I had to pause the DVD.Genius? In a room of mental patients maybe. The fact that Daniel cannot sing and can barely play the guitar make me wonder why people admire him so much. I think the funniest thing in the entire movie is that TWO major labels were actually in a bidding war for him. and his album went on to sell less than 6,000 copies! I'm sure the guy that signed him is flipping burgers at Wendy's now.As a film, its not bad. I think Daniel is a relatively good pop artist in the Keith Haring vein more than anything, but as a singer-song writer, I'm sorry he is god awful."
5,Must See Now,"I first heard Daniel Johnston a few years ago when I was in high school. Kurt Cobain turned me onto lots of music, including Daniel. At first I thought it was terrible, just another artist that pretentious people enjoy. Oh, how naiive I was. This documentary will show you why Daniel Johnston is one of the most important songwriters/artists alive today. He puts all the pain, ugliness, and humor of his life into his art. And what a life he has had. The whole story is almost mythological, really. The best part of the doc. is how well Daniel managed to record his life over the years using tape recorders, cameras etc. The filmmakers must have wet their pants when Daniel handed that stuff over. I mean, he recorded EVERYTHING. I originally saw this doc. in a theater and I must say, it is equally parts hilarious, moving, and tragic. Now I can watch it in the comfort of my own home. THANKS AMAZON!"
4,Holmes HM1700 Humidifier,"You get what you pay for. It is great for larger rooms, but it definitely does not last anywhere near 24 hours on a fill. Its more like 8. It can be a little loud, but it does work very well, and you can immediately feel the effects."
1,A Very Loud Machine,"I believe it says: ""Whisper Quiet"" on the box. I guess it's ""whisper quiet"" when I'm three rooms over in the Kitchen with the dishwasher running! Even on the low setting, this humidifier is unbearably loud!"
2,Way too loud,"This humidifier is way too loud. I'm sure it does a good job but I just don't want to listen to the noise it makes all day. Might be good as white noise outside of your therapist's office, but that is not what I am looking for."
3,You get what you pay for,"OK, so it's not the greatest humidifier in the world. It's good for one room, I keep it in my bedrooom. It is effective for just the one room. The water container can run out quickly if you leave it on the ""high"" setting. If I leave it on ""low"" or ""med"" it often can stay filled while I sleep, however will need to filled in the morning. I will be empty if I leave it on while I go to work. It's decent. For a small apartment or single room it's good for only ... The filter can be a little hard to find, but it comes with and order form, and they tend to last a while."
3,GMRS1262 12-MileGMRS Twin Pack Radio,Doesn't work well through woodsy terrain and hilly areas. This is my second set of these walkie talkie (now have 4). The first set seems to work better. This set tends to squeal and give feedback. Our most frequent use for these is while skiing. They work wonderfully for keeping in touch.
2,Where are the batteries?,"I ordered 2 sets. Your ad said the radios come with batteries. No batteries. That is false advertising. What are you going to do? I am considering to never order anything from Amazon again, and tell all my friend about my experience. I hope you can correct this problem.Dave"
2,Nice idea . . . now they should finish the thought,"This is a great idea for a great marketing group . . . little kids who want to listen to music ""just like the big kids."" The FP3 has a few issues of it own, but the speakers were disappointing. The sound quality is not good. Even with the volume turned up it is difficult to hear. Another huge down fall is that a power cord is not available . . . so you can end up going through batteries pretty fast. To top it all off, my son has difficulty getting the FP3 correctly mounted into the speaker unit on his own. Overall we were very disappointed with this accessory."
3,Great idea but not perfect,"My daughter loves her speaker and listens/dances to her ""ipod"" with it every day. When moved around (which is all the time) it makes a high pitched noise. We change the batteries, try to adjust the FP3 player in the speaker, turn the vloume down and nothing helps too much. So while the background noise is irritating, my daughter loves it so much that we live with it!"
5,A must with the FP3 player!,"I bought these speakers for my [...] daughter for her birthday about a month after she received the FP3 player for Christmas. She already enjoyed listening to the music, but she uses the speakers all the time now, and now my [...] son can listen too at the same time. The speakers so far have proven to be very durable, they have been dropped on our hardwood floors many times with no problem, and very simple to use, my daughter had it down in less than 10 seconds, so I'm not always having to help her with it. The speakers also get loud enough for a group to enjoy, but not so loud that I'm concerned she could damage her hearing if she was very close. I would definitely recommend these to anyone, especially with siblings!"
5,A piece of my past.,I loved this series when I was in high school; I'd often be late to class just to finish watching the show. It's not the usual DVD quality but it is exactly like what we saw on TV and I'm happy to have started my collection of the series.
4,Top-notch Anime :-),"The first DVD volume of the Robotech series contains six excellent episodes, including the eyecatches to and from commercial breaks. In the late 1980s, F.H.E. had released a videotape of these same episodes edited together to form one ""movie;"" while that was okay, this presentation by ADV Films is far superior, allowing easy access to any particular episode on may wish to view.This is one of my favorite anime series. However, I can only rate this PlayStation2-compatible DVD as a ""4"" due to its construction. The main menu begins with a brief clip from the series without any actual menu selections immediately available, which can cause confusion for some users."
3,worst picture I have ever seen on dvd,"robotech is by far my favorite anime series and when I heard it was comming to dvd I was very excited,I couldn't wait,robotech on dvd tight!!It is even a great deal $12.99 for 6 episodes.But the value stops there the picture is the worst I have ever seen on a dvd grainy,faded downwright horrible absalutly no remastering here!If you are a robotech fan get it but don't expect great dvd quality video."
5,Incredible Deal!,"When I first heard that Robotech was coming out on DVD, I flipped! Now that I have it in my hands, I am still doing cartwheels! This is incredible. I remember watching Robotech on TV in the 80's and it truly moved me then, and still does today! If you haven't ordered this yet, DO IT NOW!"
2,Only a Dub...,"Well, I have been a long time fan of Macross and when the dvds were finally released I couldn't wait to buy them...and when I saw the price, I immediatly added it to my shopping cart.And then it arrived at my front door. I watched the first episode.No subtitled Japanese version... No extras... Only a dub...I would have rated this a one star, but it was Robotech...and I grew up on the dub."
2,Don't get this version,"Do not buy this. Animeigo is releasing a restored and uncut version of the origonal Macross saga on DVD. Their web page has details about release date. You'll be really upset if you spend your money on this, and then find out that the better versions were released a few months later."
3,You are going to hate it or love it,"Well, if you like the synth sound of the 80s then buy this. There are some nice tracks in all over the album. It's *very* 80s. Consider yourself warned."
5,"Very interesting, couldn't put it down","I was leery when I saw this book, thinking that Chris Darden was just trying to take advantage of his reputation from the OJ case. I purchased the book anyway and was pleasantly surprised to find it very interesting. I found it hard to put the book down until I finished it. Hope to see more books by these authors. In addition to being very interesting, it didn't have any gratuatous sex and violence."
2,"Weak, But Reads Easy","This book was quite a disappointment; it offers no insight into criminal prosecution in LA (which Darden should have provided) and ultimately is just another mystery novel. The authors burden themselves with too many characters, but have no interest in realistic dialgoue--everything sounds tinny and fake.The chapters are uniformly short (3-4 pages, tops), which makes reading easy. The plot is ho-hum; standard thriller stuff, with an admirable twist at the end. However, this book could have been so much more--Darden could offer an interesting in-depth look into criminal prosecution, but instead contents himself to do a half-baked job. Much like his work prosecuting OJ Simpson."
4,A pleasant surprise indeed...,"Whilst I normally follow the thriller market pretty closely I had never heard of Darden or Lochte when I picked up the paperback in a New Zealand bookstore (having run out of books).The first few pages did not make me expect much but what unfolded was a genuine good thriller with lots of surprises and believable characters you could identify with.The prosecutor Nikki Hill and the cop who helped her,the veteran Goodman ( it is very simple to envisage his namesake John in the film role)are smart and likeable. They have to fight the system in many ways and succeed( of course) in doing so, but to great personal cost.I really hope these two writers get together more and continue the tale of Nikki Hill."
5,A shocker of an ending!,"I'm used to being able to second-guess mystery writers, but Darden and Lochte had me completely faked out. Great characters and lots of fun!"
4,stay away,"This movie would be alright except for the technical glitches in the disc itself. The coding between each of the chapters takes you back to the chapter menu. Which is really annoying. How can Video Asia live with themselves. They should have recalled this product and fixed it. So, if you lack patience stay away."
3,Good read for Yankee fans,"If you are a Yankee fan who remembers the team of the mid-80's era, this book is a nice walk down memory lane. It's a quick, easy read written in an enjoyable narrative style, and it provides the reader with an inside glimpse that most of us Yankee fans would have given our left foot to experience."
5,A breath of Fresh air,Reading Bat Boy was a great deal of fun. It was a throwback book about baseball and a young man who was allowed a glimpse into the inner sanctum of the Yankees clubhouse.Matt describes everything that happened to him so vividly that you find yourself rooting for him to succeed or shaking your finger at him for his most recent goofy mistake. You are definitely along for the ride when you begin this book.My favorite part was the time between his first and second season when he gets involved in this pyramid scheme. I also appreciated Matt's honesty when discussing how he changed as a bat boy from his first year to his second year. It was quite a personality turnaround. Do what you have to do to get a copy of this book. You will not regret a minute of it.
4,A good read,"If you are a Yankees fan, it is fun to learn of some of the stories detailed in this book."
2,Too expensive for a poor book,Not a good reading; hope to have better details on players life and experience.Writer should review his book with real authors.
5,Not just for baseball fans,"Bat Boy is a compelling and entertaining book, even for someone who isn't necessarily a baseball fan. It is a story about the dreams of youth, when everything is still new and possible because we haven't yet been made timid by caution and restraint. Bat Boy is about deciding what you want, going for it, and miraculously getting it. And what is perhaps even more rare, finding that achieving and living a dream can be as good or better than the fantasy."
4,Bat Boy by Matthew McGough,"Once I started reading this book it was hard to put down. The author (Matthew McGough) takes you behind the scene of one of the most prestige franchise of any sports teams. You'll experience what it was like to be on the inside of Yankee Stadium. The star struck kid interacting with the ""Stars in Pinstripes"". It's a must read book for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a bat boy for a professional baseball team. Anyone who has ever wanted to know what takes place before, doing, and after a baseball game this is also a must read book. You'll also read about the ""good guys"" and the not so friendly guys who played for the Yankees. Find out it's not always glamorous being a ""bat boy"". Finally a ""kudos"" to his parents who made sure school work was always his priority over working Yankees games. Enjoy the adventure!Andre' Fontenot (former bat boy San Francisco Giants 1974)"
5,One of our favorites,This is the one CD that my husband & both enjoyed listening to. Our daughter slept in our room as a baby & we wanted something that we wouldn't mind listening to ourselves when she was falling asleep. This fit the bill. The music is gorgeous but not too kiddie to annoy us after a few listenings. We have to buy another one for our next child because this one was so well used.
2,16 oz. Smart Mug with Temperature Control - RED,"The smart mug sounded great, but it didn't hold the temperature very high, even when the temperature control was tuned to maximum. In just a few days part of the display quit working, and the power plug to the cup was a little awkward the way it stuck straight out so far.I reluctantly returned the cup, and still have not found a car mug to keep drinks warm satisfactorily."
3,ok,"pretty mug, work ok, however it does not get really hot regardless of high temperture......seller sent product quick & upon received the pruduct look just like the picture."
4,Good quality except the plug,"As others have pointed out, this is a great bargain but the cord is a poor choice. Takes about 3 minutes and cost around 5 USD to replace."
5,Great mug,I picked five stars because it works as it should. What else can i say about a heated coffee mug. Seams to keep the coffee hot
1,Short Life,I purchased this for my husband who has an extremely long (2 hours morning and night - 4 hours total) commute to work. It lasted about 2 weeks (tops) and then just died. We cannot find a good heated travel mug anywhere!
3,worn box,"Product was fine, the box look bad. Very worn and abused, had a old price label attached and the box was dirty."
5,Red heated mug for auto,I purchased this heated mug for my wife. She loves her coffee very hot and this can keep it very hot or heat it up if she has left it in the car without power. A great gift.
3,Maybe this will help,"I own one of these mugs from a different retailer. My car has separate power and lighter outlets. The mug works erratically and improperly while plugged into the lighter outlet, but just fine when plugged into the separate power outlet. Have no idea why. The product description indicates the power/lighter outlets to be interchangeable or equivalent, but possibly its not so."
1,Waste of Money!,"I bought this for my wife because she drinks a lot of tea while taking the kids to school. One good turn in the SUV and the thing tipped over and spilled everything all over the car. It's top heavy.Don't buy this, it's not worth the hassle."
4,So far so good,"My wife has used this a couple of times since purchase and reports that it works well for her. The highest setting makes it too hot for more than sipping. One caveat: because of its size, it teeters in the cupholder in her minivan, so she has to keep one hand on the mug when driving. This may not be a problem with deeper cupholders."
2,ok,"The product was as described but when i had delivery problems, the sender did not care to respond to my inquiries"
1,Very poor customer service,"I purchased this mug from this company, and it arrived damaged, and when I complaint about the problem they said they can ship me another one but in black color, and I needed in red color, after exchanging few emails I decided to return the mug and asked the rep to provide me the address where it can be sent, since then I never heard from this company, I would advice everyone not to deal with this company."
4,Just got the Smart-Mug,"A couple of things to note.1. If you were thinking the mug is stainless steel. It is not, rubber outer and the base has rubber, which works pretty good too, very soft when you put it down.2. You actually pay $28.50 for this mug including shipping and tax. So you are not actually spending around $20.3. It really works! gets your drink hot all the way from cold. I did it with milk and stopped at 120F was nicely hot, you can go to 160F i think.4. Takes a while to heat up. Not in a flash, but not too long either.5. It wont keep your drinks hot for too long like a stainless steel thermos when not plugged in.Cheers."
1,Smart Mug,I got one for Christmas too. The controls on the first one didn't work. The whole bottom began melting. I caught it before it caught fire when I noticed a smoky smell. I took the first back and got another. The second one worked one time and then quit.
1,SMART MUG,"I recently received this item for Christmas....the first one I got did not work at all...the second one stopped working after three uses...I am currently using a third one and it does not control the temperature at all. It is very dangerous since the temperature on the coffee just keeps getting hotter and hotter. I almost burned myself on it today. I will be returning this item and will not try a fourth one. Three strikes and you're out! I would not recommend this item to anyone. It does not work properly and is very, very dangerous and could cause serious injury. I am very disappointed in its performance."
1,does not work,The mug does not keep the coffee hot. I put this mug on the hottest temperature and the coffee was always lukewarm. I tried to return this but the company do not take back appliances. I would never buy from this company again.
1,Smart Mug Not so Smart,"Even though others had given this item less than stellar reviews, I had hoped that the manufacturer might have corrected earlier issues. Nope. As many have stated, this thing works for a few uses, then dies. When it works, it's a nifty little gadget, but that is for a brief time. Ours died after 3 uses."
4,Handy tool,"Great little slave flash for all types of cameras. Fits easily in your pocket. Has hi/low power modes. Note that this flash is completely manual (except for auto synchronizing with your main flash). It does not set the power level according to distance to target, so it's up to you to select the power level or to bounce it off the ceiling to get the correct lighting level for your shots (but this is easy to do with digital cameras because you can instantly review your shots)."
3,don't follow the instructions,"I was realy excited to transform megatron when he arived to day. I took him out of the box and looked it over. I could see how to change him but thought it would be best to do as the instructions said. They had me turn the legs the wrong way and as a result the head, botharms and both shoulders broke off. It is curently being repaired one boddy part at a time in my basement."
5,Great intro to Grand Canyon for adults and kids!,"Our Vacation Bible School theme this year was Discovery Canyon with an emphasis on the sights, scenes, and critters in the Grand Canyon. I ordered the video as a reference. We showed parts of the video as an intro and then often kept it running (sound off) during other activities. Kids loved the wildlife segments--especially the snake sneaking up on its prey. The part featuring classical music with scenes of the Canyon was particularly grand as kids were gathering--we even showed part of the Roy Rogers movie--black and white--during a snack break. We did quickly turn off the promo that listed one of the movies shot at Grand Canyon as ""Gay and Lusty""; the words today give a somewhat different message. The Grand Canyon video is about the best $20 I spent all summer!"
3,Good to watch on a long trip,"Great scenery and good to pass the time, not great on some of the comentary but othewise worth the price to download it and take it with you."
5,So much better than the Kardshians.,We need more programs like this instead of the junk that passes for entertainment elsewhere... I would prefer more in depth coverage for each area.
3,Dramatic,The scenery is quite nice but there wasn't anything I haven't seen before or heard before.I was hoping to learn something but this is more like a drama than a documentary.Might be good for kids.
1,"""Millions of years ago""","Thought this would be a great educational dvd for the kids, but many times the term ""many millions of years ago"" was stated and his theory of how the world was formed. This man does not believe in a Creator and expresses this many times throughout the video."
5,good stuff that does the trick,"good stuff, helped with odor and got up stains, a bit expensive but as far as functionality i have to give it a thumbs up."
1,Don't bother,"This product has a very nice smell. However, it does not work on pet vomit stains. I used it in my Bissell Little Green (which is also a total waste of money). So disappointing.The stains were fresh, the machine was new. I followed all directions to the letter. Worthless."
1,"Don't buy ""3-Pack""","The product itself performs satisfactory, but beware of the seller sending only 1 bottle, instead of the promised 3. After complaining, they sent a 2nd bottle...and after complaining again I was refunded $6 to my account for the never received 3rd bottle. I don't believe a 3-pack exists, but the seller assumes you will not bother to complain about getting only 1 bottle despite paying $20. They were wrong in my case. Hope this helps!"
3,"Odor=effective, Stains=not so good","This product did remove odor, but as far as stain removal, it is no different than the regular Bissell cleaning solution. These were not stains that sat for days either."
2,"Some chuckles, but not much more",Much of the material here duplicates that found in the Big Book of Jewish Humor (1981) but somehow manages to make the jokes worse with time. There are a few nice ones but I went pages without so much as a giggle. If you want Jewish humor or even soviet Jewish humor try out the 1981 book mentioned earlier.
3,"Great for collectors, but....","Overpriced. I only own this set because, twelve years ago, a local branch of a major retail chain had this mismarked with the ""1"" accidentally left off of the then-$150 price tag (then it became a heck of a deal!). You can pretty much get any of these songs on all of the other lower-priced Beatles CDs out there. There are, however, some great carrots for collectors in the form of the mono mixes, especially on the Magical Mystery Tour disc (which is actually presented in stereo AND mono).While the first seven discs contain widely-available mono mixes, the final eight discs contain mono tracks unavailable anywhere else. Some of these mixes are significantly different from the stereo mixes. This is nowhere more evident on ""I Am the Walrus"", in which the mono mix contains a couple of extra bars in the middle of the song.Over all, a ripoff for non-completists but almost worthwhile for obsessive collectors."
5,Beatles fan from day one,This box set is just as delightful as it was way back in the 60's when the Beatles hit the airwaves. Even the mono songs sound excellent! Packaging is not as important as what is inside the box. These songs brought back many fond memories and I would highly recommend it.
3,A Fair Movie,"Adam Beach fans will enjoy his charismatic portrayal of the memorable character Billy Little Plume. Otherwise, the predictable romance between the two leads is unconvincing; the use of foul language is excessive."
3,"Great reading, but not quite what I expected.","The book as such is absolutely gripping, and I also liked getting more background information. What I found rather annoying, though, is that some events in the book have nothing to do with the film. Where is the scene where Mellish gets knifed to death? And you're quite right when you claim that Panzer should be Panther (for a 'Panzer' is nothing but any type of tank.) Besides, both the German and the French lines had many spelling mistakes. Oh, come on, thousands of people are going to read this book, so they should have put a little more effort into that! But nonetheless I couldn't put the book down. Compelling."
2,Could not hold a candle to the movie.,"I really enjoyed Saving Private Ryan - the movie, but this book (evidently based on the screen play), read like a comic strip. I recommend just sticking with the excellent movie. For those who want to read an awesome WWII novel, check out ""The Thin Red Line"" by James Jones."
4,A quick and interesting read,"A good follow-on read to the movie but with one huge factual error. The author mistakes the shoulder patch of the 82nd ""All-American"" division with that of the 101st ""Screaming Eagles"". A scene in the book describes the ""double A"" of the 101st division's shoulder patch. The 82nd wear a ""double A"". The 101st, Pvt. Ryan's unit, wears an eagle on their shoulders.A small detail I know but abit startling none the less."
5,saving ryans private,Saving Private Ryan takes place at the beach at Normandy where many deaths occur.Seargent miller goes to find private ryan because his other brothers died in the war.He's the last of the brothers.They're taking him out of the war so his mother can see ryan.when you're watching the movie or reading the book you feel like you're there.It's so descriptive you actually know what the're going through. I recommend this book to anyone who likes war books and lots of gore and detail.I gave it five stars because its one of the best books i've ever read.I'll even give you a hint-the book has a lot more than the movie.
1,Yuck,If only this book had been written before the movie had been played; it seemed as though I was reading the script. The author neglected to go deeply into any of the characters and infact he just mentioned what the characters were thinking but it was relatively easy for a movie-watcher to pick up the thoughts of the soldiers. Read this ONLY if you haven't seen the movie.
1,Super Prism Review,"This is a terrible projector. It is extremely difficult to adjust and get at exactly the right distance. The lenses never focus at precisely the right distance. If I get it clear, it always seems to be projected at the wrong size. I am constantly switching back and forth between the two lenses with no luck. I always seem to be stacking books or getting chairs to prop my paper on to get the proper size. I had an older model Autograph that I lost in Katrina and would give anything to have it back."
2,fair,"Its ok for some things, but I haven't had a chance to use it enough yet to give a great review."
3,not bad but there are better documentaries,There are many documentaries out on Hitler and why Nazi Germany lost the war and this is just not among the better ones.
5,How Hitler LOST the WAR,"Actual World War 2 footage taken in Germany at this period. If YOU want a better understanding how Germany LOST the war, this DVD wil detail it. If YOUR into wanting to see some actual WW2 film, then buy this one."
3,Hitler's boo boos,"This documentary is worth watching for the viewer who is fairly new to the history of WWII. It gives a perspective showing how poor and quirky decisions made by Hitler fortunately cost Germany the war and gave the Brits the breaks they needed to rest, organize and fight another day with the Americans on board. For example,Goering's decision to halt the bombing of England came at a time when England's RAF was basically a day or two from no longer being an effective fighting force. The British ports were unprotected opening the way for a land invasion. Perhaps Hitler did lose Europe for the German military."
3,Old News,"There's nothing particularly wrong with this film, but anyone who is familiar with WWII history will not find anything new or different in it. It puts together all the well-known errors the Germans made to ""prove"" their point -- that the Allies didn't win the war as much as the Germans ""lost"" it. Someone who doesn't know much about the war to begin with might find this program interesting. For the rest, it will be less valuable, unless you are just looking for a ""review"" of things you already know."
4,Works great,I flat iron my iron almost everyday and this products makes it easier. I use it before blow-drying to lock in a straightener look. Leaves hair soft and manageable. Smells great just looks a little weird cuz the lotion is purple in color.
3,Mea Culpa... Gourmet is NOT Classic,"While this is a great knife, it was not at all what I was expecting. I have been buying Wusthof knives for my parents as gifts for years, but I procrastinated this year and instead going to my normal store, I bought the knife here online. Regrettably, I did not read the reviews beforehand to figure out that this is the lesser Gourmet line of Wusthof's knives.The knife is fine, and my mother - who does not care about name brands - was grateful as always. My only complaint is that the picture was misleading.I was expecting my normal Wusthof and was disappointed by the packaging and the ""stamp"" that was printed on the handle (instead of the normal ""W"" sticker). Alas, shame on me for not paying better attention. But Warren, you were right. I should have gone for the Classic line."
3,Casio watch,I own about 6 different types Casio watches. This one has some cool features. I like the solar charging and the automatic light. The only thing I didn't like about this watch is that its very bulky on small wrist.
3,Fun grindhouse movie,"I had fun with Nude Nuns with Big Guns. It's not great but delivers what it is supposed to. It's violent, has gratuitous nudity, a revenge plot and a cheap grimy feel. Unlike a lot of recent ""Grindhouse"" flicks, this one isn't a parody or homage. It's a cheaply made exploitation movie. It takes itself serious enough and doesn't wink at the camera. It is not a serious movie, but not a farce either. Grab some popcorn and other greasy food, throw down some shots and watch this enjoyable trash."
3,Senesless Sex and Violence - but is good for it's genre!,"If you like filthy hoes (disguised as actresses) spending most of their time naked, lesbian sex scenes, senseless violence and killing, and a clear attempt to defame Christianity - then this is for you!As is typical in today's climate, homosexuality is raised high, religion is pushed low. Sex and violence is the norm with these types of films, so that is no surprise. I just wonder how much they pay these filthy hoes. I am not Christian, but every ritual that they do, was defamed. Lesbianism between the nuns was normal. Then again, I always suspected them of being gay in real life anyway!If you like stupid, sex and violence with no purpose, then this is for you. I still do not know who the audience is for these types of films or why they make them, but I guess it is to poison the mind."
3,Not sure what to make of this,"It was either trying to be a naked nun sexploitation movie, or it was trying to be a serious murder-drug drama. It didn't really pull off either very well. It's not a bad movie. But it doesn't have much to redeem it either."
3,Not too bad at all...,"With a title like this you dont expect too much of a quality movie, but in fact this movie surprised me in a positive way. The camera work and editing is pretty good, the acting isn't bad at all and the story is uhm... well, its not too bad but its not great either. Action scenes are pretty fair and the whole thing is fairly believable. Better then expected!"
2,The Nudity Is The Only Good Thing,"Nude Nuns With Big Guns has only one thing going for it, and that is nudity. The nudity is good, but the story is mostly dull. And how can a movie with a title like this take itself seriously? I don't know, but Nude Nuns With Big Guns does take itself too seriously. I expected a campy good time, but what I got was a straight-faced action movie, and those are the worst kinds of action movies."
5,Grindhouse,"This movie is a ""Grind house"" masterpiece. The story line and the tone of the movie was on point with that of a ""Grind house"" film. There is plenty of nudity and a number of ""R"" rated scenes. Loved watching a raunchy movie for a change. Being that we're in the age of a kindergarten America. Wish there were more directors out there making films like this. The ""Grind house"" genre is awesome."
3,cheezeball western,"not a bad story, and acting was ok, but apparently i'm the only one who noticed some glaring out points with the sets. the poker scene...uhh...modern quarters, eisenhower dimes, and shiny new lincoln pennies? many buildings in town had sheets of plywood nailed on them? modern style hollow core doors on many of the buildings, and my favorite...the modern deadbolt locks and door knobs on most of the town's buildings! in one of the ending scenes of the big gunfight, you get a shot of a modern house off some distance from town, complete with white vinyl siding. i fully expected to see a car or truck drive by at any given time during the movie..."
5,Very good but very SAD movie,This poor lady gets gang raped after watching these men kill her 2 little boys and her police officer husband! It made me cry. They forced her husband to watch them gang raping her while he was dying. She got revenge though!
4,Not quite a remake but not bad for a direct to DVD,I saw it on Encore western so I saved the price of buying a copy but it isn't bad for a western made now of days. Reminds of Hannie Caulder from 1971 with Raquel Welch and Robert Culp who was the bounty hunter who taught her to be a gunfighter after saveing her from thugs. If you can get Hannie Caulder and watch them back to back they were both good flims. A friend gave me a copy he bought from Wallmart so I can't complain. It's good and a bit offesive at the start but they want you to depise the villans and cheer for the heroine as she hunts down and kills thos who murderd her husband and children then gang raped her. the only changes to me were minor.
1,Waste of Time,"This one was seriously bad. Laughably bad. Problem was, the director was going for serious. That kind of bad. Bad casting, bad acting, bad sets, and bad writing. Only redeeming quality was a plot twist at the end (that's why I gave it one star). And because Sage Mears was cute (when she was trying to act tough)."
2,Hmmm,"Well, I guess this type of thing is just not for me. I mean whether the man was gentle with her or not is not the point, he was still degrading her, especially at the end at the party with his friends. And the female was WAY too accepting of what he wanted from her! I mean eating after him and having to kneel while he ate, and then tying her up all night long while she had her menstrual time! COme on!!! There was no romance, not even the slightest bit, in this story. Perhaps my expectations in this were off as this was my first BDSM type book."
1,Yawn,This novel put me to sleep three nights in a row. These characters wer so blah I could not enjoy the book at all. There was no attraction between them so it left me cold. Try Wicked Ties by Shayla Black for a hot bdsm novel with a passionate couple.
2,Too noisy for constant use,"This wick/fan based humidifier is much noisier than my old ultrasonic mist based humidifier. The noise level even on low is too loud. Forget about sleeping in the same room with this thing if it's set to high. The wick filter also gets dirty and smelly really fast if you don't clean it constantly. On the plus side, the water tank is big (3 gallons) and there is an auto on/off based on ambient humidity."
1,Antimicrobial? Stay far away!,It's well established that the overuse of antimicrobial treatments is leading to the development of dangerous resistant bacteria that pose a threat to the environment and to human health. You can do your small part to fight this trend by buying one of the many equivalent products that don't come with an antimicrobial treatment.
4,Holmes Wick Humidifier filter.,"This item is a replacement filter for my cool mist room humidifier. It's exactly what came with the humidifier, but requires frequent maintenance. It needs to be removed and washed ever week or it becomes crusted and no longer usefull. This information is not given with the initial purchase of the humidifier or the replacement units. Otherwise the filter will only last two to three weeks. I can get closer to six weeks use of the filter media."
1,good price but didnt last long,This unit was cheaper than the others available on amazon but turned yellow and started emitting an odor within a few days. I guess you get what you pay for...
2,"Do not buy, this filter is cheap and only lasts 1 month max.","I should have listened to other reviewers, this filter, at least mine, felt cheap, after only 2-3 weeks of use I tried to clean it gently and the whole filter fell apart under luke warm tap water. QC needs to be alerted to the horrible quality of these filters. I can't afford to be buying a new one every couple weeks. The original filter that came with my unit was much more durable."
2,flimsy,"I had bought this filter from Bed Bath and Beyond before and I don't remember it being so flimsy. Every time I cleaned the humidifier, I found tiny pieces that broke from the black mesh on the outside. I have only used it for a month and the whole filter is on the verge of falling apart."
1,Rotted within 2 weeks,I own Sunbeam's humidifier and had used authentic Subbeam filters in it before and they worked as expected. This product is either fake or seriously flawed. The filter started catching fungus and rotted just within 2 weeks of use!
2,Made Cheaply,"I have bought this filter before - this one seems cheaply made & is already deteriorating, after one round of use."
4,Works as expected,I replace this filter once or twice per season (Depending on how dry it's been). It's definitely worth replacing the filter when it's dirty and it's the best humidifier that I've used to date.
5,Humidifier Filter,Bought this for use with my Sunbeam humidifier because I couldn't find any replacement filters at Walmart that were the correct size. Fits perfectly and works just as described.
4,"Filters Air, Adds Humidity. What more can I ask?","This filter works pretty well. This filter even has Arm & Hammer baking soda in it so it gets rid of odors as well as adding humidity and filtration. Lasts long enough to make it through the season and then some with my amount of usage. Its nothing special, but gets the job done as advertised."
5,Needed replacement,This is a replacement filter for a humidifier we have and it works as good as the original. Hopefully this one will last a couple years like the original.
4,Holmes HWF62PDQ-U Humidifier Filter,"No fault of the filter. Its does its job.. But when you store your humidifier, the filter is usually useless to use again once it dries. It gets out of shape and discolors. Still, I like the filter option and when I purchase through Amazon, I normally buy two as the humidifier does not function without it because the vapors are drawn through the filter."
2,Generic,While the filter we received works with the Holmes humidifier it was a generic and not Holmes brand as title and description suggests. I just want to get what I paid for and expect.
4,Good OEM replacement filter.,It's a replacement filter for a fairly good humidifier. Not much to review about besides that. Just be sure you buy the right size! Double-check the compatible models. I accidentally bought the wrong one and had to return and re-buy. The pictures can be hard to guesstimate with the lack of scale--so double check the models!
2,not the brand name Holmes,"This filter does not seem to work as well as the Holmes brand. I did not think it would make a difference, but the dial does not seem to return to the middle of the good area since the filer was changed. I have washed the unit numerous times, but it does not seem to make a difference."
3,it's a filter,"It seems to match the original filter, which is good. Took 2 weeks to arrive, and s&h was expensive, so that's bad."
5,great style of life,"I have a hard time with the dry air on winter (heat) and also on summer (air condition) so this humidifier filter its great and keeps the air the way I really need. great seller, delivered within days from the puschase day.thank you very much"
4,This is a good filter,"This filter does a great job with my older Holmes humidifier. A bit expensive here on Amazon's website, as I found it at Holmes' website for a lower price even paying for shipping. I normally love buying through Amazon, but I didn't want to buy 3 filters just to get the free shipping. I normally get through a northeast winter using 2-3 of these filters and it really helps minimize the static electric shocks from the carpet and sofa. I just wish there was a way to wash these filters so I could save some money. :-)"
2,Machinery failure analysis and troubleshooting,Good for product plant analyzer to monitor its unit defect
2,stay away from this product,"forget the nice packaging, you get the tubes of gel in a plastic bag with a rubber band around it.Attempted to return and received a dismissive NO, complained direct to Amazon and received refund next day!Definitely not as advertised."
1,"Product description is false, do not buy","Product description is false, do not buy this product. I purchased this product thinking it was the ZOOM product that is sold at my dentists office and for the price i was willing to take the change. It is not the same product, this is the Philips version of the ZOOM day white gel. It has a faulty container, when you cap and store it the syringe leaks while the cap on it. I knew i was taking at chance at this cost. Do not buy if your are looking for the original ZOOM product."
2,Ouch!,"I've used the lower dosage version of this product for a few years after getting started with it at the dentist's office. The whitening results are great, but after using this 9.5% gel for 20 minutes, I experienced intense, shooting pain in one tooth and had to remove the product before the recommended minimum of 30 minutes. It's strange because I do have one particular tooth that is quite sensitive, but that one did not bother me at all during the treatment and a tooth that has never bothered me reacted so strongly. I plan to continue using the 9.5% product in shorter intervals and hope to prevent further pain/sensitivity, but this may not result in good whitening.In the future I will stick to the 7.5% strength, which caused only mild sensitivity with use. If you have sensitive teeth, you should definitely go with the weaker solution."
4,Day white excel,"This is same product I bought from my dentist but half the price.I think it does a good job.You are able to control the amount of whitening by choosing when to stop when your teeth look the way you want.You do not get that artificial,chicklet look like can happen with the one time dentist whitening.The only downside is it slow and takes several weeks to get good results."
5,Discus Dental owned by Philips Oral Care,"I normally get this from my dentist but thought I'd see if it was available online. I was very confused by all these reviews stating that this is not by Discus but a Philips product and it wasn't as good. After researching this, I found that Discus Dental is now owned by Philips Oral Care. If you google Discus Dental or Daywhite ACP it takes you to the Philips webpage. At the bottom of the page is a line that says ""Discus Dental is now part of Philips Oral Healthcare"". Hope this clears up all this confusion. I'm placing my order today.BTW- on the Philips website they show the old Discus packaging has been replaced by the new Zoom packaging. Same product. Does old packaging mean old product?"
2,Phillips Zoom,"I have to say I did not receive the Day White Excel by Discus Dental, which is an excellent product.Instead they sent me Phillips Zoom which is not as good. The Day White Excel is by far the greatest!!!!"
1,Be Aware Product Burns Gums,"I have been in dentistry for 17 years, so have some knowledge on tooth whitening. I normally buy the Nite White Excel for whitening my teeth, but thought I would try this product. Worst product ever. I tried it the first time 3 months ago and a few minutes after inserting, in my special trays I made myself, the product started burning my gums, I took it out and washed off the product from my teeth. I tried again the next day and again after a few minutes it started burning again. So I went back to the old product Nite White which I had a little of, but it was out of date and so when I used it, nothing happened to whiten my teeth. Yesterday, I tried again and after putting trays in it burned a little but left them in 45 minutes, when I took them out my gums were bleeding and raw, today they are raw and purple, now they will need a few days to heal hopefully back to their natural healthy state. I will never use this product again."
2,Not a Various Artists Compiliation,"I love various artists compiliations and I love New Age music. This album is really one artist (or rather a duo), named Glenn D. Wright & R. Arduini, who appear to be keyboardists / sythesizer artists. All the tracks sound alike. The tracks are pleasant enough, or to quote Douglas Adams, they are ""mostly harmless."" I did not discover this until it was too late to return, as it was part of about 20 albums that I received for Christmas. Anyway, it is not as advertised. No variety. As a previous reviewer said (twice), it is good music to go to sleep by."
3,Good theoretical approach to understanding social systems,"Banathy's A systems view of education is a good set of theoretical lenses for understanding educational systems. The three lenses help educators understand an educational system as it changes through time, as it functions, and in relation to its environment, which is a real contribution to the field. The book tries to help you learn to apply the lenses as you go, but it will probably be tough going for all but the most courageous of readers. It does, however make a good resource for a class which is designing and ed. system. A little more palatable text and actual examples from the real world would make this a 5 star book."

2,Lincoln Logs Commemorative Tin,"While the Lincoln Logs are the same well-made log pieces that we all remember, and the tin can container is familiar to the nostalgic buyer, the contents are very disappointing. The large can holds a great deal of cardboard and very few Lincoln Logs. It's a good thing I ordered some ""people"" and props from the company to give my grandson along with this surprisingly limited amount of logs."
1,weak,"I have to agree with the number of reviews against this mouse. It has been nothing but problematic since I purchased it 5 months ago. I have had to reset it multiple times and thinking changing out the batteries would work has cost me multiple sets of batteries. I have only used it on a mouse pad, I have been delicate, I haven't abused it, but tomorrow, I am buying a new mouse."
1,Don't buy it..,"I got this mouse for Christmas, the design looks nice and the grips feel good but it took a lot of frustration to figure out why it wasn't working. The battery compartment doesn't close all the way, you have to keep pushing it and hope it stays or else the mouse dies. Also, after about 2 months of use, the middle scroll button screwed up. It scrolls by itself randomly and if you try to use it, it just goes nuts. I switched it back to my old dell ball mouse, at least my old mouse works :/"
1,Disappointed over failure,We bought this mouse about 4 months ago and it has apparently failed. The laser no longer fires up when connected. Before it failed we liked its performance and fact it has no on/off switch while still not running batteries down.We will go to another brand.
3,Works ok but doesn't have the range I would like,"We purchased this item to control a laptop from about 7 feet away for use when using the laptop connected to the TV to play movies. It really doesn't work at that range. it might work just fine up close, but I haven't tried. I don't recommend it for long distances."
4,Woulda been a 5 star if ....,"I like some others bought from big lots at $13. Love it. Got the MP2000WU model and I see there are bigger and better ones out there. No problem with the battery case or the batteries going dead, very smooth, love the scroll, the feel, and it works PERFECT on my cpu. On my laptop however, it seems to disconnect at times and the worst was when I got an error message to shut down. I have the generic driver installed and do not seem to find anything better for it even on microsoft and cnet, which turned out to be a waste of time for both. I have XP, not Vista. So there you have it. Enjoy!"
2,XP or older,I looked through the description to not find what OS it worked for. Mice are Mice...right? Wrong? It doesn't work on Vista. For $8 it's a good buy but they should have put the OS it works on in the description. Now I need to pawn it off on someone who can use it.
1,Don't buy,"We are slow learners. This is our third wireless mouse from Gear Head & the last. I ordered from Amazon on 10/20, received on 10/27, installed on 10/28 & the battery cover fell off in my hand within two minutes of use. I cannot tape it back together so the unit is a total loss.Gear Head insists we pay postage to return.I believe that I will simply fold my tent & shop another brand of wireless mouse."
1,Dont do it,"It doesnt work on Vista? so it was designed to work on XP a 10 yr old OS? they mention no website on the product packaging. I found it and it has zero info or support. This chinese junk no one in the world would buy, except US. Stay away from any gearhead products."
2,Eats Batteries and I think it just internally exploded,"I also bought this at Big Lot's. It seemed to work fine for a few months, but as I was using it one day I heard a loud POP! Now the optical light won't come on and it's dead. Wondering if anyone else has had this experience..."
1,OK if you dont know anything about cars,I recently purchased this manual for my 1979 GMC Caballero. It really only gives basic and General information about the vehicle..... If you have had shop class or have worked on Chevys before this manual is a waste of time and money. I just ordered a factory service manual they are very detailed and explicit and contain information that is pertiant to your model instead a generalization like Haynes.... Haynes has few diagrams and illustrations are often of a different model with a different part....If your an novice this book might be ok but if you wanna know the extra I would recomend the factory service manual it cant be beat.
3,Basic Basic Basic,"69-87 says it all, how can you fit any real info in a paperback an inch thick? Buy a book that is very specific to your year check here, ebay and take a ton of pictures before to help with the after."
4,"Useful for the restorer, the maintainer or the new owner","Back in high school I had a 1973 Chevelle Malibu Classic 4 Door (that's right, a 4-door). It had the 454 big block V8, and I got it at a time when only 4 of the 8 cylinders would fire. This manual talked me through all variety of diagnosing problems, troubleshooting and basic repairs. It had sections on body work, on tools required, on electrical wiring, and all variety of necessary information. Could not have been simpler if I were a mechanic. I highly recommend any and all of these books for any vehicle. When I bought a Nissan pickup in 1990, my first auto-related purchase was the Haynes manual for the truck. And I found it to be similarly helpful. I had that truck for seventeen years because of the care with which I was able to maintain the vehicle from the information in that manual."
5,the right belt,I got what I ordered in a timely matter. Also I was very pleased with the price comparison. I would recommend this site to anyone who needed help.
1,Broke my momentum,Belts kept snapping and spun the brush so fast it melted the plastic holding the sides of the brush in the vacuum. Now I have to replace the brush and buy more belts. My users manual has that I should be using Bissell part number 32074 so I'm not really sure why this part did not function correctly.
5,There when I needed it!,Thanks for sending this so fast! Nothing worse than needing your vacuum and not being able to use it! Thanks again!!
5,It works.,It does what it's supposed to do. Installed on my Bissell and ran without a hitch. That's all that really matters with this product.
1,Bogus quality of BISSEL Style 7/9/10 belts sold by Vacbelts.com,"Recently I purchased the product BISSEL Style 7/9/10 Replacement Belts from Vacbelts.com through Amazon. There were 2 belts in the pack. The first belt broke after vacuuming for 10 minutes and then the second belt broke after less than a minute of service. Considering these performance statistics, there is no point in commenting on the quality of these belts. I have wasted both my time and money in ordering these belts from Vacbelts.com.BISSELL Style 7/9/10 Replacement Belts, 2 pk, 32074"
5,belts,"great belts designed the way it was speced out, cleans and filters very cleanly. A-plus, A-plus. best product out there."
1,Not what I received,"I received belts for a Hoover vacuum, so of course they did not fit on my vacuum. Better luck next time."
5,One of the least overlooked parts on a vacuum.,"If you have a vacuum cleaner that doesn't seem to be working as it used to, try flipping it over, clean the clumps of hair that are wrapped around the beater bar, and replace the drive belt. Unless your vacuum has some other internal mechanical problem, this will almost always make the vacuum run like new.The drive belt on our Bissell was still intact, but had slackened enough to slip when in use. I purchased a new drive belt, and when I installed it, I also eliminated a salon's worth of hair from around the beater bar. That, and cleaning the miscellaneous filters on the vacuum all made for a noticeable increase in power. Now our Bissell sucks...in a good way."
4,Vacuum cleaner belts,"I found this to be a good deal on a 2-pak of drive belts. I would give the product 5 stars except that these belts were a little smaller than the original one I replaced. Granted, the original belt probably stretched a bit over the years, and it was extensively cracked, but the new belt took some stretching to get the beater-bar back in place. And these belts don't stretch that easily. The vacuum appears to be functioning perfectly with this new belt, so I do recommend this item, just beware that installation takes a bit of strength to accomplish."
5,Works great!,"Does its job, decent price, and hard to find in the store. I'm happy I could find this online. Our vacuum works great now."
4,Worked fine for my Bissell Momentum,"The fan belt for my Bissell Momentum broke when a huge carpet furball got caught in the fan intake. This belt worked fine for the replacement. Nothing fancy, just a fan belt."
5,Bissell 32074 Style 7 Drive Belt,"Just the right price, reasonable shipping time, and a perfect fit! Vaccum works like new again. Will certainly purchase again as the need arises. Can you believe, suggestions are that one should replace these belts every six months? Not sure how long these will last but my guess is it will be longer than 6 months."
2,replacement belt,"I purchased a #9 drive belt and instead I received a #7 drive belt. Will have to return, won't fit my vacuum."
1,wrong size?,this belt ruined my Bissell Helix brush dowel now I must buy a new one. burned and snapped right off. this belt is just too tight a fight. order the specific style 9 drive belt.
2,it would be ok if it was why I order,its say for models 7 9 and 10 i got model 12 and it was not bissel what i recive it was some other brand and of course DID NOT FIT !!! BUT IT WOULD TAKE ME MORE TIME TO GO TO THE POST OFICE AND EXVCHANGE IT
3,Very poor,You sent me 2 Hoover belts. Not 2 Bissel belts. So I am obviously not happy. I'm not sure what happened.
3,Priced Right,The price was right (for 2 !) and fast delivery via USPS. Product is about 1/2 inch bigger around than the original that was on the vacuum (Powerforce 6584)but it works. Only vacuumed four times with it so far and it seems to be fine. I read others say it broke or burned up but you should be able to tell by the way it fits the first time if it will work or not. Just make sure you put it on correctly to you model.
5,"Excelent voice, the start of another legend",The only short coming is there is not enough of Sheila Raye. She has one of those voices you could set back and lose time in. She is an example of the fruit not falling far from the tree. I can't wait til she does another CD.
2,Just the Facts: Scientifc Revolution,"I didn't like this video. Their experts are uninteresting to listen to and the music is terrible! I had hoped to be able to use it in class, but my students would fall asleep."
3,It's Okay,"I bought this DVD to show my ""B"" level World History students. They were totally lost. The music was a bit loud and the audio was a bit too soft. It moved rather quickly which made it even harder for them to follow. This series is good for the teacher to watch, but it is a bit too thick for freshmen. I also recommend it for European AP students and college students taking European History."
1,Bad Product,This was the worst construction of a pet dish. It's not stainless steel as they claimand it is dangerous for your pet. Extremely poor design. Should be taken off the market.I wouldn't even rate it (1) start -0-+:-(
4,"Great Quality, Not-for Traveling Lightly","Great product for occasional use with heavier cameras and lenses, wouldn't recommend for traveling with frequently."
4,Great Pan Tilt Head,"Bought this to replace an older 3030. It is lighter, the handles are shaped better for comfort and the quick release works much easier. Only suggestion would be to design it to tilt upward more than 30 degrees. Not an important requirement but might be useful to have in some situations, like architectural photos."
2,Quick release problem,"As with another reviewer, the quick release is a problem. It gets jammed and I can't get the camera off, except after several minutes of pushing and pulling. No confidence in this head. Otherwise it works fine..."
4,"Great, if you know what you want","This is a fairly heavy head and I would not want to be lugging it through the mountainous backwoods. However, if that is not your shtick then this could be perfect for you. Manfrotto doesn't have the cache of some other heads but it doesn't come with the insanely high price tag either. I am a little clumsy and I like levers as opposed to knobs. I also like having three levers as opposed to one knob. This is perfect for me. The motion is very smooth and I have no problems tracking birds in flight. The quick release plate works well. You can spend a lot more and get a lot less."
3,Haven't used it emough to recommend,So far I really do like this head but time will tell...I need to work with it more...My daughter got a used tripod and head that makes me really envious ...Time will tell
1,DO NOT BUY MANFROTTO 808RC4 3-Way Head,"You can't get your camera off the darn head. I had this Manfrotto 808-RC4 3-way head for a year and had nothing but trouble with it. I would spend several minutes while my clients would be standing there waiting for me while the so-called ""quick release"" lever jammed and wouldn't let me remove my camera. It's so aggravating and embarrassing when a piece of junk like this completely ruins your work flow. There were a few times I actually had to remove the head completely in order to get the camera off of it. Ridiculous!!!The other night it jammed and the doggone lever fell off! I had little springs and ball bearings flying everywhere. Not pretty.Now the head is useless. It's only one year old and it not only caused me countless headaches, embarrassment, and aggravation until it finally fell apart in my hands.I cannot say enough bad about this product. Manfrotto should be ashamed!!!STAY AWAY!!!DO NOT BUY MANFROTTO 808RC4 3-Way Head."
5,"Lived up to all the hype, on why this Book is the Bible of BMW","Excellent Book,was as advertised-delivered to me in their time frame-this is the Book for BMW fans,Specs plus excellent Pictures, i am a happy consumer."
2,Not good picture quality,This DVD might be interesting to those wishing to visit Yosemite one day and o some decent help in touring the park but THE PICTURE QUALITY STINKS and is very outdated.Those that want information on the park then this dvd is very informative. But those that want good picture quality then look elsewhere. It's a shame because alot of the filiming and shots very very good but the picture was faded and old looking.If you want to buy it then buy it on VHS and save the money. This one was not of any digital DVD standard. Alot of menus and chapters to go through but that's it. Picture never improves.Looks like a 60's video.
1,Poor Print Quality,"This review and rating refers to the physical quality of the book, not to the content quality. It seems the book currently published by Norton is a poor quality photocopied version of the book. The diagrams with the grey backgrounds are really bad. I understand that the technology that was used to originally publish the book is obsolete but that does not excuse the current poor quality reproductions.Although Norton is the only publisher of this title, the other titles in the series are also available from another publisher although I cannot confirm if the print quality is any better."
3,disappointingly wishy-washy,"I must reluctantly agree with ""A Customer"" that this collection does not exactly shine against the rest of Schwartz's work. I should point out that I have quite the library of Judaica, including just about everything penned by Schwartz, Ginzberg, Patai, Frankel, Noy, and whomever else. This book feels like Schwartz is starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel and is resultantly coming up with tales that are--how shall I put it--dull? vapid? lackluster? trivial? Granted, one cannot always ""discover"" yet another several hundred breathtaking tales (one is reminded of the clever Zipes playing impresario to the dubiously prolific Gonzenbach), but I really get the impression that Schwartz just permitted his discard pile to grow until there were enough snips and snails to whip up a ""book."" No, feel quite free to pass on this minor entry: you won't miss it."
3,Ok,"This book was ok but there was too much ""trying to convince me"". The first 9 chapters are on why to not use antibiotics. The last chapter is on how to treat ear infections without antibiotics, I just wanted a little more on the treating and not so much on the convincing."
3,"antibiotic overuse, low-cost wellness techniques","If you know nothing about the negative consequences of antibiotics, this would be a useful and informative book, or if you have questions about dietary modifications for your child to help reduce their risk of getting ear infection/inflammation. I found the book is somewhat repetitive, and it probably is preaching to the converted. I bought it because I wanted to know the massage techniques for draining the lymph system, and they take up a scant few pages at the very end of the book. I would have liked more of the hands-on information and less of the reasons why antibiotic overuse is bad."
2,Amoxicillin,This Amoxicillin worked well on my child with allergies and colds - not too sure the other things would really work on kids that had ear aches - Know I needed antibiotics for my ear ache as a kid & have not had other problems = Have not seen/heard anything like this Dr. says that would work = Why put a kid through this terrible pain at all if the antibiotics work right away!
1,Copy of faded original,This book appears to be a photocopy of a very faded original. The printing is very light and difficult to make out and in some instances has faded altogether.
3,fits 2002 camry well; not so much avalon 2007,"based on ""does it fit your car"" information from the amazon purchasing web site, i bought two of these cabin filters.The first one I installed in my 2002 Camry XLE 6 cylinder fit just fine.The second one I installed had to jammed into the slot on my 2007 Avalon limitedbecause it was slightly wider than the slot (the other side of the rectangular filterwas even wider); the filter is also not as high as the OEM filter.Not worth the hassle of returning, but be wary of ""does it fit"" info."
1,Air Filter Review,"I'm sure the filter is fine for its intended application. I would caution prospective buyers to double check the part compatibility against the manufacturers website. This does not fit the 2006 Avalon that the Amazon claims. Fortunately, I was able to 'trim to fit'.-Martin"
2,Didn't fit perfectly for '05 Camry,"Very good materials, however it was a really tight fit for an '05 Camry. Also there are small gaps between the filter and filter tray once installed. However, applying tape to cover the small gap worked. I won't be getting this again, however because it wasn't a perfect fit."
3,"good as you remember, but...","Good as you remember, but definitely they should have done something to clean up the video. Every release of a classic on DVD gets cleaned up, why not this? The video is unclean, in most episodes the color is washed out. If you buy it, you will see what I mean. It is disappointing that they released it in this state. Only your love for the series saves it. Anybody seeing for the first time will not endure watching a full episode."
4,For Robotech Fans,"I have been looking forward to this set for a while. It brought back some great memories of the past. There were a number of shourt comings with the set. Why have commercial breaks? The extra DVD could have had some other features (widescreen, web site, etc.)I would recommend it to other Robotech fans."
5,I love this animated series!,"I got these after getting a DVD player for Christmas. I loved watching these shows growing up and they are still fun today. I didn't notice any quality issues with the discs. Nobody that I have lent the set to have mentioned anything other than they enjoyed watching them. Also I thought the extra disk that has some interesting footage related to the series was pretty cool, nothing too special though."
3,DVD Quality is Poor,"Loved having it on DVD, but unfortunately they had the same quality as my old VHS tapes (Direct from video master). Will wait for rest of Robotech Macross (26 espsodes by the way) series patiently and hope they also release Southern Cross and New Generation too. Wished they cleaned up the master they used like Animego is doing for the original Anime version master of Macross. Maybe someone will clean the DVD version of Robotech Macross and sell copies of it on eBay.:-)"
2,Good Series - Bad DVD,"If I am going to pay serious cash for a DVD boxed set, I want a DVD quality picture. I have seen a restored portion of this series and it is great. I would'nt buy a bunch of DVDs where the picture is worse than a VHS tape."
2,Decepcion,"The laser disc version is much better than this one. The laser disc version has closed caption, and the audio is far superior than this one."
1,A true Macross fan? Don't bother. A robotech fan? Sure.,"Originally I had high hopes for this set, after all they used the name Macross on the title. However after popping the DVD in I was severely disappointed. Not only is the childish dubbing still present, it is also the cut, convulated American version. You see ""Robotech"" is a whole bunch of Macross sagas tied together for America messing up alot of the story line.If you are interested in the original and pure version you are better off buying the AnimEigo versions, they don't have any special features but it is the true vision of Macross."
1,Big Dissappointment,"I had fond memories of this series from back in the 80's when it aired on TV. I must've been expecting too much, because I was totally unimpressed with the boxed set. The colors were washed out, and the annoying, repetitive music really started to grate on my nerves after the first two episodes.I would have also been much happier if they had left out the opening/closing credits for EACH episode (with accompanying annoying music), as well as the 3-5 min recap of the previous episode. Maybe they left this in out of laziness, or to pad the DVD's with garbage so they could stretch the series across more disks.Simple changes could have made this so much better."
2,Where's the Vapors?,"What ever happened to the vaporizors we had when I was a kid? The kind where a big puff of mist came out over your head while you were sleeping? I bought this machine to use at night with menthol vapors for colds. This vaporizor takes 10 minutes to even start working, and when it does, a tiny thin line of smoke-style vapor that is barely visible comes rising up--but only a few inches before falling. Not enough to fill a room, let alone a sleeping area. You have to put your face directly over the machine to even get the effects. You can put menthol liquid in the reservoir, but it holds only a very small amount and the reservor it is slanted in a way that makes it drip all over the place and run down the machine. It is a very quiet machine--can't really hear it run at all. I don't know if this is how they are all made now, but it sure wasn't what I expected."
5,Fantastic Ella!,"What can be said about this phenomenal artist that has not been said already? It has always puzzled me how this lady could be making Art with capital letters, just by so effortlessly opening her mouth and letting her genius come out. She sings so naturally, so effortlessly and so wonderfully. She gives me goose bumps."
5,Wonderful book,"Very thoughtful and encouraging book! Separated out into different months, excellent prayer time with baby! Also includes development."
4,"Good Product, Nice Aroma","Bought this to use in our Hot Springs Spa. Adds a nice scent which lasts for maybe two days. Doesn't take much, maybe a couple of tablespoons for our 5 person tub. Dissolves well, doesn't leave any negative effects on the tub."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING THIS BOOK,"This book came out in 1990. I was 10. My mother jumped at this book and made me read it or the Bible and re-write exerpts as punishment everytime I did something wrong. Notice: these manners were not TAUGHT, they were ENFORCED upon as punishment. The mere sight of this book upsets me to no end. PLEASE. Use this book as a reference as to how manners/table settings/letter writing/conversations are supposed to be used, but do not use it as a tool to punish your children. Discuss what is in the book - make it fun, make it interactive - as a supplement to good parenting. Please don't use it as a tool/babysitter to help raise your child because you're too lazy to teach them yourself.I also don't like reading the Bible as an adult, either."
1,fun fun fun,"i hate thins book. we had it once. it didnt stand a chance. me and my brothers and some of our freinds totaly destroyed it. we tore it, threw it against a nail in the wall, hid it under stuffed animals and put it in the cieling. we still cant find it, even though we did this years ago. heh heh heh...."
1,Worst watch I've ever bought,"Let me start by saying, it looks good... in the picture. When I received this watch the first thing that struck me was how cheap the build quality was. The band was mostly plastic and even the bezel around the dial was plastic. Speaking of which, after 3 days of use the plastic around the dial fell off on it's own. I couldn't find it since I was walking so now I have an even uglier watch. The only thing I really like about it is the dial itself, but that's not the reason I bought it. If I hadn't tossed away the packaging I would have returned this watch on the first day of ownership."
5,Love this CD!,Laurie Beechman had an amazing voice. It's so sad that she died from cancer with so much potential ahead for her. I own several of her CDs but this one is the best.
1,Broke after little use.,"I think I used it twice and ""reverse"" is broken and won't ratchet, it just spins (both directions). Too bad I learned this after the return window."
1,Not well made?,"Received the 3/8"" Stanley ratchet today and the quick release button (mechanism)was missing.Amazon is replacing it tomorrow, but that doesn't change the fact that I received a new defective product from Stanley."
1,Just a pamphlet,"I bought this hoping to add to my book collection of gemstone lore. I found it lacking in substance. It's a good beginning book for young readers interested in gemstones, but other than that, not that useful."
2,Music not included,"It's not very clear from the description, but unfortunately this book does NOT include the songs/music, nor does it let you know where these are available, so as such, it isn't really that useful if you want to put on the play...you will need to source the music elsewhere."
5,Lots to Explore on this CD-ROM,"This is an excellent Mahjongg program. It includes MANY tilesets and backgrounds, and if you have even a basic understanding of a program such as Paint Shop Pro or Adobe Photoshop, you can create customized tilesets with just a bit of time and patience. If you like Mahjongg, this is one to buy!"
1,Fairly sad,It's hard to imagine that this software might have once been something like state of the art. It is so slow and dreadful looking as to be very close to worthless. Even under $10 it is a waste of time and money. Too bad.
5,"Great Item, you will not be sorry","These chairs are so much better than they appear in the photo. They are quality pieces of furniture. I was not sure about the quality when I ordered them being the price is so low, but upon receipt, they are great chairs. The quality surpasses the chairs I looked at when I was at Ikea. The material is quality and the chairs are upholstered correctly. The cherry wood legs are solid and have a great finish on them. The assembly was easy, everything was labeled and enclosed. We have been very happy with our purchase and could not have gotten a better deal!"
2,Not the quality I expected..but,These chairs are very nice looking but did not have the quality and weight for our dining table and my husband did a thumbs down. The construction - not well built. BUT I did take these chairs to my office (college) where we needed a smaller chair in the waiting area - and college students aren't particular. Great alternative.
1,Poor,Product looks great but while putting them together the wood of the chairs split. They are damaged! Unable to use. No return receipt was with them.
2,Impossible to assemble some chairs properly,"Out of 6 chairs, 3 could not be assembled properly. Three of the chairs were easy to assemble, requiring less than ten minutes per chair. One of the chairs was impossible to assemble properly because the holes were so poorly aligned. I had to re-drill the holes, and even then the supplied bolts were too short to reach. The other two chairs also had holes that did not line up, but it was too much effort to re-drill the holes, so I just left the bolts off them. So now they are a bit wobbly.The materials appear pretty cheap, and I have doubts about their longevity. They look OK, and are reasonably comfortable, but don't think you're getting a great deal with these chairs. You're probably better off trying to get some better quality chairs off Craigslist or somesuch.My chairs did not have nasty smell that others have mentioned. However, several of the hardware bags had been opened, such that the bolts and washers were strewn about at random."
2,You get what you pay for...,Purchased these chairs for the new dining room table. I loved the look and the color is what I wanted but the quality is very cheap. They are very light weight. I feel like you can just walk by and it will tip over. Some of the chairs legs are uneven and wabble. One of the chairs doesn't glide when you push in the chair you actually have to tilt it back in order to push it. It's gets caught on the rubber on the bottom leg. Will have to see how the cushion on the chairs last. It's only been a few days since we started using them. Also the faux lether is poor quality as well. These will have to do until I can purchase better ones. Buyer be ware you get what you pay for.
3,good not great,"I had the EP for this CD,and I liked it enough to get the full album.If you like Saigon Kick you will probally like this.S K is better,but for the price it's worth getting,there are some very good songs,and some that are just ok.But again the price is worth it."
2,where's the brief,I couldn't wait to get this book. I really like this groupf of bulbs and I wanted to learn more about growing them and the varieties I could grow and the work being done with them. Well I was in for a surprise. this book does little of that. What it does do is give the reader the history of the plant and its introduction into horticulture. The work that went into it is staggeringbut nothing for the gardener. Infact after reading it I don't think the authors even grow the plants it is treated as more of an object than a plant. this was made worse by no color photos just illustrations. now don't get me wrong they were nice illustrations. but would it have killed you to include some photos. I can onot reccomend this to any gardener unless you are really into botanic history.
4,Read Instructions before installing.,"Overall this system works very well. Understand there are 4 brackets that look very similar. There are actually three different parts. One for front left, one for front right, and the other two are identical for the back bar. Easiest install is with two people so you don't have to play tug and war and not pull the foot pad out of place. The 400XT system once you have tighten the feet down and locked in place. Drive around, best with a load on top for a few hours and check to see if it loosed up. If it has, tighten so it's snug. The new Rapid Aero Foot system has a Torque indicator built in the clamp system to tell you when it's tight enough to eliminate that step as well as not to over tighten system and not bend the bracket. Most likely depending on the aerodynamics of your car, I would recommend an Air Foil. Make sure it's the size for your vehicle/bar length. If your using longer bars than recommended, go with the wider fairing."
1,GO TO WALL MART,Buy a 60 ounce 2X concentrate at Wall Mart for $17.99. Don't buy this and get ripped off for the cost and shipping.If you notice the advertisements do not put the size you are buying in the add. You have to zoom in on the screen and hope you can read it.
3,"Okay, but will try Hoover next time.",I bought this because of the Scotchguard. My dog had messed up my carpets badly. I used this and it worked okay. I was not impressed. I could not smell any sent in the formula which disappointed me.
1,Never delivered.,"I cannot comment on the product as it was never delivered. It has been over 30 days since ordered. Made contact with True Value, but still no product. They say it's being shipped. Reminds me of ""The check is in the mail"" answer given when it not true. I have ordered hundreds of items from different vendors, and this has been the worst. I doubt that I will ever order any thing from True Value again."
2,Smells horrible,This is supposed to get rid of the odors not create more. Don't like the smell this leaves in my carpets.
5,Miller should be lionized,"Miller, as all know,is a national treasure. No one I know could have made this subject breathe nearly two centuries later. I wonder if anyone else could have guessed the importance of the subject.Miller gets in the mind(s) of his (historical) characters better than anyone else. He is always a good read; deep, colorful, poignant. He is a national treasure."
4,"Interesting topic, well done.","Deals with an issue I was not familiar with, and illustrates an interesting political waltz in the 1830's and 1840's. Helped me understand better some issues in that period."
3,"Hey, it was made in 1996. Give some props!!!!!!","It's just a clssic little cd full of some fun songs. ALthough the first song on the first cd "" nature"" I think is great. And on the second cd, the song "" gearbox"" is a smooth trance vocal."
2,The Half-Mammals of Dixie,"Not a bad book, but if you're really wanting a good collection of stories from the South, read Tim Gautreaux's Welding with Children."
5,Awesome book,Great book - Gould's claims can't be verified through scientific fact. Amazing critique.
4,Common Cents$!,"This small, short little book is a powerhouse of knowledge, cures, and a ""must have"" for anyone with Clorox in their home! (Ugh!)Old hippies have probably forgotten that they knew this stuff, their kids will enjoy the simplicity (and think they discovered it!)...it's that compactly good. From acne to athlete's foot, ear wax to sink drainage problems, the simple values of a very few tools are amazingly available for trial. If you don't like the results, THEN you can call the doctor or plumber, etc.! Do yourself a favor and buy this little book!"
1,Disappointing Video,"I was looking forward to this video. The production is rather poor. Quality of video is ""hazy"" and poor. The very short video is not worth much. The Hummingbird shots were not the best. It looked like someone copied some video off a TV show. They did not have good equipment to do so!"
2,Buzzkill,Characters are lam plot lines choppy didn't like the flow. In all not one of her better works seems rushed and not a lot of thought process . In a single word boring!!!
2,bissell style 7 vacuum cleaner bags,"The Bissell vacuum works really great but the bags in style #7 are very difficult to find. The bags are expensive and are only half the size of most vacuum cleaner bags. I have had to order replacement bags each time because you can't find them in stores. I would recommend checking into this before purchasing your next vacuum, but if you are like me and already own this type vacuum then Amazon.com has been the only place I have found that carries these bags. I'm very disappointed in the price, the size and the difficulty in obtaining these bags."
2,Hard to Find,"A Kitchen & Housewares enthusiast from Myrtle Beach, SC comments on the inability to locate this item in the ""Real World"". I have have to agree!Recommend:Order 3-4 sets of 3 (1 a month for the year) to avoid the search again in three months."
1,These bags fall apart.,"These are not good quality bags. The cardboard part comes apart from the bag when both attempting to attach the bag to the vacuum cleaner and/or removing it.Some of the reviewers have stated that these bags were hard to find. I had some older Dirt Devil bags that looked similar. I used those, and they worked perfectly. I don't think it's imperative that one uses these bags with the Bissell. You just need to get the bags that are shaped similarly. The Dirt Devil bags are constructed better and were easier to find."
4,Good,It was easy to change the Dust Bag.I think it is not easy to find this same item in the shop.I'm happy that I can clean by vacum cleaner.
4,Replacement bags,"Couldn't purchase replacement bags locally, so had to order them online. It was cheaper than driving to the next town"
4,Fine,"Vaccum bags are as described. Hard to find bags, glad to find on Amazon for a reasonable price."
2,Courtney Love??,DOES N' Y ONE THINK THIS LOOKS LIKE COURTNEY LOVE??? BECAUSE IT IS UGLY LIKE HER SORTA (LOLZ) AND THE HAIR IS LIKE HER AND RED LJPSTICK AND SHIRT. WHO ELSE THINKS THIS LOOKS LIKE COURTNEY LOVE????
5,Bratz Step Out Cloe,"This doll rules! I love her over sized sort of t-shirt, and her jeans totally match. Her hair is different, too. But in a nice way! It's long at the back, and short at the front. Her second set of clothes are nice too. I like the glittery top, and the skirt is short, but nice. Her make-up is beautiful, aswell. It's quite dark, but nice. Also her lipstick is deep red, but looks nice on her.I think you should buy this doll, as it is one of the nicest from the step out collection, along with Yasmin and Jade.~~~Gemma~~~"
4,Bravo!,"This movie is touching and heartbreaking.The lovely Romaine is perfect in her role as Laura ,the devoted girlfriend.Its a shame it didn't get more notice in the States."
4,Does the job,"I've had this screen protector about 4 months now. It does what it's supposed to do. I did get some air bubbles when it was applied and they never worked their way out, but I have a house full of animals and it's virtually impossible for me to apply something like this without getting a piece of hair between the screen and protector.Overall it's a good product. My finger doesn't drag or stick when swyping, which has been a problem with more expensive screen protectors. I would order one again when I need it."
2,Huge Disappointment,"Unlike the other person who reviewed this CD, I had high expectations when I purchased this, and was sadly disappointed. The songs are all extended versions, rather than the hit radio versions. I was a huge fan in the 80's of Nu Shooz, Regina, and Stacey Q...but if you are looking for the versions you remember hearing on the radio, then you better keep looking because you won't find them here. Also, unlike the previous reviewer, I also had heard of and loved Nancy Martinez's Top 40 hit, ""For Tonight"" and I also used to love listening to Mel & Kim at the clubs with ""Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend)"", but even the extended versions of those songs are not the way I remember hearing them at the clubs ""back in the day."" I am hanging on to this CD until I can find the original single versions of these songs, but save your money and pass on this one."
1,not pleased,"I am dissatisfied with this product. You have to open several times before the motor turns on. Also, it has nothing to do with the smoke you are blowing out of your mouth. It only helps when you put the cigarette in the ashtray which is not that often when you are smoking, Right?"
2,Read The Book Instead,"I'm a big fan of writer Don Winslow. I really enjoyed his book The Death and Life of Bobby Z. So I got a copy of this movies to see what the film version was like. The acting was wooden (even with a good actor like Lawrence Fishburne), but for the first half of the movie, it kept pretty much to the book. After it started deviating, the movie quickly went downhill.My suggestion is get a copy of the book, and forget the movie."
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","I started to watch this movie thinking it was going to be a good action-filled movie. Good actors, good story. What can be wrong with this?Well, everything! It is probably one of the most boring movies that I have seen in years! The story sucked; it was very uninteresting, the actors were sleep-walking, the dialog was childish... the movie was a complete flop. Such a flop that I kept changing channels in my cable box."
3,"It Had Potential, But It Needed More...","This movie had the actors, had a plot, but the storyline was not developed enough. The fight scenes were good, but the dialogue wasn't all that great. It was ok, but it needed a little more. It was pretty low budget as movies go. It grabbed my attention because I was waiting for something more...but it really never came. There was not a lot of suspense. Almost everything was pretty laid out within the first 45 minutes(ish). Rent or cheap buy. I wouldn't go and spend full price.POSSIBLE SPOILER: One storyline that did grab my attention was Tim Kearney's love interest. You really didn't know where she truly stood until the end."
3,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"I LOVE BOTH THESE ACTORS THIS WAS JUST THE WRONG MOVIE FOR THEM,, IT IS HALF WAY GOOD AND HALF WAY BORING,, I JUST WANTED MORE OUT OF THIS MOVIE AND IT DID NOT DELIEVER!!! THIS IS A RENTER OR TRY TO BORROW FROM A FRIEND OR PAY LOW PRICE FOR"
2,Where's The Beef?,"This low-budget film is a bit disappointing outside of the now famous actors who were in it. I always think that these guys can do better roles, however, the cameos of UFC figherts made me sit up in my seat a bit...they fit their roles almost wittingly."
2,Kinda Dissappointed,"First of all I didn't think that Paul Walker and Jason Lewis looked anything alike. The similarities stop at the blond hair and blue eyes. Second, the movie overall didn't held my interest. The fighting scenes were good but thats about it. I'm not sure if it sticked to the story because I've never read the book but I plan on doing so. The acting wasn't believable to me. I couldn't take it seriously."
2,"Yawn, stretch","Bobby z starring the great laurence fishburne is a tale of a dirty agent (fishburne) and of a convict (paul walker) that looks like the big time drug deler Bobby Z. i didn't really care for this movie because it was totally unbelievable and the plot was boring. It is another drug movie/crooked agent/mistaken identity movie. The real bobby z and walker didn't look anything alike to me, and the fight scenes just didn't look realistic to me. Once again blockbuster online saved me some money on this movie. I still wasted two hours of my life though."
3,Bobby Z,"Have always liked both the stars in this DVD, and will continue. This story line has been done numerous times, but this time around, didn't have much going for it."
1,"Book was great, movie a stinker",dont waste your time. Wow this was a stinker. And after reading the book I thought how great this movie could have been
4,"Surprise, Surprise","This book was kind of slow at first,but it got really good. I feel sorry for Jessica though. It seems that when she falls for the perfect guy,they either leave her or die.(that rhymes :) Surprise,surprise...Elizabeth fell for Mike McAllery,Jessica's ex-husband. Of course,who wouldn't...but Elizabeth should have more common sense than that. Well,it's a good book anyway."
5,Suspense in the making...,"I thought this book was great. I was not expecting Elizabeth to fall for Mike- Jessica's ex-husband. I hope that soon Danny finds a way to see Isabella. Hopefully, the person spying on Jessica is Nick just watching out for her. Overall the book was great and left me curious for the next book."
2,there are a lot of better sweet valley university books,"Normally I like the sweet valley university book, but this one is so unrealiztic! I like the Elisabeth character a lot, but this is not the real Elisabeth. A question to the author - this is the third time a boyfriend of Jessica is ""having problems"" !!! I think it is enough."
2,NOT THE GREATEST,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. I thought that Elizabeth's attraction to Mike McAllery was really unrealistic, considering the fact that Elizabeth has always been the ""good"" twin and would never have in the past considered going after her sister's ex-husband. This ""quest for passion"" that Elizabeth seems to be on is a mediocre storyline. To the author --- wake up and write something that seems like it could possibly happen."
2,Apparently there are only psychos and stalkers to date at SV,"How realistic is it that Elizabeth Wakefield would not only fall for her sister's ex husband, but also in the midst of jessica's depression? The ex husband who beat Jessica up, emotionally abused her and tried to kill her... Its so silly! But then again... This is the same Elizabeth that fell for her psychotic stalker William White the third time he came back to life, and after the second time he tried to kill her. Even with his face disfigured and a criminal record. Does Laurie John really want us to admire this girl? Cant we have strong female characters instead of weak willed, dependent and clingy soap opera heroines?"
2,This isn't a true 4x2,This isn't a true 4x2 matrix switch. It does not work to select one input to go to both outputs at the same time. You can but the signal gets messed up.
2,"Works as advertised, BUT...","At Friday's price of $74 it's a good deal, AT Sunday's price of $101, Up $27 and $11 over List, Amazon is ripping you off, PURCHASE ELSEWHERE!"
4,Something Everlasting,"Gene Owens' EP follow-up to ""Beautifully Strange"" is another excellent set. ""All I Need"" is a catchy hook-laden track with the emotionally potent chorus, ""All I need is something everlasting; all I need is someone just like you."" ""Never Change"" is a midtempo rocker with Jeff Marshall's electric lead guitar in a song about friends growing apart. ""Into Me"" is another excellent track flavored by Anne King's flugelhorn that has a soft jazz flavor, ""You look just like an angel when you're sleeping; Baby, you got me down on my knees."" ""Election Day"" is an acoustic track with a cynical view of politics. ""Fugitive Moments"" is another excellent set by the talented developing artist. Enjoy!"
5,Exceptional book of pastoral/ministry wisdom,"I'm almost through this book and it has been amazing. I have read many Christian books but this would be in my ""top 5"" of all time. Jack Miller shows exceptional wisdom and I feel I have been discipled by him as I've read. This is a book you will want to read and reread frequently. Best book on Leadership I can think of at the moment... maybe Transforming Leadership by Leighton Ford is a close second but is a different style of book. THis is a compendium of letters. It's a very personal view of this Godly leader named Jack Miller."
1,Poor Imitation Glove,Poor fit finish compared to previous gloves. These fit like size 9's. Thumbs are webbed instead of proper cut. Leather crusty in some areas like its overheated.
2,not that great,"I was dissapointed by Lewis' poems. true, their range was one of the largest i've seen (from sci-fi to christian poems), but most were dull and just didn't live up to his reputation. i'd say stick with his fiction like the chronicles of narnia and the dark tower and other stories"
3,"Good smell, does an adequate job","I've used Nature's Miracle for years on pet stains, and found it to be the best at removing stubborn smells, but I'm always willing to try something new.I tried this Bissell Pre-Treat on some old upholstered chairs my husband purchased at a garage sale for $5. He was going to use them out in his shop so he didn't mind a few stains, but I really minded the old-dog-urine smell!After using the pre-treat as recommended, I proceeded to clean the chairs using my Bissell Spot Bot and was pleasantly surprised with the results. The chairs looked nearly new, only two small stains remained on the light colored material. Unfortunately, the smell was more stubborn, and required a re-wash and application of Nature's Miracle to finally make it disappear for good."
5,Just as good as the other Bissell products,"With two long-haired cats, hairballs are unavoidable here, no matter how often we brush them. This spray makes it much more convenient to clean the stains off the carpet, instead of whacking with the SpotBot immediately. Spray on, let dry, and THEN SpotBot. Much cleaner. I'm happy. Ideally I'd change all our carpets to hardwood, but...that's a much more expensive solution!"
5,Shaw discusses and mocks many subjects in this one-act play,"G. B. Shaw is undoubtedly one of the great comedy playwrights as well as a thinker who provokes his readers to think. He shows his ability in this short one-act play in which, despite its brevity, he is able to discuss and mock a host of subjects. These include:England where in 1911, the time of the play, people are not brought up to use their sensesThe English army that does not work as it shouldCompulsory military service, which does not workWomen in the armed forces and in combatThe Women's Suffragette MovementThe attitude of sergeants to officersEnglish politicians who are uninterested in the needs of the common peopleThe revolt of citizens against their governmentWere successful men really women disguised as men?Should women rule the country?Does democracy work?"
3,"wellllllll, better than not having it....","We bought this for our beginner readers at home to complement the other two volumes in this series. I was surprised how very much the book is condensed, it ends at Ecclesiastes. Often times we'll read a story or passage and our little reader of this volume can't participate because the story is abridged and/or not present. If it weren't too late, I would really recommend two volumes of the Old Testament to the publishers. We've only had it a couple weeks, but I've noticed the chapter in Proverbs 31 about the virtuous woman being valued above rubies is missing as is some chapters in 1 Samuel as we get to read about Saul.I do like the book, I'm not unhappy I got it, but I would have happily paid for two complete volumes over one condensed one."
1,incomplete book,"This book has many missing chapters and verses making it quite incomplete. This book is well done excpet for this fact and would have been much better as a two-volume COMPLETE set. I took mine back to where I purchased it, but would buy IF AND WHEN the book is complete with ALL the chapters and verses included. Approximately 1/3 of the Old Testament is left out."
4,"I gave it back at first read, now I'm buying it again","Yeah that's right. I read this book about a year ago, and because of its somewhat strait-forward and simple presentation I decided I wouldn't need to keep it, so I sent it back.Well soon afterwards, I realized how much I had learned from this book and how it really does change the way you communicate. I especially appreciated the focus on listening. Really, most of the advice found in its pages have proved to be true and helpful to me. So even though I now have to buy back a book I've already read, its definitely worth it."
1,More effective than a sleeping pill,"This tape is so unbelieveably boring and obtuse, I've listened to it several times to convince myself I wasn't missing something. Nope, nothing missed, just an extremely monotone voice droning on and on, taking 10 minutes for a 1 minute topic.Mr. Van Fleet's comments would be well received in the 50's, but it's 2002 and most all his ""helpful"" points are dated or oversimplified.""People like to hear you use their name""; well, Mr. Van Fleet, that is interesting advise Mr. Van Fleet. Tell me Mr. Van Fleet, how did you come to realize this gem of a pointer, eh James ?If you want advice from the mid 1900's, buy anything from Carnegie - you can't go wrong."
2,Mostly a Rehash of Dale Carnegie,"Most of this tape is a rehash of Dale Carnegie principles - use people's names, make them feel important, etc. The program is 99% focused on business communications with very little focus on personal communications. 25% of the program gets sidetracked on how to reprimand an employee. I wanted the focus to stay on conversation skills. Also, the author uses way too many lists of steps (i.e. the 11 steps to improving in these areas with several of the 11 steps being 3 or 5 step items in themselves). You must take notes while listening to keep up with all the lists of steps."
4,Pear Harbor The Real Stroy,I bought this for my grandson who is into the WWII right now and he was really moved about the real pictures and interviews. so it was a big hit with him.
1,"NOT THE ORIGINAL SONGS, OFTEN!!!!","This is Bunk, while some songs are original, many are not. Chicago's 25 or 6 to 4 sounds like the original singer, but it is not the album or single cut of this classic. The Troggs Wild Thing is simply butchered by a bunch of idiots who are NOT the Troggs.Note the title, carefully crafted so as not to claim that these are actually the originals. Trust me, they are not.DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!"
1,"First one didn't fit, second one did.","Filter didn't fit well, it was a bit large in one corner which caused a gap. Amazon did a quick and trouble free return as always. The replacement arrived the very next day after I requested a replacement. The replacement fit perfectly, so it was just a one of defect. I would purchase again especially through Amazon, saved me a ton of time and money."
1,Defect,"I received my Bosch replacement filter for 2007 Merz C230 but like someone else on here said, it was mishaped and doesnt seal like the factory filter. I think these filters are being made in China and the quality is not what the name Bosch use to mean. I dont have the time to repackage and send back. I did my best to get a good seal and will not order again. I now understand you MUST ask the seller questions because they are sneaky...ask is this a ""NEW UN-OPENED BOX"" and ""Brand New Never Used Before"" and ""This is not a returned re-stocked item"". These sellers will not disclose these little details. Amazon is losing cred's with me very quickly."
2,Silver,"I did not like the silver color, my son said that it looks like robot shoes. I wish it was white."
5,My most favorite book in the kitchen,My Mother gave me this book for Christmas two years ago and you can already see the wear in it. I have a tremendous collection of cookbooks and this one is the one I reach for the most. It is clear and concise and best of all I have never had a failure with any of the recipes. I had always had a difficult time cooking liver and onions and this is by far the best recipe and guidelines to follow. So many wonderful dishes and varieties. This would make an excellent gift for a beginner cook or someone who really enjoys cooking and trying new recipes!!
5,great book,I already owned this cookbook and bought it as a gift as I love all the explanations and tips it provides. Easy to follow and great pictures as well.
3,Some helpful tips and tricks for novice cooks,"This is one of those books that beginner and intermediate home cooks buy in order to learn some basic tips and tricks that most cookbooks tend to gloss over, and which more experienced cooks have already learned from experience.Most of this stuff seems a bit trivial and old hat to me (there are far better and more robust tomes available for such things, but they're frequently too intimidating for novice cooks). However, it's selling fairly well, and it's certainly a good book for beginners, so don't let my somewhat jaundiced yawn discourage you."
2,BAD WINGS,"My 4 year old daughter loved this doll but, 1 day after receiving it, the wings broke. Not even super glue would hold the wings together."
2,Wings Broke Off Right Away,"My daughter received this doll Christmas morning, and she played with it for approximately two minutes before the wings came off. The rest of the doll seems okay, durability-wise, but be prepared for some tears, anguish, and requests for parental miracle-working to repair the wings."
1,listed incorrectly,this product weighs less than 34oz for 1 bottle. the 25 lb weight listed would be for a case of 12 bottles. this is also consistent with the price. there is no mention of quantities of bottles that would justify this high price.
3,so so,The material is a bit cheap...made in China of course. I would be suprised if it lasted more then fours years. Not worth the money
3,Fragile,"This phone broke very easily. I destroyed it in 2 weeks, my other sidekicks took a beating and kept on ticking.Fragile.-Richie Etwaru"
1,the worst phone i ever purchased,i know its not just me being unlucky with htese phones becuase i went through 5 of them...and im not bad with my phones.pro's: the trackball and its very easy to use.con's: it froze and turns off all the timeeverything always gets deleted if you dont purchase the internet with it.no camerapuctures cant get sent to your phone with out the internet.and sometimes texts just wont send
4,Solid Solo Effort From Lou,"""Here I come, ready or not,"" sings Lou Gramm at the beginning of his 1987 solo album, ""Ready Or Not,"" and it's an excellent solo debut for Foreigner's lead singer (although Lou's solo career would be short-lived: he recorded a second solo album that went nowhere, and promptly returned to the Foreigner fold for 1995's ""Mr. Moonlight""). Gramm doesn't stray from the hard-rocking Foreigner formula on ""Ready Or Not,"" but that's fine with me 'cause these songs totally rock. Standouts include the Top Ten hit ""Midnight Blue,"" the title song, ""If I Don't Have You,"" ""Arrow Thru Your Heart,"" and ""Lover Come Back."" Lou's voice is in top form, and, as I've already said, the songs rock. If you're a big Foreigner fan, then you've just GOT to get Lou Gramm's ""Ready Or Not""!"
4,lou gives it his best when solo,this is a great first album by a legendary singer he was awesome in foreigner now he shines on his own but without mick jones powerful guitar u kinda feel in slushy aor land. its a good album midnight in blue is the radio single most played and top-knotch vocals by lou. really its his second album that sounded better. but the critics say this album is his best. and i can say there right . if you like journey- trial by fire album youll love this!
3,Interesting but shallow,"OK, it's an interesting book, with much anecdotal information and philosophical musings, which the author is obviously good at. Included, for example, is how the disease affected certain famous people. However don't expect much here in the way of scientific information or practical advice. The book is also rambling and repetitive, encompassing tangental topics such as the scenery of New Mexico, and Nazi Germany. The practical information could be distilled down into one short chapter. Nevertheless the book may help you if you are having to cope with this disease by giving some perspective to it."
1,NOT MUCH HERE ON ALZHEIMERS DISEASE,I may be biased because I was looking for the newest findings on this disease and instead found a pretty fluffy overview--Sheck is a fine writer but clearly did not do enough research to write a useful book.
4,An intimate portrait,"I am 24 years old, I have never dealt with Alzheimer's in any way, shape, or form. I happened across The Forgetting in a bookstore, being the intense browser that I am, and was immediately attracted to the portrayal of the subject matter.I enjoyed each page of The Forgetting. With every word, and each carefullly crafted sentence I began to see a different world, one I had been ignorant of and blind too.I discovered the severity of an illness, which in all likelyhood will continue to spread, and battled with humanity's inability to cure this storm of the century.David Shenk guides the reader through the history of Alzheimer's and the very little knowledge we have accrued on a illness which has hit its centennial mark. I am thankful David Shenk wrote a touching and compassionate piece of medical history. Although I may not fully understand the implications of Alzheimer's I am now aware of the severity of the illness and am willing to do what little I can to help."
4,A Basic Getting Started Book,"David Shenk's book is a good basic beginning book for anyone newly associated with the disease. It gives a brief history of the beginning research and awakening knowledge of this horrible disease. A combination of ""scientific"" knowledge coupled with ""real life"" examples make this a riviting book."
5,Mystery,"Gaby and his friends are growing up. He and his friends have many adventures with driving, stray dogs, camping, and gangs."
5,Perception and expectations are everything,"I never had the opportunity to own the LP or the tape. I got the CD from BMG in the early 90's. I have loved every piece since then, I'll probably keep playing this CD (which resides in iTunes now) until the day I die.Notable pieces are Shirley Scott's ""Think"", Les McCann's ""With These Hands"" and ""Compared to What"", and the awesome ""Listen Here"" by Eddie Harris.Columbia records, according to the 2 other reviewers, you are sitting on a pile of ""gold"", you can re-release this with the missing pieces and get people like me to purchase it again. I am serious when I say that it would be worth $20, it's an investment for a lifetime."
5,Best lip balm,"Living in Colorado, I've tried every lip balm imaginable to keep from having dry lips, not only in the winter, but the summer as well. Brave Soldier is the BEST balm I've ever used. I can't keep my two teenage daughters out of my purse, because they love it as well. Awesome product!"
1,What a piece of Chinese junk,"Proudly ""silkscreened"" on the ruler is ""Westcott Since 1872,"" In 1872 they were made in the USA and the writing didn't wear off. I should have returned it the moment I received it, too late. Fool me once shame on you... fool me twice."
2,"Beautiful, but do not last","These collars are truly beautiful, but the elastic of the band did not last a week. Within days of normal wear (we did take the collars off at night when we put them in their crates for bed time), the elastic had streched out and instead of nice fitting the collars were loose and dangling. That would have been a danger and at that point the dogs could have gotten them caught on something. We bought two of them, one Small and X-Small. Our dogs are not rough and just wore the collars, never scratched at the collars or snagged them on anything that would distort the shape. Will not buy this type of collar again."
3,Pretty but didn't last,"I got this for my small cat (6lb) to wear around Christmas. It wouldn't fit on larger cats without being too tight, so be advised. It's pretty, but the rhinestones started falling out after about a week. The settings, then, started snagging on everything, including her. I could tell she was irritated, so I had to take it off."
2,This game isn't very good.,I have this game and only beat Castlevania 2. It is not worth playing because there is nothing to unlock. So don't buy it unless you like bad unmodern graphics.
2,Bad Gamers' Choice,It wasn't what I really expected it to be and it's not worth the money or the purchase for anyone of any age.
2,"Great games, crap package.","This is a great colection of games but the fact that you need to have the disc in just to play them is stupid. These are 80's NES games. It's better to play these games as roms with an emulator becasue you can improve the graphics, customize the controls, lighting or anything you want with ease. Plus with an emulator you can run the games in a window or full screen, not like this piece of crap package. The two stars are for the great games in this package, but the way they were packaged with this lame software sucks."
4,It's good but not great,"The only reason i got this was for Contra & Super C.The castlevania games are not my thing.The only real problem with this is the games play like the (original) nintendo.(Anyone who owned a nintendo back in the days know what i mean.The visuals at times may mess up ( just like on nintendo ).The sound also plays like nintendo.This collection was a straight port transfer to pc.I wish they would make a collection with all contra games ever made and improve the sound and graphics.They should also release collections for XBOX, Gamecube & PS2.( not just PC only )Overall at least I can play 2 of my favorite contra games from nintendo without a nintendo.Another good point about this collection, you can save a game at the exact point you are on.Later you can continue at that very same moment.This helps a whole lot when trying to beat these games.If you are a fan of one or both of these two game series, it may be in your best interest to get this like me."
4,"So glad it's reissued, but....","Thank you Wounded Bird Records for bringing some of Laura's less known 80s LPs back to CD, but why oh WHY did you not include the 12"" version of the Stock Aitken Waterman produced ""Shattered Glass"" as a bonus track???"
5,laura branigan touch,"this is one of the best recordings by any artist i have ever heard.. a true gem.""power of love"" actually makes my heart ache, it is so wrenching.i will never understand why more hits did not come from this."
5,WARNING DRM Content!,"I am sure this is a great product so I gave it the 5 stars as not to lower its rating BUT this is in a protected format that cannot play on every MP3 player. I let my grandson pick this out when he was visiting. I thought he could take it with him. Well, it's in protected .aa format. I have nothing against DRM but I think a large annoying popup warning me (the kind we put up with all the time) would be appropriate especially when you have two kids on your lap and a dog jumping on you."
2,inexpensive humidistat- you get what you pay for,"The first unit was defective: the LCD panel wasn't working. Amazon's partner replaced it without any argument, but took 10 days to get to me. I guess I shouldn't expect too much for such a cheap unit. The humidity insturment is off by about 5% from two other types I have, but that is probably accurate enough. I don't think Amazon offers any indoor-only units other than this one; if it did, I would buty that one!"
5,addagio for strings. a personal view.,"it makes me smile. it makes me sad. it makes me think of my life, the good and bad times. Thought provoking. A song for those quiet moments."
4,Good soundtrack,"the song ""Adagio for Strings"" is da bomb forever. I luv the arranging and the string movement led my music composer George Delerues. 'specially dug ""Barnes Shoots Elias"", that's very tight. Most of the songs on there are ""Tracks On My Tears""- Smokey Robinson, ""Hello, I Love You"" (that's was my introduction to the rock door The Doors led by late lead singer of the band Jim Morrison, RIP), ""White Rabbit"" (Pretty patriotic song and homage to the war goin on) by Jefferson Airplane, etc...Lemme say ""Adagio for Strings"" is such a very cool, very relax, very quiet and real smooth to listen too. For instance, what if I did a arrangement of that anyway? How 'bout that? Lemme I'm very addicted to all types of music scores for TV, film, award shows, video, etc...Recommend u checkout music from Leonard Bernstein, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Henry Mancini, Peter Nero, Al Hirt, to name a few. This is very good listening."
1,Weird,"It's weird because a lot of people make a big deal out of Vietnam, but it was expected because look how lazy and degenerate most American's are. As long as they have their soundtracks and six packs, warfare can be something to listened to on the stereo or watched on tv. Patriotism, freedom and human compassion are dead. This soundtrack and the people who enjoy it are living proof of this."
4,Great mix of music plus movie dialogue,"I have never seen this movie, but I love this album. Even the opening track ""The Village"" which is a part of 'Adagio for Strings' interspersed with gunfire brings vivid pictures to my mind of what is happening. Then there's the great mix of music from the 'Vietnam' era ranging from Merle Haggard to The Doors. ""Barnes shoots Elias"" is a touching, orchestral piece that ends with a rifle shot. The album ends with ""Adagio for Strings"" which starts off with some dialogue by Charlie Sheen and the sound of helicopters in the background, before the orchestra takes over."
4,great and tasty,"I bought it for a friend, and he liked it very much. It is sweet. My friend enjoyed it but if I had bought it for myself, I might not have liked it that much because of being too sugary."
2,Sugar added,I got this as a nice caffeine free alternative to green tea - with lots of side benefits.I was disappointed that it had sugar added.. The list of ingredients is actually strange.The nutrition facts say 0% sugar. The list of ingredients lists sugar as the first item.But it is sweet - a little too sweet for my palate which has banned sugar many years ago.It would help if the list of ingredients were available online.
3,just ok,"Murad makes great skin care product; however, I'm not too keen about the exfoliating cleanser. It's a bit too harsh for my skin so I end up mixing it with my regular face cleanser so it tones down the harshness a bit."
3,It's just okay...,"I really appreciate the fact that it's not got anything toxic in it -- that's why I bought it. But it's just not quite slippery enough to function as a shaving gel. I don't mind not having foam (sodium __ sulfates do that job, no thank you very much), but this stuff was just a little too insubstantial to make for a smooth shave."
3,REVIEW UPDATE,I found this cleaner did a nice job on my oriental rug. It cleaned so well that the wonderful colors in my rug have come back. The machine seems well built but it is somewhat heavy to push and the water tank-in-tank is very small making it neccesary to dump and refill much too often. I find that I really should have done more research and shopped around more before making this expensive purchase. Live and learn.....
1,Don't Bother,"This cleaner never did a good job. Didn't suck up hardly any water that it put out, the attachments are a laugh. Your better off buying the low end Dirt Devil. Bissell does make good vacuums though."
1,NOT WHAT THEY SAY IT IS,"THIS WAS TOLD TO HAVE A ROLLING BEATER BRUSH. THE INSTRUCTIONS INSIDE THE BOX SHOW THE SAME THING.THE ITEM HAS NOTHING. ONLY A PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT ""BRUSHES"" THE RUG AS IT IS MOVED BACK AND FORTH. ALL THIS ITEM DOES IS PUSH OUT WATER AND SUCK IT UP.IT DEFINITELY SUCKS! AND AMAZON WON'T ALLOW A RETURN!!!!!!!!!"
5,Joyful Video,If I need to be cheered up I watch this video. It is thrilling to watch incredible musicians like the women of Sweet Honey in the Rock put such effort into working with children. The music is wonderful and watching the women interact with the children is thrilling.
4,Nice Read,No doubt it's a finally crafted piece of literature. How ever I like accurate history as part of Historical fiction and the author combines ancient Egyptian history with Greek History from two very different eras. As allegory it's worth reading but not quite up to Homer. I recommend it for those wanting to sample this Nobel prize winner. Just don't confuse it with historical fiction and ignore the map in the front. It has nothing to do with the story
1,Amazon fitment is wrong,"2006 GMC Sierra SLE front disc/rear drum. This item is for trucks with front AND rear disc brakes. If your Chevy/GMC has rear drums like mine, then you need part 16-1092 for the fronts.Power Stop 16-1092 Front Brake Pad"
4,"Nice tin sign, packaging could have been better","great sign, however bottom right corner was damaged during transit. I was able to put it in a vice and straighten it out and the tin looks great now."
3,Esoteric,"Essentially a coming of age tale for both Alfgrimur and Iceland. Alfgrimurs osolated life is challenged by school, modernity and the enigmatic Gunther Holm.The story is witty and amusing enough to keep you reading to the end,the characters are both real and surreal and he paints the landscape well. Its just that this book is so rooted in Icelandic traditions and culture that unless you really know much about Iceland you miss the finer points of the book and it comes over as esoteric.Enjoyable enough, but esoteric."
4,Fish Can Sing - Halidor Laxness,"Unusual, fresh, fascinating glimpse into life in a small isolated fishing village in Iceland. The young boy is completely absorbed in his simple surroundings - catching fish, observing the characters about him, sharing the ups and downs of the strangers who inhabit the same dwelling, both the living and dying; with emphasis on the search for the 'pure' note of an almost mythical famous Icelandic singer who is the boy's hero.Evocative, even the lumpfishing!"
3,Funny Roy Dupuis,This was a fun film that Roy Dupuis did back in 1996(release?). About a man who would do anything to hide his financial problems from his wife. It makes you wonder what would you do to keep up public appearance?
1,Philosophy of Punk... WHAT THE HELL!?,Philosophy of punk?!Punk is not a set philosophy...This guy has no idea what he is talking about...
5,THE philosophy of punk: More Than Noise,This is probably the best book on punk i've ever read and since it focuses on more of the unpopular bands it's gaurenteeed to give the reader 60% or more new info.
5,Lots of Help,"When this book first came out I was still in highschool. A struggling punk trying to make it in a world of people who just didn't understand. This book helped to reasure me of what i believed, as well as informing me of things I did not know. I actualy gave this book to my parents to read in hopes of having them understand what I felt. I feel as though it is a book everyone should read weather you are a punk, a skin, a mod or just an everyday person. It is a great explination to something most people don't understand."
1,Amateurish and Starry-Eyed,"This book was originally the author's college thesis. I can't imagine any reputable university accepting it, as it's written on a high school level. It purports to be an overview of the punk ""scene,"" but is in fact a rather near-sighted idealist description of the author's hometown vegan peace-punk scene. The politics described within are indeed admirable, and I sincerely hope the junior high mall punks who read this book take them to heart. However, as a true depiction of what punk IS (versus what he thinks it should BE), it fails."
2,The limited philosophy of punk,"Yet, another attempt to define the elusive state of mind that is punk rock. The first chapter on ""Why Punk"" and the last on ""DIY"" are quite good. In between, it's just the author's limited this is punk, this is not, punks don't do this, etc., etc. I was punk in '77 and did a lot for my scene. I also have an understanding of working within and beyond the system. I'm not sure this author does. I wonder what he would think of me buying this book on Amazon.com."
3,Insightful,"An insightful account of the major discourses running through and holding together the punk rock subculture. O'Hara is obviously an active proponent of the scene, as his voice is intelligent yet empassioned. This does lend itself to a glaring lack of objectivity and some overgeneralizations, however, which may fuel his relegation of punk's more insidious views - i.e., racism, sexism, etc. - to an extreme minority status within the scene. Regardless, it is an excellent primer for the initiated, the unitiated, or anyone in between seeking the pulse of this vibrant, much maligned entity."
1,Narrow Focus and Poorly Written,"Originally written as a college paper, this book takes the author's personal beliefs and poorly attempts to make them the entire history of a loosely defined set of musical and cultural styles that began probably long before the author was old enough to speak. He's a hippie punk with crusty leanings, which means love, peace, anarchy and not bathing too often, and the whole history of punk is redefined to the point of pretending most everything else doesn't exist.It's hysterical reading his mental gymnastics when describing Anarchy as both violent and peaceful. This book is soooooooo poorly done. It's not a history at all, but an editorial steeped in wishful thinking and limited mental resources."
1,"If the punx are united, they will never be divided","O'Hara's personal feelings completely undermine any compelling argument he begins to make. He includes no evidence, other than a few random quotes from zines he's selected, for his accusations (against Straight Edge punks, against Oi punk, etc.). The book is a biased attempt at personal expression of his feelings about punk--not a comprehensive overview of what Punk means to so many people in the scene. And it isn't even well-written. Waste of money."
2,frustration,"This would be one of the best concert videos ever if the songs didnt get interupted every five seconds with snippets from a band interview. Who on earth thought that there was no reason to include an option to watch the concert without all these interruptions? I mean it's a DVD! You can do anything with these things! Sabbath is in fine form in the performance, it's just a shame it was ruined with the interview stuff. Go buy the 'reunion' CD instead."
3,Mixed songs,"There is only one song in here that I would say sounds Irish. The restare more folk songs that sound more American. The cd is all right, butnot the greatest."
1,A good alternate to waterboarding,"OK, i know where to start.If you force someone to watch this movie, then you are either interrogating him or punishing him.If you want to avoid waterboarding a suspect and all its supposed illegalities, then make them watch this movie, before 30 mins, they would literally cry in front of you and beg them to release them from this torture and sign any confession you want.And, MPAA, if you want to punish someone because they downloaded a movie illegally, make them watch this movie. That will be the last movie they will ever download; legally or illegally."
1,Stay away from this one!,This movie is a waste of time and money! I wonder how the other reviewer gave it 4 stars!
1,NEVER get this movie!!!!!!!!!!,"I watched the tom cruise one and boy is it cool!! but this one. Is the worst I thought is was going to be good but after I watched it my mom came in wondering why i hadn;t been out my room well, I was on the floor sucking on my thumb putting my arms around my legs rocking back and forth saying "" this isn't the movie, this isn't the movie"" over and over again just picture me doing that. And since when do people get to fight aliens in their aircraft! speking scientificly it's impossible. If you plan on getting this, dont! it'll just be a waste of you're time. I wish I could put 0 stars."
2,I really wanted it to work.....but,"Ok, so from what i saw, they wanted to make a movie as big as the TomCruise - War of the Worlds, but they tried doing it without a big budget.So what you get is: some good looking Martian walkers...Martian sets that looks like they came out froma lost in space episode.Big action scenes, that really dont work good.Anyway, i did'nt find the movie that bad, it had a story, lots of talking and a handfull of actors/actress.Good for a view, not a keeper."
1,Justa 25 cents a short,"The comedian, Father Sarduchi, had a routine where he ended up in purgatory after being just a 25 cents a short - of paying for his sins. How much short where these people of paying for decient sound editing?The background noise drounded out the dialog and the 5.1 dolby would not register on my system (I checked with other videos and my system was fine).The special effects did not match the dialog. An example would be the order for the earth forces ships not to fire, every one agreeing not to, and every ship is shown firing. They do a very brief FX on the 100s of earth ships vs thousands of Martian ships and show it over and over. I would think they could have gotten a High School nerd or College student who could have done a far better job and have been thrilled to have been part of this movie as their only payment.Re-mix this movie and try it on the market again."
1,Worst Movie Ever. (I'm Not Exagerating),"Don't buy this movie. Don't rent it. Don't watch it for free. Don't give it as a gag gift. Don't even use the DVD as a coaster.Everything about this film is ludicrous, and if C. Thomas Howell had any sense he'd have paid money to keep this movie from being released. The script is nonsensical. The acting is laughable. The costumes and scenery are horrible, even by low-budget standards. The ""special effects"" are embarrassing. The music often overpowers the dialogue. There is not a single redeeming thing about this project. Most films that get this far off the tracks are canceled before they are completed. I am stunned that someone thought it was worthwhile to press DVDs of this mess.C. Thomas Howell was once a very promising young actor, but after this mess (he wrote/directed/and starred in it), you have to question whether he's lost his judgment or if he's just that desperate for work."
1,TERRIBLE! JUST TERRIBLE!!,"I don't even have the words to describe how bad this movie is. It is nothing like the first one, which I loved. I purchased the blu-ray version cheap, and now I know why. Not the sellers fault tho. I seen the bad reviews, but decided to get it because it was cheap. I thought maybe I would have a different opinion. I was dead wrong. It isn't even worth $8.00 on blu-ray. Read all the DVD reviews on this before you buy. Why would this embarrassing, shameful excuse of a movie, even hit blu-ray. waste of time and effort. A true real stinker. stay away from this movie. Recommended for frisbee throwing with your dog and friends, or torturing your enemies by forcing them to watch it. Your enemies will be begging for mercy if you force them to view this."
2,Any movie that makes me laugh this much is not all bad,"This is a pretty bad sequel .This a a B movie. Some of the effects, acting and editing is pretty damn funny. The story will leave you cheering for the end of the world . But when you have a lower budget film trying to be a main stream movie it makes for some funny humor .When I watch a movie like this I am expecting it to be HIGHLY FLAWED. But that is what makes it funny. If you want to watch a serious Movie and be entertained by a Major Production ....this is not it . But if you look at this one and cant Laugh ...You are way to serious .Lets face it .....We All knew going in this Movie is a stinker in a BIG way. Just look at the NON STARS in the lead roles. But it is funny to me because it tries to be good. I didnt waste time watching it because its fun to laugh. If you got some time to kill this is a good one as any to goof on."
2,Haven't seen special effects shots repeated so many time since the original BSG.,"And yet there's something strangely compelling about movies made this way. Maybe it's seeing how epic they are trying to be with obviousely limited financing. This is the way cheap sci-fi movies of our era are made, and how do they compare with the really cheap sci-fi movies of the 1950's? I'd say this movie is better than at least some of them. I would advise watching it without any additional out-of-pocket expense, and late at night after you're too brain-dead to do anything else, including watching a more challenging and substantive movie. It sort of needs a guy and two robots in the lower right corner, but making up your own humor on the way through is fun too."
5,Best price,"Loved finding these holes on the complete series, very happy and the seller even refunded some of the shipping, would definitely order from again!"
4,Better ending than EVA,"Though that isn't hard when you think about it, but the end is good. I was hoping for a little more action, but I think budget was starting to nag on them quite a bit. More of the Motoslave would have been nice, then again, as I said before, more action would have been nice.Overall, the end is a bit silly, not that I'm complaining as this was a brilliant series all way through."
4,hmm.. this could have been better.,"Maybe i'm just being anal but, I found the end of this series some what lack luster. while the first three epsoides on the dvd are fine, the last two is where things( in my opinion) fall apart. epsidode 25 is very choppy with the knight sabers running around being very useless, and episode 26 seems incomplete. ....I want more. overall worth buying. Then again i'm bias, cause I'm in love with priss."
3,Your Typical anime ending.,"BGC 2040 leaves you with that sort of ""huh?"" ending, where you think that someone has made a horrible mistake and forgot an episode, or at least another 5 minutes. I can't say that this surprises me much, I don't think I've ever really seen a good anime ending (except Evangellion, and that is only because I've seen it before, and my friends haven't, and to just see the look of confussion come over their faces is great), but this one was even worse than most of the others.Usually there is at least a battle at the end of a series, but this one... it's more like a race. Then when the Knight Sabers finally destroy Galatea, they don't even do it as a team, and it still isn't a fight.I don't know, maybe just me on this one. I'm not saying don't buy it, especially if you own the rest of the series, that just be a stupid thing to say, but I'm saying ""don't be surprised when it stinks""."
1,Short lived and dangerous,"I bought two of these last year and two this year. Since I am home most of the time, I thought I'd save some money and heat the house this way. At this point, three are no longer functioning. The first two heaters just don't turn on any more -- the lights come on, but the fan does not. With one, the heating element comes on even without the fan coming on. With the 3rd malfunctioning heater, it caused a short and small fire in the outlet (scary I didn't notice when it actually occured but rather noticed the singe marks on the outlet and plug). I stopped using the only one that is still working. I would not recommend this heater to any one."
5,great low cost heater,"This compact and fairly quiet heater fills all my needs for heat in a small area. I use it in my office and bedroom to give me warmth where I need it most (my feet) as I watch TV or do computer tasks. It will heat a small room to a very comfortable level in a short time. It has alot of settings 60,65,70,75,and 80 degrees-I usually just put it on high or low speed and let it run. It seems to be well made and looks quite modern. A great fan for the money."
3,"Great heat, great size, great price, poor user interface","This is a fairly small heater that puts out a lot more warm air than I'd hoped for. It's perfect to tuck under my desk and warm my toes when the central heat isn't quite doing its job.However, it's a bit tedious to use, even once you've figured out how it works and what setting you prefer. There is only one button (and 7 LEDs). The first time you press the button, you get continuous high heat, which is a reasonable default setting. But now to turn it off, you've got to press it 12 more times. Suppose you want to use the thermostat, so it puts out low power heat to keep the temperature at 70 degrees. That's 10 button presses when you turn it on, and another 3 to turn it off again. Seems like adding another button, or a dial or something would have made this thing a lot easier to use.I also have my doubts that the thermostat works correctly, but I have not actually tested it with an independent thermometer in hand."
1,"Caused outlet fire, destroyed carpet","We had this plugged into an extension cord to stretch it to the part of the room where we needed it. The plug of the touch swirl somehow overheats; it melted the extension cord and burned the carpet underneath leaving us a nice black chunk. Don't know if this is a problem with just this model or space heaters generally, but we're done experimenting with our lives."
2,Not that great,"I bought this heater after reading the reviews but after receiving it I realized it was not as good as everyone said, the first thing is that it is 1500 watts so it using alot of power for being such a small heater. The second thing is it only stays on for less than 5 minutes then shuts off due to it gets too hot and then you have to wait 1/2 hour for it to cool down before you can turn it on again. This was disappointing because now I have to get a different heater."
4,Good for the price,I've had it a couple years now & it's helping me switch from oil to electric heating.If I want to keep my living room at 65 it seems I need to set it for 70 so the gauge seems a bit off but it does the job.
3,Good Product,"It is a good product, but only five temporary can be chosen. Sometimes it is very cold in my room, but the heater is not running even I adjust to 80 degree. So, I have to click the button to keep it running without temporary setting. And then, I was woken up at night because it is too hot! Not very convenient."
2,Its Good But If It Messes Up No,It Was Good Until I Tried It And It Was Cold Not Hot And It Didnt Work On High Only On Low But It Was COLD
2,Annoying control button,"Length:: 1:41 MinsI bought this heater because of all the positive reviews on Amazon. It's small, inexpensive and heats up a room fairly well. However, I don't like this heater because you have to keep pressing the ""one-touch"" button over and over again to change the temperature settings or turn off the unit."
1,Luck of the draw,"We bought three of these when our building's boiler died, and while initially we were really pleased, a month later two out of three of them have died. The first one was clearly not right from the beginning--every time we turned it on, it blew the fuse. Back it went to the store. We figured it was just bad luck, since the other two were fine. But this weekend I went to turn off the second one and felt a huge static-y shock when I touched the button. Later in the day when I went to turn it back on, the light went on but not the fan or heater. It's dead.The third one is still chugging along, so I guess it's ok, but the thermostat never really worked on any of them--we've just used the high/low setting.End result: Don't waste your money. There's no way of knowing if you'll get a dud."
3,Lasko 754200 Heater,"Well, what can i say? This is a very small heater, 15 inches by 8 inches. I use this in my bedroom and i does the job for a 300 sq ft room."
2,Roller keeps falling off,From day one the roller would fall off. When I replace it where it should be it works for awhile then falls off. Also it does no pick up as well as my old sweeper.
2,sweeper,"First time to use it, brush fell out. Replaced it, fell out again, asked for and got a refund."
1,Not Great,"Growing up my mom had one of these sweepers and I remember it working well and saving us the trouble of dragging out the vacuum. So I ordered this one and it's totally worthless. I have 2 long haired cats and a dog with average length hair and this thing won't pick up any of it. This might work if you have a small place and no animals, but if you have some, buy something else."
4,deep cleans,"I loved this bissel sweeper, excellent product for such a low price. extremely handy, perfect for small spaces but I have used it to clean the whole house. It deep cleans by picking up hair and dust that even a regular vaccuem leaves behind. I have used it for two months, I use it as I often as I need it for quick picker ups. recommended improvements would be to make stronger brushes but it still works beautifully with the ones it comes with. I normally avoid writing reviews but this product makes life a little bit easier, I would recommend it for all college students and for quick bedroom cleaning and for anyone else. It does not need to be plugged in, no batteries required, and no noise involved. environmentally friendly. I hope this helps."
5,Handy to Have,Works well and sweeps up a lot of stuff. Easy and lightweight. A great buy and recommended. Is good on all surfaces.
3,Not sure if this was what I ordered?,"I ordered this item and received a sky blue colored different model I believe. No biggie with an item like this but honestly, it's kind of a get what you pay for type deal. Picks up some, leaves a little behind. You have to go over spots a few times...and this is on a very short-fibered area rug in my living room. I know it's a cheap deal but I guess I expected a little better?"
2,Brush keeps coming loose,"The ends of the wire holder for the handle also go into the body of the sweeper, and hold the brush in its place. One of these ends is short, and keeps coming out of the brush axis. Then the brush gets out of place and I have to re-adjust."
1,I liked it at first and after 3 uses the middle roller fails,"Hi, I bought this item and I liked it right away because it picks up everything and it's so easy to use but after 2 or 3 uses the middle roller comes out of the sweeper all the time, and it also gets bent every time I put it back in it's place. The middle roller is a bit bent and I noticed how cheaply this product it's made. I wish it was made with better quality parts. Is there a way I can get a better one or maybe I can get a refund?Sincerely,Ingrid"
2,Bissell 2100,"I bought this product hoping to cut down on using a vacum all the time to do our area rugs, unfortunately it is very difficult to push on them, if your going to use on wood floors or tile it works well, but not on carpet!"
5,Attitude,"These days you hardly hear someone mention Guitar Slim, and thats a shame since he is one of the greatest. He had a style, unique, and bold for his time. He had voice, charisma, the songs and a guitar tone that grabs you by the throat.The sufferin mind album is better, no doubt about it. He reminds me of Lightnin Hopkins, in terms that they both had their own peculiar style and you can listen to them for hours playing nothing but the blues. Start with 'suffering mind' amd then get this one."
4,Rock & roll innovator,"Although not widely appreciated during his lifetime, many musicians based their playing style on Guitar Slim's techniques. Among others, Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Frank Zappa and Stevie Ray Vaughan drew inspiration from him. Slim's lone R & B hit, the 1954 recording of ""The Things That I Used To Do"" is considered a direct predecessor of rock & roll.These ATCO label sessions from 1956-58 are the last of GUITAR SLIM's brief recording career, which began in 1951. Hard times professionally along with alcohol abuse took their toll, and Eddie ""Guitar Slim"" Jones died in 1959, at the age of 32.The best known tracks here are likely to be ""Strange Things Happening"" and ""The Cackle."" Session personnel and studio dates included-- no bio or song description, however. This collection is recommended for all blues and rock & roll guitar fans.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 38:47"
4,Great!,This was a great read. Different from any other I have read. Would like to see more like this one.
3,"Don't get me wrong, I did like it...","Overall both Warrior's Woman and Keeper of the Heart were nice books, a bit of brain candy to read at bedtime. Tedra can be annoying but funny, Challen one-dimensional but loving. The plot gets silly at times and the ways she gets her characters out of jams is a little too convenient.But one thing I can't get over is how brutally Ms. Lindsey rips off (no, not just Star Trek) Sharon Green's Terrilian Series.There are far too many coincidences, too many identical plot twists, too many characteristics with only very fine details changed and Ms. Green wrote *her* set of five books in 1983/84. I am baffled that Ms. Lindsey is not paying Ms. Green regular royalties.Granted, the Terrillian Series while romantic is grittier and not for the weak of stomach. But folks, these are the ORIGINALS. Read them and try to tell me Ms. Lindsey never laid eyes on them (and took notes)."
5,I really enjoyed this one and Keeper of the Heart.,"I would like it very much if she would write one about Dalden and a women worthy of his love, but that also gives him a hard time in taming her."
1,1 star is generous,"I am a JL fan and I would like to say that I have read all of her books. Unfortunately, I could not even finish this one. When I saw that it was rated 5 stars I flipped out. This book was terrible. Maybe I am not a futuristic type of woman but please!!! Also, the sequels to this book are just as terrible if not worse. Couldn't finish those either. Sorry, I would have given this 0 stars if there was that option! 1 star is generous!"
5,My All Time Fav!,"I had already read a few of her books but this my favorite. I love Tedra. She's so outspoken, bold, her own person. I actually loved the character so much I took the name as my on-line name! I think I've read it maybe 5 times. Of course I know how it ends..but there';s something about it I can't get enough of."
3,Is the end missing?,"This book used to be a favorite of my when I was younger, and I decided I'd like to read it so I bought it for the kindle. I'm almost positive that the last chapter of the book is missing. I can't be sure since I don't have a paper copy on hand, but I really do recall it ending past what this e-book provides. I suppose it's not that big a deal if you don't plan on reading the next book in the series, but it irrated me and that's why I only gave it 3 stars."
5,Now these are MEN!!!!,"I've read this book so many times - I lost count. If you want to get away from all your troubles for a while just pick up this book. It has it all, humor, adventure and, oh ya, those juicy love scenes. What woman doesn't love a hunk who could brake a person in two with no effort at all but would never dream of hurting a woman, in fact, treats them like gold. You have to read about Tedra and her hilariously mouthy computer (who by the way could have a book written about herself). This book was one of Lindsey's best and its sequel, ""Keeper of the Heart"" is just as good, if not better."
1,Waste of time.,"As much as I love reading reviews, I don't tend to write them myself. After purchasing this book and finishing it within 24 hours because I was hoping to justify my purchase, I have to say that it was one of the worst books I have ever read. It's sad because I have read many of Johanna Lindsey's books and loved them. Although the concept of space travel was interesting, Martha amusing, Challen strangely endearing and a sexy hunk of a man, Tedra was incredibly ANNOYING. I loved her sense of adventure but I was so distracted by her teenage ramblings and 'babes' that I started to dislike her. About half way through, I was skipping over all of the pet names and skimmed through pages just to end the story. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Why not finish by herself?,"This book has extreme points, first the good ones:You will read and enjoy most part of the book, is not a page turner but you will laugh while you read, the book won't make you leave the reading and not wanting to start it again.The bad things:When Challen punished Tedra exciting her but not letting her finish as she wanted, why she was awake all night so excited, why couldn't she finished her excitement by herself? I think here that JL could find another kind of punishment.The futuristic part of the book is a little foolish, that is worst while you read that my first point."
5,Exciting Sci-Fi!,I liked the main character so much in this book that I named my daughter after her (Tedra). This is the best example of a futuristic Bodice ripper that I've read so far. The characters are well rounded and actually have some depth to them. I am buying a copy for my daughter so she can read it when she is old enough.
1,Warrior's Woman,This book is terrible. I barely got through it.... The whole talking computer wise cracker. The amazon warrior woman. The supposedly sexy man. None of it fits and is one long boring read.
3,Found in my attic; not my genre,"I am giving this 3 stars simply because I don't even want to read this book. It's just not my style. (Futuristic/Primitive) But since I had a copy in my attic (from the 80's probably) the cover has been much improved. You know, the cover that would make romance reading a secretive, don't-take-in-public book. :)FYI Average of 50 other reviews is 3 1/2 stars. It probably is a good book."
5,off the wall funny,"If your look for a great comedy you've found it, the late Saturday Night Live Cast mate and Host Chris Farly's Last Picture is a ninja fighting sibling bonding great time."
4,Great for my Psych class,"I used this a lot in my Intro to Psychology class, it was detailed and very helpful in studying for the tests! Would definitely recommend this to other students taking the course."
3,writing,when i purchased the book it mentioned some writing but when i got it all of the pages had highlighting and the chapter reviews were all filled out
4,Great,"This is a God awful psychology book. However, it was shipped quickly and in great condition! Cheaper than my school's bookstore too!"
1,I never got my second book,I can't say that I am all that pleased with my purchase right now because I never received my second book. The money was taken out of my account but one only of the books arrived and there is no call back number or customer service. This is the first time I've had issuses with ordering from amazon and it kind of makes me question if I should do it again.
3,My book took a journey,I was pretty unsatisfied with how long it took for my book to arrive. I ordered this book and another one on the same day. I had received my other book two days after ordering. It took two and a half weeks for my book to arrive and I really needed it for class which really upset me. When I received the book it was in pretty good condition. The description failed to mention that there was cover damage that was fixed with tape but overall the book was still in good condition.
2,plastic like,"I recently purchased this watch at big discount ($29) via a company for whom I work. The list price here seems to be roughly $70. Quite honestly, you could go to Target and buy a Casio that is far more sturdy and has more features for the same retail price.The band on this watch is very inflexible, stiff rubber and doesn't conform to the wrist very well. The dial around the outer edge is plastic, not metal. In fact it's so plastic-like that you can sometimes see the light gleem through. The numbered ring also doesn't turn very easily and needs to be forced.I'm not that familiar with the Freestyle brand, but this watch really isn't worth more than $20 if you look at other competitors. You could probably buy something better in the GI-Joe section of Toys-R-Us.The background light only illuminates the small digital portion of the face."
5,menages at their best,"I do love all romance books out there, but if you are in the mood for one with alot more kick this one is for you. Romance at its best with a great plot of overthrowing government of another world. and between you and me its nice to get away from this world and read about another. This story is of two princes who meet their one their true love although at first it doesnt seem that way, it like some people takes a bit to figure out she is the one for them. Read it you wont be dispointed."
3,what to say about this one.......,"well, it had alot of sex, wich isnt really bad but the characters had NO depth and you didnt really understand what was going on becuase it often got alittle too messy.It seemed unrealistic and the amount of sensless sex got to a point of annoyance! I have been the type to complain about not enough sex scenes.........but not haveing a true storyline or anything is really irritateing.I will get the second book to see if it is any better, all in all this isnt the worst but a few tweaks and it could have been amazeing..........or at least ecitingly thrilling"
1,PLEASE.,"People. Don't. Ride. Horses. In. Stilleto heels. Bratz dolls are pointless. Like Barbie, they come out with tons of different dolls. Well, the only thing different is the clothes. Why don't they just make a few dolls and lots of outfits? You're essentially buying the clothes, not the doll."
1,ugly (bratz lover),"sorry but i think this fianna is very ugly. all the colors on her just don't look good to me. and it kind of looks like someone rubbed grease all over her face. i like dana and and the new african american one, not fianna. dana's long hair is just beautiful! be sure to check out the new campfire felicia which is african american with very dark and beautiful skin."
4,wow baby,"This is terrific. I love it it""s very coutry girl. love and I'd love to say ""I LOVE YOU MGA"""
2,Who gives a crap?,"Okay, I personally hate all the Fianna dolls because of her hideous hair color! Who thinks gross poopey-booger-yellow hair is attractive? Her faux leather tops are sort of tacky along with her out-dated cowgirl hat! I do have to give the Creative Dept. at MGAE props for Fianna's hot turqouise and tan pumps. I also like her makeup and face-design. I sort of like this doll...sort of..."
3,Stop !!!!!,If you don't like MyScene then shut y'all big hole in y'all face. Some people don't like Bratz some paople don't like My Scene. If you don't like on or the other don't write no bad comments. Stop the Bratz vs. MyScene. Shut y'all big mouths up! Don't write nasty rude comments about either one.
4,Glad I bought it,I'm not a huge Steve McQueen fan but love his LeMans film. I've watched it loads of times and every time I'm more hooked. I've just finished reading the book and looking forward to watching the film again as I know the experience will be even better. The information about the filming and McQueen himself shows the passion and desire for realism with which it was made. It took me a while to get round to getting the book but as a huge fan of the film I'm really glad I bought it.
5,It's just like being there!,"This book is for anyone that likes Steve McQueen, vintage sports car racing, or the movie Le Mans. Of course there's everything there is to know about the movie itself, but there's also a Steve McQueen bio, a history of that era's race cars, AND a history of the Le Mans race too! It's a big book that takes a while to read and once you're done with it, you're gonna want to read it again."
4,Interesting companion to the movie,"This book covers the making of the movie, ""LeMans"" as well as could be done. It is an intermediate sized paperback with photos in black and white. The descriptions of the details and characters is informative and very interesting for a fan of the 24 hour race or of Steve McQueen the actor, producer and racer."
1,"Works great at first, but then breaks down","Like many other reviewers, I found that this vacuum worked great for about 6 months, but then it started screeching, and the brush stopped spinning. Also, the ""powered"" hand tool is powered only by the suction from the vacuum, and it clogs easily with pet hair. I bought this on advice of Consumer Reports, but I wish I would have read the other reviews here before buying. I'm going back to a Kenmore. DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM"
2,The repair guy hates this model,Within 6 months of purchase the self-propelled feature broke. Repair guy said it would be $100 to fix but the vacuum would still work without it so we passed on getting the fix. 6 more months the on/off switch broke; easy fix for $20. 6 months later the brush is having rotating problems (not a belt problem) so we are now shopping for another vacuum.
1,Broke the first day,"On the first day we used it, it caught the fringe of a throw carpet and wound it around the brush -- which is not an uncommon occurence. What is uncommon is after unwinding what it caught, then spit out bits of black plastic, and then the brush made a quite a racket when it was being used. Luckily, we bought from a good retailer, and they took it back."
4,POWER PACKED--U PAY THE PRICE,"I PURCHASED THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF THIS VACUUM. IT IS EXTREMELY HEAVY SO WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE TOTED SOMEWHERE I MUST ASK MY HUSBAND TO MOVE IT. GOOD LENGTH ON THE ELECTRIC CORD. HOSE LACKS LENGTH I NEED FOR CLEANING CEILING FANS, COB WEBS, ETC. THE HOSE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH GIVE AND IF YOU PULL TOO HARD THE VACUUM WILL TIP OVER. BELTS ARE A PROBLEM AND THEY ARE A BEAR TO CHANGE, NO OFFENSE TO BEARS. I THINK HOOVER VACUUMS ARE THE BEST BUT A LIGHTER MODEL FOR UNDER $200 WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST FINE. BY THE WAY WE THOUGHT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE BELT WHEN THE ROLLER STOPPED MOVING, IT HAS SUCH A MECHANISM WITH MULTIPLE BELTS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT 70 MILES ROUNDTRIP FOR SERVICE. :("
2,Constant Maintenance,"This vaccuum has had issues since week 3. If you don't change the belts monthly, it won't work at all. If anyone has a better vac for dog/cat hair let me know."
1,what a horror!!!,"WE bought this machine to clean our spiritual center where the 1600 sq feet are all carpet, little furniture. We wanted something self propelled because of the open expanse of floor. It cleaned well for the first few times and then began to growl, and finally the motor exploded in a shower of sparks and awful smell. It was 4 months old. Since it was under warranty we could get the motor relaced, which took 6 weeks. It then worked Ok for about a year and just recently the on/off switch died and it turned on only when it was plugged in. Just last week it exploded again, and would'nt you know, the warranty had expired! The vaccum repair man said it would be cheaper to buy a new vacuum. I guess it will be no more hoovers. Too Bad!"
1,Eats through Belts - BEWARE,After purchasing new from Home Depot we can't believe the number of belt-replacement problems that have been experienced with this vacuum. After putting the twelfth belt on (less than a year) I was convinced we must be missing some part that attached to the spindle (coming out of the motor which the belt wraps around and causes the beater brush to turn) because why else would this thing be eating through belts at this rate? I can't find any sign of a missing piece and the stench this vacuum puts out when a belt burns is like a tire-fire in the house.I'd recommend avoiding Hoover and this unit in particular; we certainly will be when I head out to look for a replacement.Simply awful...
3,hoovselfer u 6439-900,hose is to short to use to vacum or clean furniture. self propel is to jerky and hard to control when moving machine backwards.
5,Great!,"I am a long-time Hoover vacuum fan! I have tried some other vacuum brands, but they just did not hold up to the quality of Hoover. I purchased this model to replace an older Hoover model. My favorite feature on this particular model is the self-propelled feature. I also like that all of the attachments are on board. My only complaint is that I wish the extension hose was a bit longer. This vacuum gives a good, deep cleaning! I recently had new carpet installed, and the carpet layer commented that my old carpet, which was 16 years old, was very clean for its age. For the past 10 years that old carpet had been cleaned with a Hoover upright. If you are looking for a durable upright that cleans well then Hoover is a very good choice!"
2,Disappointed.....,"I am actually quite upset right now. I asked for a nice vacuum cleaner for Christmas about 1.5 years ago and I got this baby. It worked fine for about a year and then I had to start replacing belts. Not hard to do on your own though and not too expensive either. Then the roller stopped moving at all. I'm out of warranty so I buy new belts to try to fix it. I took it to a repair store when that didn't work and the guy said it's the motor that keeps knocking the belts off track and that this happens with Hooovers a lot. He showed me two others in for repair where their motor wasn't as expensive to replace. So I'm back to square one. I need a new vacuum and the repair store told me that Riccar's, while expensive, are good for a long time and come with a 3 year warranty."
4,Great Vac,"I bought that after having an old Eureka for about 10 years. I thought the Eureka was okay, until I brought this home. The Eureka had missed so much dirt and dog hair! I practically filled the entire bag on my first use! As a response to some of the bad reviews here...first of all, all vacuums with good suction are heavy. All of the vacs in the top 10 or 20 on Consumer Reports are about 20 pounds. If you can't lift 20 pounds, you shouldn't buy this. But you should have figured that out if you tried it out at the store. Attachments are super easy to take on and off and work well. The mini vac can get clogged with dog hair if you use it for stairs, I use the furniture attachment. I like it, I think it was a good investment. I'm unsure about some other reviewers expectations...it's going to be heavy, it's going to be loud, it's a vaccum cleaner. All I care about is that it works well and lasts a long time-- which for me, it has."
1,Sorry Consumer Reports,"I LOVED the review from Bookslave it made me laugh! Unfortunately I have to echo most of her review. I too did my research on Consumer Reports to find the best vacuum and thought this was it. In terms of suction it is pretty good, although for hard surfaces like my tile floors, it doesn't seem to do that great of a job. In fact, it works better on floors with the carpet setting than the hard setting. It is a bit heavy but that doesn't bother me, only when you stretch the hose and it teeters over and clobbers you in the head is it a nuisance. The self propel function does work well (good thing for mine because I can't turn it off) and gives more ease to vacuuming. I've always had a Hoover and for the money I spent, won't be buying a new one right away, but the next time, I will seriously look into other brands.Good Luck."
1,Expensive Disappointment,"I had to add my two cents here after seeing some of the positive reviews. I, too, would have written praise for this machine early on. However, perhaps a year and a half or two years after my husband bought this machine, we have had all kinds of problems. The great suction is gone. There are burning smells sometimes, the hose gets clogged, the belt falls off and/or stretches out, and something is wrong with the self-propel feature which makes this very heavy machine impossible to push! I thought vacuums were supposed to last for years and years, and this thing is about to get tossed. I'd give it 0 stars actually. Truly disappointed."
1,Worst Vacuum I've ever owned,"I purchased this unit from ABT Electronics after having owed another model Wind Tunnel and being very happy with it. This unit has been terrible. The beater bar just stops working after about a month. Have replaced the belts and beater bar numerous times, in fact at the expensive cost of the beater bar I could have purchased a new one by now. Took it to an authorized repair shop and was told by the owner that it is probably the worst unit on the market in reliability. I contacted Hoover directly, unfortunately it was after the 1 year warranty was up. They pretty much told me TOO BAD SO SAD, they will do nothing. After only 2 years of owning this unit I am shopping for another vacuum. It will not be a Hoover."
2,Onboard tools - do you use them?,"My review largely echoes the reviews of those who've had the vacuum for over a year. I give this vacuum 2 stars for suction power. I'm prompted to submit a review only to highlight what, as a long term owner of this vacuum, I feel is the most annoying long term drawback of this machine: the hose for using the onboard tools is WAY too short. The vacuum is quite heavy. This combination causes it to fall over almost every time you use the tools. If you need to clean ANYTHING other than your floor you will be *frustrated* (and possibly injured - think heavy vacuum handle on body part containing nerves - it's happened often). Even with all of the other problems I've experienced (and they have been numerous) I would buy this vacuum again if it weren't for this lousy hose design. I would recommend that anyone considering purchasing this vacuum give serious consideration to how often they may need to use the onboard tools."
1,"Great suction, lousy vacuum falls apart.","We bought this too after using consumer reports guide.The thing has high power but the hose, hard extentions, and belts all fell apart in bits and pieces in 7+ months.We vacuum alot with three little kids but this thing just was not up to standard at all. First off a belt that the company site says rarely breaks, well it broke. Then the hard hose extentions started cracking. Then the thing started to lean and the propelling gear stripped. If you don't have that self propell action you might as well throw it away cause you cannot move this beast of a vacuum.This is all in the space of 7 months.A letter to Hover just got a response to take it to a dealer to be fixed. RIGHT!I will look for a brand other than Hoover at this point after years of being a loyal customer."
2,Broken,"I got the item in a speedy time, however the vacuum was broken and won't fix, even though we called customer support and buyed other things to fix it. We have never used this item so far."
2,Thumbs DOWN!,"Upon the advice of Consumer Reports I purchased this vacuum cleaner. WHAT a disappointment! It's heavy, it's NOISY, and it really doesn't clean any better than cheaper models. PLUS, I think it's hard to handle and operate. There's no floor brush, the attachments fall off, and the little cover for the ""turbo tool"" never fit right. Of course it's too late to return it to Amazon.com now ... so I'm stuck with it. I shoulda saved for the Dyson!"
3,"good, but could be better","HI, I purchased this vacuum after much research and asking everyone I knew about vacuums.I love the dirt finder,the filters and self propelled features. But I hate that the hose is so short!!! If I don't use the wands, it tips over while I'm trying to use it. Also, the knob that changes from hardwood to carpet snapped after 2 months use, it has less than an 1/8"" of plastic holding it together."
1,Suction Great - Everything Else is The Worst,"Hoover uses a powerful motor and the suction is great. The restof the machine is terrible. Exterior plastic parts break frequently. Wands and accessory pieces do not ""fasten"" together so they constantly separate when being used. You can't use two hands with the accessories or the vacuum falls over (broke my toe when it fell over as I tried to clean with wand). You must always have one hand on the vacuum to balance it when using tools. I actually bought a second machine (new one on sale) so I would have replacement parts for the many broken pieces of plastic."
1,Stay away from this model,"I'm one of many ""victims"" who bought this vacuum because of #1 rating published in Consumer Reports magazine a couple of years ago. The light went off very quickly, but it was minor. The major problem we encountered is that at some point it started overheating after 10-15 min of work. When it is overheated it automatically shuts off and you have to wait 10 more minutes until it cools down. I could not find any explanation for it. I replaced bags, a filter and a belt, but it did not help. I would not recommend to buy this model to anyone."
1,Hoover WindTunnel self propelled,We bought the WindTunnel for ease of use. Belts became a problem needing replacement every six months. The plastic part that the self propelled belt fit on broke and needing replacement as well. The vacuum cost more in repair than what it was worth. We've had it for three years and got rid of it. I'll never buy another Hoover vacuum.
1,Absolute Garbage - and Dangerous,"We bought this relatively expensive vacuum and it broke twice in the first six months. Then, after only six months use, it somehow jammed up (it was not full) and it started to smoke and might have caused a fire.Customer service refused a refund but said to get it repaired again; we are tossing it in the garbage as I am afraid of a fire in our home."
5,Great Vacuum,The best vaccum I have owned. Cleans great and accessories are placed on the machine so they are easy to take off and put back...they don't fall off! Switches easily from carpet to hard floor and the beater brush can be turned off. The small stair accessory with a rotating brush is a waste of time...the only thing I don't like.
4,vacuum,"I am very happy with the cleaning power of the vacuum. It is heavier than I had expected but has a well balanced comfortable carrying handle for going up the stairs. I do wish the hose were longer, but I see there is a longer one you can purchase as an accessory."
1,Disappointed in CR's 'glowing review',"I'm really disappointed in this vac. I, too like many other reviewers purchased this two years ago based on CR's great review. Pfft. For the past few months the on/off switch hasn't worked, requiring me to plug/unplug the unit to turn it off and on. I decided I could live with that until the knob to change from carpet to hard surface quit moving. My vac is now making a squealing noise when pushed and the roller won't roll without pushing it. As another reviewer mentioned...the vac falls over when you try to clean stairs. I've had the goofy thing fall on me more than once. My DH thought we could see if my father-in-law could fix it (the man can fix anything) but I said forget it..how much is your dad's time worth? I've purchased a Dyson DC07 based on my good friend's recommendation. Hopefully I have better luck. Boo to this vac."
2,Heavy,"It's on the heavy side, but cleans great. Unfortunately, mine is less that 1 yr. old and the on/off switch broke, now you need to plug/unplug it."
1,Why can't I assign negative stars?,"This is a poor excuse for a vacuum. Don't make the mistake of thinking that Hoover is a quality manufacturer. It is no longer true. Yes this machine sucks, but I don't mean that in the normal vacuum cleaner vernacular. If you want to pay lots of money for cheap plastic parts that break after a couple of months of use, you have found your match! It overheats and shuts off for 20 - 30 minutes, it eats belts like candy, it won't stay in the upright position because the latch is broken. IT IS GARBAGE and it belongs in the GARBAGE. Don't bother calling for support or sending it in for repair. The design is inadequate and it is GARBAGE. Have I made myself clear? If you purchase a Hoover product, don't say you didn't know better."
1,Don't buy this vacume,After 3 days all the belts are loose. They are so hard to change my fingers are still bleeding. It is heavy. I'm really sorry I bought it.
1,Absolute Garbage (no Star),"DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM CLEANER. I've had nothing but problems with this product stright out of the box when parts fell off of it. then it kept getting plugged with dirt and carpet fiber to the point it didn't pick up anything. I've had it for about 20 months and use it less than once a week. Have had to replace both belts, one of the belts I've replaced twice. Have had to take it apart because the ON switch was stuck on ""ON"" and wouldn't shut off. Now the self propelled cable is broken and the ON switch doesn't work. I'll be throwing the thing in the Garbage this weekend since that is where this thing belongs. The designers and manufacturer should be ashamed of themselves for selling this product. I will never buy a Hoover vacuum again. Consider yourself warned."
3,Bare Floor Challenged,"Having all tile floor throughout the house, we needed something for bare floors. Our old WindTunnel did the job on bare floors but we ""thought"" we needed a new vacuum cleaner. The new vacuum just does not clean the bare floors good enough prior to mopping. We will continue to use the old WindTunnel until it just quits. The new WindTunnel does great on the area rugs. We need a vacuum - no cannisters - that is excellent for bare floors and this vacuum is just not the one."
3,"""Returned""","Vacuum in perfect - like new condition - HOWEVER - Box was purposely cut and clearly said ""Returned"". Allergy Be Gone listing was for a new vacuum and did not indicate Refurbished, B stock, etc.Removed Vacuum from box when given as a gift. Would be concerned that future purchase of ""Returned"" merchandise would not be in new condition.The Vacuum is great - Highly recommended."
1,Belongs in the trash,"What a waste of money!! Consumer reports rated a similar vacuum very highly when I purchased it in October of 2001. After numerous repairs, we're in the market for a new vacuum. We've replaced the belt 3 times, the carpet, bare floor switch twice, the self propeller no longer works and forget storing the cord.With all the repairs, I could of bought 3 cheaper vacuums and I bet at least one of them would still be working adequately. Will not buy HOOVER again"
1,Too expansive for what it offers,I have owned this vacuum for more than one year. Its roller brush had to be changed four times and the belt once. Now it has problem with the cord. I and my wife are careful users and has never handled it roughly. It is not worth even half the price it is selling for. I bought the hoover bagless after being disappointed with this one. I am disappointed with that too. I will look for other brand now.
2,Didn't last long.,"For $300, this vacuum should last longer than 3 years without requiring expensive repairs. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. After spending $100 to repair an internal electrical problem in April, we are now looking at another costly repair bill."
1,DO NOT BY THIS VACUUM!,"I wish there were Zero Stars to rate it. The belts, whenever you pick up some fringe from an Oriental Rug, somehow become stretched and don't last more than ten minutes until they fall off again...and there are two belts on this abomination.Look carefully at the way Amazon does ratings...they add up all the stars and divide by how many submitted reviews. So, since we're forced to enter a star to review, it skews the results to the positive side. This is the first product on Amazon I've seen with more 1-star reviews than positive ones...need I say more."
4,I liked this vacuum!,"I don't have this specific model, but I have the older model. It's a heavy machine, but works well. My maid, my nanny, and relatives who have tried it (and yes, I even use it myself!) think that the self-propelling feature is awesome. This was the #1 rated vacuum by Consumer Reports, and to the reviewer who wanted to try bagless, BEWARE, because Consumer Reports recommended against bagless."
1,This Vaccum is a joke,I have this thing at work (someone else bought it) BUY A DYSON - you will never buy another brand again - Hoover just pumps out lowest bidder corporate policy garbage. Hoover also tried to steal the Dyson design but got spanked in court after almost putting Dyson out of business. Dyson is the best vaccum I have ever owned - and I do not care about vaccumes - it is so well designed and works so well.
2,"Item fine, service lacking","It took way too long to PROCESS the order, that is, from when I ordered it until it was shipped. Once it got into the delivery system, the shipping time itself was reasonable, if not ""speedy"".I will have to really think it over before I buy a major purchase from Amazon again."
1,Windtunnel stinks!,"My husband and I purchased this machine less than two years ago and have been totally dissatisfied w/ it! It is heavy, awkward - generally poorly designed. It is top heavy and tends to tip over easily when using the attachments. The attachments are difficult to connect and access. I honestly could not recommend this to my worst enemy. Everyone who uses it expresses the same. When I filed a complaint with Hoover and the Hoover store where I purchased it, all they could say was ""sorry"". I did not complain until six months ago since I thought perhaps I just needed to get used to it. Hope this is useful in another person's search for a quality vacuum!"
1,Stay away from this model,"I must agree with the previous reviews. After working well for 1 year and a half, the self-propel motor went out. Disappointing for a vacuum of that price that saw only light use. Too heavy and awkward for my wife to use as well. All in all, I would not recommend this or any other Hoover product to Amazon customers."
2,Major parts broke after limited use,"We bought this vacuum in 2002 based on Consumer Report's recommendation. It has great suction and the self-propeller was a really nice feature... until it broke after very limited use. We spent about $80 to get the propeller repaired, but shortly thereafter the motor started overheating. After less than 10 minutes the vacuum cleaner simply shuts down and we have to wait a long time until it is cooled off before we can resume cleaning.Our vacuum cleaner repair person told us that this vacuum is prone to breaking if you lift it by the handle. You must lift it by the special little handle which is built on the back in the middle. It is not a very convenient way to carry this heavy machine around.We may have gotten a lemon, but we've decided to replace it with another brand."
3,Ho-Hum Hoover,"For the price of this model Hoover, you get a very high-tech-looking vacuum. Yes, it does pick up animal hair marvelously...yes, the attachments work very well. BUT 1) it's kind of heavy and awkward to carry upstairs. 2) it requires a special type of bag that costs more than your typical vacuum bag. And last, but not least, 3) the belt slipped off SEVERAL times within the first couple weeks of using it. Thus, I have stopped using this vacuum in the home and have moved it over to the guest house, where it will be used less frequently. I've now gone back to my original, old Hoover, and I am still on the search for the elusive perfect vacuum."
2,Hoover could do better,"Especially in this price range and with a reputation to uphold I expected more from this vacuum cleaner. The belt is VERY sensitive to breakage and not easily replaceable. You have to unscrew the bottom (4 screws) to replace the belt, where other vacuums I've owned have a bottom plate that pops off for easy maintenance. Also, when you use the on board tools for dusting, etc, the brush does not stop spinning so I have several burn marks in my carpet from where the vacuum rested in one spot too long (before I got wise and now lean the cleaner onto me as I use the on board tools). I would not buy another one, ever. The filter assembly is cumbersome to clean and even just emptying it out I usually end up with quite a bit of dust all over me. Look for something a bit better engineered. Hoover could certainly do better."
1,Hardwood Floors? FORGET this vacuum!!,"I have laminate floors in part of my home. I also walk barefoot a great deal of the time. Yesterday after I vacuumed, as I was walking around I noticed that the floor felt dusty. I got out my handy-dandy Swiffer(TM) and went over the floor in ONE room with it. The Swiffer cloth was absolutely FILTHY - covered with dust and dirt. I've always like my old Hoover but because it hurts my back, I thought buying the self-propelled vacuum would be a good purchase. Although the self-propelling saves my back on my carpets (I don't need to use the self-propelling feature on the hardwood), it is not worth my purchase if it leaves my house dirty."
5,Hoover U6439-900 Vacuum Cleaner,"I am very satisfied with this vacuum cleaner. I was surprised how well it picked up. It seems to be well made, although a little heavy, but I'll take a little weight over cheesy every time. We ordered the 20 foot hose, this makes cleaning the stairs in our two story home a breeze. If it works as well as our last Hoover upright (25 years) I will be very happy."
1,9 months old - dead as a door nail,"I picked one of these up August 2003 and I turned it on this afternoon: nothing happened. I checked the off/on switch with an ohm meter and it seems to be working. The ""helpful"" troubleshooting guide suggested that maybe there was a problem with my house's electrical system or that the cleaner I had not used for several days was overheated -- wrong! I suspect that the thermostat to detect overheating is broken. I agree with the other reviewers that the product is bulky, heavy and awkward. I cannot get in under the coffee table to clean because it is so large. It also tends to fall over when I use the applicances, also mentioned by another reviewer. The only really cool feature is the air-powered beater brush extension -- which I will not be using today because the Hoover does not suck...Avoid this over-priced piece of junk. Next time I will go with cannister vaccuum like the Kenmoore I had that lasted 15 years."
1,Self propelled problems,"I have the U6433-900 which I believe is the same basic model as this. It works good for me for the most part. I have no suction problems or anything. I bought it 2.5 years ago maybe and the cable connector broke for the self propelled feature. I self diagnosed this problem, I could see that there is a cable when I fold the handle back and it is held on by a black PLASTIC doo-hickie that is broken... I don't even want to know how much it is going to cost for a new black plastic doo-hickie when the machine will have to be taken apart for repairing."
3,"This vac really cleans up, but beware cheap parts","So far my new Hoover has performed well but Hoover is already sending me a free replacement part. After using my new vacuum for only 5mins I thought a quick once over inspection was in order. I found the roller brush was spitting out bristles. I contacted Hoover at 330-499-9499 just to see what they would have to say about the problem. After waiting on hold about 15 minutes a very friendly Hoover representative answered, took my information and informed me she would send a new brush roller and drive belts for my trouble. All I can say is thanks, I just hold the next time something breaks they will be so kind.Does a spectacular job of cleaning and is very clean its-self. I'd recommend this vacuum but my change my mind down the road if it continues to break down."
4,Wind Tunnel great for critter hairs!,"I have had two Hoover Wind Tunnels in the past. They perform very well on carpet and for pet hair.....currently we have one furry dog ( American Eskimo) and two long hair cats. I tend to burn through vacuums, so I have to buy a new one frequently. As this is my third Hoover, I do consider it the best vacuum available. My only complaints are : long hairs ( mine probably) tend to wind around the brushes and I have to cut them with scissors every other day...this is quite time consuming , and the belts tend to stretch easily and rapidly. The thick belt is difficult to replace and requires some strength. The thinner belt is easier. I only wish they didn't need replacing so often, but then, I do vacuum every day.It was a pleasure to be able to order this item from Amazon.com.It was easy. Delivery was prompt, I didn't have to wrestle the big box in and out of my car trunk....and I saved money!!!!!Wendy in Novato California"
5,Great Vacuum,"So far I love this vacuum. The light that shows red when you have not picked up all the dirt is a great. This is about my 5th or 6th Hoover, and I have been happy with all but one."
2,Overall - a bad purchase,My vacuum is three years old and everything is breaking on in.From the beginning I wasn't crazy about how it worked. The self-propelled mechanism is needed because its so bloody heavy but it works in a jerky fashion and I can't tell you how many times I've banged into furniture and woodwork. Ugh! When you use the hose and pull on it the vacuum easily falls over onto you or crashes into what ever is close. The first month one of the tubes cracked on me (duct tape ever since). The attachments are always falling off the rear. Belts frequently need replacing. I could go on but just don't get one. I desperately need a new vacuum!
1,disappointed,"bought this in 2006 recommended by consumers report I had a for a month and it broke, months later it stop working alltogether, I would never recommend it to any one sure wasted a lot off money!!!!!!!!!"
1,Hoover has gone down the toilet...,"I ordered one of these and it arrived dead, so I sent it back and received a second one, and it also arrived dead. The second one I took to a Hoover service center and the problem ended up being the motor. Don't they test these products before shipping them? They've gone downhill so incredibly fast the last few years (and since moving to Mexico). This one will be my last."
2,Please withdraw my review,"Please withdraw my review of this product (evh70) since, although I believed that is was accurated when I posted, I discovered that it contains errors."
1,Worst Vacuum Ever,"Forth vacuum in 25 years and absolutely the worst! This machine was always in need of repair, parts & labor $$$$. Belts, levers, cables, and finally a motor. Local shops, (checked two) says this is a machine that keeps their repairman busy. Look at another. Hoover should be ashamed! Have motor and waiting to show Hoover -unlikely they will return my requests for review. The Killer was an an almost full bag unknown to operator, machine running, motor rotor short, now all done -unless you want to buy a >$100 motor. Have never seen this sudden failure before and will never buy a Hoover again. Should be zero stars. Look elsewhere."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I am angry and disappointed with this Consumer Reports recommended vacuum cleaner. On the second use, the knob that controls Bare vs Carpet cleaning broke off and when I took in for repair they also found the small brush belt to be bad. I have decided to return this heavy and cheap plastics vacuum cleaner. I am also going to cancel my Consumer Reports subscription because I am not going to pay for bad advice. I got better information from the reviews on this website, except that I saw them too late."
1,New? or Used???,"On May 2nd I purchased a Hoover Self-Propelled Wind Tunnel Ultra Upright Vacuum Cleaner, the model number on the machine was U6401-9RM. The price was $99.99. the condition was listed as NEW. I received it with in 3 days. After I unpacked it and turned it on, smoke poured out from underneath. I took it to an authorized dealer and I was informed that it was a REMANUFACTURED machine, not a NEW one as it was listed on Amazon. They told me that it only had a 6 month warranty not a 1 year as it would have been if it had been NEW as the listing stated. The dealer had to replace the motor and 2 belts (which cost me $7.00)If I had wanted to buy a reconditioned machine, I would have bought one of the ones that Amazon had listed at the time for $59 or $69. I'm afraid it will be a long time before I buy from Amazon again. There apparently is no way to know if the items they are offering are being misrepresented."
1,worst vacuum ever owned,"We have owned this vacuum for 2 years now. It has spent more time not working than working.If you are looking at this vacuum or any other similar Hoover product, stop now and look elsewhere.I will never own a Hoover product again.Pure garbage."
1,YUCK!! Consumer reports got this one wrong!! Wrong,I used to trust consumer reports but no longer will I blindly follow their suggestions!This vacuum is heavy and old fashioned. The buttons alone are similar to a 1970's model. Mine broke after 2 months. The self propelling feature is powerfull but it needs it because it is super heavy. The suction in this vacuum is incredible at first but is lost after a few uses. I must say that if it hadn't broken I would probably be stuck with it still I am glad it broke!. I bought a Dyson and I love it! WORLD OF DIFFERENCE! Hoover needs to move forward with their design features.
3,I Bought A Kenmore,"After much debate on this model and the Kenmore Direct Drive Bagged Upright (Mdl 33923), I settled on the Kenmore. Thank God. While the Kenmore does not have the self-propelled feature, after reading reviews here, it seems one less thing that can break. Also, there are no belts that can break. I tried both the Hoover and Kenmore, and even with the self-propelled feature on the Hoover this one was not that much harder to push. The Kenmore has the hepa filter, but in addition, it has a second stretch hose (my reason for buying it) enabling me to make it over half way down my stairs with the power brush attachment. The brush is phenomenal! It is electrically driven so it spins no matter how hard you push. I have 3 dogs, 1 cat, and 1 bird, and if this vacuum works for me and keeps the dust down, it will work for you. Buy the Kenmore!"
2,"Thought it was good, but SO disappointing","I thought for the money this would be a good vacuum. Easy to push, suction to pick up cat hair and dust. Boy, was I wrong. The suction never really was that great, and the self-propel feature stopped working about 2 years after purchase. What a disappointment."
1,"I too, was duped","I usually always go by what the consumer who had used the product had to say. Unfortunately, I also listened to Consumer Reports, and of my past history of owning Hoovers many years ago.Things sure have changed! I just came in from toting this piece of JUNK out to the trash. I've owned it for about 6 months now. Each time I took it out for a spin- about once a week- something would invariably break off: the carpet height adjuster, the carpet/floor knob. The noise sounded like, and I'm not kidding, an extremely loud pile of plastic parts being trampled by a bull. The belts created a stench of burning rubber, and needed replacement way too often!Save your money- Do Not Go Near this Beast."
3,Cute idea,"I like the idea of this toy but it isn't that exciting. Nice that everything is all together but because nothing comes off the house there isn't anything to move and play with. I think my daughter would have had more fun with a pop-up house that has moving furniture. Also, maybe it said in the description and I missed it but this Kelly doll is extra big, not the normal size of a Kelly doll. I was hoping she could play with all her Kelly sized dolls in the house."
4,Remedy Skin Repair Cream,"My dad was first given this product by nurses who were caring for my mother, who is stricken with Alzheimer's. The cream is known to repair skin tissue. One day, while visiting, I had a pimple on my face and my dad smeared a dab on it. I could not believe the results, because the next day the pimple was almost completely gone. Since then, I used this cream on areas that are resistant to my usual remedies. Now I go to this product for everything. It's amazing."
5,Best,"I have sensitive skin and was given a tube of this while in the hospital. It was the best I have ever tried, including much more expensive products from my dermatologist. It has a surprisingly pleasing scent as well that isn't perfumey or overwhelming for either men or women. It smells clean. I was a little surprised there was any scent - but it didn't bother me. They also sell a skin sheild product and I can't tell much difference and it's the same price."
5,Great!,Rec'd in excellent condition...the mailing fee was a bit high...but very pleased with the product.
2,Medline Remedy Skin Repair,Works great for skin repair. Flovent inhalation aerosol caused skin to become very thin. Medline helped prevent tears in the skin.
5,Great for Dry Cracked Skin,"I was introduced to this product while in New Mexico when my father became ill. They used this in the rehab facility. My own hands get cracked from eczema plus I was in very dry part of the country. I started using this several times a day and was amazed at the results. My hands cleared up. I love it. I searched online for it, found it and ordered it. It is well worth it."
5,I would recommend for anyone.,My mom is suffering from a host of health issues and taking quite a few medications. One of her medications is plavix which makes her skin bruise quite easily. She has has papery skin which is easy to tear. This cream has made her skin more resistant to tearing and seems to help the bruising fade faster when it occurs. She has been very happy with it. She says it has a great smell. My aunt has also been using it on her hands. She works in a factory on an assembly line that packs frozen foods. She says it has helped her hands stay less dry and keeps them from cracking. This product was recommended to me by a wound care specialist and I have been very happy.
3,Excellent cream but would not recommend it for faces.,"I have super sensitive skin, especially on my face. I bought this after I foolishly got a sunburn and wanted to reduce the damage. This is a good product in that it nourishes the skin and isn't greasy. It is one of the few creams that I can put on my face and hands and it not sting. I have that reaction to some hypoallergenic products even. I have just two complaints about it. First is it's causing breakouts on my face. Its great for the body and hands but I would not recommend it for faces because apparently it clogs the pores and pimples develop. Secondly is the scent. My husband says I smell like WD-40. I wish it was unscented."
5,The BEST - Amazon Verified Purchase,I have very dry skin. I have never been so pleased with any skin cream or lotion. I have tried countless brands over the years. The scent is pleasant and doesn't linger. My skin feels and looks nourished. Best of all it stays that way all day.I have become extremely skeptical with skin repair creams/lotions because of all the disappointments I have encountered. I debated about ordering the 32 oz. bottle. I am thankful I did. I use it daily.
5,Super product!,This lotion really helps the dry skin dilemma. I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin. The fragrance is lovely but not overwhelming!
5,great skin product,This skin lotion is great. It stays on even after hand washing. I use it in my work place and at home.
5,Great skin cream,I have eczema on my hands and this does not sting like some lotions. This lotion is very soothing!Definitely worth a try.
1,That's 10 hours I'll never be able to get back.,"Looking back, I think it was my philosophy to finish a job that got me through the series, and not the books themselves. Or to put it more gently, this is the last time I listen to my sister's (Lilanne) recommendations. The series was like a soap opera commercial, tempting to draw the audience with tentalizing titbits but really do not go anywhere or add up to anything but a long and drawn out tale with an ending that is very fitting........for a Harlequin romance. At least we all know that romance endings are not unexpected or original. The hankie that Lilanne gave me along with books is still, just like the books themselves, dry. If Mr. Kay want his readers to fill in where his imaginations lack, then he succeeded."
3,Derivative fantasy,"I've loved Guy Gavriel Kay's other books, especially Tigana and A Song for Arbonne. But I didn't read them right away, because I had read this earlier, very derivative fantasy and thought the others would be the same.Not much more to say. Read Joy Chant's far more evocative Red Moon, Black Mountain, published some years before the Fionavar Tapestry. Chant covers much the same ground as Kay, albeit in a single volume with no elves, dwarves or contrived Arthurian references."
4,The best book of the trilogy,A nice ending to a competent fantasy. Others may like this series better than I did-I find all fantasy pales next to Tolkein. But this one at least is (mostly) well written and even breaks out in originality here and there! I look forward to reading more of Kay's work.
1,"Overly dramatic, poorly done","I'm a big fan of fantasy, and a friend recommended this series to me. I read the entire Fionavar Tapestry on vacation when I had no access to any other books. While the premise was initially intriguing, the author's writing abilities severely hampered any empathy you had for the protagonists' struggles. He incessantly reminded you that the characters were burdened with a personal, unspeakable grief so terrible that I was amazed any of them were able to get out of bed each morning. I'd only recommend this if you were had plenty of time on your hands and no other reading material available."
4,Very good but some small problems,"The interweaving of myth and new story is very well done. Not everything turned out exactly as I may have wished, but most of the ending was satisfactory (except that I don't think the potential love interest between Kim and Dave at the end worked out completely - there really was not much to point toward it before). All in all, it was a good fantasy trilogy that I enjoyed reading."
2,Not as fine as you think,"I got this and its course grater cousin to replace two aging and now dull Microplane Professional graters. They are not nearly as sharp as they should be. When zesting citrus, they tear into the skin, snagging a lot of pith. I am sure they are fine for mincing garlic and ginger, bu the Microplanes did it all."
3,Nice and Easy,"Beautifully sung and played album. However, with the exception of a Vernon Duke tune an Ellington song, the material is 2nd rate smooth jazz, albeit sung and played beautifully. I wish Nancy would continue to sing standards and take an adventurous turn and sing something like Guttel's ""Dividing Day"" or Finn's ""I'd rather be sailing""."
2,Blue made me Blue,"This album shows sadly that Nancy has lost her pipes, albeit ever so slowly. She misses as many as she hits. The arrangements are good and the surrounding cast is excellent with Bob Mintzer, James Moody , Tom Scott and many others and the artwork is superb! She looks great in the photos, and maybe that's good enough reason to buy it. But the singing is poor and her choice of numbers isn't so great either. I suspect that if she would keep it light and moving along at a faster swing-type tempo, as say Sinatra did at the end, she would sound better. Still a very classy lady though."
2,Time to Retire,"As an ardent fan of Nancy Wilson for 43 years, I've always looked forward to each of her new recordings. As noted elsewhere on this site, I feel her Grammy winning RSVP was probably her best recording ever. Period. Turned to Blue? I'm amazed at how much her voice has deteriotated in just three years. Time to hang up the vocal chords, Nancy."
4,I guess we're all getting older!,"This is a fantastic album! Has kind of a theme of getting older with some familiar standards and some that were new to me. Nancy has never been better, and she was always fabulous. I strongly recommend giving it a listen.Neal"
3,It's All in the Eyes!,"My daughter likes this doll, but she was a little dissappointed when she opened the package and noticed her eyebrows. My daughter felt the eyebrows make Yasmine look mean and there is one stray hair on both sides! They need to be plucked or waxed."
1,This Yasmin is not as pretty as you think,"When I saw this Yasmin on the computer I thought she was really pretty,But when I went to go get her at the store she was ugly. I mean her hair and outfit was okay but her make-up was UGLY!they should of put glitter on her eyes it would looked a little better and the lipstick should have been a pale pink.So besides spending $20.00 on this doll I bought a MyScene goes hollywood madison."
1,where's kiana?,"Okay, i went on the bratz website and there was a kiana wild wild west. Bring her out.I want to see her on this website! she is so much more prettier. all the other wild wild west bratz look like someone has replaced their mascara with super glue. they look surprized! especially that dana, by the way, the worst one ever made! whats up with that hoe style?so this yasmin is pretty average looking, yeah she's cool, but not as pretty as kiana. i suggest getting her, well, if you can find her!they always make the best bratz dolls hard to get!"
4,I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT THIS DOLL,"NOW I REALLY LIKE HER. SHE HAS LONG BEAUTIFUL BROWN HAIR, PRETTY MAKE-UP AND 2 VERY STYLIN' OUTFITS. I LOVE THE COWBOY HAT AND BOOTS. I AM ADDING HER TO MY WISH LIST. SHE'S A COOL DOLL. 4 STARS."
3,GORGEOUS BEAUTY,"This is an absolutely beautiful doll!!!love the long long hair,the 2 fashions and hat are also as pretty as the overall doll.A WELL SPENT AMOUNT FOR THIS GORGEOUS BEAUTY OF A DOLL!!!"
1,"""Macedonian"" awakening?","The book of Mr. Seraphinoff is a work of doubtful value. How has he studied the works of the ""Macedonian"" awakener Pejchinovich, when on several occasions Mr. Seraphinoff admitted that he speaks very bad Bulgarian/Macedonian? Obviously, the aim of Seraphinoff is to prove the ""Macedonian"" character of Pejchinovich's works. However, Pejchinovich himself calls his language ""Bulgarian"" and his country ""Lower Moesia"". Seraphinoff appears to be one of those scholars who were deceived by Yugoslav propaganda to assert the existence of a Macedonian nation and his book is just another example of falsification of Bulgarian history."
5,great for the price!,I got this for a total of five dollars and 41 cents at walmart. It works great so far and curls my relaxed hair fine. The types of curls you get varies with the amount of hair that you curl at a time. I own the 3/4 inch as a reference.
3,Not so hot.,It does not get hot enough to make LASTING curls which is key! It might be a fitting purchase for a teen just starting out with curling irons.
3,curling iron,"I have very short, fine hair and I had difficulties with this iron gripping it tightly enough to curl. I had to be very careful with each curl to be sure the hair would stay in."
4,Great curling iron,This curling iron works great and the price was good. I would recommend this product to others and would purchase again.
3,Curling Iron,"It will do for emergencies. The barrel does not have a strong spring and therefore does not hold the hair that you are attempting to curl very tight, making for a poor curl at best onshort hair."
1,Where's the heat?,"No matter how long you let this curling iron heat up, it never gets hot enough for the curl to set."
1,Conair 5/8 inch curling iron,"I have had this curling iron for about 8 months, used it about 1 time weekly, and it has already broken apart. It was only used by myself, no children, so it wasn't abused. The arm just broke off inside the handle."
1,curling iron,"Would not buy again. Cheap 5/8"" plasticcurling iron. Price was $14 somethingbut it was not worth the money.Also I received a ""scam"" email afterpurchasing this item."
5,Snug as a bug in a rug,"They do what they're designed to do and if I do say so myself, they look good doing it."
2,Huge and Uncomfortable,"I like Juicy Couture products. The quality is good and I love the little whimsical details. These sunglasses were no exception; they came with a really nice case and cute cleaning cloth. The glasses were sturdy and well made, too. However, they were HUGE. I love big sunglasses, but these made me look like an alien or a bug. My boyfriend teased me relentlessly about them. To make matters worse, the lenses are really curved, so they actually dug into my cheekbones and made red marks on my face after only a few minutes. They're nice glasses, but they went back!"
5,Good to get you pumped up,This CD features songs that are very well developed and played. There are very good guitar solos. The singing gets you going and the playing keeps you pumped. I reccomend this CD to everyone that likes rock or blues.
2,So-so,Singer sounds like Elvis reincarnate-but not as good.The instruments are great though-very southern rock.Try it again!
5,awesome!,"I love the MT, and for me, this is one of their best albums! NO matter what I am doing, I can always get something different from this one...it has it all. The only album better for me is the Anthology set."
5,Beautiful music and politically correct: soul food to go,"Rich, very evocative collection of exciting music from Brazil: in the group's hands the music becomes a vehicle for issues like ecology; the South African struggle for freedom; the beauty and wonder of the earth's resources, like water; and the dilemma of who the earth should serve: future generations, as the earth-savers would remind us, or the hungry mouths of the present, as the cattle-raisers and the clearers of the land would have it. An important time capsule of present-day concerns. On the artistic side, the consistent excellence of the quartet is graced by the vocals of Jhabvan and the work of Brazil's finest new composers like Ivan Lins and others."
2,Just plain bad.,"If you're into dance covers like me, and interested in purchasing this cd, there are some things you should know:*There are only 12 songs on here that are real dance covers. ""I swear"" is not.*Some are like those cover songs that has different rap lyrics imbedded into them. It's My Party(and I'll cry if I want to) is one of them.*However, there are some good ones like Upside Down(definitely), One of Us, Don't Speak, and Time After Time.So, think twice before purchasing this album."
5,Good game at a great price,My 3 year old who wants to play our PS3 was acctualy distraced enough by this game to leave the PS3 alone and play her Vtech Vsmile. She loves it and it is easy enough for her to play and not get frustrated...which is a bonus to me.
1,Noddy gets NAUGHTY,"We bought our 4-year old daughter this V.Smile NODDY video game for Christmas 2006. One particular section of the game involves the child to complete pre-arranged words displayed on the screen. To get right to the point, I nearly fell off the couch when then word SEXY was displayed as part of the game sequence. Perhaps the manufacturer hasn't heard of a WORD FILTER. What's next, F**K?I have a photograph of the TV showing this exact scene. If Amazon allows me to post the image, I will gladly share it. I intend to also share with the manufacturer, once I locate their website.SEXY is one of the four-letter words I would prefer not to explain to a 4-year-old child."
4,A question of taste,"This is my only hard rubber mouthpiece, you can get a big sound, nice and round, with full body. However, after a few months I went back to my old Berg Larsen metal mouthpiece. But I used this mouthpiece to record a ballad, and it really goes well with my vintage King Marigaux '73"
3,Wrong picture of product,"Actually the picture shown on the website is different from the actual products. This is without the green-tea extract!!! The picture is mixed-up with another product, please correct it!!"
2,STILL waiting,"i orded this product a few days ago..said i would recieve it on a thursday, my other products took my payment, shipped very quickly, 3 days later recieved my packages..with this, TOOK MY PAYMENT 2,3 DAYS LATER SHIPPED MY PACKAGE AND IM STILL WAITING ""THERES A DELAY"" WTF IS THAT? LAZY SELLER- NEVER AGAIN I'LL ORDER FROM VITAMIN SHOPPE INSTEAD"
5,Excellent,"I don't work out just had a baby 8 months ago weighed 118 before then 142 after. I am very active but getting the weight off not so easy. For the price I figure I would try these. OMG curved my eating habits wasn't alot as it was,but helps out more. I don't feel tired for eating less and have given me more energy to take care of a very active 8 month old. I have only been taking 1 to 2 a day with one meal and it makes me less hungry next meal time well any meal time now once I started taking them. I have lost 5 lbs already in 3 weeks. It is good by me for not going to the gym and a walk every now and then hope you have just as good luck."
5,Great!,I really like this! It has already curved my appetite. It does not leave a taste in your mouth after taking it either!! I have already ordered more!
5,Excellent product,"I have been using this product for about two weeks. I recently started dieting and exersising this past week and have actually lost 4-5 pounds. Although, I am dieting and running 3 miles per day, the pills definitely suppress my hunger and give me more energy to work-out. I definitely think this pills will help lose weight, but you also have to excersise in order to really experience the weight loss."
5,works for me,"I have had these for about a week. They do work good as an appetite supressant throughout the day , for me at least. I don't own a scales , but I can tell I have lost a few pounds. It's not a miracle , but it does give you more control on what and how much you eat. Has cut down my desire for carbs , and food in general, a good thing! I take 2 with each meal. I have ordered 2 more bottles (from another site). I love these so far and hope they continue to work!EDIT: I quit taking this a long time ago . About 2 weeks after taking these , I started feeling weird , like not myself. I also started getting nauseous about an hour every time I took one. After I stopped taking them , I felt like myself and no more nausea. Don't know what happened , but I am wondering about the safety of these pills now. I say take at your own risk."
3,The Associate,Whoppie beats out the establishment. Strong female characters. Breaking through the glass ceiling.
4,Whoopi as she is!,"I like Whoopi, her sense of timing is just so good. This movie was entertaining in that as a woman who has worked in company administration I could relate to the frustration. In order to be given credit due, it is still necessary to do everything the men do a little better and in high heels! So creating a male colleague who ends up taking all the credit seemed like a perfectly normal thing. All the chain reactions were just added fun."
1,unable to watch movie,"attempted to play movie in 3 different dvd players, all read playback prohibited by area limitations. Have never received that message before. Do not know what it means. Maybe you can explain. One of my favorite movies."
5,Very Entertaining!,I truly love this movie! I have been trying to get it on DVD eversince I first watched it in March 1997 on my way to the UK. Whoopi Goldberg's acting is convincing but I liked Dianne Wiest's supporting role. A very entertainingly funny plot will keep you laughing most of the time through the whole movie.
5,Excellent. Good Comedy with great actors,Would highly recommend this film. The actors are believable and the plot line is very funny.
3,Not a Great Comedy but Sometimes genuine humor film.,"Wall street analyst (Oscar-Winner:Whoopi Goldberg) cannot survived in the World Business Men. So, she sets up with a Phony Fictitious business male partner and she decide to dress herself as a Man!This Comedy is a Remake from a French 1982 film. Goldberg is Quite Good in the lead. Great suppoting cast:Including-Two Time Oscar Winner:Dianne Wiest, Eli Wallach, Timothy Daly, Bebe Neuworth, Austin Pendleton and Lainie kazan. Directed by Donald Pertie (Grumpier old men) has made a good comedy but he has made funnier films that this one. Grade:B."
2,Badly acted; not very entertaining,Any one who has the faintest inkling of how Wall St works will find this movie a joke. I can't believe the other reviews giving four or five stars. I was very disappointed with the whole thing. Whoopi seems very uninvolved in her acting. The movie just drags and drags. Many of the so called comic scenes are very contrived.
5,Hilariously funny!,"This movie gets funnier each time you see it. Whoopi Goldberg is at her best in this movie. Everyone should see this movie at least once. Believe me, you will want to see it again."
2,I found it to be biased and dated,"It's hard to find a travel book that is more than a list of hotels but less than a travelog. I thought this book was it -- but I was wrong. Boyde Lafayette De Menthe writes as if every American doesn't want to experience the real Japan. And describes the real Japan is some sort of secret brothel.Some of the history was interesting and the quick guide to the language was informative but, overall, the information was very dated (copyright 1995). And as a woman who loves to travel, this book left me with very few insights other than where I should sent my male companions at night."
1,Please don't spend your money,"Please don't waste your time or money on this book. There are much better books available (I have lived in Japan for 5 years and didn't see anything remotely approaching insightful or original commentary). I thought this book would give me tips on how to experience the Japan of old -- which is hard to find. Instead I got a variety of short stories (none of which I found interesting or provide enough detail for you to figure out how to find the romantic old Japan), and an abbreviated history of Japan. Also, the author is always obsessing about women! I recommend to keep searching!"
5,church,We needed a replacement for the church snare and we do not have a local music store. So after surfing the net an found this product and for the price we had to order it. It is just what we need and received it on time for the next service. We always have a great experience with amazon.
1,Great Fiction; Awful History,"For any one who has more than a basic knowledge of Japanese history, this book is bunk. However, if one reads it as fiction, it makes for superb ""summer beach reading"". The fact that the picture on the cover is of the Emperor of China (after the fall of the Manchu dynasty and his ""enthronement"" as the Emperor of Manchuria), not the Emperor of Japan shows just how much the author knows about this subject."
3,about that dust jacket photo :),"There was a quarrel in these reviews about the gentleman shown on the dust jacket of Yamato Dynasty, with one reviewer claiming it was not Hirohito but the former ""boy emperor,"" later Emperor Pu Yi of Manchukuo (best known as the hero of the film The Last Emperor).Well, I just now picked up a copy of Kempeitai by the British author Ramond Lamont-Brown, and the identical photograph (in black & white) appears on page 59, and captioned ""His Imperial Majesty, Pu Yi, Emperor of China, 1908-12""Of course, Lamont-Brown could be mistaken, but I am inclined to think that it was the publishers of Yamato Dynasty who made the howler. After all, the photo doesn't even look like Hirohito as an adult."
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","This is one of the most pathetic pieces of ""history"" I've ever read. ""Documents show"" and ""sources indicate"" is not documentary evidence. Who were the sources, where are the cites? This is bad journalism, bad scholarship, and bad history. The writing, frankly, isn't that impressive, either. And for the record, the cover photo *is* P'u Yi, not Emperor Showa. Look at the uniform; the Chinese dragons on the collar are a dead giveaway even if you can't tell the faces are different, which they clearly are. I want to rate this book ZERO stars, but the Amazon Powers That Be have not provided the option to so brand a book, so please ignore the star and pretend you see a hole there."
2,"How Wall Street, Hoover and McArthur conspired to cover up for the emperor","This book on the 'history' of the dynasty that rules Japan suffers from its own sloppy sensationalism. It is not entirely useless, but nearly so. It kills its interesting subject by its manic devotion to conspiracy theories.Probably the authors are entirely innocent of the cover blunder, but it is somehow symptomatic: the cover photo is not even a Japanese, not remotely a member of the dynasty that gave the book its title, but a Chinese and probably the last emperor, Pu Yi, the monarch of Manchukuo, poor man.Seagrave wrote some interesting popular history books on China, mainly his Soong Dynasty and his book about the Empress Dowager are worth reading as an introduction to 20th century China. But forget this Japan book. Better to try Herbert Bix on Hirohito (who, by the way, does not even mention Hoover in the context of Hirohito's post WW2 predicaments)."
1,Can we say yellow journalism?,"This is the first of the Seagrave's books I have read. It will be the last. I picked it up thinking that it was written by Japanese scholars. After reading the preface and realizing the authors were investigative reporters, I was a bit turned off, but decided to continue reading.In the first chapter, the Seagraves present as fact details of ancient Japanese history that are still being debated within Japanese scholarship, both foreign and domestic. While there is likely some modicum of truth in what the Seagraves have to say, I find it difficult to take their accusations at face-value, in light of the incorrect history which is presented as fact. I don't think I could ever take seriously the work of such journalists who, from their other book credits, seem to be capitalizing on the ""scandals of Asia"" without truly having studied any of the Asian cultures they are writing about."
5,"beautifully written, lucid biography",The British royalty and their scandals have nothing on the Japanese and theirs. This is a delicious biography that reveals layer after layer of history and intrigue. Highly recommended.
1,Chinese Emperor,"On a recent trip to Hong Kong, I noticed that the edition there has a crysanthemum crest on the cover, instead of a photo. I am Japanese and the photo is definitely the Chinese emperor, not Emperor Showa. Maybe the author realized that Asians could tell the difference but that Americans would not.Anyways, would you trust a tour book for London that had a photo of the Eiffel Tower on the cover?That said, I enjoyed the book, sort of like reading the National Enquirer and Star at the check-out line at the market."
2,Embarrassingly shallow,"I am not a historian. I am someone who reads history and who has a great deal of respect and admiration for Japan, its society, and its complexity. I bought this book before boarding a long flight and looked forward to learning more about the Imperial dynasty and its role in the great historical dramas. Instead, I spent my time reading a largely unsubstantiated attack. Even allowing for the author's rather extreme point of view, I found the book embarrassingly shallow, mean, and totally one-sided. Other than a few vignettes about some of the members of this mysterious and underreported family, this book offers little."
3,Nice fiction,"Tightly written and easy to read. Interesting subject, though not quite that secret. It is good to have a basic history of the Japanese Imperial family. And it is interesting to see the interaction with American public persons. MacArthur: He grew up in a log cabin out West, surrounded by hostile Indians. Maybe that gave him an inferiority complex. Churchill and Roosevelt conniving to get the US actively into a war the people did not really want. FDR as Secretary of the Navy after World War I, assessing the military situation in the Pacific: When the Japanese attack, it will be at Pearl Harbor.The book is a nice read but, please, do not take it as documented history."
3,"A good read, but. . .","It is always nice to see an ""outsider"" write something which challenges much of the orthodoxy of Japanese history. This is particularly so with a subject such as the imperial family, where the freedom of expression of people in Japan to write freely and bluntly about the subject is kept in check by the threat of, well, death, among other things.That said, the Seagraves do not read Japanese and rely heavily on sources that do not either (e.g. books such as ""Sheathing the Sword"" and ""Soldiers of the Sun""). So much of what they rely on is filtered. So, as serious scholarship goes, its all rubbish. But readable, tantalizing and entertaining rubbish. If even 20% of what they assert is true then the assertions are worth keeping in the back of one`s mind when looking at more traditional historical works."
1,This Rocky Music is Dead On Arrival,"In a complete departure from previous Rocky movie soundtracks, this album is mostly a collection of vocals by various artists. It has none of the inspiring instrumental themes common to Rocky , Rocky II, and Rocky III, composed by the legendary Bill Conti. Listening to this album, there is nothing that distinguishes it as a Rocky movie soundtrack. I found nothing endearing whatsoever in this collection. The album is a KO in that it is dead on arrival. I do not recommend it.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
2,Rocky V Original Soundtrack (Limited 15th Anniversary Ed.?),"What was so special about it from the reg. version soundtrack?Why in the past was this worth $45.? This soundtrack has no feel about Rocky. Part of a series on film involves music. All these rap tracks were garbage. I can't watch Rocky and have it affiliated with rap. The only song I liked was ""Measure of a Man"" by Elton John. That track pretty much sums up the Rocky Saga. I hope they use that track again in ""Rocky Balboa"". Speaking of which; I hope there aren't that many rap tracks in that one as well. The only reason of purchase... Is because I'm a ""Rocky Fan"". Enough said..."
5,Worth the money and time,"I ordered several scholarship books, some based on reviews, some by description. This books is worth the money I spent on it. It is easy to access scholarships which pertain to you and all of the information regarding addresses, websites, etc seems to be correct. It takes time to go through any scholarship book but this one seems to be easier than most to scan. I have a good point of reference with this book."
5,work out for elderly,"Picked up for a old friend of mine. She just loves it. Its has helped her restore some of her muscle tone that she lost when she was sick. She uses it everyday for her arms and legs and hopes that soon she will be moving as good as she use to ,and back to her old self."
4,Good choice,"There are so many of these for sale it was hard to decide. But this one turned out just fine. You have to sit in the right chair and get the correct angle, but it does the trick while I'm sitting at my desk and need to exercise for an arthritic hip. No, it's not silky smooth, but it's certainly smooth enough.The only problem: when not in use the pedals flip so the base part is up and the strap is down. it's hard to get your feet in them without bending over and holding the pedals upright while you slide in your feet. It's cumbersome and this may make it hard for someone who can't make that motion."
1,Undurable.,I received this the day before Halloween of 2011. It lasted a little over two months and broke within the first week of January. It broke off at the location where the the bike was welded onto the stand.
1,Wow that broke fast!,"I've had this item since June 2011. Today the weld on one of the pedals just popped straight off. I'm not sure if I used it too much for too long or what, but this item does not have the duration it should for the price that I paid. I recommend that you don't use it for more than 10 minutes at a time if you get it, in order to let it cool off. I'm guessing mine broke from heat stress. Anyone have any recommendations for one that is more durable????"
2,No mettle in this peddlar,"In less than six months since I began using this product, one of the pedals came off. This was the second time I bought this item (on Amazon) and had the same problem each time.I only ordered it a second time because I assumed the first one was a fluke.Apparently the poor welding of the peddles onto the frame can't take the heat generated after only dozens or so uses because this item is poorly constructed!"
4,"Lots of information, but a little dated","Professor Bamforth teaches an awesome beer and brewing class at UCD. Sadly his book is not as great and entertaining as his lecture. If you are an aspiring brewmaster, find a more in-depth book on beer. If you want to learn how to brew your own beer, find something on the internet. If you want to familiarize yourself with how beer is made and classified, along with impressing your friends at the bars, try this book out - its not that expensive and full of introductory material. The book is a little dated, most of the information about international brewing companies is quite outdated. Still, the general process of making beer hasn't drastically changed much over the past few centuries."
5,"BEER, needs no other introduction.","A very detailed primer with a wealth of information. IF this is a text book for a course I want to go back to college, especially if I can sample the course material as I study. I found it very informative and an easy read. My interest is in developing an on farm brewery and the information in Beer has been really helpful in getting me off dead center on a number of aspects of brewing. I'm sure that simply reading this book has prevented me from several potentially costly missteps. Having the advantage of Mr Bamforths' knowledge to draw on from this book makes it already a reference that I have returned to several times. I'm sure that as I move forward with my brewing hobby I'll continue to revisit BEER."
3,Beer: Tap into the art,"This book is definitely biased toward more ""traditional"" methods of brewing as the author is older and from England where the noble hops seem to reign and everything he says does not fully fit into the context of American micro or craft brewers. So if you don't know about the many wonderful beers made in America that push the boundaries of flavor and balance, this book isn't for you unless you really really like specific data on brewing. This is a great reference resource on the hard data of brewing up until this book was published and can help more knowledgeable brewers expand their knowledge base, but this is not for the home-brewer necessarily."
5,Wish they would make these again!,"I don't know why they stopped making these - they are the only ""one-hand closure"" tongs on the market. They are terrific."
1,A disappointing book on a fascinating subject,"This book attempts to put the the theory of 'maternal impressions' into the context of 18th century society and medical thinking. In particular, it recounts the case of Mary Toft, a woman from Godalming in Surrey who claimed to give birth to numerous rabbits! It is clearly the result of considerable research, but the author is very far from a 'natural writer' and bores his audience throughout. A generous helping of turgid sociological commentary throughout does not help matters. I can now understand why this book semms to have sunk without a trace soon after publication."
3,Too subtle,"This book had 23 stories, no introduction and no story copyright page. There was no way of telling when they were written. I liked the sister book-Tales of the Uncanny and Supernatural better. This volumne's tales were 'hit or miss'. I thought the pace on some of them were too slow, and on others as though I missed the point. Worthwhile for those of us who like this type of writing--Blackwood's grammer, sentence structure and style are always top notch."
2,All steps are choreographed,"This video is full of choreographed steps. It does not teach you how to dance the tango. ""Tango the Soul""? I would not recommend it to beginners, maybe for advanced dancers looking for new steps."
2,Satisfy the desire,"I get no satisfaction when watching this video. It is very polished and choreographed. But too much make-up, if you know what I mean. Too artistic and orchestrated. Not many real people dance like that."
2,To the right or to the left,"This video is all about memorizing specific steps. For example, it teaches ""an intricate turning sequence to the right and left"". Well, what if I wanted to do it first to the left and then to the right. Is it possible? Basically speaking, this video teaches the old-fashioned way - memorize these steps with these names, and then if you want more steps, we'll make another video. How about teaching tango as an improvisational dance, which it really is, and teaching the universal lead and follow technique, with some basic concepts that will allow anybody to just dance with anybody."
4,Realize your potential (It's better than you think!),"For the past several years, I've worked tirelessly at golf. However, my improvement was minimal. I'd previously read Mr. Gallwey's book but never took it that seriously and basically abandoned his suggestions from this book whenever I hit a bad shot (Self 1 saying ""well, that doesn't work!""). I entered my club championship and I felt that I would play well. The first day I struggled to an 85, playing the same way I had for the past few years (decent golf swing but no results). The next day, I came in with zero expectations and told myself that I would trust ""Self 2"" to play the game. The result was a 70, my first competitive round under 80, let alone under par!In summary, combine a firm grasp of the fundamentals (I find that Mr. Gallwey's learning method works well here) with the mental attitude that he stresses in this book, and you will be very happy playing this game."
3,"Interesting read, but...","Hm. I must be a bit more skeptical than the others who have reviewed this book. What I'd like to know is if any of them found LASTING improvement to their golf games by following Gallwey's tips. For example, using the ""Back-Hit"" mantra may serve to clear your mind during the golf swing initially; but will it really transform your game in a permanent way?Again, the book is interesting and worth reading if you're looking for a non-traditional way to lower your golf score. I just wonder about the long-term benefits, that's all."
4,The Mind Game,"It is one of those books that concentrate on golf as a mind game. It is helpful in explaining why golf shots are difficult to repeat and we should not try to do so. Instead, look at every shot afresh and let the mind (called Self2)takes over. Self 1 is a critic and doubter and should be silenced if you are to improve your score.While my score has not improved yet, I am beginning to enjoy my swings and putts better. Hopefully, I can do what the author did - play only once a week and still break 80.Good read if techniques are getting you nowhere in your game."
4,trust your inner self,This book provides excellent guidance regarding trusting yourself to find the best of your game. The writing style is engaging. The writer becomes a mentor for you. This is a person you would like to know. You do come to know him as a friend and guide to a stress free approach to golf.
4,A Very Good Book on the Mental Side of Golf,"The ideas presented in this book are very useful for golfers who are developing their golf swing and for those who already have a fully developed golf swing. Performing the mental exercises suggested in the book expands your prespective of what is involved in swinging a golf club. Combine the mental exercises with good mechnaics and the benefits magnify. This book is a worthwhile read and if you haven't read it, take the time to read it and try the exercises. A few thoughts from the author ofThe Golf Swing: It's All in the Hands."
5,Applying foucs to your golf game,"I re-read this book every couple of years, and enjoy it thoroughly. When a golfer has studied all the technical swing mechanics books, seen all the lesson videos and taken every tip from every source, he/she still needs to learn how to prepare himself mentally to play the game, and more importantly - improve his game. This book makes it possible to improve rapidly and to continue improving."
5,SUPERB,I love Market Spice green and black teas they are second to NONE! The unique cinamon/orange flavors are very soothing and at the same time stimulating w/o the harmful types of more common energy drinks.
4,A nearly perfect MP3-CD player,"I have previously used Philips Expanium portable MP3-CD players exp103, exp201, exp303, and most recently exp503. I was very pleased with the last two (after initial disappointments with exp103 and exp203). So I bought their most recent product, exp325. This one has given me the same disappointment as exp103, that you cannot search within an MP3 track. Exp203 used to skip within songs, because it did not have Magic-100 ESP, that all other Philips products have.I am very impressed with this innovative feature of Philips, Magic-100 ESP, that it protects very perfectly your player from skips. I have been using it for nearly two years, and so far I have not even once experienced a skip. What more can I want?? Thank you Philips.I would have given full 5-star rating to this product, if it had search function for MP3 tracks."
3,Mixed Bag but Worth It,"Lovely cover. Some of the music might appear shallow or schmatlzy. Maybe I'm not used to this kind of music. Tracks 1, 7-8, 10-11 are the best ones here. Good vocalist. Thought Avril Lavigne was the only kind of music you could bob your head to? Try Track 10. Try also the smart-alecky Track 8. The last track is a great way to end. As to instrumentation, the musicians do seem to know their style of music very well."
1,Eastbay sucks,"After waiting over 2 weeks and shoes did not arrive, I contacted the company to track the package, but I was informed that the package could not be tracked and it must have been lost in shipment. The ahoes are no longer in stock, so now I must wait for money to be credited back to my account which they say may take up to 2 more weeks. This was a very disappointing experience with poor service. I do not plan to order from them in the future."
2,Challenging Product but WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I ordered the USB 8 inch Digital Photo Frame, it arrived very quickly along with instructions. Being an older grandmother and not part of the cyber generation I tried and tried to get it to work. With no luck and little hair left I went on line to the companys web sight and got there phone number for Tech support.I have to say in all honesty they tried long and hard to help me, we made many calls back and forth still no luck getting a photo onto the frame.I am so pleased with the customer service I can't tell you. In the end they shipped me an upgraded model, which is also sold on Amazon, at no charge and took the first one back. The new model is a dream. I just plugged it in and copied and pasted the photos to the image in my C drive and presto there was the working photo frame.So even though I found the first to hard for me It was the companys stand for customer service that I respect. They really stood behind the product."
1,Dwell Digital Well,Cannot load pictures and there is absolution no phone numbers no help on this product. Shame on Amazon for promoting this type of business. Anytime you spend over $200 you should be able to get a help line to walk you thru. If I can get it to work I'll respond again!!
1,Not worth the $$,"We bought this for my father for Xmas. We were able to load the pictures, but the computer often froze or crashed when it was connected. The picture quality stinks and rather than display them in the correct proportional size, the pictures are squished vertically and everyone looks like they lost 20 pounds. Not a great investment, unfortunately."
4,Works great,"It was really cheap and it works absolutely great. Multiple heat levels , turbo heat .The only thing is that the cord is a little bit too short, you have to plug in the brush on an outlet that is not too close to the groung"
5,Perfect Curling Iron For Short to Medium Hair,"Recently bought the Conair Instant Heat 3/4 Hot Brush. It is everything I'd hoped for, and more! It heats up very quickly, has a great adjustment for temperature, doesn't tangle, and is very comfortable to hold. It curls very easily, and brushes out smoothly. I feel like I should buy a spare. When you find something that good, at a good price, why not have an extra on hand?I would recommend this to anyone with short to medium hair. You never have a bad hair day with this little tool....."
5,DUAL VOLTAGE TREASURE,"Took this to Europe. Worked great both there and in US. My fine, shoulder length hair does not get tangled up in it. The heat settings give you great control and protection from burning the hair. And barrel the perfect size for me. Had a 1.5 inch-just didn't get enough curl."
1,Conair BC84SCS 3/4 inch hot brush,I bought this item in October 2008 and it is now January 2009 and it already doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Too big,Never try since purchasing. Too big to apply for medium hair. Not sure if this thing could help shaping at all.
2,Not for me...,"I didn't really like this one :( was hoping I would since it got so many great reviews, but it left my hair frizzy and with tons of flyaways :("
4,Great Curling Brush,"I was looking for a hot curling iron and bought this because of the great reviews. I love the way my hair looks when I just come out of the salon and this hot brush comes really close to giving me that look. It's great because it has a plastic tip that you can hold onto to help with the curling without burning yourself. You can also get pretty close to the scalp to tame those little fly-away hairs without burning your face or scalp as well. My only peeves were that it does not get as hot as I'd like it to and my hair is not as smooth as I thought it would be, it leaves my hair kinda frizzy at first. It gives really nice soft curls though. I recommend it"
5,love this curling brush!,"I had one of these prior for several years that I loved, as it is quick and easy to use, and the curl lasts. It can also be used to straighten and smooth by simply running the combed barrel down the length of the hair. From so much use, my husband had to repair the cord at one point on my old one. Was so glad this product was still available when my old one finally died. This one has a turbo setting that my old model did not, but I find the highest dial is sufficient anyhow. It heats up VERY quickly, which is great. I love that it turns off on its own, in case I forget. The top can be removed so you can slide out the combs and clean well when necessary."
3,"Cord, on/off switch","I completely agree with the other reviewer who said the cord isn't long enough. Also, I seem to accidentally hit the on/off switch while curling my hair - before I know it there isn't heat and I have to constantly turn it back on."
4,Very pleased,This Hot brush warms up faster than any I have ever used and I haven't burned myself once! Love the turbo feature and it really works!
3,Not having much luck in curling my hair,It's not helping me any in curling my hair. But it's very useful in touching up my hair. Straightening it and fluffing it a bit.It's a comb with heat. Easy to get your hair behave with it. So it's a 3 star from me.
4,glad to find it,"Have used this product for many years, they do eventually not heat as well after a few years and I have lost them while traveling, so I need to replace on occasion, but have not been able to find in local stores, fortunately the ""missing from the shelves items"" can be found on Amazon."
3,hot brush,this is not what I expected; thought it would blow air out through the wand but it just gets hot; works well but it's just ok.
1,Not recommended,"This hot brush worked great for about 6 months, then it worked intermittently, now it doesn't work at all.I would not recommend this product."
2,hmmm disappointed,"I have thick dry short hair and I expected this product could smooth my hair a bit,like what they do with brush and hair dryer at hair saloon,but It doesn't work for my hair at all...and it made my hair even kinda frizzy..."
3,Good not great,"Curling brushes are getting harder and harder to find. I try to buy the Conair brand, that is why I bought this one. So far it's o.k., prefer to have one that has a small stand to keep the hot iron off of surfaces when I put it down. This hairbrush does not come with a stand. I probably will not buy this one again unless it's the only one left to buy!"
5,A Great Hot Brush,This is my second Hot Brush from this manufacturer. My first one fell off the counter and cracked. I was able to find another one. I Love this hot brush. It has an adjustable heat setting and gives a nice curl or wave. I use it almost every day and find it does not dry my hair out like a curling iron has.
2,Burned out WAY too soon,"I loved this iron for the first two or three months it actually worked but after that I could leave it plugged in for even an hour and still be able to wrap my hand easily around the barrel.I'd love to buy a replacement but am very wary of this reoccurring - especially after the customer service at Conair was virtually useless, going so far as to tell me that they sold no such product!"
2,Conked out hot brush!,Used this for less than one year before it died on me! When it worked it was very effective! However it should have lasted much longer than it did!
2,Not what it says it is,"I ordered this thinking it was a ""3/4"" inch as advertised, but it's actually closer to 1/2"". Also the cord is VERY short. I couldn't use the brush unless I put the power strip on top of my dresser, it's that short!!If you use it in a bathroom w/the plug right next to you, it should be OK, but be aware, it's NOT 3/4""."
5,Best Hot Curler on the Market,I have used these for years to get a little body and curl in my straight hair. It is less harful to my hair than using the curler sets as you do not leave it in the hair very long. Compact and easy to travel.
5,Conair 1 1/4 inch Instant Heat brush,Heats up quickly and gives a loose curl to my fine hair. Teeth do not get caught in my hair.
2,No at all what I was hoping for!!,"I got this item for one of my daughters for christmas. She is mixed, and has thick, curly hair. I read many great reviews for this item, and decied it sounded like what we needed. I was WRONG!! The brush did absolutely nothing for her hair after I spent forever trying to make it work for her hair. This might be ok for people with fine, thin hair, but NOT for girls with thicker hair. I was very disappointed with this product!"
2,Didn't work for me,"This product didn't seem to work out for me. I was hoping that it would help to smooth out my hair and curl the ends, but it didn't seem to work on my hair."
5,Great buy!,I bought this for my mom has a birthday present and she LOVES it! She uses it everyday and doesn't have one complaint about it!! Plus it only took two days for it to ship! I would recommend it to anyone!!
5,Just what i wanted,I bought this because i just got my shoulder length hair permed and this helps take out some of the perm curl and give me a natural curl.
2,Conair instant Heat Hot Brush,"My hair is shoulder length and got really tangled with this hot brush. I wish is had some kind of release button. I turned on the turbo because normally my hair is difficult to curl. I should have tested it first because it senged a portion of my hair. Didn't realized how hot this brush would get, so be careful! I have resulted back to my nano flat irons, they make my hair much smoother. However, I will continue to play with this brush from time-to-time and perhaps, I will become better at using it."
2,Christmas present,"This was purchased for me at my request for a Christmas present 2011. Now June 2012, it no longer turns on. When I contact Conair for the 2 year warranty, well, yes, they'll fix it, but I have to pay shipping and handling. The shipping and handling is more then the brush was. The product worked great, while it worked, but no way should it have died within 6 months. =sighs= back to searching."
4,starts to pick up again in season 3,"3.1 and 3.2 are both quality boxes and the show seems to be pulling me in again (like the first season did), with more ""space scenes"" and some darker episodes with more battles. The stories seem to be a little more cohesive this season as well with less holes. There were a few in season 2 along with a couple bores. Also, there are more edible stand-alone stories (especially in 3.2).Kreis is becoming a good character, Scorpius got a little old (and confusing) though sometimes his character is interesting and complicated enough to draw me in. I'm not sure why, but the absence of Zhan may be a good thing. Aeryn is so effin hot, her straps carried the show for me at times, and the leather pants are Millimeters lower this season. yeehaw."
4,Good,"This DVD would not work in a lot of my friend's DVD players, I finally found one that accepted it. A little frustrating."
2,A bit under-inspiring,"This is a bit dated as aerobics music goes, especially since these days you can get exceptionally good mixes done by quality DJs. CD2 is better than 1, but generally it's all rather monotonous, and it can get hard to cue to music which seems almost uniformly even and has no definite chorus. As a group exercise instructor, I've been using these CDs primarily for beginner aerobics and sculpt classes only. Advanced participants won't get much kick out of them."
1,Spyware warning,"This CD crashed my computer, loading a damaging spyware which completely shut me down. Besides that, the music moves off phrase from time to time. My class didn't care for it too much, and neither did I."
1,Myoblast not worth it,"I have been taking myoblast since August of 2003 in conjunction with a heavy workout program and diet, I haven't gained any muscle, What has grown is the hole in my wallet, the company that produces this product claims muscle growth but I haven't seen any."
5,Best Darn Book on Slots Yet!,I can't believe that I finally a book that really says it like it is. Slot machines are a passion for me and I got all the books out there that tell me how to win. But Ian's book tells me how I am not winning. I got his book after hearing him interviewed on local radio station. I read the thing and I am amazed. I never knew how slots worked and now I know how. I used his hints just the other day and man it works! I didn't spend all my money and I did have a more happy time at the casino. Those other writers just promote fluff. Ian really does know what he is talking about. I know that this book will be a super best seller and too bad I can't give it 10 stars! Jeremy
4,Very Impressed with Book,"I bought this book from the reviews on Amazon and was very impressed by it. The only thing it lacks is pictures so that why I only gave it 4 stars, but the explanations of how slot machines work is very detailed and informative. I had to order this book from the publisher. I don't know why Amazon is not carrying it, even though it shows up when you look for slot machine books."
2,Misleading title,"The title of this video is simply a marketing thing. If you look at the names of the steps being taught here, you'll ask - where is the heart? I mean the steps are fine, but if you don't already know how to dance the tango, it's no use. If you already know how to dance the tango, you may already know these steps."
3,A little excited a little disapointed,"I bought these hopping to have frames for each kid in our VBS and take a picture of them so they could frame it. However these frames are ubber tinny and did not work well. Whatever goes in them has to be cut to size, or scaled down. Might be better for framing magazine pictures, or other types of crafts. All the accessories have been great for so many more projects. Still worth the $20 I paid."
1,"Dishonest title, not for beginners at all !","While McGuinn's artistry is excellent, this video's title is totally misleading - claiming ""Basic"" and ""Easy arrangements"" are totally untrue here. ""Basic /easy"" does not mean simultaneously flat picking and finger picking at 100 bpm. This isn't even structured as a learning video, its really a quick run through by an accomplished artist at full speed. A performance video for his fans perhaps but really not something a beginner could do. There's also some gratuitous shots of the peghead to let your know whose brand of guitar he's playing. If you have anything less than intermediate to advanced guitar skills you will be disappointed. Which is a shame because this publisher does put out some excellent learning tools (for example Steve Kaufman). Shame on them for misleading us on this one. Save your money !"
4,"Somewhere Beyond Beginner, But Very Enjoyable","I'd agree that this is beyond pure beginner level - but I think even the aspiring folk guitarist will find inspiration in Roger McGuinn's instruction and performance. Certainly playing ability and level are subjective measures, even so - perhaps ""advanced beginner"" or ""intermediate"" may be more appropriate ratings. But you will not be disappointed with the musicianship and Roger's obvious labor of love that these traditional songs represent. I loved ""The Water is Wide"" and have found that it's one that even a beginner might have success learning. And Mr. McGuinn does suggest that these can all be played with simple strumming; no advanced hybrid picking is really required. So grow into it!"
4,God doesn't heal people. Only man can do that.,"there was a great flood, and a man stood on his roof shouting ""the Lord will see me through."" A lifeboat came by, but the man refused to get on, saying ""I put all my faith in the Lord. He is powerfull and will not let me die."" The man drowned in the flood. When he got to heaven he confronted the Lord. ""Why did you let me die, oh Lord"" asked the man, ""I put all my trust in you."" Replied the Lord ""I SENT THE LIFEBOAT!"""
1,A test to all of God's children,"We each need to see who is most rightful and find out what is true!Although I disapprove of this book, I want to share with you readers that it strengthens me to see that ""the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself"" (Psalms 50:6).Remember, ""God is Love"" (I John 4:16). Best!"
1,"I feel sorry for the author. So much anger,so little love.",The resason many have left the Church is that they have choisen to follow the Manual and not The Board of The First Church Christ Scientist in Boston. The healings are still going on and so is the study. There are many students who use CS as a mental pill rather then UNDERSTANDING GOD. Even other religions are starting to see that the goal is to understand.Too bad she doesn't.
3,A mixed bag ... and a missed opportunity,"Interesting to see the reviews here oscillating between 5 stars and 1, which suggests that many readers had made up their minds before they opened the covers of this book. Fair enough. Christian Science is polarizing, as the author of this hapazard treatise makes plain.There's some really solid stuff in here -- some of it quite jolting, I'd think, to the ""dedicated Christian Scientists"" out there. Unfortunately, Fraser is neither a professional journalist nor a schooled historian, and she too evidently has an axe to grind. Someday, someone will write the definitive history of this fascinating and important American religion. This ain't it."
5,Best. Book. Ever. Period....,"...unless you are a Christian Scientist and don't like the church's dirty laundry being aired. Very thorough, well-researched and easy to read. Mrs. Eddy wouldn't want you to read it, but she probably won't haunt you from her grave if you do. Skeedly boop boop bee-yah!"
5,"a point of view, well expressed, beautifully written","I feel that this book succeeds almost perfectly in accomplishing its goal. It has a point of view which is clearly stated and is most brilliant in making accessible to the non-CS reader some of the historical and contemporary issues in the faith. I thought Fraser was very even handed in her sympathies to those reformers who have tried to heal the church. I did not come away with a negative opinion of CS but I do now have a better understanding of the faith as a whole. Fraser's book is a wake up call;I think the church could show a great deal of maturity by taking this critique and using it to constructively go forward. The CS church near where I live is sparsely attended and the membership is very old. It will not be long until it is silent. A great, thought provoking book!"
1,"Her view, her experience; definitely not mine!","A lifelong Christian Scientist and academic, I find Ms. Fraser's book misses the mark in virtually every respect. One who does not state correctly the basic facts and principles of any topic loses credibility when evaluating it. Every religion, however, has attackers and apologists. Also in the mix are individuals who will gather information widely and reach their own conclusions. To them I recommend SCIENCE AND HEALTH WITH KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES, the textbook of Christian Science by Mary Baker Eddy, as a good place to begin."
4,"A painful yet panoramic view, especially since 1910","As difficult at times as this book was to read for this supporter of CS, I had been sensing for some time that an expose' of this magnitude was somewhere out there lurking, just waiting for a writer with the courage to challenge the Board and set the record (reasonably) straight. Yes, some of the facts Ms. Fraser presents regarding the life of Mrs. Eddy can be called into question (what biography of a notable person HASN'T had this problem since the advent of the genre'?) but her account of institutional CS over the last 90 years is essentially correct. Still, upon completion of this tome, I couldn't help but notice that the following maxim still holds largely - and frustratingly - true: for those individuals of faith, no further proof is ever necessary; for non-believers, no further proof is ever enough."
1,DISBELIEF,It's sad what has happened to some of the kids who were victims of no medical treatment when they need it. I'm christian so I pray when someone I knows sick so I'm not totally knocking that Christian Scientist belive in healing . The real problem is their view on Christ. Mabye they should read Christ's words in the Bible instead of letting they're interpritation governed by Marry Baker Eddy. Who stole the idea from Professor Quimbly then claimed to have a revelation. It truly upsets me how many lives her lies have ruined.
5,Breakaway,"I think any former Christian Scientist who thinks they are free from its influence should read this book. I was a class-taught Christian Scientist, raised in the Sunday School, reader in the Org, CS Minister at NTC and county probation department honor camps, Sunday School teacher and executive board member at a branch church. I resigned all affiliations in 1980. However, after reading the book in one session, I realize that I agree completely with the quote on the back cover by Spaulding Gray: ""...For me God's Perfect Child acted like an excellent deprogramming map, freeing me from that demented magical world I thought I left behind."""
5,Secrets & Lies,"I marvel that Ms. Fraser got this book published. If you read this book, you too will marvel. I am a fourth generation, ex-Christian Scientist and the daughter of a CS practitioner. Ms. Fraser has provided me the missing link I have been searching for all my adult life. This book is the first chapter in the truth that will set me free. My life will forever be profoundly influenced by having read God's perfect Child and I recommend it as essential reading for others with backgrounds similar to mine."
4,Essential reading for any Christian Scientist,Beautifully written and excellently researched this book provides an invaluable way to question the Christian Science faith. It puts the religion in historical context and also how many of the teachers that shape our thought today were influenced by Mary Baker Eddy. I couldn't put this book down. Highly recommended.
1,Very poor. Inaccurate. Boring. A waste of time.,"It's too bad Amazon doesn't offer zero stars - that's what this book earned. Clearly, the author is writing a ""Mommy Dearest"" - and clearly she is clueless. The topic is dull, research shallow, and the author's bias'are showing. A waste of energy and thought both for author and reader."
1,"Just the facts, ma'am","If one were to seriously investigate the sources from which Fraser draws her conclusions, one would inevitably find that she has used sources that can only be described as ""yellow journalism"" - meaning that they serve no purpose but to discredit Mary Baker Eddy for discovering Christian Science and to blame her for the ""needless"" death of innocent children. If you compare the record of healing between the medical profession and Christian Science, it is clear that Christian Science has a pretty ""clean"" record. This is not to say that the medical profession has anything but the greatest intentions in there pursuits to ""fix matter"", but let's try basing our judgements on fact not fiction!"
2,"Entertaining? - Yes Accurate, authoritative? - No way","A great read, as much fiction is. But for an objective view or even an accurate one, it is hopelessly flawed.Based on an unhappy childhood and a dysfunctional family Ms. Fraser then takes a skewed view and compounds it with poor sources for biographical information about Mary Baker Eddy.Celebrity news is interesting; but one must question its veracity when so much of the other portions of the book are neither objective nor carefully checked out.Sadly disappointed as a source book; very entertaining fiction."
2,two months down and broken,"We've had this machine two months....yesterday, it stopped showing a picture, but still plays sound. I suppose we can use it for a stereo.Also....the remote control is pretty unresponsive. Seems to take a long time to get the message. All in all...a pretty crappy machine.Luckily, still under warranty."
2,NO DVD-R,"I bought this dvd player because I just got a dvd burner and I needed a dvd player that played dvd-r disks. Well this one was advertised to do that; it even says it on the box. When i pull it out of the box and plug it up, I put a dvd-r in to watch it, and it gives me a ""no-disk"" error. I'm sending this back and getting my money."
1,Warning- won't run on iBook G3,"Don't buy this game if you expect to install it and run it on a G3 iBook. It freezes up on the first frame and goes no further. An unhappy Christmas gift experience to be avoided. Although it says ""designed for OS X"", I don't think anyone at the company has actually tried it on a new computer. My son's 4 month old iBook exceeds all the requirements, but it sure doesn't work."
1,Problems with HMDH40000U,"I purchased two separate units, neither would work out of the box. Received the same error message: 201 calibrating, please wait. I waited hours, reset, ect. Could never get them to work, called JVC, they were of no help. I have used the earlier model 30000 for years with no problems. Purchased the HMDH5U after giving up on the 400000. The HDMI out does not work on the HMDH5U and now play back without problems is sporadic. Every 10 minutes it shuts off comes back on after 20 seconds."
2,Not a good VHS VCR at all,"I have to disagree with some other reviews I've read. I've owned this VCR for about a year now and very rarely, if ever, use it. First, there's the almost impossible task of getting HD content into the thing. Second, as a regular old everyday-use VCR, it sucks. It's very slow to start playing a tape, it's tracking is terrible, and it doesn't even show a picture when you fast forward. My $99 Mitsubishi VCR is far superior for everyday VCR use. Although with TiVo and Netflix, I really don't use VCRs much anymore! I miss the awsome VCRs they made in the early '90s...with frame advance, jog shuttles, etc. I thought this would be the best VCR they make these days, and if it is, I think it's safe to say the days of the VCR are drawing to a close."
1,VERY DISPLEASED,"If your set top box doesn't have a firewire output, forget about recording HI DEF. There is no DVI or component video ""in"" to this VCR. I'm not even sure if firewire will carry the HI DEF signal...I can't get JVC to answer my e-mails. I paid $750.00 for a VCR that isn't any better that my $200.00 Sony."
2,Very boring and complicated.,Does not make law easier. Material presented in a very dull manner. no answers for examples. avoid book or instructer that uses it.
2,Good but another version was needed,"This book is an excellent book. But, a newer version has come out and I need the newer version. I did not know that before I bought this book. Therefore, I am returning it because I do not need it."
4,Cool,"Not bad. I've tried some different fans because my system was running too hot. When I got it, I looked it over real good. Pretty interesting design and it seems to be working nicely. The fan speed is variable so of course the higher you adjust it, the louder it gets. But hey, who cares if it works. For what it does, I don't think it is too loud.I would say the only drawback is the wiring. Seems like it could be a little heavier guage.It was close between a 4 and a 5. Easy to install."
1,it's annoying !,"It is probable good but it's loud and thats really annoying meand the quality of this product was not as I think,however, I will not recommended this to my friends."
3,Alot of hot air,"It blows air from both sides. It circulates air. The worse place to put it is facing a video card where the fan on the card is blowing against it. Kind of defeats the purpose of cooling the video card. It blows hot air back at the card not away from it. It doesn't pull cool air in from outside the case just circulates it eliminating hot spots. If you install it below a video card and increase the fan speed the video card will be fighting with it to stay cool and your video will slow down or freeze. On a good note it does keep dust from building up inside your computer. I modified mine so it pushes air sideways, i like it because it looks fancy and it keeps the dust buildup down."
3,Computer case fan,"This case fan, which is attached like an expansion card and even has plastic inserts to fit snugly into a PCI slot, does move air effectively. On the plus side, it is variable speed, and if you like the LED lighting enhancement, so much the better. I was hoping for a little less noise - even at the lowest speed, it was a bit more noise than I wanted. I do have an exceptionally quiet system though - big Zalman cooler for the CPU, fanless video card, etc."
3,eh,"works desent to cool your graphics card a little with a variable speed sw on it , but dosnt reall move air out of the case! 3 of 5 stars ALOHA LOPAKA"
4,PLEASE READ!,"Ok, i got this in the mail in 3 days, fast shipping.Its easy, put it in a pci slot and it goes it uses a molex pin for power.I got this because my new graphics card was hitting 80C sometimes ( which i didnt like ) at like 90% fan speed.This WITH this fan both at max speed did nothing. Why? Instead of cooling it down, it was just blowing hot air at the gpu doing nothing.Although I was able to get something great out of this fan! I wasn't going to just let it be wasted, so i used some normal duck tape ( yes, lol ) and taped it to me case. This is perfect because its dual fans, its sitting about half over my gpu and half over my mobo/cpu.Now im getting around a 10C drop at idle and 8C drop at full load. Not only on my gpu but my whole computer.;)"
4,Decent cooliong for the $,"I have an Antec eleven hundred case with 5 fans, a GTX 570, and the Vantec pci card cooler The pci cooler cools my GTX 570 4-5 degrees at full speed while my GFX card is at 99% load through FurMark. All in all 5 degrees cooler for a few bucks.Note: it makes a considerable amount of noise at full speed. Only 4 stars due to the noise."
5,it helps,"Placed it under my gtx 560ti. Not only with my video card but overall my system being cooler by 10 degrees. For those of you who love silence you will hear this one, even with the speed turned all the way down. I'm happy with the product anyways. It helps keep the temps down."
2,Doesn't really do what it should.,"Got this hoping that it would keep my GPU cooler, but it actually made it about 7C hotter idle and didn't do much on load. Tried placing it above and below it, but it didn't make a difference. Kinda loud when its on high but I guess the LED's are cool."
5,Does the job!,"Works as advertised. Installed right under my 7850 card and keeps things running cool. Variable speed control is nice, even though I keep it on low."
4,Nice for cooling gpu,i got a gtx 550ti and this additional boost of cooling allows my gpu to run at optimal levels and dissipate the heat. Its nice and it lights up lovely to ensure that your case looks great while running koool
3,"It's cool, and helps some.","I mainly got this for cosmetic purposes, even so this is a fan so I feel obligated to write a review accordingly. In my Azza Genesis 9000w rig with a R-ATX airflow and a Sapphire Radeon 7870 2gb GPU, I have only slight changed in gpu temps, having said that, Sapphire is a great company and I feel that it's already at an optimum temp rating for the time being. (other than watercooling) but I give this 4 stars because of the cosmetic appearance I love. The functionality is good, this does has a fan control that is analog, and can go very fast, can be loud though, which is why i give 4 stars."
4,It might work for you ... it might not. It didn't for me.,"I had a weird experience with this fan. It powers up and runs, but ... when I plug it into either PCI slot I have available, my system won't boot. I am running a PCIe video card and have the onboard video disabled. I assume my issue has something to do with my motherboard rather than the with the fan itself (such as trying to determine what the heck is in the PCI slot and refusing to continue the boot process).Hopefully you won't have the trouble I did."
4,Great Product - few pros and cons,"I bought this product for a gaming rig project I started, nothing to fancy but I did put alot of time into designing my ventilation system, I added this in so its directly under my GFX card, (nvidia 9500GT) and I saw a difference of about 2 degrees with medium speed... (high speed increases temp...?) But the only con is that the bracket used to attach the product sucks, it barely holds up the fans so I had to use my own bigger screws and drill out a bigger hole (easy to do)but all in all, product looks and works great and adds a nice blue LED lighting to mix with my other red/blue LED fans.4/5 Stars - ****"
3,"Nice Fan, Not sure of it's Amplitudes yet","I just wanted to Mod my case with a Plexiglass side casing, and have a little extra show lights, other than that, I haven't really compared the internal temps VS when it was out of the tower. I believe it to be a little bit quieter than what it used to be however, if you give it plenty of space to breathe, causes less dust in the system as well, as if you were to add any fan to a system."
3,it's okay,"i haven't used it yet as it does not work the way it decribed. but it makes a goooood dust blocker, i guess."
2,The item does not perform as expected,I bought the video card fan to cool down my hot video card.It is easy to install. It does not cool down the video card at all even I put the setting to max.The fans are noisy and material is light and cheap looking.I run out of ideas now. Maybe I have to change a video card.
2,"Strong, adjustable, but not effective","This is a fancy item, pretty strong air flow created by it. However, it only accelerate the air circulation inside your desktop box, not helpful for heat exchange to the outside. It also creates high frequency noise..."
1,Ruined my computer,"There was a loose piece of metal on the 4-pin molex connector, which landed on my harddrive and fried my computer."
5,VANTEC,"This fan puts out some good air flow..Its a little loud on high, so i keep it set a little past low. but over all im satisfied. it has a nice blue glow that goes great with other lights inside my case. thanks Jesse"
4,Does its job,"great for keeping a video card cool, there is noticable amount of noise when turned to max speed, fan speed is very easily adjustable without opening computer case. if you bought a video card without a pre-build in fan this is very easy solution to heat problems."
2,Pretty loud for the amount of air it moves.,"After buying this, it did not actually cool my GPU down much (1 degree Celcius at the most), partly my fault because I have a reference ATI card, and the heatsink partially blocks it. It moves a good amount of air if you put it on high, but the sound is so loud that I can hear it from a different room, and is by far the loudest thing in my whole computer, it is louder than all my fans combined (5 120mm, 1 140mm, 1 200mm). Even on the lowest setting, it is audible over the sound of all the fans. If you have a reference GPU card, this probably will not help you cool down your GPU. Also, it may interfere with the airflow inside your case.Pros:Fan speed controlBall bearing fansBlue LEDs (depending on what you like)worked out of the boxCons:It's actually pretty loud, even at the lowest setting; VERY loud at the highest.Power cord somewhat shortBlue LEDs (depending on what you like)"
2,Not for my setup,Increase my GTX 550ti temperature to 46*C with this fan install; it run about 33*C without the extra fan. Don't know why.
1,Save you money,"after just a few months ,even with new batters, the beard trimmer runs weak. It is on it way out !The metal part gets very hot after a few minutes of use."
5,It's Great!,Love this thing for trimming my mustache and beard. I've wasted dollars on other products that do nearly the job this one does. Highly recommend it. Great value.
1,Impossible to put together,"Impossible to figure out how to interchange the 13 parts that come with this item. And don't look to the so-called instruction manual, it's absolutely useless. NOT worth the aggravation!!!!"
4,love this author,"I like a book that is more then one dementional, even if it is a romance novel. Even with the parts regarding the airlines, this was a great read."
2,Boring,This was not an interesting book. I read three books a week & could not finish Blue Skies. It was not a great story.
2,overly long drawn out book,I have read many of Robin's books and was not impressed. It was way too long on airline information and short on story.
3,not as good,"This book is not nearly as good as her ""Virgin River"" series. I found it a little slow and too much detail."
5,Blue Skies,Blue Skies is an excellent read. It grabs your interest on the first page and proceeds to keep you turning the pages from than on. It is hard to put down and do what you should be doing instead of reading a book. I loved it.
2,Not one of her best,I love her books but this one was very detail oriented concerning the start up of an airline. I thought there was to much detail it had a hard time holding my interest..
4,Blue Skies,I read it twice. All the Airlane descriptions were a bit boring but the action of the plot kept you reading. The characters were great and well rouded.
5,"Blue Skies sometimes are scary since 911,Book found at Amazon","Blue Skies by Robyn Carr and preordered from Amazon, popped into my Kindle last Tuesday. I love Robyn Carr's book and this was no exception. It is a very interesting book about the airline industry with romance, single parents, sexy flight attendants, and surly Human Resource people, along with suspense to keep it interesting. I wondered how she investigated and researched so much material, but in epilogue she explained and the fact that her husband is a pilot also helped."
3,I liked it,"I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars. I didnt' think it was quite up to the standards of the Virgin River series, but still a good read. I personally enjoyed reading all the details about the airline industry. It made me think she had done her research on the topic. Plus, the story is about her job and her role in the company. Romance is there, but sex is not the main part of the story. It is about a strong woman raising her children and dealing with life's surprises. It also involves the true meaning of friendship, trust and family."
4,Robyn Carr Fan,"I stumbled on the first Virgin River novel at a book swap and was hooked immediately. It is a dream world but her characters are soEasy to like that I found it hard to put down and have gone on to read the entire series. I read the review on Blue Skies where the reader did not enjoy all the technical aspects of the airline business but decided to try it anyway. I am so glad I did as I found that information only added depth to the story. If you like Robyn Carr I think you will enjoy this book and I hope it is the start of a whole new series. I read it on my kindle and really like the notifications I get when one of my favourite authors, Robyn Carr being one, has a new book out."
4,Moving forward,"I always like reading books by Robyn Carr and this did not disappoint me. It was uplifting,well-written, and made perfect reading at the lake. The characters showed resilience, optimism and wanted to move forward, never give up to make better decisions: all things I expect from myself."
1,Disappointing & Boring,"I love Robyn Carr stories, but unfortunately not this one. I bought for my Kindle and read 28% of the book before I gave up because character development was so lacking. Too many details about the airline business...uninteresting details. I think I will now go read a Jodi Thomas book to recover from the boredom."
5,Covers MedSlant pillow perfectly,"We bought an extra pillow so you can always have a pillowcase handy for the MedSlant pillow, even if one is in the wash. It is an odd size, so I highly recommend the pillowcase. Only covers on top like a fitted sheet, but does the job better than any other sheet or pillowcase, in my opinion."
5,Great.,This is very necessary for my wedge pillow. I am very happy to have yet another cookbook of hers. Thanks so much.
5,Perfect for Me,"Since the first night, this pillow has allowed me to sleep more comfortably and with considerably less pain from acid reflux/heartburn and snoring. My wife now swears by this pillow as she can sleep soundly next to me. Highly recommend!"
4,Does the job,"The MedSlant pillow cover is lightweight and easy to put on. I was surprised to find that it was not a complete pillow cover, but only for the top of the pillow, which attached with corners that hug the pillow like a fitted sheet. I suppose that making a cover for a triangle shaped pillow with a zipper would be very difficult, so for the product and price I would say it is what it should be. Of course, it only came in white, and I would have loved to get it in lavander or blue!"
1,Does not work and a rude company,"I have been using my pillow for a few days now to help with my acid reflux. When I sleep with the pillow I wake up with back and neck aches. If you move at all when you sleep, I do not suggest this product. When I called medslant they were rude and inconsiderate. When I told them the issues I was having the person curtly said ""whatever. Good bye."" and hung up on me. You cannot return after purchase and so they are done with you. I hope this helps someone. I don't want someone else to make the same mistake I did."
2,problem,The pillow hurts my neck really bad and I cannot use it. I wish I could return it. i do not know if it helps against acid reflux because it is impossible to sleep on.
3,extra cover for pillow,got this because didnt no medslant pillow came with cover but when i wash one can use the other one works good
4,Med Slant Pillow,I think the pillow works great and I like the way it folds up for carrying (although I thought it would actually roll up instead of fold).
3,"Try ""Science Enrichment"" for grades 5-6 instead- Better for older kids","The cover says The Giant Science Resource Book is for grades 1-6, but the activities are far too simple for most 5th and 6th graders. If you need reproducibles for older elementary children, The 100+ Series Science Enrichment, grades 5-6, is a book of 100 reproducibles that is a much better match for this age; it is challenging and covers an array of science topics that are pertinent to this age level. The book is published by Instructional Fair and can be found on Amazon. ISBN 0-88012-915-8"
4,Good Product.,I like this better than a regular gel for curly hair. I don't blow dry but it helps with frizz for curls.
3,Not what I expected,I like products that control frizz but leaves my hair feeling natural. This leaves my hair feeling stiff and unnatural.It does control the frizz though.
4,Nice compact dual wattage travel hair dryer,A little bit smaller than my Sharper Image one that has served me well for many years but just died recently.Hopefully if it lasts as long (more than 5 years) that I would be real please. Has very similar features as my old one.Like: End cap just unscrew for removing lint and dust. Cool blast. Cord slightly shorter (almost 5 feet) which is even better for traveling and packing.Dislike: No hair dryer hanger loop like my old one.Reserve one less star for long term durability test.
4,Just what I wanted except......,"It was powerful as advertised and according to reviewers. I realize the faster the fan, the more it dilutes the heat from the heating coils, but it could be a little warmer. I'd still recommend it though."
5,Great little dryer,"I had this blow dryer for many years and when it finally died I didn't even consider getting a different model. I like this dryer because it's extremely lightweight and yet has as much power as a full-size dryer. Much easier to use! The ""cool"" button is great for protecting hair from excessive heat damage. I wish it came with some add-on attachments but otherwise it's perfect. Great for travel and everyday use."
1,Great! While it lasts...,"The raving reviews about this hair dryer are all correct: it dries hair faster! its sound isn't as obnoxious as others! it's small! compact! cute! However, it only lasted about 10 months. We used it almost every day, or at least every other day, to dry my 3-year-old's hair. Typically we used the low setting, and occasionally the high setting. The ""cool air"" button was great, too, but we rarely used it. It died suddenly, with no warning sign, after about 9-10 months. DISAPPOINTED!"
5,styler,"It works as I desired, without blowing my hair with a blast. It is a gentle air for fine hair."
4,"Already had one, needed another one!","My wife already has this dryer, but she wanted another one to gift someone. The good thing I like about it is the dual voltage switch, compact, very simple to use. Also it has the Cool switch that blows cold air that my wife likes as well. Overall simple to use and works good. The only con I can think of is the chord gets in the way a lot.By the way, the old one we had is still good, except there is some rust on the rim now so try to keep it away from any moisture...."
4,loud but dries fast,"Bought this dual voltage drier for my trip to Europe. Dried my hair quickly, was compact for travel, used low setting only based on prior reviews. Great dryer but LOUD!"
3,"Powerful for its size, but needs a diffuser","I bought this dryer for a trip to London, and had no problems with the voltage whatsoever. Note that even though the dryer converts the voltage, the plug prongs themselves are still made for US outlets - you will need to get a socket adapter.The size and portability of this dryer are great. It's also still quite powerful for how small it is. However, it really needs to come with a diffuser...my hair doesn't come out nearly as smooth as it does with a longer barrel drier + diffuser. But I've learned over the years that the cost of a great international vacation is bad hair...So, long story short, this dryer is great for what it is :)"
4,Nice little dryer,Just what I needed. Didn't blow the fuse in my Greek apartment like my classmates' dryers. Could use an attachment to focus the heat.
5,Best travel dryer ever,I just returned from a trip to Israel and this travel dryer performed beautifully. All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly. I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel. I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack. Highly recommend!!!!
2,Don't be cheap. It's true you get what you pay for.,"Don't be cheap dish out the extra $5 and get something that is going to get the job done right.This is very cheap looking, but it is cheap so how can i complain. I don't even know if I can call the material it is made out of plastic.It doesn't heat up past luke warm. I like my curling iron to get so hot I can't touch it, this one is so warm I can just leave my finger on it without getting burned.I'm pretty sure if I got any hotter than it already does the material it is made of would melt.The barrel itself is very short. It's like a travel/mini iron.At it's best this is just a brush with a cord on it.I gave it two stars because ""you get what you pay for""Maybe this is why I am the only one to give this product a review everybody else knew better."
4,Hot Brush,"I like the Hot Brush, I have short hair which I blow dry and use the Brush to finish the top.It is quick, compact and lets me finish quickly."
5,Great curling iron !,Doesn't tangle in your hair. great for fine hair. makes frizzies into soft curls. Soft tips keep it from hurting your scalp. I've used this type for many years & wouldn't use any other kind. I use them until the bristles break off from daily use. please keep making them !
3,Not what I expected,I wanted a decent curling iron. This one is for small tight curls. Not recommended for soft curls or waves.
1,Waste of money...,"I was so miscarried by the earlier reviews on this product , but I must say it is just a waste of money.The brush does not get got enough , does not make any difference in my hair. No help with setting your hair style."
2,Not very durable,"I bought this curling iron because it looked like a decent size to use when traveling. That part is true. The problem is that the teeth on the iron continually break off. If it came with replacement teeth it would be much better. Cheap plastic, not durable."
5,Excellent Product!,I am very pleased with this product. The size is ideal for travel...fits perfectly in a small carry-on bag. Also fits in my tote bag for work for quick touch-ups. Heats up quickly and is ideal for my needs. Recommend highly!
3,Not what I thought it was going to be,I thought it would be a blow dryer along with the hot air like my old one which I loved but it finally gave out. It is my fault I guess for not properly understanding the description of the product.
2,Very poor design,I was very disappointed with this curling iron the brush part is only 3 inches long which is not long enough to curl a section of hair. Conair need to shorten the handle and lengthen the brush part and they would have a much better product. I have normally gotten a very good product from conair but this one is not one of them. I do not recommend purchasing this curling brush.
5,I love this curling brush,This curling brush is great. It has nice long teeth so I can grab the hair easily as my hair is on the short side. I hope they don't stop making it. I would be very upset.
2,Not so good,"Was finding it difficult to find the brush style curling items in the local stores. I didn't want to spend too much money, but I've purchased $10 curling irons before that have lasted me years. Anyways .. the first disappointment is there is no ""on/off"" switch!! I was a little confused about that. I would think that CONAIR would realize that's a HUGE safety issue. The second disappointment is that it takes FOREVER to heat up (at least to the point where I'm satisfied). Other than that, it's a curling iron."
3,Conair BC40LBC 3/4-Inch Hot Brush,"A little disappointing. I realized later I could have gotten a better deal ($$ wise) at the local drug store. And, there isn't an off/on switch, which surprised me."
5,This is one exceptional talent!!!!,"There is no question that Fnkysax will take its' place at the top of my CD favorites. Q.G.W. really has taken the elements of Jazz, R&B, and Funk to create the most intriguing and original style that I have heard in years. His eloquence and superior musicianship on this CD will melt the heart of any listener."
4,"Bagels, Bacon and Butter, Y'all....","As a Mississippian, I found this pictography truly amazing! I work for a US Government agency, and I will be living in Israel for the next two years. Although I am not Jewish, I think the best way to learn about another culture is to incorporate what you know. What? Southern Jews eat bacon, and GASP, HAM? Southerners know all about the BLT and Easter Hams. Not too many of us know about Judaism or that Temples even exist(ed) in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana or even Arkansas. The photos and text of this book reveal a beautiful heritage that I am afraid is --- or soon will be --- extinct from the states that border the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River. Florida NOT included!If you have any interest in Southern Culture(s), add Shalom Y'all to your shopping cart today!PS: Please note the spelling of ""y'all."" It is a contraction for You All, thus, the apostrophe replaces the OU. Correct your friends who probably spell it: ""ya'll."""
4,Good CD even though it is old,I bought this CD after checking it out from the library. I am glad I did. It is an oldy but goody. I enjoy listening to it a lot.
3,"Elizabeth, the hypocrite","I really liked the book. I'm glad there was closure for Jessica and Nick, though I thought he should have remained a main character. I want to talk about Elizabeth. Everyone else is talking about Jess & Nick, but I want something said about Elizabeth's behavior. Tom was right. She is a hypocrite. How dare she open her big mouth to Todd about Dana? It's really none of her business!! And then, she does even worse by making out with her sister's ex-husband, and CONTEMPLATING sleeping with him!! Like everyone keeps suggesting, she needs to get over herself. I hope she is alone for a long time. I like Dana and Todd. I hope Tom finally moves on with Chloe, and I hope Danny either talks to Izzy or find someone new."
2,Mas or menos,"Mas or menos. More or less. Production quality is fine. The instruction consists of learning steps - not the best way to learn to tango. Instructor does not speak English, which means that something is likely lost in translation."
2,Too old-fashioned,"This is the way tango was maybe 10 to 20 years ago. But we are in the 21st century now. People don't want to look like this, dress like this, or dance like this anymore. Time to move on with the new generation of tango dancers and teachers. Time for nuevo tango."
1,Cheap and you get what you pay for,"I ordered this filter figuring it cannot be too bad. Obviously, I was wrong. The filter media itslef was OK, but the molding around it was flimsy and porous, mis-shaped and the filter media was not connected well on one side, resulting in a hole almost 1 mm in size, which would definitly let the dust in. Very poor quality overall."
4,nice work on vintage Mercedes,"The ""Original"" series of books tend to be well-illustrated and replete with the kind of minute detail that lovers of the given vehicles described enjoy poring over. This volume by Tim Slade is on a par with the rest, with the exception of a few typos. If you love these cars, or own one, or just aspire to, it is quite a good literary drive. There are a few typos, and this particular volume does not have the option and color charts that the similar volume on 113 Mercedes does have, but overall it is well done. As a driver, I am familiar with all of the mentioned vehicles and I think Mr. Slade has done justice to a group of automobiles well worth writing about."
3,This book is now out of print,I'm the author of this book and wanted to note that it is nowout of print.
2,Could be much better,"I was very excited for this. In my childhood I used several whistles, having a super loud whistle could only be good for my family safety out in the mountains.I was wary because of the reviews stating that is not really that loud unless you really puff like a big bad wolf, well they are true, and worst than I thought.My 6 year old has issues blowing for a three seconds rescue signal.If I puff without really putting myself in it, is no louder than some cheap plastic party whistles out there.My 5 year old, constantly closes the chamber exits, so no sound for him if he is not really paying attention.In the end, not good as a security device."
3,Great Whistle,"Wish I would have bought the whistles that included the lanyard, but I am very pleased with my purchase and the quality of the product."
1,Classic PINK Fox 40-Whistle should be pink,I received a blue whistle when I ordered a pink one. The whistle part worked fine but the wrong color is a wrong color.
1,Not a real Settler game,"I have had all other versions and they have been much more fun to play> this version does not have free maps and the preset maps are not as good as the old ones, also not enough variety.It was disappointing and I just bought the new Settler Rise of an Empire and I hope it get's better again!"
4,settlers.. decent game but quirky,"After wanting this game for ages, I finally found it used at a good price through amazon.com and bought it after playing the demo. The game itself is a very cool RTS, with nice graphics and lots of little goodies. The strategy plays a large role, especially considering changing seasons, where rivers freeze in the winter, allowing access to previously untouchable parts of nice sized maps. The heroes are great, each with different abilities and the military system is good, this is a great game for defensive turtles. Unfortunately, the process of building up a large colony and military is monotonous, the same steps and research are required map after map and the upgrades come slowly. This alone is the reason my copy has sat untouched for a couple of weeks, but I'm sure many people would love an RTS where rushing in the beginning isnt such a big issue, and economy is."
2,A terrible butchery of the Settlers francise.,"Whoever is responsible for butchering the Settlers series into this title should be fired. I suspect UBI is to blame for wanting to make the game more ""Mainstream"". In the process, they destroyed everything that Settlers was supposed to be about and what we are left with is a pretty lousy game.Its truely sad what has happened to this series, this title is best avoided."
1,Disappointment,Repeated delay in ship date compelled me to cancel before shipmemt. Still waiting for refund
3,Made in USA -- but Mint is TOO Strong,I wish they made these toothpicks unflavored. I contacted the company and they do not. The mint is too hot and burns my lips. Three stars.
3,Mediocre Kaiju,"I bought this after reading some really good reviews. Unfortunately, Yokai Monsters disappoints. It does have it's moments of charm and a few decent monsters. Most of them are not all that great, though and do not get enough screen time or closeups. There are MUCH better Japanese monsters out there. Track down all the Godzilla, Gamera, Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Japanese Spiderman (1978), and Kure Kure Takora before you pick this up."
2,"Steps ok, They suck as teachers","I think the steps are pretty cool, but they are absoutley horrible at teaching. I think they suck. How can someone make a video and not stop to show the steps step by step. I Would NOT recomend this to anyone new or experienced. There are way better instructional videos out on the market. DO NOT WASTE your money. TRY ""Dvida"" Instructional videos"
1,Incomplete,"This book is nicely done, and has excellent photographs of Beanie Babies. The book is for Winter of 1999. It lacks many of the current Beanie Babies that are on sale now and is outdated. If you need to be kept current this is not the book to use. The current monthly magazines are the best buy for your money."
1,Wrong year.,"The cover says Winter 1999 Edition, but the book is 1998 information. It has 40 beanie babies that were listed in the Summer 1999 edition missing, and it only lists the first 9 Beanie Buddies instead of 28. I feel I really got cheated."
1,Its the worst beanie handbook that you can buy!,The values are totally off.(they are too high of estiments)The value of all currents are unlisted. The book just stinks!If you want a value guide dont get this one. I recommend the Les and Sue Fox Handbook.
2,pablum,"This book is a good example of why many readers cannot take ""Christian fiction"" seriously. I am a Christian, and I love to read. However, most of the ""Christian"" fiction I have read is pretty awful and very disappointing. This is no exception. Unimpressive, bland writing, and a love story involving a 42-year-old starving artist and a young woman who is evidently about 20 years younger? Yawn! Also, I did not realize the army had ever allowed 42-year-old men to enlist. Whatever. I should have know better and steered clear of this book. Definitely NOT recommended!"
1,Extremely disappointing...a wasted day...,"I can hardly believe this book has been published. I love Christian historical fiction, but this book bites the dust. It contains very little mention of Christ or Christianity, and the plot line is very dull. I have no idea what Tim LaHaye was thinking when he co-wrote this book. The characters do not emit any chemistry, and if the ""cliff-hanger"" ending was written to draw the reader to the second one in the series, the plan failed terribly."
2,programmable nano uv wand,"Zadro Nano Programmable UV Light Wand - NANO05NANO05I purchased this UV Wand,I received the wand with no instruction, no rechargable product to recharge the batteries,I inserted 3 c type 1.5 v batteries and cannot get the wand to operate, the wand appears to be a non-workable wand,I am requesting a new wand, or a refund of my money for the purchase, I really would like a new workable wand, I will return the non-workable wand upon reciept of a new Nono UV wand,as per your shipping records,My mailing address13530 Sea Breeze CircleAnchorage, Ak. 99516"
1,broke & company will not replace it,"This Nano UV was given to me for a gift, it worked fine for about 30 days & then stopped working & they will not stand behind their product. When we contacted the company to ask them to repair or replace it they sent us an e-mail stating the following:NANO: The UV light for the Nano Scanner has a useful life of 4000 scans. It cannot be replaced.WARRANTY INSTRUCTIONS:You can send in your mirror to be repaired or replaced if it is still with in the 90-day limited warranty. The customer must prepay postage. Please follow the instructions below.Thank you, Customer ServiceIn other words your out of luck! You bought it now you own it. Its not like this is a toy for $10.00. This was expensive & the company will not stand behind it if it stops working right away.Good luck if you choose to buy it but I would save the $80.00 & don't buy it unless they change their warranty.Sincerely,Howard"
1,Didn't Work!,"I was very disappointed in this product. The light did not work. I tried replacing the batteries, but still no luck. The item seems cheaply made. I will be returning it."
1,Anne Marie,"I would prefer to rate this item a minus 5 but that is not an option. I saw some negative reviews posted prior to my purchasing one but thought perhaps the problems were isolated. So I forked over the high price for a simple ultraviolet light. I scanned 3 times with it and it is now not working. I changed the batteries and that did not help. I would really recommend that you think before purchasing this. If you really want one, purchase it from Neiman Marcus as returning it when it stops functioning will not be a problem. BEWARE."
5,Perfect...even with those lines.,"DeityLord below me has noted the lines and he's right, but there's an explanation in the manual which says these lines are normal for an aperture grill monitor. Matter of fact, I never noticed these (and I had to look hard) until I read his rating and that's because they're only ""highly"" visible when you're working on a white screen. Therefore, if your primary need is word processing, they could be annoying.Being as most of my use is internet and photo work, they're hardly there and from the moment I plugged it in, the 950 was perfect. It's a beautiful image, great colors, and I didn't have to do a single bit of tweaking as the factory settings were just the way I like them.The price is certainly right here, and at just over three hundred bucks (shop around!) this will do me just fine until the next upgrade or a better and newer technology becomes affordable."
2,Not very impressed,I purchased this one a while ago but I barely use it as I have curly hair and so doesn't really work well with my hair. Maybe with a fine hair could work!
4,Good for Starters,"This book was used in my Intermediate 3d Animation course and it's pretty good for the basics of rigging a bipedal character. However, the book tends to be inconsistent with some of its naming conventions for certain bones while rigging, which could confuse a beginner. For example, when they go through and tell you to name all your bones, they tell you to name the ""knee"" joint ""up leg"", then a few chapters later, they refer to it as the ""knee joint"" instead of ""up leg."""
2,needs more depth,after using this book for a while I find it needs to go into more detail on how tools work and common errors. For example the birail and curve editing tool are give about 4 sentencs but are used alot.good examples of work flow but don't feel like I'm mastering the program like an intermediate tutorial should give.
4,"good filtration, lose the install kit","The kit does not hook up to braided water lines, so I had to go to Home Cheapo and pick up some parts. After that installation was a snap, water tastes good with the included filter, and no leaks."
2,Under sink filtration system,This product is difficult to keep anchored to the wall when changing the filters. I have ripped the assembly out of the wall every time. I have tried up to 200lb. wall anchors and either removing or installing the filter has not worked properly. The included D-20A filter works great with no pressure change and water comes out better tasting and clearer than before. I did upgrade to the D-30A filter and water pressure dropped significantly. Installation is simple and easy the main downfall to this product is the pressure drop and unit being ripped from wall.
2,Leaks,"Anything with compression fittings sucks. I spent 2 days fixing leaks from compression fittings, after all the leaks were fixed the filter works OK. Cannot notice a big taste difference, when I replace the filter I will try a D-30 maybe that will make a difference. Just out of the box I would not recommend this filer."
3,Good Quality + Fast Delivery,the book i got from this company is great. it's almost in 'brand-new' condition and it is just what i needed for my class.
1,Displeased,Bought this for a blinker system for my ATV/ORV. A little frustrated that there is no schematic! Guess I'll tinker with it untill the magic smoke comes out of it.
1,No estoy conforme,No se si fue por mal almacenamiento del suplidor o que fue lo que paso. Pero no me funciono.
5,Beautiful Watch!!,I received this item for Christmas today. This is by far the prettiest collegiate women's watch I have ever seen. Very well made and quality is excellent for the price. I would definately buy this again!
1,Do not buy this book!!,"It is extremely deceptive to even call this an Office XP reference. It contains no reference whatsoever to any of the new features of Office XP (Smart Tags, Task Panes, etc., etc.) It is, at best, a very basic introduction to the most common features of previous versions of the Office suite. I returned my copy."
4,good book for everyone,It is really a good book for anyone who wants to learn abt Office XP. usually we know a very few basic features about the Office applications. But there are much more than that. This book tells indetail about most of them with examples and screenshots. It comes with a CD with lot of new tempelates and examples. Good choice for its cheap price.
3,This one was just okay for me,"The purpose and scope of the book is obvious from the title. It is intended both for professionals and for bereaved parents. For me, it was just a little too dry and clinical. I prefer to read the books that are written by grieving parents, to heal themselves and leave hope for those who come behind. I donated mine to my Compassionate Friends chapter in the hope that it might help someone else."
3,"A fun read for some, wearing for others","I read this book, and enjoyed it. However, I could see where other people might not.One of the problems with this was the feeling that, having read some history of the Civil War, I already knew where the plot line was going. Additionally, although I relish wordplay (and such substitutions as ""Ramblerton"" for ""Nashville"" nearly had me rolling on the floor once I puzzled them out), for others it may seem too much like work.I have loved much of Turtledove's work. However, if this book is likely to be part of another series, I have some concerns for readers who are new to him. Series of his, such as the ""Great War"" series, are difficult to appreciate unless one has read ALL of the preceding books in the series.In any case, I liked this book, and had a lot of fun puzzling out the names and the places."
2,Not a Civil War buff? Then pass,"Even a non-history buff could easily pick up that this was a Civil War re-written with magic tale. But when I finished it, I couldn't figure out why I'd read it. None of the generals were particularly compelling, it was clear from the word go what was going to happen, many passages were way-overwritten. Turtledove was highly recommended to me, but I'm awfully glad I picked this up at the library and didn't buy it!"
2,"A book too far, for a writer who's wasting his talent","Turtledove is a tremendous writer, but he just writes too many books, and this one is proof. The magic in this book is just a plot device -- it does no real work except to occasionally have a spell misfire in some uninteresting way. Turtledove has done some very interesting work with magic (see, e.g., the Toxic Spell Dump) but he hasn't done it here. I love Turtledove's work, but this book offers little to the reader to justify its hardcover price. It's not actually bad, you understand, just not up to his usual standards. I'd put it into a class with ""Into the Darkness,"" which shares its flaws.Harry, you're a hell of a writer. If you're not making enough money to let you write fewer books and focus on the ones that are really first-class, get a better agent."
1,YAWN,"i very seldom do not finish a book. This one left me freezing cold. Same thing over and over and over. Tactics, one guy is a drunk, serfs and slaves, geoffrey and avram as idiots, so are their lead military guys. Major yadda yadda over and over. underlings think they are idiots. I've only quit mebbe 10 books max in my life. this one was painful due to boredom. bleah."
4,Good Book,"Its one of Michaels typical good books. You know, there are those typical good books that you expect out of a favorite author, and then there are those books that disappoint you, but that you read them anyway because you are just so used to the style of the author and are loyal to them. Well, this book had all the basic elements needed for a good Michaels or Peters' book. It had romance, suspense, humor, intrigue, and and insight into a particular type of world. In this case that was the world of politics. In many of her other books it is the world of Egyptology or archaelogy. She gives a lot of information about a certain type of lifestyle or industry and entertains by encompassing it with the romance and adventures of her funny characters. Again, typically good Micheals book."
1,Not worth the time...,"Ms. Michaels really missed the mark on this one! This book had real potential for being a good thriller, but too much time was spent on mundane events and it turned out to be a long, boring read. If someone has recommened Barbara Michaels to you, I would suggest ""Stiches in Time"", or ""The Dancing Floor"" - she really is a good writer. This book is not worth reading."
5,The Art is Obvious,"I loved this book. I was inspired by the ideas of the author and her guest artists. Wow! A beautiful book, great photography, fabulous ideas! Creativity and imagination and just plain American know-how. A must read book for miniaturists (is that a word?) Wish I could have given it ten stars. Yes I loved this book."
3,I am waiting,"I bought it one month ago, and now, I am waiting for the book yet.I hope dont wait more"
4,Comprehensive manual,"Much better than the Chilton manuals ... I've owned a couple of Chevettes and I've used both. The Haynes manual has much better procedure descriptions, and wiring diagrams that aren't even included in the Chiltion's books. If you plan to work on your Chevette you should get both books, but you won't go wrong relying on just the Haynes manual."
2,She talks too much,"I bought several videos at once and this was my least favorite. I had a pretty easy labor and I was eager to get back to my old self. I wanted a video that would maximize what little time I had during the day to work-out. I never use this video any more. I now use Postnatal Rescue on the really tired days and Postnatal Boot Camp for the maximum work-out.My biggest complaint is that the instructor seems to stop the work-out to tell you the benefits. Good info but not if I want to use the video again and again. It moved way too slow for me and I kept wishing she would move on. I got so bored I haven't even seen some of the sessions and just threw the DVD on a shelfI guess its a good video if you had a c-section and need to take things 'very easy', but it just wasn't for me"
2,Way... way way too slow.,"I became very impatient with this workout. It wasn't really pilates but was more like very slow yoga. She kept saying ""this move is borrowed from yoga"" so I'm not sure why she did not at least call it 'fusion' pilates. I was so bored I started doing my own workout while watching it, hoping it would pick up. It never did. Anyway, I'm not a fan of yoga so I was pretty disappointed. She also talked A LOT. On the upside... she has a lovely soothing British accent and the ladies who demonstrate are heart-warmingly British as well, and quite normal looking, crazy hair and all. So if you like lying on the ground and breathing for ages... this is for you."
2,Golf and Pilates,"I think this will be a great book, however it very difficult to use via Kindle. I am going to return the Kindle version and get the book version so I will be able to see the charts. This is not a good type of book for the Kindle. And - I love my Kindle, but the one downside of a Kindle is photos and charts."
3,not received,"I have not received this item yet, I am still waiting for this item to arrrive! It has been almost 6 weeks now."
1,Fried hair,"The first (and only) time I tried to use it, it melted the plastic tip and burned my hair, even though I didn't have it on the hottest setting. I had to rake through my hair to get the pieces that had been burned off."
1,Piece of crap!,"This is the worst curling iron I have ever used! I turned it up to its highest setting and it wasn't enough to create beautiful, or even decent, curls. I actually checked to make sure it was on!"
5,Refrigerator Filter,This product was shipped and delivered much quicker than I would have expected.The product was exactly as advertised.
3,"GREAT PRICE, FAST SERVICE",WE NEEDED A WATER FILTER REPLACEMENT FAST AND WE RECEIVED IT FASTER THAN WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED. THE PRICE FOR THIS BRAND NAME PRODUCT COULD NOT BE BEAT.
1,VERY DECEPTIVE!!!!! This is not a Frigidaire filter,"This is not a Frigidaire filter. I asked waterfilteronline and amazon to stop selling this item as a Frigidaire filter. Not only does the picture show a Frigidaire box but the description of the filter states Frigidaire. The filter I ordered did not come in a box nor did it have any certification stamp. These filters will fit in your refrigerator, if you are willing to risk your families health on an unknown manufacturer. In Waterfiltersonline's response, they claim that they have sold thousands of these without any problems. Waterfiltersonline did promptly refund my money but have not stopped selling off brand filters as the real deal and have not removed the picture of the filter that they do not ship."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"The advertising and picture are misleading. This is NOT an OEM Frigidaire WFCB as pictured. It is an after-market filter. No idea as to the quality, as there are no ratings on the package. The water quality is important to me - or why would I be buying a filter at all. Also, as another customer stated, the water initially comes out black. May just be carbon residue? - but I have never seen another filter do that.In fairness, the seller issued a full refund with no hassle, but the purchase was a complete waste of my time due to Amazon allowing this to be advertised in this manner.Even worse, after bringing this to an Amazon rep's attention several months ago, they have done NOTHING to change the seller's listing.Amazon - please GET WITH IT, listen to your customer feedback and either correct or REMOVE this item!!!"
1,bad merchandise,Did not read the reviews by others--my fault. I threw the filters away after trying both of the ones ordered. The water actually smelled bad! What are these things? They are not good whatever they are. Don't buy them!!
4,Good Deal!,"I ordered from Amazon and got a genuine Frigidaire(tm) filter at less than half what the Sears part center wanted to charge me. Hooked it up and it seems to work fine. Wish a new O ring and wrench would come with these things though, as the originals that came with my 1998 Kenmore fridge are the only ones I have."
4,Great Filter,"These filters came quick and really last a long time. We purchased them for a really good price too. Thanks,"
5,happy with this filter,I could not be happier with this filter for the cost and the exact one that I need for my refrigerator. This company delivers quickly and correctly every time.
2,The Tango Obsession,This is a Spanish speaking video and I was very disappointed in the sub titles. They were very amateurish and difficult to read. I'm sure the person speaking had some interesting comments but the sub titles did not convey this information. The pictorial story was good and the photography of the tango dancing was excellent but again the sub titles did not let you really know what was going on.
2,Very narrow view,"This video provides a very narrow view of the world of tango argentino. The creator chose to concentrate on his favorite dancer, while ignoring several much more influential and interesting tango professionals in Buenos Aires. There is a lot more to tango than what is shown here. A follow-up is a must."
5,Just to add...,"If the product rating is not enough. Yes, I add, this is a good product. Made my carpets look really nice. Removed a de-greaser stain that noting else tried could. Thinking about it, probably spent close to the price,on can cleaners."
1,POOR DESIGN,the idiot who approved this project need to step down.this is a very poor design. i have to constantly add water to the container because it does not hold a lot of water. i have a defective vacuum cleaner because it only vacuum for 10 seconds or less before the safety float engage.i spent over 2 hours to clean a 10 feet by 12 feet room. i just gave up and return it
1,Absolutely the worst piece of junk,"I am super disappointed with the Hoover. First use, the spin brushes broke and after awhile, the water stopped sucking, leaving the dirty water tank EMPTY and the carpet dry. After getting replacement brushes from Hoover, THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. Brushes broke while vacuuming. Do not buy this piece of junk. Wasted $100 and caused me many headaches. Furthermore, the vacuum is horrible at sucking and will stop using water after 1 use. Would NOT recommend!"
1,Missing Screws,"I don't know how well this Carpet Cleaner works as it arrived from Amazon without the screws needed to assemble it. I called Hoover and they said they would ship the screws by FedEx or UPS (I don't remember which) after their inventory was complete in 2 days. I waited. I waited. I waited and I waited. After about 7 or 8 days I called Hoover again. They had a record of my call but the screws had not shipped! As I had to return to Japan in a few days, I told them to keep their screws. I promptly put this back in the box and returned it to Amazon.com. I noticed this says ""SteamVac"" but it does not have an internal heater. Upon my return from Japan I bought a Bissell ProHeat that does have an internal heater. It also appears better constructed too but it's considerably more expensive."
3,steamLESScleaner,This machine has no heater. In order to make steam one needs very hot water. The box clearly says HEATED cleaning. This is misleading and I don't like to be mislead.
1,Poor Quality SteamVac,"We previously owned a Bissell Steam Vac, and after 2 years of very minimal use and several replacement parts we tossed it out. This replacement was supposed to be higher quality, and the first year was OK, but now it has trouble sucking up the detergent and we're about to toss this one too. Very disappointing."
2,Handle is piece of plastic garbage.,The handle with the triggers is so poorly designed. I called Hoover to order a replacement since the original one didn't work. The replacement was just as bad. The machine bottom with the brushes actually looks like it would work great if you can get past attaching the handle. I consider myself very talented when it comes to fixing and building things. I can say the the design of the handle and how the triggers work is horrible. Perhaps you'll have better luck.
4,good product - good service from Amazon,Based on the reviews I'd read I ordered this item and I was not disapointed. It came sooner than I expected and worked better than my expectations. This Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner does leave the carpets very dry and was easy to use. Got the stains out !
1,didn't work,"We tried it w/ the solution and dry, this vacuum just pushed the dirt and dust around - maybe ours was defective. we sent it back to amazon, all i can say is thank god we bought it from amazon where returns are hassle free!"
4,Great machine!,We have two dogs and I hate dirty carpets. This machine fills the bill. It cleans well and is easy to use.
5,Great Carpet Cleaner!,"The F5914 is very easy to operate. I read the instruction manual and went to work and the machine did just as it was supposed to do. Some reviews I read on the upholtery cleaner said it didn't perform well, but I could not find any problems with it. No problems with leaking or anything. I think if you read the instructions you will have no problems. Glad I bought this machine!"
4,More than expected,"I bought this on the recommendation of a co-worker, I was expecting something that would just lightly clean the carpet and that's about it.I had my carpets Professionally clean by DryChem and they did not do as good as a job as this Vacume cleaner, this Hoover leaves your carpets dryer than DryChem go figure.I am a dog owner and accidents do happen some times, but this Vacuume does an excellent job cleaning up,. Could not ask for more.The hand tools are sort of flimsybut is all you need is to clean carpets this is the tool you want."
1,Not as Advertised,"This item does not come with the advertised Steamvac Mega Carpet Care Kit. It is listed erroneously on Amazon, according to the seller. This seems like shady business practice to me, and I will not be buying anything else from this seller. You can get this much cheaper elsewhere. I'd suggest Googling it and finding someplace with a better price."
2,steamvac,"When I received the steamvac, it had been poorly packed and some plastic pieces had broken off. The broken pieces would not affect the actual use of the steamvac, so I did not want to go through the bother of sending it back. But I would think twice about ordering again."
1,Greatly Overrated,"I was so hopeful that this product would work as advertised. Unfortunatetly it is greatly overrated. It is little more than a vaccum cleaner. On carpet with a pattern, like sisel or wool carpet, the brushes do not reach the carpet material. Any slight stain remains untouched. Having had good products from Hoover in the past, I am very disappointed in this one.DON'T buy this product with the hope of cleaning your carpets!!"
1,"STEAM? Where? Cold water, occasionally tempid","I am so disappointed with this product. I am embarrassed to say how much I paid for it two years ago. I bought it based on its ratings here. Big Mistake!I recently attempted to use the hand attachments to clean my chairs. WHAT A MESS!! The hand attachment sprays all over the place. In order to get WARM water, you have to hold down the water spray button for several seconds, leaving your chair cushion saturated, and your floor wet!Hoover should be ashamed calling this a STEAM vac! Its down right misleading. What a waste of money."
1,if only I had known,"My husband was deployed when I ordered the steam vac. When he arrived, he assembled it for me and I tried to use it as our new dog had an accident. Water leaked everywhere, and 2 hours later it is not sill usable. I have bought Hoover products in the past, but this time I am so disappointed I think I'll give up on the brand. Very poor quality item, the worse 150 dollars I have ever spent!Another thing, if I had bought it locally, I could bring it back....what a costly mistake!"
5,Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner,I'll have to get back to you but I expect to love it. It is a replacement for one that was decades old before it gave out.
3,SteamVac,"It's too small and it is to difficult to change the dirty water container. It's okay. Not happy with it but oh, well. I still had to pay for a professional to come and clean the carpet."
3,glad i bought it,"Yes, i did heat up the water (not boiling hot) before putting it in the unit to start cleaning.You DO have to be careful with the unit putting it together since the plastic is very flimsy which is a shame since it does the job and was very effective for the room and stairs i used it on. My unit did not come with the piece to clean out the suction area so i just unscrewed the cover off of it and washed it down.Could this be better? absolutetly! but if you need one that will work this is the machine for you. I used it with the professional pet detergent. I did have leakage when i letthe unit stand upright while i used the stair hand held accessory but a small price to pay to get them clean. This still saves me money by not havingto call in the pros to clean and i don't need an appt. I just wish they would improve on it."
5,Buy it!!!!!!!!,"The best!!! I think because it is a simple design, no annoying fancy parts. It is a simple well made carpet cleaner!! I also think that the 12 amp motor is what really does the trick!There is nothing better than dumping that icky water pulled off carpet!! Makes you feel so good to get it off the floor. Let's see I started at 6-7pm and it is now 9 and the carpet is dry enough to sit on!!Whoo hoo!!"
4,i agree with the rest,Exceeds expectations. Easy to use and effective. Totally agree with the other good reviews. Much more user friendly than Bissel.
5,Very pleased!,I received the carpet cleaner in a timely manner and used it the first week-end. My carpet never looked better. Highly recommendthis product.
3,Just okay.,This carpet cleaner did not wow me. It is pretty hard to get the thing put together to even use. My husband even had a hard time. The directions for assembly are TERRIBLE. When we finally figured out where everything goes (only really by guessing)we tested a spot on the carpet. It looks pretty good and clean. I would spot treat before using this on some of the heavy stains.
3,Worked well once,I used this once and it did an okay job. As I was rolling it to my car it snapped open and now it will not stay locked into place. The machine is very heavy and cumbersome but does a decent job. If the warranty covers whatever happened to my machine I would recommend it.
5,Happy with Carpet shampooer from Amazon,"I ordered my Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge from Amazon.com. It was priced right and arrived promptly. I had no problem with the minimal assembly and put it to use immediately. It worked well for my cleaning needs. I did not have terribly ""dirty"" carpeting but wanted to get up surface soil and freshen up my carpets. I thought the cleaner performed well. It was easy to maneuver, easy to fill and empty the water tank, and the carpeting dried very quickly and completely within a couple hours. I liked that the carpet cleaner worked well to draw up the water and dry up the carpet so fast. For this reason, I will not hesitate to use it more often throughout the year. Now, the next test will be my carpeting in the Fifth Wheel RV with dirtier carpeting following our summer vacations. I feel confident it will perform well and dry quickly. If it doesn't, I will be letting everyone know!"
4,Hoover SteamVac cleans up,"I replaced a Bissell with this SteamVac and am very happy with the results so far. Both suffer from being made of plastic, but the Hoover outshines -- the color of the pick-up water confirms that there was a lot of ""stuff"" in that carpet.I would have give the SteamVac the fifth star but for one detail: despite the manual showing how to use the hard floor cleaner, the attachment did not come in the box. I called Hoover and ordered one for the mighty sum of $3.22, with free shipping. Why couldn't they just put it in -- it would have been better all around."
2,hoover carpet cleaner---sent used ---not new,"cleaner arrived as promised, but when I opened box and started to assemble unit it looked as though it had been used---and refurbished by mfr.--solution tank had residue on seal and filling port was scratched and alignment ears worn, ac plug prongs were bent, some areas that were printed were barely readable,cleaning solution residue was around the mounting holes for the attachment screws.Given all of that I still decided to give it a try anyway, to my surprise it did a pretty good job of cleaning the carpet, it does leak if left standing though.I really did not want to go through all the issues of sending it back etc., I guess the blame would be on the mfr. not Amazon ?...it was listed as NEW for the price that was on line, not used."
4,very good,"I only use once so far but it is exactly as describe, had no mechanical problems at all, it does a very good job. But of course i have to use few more times, and if something happend I will update this review. If you are looking for a carpet cleaner I believe this is a good choice."
5,NO BRAINER!,"You can teach a first grader how to use it. Have tried my best to wear it out. Let my children take it to their homes. Probably the best dollars for value I have seen in a long time. Just make sure you treat it with kindness. I dropped mine down the stairs and it cracked part of the handle. But, I fixed it with a good tube of epoxy glue and still works fine.Cons? Just make sure you read the instructions a little bit before using it. But that is just for those whodon't believe in reading instructions. It could appear to be a little quirky at times if you don't understand what is going on.For example>>>>> You HAVE to make sure the reservoir lid for the return water is put back on just right after cleaningor it will not suction at all. Sounds like it is working..but nothing happens. Just have to snap the top back on correctly."
3,aggravating machine,"I purchased this because we owned an older model that had a problem with the hose coming off causing leaking. The newer model is great on carpets. Where i have a problem is with the need to attach the hose. I have to lower the handle then attach the hose. When the handle lowers this causes water to leak from the reservoir. Then to empty the bucket you have to remove the hose, etc, again leading to leaking. It is not a good model if you are changing from floor to furniture but is ok if you just want to do one or the other."
4,Very easy to use,"The biggest problem with this carpet cleaner is the instruction booklet.It really makes it alot more complicated than it needs to.And nothing is in order of using it.But once I realized that I did not need to even use the big hose (only used on furniture)....I zoomed thru the rooms with ease.The dirty water holder does not hold much, so that needs to be emptied a couple of times for each large room. But it is pretty easy to do.It really cleans well. I would recommend this to others."
3,It's ok,Overall it works! I am disappointed at the hand tools. The vacume also arrived with a plastic part missing so the unit doesn't stand up.
5,Very handy to have!,"I'm so glad I have this! It's quick and easy to use and it has already paid for itself! We used to rent the Rug Doctor from our local grocery store, but the Hoover SteamVac does just as good a job, is much lighter in weight and easier to maneuver. A must have for houses with rugs or carpet!"
5,great for the money,i bought this because of thr reviews and i must say they were right it is a lot better than the bissell that i hd before this puchase!
4,Very happy,"This is my first steamvac,have rented in the past. Most useful feature to me is the weight-always needed my husband to operate the Rug doctor as it was just too heavy for me. I can solo with my new Hoover.I took the advice here of pre-treating and adding some boiling water and the carpets look great and dried in a few hours. Haven't tried the upholstery tool yet,that's next weekend. My only complaint is that as stored, the hose is awkwardly placed near the push pedal that lowers the handle-I ended up taking the hose off the machine while I cleaned. A great buy with the June special of $25 off and I expect I'm going to use it a lot more often than I rented since it's so easy to use."
4,No More Rug Doctor,"After years of renting Rug Doctors, we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner. We were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our off-white carpets when they come in from playing. Also one of them is a puppy, who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times. After reading other reviews, we selected the Hoover F5914-900. We wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the Hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner. The carpets are as clean as with a bigger Rug Doctor. We have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time. We are very happy with our Hoover. It is fairly light, easy to fill and empty, and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes. As other people have commented, the attachment hose tends to fall off, so we just leave it off. Otherwise, it's a heck of a deal!"
3,Good for spills,"I liked the product , It cleans well and does pick up spills. but it doesn't heat water so we have to pour hot water in the water in let which is not very convenient. Water tends to cool down soon so I end up refilling the water in let frequently. We have a large living room so I have to fill water at least twice."
4,Assembly From Hell,"The point's been made that this is a great carpet cleaner. It is. I used it yesterday and was happy with the results. You should totally get it.There's a couple down sides though, and that's assembly/learning the tricks of how to use it. Putting this cleaner together isn't quick and easy. In fact it was a serious pain.HOWEVER, once I got past all that and a few trial and error sessions of the dirty water tank not being picking up because it wasn't situated properly, it worked well. The carpet is clean and fluffy once more. The dry time is EXCELLENT. You won't be stuck with soggy carpet for that long.Be prepared for a hassle the first time you use it. After that, it should be smooth sailing."
4,worked great,"Thanks to everyone who shared their experiences and tips. I read them before putting mine together,which helped make sense of some of the written instructions provided with the vac; everything worked as it should. The vac was easy to use and much more cost effective. I had called for carpet cleaning estimates. The best deal was a minimum of $75, but they wouldn't move any ""heavy"" furniture. With my own vac, I could take the time to move furniture and do a thorough job."
1,Stopped working in under 15 minutes,"After cleaning an area approximately 4'x 5' the machine started to smoke. We immediately shut it down. We tried to turn it on again after checking the machine over, and it would not turn on. We called Hoover and could never get through to a live person. The only option was to leave a message and they promised to return the call. We also emailed the company. We never heard back from them. Thank goodness for Amazon! They had the machine picked up within 2 days at no cost to us and we received a full refund."
4,WOW ! Fantastic!,"I am the mother of five kids ,4boy & 1 girl,3 Yorkies, two cats and two hamsters. I needed a cleaner that could help me keep my home clean. I am a neat freak anyway and my home is only two yrs old so I did not think my floors were that dirty. OH my gosh....eeewwwwww YUCK! This machine is the best at getting the dirt out of the carpet. So easy to use REALLY! Your not filling the clean water tank every 2 seconds like I thought I would. And the suction is great too! The dirty tank has just about the amount that is missing from the clean tank.The only thing I would like to see improve is the suction with the hand tools.Overall I am very pleased,and I think you all will be too! Well worth the money and I have the feeling this one is going to last me for years."
5,exactly what i needed,"I researched carpet cleaners for a reasonable price and came across this one. the fact that there are so many buyers and reviews i figured id give it a try. i purchased it, put it together and used it right away. i noticed that it wasnt picking up the water, so i was like ""oh great!"" i read the manual and realized the top of the dirty water tank wasnt on right. i gave it another try and it worked perfectly!!! we have a lot of cats, this cleaned our bedroom of all pet smells and the carpet looked fresh and clean! the water looked like mud. this vacuum works. i will recommend this to everybody!!"
3,Plastic broke off (i just bought it 3 months ago!!!),"This really seemed like a great buy..cleaned my carpet well. But last week a piece of plastic just broke off and now it has no suction! Thank God for the 1 yr warranty, but i hate when that runs out The plastic is VERY cheap and the machine just doesnt seem like it will hold up in the long run :("
2,Broke after about a year's use,"I love a clean carpet and since the vacuum cleaner I currently have works fine, I decided to buy a carpet shampooer/steamer. l went to my local store and bought Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge which worked ok, not as good as my old platinum, but it did the job. Low and behold the machine worked for about a year and the suction mechanism stopped working! I have a fairly big house, but I am the only person living in it and I mainly used it on the high traffic areas. I wear no shoes nor do I allow anyone to wear shoes in my home and these 2 machines just gave up on me. I am extremely disappointed.I will probably not buy any more hoover products ever again."
2,Worked Good for a little while,"This worked well for a couple months, then it would stop sucking up the water. I could play around with it and get it to work again. Then a couple times longer it just stopped sucking up water. I threw it in the garbage last week."
5,Carpet cleaner works great,We are pleased with this carpet cleaner. We didn't realize that our carpets were even dirty but the water was dirty making us realize that we should clean the carpets a couple of times per year and using this is so much better than renting a carpet cleaner. Also we used this to clean the carpets in our RV and the results were amazing. The carpet is a deep blue and now looks like new. I feel we got a good price on this and will use it for many years.
2,"was good in the first 6 months,broke down after 1.5 year","I really loved this product when I first got it. It picked up tons of dirt from the carpet . We have 2 cats so we use it quit often. Today I used it again, it got smoky and died. I called hoover, passed warranty date. will give me 20% off for a new one.. disappointed!"
3,"Works good, but broke after 1 month","Like it says in the title, it works like it is supposed to. We got it for a new dog that needed to be trained and this cleans up after it well.The cons:Kind of loud, but you aren't really going to find a super quiet oneA piece of plastic that holds the unit up broke, so now it just lays flat instead of standing up right. It was not used hard, in fact it was just sitting there and all of a sudden fell over. So, not real sure about the quality but for the price we couldn't complain. I will call and get it fixed under warranty."
4,Hoover SteamVac,"I gave this as a gift, so I can't comment on it, except the person that received it said it did a good job."
2,Not what i expected.,"This product does not removes stains very well. Its more for everyday use and not actual deep cleaning. I had a few stains where juice and coffee were spilled and tried to go over the spots a few times but it didnt remove any of it. I'm assuming the stains were too deep for the short brushes to reach. I even tried leaving it on a stained section with the brushes running at full speed, but it just looked like someone wore out my carpet in that spot.Overall, good for very light cleaning, removing dust, surface dirt, but will not remove deep stains."
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this thinking in the middle price range I was going with a good thing, especially after reading the reviews, well most of them. First assembly was easy except putting the back hose on was a little confusing but no big deal. Well for one the steam is for drying the carpet not for cleaning. Next, it left all the water in my carpet it sucked up some dirt and dust but no water, I felt underneath and to me there was hardly any vacuum power, next I tried using the spinning attachment and it went so slow that it didn't clean anything. I sent it back for a refund think I will try a bissel this time, my bissel vacuum can suck a bag up 3 inches away, no joke either lol. I do however like the two tank system, too bad mine didn't suck any water up. As always though, Amazon is the best place to buy, hassle free return, wonderful customer service and great prices. I will always buy from Amazon Thank you Tracey"
3,Advertised new. Was CLEARLY used.,THIS WAS ADVERTISED AS NEW BUT WAS CLEARLY USED!!! The packaging was ripped and damaged inside. The steamvac was dirty and scratched. I'm really disappointed.
2,"Worked Great, then...","Suction is fantastic. Detergent distribution is very good. I would highly recommend this except for one overwhelming fact. It's designed to break.The first thing you'll notice with this unit is that the triggers are very stiff, uncomfortable to use and fragile. Your hand will become tired very quickly holding the triggers. They will also fail after about 15 to 20 cleaning. The plastic retainers built into the handle for the pivot points for the triggers is thin and very weak. There's no possible way they could last long at all. The replacement part is available online for under $10, but count on it failing soon, too.The entire upper portion of this unit could use a complete redesign. The lower portion seems fine."
2,Prefer More Expensive Models,This machine uses soap in the main tank preventing going back and forth between soap and rinsing. For this reason I don't like it. I have the more expensive model with dual tanks and just love it. I was so unhappy with this purchase that I returned it and fixed mine. This model also has a very very short cord so you'll have to constantly move the cord around as you use it.Nevertheless it does clean the carpet although I prefer that more expensive model. Only buy Hoover if you want a carpet cleaner. I have Berber carpets and a dog and a cat so it's very necessary to have one!
4,Does the job,"Used it once soon after purchase. Pretty easy to assemble and use. Pulled a LOT of dirt out of our carpet, despite regular vacuuming. A tough spot or two remained, but maybe pre-cleaning as per directions would help. Overall, the machine did a really nice job. I've read customer complaints about cheap easily-broken plastic, but I'm guessing, with some common-sense care in assembling and disassembling parts and manipulating controls, etc., the unit should hold up reasonably well. Clean-up can be a bit messy, but a lot easier than our previous Hoover portable."
5,An awesome product!,We bought this item based on other reviews and are happy abt the purchase. It does the work though probably not at the same speed as the high end industrial cleaners. We used it twice so far and think its definitely worth the money.
1,Not what I first thought...,"When I first received this scrubber I put it together (which was easy) and used it right away. We have 3 dogs and 2 cats so this is something we have wanted to get in case of any accidents. It worked really good for what is was although definitely not the results of a professional. Nevertheless, if you're an animal owner it can be a life saver. All was well until about a week later when I went to use it and the suction power had stopped and the brushes weren't spinning quickly anymore. Disappointed, we just decided to return in. On the upside, Amazon was great about returning it. Just fill out a short request and it gives you a label to print out. Then you can choose if you want to drop it off at UPS or they come and get it for you. My refund was back in my account (including shipping) in less than a week! I love Amazon, but not this product!"
1,Received a used cleaner,"I was very disappointed when I opened my box after paying for one day shipment only to get a used cleaner. I called Amazon, they apologized and have sent a new one out, hopefully this time it will not be used. I had read at least one review of this happening to someone else. I'll update once I receive the replacement."
1,please help,"We just purchased the Hoover Silver F5950900 after reading reviews on various cleaners. In the Silver reviews I read that the parts did not seem very sturdy, but due to the positive reviews we purchased anyway. Well, we are taking it back because it has definitely been used/returned to store however, the parts are sooo incrediby cheap we are hesitant to replace with the same sweeper. I truly cannot believe that this cleaner could last for more than a short time. My question is, are ALL of these steamvacs so cheaply made??"
2,Broke after 22 monts,"Bought this 1/31/10 and everything was going fine, but used it yesterday and it no longer extracts water from carpet or bare surface. Expected better from a Hoover product and after the reviews written on Amazon thought this was a good product, but I guess not. Thought it would last longer that 22 months. Would not recommend or buy again."
4,So far so good!,"After reading many reviews I recently purchased the Hoover steam vac due to the dirty high traffic areas and pet spots in my home. It definatly took all the dark areas out of the carpet. Doing the stairs was quite a chore. My hand was hurting from holding the hand trigger so much but it cleaned really well so I feel that it was worth the hard work. You do have to empty the water often and put in new clean water, but that didn't really bother me. I was excited to learn that you can buy an attachment for hard surface floors and plan to do so. I just hope that it lasts a long time without any repairs, as I have read that steam vacs in general do not last long. That being said this model seems to have gotten the best reviews. For the price I would definatly recommend the Hoover Steamvac w/ Clean Surge."
5,Well worth the money,"I decided to purchase this Carpet Cleaner because of the reviews on Amazon, and it was a great choice. I have a 3yr old and a Cat that constantly makes a mess on the carpet. We got our carpets cleaned professionally every few months and it started to get expensive so I decided to purchase this. It works great, but be prepared to go through a lot of carpet cleaning solution and spend a good hour to hour and a half for a decent size living room. It cleans well, but its not ""fast"" so you have to go over the area several times to get out the stains."
4,carpet cleaner,Very happy with this product. Used it to clean up a heavy spill on my carpet and it worked great. Same issues with tank capacity as other reviewers but it works great as a steam cleaner so that is all that matters.
4,SteamVac,"I like this item very much. The price was very good and it works very well.Okay, I wrote that when I first got the thing. Now, two years later, I'd like to add that the ""tools"" part only worked once...the next time I tried to clean my stairs no liquid could be sprayed out. And, after two years of admittedly frequent use, the machine has lost most of it's suction. After several calls to Hoover it appears that the seal on the waste water tank has compressed. I can't buy a new seal or even a new top portion, my only recourse is to buy an entire waste tank at a cost of $30.00-$35.00. That's close to 1/4 of the original purchase price.Now it is Dec. 2012...I did buy the waste tank and there was NO improvement in the suction of this machine. I feel like I ""should have known"" that that would be the case."
1,Didn't even use it once!,"The steam vac did not work right out of the box. Spent time going through all the instructions and then spent even more time trying to get through to customer service to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong. After more than 1/2 hour on the phone (most of that time spent on hold and some of the time spent talking to a rude customer service rep before I finally was able to talk to someone who could help), I found out that indeed, it was broken. Thanks HOOVER! Not the time saver I had expected after reading all the glowing reviews on this site."
5,This thing is amazing!!!,If you are even thinking about getting this. GET IT!! It does a great job on cleaning your carpet.
4,Great rug cleaner for the price,"I was discouraged after getting a estimate on the cost to clean the carpets in a couple of rooms in my house. I had seen in Consumer Reports their recommendation for a Hoover SteamVac. I then got online and saw the great reviews for the cheaper Hoover (F5914-900) and couldn't resist the price of $132 (including shipping!). It was cheaper to buy a new rug cleaner than to have them cleaned professionally. It was delivered two days earlier than what the tracking data indicated.I cleaned all the carpets in my house with ease. It does a great job and I was glad about my decision to buy it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to all the plastic parts and because it isn't a ""steam vac"" as its name implies. But hot water added to the tank seemed to work well enough. It does a great job of ""vacuuming"" the water from the carpet so that the drying time was less than expected.All in all, a great machine for the price."
5,Hoover SteamVac Rocks!,"I researched several cleaners before purchasing this one based on consumer reviews. The Cleaner is every thing that I had hoped it would be. Used it last night on our Den carpet where we spend 99% of our time. We have 2 dogs and a 9 year old. The carpet looks fantastic. Took my time over the heavily travelled areas. Used the hottest tap water I could and it did just fine. The premium pet cleaning solution smells wonderful. Cleaned at night so it could dry overnight and carpet was not even damp to touch this morning. Easy to put together and very easy to fill and empty. Will clean my stairs tonight and hate to say I am excited about cleaning, but this Steamer is WELL worth the money."
4,Ssgt Tim,"This is the second one I received. First was damaged by UPS. Amazon issued return tag and I received a new one in two days. Thats service. The unit cleans very well. I used all attachments with no incidents. The only question I have is this ""it was advertised as a steam vac"". No steam at all! I don't feel warm water-no puffs of steam?Yes the cleaner and dirty water tanks are fairly small, but for most people it is not too heavy. If you incresed the tank size, alot of users would be exhausted pushing the dead weight around. So I rate positive for the tank size. You can't beat the price! Just wish it was a real steam carpet cleaner."
4,Wow!,"This is a great carpet cleaner. I could not believe the color of the water the first time I used it!!! Carpet stayed wet for about 2-4 hours after cleaning. Product is somewhat difficult to set up initially, but once you get the hang of it it's not bad. Product is a little heavy to use, but works well. Also, it does leak if you forget to lock the handle in place AFTER EACH TIME YOU CHANGE THE WATER. You must remember to push the black button on the underside of the handle. All in all it's a good carpet cleaner and I would recommend it to others."
3,OK so far,"Had the unit about a month now, so far, no real problems. I don't like the fact that this model does not have a simultaneous clean/rinse option like my previous one had. I used to be able to clean in the forward path, then auto rinse in the reverse path. You now have to scrub first, remove all of the cleaning solution in the tank, then refill with fresh water to rinse. Had I know this prior to purchase, I would not have done so.What really amazed me was Amazon's shipping, The unit arrived in 2 days and thiswas with the free shipping option. Fantastic."
4,Hoover F5914,"Took a few minutes to put together but well documented.I Vacuumed my Carpet with a Kirby and it looked Clean, cleaned it with the SteamVac and the residue water was dirtier that I anticipated.It does an Excellent Job.I went over the Wet Carpet slowly and it Dried in just a few Hours Completely.I feel this SteamVac is Worth the money I spent.I wanted to buy a Hoover as opposed to another Brand to insure parts were available instead of waiting a few weeks for Parts.Good Choice.The Only Con I noticed was how frequent I had to change water/residue tank. on a 12 by 25 Room i Changed 5 times.No Complaints it is easy to change."
4,Nice and convenient,Very good suction pulls up water at a terrific rate. Makes you wish the dirty water container was larger than a gallon. Kept pulling dirty water out of my carpet application after application. Makes a big difference in traffic dirt. Not so much on spot problems.
4,Great product,This is my 2nd Hoover SteamVac. The old one lasted much longer than it should have. Being so pleased with it I bought another one. So far I am just as pleased with this one. The only problem I see with it is when it is in the upright locked position. It doesn't sit quite upright and so with no water in the tanks it tends to tip over easily. But that doesn't seem to affect it when I'm using it. So I can certainly deal with that.
4,HOOVER CARPET CLEANER,"Does a decent job. Only complaint is that the tank is only 1 gallons so after every 5 minutes you are stopping to change the water. To remove the waste water you need to get down on your hands and knees. Ok at first but after the 20th time gets old. Does not have a heater but since you go through the water so fast I dont think you need one.Consumers reports will come out with a review of cleaners in 2009. Bought online, free shipping from Amazon. Would buy again."
4,Carpet Cleaner,"Overall, this seems to be a really good product. I've used it a number of times since I got it including cleaning one very large empty house that had been owned by a heavy smoker. It does a fine job. The containers for liquids are not too large, so they need to be refilled and emptied more often than I'd like, but there is no way around that without making the machine too large. I am pleased with it."
5,Great Improvement,"I recently ordered your Hoover Steam Vac. I have had two carpet cleaners in the past, one Hoover and one Bissel. Each lasted less than 4 years. I must say this machine is an improvement. The suction is excellent. Also the manufacturer has eliminated the cleaning solution dispenser. It was the first thing in the last two machines that began to leak or malfunction. I found this SteamVac easier to handle and maneuver. The only thing I miss is a handle on the dirty water tank for lifting. I use it on wall to wall carpet, high quality area rugs, and the lesser grade carpeting RV manufacturers put in motorhomes. The last challenge, coming home from a camping trip, was the real test! At this price, if it lasts as long as the others, I will have really gotten my money's worth."
1,Surprised this was not what I had hoped for,"I had an earlier generation of this cleaner, and loved it for the 7 years I had it. When time came to replace it, I naturally wanted the same level of cleaning. What I got less than 9 months ago is not what I expected. The cleaning aspect is awesome. The problem is two fold. I followed the instructions, and after the 2nd use, leaking. Then after the 3rd use, no suction, so I was left with a wet dirty carpet. Would not waste your time or money with this product."
5,Outstanding,Had an Orek shampoer that continually broke down. This Hoover cleans very well and is easy to use. Very well built. I was very surprised at how much of a machine you get for the money.
3,Not bad for the money,"I am satisfied with my Hoover steamvac. It cleans the carpet and lifts the dirt. I wish it had larger resevoirs for clean and waste water, but that can't be helped. Not sure why its called a steamvac when it doesn't heat the water. You must fill it with hot water in order to have hot water cleaning your carpets."
4,Hoover,"Ok, I got this product scared that it wouldn't work because of the mixed reviews. However, I am very pleased with its performance. It was simple to put together, and it cleaned the carpets very well. I will say that it is CRUCIAL TO MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE BOTTOM TANK LID ON CORRECTLY. FROM FRONT TO BACK. If it doesn't snap on the suction will not work. No leaks, no problems. Just follow the instructions."
5,Excellent!,"The Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900 performed an exceptional job. Easy to assemble, easy to use! The savings it will give, make it a huge bargin. Beside it cleaning more than well, it's suction had my carpet dry in little more than an hour. A boast no professional carpet clean can make. Also, the machine is light weight enough to make the chores no tireroing than using a vacuum cleaner. I highly recommend this product!"
1,First 4 months and it's been in for warranty repair twice.,"The Hoover Steam Vac works well, when it does work. The problem is that it's prone to breaking -- most recently, the brushes stopped spinning. I took it in for repair under warranty and just got it back today. No sooner had we started using it than it immediately stopped working again: this time the brushes have stopped spinning and the soap isn't dispensed unless you hit the clean surge button. I have done all the things recommended by the manual, cleaning the little screen, the brushes, etc., and nothing gets the brushes going again. This thing is just shoddily made, and I wouldn't recommend taking a chance on it. I don't have any faith that it will last beyond the warranty, so unfortunately I have to say that it's just a waste of money."
1,got one of the resent back ones I guess,"mine arrived in a box of good condition taped well etc... very timely which would be a plus. But when I opened and was putting it together I realised a few parts or attachments were missing, but could work around that problem or thought. There were cracks in the tanks and bottom we didn't notice till it was on and water was coming out everywhere then the nice burning smell was all it took for me to fear the worse. I think someone ordered this it got sent back to factory in worse condition then they intial got it in and didn't send all the parts back. so I had to have professional come and clean the water the towels didn't soak up on xmas eve and my kids were afraid to turn on or touch anything afraid it would smell of fire n smoke later too"
1,Lasted 1 use before water started leaking out the bottom,"After seeing the good reviews for this product, I bought this steamer to replace a similar Hoover model that lasted 15-20 years. This product lasted for one cleaning. It did not do a very good job cleaning. My old steamer was much better at removing dirt. The second time I tried to use it, water started pouring out of the bottom. I ended up throwing it in the trash. Then I noticed similar reviews for this product from many people that had the same problem. Apparently, it is a roll of the dice with this steamer. Some people seem to have gotten a good product. The one I, and many others got was a lemon. I would not take a chance a second time with such poor quality control."
1,JUNK,"So far so good. Worked really good right out of the box. Easy to put together,easy to use and did a good job. Now hope it last longer then my Bissell Pro did. Was more expencess then Hoover but only lasted about 15 Months.OK,I used this three (3) times and plastic parts started falling of. Then stoped working.Three strikes and your OUT. Get what you pay for. If you buy this then remember (from a buyer that did) you gat what you pay for!!!!"
5,Diana,"I purchased the Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac after trying to clean our carpet with a canister type steam cleaner. What a difference it made. It cleans extremely well, and it is fast and easy to use, and taking apart the cleaner to clean it was extremely easy as well. It took approximately 15 to 20 minutes to stream clean a medium sized bedroom and that was withtaking my time. I would definetely recommend this steam cleaner to anyone."
5,Fantastic Cleaner,"Our rugs were pretty dirty, so I wondered if they would come clean without a professional cleaning. Wow they came out beautiful now I had to clean them twice to get the results I was looking for, but there was a lot of traffic on these rugs. I did purchase the spot cleaner by Hoover and before doing the second time I sprayed them down lightly with the spray and waited about fifteen minutes, I also start with very hot water to hurry the process. The machine has paid for itself already, and I'm super pleased with the results."
4,"Great on carpets, wish it would heat the water","This vacuum works as well on our carpets as the rented professional one, and it much much lighter and easier to manage. I can't believe how much dirt our dog brings in, it's amazing to see it all sucked out! And most importantly I was very impressed by how well it dries the carpet, it sucks the water out very well, and the carpet was dry about 5 hours later.The hardwood floor cleaning also works well, but for really dirty spots where something is really stuck to the floor, you'll have to pretreat it.My only complaint is that this unit does not heat the water, so there is no actual steam. So fill the tank with the hottest water you can, and then use it right away."
4,Works great,"This cleaner replaced a much older Hoover that had given up the ghost. I used it the first weekend to clean the carpet in our living room. Normally I have my husband help me, but he was gone, and I put it together and did the work myself. Very easy to follow instructions for assembly, and it worked great. I have no negative comments at all, but am giving it 4 stars instaed of 5 because I do not believe anything is perfect.Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surge"
4,Hoover Stem Vac,"The Hoover StemVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge arrived quickly. Thank goodness, because wehave a new puppy. While trying to potty train her, we were having to hand clean up all her accidents.The Hoover Stem Vac Carpet cleaner quickly cleaned up our carpets helping us to get rid of odors frompast accidents, helping to reinforce our training. We are so glad to have the vac handy for those timeswhen hand cleaning just doesn't cut it."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"When I received my Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner, I read and re-read and re-read the directions for installing the parts. Well, because of the great reviews that I had read that highly recommended this product I just stuck with it and I was able to put it together the same night. I am writing this after having it in my home for several weeks only because I just did not want to clean the carpet. Now that I have had the experience with this carpet cleaner I am sold on it. It was just like vacuuming, it was light to push and I even tried the hose and tools for my steps. I would recommend this Hoover SteamVac to anyone who needs the help and wants to do it themselves. My carpet looks better than it has in years. Thanks for such high recommendations that led me to purchase it."
4,good quality for price,"After reading reviews on amazon.com, I ordered the Hoover carpet steamer. I had been reluctant to ever order another Hoover product after a bad experience with the Hoover FloorMate. Typical of Hoover's products, this machine seems cheaply made: lots of plastic and flimsy brushes. However, the machine was easy to use and did a very good job on our carpets in four rooms. Some reviewers did not like having to empty the dirty water tank so often. This was not a negative for me since frequent changes gave me short breaks and meant a lighter tank of water to carry. Also, the machine extracted water nicely and carpets dried in a few hours. Overall, this machine was a good purchase. As usual, Amazon's delivery service was exceptional: order arrived quickly."

5,Amazing,I have owned 3 carpet cleaners and hands down this is the best.My carpets looked brand new after using this the first time. Lightweight and easy to clean. I love it!!!
1,Lost suction within months,"I might as well have thrown my money in the wind! Within a few months, the cleaner started losing suction. I find myself lucky if the suction stays on for more than 15 seconds. I couldn't return because it was beyond return period. Never buying a Hoover again."
