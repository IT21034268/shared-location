1,What a Load!,"This book contains 1/4 fact, 1/4 repetition of those facts, 1/2 off base, unsubstantiated opinion. In each chapter the author shares a morsel of actual information and then goes off making strange statements with no references or reasons as to how he came to these conclusions. There has GOT to be a better book on this subject. This one is just plain BAD."
4,Great desktop reference for Technical Writers,"This is a great reference tool for anyone starting out in the technical communications field! This book is very user friendly. It's apparent once you start flipping through the pages. All the topics, such as, ""Editing and Proofreading,"" ""Page Layout,"" and ""Word Problems,"" are organized in alphabetical order and printed on the outside edge of the page's header in large easy-to-read font. I also appreciate the way each topic has the keypoints summarized at the beginning with numbers that corresponds to an in-depth discussion of the keypoints. The enclosed CD-ROM was also a great addition to this book. This book is a worthwhile investment!"
1,Unfortunate,"This is a wonderful reference book. Unfortunately, it embodies a politically correct communication philosophy that makes it worthless. Don't waste your money. There are better reference books out there and they don't promote a polical/social philosoply."
2,Very vague,"This book has some excellent sketches, but VERY lacking in explanation. The whole thing was kind of like Step 1: Draw the outline using a thin line, Step 2: Draw everything else.Might be a good book if it had more instruction."
2,Not engaging for little kids,"This product while a good book,is definitely not one that will draw the interest of children. The illustrations are very poor, my kids have not picked it up again since after we received it. Will not recommend for little kids, maybe the older kids(if they can find it interesting)."
2,Bedtime Bible Story Book,I did not like the pictures and illustrations. They seemed harsh and scary for a child. And the quality of the paper was not as expected.
5,Jesse Lyman Hurlbut puts the Bible in a nutshell.,As a homeschool mom I use this book daily with all my children. It's a highly accurate interpretation that can be as simple or as thought provoking as you choose to make it. It's chronological format makes the Bible easier for anyone to understand and enables you to understand it as it pertains to world history.
4,awesome,"This book The Bedtime Bible Story Book [Illustrated] [Paperback]Jesse L. Hurlbut (Author), Toni Sortor (Editor), Kathy Arbuckle (Illustrator)IS AWESOME. I believe that my children do not need the watered down version of the bible. This gives the the truth.Make sure you have the correct author as there is one imposter that looks similar and is watered down."
3,365 Read Alone Bedtime Bible Stories,I bought this book to read to my grandchildren at night. As soon as Isaw it I knew they probably wouldn't be interested in reading it becauseit didn't have colored pictures in it and I was right.
3,no color illustrations,"Yes this book includes 365 Bible stories. However they are very short and there is no color in this book at all. I like to read to my 8 month old every night after dinner. Its important for a baby his age to be exposed to a lot of colors and shapes. I made an assumption that just because the covor was colorful the rest of the book would be to, but it wasn't. :( All in all I still read it to him, but he just stares elsewhere since everything is black and white."
3,Stories are too short,The stories are too short and somehow they seem not to be written for a child in the age category. There was few illustrations and the were also not of great quality. What I did like is that it starts day one in the beginning of the bible and the questions after each story were easy enough to understand for my almost 4yr old.
3,Allright,"This book is allright, not quite what I expected. It is a good book for a parent to read to a child though. I just wish I had looked for a hardback version of the book."
3,Great book but costs 50% cheaper at Borders,"I bought 6 copies for my nephews. It is a great bed time read, kids in 2nd grade and older can read on their own, however younger kids will also enjoy listening as you read to them.My only problem is I was really angry when I realised it would have cost me only $2.97 if I had walked in to any Borders store."
2,B&W limited illustrations,"I purchased this Bible for my 8 year old daughter. I was hoping for an illustrated, easy-to-read version of the stories in the Bible. Maybe I was reading too much into the description and reviews. The type is larger ... fine. The illustrations are few and ONLY B&W drawings!!! No interesting or colorful illustrations or photos. So, in summary, if you are looking for a paperback Bible with a few illustrations and larger type, then this may be for you. But, it you are looking for color and interesting pictures to go with Bible stories, you may want to choose another version."
1,"something is really ""not quite right""","I agree with one of the other reviewers, most of the reviews here have to be about another book. I got this book with high hopes and much anticipation, however, there were some ""issues"" with the content. I'm not sure what version of the Bible these stories are derived from, but there is something wrong with almost every story. At first, I thought that I was just being a little nit-picky but as the days progressed the inconsistencies only got worse. I'm not talking about just some added dialogue to ""fluff"" the stories for children, but facts and story lines were completely off (not to mention weird). In the end you will spend about 3 min reading the text and fifteen trying to explain to your kids ""what the fruit"" you just read. If you value your children's Biblical foundation at all, You REALLY want to take advantage of Amazon's peek feature and read through the first five or six chapters."
2,One paragraph stories,"It isn't what I expected. The stories are mostly one paragraph and a picture. It's not horrible or anything, but the stories feel way too short to me. It's kind of like reading only the headlines on the news. I'm not impressed and am still looking for a Bible story book for little one."
5,bedtime stories,"I bought this for my son so we could start reading to him at bedtime and start establishing bible stories. It wasn't what I expected however, I thought there would be more picture since my 3 year old is into pictures while he listens to stories. We will have to wait until he is a little older to read it but I do like how the book is set up just by looking into it. Thank you!"
2,Book,Not easy to read and understand.my. 7 year got bored easily and didn't seem interested to listening to me read it. It was not fun to read it
4,This book is nondenominational,"Reviewed by Stephanie Rollins for Reader Views (5/07)When I received ""365 Read-Aloud Bedtime Bible Stories"" to review, I was quite surprised. I had been reading from this book for years.There area over 100 illustrations in this book, but they are not colored. Each Bible story is one page or less. Of course, there are 365 stories--one for each day. There is not enough color and too many words for preschoolers; however, it is perfect for grade-schoolers.The Bible reference is at the top of each page. At the bottom of each page is a question about the story.I have read a few children's Bible stories that were slanted toward a certain denomination's beliefs or practices. This book is nondenominational It is strictly Biblical. This is a great way for parents to incorporate religion at home. The words are simple enough for beginning readers to sound out. ""365 Read-Aloud Bedtime Bible Stories"" is a great book for your grade-schooler.Book received free of charge."
1,Boring! Look for My Book of Bible Stories instead.,"The pictures are pitiful and the stories are boring, compared to what I was used to... I read this in a doctor's office to my granddaughter and she was bored, too. She said that she wished they had the ""My Book of Bible Stories"" that I had at home. After that, I put one in my car so I always have it handy when little ones are with me. NOTE: As one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I would gladly have donated one of My Book of Bible Stories to this clinic, but they wouldn't allow it--so sad that many children and adults have no idea what they are missing due to prejudicial attitudes by certain adults, sigh. The sad part is that the My Book of Bible Stories has the actual Biblical references listed at the bottom of each page, so any adult who questioned anything can freely know right where to go in their own Bible to make sure the Scriptures really say that, so I don't understand what the concern is."
2,Not what I expected,"I was a bit disappointed in this. Not that I believe our children should only hear parts of Scripture and not the whole - but - there were some stories that were not ""softened"" (for lack of a better term) for the ears of children. (i.e. speared in the stomach and the intestines falling out). Not really good ""bedtime"" stories. I put this one away until my toddler is a little older!"
1,Cain Murders His Brother,"I have a hard time believing the folks who assembled this collection are very sensitive to children. I flipped through the ""see inside"" and found the chapter title Cain Murders His Brother. Just because it is written in the Bible doesn't mean it's suitable for children or at bedtime."
1,Excellent book!,I purchased this book for my 6 year old daughter. She really loves this book. She is able to read the stories on her own. We discuss the questions after she reads a story. This is a great book for her.
5,Smashing!,"Ideal for people who like Bible stories at bedtime and who know other people within earshot who also like Bible stories at bedtime, or for people who like Bible stories at bedtime and who wish to displease an enemy or rival who is within earshot and does not like Bible stories at bedtime or is trying to sleep. Equally suitable for people who like one Bible story a night for a year or for people who like 365 Bible stories in one night. Also recomended for people who like illustrations of Bible stories."
2,A good book but above my little one's head.,It's okay for an older child I guess. I was looking for something for my 3 year old. It's just not right for her age.
4,great book,I ordered this book for my son. I think it is a great way for him to learn the bible stories all summarized to his understanding. And a great refresher for myself.
3,Bible stories for children,This is a nice book to have if you have children of grandchildren. Stories are usually one page and give a nice introduction to biblical characters. I you like quality in workmanship this is not the product for you. The material puts you in the mind of a comic book.
5,Great counting fun for pre-schoolers,My kids love this book. It is a simple one to ten counting book and they can count lots of things along the way. My two year old can count to ten as a result. Besides I love Noddy and his oh so cool car. If I become a millionaire I think I will customise one just like it.
4,Really nice,"Found this to be a good toy. It does have some loose tiny pieces which could be lost easily. Thought about gluing the plates, cups and saucers on to the table. But all in all a neat toy."
5,Comfy and great for cold-weather running,I wear these all winter when I run. They're warm enough that I don't need a second layer unless it gets below 20 degrees or so.
3,Under Armour Lady ColdGear Running Tights - Black,I was a little bit disappointed in the ColdGear running tights. I thought they would have compression and they didn't. The fit was really loose on me and that was surprising. I will still use these for running but they are not warm as I thought they would be so that too is a minus for me. I am sure that for most folks these tights are fine but for me I am not that impressed by the fit nor the material. I won't reorder.Maria C
5,Fannytastic!,"Great, with one small exception, the price. But you get what you pay for comes to mind. Love the way my butt looks in these."
3,Great if you have super small ankles,"These are great with one problem-they fit well and felt like they would be warm but the ankles were soooooo tight that I couldn't keep them. I have small ankles-I am 5'8"" and weigh 128 lbs. I know they are compression tights but it felt like they would have cut off circulation or cut into my skin. I tried pulling them down over my foot a little but still too tight on my foot. I think a bigger size would be too big everywhere else. I will have to try something else."
2,Waist is far too tight,"At 5'6"" and 133 pounds the size medium in these coldgear tights was FAR AND AWAY too uncomfortable to wear. I see other reviews commenting on the tightness of the ankles but the waist band is nothing more than a small bit of elastic string that literally digs into the top of my hips and stomach while I run.For my money, Target makes a pair of cold weather insulated tights in their C9 line that are fantastic. Skip the under armor, and their lofty price tag and get thee to Target for a much more comfortable, affordable option."
3,Too Tight,"I bought these compression tights to wear everyday during the winter in New England. The material is great; it's comfortable and keeps me warm. The only problem is the elastic at the bottom which cuts off the circulation in my feet. I've tried pulling the end over my socks or rolling them up to my ankles, but the elastic is too tight for my comfort. I'm 5'3"", 115 pounds, and I bought a small. I love Under Armour, and I recommend the fitted leggings which do not have the elastic band at the bottom end."
3,Warm but uncomfortable ankle elastic,"These were definitely warm, well-fitting, quality product. My only complaint is the tight elastic around the ankle. I wore these skiing and the elastic has a non-slip elastic band on the inside so that the tights don't slip up your leg. This is useful, but the elastic is fairly thick and I found it to be really uncomfortable in my ski boot. I moved the elastic over my heal so it wrapped around the middle of my foot and that helped, but I still had sore dark red marks. Length and size were fine for me, I am 5'3"" and ordered a small."
4,"Good, warm tights. No pocket. Tight ankles.","These tights are great - comfortable, warm. I've been wearing them on runs in 30 degree range weather. As others have mentioned, the ankles are pretty snug, but I don't notice it during runs and it does help keep you warm. My only complaint - there's no pocket for keys and such."
3,extremely tight ankles,"Bought a very similar pair over a year ago and loved them. But now they've made the ankles so tight, even on tiny ankles they're way too tight. Too bad because the fit is very nice elswhere. Nice material. Also the return process is a pain."
4,"Good, but not what I expected from Under Armour","First, I took the advice of other reviewers on here and ordered a size larger, but that was a bad idea. They are not super loose, but they are not like my other compression tights. A size larger than I normally wear and they are like regular sports tights.Second, I would definitely recommend layering them under sweatpants or warm ups if your temps hover at around 0F. They are warm, but not super warm for that weather. I'm sure once Spring comes, they'll be fine for running and staying warm in temps around freezing.I appreciate the extra elastic around the ankle. They don't hike up and they keep the cold air from coming in at my ankles.The only addition I would make is to add a small pocket. My other compression tights, from another company, have a zippered pocket at the back which is perfect for a house key."
4,Recycle needs re-issue,"Amazingly,this Galleria item contains the original track of Blue Danube used in 2001 A Space Odyssey. But this hodge podge release combines the best from Karajan's 1967 LP with the best from his sequel in 1971 (yet this latter has achieved definitive release on the prestigious ""Originals"" series with bonus tracks). The 1967 LP deserves the same, so let's keep our fingers crossed. Among several missing items here is the classic Overture to the Fleidermaus..Still, a great single CD of Strauss from Deutsche Grammophon."
5,"Great stories, well executed","I grew up with Tintin books, and my kids are now at an age where they are beyond ""See Spot Run"" but don't always have the patience for a full-length book. The stories are always great, and the research is meticulous. Most of the story subjects were highly topical at the time, and reading the books regularly provide history refresher.""The Castafiore Emerald"", though it is probably the least ""adventurous"" of the Tintin books, in my view has the most complex story structure, with a number of plots weaving into each other. A timeless classic.Herge is no stranger to the esoteric story, but ""Flight 714"" is clearly the most extreme in this respect. Still, a good story, and an opportunity to deal with a perennial nemesis.""Tintin and the Picaros"" again revisits old territory and old friends like General Alcazar and his Latin American banana republic. This book prompted a long discussion on guerillas and insurgencies with my 8-year-old."
3,There is a reason they put these three together,"It's funny how you can see Herge's style changes over time and yet stays the same. The Picaros is a long way from The Blue Lotus. While there three are not my favorites, they round out the TinTin collection. My [...] has enjoyed Flight 714 more than the other two. I give this 3 stars because his later work just seems like a weaker outing than his earlier work...Red Rackham's Treasure...Destination Moon."
2,Good price but little fun,This is the main problem with all foreign comics: translation. In the original language you get all the word plays and jokes that don't really translate into any other language. Reading it in English doesn't transmit even half of the fun.
1,this feeder kills birds,"I had no problems with this feeder for a while ( except for 2 of the circular pieces where the birds feed, fell out), then recently, I have had 2 dead birds trapped at the feeder within a week of each other. Two different species of bird - this feeder should be recalled - the birds heads get stuck inside and then the birds die!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Broke after 1 year,"Cute birdfeeder, but the solar lights stopped working after about a year. When they did work they were very weak as many solar lights are. Great idea but not a quality product."
2,Faulty Construction,"Bought two of these for gifts, both were rusted and fell apart within a year. Bad materials and faulty design. Its a shame because both liked it very much until it fell apart."
2,picture is not True !!,"This item from dorman 42549 will fit BUT !! the hose that comes with it doesn't have the rubber gromet that is molded to the hose in manufacturing to prevent water entering into the rear glass and into your truck.. the GM hose is premolded with the gromet sealed to the hose if you use this one from dorman u will have to some how try and seal it from leaking.. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.or find away to use the old hose where this picture came from i couldn't tell you.Either can Dorman when i spoke with dorman tech support they said the picture is wrong and NO gromet is on the hose, BUT they will look into it..since it really isn't an exact fit at this point..Dorman usually is right on with exact fit items to bad this is Not.."
2,Very Superficial,"This book had no substance behind. Information was thrown out as fact with no supporting evidence (on both sides), e.g., the wage comparisons -- where did this data come from?, what groups were studied?, etc.I am not sure how Julianne Malveaux got her PhD. Her writing is awful. She has no concept of personal responsibility. I am pro-choice but her argument for it is awful!!!!! Nothing about when a baby can be considered an actual person, etc.. I really am not sure how she got her Ph.D. -- by her accounts it may be through affirmative action but this is the fault with affirmative action -- it makes one question a persons true quilifications. She is a bad example of a liberal. I would consider myself a liberal but Deborah Perry was much more articulate in stating her point of view."
4,coldpacks,"Disposable Instant Cold Compress Pack 6""x9"" (48/case) (Purchased on 03/21/2009) by GoGoods.comExactly what I ordered & delivered pronto! Cold packs for the first aid boxes on every girls softball field in the league!"
3,Before His Prime,I'm a huge Steve O fan but this DVD is before his prime and while he did do a lot of crazy things none of them were tremendously entertaining. However if you like Steve O this is a really cool biography of his life.
2,A Romance Junkie,"Christos, handsome, rich alpha male falls in love with Becca the minute he spots her at his cousin Alex's wedding. Alex had seduced and left pregnant Becca's younger sister who later miscarried and lost the baby. So Becca had her reasons for hating all Carides men. Christos also hates his cousin Alex so already he and Becca have lots in common and the book should have been a great read right? Wrong. After the first few chapters it just goes down hill. Becca can't keep her hands of Christos and she gets pregnant. He more or less forces her to marry him and the woman is annoying. I like female characters in the book to have a voice and back bone but Becca turns from a smart school teacher into an argumentative ass!! And that's putting it mildly. I didn't care for this book at all."
5,Functional and Comfortable,"My teen daughter likes to use a sleep mask, but most of them on the market are ""cute"" but not comfortable. Plus, they tend to roll off during the night. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it...the eye sockets make it comfortable and the wide band keeps the mask in place all night. I'm told that it keeps things nice and dark as well, which is the whole point. My daughter has very long hair but doesn't seem to have a problem with tangles. This was a big success!"
2,Too stiff,"Although the light blocking is adequate if the mask is perfectly positioned on your face, the mask is too stiff. Therefore, when you turn onto your side, the whole mask shifts sideways as it's pushed up by your pillow, letting in light. It's also uncomfortably firm for side or stomach sleeping. Where this mask would excel would be if you were trying to sleep on an airplane, facing forward in your seat."
3,Not great for me maybe better for someone larger,"This mask is well made. The only problem I have is that is doesn't fit me very well. I'm a pretty small woman, and while the strap allows me to adjust the mask to fit snugly around my head, the mask itself is too large for my face. I have other masks that fit much better. Again, though, for someone larger, this would probably be a good fit."
3,Hard,"I've used many sleep masks over the years. This is the worst one I've ever used, although it is adequate. The problem is the mask is rather hard. It does have room for you to open your eyes while you have it on, but what you gain in movement, you lose in comfort. Because the mask is hard, the entire mask gets pushed to the side when I lie on my side. I have to readjust it frequently. I will not be purchasing this particular mask again. Additionally, the ear plugs are gigantic. I, a frequent user of ear plugs, could not make them thin enough to fit into my ear canal. Overall, not a good deal."
2,Not good,"It looks good but it's not. Yes it's true that it has holes where your eyes go, so there is no pressure around your eyes, but as a mask it's not flexible at all. It's only good when you sleep on your back and don't move at all the whole night. As you turn around and sleep on the side the mask will be pushed off of your face and if you place it back on it, it won't stay and it'll be inconvenient."
3,ok but not great for side sleepers,"disappointed that i didn't get any indication that it wasn't comfortable for sleeping on your side. too bulky and hurts my ears when i try...otherwise, very nice, if you sleep on your back. nice carrying pouch for travel and ear plugs included. nice that it has openings so that your eyes don't get squashed when you wear it. but again, for me, not a practical product overall."
2,Unsatisfied,"I've been using these for the past three nights and there won't be a fourth. I actually never made it through a full night with them on. They do a good job of blocking light but not great. The rigidity of material allows light to enter around the nose, although it's minimal. However, the comfort factor is terrible and if you sleep on your side forget it. I would say these are slightly more comfortable than swim goggles with the bulky feel of ski goggles. Sorry, but I feel like a ton of the reviewers on amazon could only be working for the companies or are the product makers themselves.Amazon, please make these reviews for customers who have no ties financially or otherwise to the products. A simple disclosure certification for the reviewer would do. Otherwise they are 100% useless. That goes for competitors as well. Buyers will begin to abandon amazon when they have been duped one too many times. Remember, testimonials are relied upon in the world of online purchasing."
4,"Very pleased, don't leave home without it!","I have been researching for a mask for quite some time. I was concerned because several people that purchased this mask expressed about how heavy it was. I've read lots of reviews and learned that you cannot make everyone happy; some things you have to just try out for yourself.Well, I am pleased to say that I have no complaints about this mask. It wasn't heavy to me at all. In fact the thickness of the mask seems to really keep out any light. I work a lot of night shifts so a mask that keeps out ALL light is essential. It was an adding bonus that is comes with ear plugs and a nifty carrying bag. If I loose this one I will definitely order another! So bottom line, try it for yourself. You have nothing to loose and you can return it if you don't like it.Pleasantly pleased:)"
3,Great for back sleepers,"I'd never used a sleep mask before and saw the high user ratings, so I tried this one in hopes I could relax with a contraption that has a strap around my head just to keep the light out. It was wicked comfortable when I had the back of my head on the pillow. Unfortunately, being a side sleeper, when I put my face sideways on the pillow it didn't feel good - kind of lumpy. I sent it back. If this wouldn't be an issue for you, I'd recommend it."
2,It's like wearing your ski goggles at night!,"Wow these are bulky, and stiff. It feels like wearing a pair of ski goggles while you are sleeping. I got these because of the good reviews and the strap connection that isn't in the back. But these really aren't that great. They let in a lot of light around the nose, they feel really stiff and they feel HUGE on my face, not heavy, but huge. I am still looking for something that beats my Bucky 40 Winks, which I am not wholly happy with . . ."
2,NIGHTMARES!,"I should say, if I slept on my back this would get 3 stars...I give it 2 because light still creeps in through the nose area, due to the obnoxious padding around the eyes...the padding is NOT soft...just fiber fill...NOT SOFT! SIDE SLEEPERS BE WARNED!! your head can't even make contact with your pillow if you sleep on your side...I was shocked really...I tried it twice and I think my dogs turned it into a chew toy...FINE WITH ME!"
5,Dream Essentials Sleep Mask.,"Purchased as a gift and raved about effectivenessDream Essentials Escape Luxury Travel and Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Navy"
2,Over-priced and bulky,"Pros: If you sleep on your back, this is comfortable and the extra padding on either side of nose helps cut-down light. The strap is fastened on the side, and the velcro connection is not too thick to be uncomfortable when I sleep on my side. It has good eyelid clearance.Cons: When I sleep on my side the wide mask shifts, resulting in light coming in. It's also a bit bulky.Compared to other masks on the market, this is way over-priced."
3,Could be better.......,"Would be a much better product if it was comfortable sleeping on your side. This is my chief objection to it. Otherwise, it is pretty much as advertized. The band is also somewhat uncomfortable and for larger size heads it may be too tight."
4,Great color,Not as soft as I had hoped. Fast delivery. It does make night more like midnight! In all I will keep it.
4,Great at blocking light,The mask is a little bulky but totally shuts out all light. It is a decent value for the money.
5,Serenity Now!,This mask is delightful. i can now sleep at night without having my eyes opening and finding my cornea stuck to my pillow case. ahhhh what a nightmare that was. now I get pleasant sleeps and compliments from my wife stating i never looked better...;-) I highly recommend it.
3,"Quality item, comfort depends on your personal preference","I bought this for my mom as a gift. The quality of the item was high. Nice packaging, and includes the carry bag and ear plugs. Well made and will last a long time. I asked my mom for her opinion for the review, and she said to give it three stars and to say it's good for blocking out the light, but is a bit too heavy on the face. Would prefer it to be lighter in weight. She also said it can be uncomfortable when you are lying on your side or stomach. It is not necessarily a bad product - it depends on your sleeping habits/positions and personal preference."
2,"Too bulky, can't sleep on side","This was a lot bulkier than I had thought it would be. I am returning it. It would be great if you are a back-sleeper, but I sleep on my side, and it dug into the side of my head."
4,buying a second one,"I bought one of these last year. Actually, I bought three different models of sleep masks at the same time, in order to test them out. I liked this one so much that I am buying the very same model again this year. Why am I buying another one? Because one of my dogs ate the first one! I still have the other two masks of different models, but this one stands out above the others. Even though I was able to buy this mask at half price last year and have to pay full price for it this year, it's worth it!I am giving this mask 4 stars instead of 5, just because it **is** a bit warm on the face during hot weather. However, all the masks I've tried have the same problem. Despite other reviews on this product, I don't have any problems sleeping on my side with this mask -- and I LOVE the off-the-eye design. Overall, it's a great mask!"
4,milder,"milder than a lot of LPD stuff , but still in a class above almost any other musical adventure you have ever bought"
4,Great Puritan History,Read this book if you are studying the puritans. Great information that I did not find in other books.
2,poor story,"this issue was kind of bland.grundy was lame and unrecogniseble ,also batman had the worst outting ever so pitiful and short areal peice of crap by main stream standards.shamefull."
4,great grater,"i like to use this for small amounts, like just putting a little cheese on some salad or chili. it cleans up well, much faster than any four-sided grater i have. i would have given five stars if it was made in the u.s.a."
5,"Classic Kung Fu, a MUST for any true fan.","This DVD is one of the best Kunf Fu flicks around. If you only own 2 Gorden Liu DVDs, it should be this one and Master Killer.This film is a pleasure to watch from start to finish, having superb action, a good story, great costumes, and women who can fight as well. Gorden Liu's superb skills show, especailly while he trains in the pond at Wu-Tang mountain.The costumes and sets give this film a higher visual standard, putting it a different arena than other old school Kung Fu films.The fights in this film are designed beautifully, filled with plenty of traditional kung fu, incredible staff(pole) handling, and a few wire tricks as well.There's even a fight where Gorden Liu takes on a dozen spearmen while his sister is tied to his back. Sounds almost hokey, but its done in a flawless fashion. The final battle is truly phenominal, but I don't want to give a way the ending...go see it for yourself, for the 14 bucks you'll spend, this one's a must buy."
5,Exceptionally Powerful (Dental Abuse!),"This is a truly unique film - breathtaking fight scenes and emotionally stirring acting. Within the cast, there is not a single weak link. In a genre where the priority has rarely been character development, this film shows that it is possible to combine this with action, without either suffering. Whislt this is not a remastered DVD, the price and the supprisingly `comedy-free` dubbing means that it is an essential film.Remember: Brush after every meal...."
3,not that great,"i was taken by an existing review which said that if you liked 36th chamber of shaolin you'll like this. but i beg to disagree. too much histrionics where not needed and too many silly looking fighting gadgets. also i'm averse to gaudy costumes which imo spoil the feel of the movie (same can be seen in 'kid with the golden arm', 'avenging eagle' etc). so though this movie might have good fights (imo even this is disputable) the mentioned negative factors tends to spoil the positives. and also those who are turned off by obviously fake sets and gaudy costumes, keep away."
2,Pole,Not a good movie. Not enough action. Same boring story line as in the other kung fu movies where someone takes revenge.
2,Boo!,This movie is way over the top. Although I do like old school Kung Fu movies...this one is terrible...Want classic check out the 36th Chamber of Shaolin and not this one. This one put me to sleep numerous times!
3,Great film shame about the dvd quality,"What can i say about this film apart from its a classic in every sense of the word if you want to see great martial arts look no further than this . I wont spoil you with plot details you will have to buy the dvd for this , this one stars gordon liu and the late fu sheng who also died half way through the film completion so if you are wondering why he suddenly vanishes halfway through the film - now you know why . Its such a shame that a classic film like this is spoilt by the poor transfer onto dvd , but if you can get past this (and for the price you should be able to - you are in for a treat )what more can i say for the price and the classic film to add to your collection you cant go far wrong."
3,ACTION/MARTIAL ACTS,"WELL, THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE. I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING MORE ACTION WITH THE GUY THAT STARS IN THIS MOVIE. I'LL BE LOOKING FOR MORE NEW MOVIES WITH THIS GUY STARRING IN THEM.THANK YOU!!!! HERB SIMON. KATY, TX."
3,"Great film, poor quality.","The first thing you should know is that Red Sun is a bootleg company. They steal the film's masters from its true owners and publish them on these discs. Red Sun discs come with essentially no bonus features, different audio tracks, or any bells or whistles.But since most of the true releases of these DVDs are fairly impossible to get your hands on, the Red Sun releases are usually worthwhile. The release of Invincible Pole Fighter, however, isn't worth your time. It's a very good kung fu flick with some of Gordon Liu's best work, but the audio quality is simply terrible. My suggestion is to try to find it at a video rental place or somewhere so you get to see it, but this disc isn't worth adding to your collection.Not to say Red Sun is terrible quality overall, most are fine. Return of the Master Killer, Five Deadly Venoms/Crippled Avengers, among others have the best quality picture and sound available...this one just didn't get it done."
3,"Very Good Flick, but don't believe the hype!!","This was a very good movie, but it is not the greatest shaw brothers film. Other SB films have had better story lines and Fight sequences. If you enjoy Gorden Liu then by all means purchase this film. The movie has a decent plot and very good action (especialy the final fight). You wont be mad that you have it in your collection."
4,Details down to the last thread,"This is a thinking mans movie. Keeps you on the tips of your brain stem. If you liked the TV series ""Mission Impossible"", because of the technical details, you'll love this movie. Reason is, the man that created those details for TV, also created the escape scenes in this movie. Everything is thought out and shown in major detail, except one. What is that one mistake? You won't hear a peep out of me!"
4,Cold suspense on DVD-R,"This obscure, Poe-esque revenge picture recalls some of the better Hammer horror in its excellent usage of gothic sets (and in this case, stark locations in Sweden and Denmark) and colorful character parts to create a rich and memorable, if minimalist, atmosphere of suspense. Max von Sydow as the 'innocent' institutionalized murderer and Trevor Howard as the skeptical detective make for formidable, stoical oppononents in a slow-paced (at 106 minutes) but rewarding chess game of wits. Note, however, that the VCI pressing I received (release date 2008) is a DVD-R, which may not be compatible with all players and is prone more readily to data loss than fully mastered DVDs; and although the package specs indicate a 'letterboxed' presentation (1.85:1 aspect ratio), the print appears to be fullscreen. Video quality is decent, audio somewhat variable (exacerbated by heavy overdubbing). Still, a worthwhile chiller in any format. 3 1/2 stars overall."
1,Not worth your time...,"As someone who picked this book up with a personal interest in the peace corps, I still found it utterly unreadable. The prose is flat and dull. This was Mr. Carter debut; let's hope that it was also his last book."
3,Impressive,"I thought this was an honest book, one that wasn't afraid to put forth a morally confused and complex main character, not a cardboard hero by any means. The descriptions of Tanzania were certainly vivid, and the eroticism was palpable. My only complaint is with the title, which is flat and generic and doesn't do the book justice."
4,southern girl,"i like this shoe but i had to send it back and reorder my sz which is a 8, it runs true to sz"
1,Complete rip off of The Science of Getting Rich,"This book was a huge disappointment. I tried reading it but couldn't finish it because I was so appalled that this author stole 90% of his content from Wallace Wattle's The Science of Getting Rich (written in 1910). I have read Wallace Wattle's book over 10 times so I have most of it memorized. Immediately I realized that he was using wallace wattle's book, most of it being verbatim and in the same order. Plagarism at its worst. You're better off reading The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace Wattles which is much better and not from a shady author."
4,Wisdom & Good Guidance,"Another great title in this great metaphysician's valuable body of work. All the well-known laws of prosperity are covered in the author's engaging style, followed by the familiar testimonies of various people's experiences. Useful affirmations and information on visualisation are provided in Murphy's inimitable style. I admire the simplicity of his writing and his talent for clearly explaining the laws of mind. His non-dogmatic view of ""tithing,"" which he explains as giving with love, is not about only money and especially not about percentages, but about cultivating the right spirit of giving in all areas of your life. There are numerous quotes from people like Emerson, Gibran, Longfellow and from the Bible. Fortunately, Murphy's interpretation of these biblical statements make sense in the light of psychology. A highly recommended work of wisdom and good guidance."
5,This book can change your life and save your relationship!,"This book was written in the early sixties before the complicated mumbo-jumbo of self-help materials was invented. Clear , concise, doable steps to seeing that all you are and will ever be is already inside you. And that's a lot!!"
2,Not Impressed,"For my team we all ordered these socks. I found the only good thing about them is that they have an Under Armour logo. wearing them is a totally different story. They are uncomfortable and thin. They cause feet to sweat even before any physical activity. In a 30F game my feet still sweat. After you sweat in them they will just get slippery and cause one to slide in the cleat, loosing speed and agility."
2,thick socks,"these socks are hot, not exactly comfortable for work in combination with tennis shoes.Your feet will likely sweat. Im going to go back to clima-cool."
5,Great sport sock,"Needed this sock for football, great sock,my son plays on turf fields which can get hot this sock help protect his feet from the heat."
2,ua all sport sock,"These socks aren't as good as my other ua products. I wear a size 10 in men's shoes and have narrow feet. In all my other ua socks, I wear a lg. The toe box area in these socks is too loose and the material isn't as comfortable as ua normally is. My calves are med sized, and the top of the sock is too tight and doesn't expand that much. Overall, subpar (by ua standards) product. Would buy again at a clearance price. The seller on the other hand was good. Fast shipment and great updates. Thanks again amazon for a very good buying experience."
3,"Overpriced logo socks, thin and tight","I bought these socks for our teenaged son, who plays baseball. Of course Under Armour is wildly popular right now, and he wanted these because of that fact.However, the socks are thin synthetic material and fit somewhat tight on his average sized leg, and they made his feet sweat. I also thought they were overpriced for the quality. We liked the Mizuno Performance Solid Color Sport Socks better for the same price, although the ""stylish"" logo isn't easily visible while wearing them."
5,Great UA Sock,"In the past, I have not had much luck with straight socks. When I ordered this sock, I did not realise that it had that shape. However, since I tried them for the first time, I have not used any other sock since then. Soft,""cushy"" and fitting very well at the calve, I enjoy training in them!"
2,Not Satisfied,I ORDERED NAVY SOCKS AND GOT WHITE SOCKS... MY HUSBAND NEEDED THESE SOCKS FOR HIS FOOTBALL GAME AND THIS IS WHAT HE RECIEVED. THANKS
4,Nice lightweight sock,I like the fitted socks better (the ones with a bend for the ankle) hence the 4 stars. But this has been a great sock to wear in the summer under work boots.
2,slippery,"these were (just) ok, although socks are socks... these socks are very slick on the outside. If you are at a higher level of competition and make hard cuts, these will give you blisters even if your soccer boots are well broken in. I gave them 5 good washes after the initial use, and then used them again, and still I got blisters.... I don't get blisters with other brands (in the same shoes), sorry under armour I won't buy your soccer products again!!!!"
5,What a great CD!,"I don't really have anything brilliant to say about this one except that I really really really like it. *grin* Chris Rice reminds me of Rich Mullins in the honesty, humility, and passion he displays in his music, yet his songs are light-hearted and fun, too. This is his best CD. The title song is one of my very favourite songs."
5,If there were only more poets like Chris Rice in the world!!,"Beautiful and inspiring are the 2 words that come to me when I think of this album. I praise God that though He took one poet to Himself, Rich Mullins, He has given us another to fill our souls with more of Him."
5,"simply the most honest, uplifting christian music I've heard",Each song on this CD will find a place in your heart and soul. Rice's ability to take everyday Christian observations and translate them into words and song is remarkable. This CD opens an additional avenue for praising God. The honesty of the lyrics and the subsequent Hope in Christ that he exudes is contagious.
5,it is very emotional,it is a very emotional album filled with praise and testimonies that are sure to touch anyone's heart.
5,I could hear a anglic choir!,"Just to think that God has been directing lives, from the begining and in a broken world to. All I can say what a job he has, and all I can say thank youJesus for saving me, from my self. For it takes a GOD to do just that.WHAT A AWASOME GOD WE HAVE!!!!"
4,It did happen,"The point of the movie, is to point out, that all that amazing stuff REALLY DID HAPPEN. The Warsaw ghetto uprising did happen like that, that's why it was so amazing. A bunch of teenagers (Mordechai Aneilewicz was only 24 at the time) managed to hold off the most powerful army in the world for longer then Poland and France did. It was a turely amazing feat, and it DID HAPPEN. Nothing, in regards to the actual fighting was over exagerated. If you have seen the documentaries on the DVD, or, if like myself you have spoken to people like Kazik or Marek Edelman, you would know that this is all true.The only problem is a few details concerning the Bund. Other then that, it was about time a movie came about, that showed the world that the Jews DID fight back."
5,Can't belive more Jew's did not fight back.,This is a true story or as true as can be told today. If you know nothing of how bad it was this will give you a glimpse into the world of those fun-loving Nazi's who spread death every where they went. That sounds like our last 8 years---- only we will take all your oil too!!!!!
1,SKIP IT and watch PIANIST instead.,"I think people are reviewing the heroism and the story itself and yes that deserves 5 stars...but this pathetic Hollywod fairy tale of a potrayal does not. Please do confuse the two. Let me summarize it for you...enter noble hero, a handsome bunch of jewish fighters, add comic relief, jew-hating pole with a bottle of vodka in his hand (I'm not kidding) and top it off, all evil but not so bright nazis. I guess can't expect too much from network TV. Trust me, this would have never come out of HBO, NEVER.Anyway, if you like dumbed down stories, here is one for you. For the rest of us adults, who may prefer, more complex characters and not so black n white story delivery, I recommend Pianist. Based on book by ghetto survivor and directed by a ghetto survivor. Plus it has superb acting from Adrian Brody... David Schwimmer is just doing Friends minus the comedy (if there was any comedy in friends)."
2,More than unrealistic!,"This movie is posibly a creation of a Rambo fan. You can see thirty untrained Jewes killing with their bare hands hundreds of German SS soldiers, which we all know were the elite of the German Army, trained to kill and survive. The most disturbing part ofcourse is the casting. Hank Azaria and David Schwimmer alias Terminator and James Bond? I rest my case!"
2,Good story that didn't capture the horror!,"Although i find this story to be of historical fact--- it played out to clean and hollywoodish. The horror of this event in todays video revolution, does no where close to showing the down right dasderdley event of starving the jews into getting on the trains for transport to the death camps. Amazing how everybody looks fit as a fiddle,washed and clean.When dead people were being striped and left in the street for burial!!!! People were dying in this place every day---a lack of realism deturs from getting to excited over this video! Even though this story needs to be told, there r better movies to get a full understanding of the plight of the jews in warsaw!!"
5,Courage at its best,"This is probably the most powerful movie I have seen in a while. It centers on the Warsaw ghetto uprising. This is a story of courage; of people who had nothing, but were willing to give up everything. The cast was wonderful, and provides outstanding commentary as a special feature. See this film!!"
2,Hollywood saccharine,"This movie reduces an heroic true story to a cliche filled hollywood one dimensional action movie that lacks credibilty. Actors and I use the term lightly for some of them,chew up the scenery.The kind of script an eleven year old writes as they fantasise about being a hero. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Important story adequately told.,"A fine, if too well feed cast, did a good job portraying the suffering and resistance in the Warsaw ghetto. I would have liked a little less focus on the Germans Hipler and Stroop and more attention paid to the diversity of political thought among Polish Jews. I found the line wondering why the allies did not bomb Eastern Poland to disrupt the Holocaust a little disingenuous. In spring 1943, the Western Allies were in Britain and the Russians were preparing the defense of their recaptured Kursk; there were no aircraft that could make the round trip. Even in late summer of 1944 when the Western Allies wanted to drop supplies to the those fighting in the other tragic uprising in Warsaw, it was not possible since the Russians refused to allow the pilots to land in the territories they had captured in their sweeping 1944 summer offensive. In wars there are always mistakes and missed opportunities but the Allies were fighting as fast as they could and at great cost."
3,Great except for anti- Polish sentiments,"I noticed another reviewer picked up on some of the historical inaccuracies of the film,please no ""sins of omission"",there was aPolish underground that eagerly fought alongside the Jews in Warsaw.There is no need to over-dramatise this part of history as it is painfully dramatic enough,I'm not of Polish descent but would be offended if I were,otherwise a captivating & well made film.Would've gotten 5 stars if not for deliberate over dramatization of certain scenes & glaring non-mention of the Polish underground which fought equally brave against the WaffenSS & Wermacht units.Check out ""Warsaw Rising"",if you can find a copy,Ballantine Books,for a historically accurate perspective on this subject."
3,Not my favorite,"I prefer the New Mexico Atlas and Gazetteer over the Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas. The reason is that the gazetteer shows state and federal lands - places where I'm not tresspassing. That's important to me. I carry them both, but the gazetteer gets used much more."
3,Not enough detail.,"If comparing this to the DeLorme atlas for New Mexico--the only competition--the big difference is that the Benchmark atlas has a coarser scale and less detail. You can get a good sense of this simply by looking at the back cover: DeLorme divides the state among 45 pages of maps, Benchmark gives it 29, and it simply isn't possible to fit the same amount of detail in 2/3 the space. Instead Benchmark gives you partially redundant recreation maps and landscape maps; I'd much rather just have a single set of maps with more detail and all the information right there. This is not to suggest the DeLorme atlas is perfect; it certainly isn't. But it is the best game in town."
1,not that great,"according to my child, 9 years, the game is not very interactive - more like watching short film clips."
3,Lack of directions,"This game is bright, colorful and I can tell it's supposed to be fun but I have had issues with a lack of directions. There are many games to be played on this CD set but one cannot play more than 2 games before (unlocking) and moving forward to the other games on the CD. This seems quite strange and frustrating for me and my 7 year old. I wish I could figure out why?? Also, it is brand new for Christmas and we have played it about 5 times, twice already we have had to restart due to Charlie getting ""stuck"" in the game and not being able to move him anymore. Don't know if mine has ""bugs"" or if the game in general is lacking."
4,Great for children - Very good graphics,This game is a puzzle-oriented game but allows children to explore and grab lots of candy. My son loves it and I would recommend it.
3,Very good but marred by its own Orientalisms,"Hardy decries Orientalist attitudes but, nevertheless, uses the Aryan invasion model to explain the nature of Indian religious culture. Hardy is obviously not familiar with the recent archaeological findings in the field which assert that the cultural development in India is indigenous. In fact the Harappan iconography provides us scenes of the Goddess slaying the buffalo-demon, etc. It is a pity that the Sanskritists have not kept pace with findings in archaeology and history of science."
2,"Umm,Its very different and theres nekkid wimmen...","Silly,Very silly film about two unlike species of hybrid creatures fighting each other over a human woman.Have to believe there some tongues in cheeks during the making of this non-epic.There is some lovely victims of the female stereotypes, In varying stages of undress and shapes and sizes,hair color and height.So,GET very drunk and have faint memories of all the PIRANHA movies you love and all the WEREWOLF movies you consumed and realize this isn't one of those,But try to enjoy anyway.Larry Buchanan must be smiling in his grave,The Torch has passed on...."
3,Good movie night fun,Being a huge fan of all the old creature feature flicks I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. This is a campy send up that is definitely good for some laughs. I would have love to seen this at my local drive in back in the day.
1,Broke the first time we tried it!,"My kids and I love a good puzzle. However, this was a real disappointment since it broke the very first time we tried to do it. Luckily, it was Christmas morning, so we had lots of other things to play with, but still..."
3,Disappointingly mishandled,"Having seen rudimentary translations of the anime and manga of this series, I was excited to hear that ADV would be releasing both the anime and manga. Unfortunately, the manga is marred by ""Americanizations"" that change the humor and in a few cases completely change the original intent. I won't bore you with technical details, but some examples: the character ""Osaka"" is given a Brooklyn accent, English teachers become Spanish teachers, foods are given different names and a few jokes dealing with Japanese culture are completely rewritten, changing the meaning entirely.The question is why does ADV bother to print the manga from right to left and display Japanese sound effects if they are going to make so many drastic changes?Luckilly, there is some hope. The second half of this volume is closer to the original intent and meaning, leaving me to hope that the subsequent volumes will be of this quality."
5,Absolutely hilarious.,"This has got to be the wackiest thing I've ever read. It's about a group of girls: Chiyo, a 10-year-old genius; Osaka, a total airhead; Sakaki, a girl who secretly likes Hello Kitty type things; Yomi, a compulsive dieter; Tomo, a hyperactive lunatic; and all their other friends and wacky teachers.This is an awesome book, filled with all the cute, strange, and totally bizarre humor anyone could ask for. As my friend lovingly said: ""It's like Peanuts on crack!"". The art is nohing really remarkable, but it's not bad, either. After all, it's a four-panel newspaper type comic.(...)"
4,"very strange, but good","This is a manga composed mainly of vertical comic strips that follow the Japanese right-to-left format. For a first-timer with this kind of format, this manga may be difficult to handle, since the publishers didn't put any kind of explanation of the format anywhere in the book. Basically, this manga follows the school life of a few teachers and their students. Just about everyone is a little strange, it seems. There's Miss Yukari, who is somehow a teacher in spite of the fact that she's more immature than some of her students, Chiyo-chan, the ten year old genius, and Sakaki, the girl who secretly loves animals and other cute things, just to name a few. I kept getting some of the characters confused, but I really enjoyed reading this."
4,Totally unserious and lots of fun,"This is the traditional sort of lighthearted manga, involving a group of high school girls: Tomo, the abrasive loudmouth; Sakaki, tall and athletic and obsessed with kitty-cats; Kaorin, who has the hots for Sakaki; ""Osaka,"" because that's where she's from (think Brooklyn accent); Yomi, smart but can't sing worth a damn; Chiyo-Chan, the ten-year-old prodigy; and, of course, the slightly pathological Miss Yukari, the first-year teacher, who often is less mature than her students. The humor is often sly, frequently ditzy (so what *does* the ""ho"" mean in ""Heave-ho""?), but sometimes a little oblique (which means I didn't always get the joke). Azuma does it as a series of four-panel strips, like a daily comic, so you can dip in almost anywhere."
5,A recording full of Prokofiev's wit and energy,"While von Karajan was an excellent conductor with the German repetoire of Beethoven, Brahms, ect, it was often with works from of non-German composers that he made his best performances. This CD of Prokofiev's two most popular symphonies is no exception. While the ""Classical"" symphony does seem a bit heavy for a work meant to be written in the spirit of Haydn, the reading of the fifth is wonderful and I've yet to hear a better recording of it. The tension of of the first and third movements contrasts wonderfully with the light hearted moods of the second and final movements. I highly recommend this performance."
4,Prokofiev 1 & 5,"Prokofiev's best symphonies are 1 & 5. You rarely see any other Prokofiev symphonies performed. The first symphony is called the ""Classic"" because it resembles a Haydn symphony with 20th century instruments. Prokofiev completed it in 1917. By contrast, the 5th symphony was written near the end of World War Two. Karajan's version of the 5th is from 1968 when he and the Berlin orchestra were at the height of their powers. The first symphony was performed later in 1981. The Berlin orchestra under Karajan's direction gives a great feel to both symphonies and I wanted to get it before it disappears from the catalog."
4,"Good fit for a 2 man tree stand, but need to air it out!",I opened this package up in my new 2 man tree stand and it smells to high heaven.No wonder I didn't see any deer the 2 days I was in the stand. You definately need to wash this before use or air it out in the rain for a few weeks. I left my up and hopefully the smell will be gone by next hunting season. The string ties were good as it easily attached to my stand in two pieces. Photo matches what you get and is a good burlap camo blend.
3,ok but expected more,"it will serve the purpose for which it was made but it is basically a peace of camo burlap with strings tied on to it, i will use it and it should work but if i would have known that this was all that was included i would have saved my money and would have bought some blind material and made my own."
3,Good Remixes,"These are definitly good mixes of Boys Of Summer however I feel the original DJ Sammy version is pretty good on it's own,,,worth having if you like this song."
4,Great Book,"I am an amateur at the art of mixology and this book has some great recipes for folks like me. Also because I don't drink, I appreciate the book's focus being on the drink itself and not on alcohol. It has a a little box on the bottom of add-ons for those who want to ""kick it up a notch""."
2,Returned!,"I was very disappointed when I received this book... not worth the $10. Maybe in the 80-90's this book would have been good within its kind.. but really it is so short and simple. Only a few recipes, no illustrations, no fun! If you want a book to make fun drinks I recommend you look for something else. I returned it and got another one!"
2,Too much work!,"This book was not helpful to me at all. While I expected a little work, I didnt expect to be the Emeril of Frozen drinks while making them. The recipes are very complicated and many of them do NOT have listed how to put alcohol in them. So, if you want to spend tons of time making a drink and you do not drink alcohol, this book will be perfect for you. Mine is now just a book I sat out when I had a frozen drink party!"
5,Simplehuman Steel Trashcan,"A Little High priced, but is built very good. I bought it for my daughter for Christmas, and it looks very nice in her kitchen. I like the idea that it has a liner."
4,Minimal breakable parts,"What I hate about other trash cans, is that the step eventually breaks, or the automatic sensor breaks, or it's ALL plastic and looks gross, which means you usually throw it away, creating a large amount of waste. I don't foresee this swing arm breaking, so it seems like I will be able to use this for a long long time. The only drawback is that once the trash gets to a certain level, you can swing the top anymore, it's get stuck."
5,Awsome,Not only are the trash can great they are very well made and sturdy. Plus they were shipped to Alaska in only a few days!!! I will be back to buy more . Thanks
4,does the job,"We wanted a trash can with a swing top lid. We had difficulty finding any that fit with our decor. The stainless steel looks institutional, but at least it isn't plastic. The can works well. It is easy to keep clean. This is recommended until someone comes up with a quality product that doesn't look so institutional."
4,This Is Not a Toy,"First - and most important - this is not a toy kit. It is the scenery to be used with the River Pass model railway layout (which is also sold by Woodland Scenics)and takes a high degree of skill to use. I am still in the process of adding the scenery to my layout, but (so far) I am pleased. If you're an advanced modeler (or want to be) it's a great kit, containing most of what you'll need to give your layout an authentic look. However, if you're a kid - or a beginner - you'll come away frustrated."
2,All The Weight Drops to the Bottom,"Be aware that this is a heavy garment. I am an active, 47 yrs. old, female 5'10"" 165 lbs. I found the vest too heavy and uncomfortable. It is also a large garment. This will not fit into a small microwave. You will need a full size microwave to warm this vest.On my vest, the horizontal seams across the vest were open at the edges and not sewn shut. As a result the herbs did not stay distributed throughout the vest. Instead they fell to the sides and down to the bottom of the vest. Turning the vest into a bottom heavy sandbag that fell off my shoulders. This could be remedied if the manufacturer evenly distributed herbs throughout the vest and then properly closed the horizontally seams. Perhaps if the herbs were properly distributed the vest may have not been so uncomfortable. I wouldn't hazard a guess.The pros were that the vest went far down to the middle of my back. The velure fabric was soft and the herbs smelled nice."
3,Informing but Very Repetitive,"I has to read this book for my Integrative Studies class at Michigan State. I was enlightened on the subject of urban housing and the women who lived and worked in them. Toward the middle end, the book got very repetitive and it dragged along. This was ok. The Author could have done a better job."
5,A great extension of pilates mat work,"I never give reviews but am so in love with this book and my my new magic circle (bought seperately) that I was compelled to share. Her directions and pictures are easy to follow. She gives accessible and useful explanations of the pilates principles and applies them quite successfully to the props. A lot of the exercises are based on the original pilates mat exercises and can be done without the props, but I found the magic circle really added a new dimension to the floor work. I have mostly just spent time with the magic circle section so far, but am looking forward to trying some of the roller exercises next."
3,Helpful,"This book is helpful in regards to adding props to your Pilates practice. I do not find it overly helpful, but it does offer ways to improve and enhance the workout. I have been using props for awhile, so it could just be that I am already familiar with a lot of the exercises."
2,a little disappointed with book,"I ordered this book and the description was used - good but when the book arrived it looked like someone had spilled black powder on the inside of the front cover, the index section was torn and covered in the black powder and pages 36 and 37 also have the black powder on them. The powder looks like the stuff in copiers. the cover to my review had no damage and the envelope the book arrived in was in good condition."
4,satisfide costumer,I have check this cd out more then once & its an ok cd. cheesy remake versions of halloween songs. fast shipping & arrived in good condition. desent price.
4,Smaller than it looks.,"The clip is small and holds my PDA close and tight. The clip is pretty strong, too. Exactly what I was looking for."
4,Good Health,"Been taking CoQ10 100mg for a month now, and they are good. Doctor put me in them in hope of helping me through my ovulation period."
4,"Good system, not the fastest","My dad bought me this system for school work and for surfing the web. Works great for that. Of course I like to game, and it was okay but not great at that. So I ended up buying my own video card and a 2nd hard drive.By the way the other reviewer is nuts, because I upgraded mine with the stuff he says you can use in about 30 minutes. Everything worked fine and it was all just the cheapest thing they had in the store. And while I didn't upgrade the ram I looked and there is a free slot, standard size for DDR-Ram."
1,dull stories better left in the drawer.,"With a possible exception of the second one, all the stories in this book lack narrative energy. the characters are dull and single-dimensioned, and the plot ,if detectable, suffers from a lack of any creativity. Do not buy this book."
3,Provocative but falls short,"The Elementary Particles is an unflinching vivisection of human frailty and absurdity that is, at times, engaging and laugh-out loud funny but is often predictable and unfulfilling, particularly as the characters crawl toward their loathsome and inevitable annihilation.Fans of Chuck Palahniuk will delight in Houellebecq's acerbity. Those less enchanted by the brutal honesty may at least be impressed by the manner in which it is brought forth, particularly in the several delightful passages that juxtapose ivory tower academic theory with tragicomic human folly.Being someone who has a low tolerance for works that deal largely with the exposition of emotional, sexual, and ultimately human dysfunction, I can't give this more than 3 stars, but I did manage to get through the book quickly on account of its entertaining style."
4,Nothing bad to say about this one,"Michel Houellebecq has written a book that some may find utterly distasteful and others stimulative. I'm in the second group. Half-brothers Bruno and Michel appear to be as different as their fathers, but the essence of their mother runs through them both and I see them being more alike than not. I don't love either character but adore the way they were created and developed. I read a 2000 translation by Frank Wynne for Vintage International and since I speak no French, this will have to suffice. If you're looking for an upbeat and cheery novel, skip this, but if you wish exposure to characters you'd not necessarily care to know in person, give this a whirl. I must now read more by Houellebecq."
3,Naught provoking,"A so-so read, but not as wacked or interesting as I had hoped. From all the humbug I thought this book might set my pants on fire, but instead it was rather blah. Consider checking it out at the library first."
1,Idea of book: Good. Translation: Sloppy and crude,"The translation of the book is done very poorly. There are sentences that don't make sense in the English language that may in French. Or, I'm guessing, they are errors in the translation. There are the use of French terms with slips into American colloquialisms. E.g., calling a psychiatrist an ""analyst"" in one sentence, then a ""shrink"" in another.I think the basic idea of the book came across, but the translation was terrible. It was awkward and jumpy, which really detracted from the storyline. I'm going to buy the French version of the book and put it through the babelfish translator and I'm sure I'll understand this story more than the current translation."
1,Pure drivel,"This book is juvenile nonsense disguised as a ""challenging"" work. The author seems to have attempted to cram into the plot whatever he has researched on the subject of religion, philosophy and physics and has wound it together with a disjointed and extremely dull litany of sexual encounters. The book describes the misadventures of two half-formed characters, each of whom elicits no sympathy or interest from the reader. And to top it off, the novel finishes with an absurd sort of science fiction. It really is awful. I only finished it to find out what all the fuss is about and am still surprised that others were so easily duped into believing that this is important literature. Finally, it's also not hilarious as others have said - just desperate."
2,Must have been mildly interesting,"I know I read this book, but I can't remember a thing about it besides the fact that I finished it. That means that I must have found it at least mildly interesting, but obviously fairly unmemorable. I remember brothers and one of them is a genius and the other is an overgrown party boy. Maybe. I had a lot of ""edgy"" friends who talked up Houllebecq as their favorite author, so ballsy, intellectual, put-it-all-out-there. I clearly did not come away as impressed with his work. (Also, I didn't know that this is the same book as ""Atomized"", which I also bought.)"
4,A Bizarre Book,This is one of the weirdest and most unsettling books I have ever read.Some people will find it highly offensive while others may love its sexualcandour. I liked reading this book but there was one plot line whichreally scared and disturbed me. I could not read this book again.Once was enough. I found the ending to be ridiculous and absolutelyoff the wall.John
2,Even misanthropy can be meretricious--,"and boy is it a tiresome slog through a bunch of familiar Euro-middlebrow posturing. Tons of depressing sex, which may have embarrassed some reviewers into pretending there's something important going on."
4,Thought-provoking reflections on modern society,"I don't often read fiction, but as this novel is partially about science (I am a science graduate student) I decided to give it a try. This was the first novel I read that discussed current trends in science and also contemplated its future impact on society.The overall tone is quite cynical; none of the main characters have any particularly endearing qualities. Despite this overall tone, I found myself laughing at many of the author's satirical and philosophical insights.The book is filled with many graphic portrayals of gratuitous sex, but Houellebecq uses these scenes to comment on how the sexual revolution may have distanced us from forming intimate relationships instead of the other way around.I recommend this novel to anyone interested in existential philosophy and science. You may find yourself interested in the works of the many scientists, philosophers and literary figures mentioned throughout the book."
3,this book depressed me - big time,This book is important in that it can have a lingering effect on you. But be warned your head may be swimming for a while. I have been so depressed and frustrated with myself since i read this book 2 or 3 weeks ago. The upside is I started running - so maybe in a round about way it might have had a good influence on me.
1,A trashy book about trashy people...,"...written in trashy prose by a trashy excuse for a human being. The author might have had better luck getting his point across by standing on a street corner, railing about how much he hates women. At least, we would not have been left with this empty shell of a book. I really find it ironic that a book supposedly about the meaninglessness of modern society would be so trite and soulless. I would laugh but for the potential this so-called author MAY WELL DO IT AGAIN. And that, my friends, would be worse for the human race than any point he attempted to make.Short version: better used as kindling. Do not buy. Do not read."
3,Lost a little in translation.,"Read this on the plane and it's a pretty good airplane read however he makes some compelling points about where humanity is headed akin to the movie A.I. and at the end I couldn't help but feel that it was much ado about nothing, however how much of that was lost in the translation from the original French is hard to tell. Translated in the UK as ' Atomised' for some reason. Good for planes, trains etc."
4,need for love,"Read the book in a couple of days, struggled to understand philosophical parts but towards the end, it just hit me!I'm going to quote Houellebecq himself:""La tendresse est antérieure à la séduction; c'est pourquoi il est si difficile de désespérer.""Eventually, that's what this book teaches us. Wonderful read. Confusing at times but very honest and very revealing."
5,Not only a misanthrope's wet-dream-,"but also an engrossing, deft, (and most-importantly) WELL-WRITTEN book! The way Michel can slide so easily from character description to his sundry ruminations on humanity- he handles his ideas exceptionally well, whether you care for them or not. Also, this book is incredibly sad. I keep seeing people say how dark it is, but their is a vast amount of pathos in this to keep the spite alive.Rarely do i find books that are hard to put down, just my sensibilities. I loved this and truly did not want to part with the pages. 5 stars easily!"
2,Not much science fiction here,"I was not too impressed by this book, which has two separate parts. One is a very short science fiction idea (the last 30 pages), and the other is mostly a detailed family history.The family history portion is very French. The male characters are not very likable, and the women are very sexy. Some of the men are obsessed with sex.I can't recommend this book. I kept reading it, waiting for the science fiction payoff. When it did arrive at the very end of the book, I was underwhelmed."
2,romantic tragedy,"If you are looking to expand your nihilistic world-view or knowledge of the same philosophy, look elsewhere. Same stuff mentioned in my ""Whatever"" review applies (plot summary: some people are in perpetual state of angst and boredom), plus author doesn't even like the superior species superseding humans. Come on!"
4,"The peak performance from ""the other band""","""The other band"" sounds a lot tighter than they did on Saturday Night Live (although I thought it would be more challenging for Bruce to keep that lineup and revamp his music for a 5 piece band) or The Dress Rehearsal radio broadcast.My personal highlight is the performance of ""Atlantic City"", which just sounds better to me than the E Street Band's performance of the song.Another highlight for me is ""Lucky Town"". Some great guitar work from Bruce and Shayne."
4,You cant go wrong with the Boss!,Anyone who saw this tour wondered how Bruce would be without the E Street band. To my surprise they rocked the house down! If your a die hard Bruce fan you will love this album. Most of the songs you wont hear at a Bruce show since most songs are from Lucky Town and Human Touch. This version of Atlanic City may be this best song on this album. Great value!
4,Boss Live,Great versions of Darkness and Atlantic City. Light of Day which was a real rocker from the most recent tour. I bought this a few years ago and have rediscovered it. Definitely a keeper for Bruce fans who want the energy of a live performance.
3,Disappointing,"Good fun but it doesn't really have the long-term interest that Bruce's other albums have for me.A bit of a let-down, although Light of Day is fabulous."
2,You'll miss the E Street Band,"I bought this CD mainly for the duet version of Thunder Road that was done by Bruce and Roy. I also like the solo effort on ""Red Headed Woman"" Bruce had better had been singing to Patty with that song!The rest of the album makes you long for Bruce to rejoin with the E Streeters. The back up band pales in comparison and just don't have the same level of emotion or power that is necessary to turn this into what it should've been."
2,Why?,"It was funny to have him stand up after one song, plug in the instruments, and ""rock out"" - but in the long run it only made the performance and this album utterly pointless. An Unplugged session might have been interesting! But instead he just turned it into an average show, hindered by the intimate setting which kind of prevented them from truely 'rocking out'.Go with his other live albums, which are far superior."
4,Quite good,"I grew up listening to Bruce's music, official and bootlegged, so much it's part of my DNA. I like Bruce, though not as feverently as my siblings. Reading what I've read, and hearing what I'm hearing for the first time, I think the Plugged cd is quite good. Older songs are refreshed, newer songs, dripping with energy. I know how good the E Street Band are, believe me, but this band he was playing with enabled Bruce to do something different, and perhaps to do something basically for himself. I think he succeeded in a big way. A chance to play with other people and reinterpret his catalog. Dylan does it all the time, and everyone knows about the history of comparison between those two. Regretfully the 'fans' couldn't accept the change."
3,Not his best .........,"In my humble opinion I feel that this band of session players don't quite have the feel for the Boss's music.As they say,""it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing"". And the E Streeters certainly don't lack swing, or rock, or latin, or anything. They just play with their souls man!And what's with the bass player popping notes. I mean, Really????Have a look at Live in NYC or London Calling, Live in Hyde Park and you'll know what I mean."
2,Big dissapointment...,"I'm not a person who feeds upon nostalgy. I'm not an E-Street Band unconditional fan either. But, listening to this album, anyone can clearly conclude that these new band that Burce put togehter simply is not the right band for him.Jesus, just compare it to the recent LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY and you'll be astonished by the difference in terms of passion, power and musical ability.Anyway, Bruce had the courage to try something radically different, but it did not work out"
2,I just don't know,"I bought this book hoping to expand my knowledge about the use of blood in magickal and religious ceremony. I can't tell if I'm dissapointed because I already have more experiential knowledge of the topic than what is presented here, the author's lack thereof or the cursory and poorly researched nature of the book (more like a pamphlet). ""Seth"" could have dug much deeper into what is most definately an untapped goldmine of occult lore, but he's barely scratched the surface. Maybe it could be a lead in for the inexperienced, but I just don't know..."
1,The title of this book in my humble opinion is deceiving.,"The book's title is about Blood Magick, but the author doesn't really give us a practical aspect of how to use blood in magickal operations. I was very dissappointed. That is my humble opinion."
2,There are only 3 good songs!!,"This cd was a great disapointment!! I hate almost all of the songs on it accept; Miami, gettin' jiggy with it, and the men in black song. It is a waste of money!!"
3,ok.,"It only had a few songs which I liked wich are gettin' jiggy wit it, Miami, and Men In Black. So it was Ok."
2,To tell you the truth...,"I was a bit disappionted with this CD. I only like 4 songs on there; the tracks that are played one the radio. I love hip hop, but it is not my life. BUT!, if hip hop is your life then I wouldn't reccomend this CD to you. (Instead, I would reccomend Lauryn Hill's ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"". She has a VERY beautiful voice and a VERY great CD!) ""Big Willie Style"" lacks originality. The interludes are very piontless and very annoying. ""Miami"", ""Getting Jiggy With It"", ""Just The Two of Us"", and ""Men In Black"" are the only tracks worth listening to. Plus, Will is always saying he's all that and a block of cheese which REALLY gets annoying.Lauryn Hill and cheesy Doritos 4-eva!!-Candy aka Megan B.L., the Cheesenoodle"
5,This C.D. rocks!,This is the best rap I have ever heard(and I listen to a whole lot of rap)Whoever likes rap at all will love this. I listen to it for hours every day and never get tired of it. I think everybody should own this C.D. because it rocks!!!
1,PPPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE!!!!,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS CD JUST TO SEE WHAT ALL THE HYPE WAS ABOUT. THIS IS REALLY OVER RATED. WILL, STICK WITH ACTING AND LEAVE THE RAPPING TO REAL STARS LIKE, TUPAC, JAY Z AND BUSTA."
1,This is the worst CD Ever!,"Will Smith should seriously be embarrssed about this piece of work! He comes off very shallow and not talented in this supposingly"" great Album"". Great album? I think you should keep your money it's not worth it! Just listen to the radio for his 3 GOOD songs!"
2,Only Two good songs hence two stars,The only good songs are Gettin' Jiggy wit it and Miami he needs to be more like the Wutang Clan Wu-Tang Forever
3,Talk about narcissism!,"The majority of this CD's songs are cool, but Will Smith sings solely of egotism. I constantly heard the same basic phrase in every song ""I'm all this. I'm all that."" Fine. If he wants to think that way, what can the rest of us do to stop him? But it sure as hell ruins the CD's quality."
3,"It's good, but not the greatest","This CD is good, with cool songs, but I noticed that the songs all have the same basic beat, and therefore the songs aren't that different. I would recommend it though"
1,Poor,"This CD is BAD!!! Will is untalented, and wouldnt know an intellegent lyric if it bit him. buy busta rymes or 2pac instead"
4,Go Will!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We would give Will a 5 but we only like Miami and Gettin' Jiggy With It. It could be improved.But Will is so cute.
1,wuz up? FOOL!,Show me the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or no presentst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or I will flush you down the poddy!!!!!!!!!! I can figure out where you live!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Will Smith = OVERATED!!!!!,"I really dont know how Will Smith got so much credit for this cd.....jus tha other day i heard tha regular version of ""Just The Two of Us"" and all he changed was the lyrics and those are do predictable..anyone could make those lyrics up...second of all he says ""cut down on the swears"" i mean saying that in rap doesnt make sense, rap needs explicit words or cussing , what im trying to say is if your a true rap fan take this cd and smash it with a hammer, go buy some 2pac if want to hear real rap"
1,Not even close to rap,"Sure, I give him credit for rapping without profanity, but this guy is about as black as Vanilla Ice. I bought this CD after I heard Gettin Jiggy Wit It when it first came out and I thought he was the best rapper in the world. But then I started listening to artists like Tupac, Easy-E, Dr. Dre, Outkast, Twista, Three 6 Mafia, Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony, Master P, and Too $hort. Then I realized just how far from rap Will Smith is. This is a great album to buy if you're ten and easily influenced by gangsta rap or your parents won't let you buy anything else. If you're old enough to know better, go for any of the other above mention rappers and you'll be glad you didn't buy Big Willie Style."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY,"Since there isn't an option for no stars, guess I have to deal with one. I bought this cd figuring it'd be ok but to my surprise, it a piece of crud. Alright, he's famous actor and is good at what he does but his music is horrible. Due to hearing ""Men in Black"" and ""Getting Jiggy wit It"", I thought the album would be as good. To my dismay, it's just like all the rap music out there. Why can't rap artists come up with their own music instead of taking it from artists that actually came up with their own work. The album is on my cd rack collecting dust and I'm willing to to sell it for a penny. Wait, I'll just give it away for free."
2,Will's best CD overall.,"This was a pretty good cd from will, even though every track was a remake of some old song. The problem with this cd is the lyrics and the way he flows. I understand that he dosen't want to swear since he's trying to set an example for his son, But his flow has got to go. There are only a few songs like ""just the two of us"", ""getting jiggy wit it"",""maimi"" that really show some kind of flow. I think he was better back when he made ""summertime"" and ""Ring my bell"". Now his rhymes are kind of corny and need some edge so that he can get the real MC respect he deserves. he is an excellent actor , but his rapping needs tuning up. Overall this is a good CD if your not too heavy into rap. I really would rate this 2 1/2, but there is no rating button for that."
5,Will Smith has never been this talented.,"Will Smith has shown us that you can have good music without promoting gangs or ""mad dreams of a gangster"". I probably like him because he is so nice and not one of those sappy backstreet boys or another 5-boy group. I don't like people who lie like them. Uhh, Will smith kicks! Bye."
5,This CD is da bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This album is the emperor of all rap albums!!!! I play this CD almost every night!!!!!!!
5,will smith is so damn fine and his songs are the greatest.,"Will SMith is the best rappa and actor in the world. i love his latest release, ""Just the two uf us"". that song has the best lyrics in the world. yo, i love that song. if only i could meet him. yo, i best be out. peace and love, me"
5,This C-D is the best I've ever heard!,"I don't get it how anyone could give this masterpiece a two, like the one I saw, but the best songs are,........ they are all so good I can't say that any are better than any others."
1,YEAH RIGHT,"If this CD was any worse, I would set it in the middle of the street so someone could run over it. This was a highly anticipated, highly overrated album."
1,If I could I would give it half a star,This album is complete trash. Only white people and little kids are buying this album. How the hell could he get a grammy. Where I live nobody is bumping his album.
3,Buy the Tracks,"Big Willie Style contains three of Will Smith's greatest hits. We've heard them a million times, and quite frankly they have worn off their appeal. Now the downfall of the CD is not that the three best songs are over played, but that the rest of the CD is mediocre at best. To someone really dying to have the popular songs on this CD, I'd suggest legally download the few songs you want and save the rest of your money. I am a huge supporter or Will Smith and his clean lyrics, but I hope in the future he will put together a more complete album."
2,Not the best,"This album is rather poor,he was excellent in his days with DJ Jazzy Jeff.It was a bad mistake to leave him behind and pursue a solo career on this album.songs like Miami and Gettin Jiggy wit it bring this album up in the ranks.however candy is so POOR it brings it down sorry Will!"
1,WHAT IS THIS??????,"How many bought this over-rated CD??? Yeah, OK, Will Smith is a great actor but a REALLY bad rapper. How unoriginal can you get?!?!?! You could almost say that N'Sync is more original than Will Smith, and N'Sync AREN'T original. This is halfway bubblegum pop. Maybe I'm more of a NIN fan or a Nirvana fan than a Tupac fan or a Wu-Tang fan, but I can tell the difference between good and bad rapping."
5,Can y'all handle this,"1st of all I gotta say that I'm the biggest Will Smith fan ever. This CD is hot. Here let me give you a lil' detailY'all Know: 15/10 The flow is crazy, I about to perform this at the talent showGettin' Jiggy Wit It: 10/10 Makes you get up and danceCandy: 9/10 It's okay to me w/ one of da old school legend CameoChasing Forever: 5/10 Didn't like it that muchDon't Say Nothin': 10/10 Got a message to all u hatas. Ain't got nothin'nice to say don't say nothin'Miami: 10/10 Represent MIA fo' realYes Yes Y'all: 10/10 Catchy Hook good beatI Loved U: 8/10 It's aightIt's All Good: 9/10 Tight wit a lil' old school flavaJust The Two of Us: 10/10 Wonderful songBig Willie Style: 10/10 This song is the best. Left Eye be flowin'Men In Black: 20/10 This song is to good for a 10/10 have to give it more.So get up out your butt and get dis album."
1,Will Smith can't rap.,It's sad to see Will Smith getting all these awards because Will Smith can't rap. All that Will Smith does is talk. My mother is a better rapper then Will Smith because she raps not talks.
2,One song and that's it.,"The big problem with Will Smith is that he appeals to pop fans. I was personally suprised when Gettin Jiggy Wit It was nominated as Best Rap video, because I never considered it to be a rap video. Unlike a lot of rap it is just a real get out there and dance as fast in the most comical way you can dance kinda song. I originally bought it because I am a mood person, and listen to something depending what my mood is. Now what the problem with this CD is that every other song (other than Miami, and MIB) in it reminds me mildly of usher. I know other people do like that kinda stuff, but when you are a real pop fan, and a club hopper, you might want to stick with the single. On top of it all ""Just the Two of us"" is the heart warming song for those who are tired of symbolism. For me it is just too blunt. Copied right of the tape, and changed in the least creative method possible. It sounds like it only took 15 minutes to transfer."
3,Buy the single,"There are three good songs on the CD, and we have all heard them on the radio. Don't buy this CD if you are expecting the rest to be something more than just descent."
4,Will Smith is all about having fun!,"I have always loved Will Smith. He's an amazing actor, rap artist, and father. Unlike most artists today he has a very kicked back view on life. He's all about having fun and enjoying life. I especially loved his song ""Just the two of us"" which was dedicated to his son Trey. It shows how much he's matured from the fresh prince of belair. Much love and luck to ya Will. Keep up the good work! We all love you!With all my love, Anna"
1,"""Will Smith is meant to be seen and not heard""",Oh boy. Where do I begin with the critisism. Will Smith's album is nothing but a carbon copy of other ones before it. He obviously has no ideas of his own as far as lyrics go and the melody he creates for his songs are just as rediculous (if not more) as the tunes he conjured when he was the fresh prince. Hopefully he'll get a clue and start putting some real effort into his work rather than borrowing it from other artists.
5,Stop the Negativity.,"Peaple really do not appreciate good music, Will Smith is one of the few rappers that you can allow your kids listen to and still enjoy the Def Jams. Go out and buy the CD if you haven't."
1,"If I Could give it 0 stars, I would!","He had one decent song, ""just the 2 of us,"" ohter than that, the album was wack! stick to acting and leave rap to the real mc's."
1,Tha Godd Of Rap,"Wat up playaz?Will to tha Smizith is without a doubt tha best rappa in da world.Every song on Big Willie Style is original and very,very creativeMen In Black haz a very original beat and tune dat I have neva heard before until i listened to dis.Pick up this amazin record from tha Godd Of Rapp.I would have given this awesome album 3 starz,but theres too much dirty language.They should put a parental advisory sticka.But if u ignore da bad language,this album iz perfect 2 play on a hot sunny day.Peace from tha East."
2,No good!!,"Just download the 4 good songs, Men IN Black, Miami, Gettin Jiggy With It and Just the Two of Us because the rest is [not as good], sorry Will, your a good guy!!! Terrible album!!"
1,2 WORDS: RETIRE,"This album is a discrase to all true hip-hop fans. Will Smith defines the term ""Commercial Rapper."" This album is neck-a-neck with Vanilla Ice. He stole the term jiggy that Keith Murry had already been using for years. But unless you're a true rap fan, you wouldn't know that. Instead of Fresh Prince going into the rap hall of fame, Will Smith goes into the rap hall of shame!"
4,Will's got it going on!,"I was a little diappointed with Will's C.D. (Big Willie Style). There were 4 really good songs on the C.D. (Gettin Jiggy Wit It, Just the Two of Us, Men in Black, and Miami) but the rest of the songs were featuring other artists that (no offense) ruined the songs. Still, the overall C.D. was awesome! I love Will Smith to death and I will be looking to buy his C.D. soon! Luv ya'll! :)"
1,Bubble Gum Rap,"I am not hating on the guy. Will Smith is a very successful in the entertainment industry. But his rap style is really not to MY liking. I gave him a chance back in the day of ""Nightmare on My Street."" I liked him then, but I have ""grown"" out of his type of music and lyrics. I like him much better as an actor."
3,Not very good!,"This is not a very good c-d. The only songs I liked on this c-d where Getting Jiggy With It, Miami, Chasing Forever, and Men In Black. Just the Two of Us sounded really bad on the c-d. I was kinda disapointed with that. Also I hated the interludes. There's not much more to say about this c-d, except I would borrow this c-d from a friend before you try it, because I think this c-d sucks!"
1,this CD is one of the worst I've ever heard,"Will Smith makes his first pathetic attempt at rapping. He needs to stick to the acting, wait he can't do that either."
1,David Cook is the coolest guy alive! And you know it !,"Wiillie is back. Will Smith rapper turned actors returns to his roots. Will Smith the rapper who got his start rapping with DJ Jazzy Jeff in the late eighties rapping about his care free days days Philladpiha. Smith who last made an album three years ago. Returned to the studio to record Big Willie Style. The care free album is breath of fresh ffrom the cliqued, over glizted rap scence. ""Getting Jiggy with will be a great hit Smith. This album delivers. If you don't like rap you should here Will SMith's Big Willie Style and see if your mind is not changed. I give this album 3 boillion finger nails of a dog up. I also give Westerville North and journlism 1 4 billion of noses of a cat up."
4,Just a good time!,"A few dance/pop hits and nothing more here. Will Smith is entertaining, but nothing monumental."
1,I love Big Willie!,Here is a real man talking about real issues. Now drop the wife and let us party real big willie style! Party party Party. He doesn't have to swear becasue he is all about love. Keeping it real.
2,Listen to the radio for your fill of this one...,"While there's no questioning the fact that the tracks that have made it to radio are fun, due largely to the sampling of Sister Sledge and Patrice Rushen, this album wears pretty thin when given repeated listenings."
1,YUCK!,Anybody that likes Will Smith's music is OUT OF THEIR MIND! His music is TRASH! Half the time I can't even here what he's saying.Buy this CD if you like KoRn.
1,"To ""Aids vs, Cancer"": You're Pathetic........","I've read your reviews regarding a variety of bands from the 60s and 70s. Eric Clapton shouldn't play the blues? He's very highly regarded by guys like BB King and Buddy Guy. The Beatles suck? And yet you give five stars to a CD by Will Smith? Where have you been? ""I hate Baby Boomers...."" What a moronic mental midget you are, for certain."
1,overrated rap(crap) music,Will smith is one of the worst rappers ever.Anyways only retards and jerks listen to rap music these days.these so called musicians do not play any instruments.DONT LISTEN TO RAP MUSIC.Get any LED ZEPPELIN album instead.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
4,Good but needs some work,"It was an ok CD but the only good songs are ""Getting Jiggy Wit It"", ""Miami"", and ""Men In Black"" also ""Just the Two of Us"" that is if you like copied lyrics. They were good, but the rest, same, same, same. He would have made more if he sold them as singles. But the others are great hip hop new age dance party CD"
2,"""Not the greatest rapper in the world...""",Very poor album besides the popular singles. The whole production (set on a radio show) also lets it down. I was niave enough to buy this and have recently got rid of it *phew*.
2,Uhhh?,"Willie has 4 good songs on his CD. The others are dumb. I agree with the kid above, those 4 wont make up for the other 9 that aren't good. Good job, Will, on your other 4 songs!"
1,IT DESERVES NOTHING!,"Okay, Will Smith is no longer a rapper. He is now an actor; mabye he should stay with that. You can dance to the music, but isn't that the only reason people still buy Puff Daddy's music? If you want to hear real lyrics, pick up some Wu-Tang and pick up The ROOTS!"
1,POPCORN,i hate u will smith. your rap is popcorn and i feel sorry for jada who has to listen to u brag about your stupid rotten self all day. how could u win a grammy leave that to the real rappers
2,It's in the wrong category,"Don't get me wrong, I think Will Smith is a very skilled entertainer...just not a rapper. Will Smith is certainly a good role model...just not a rapper. I'm sure Will Smith is also a talented writer...just not a rapper.The bottom line is this; if you like pop music and want to feel like everything is hunky dory in the world, listen to Big Willy. But if you care to find out what the ""normal"" urban experience is, you must find it in ""rap music""...just not Willy!"
1,Bad,"This guy cant rap for his life! I can rap better, and i am a girl! Its surprising that he wins all those awards FOR NOTHING!"
2,MIB is only good song,"With the exception of ""Men in Black."" The rest of the songs are overplayed and unoriginal. True, MIB got it's fair share of air time, but I loved that song"
5,THIS IS A GREAT CD!,"I bought this CD before it even got famous. I loved it from the very beginning!! I was extremely shocked when some people started bashing it. Obviously, they don't know what good music is, because Will Smith has a great talent. How can anyone resist from dancing to his great music. All of the songs are great. Miami, Candy, Gettin Jiggy Wit It, and It's All Good are my all time faivorites. Even my dad likes his music and how often does it happen that parents like the same music as their children. Overall, if you haven't already bought htis CD, make sure that you do..... oh and buy it right now!"
5,AWESOME!,"Will Smith is soooooo cool! I love his songs, athey have so much life in them! He is very talented. I love his work. One of my friend's was listening to it over and over when the baby was in the womb, and now, whenever he starts to cry, you sing ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit It"" and he stops and smiles! It is sooooooooo cute! Anyway, Will is so hot. I love him!"
2,This CD sucked!,"This CD sucked. All of his songs are bouncy, and they get so old after like the 5th time you have heard him. The only thing it is good for is like parties where you are gonna be doin sum dancin."
4,This C.D. Getts better and better,"I love this CD. Will SMith gets more and more popular and more and more cute! His songs come more and more alive in each video, and his skills become more and more uquine. I LOVE WILL!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I HATE IT,"I have never been a real rap fan, and after purchasing this album, I know why. The only songs worth a penny (probably not even that much) are ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit It"", ""Miami"", and ""Men In Black"". To be honest, I'm not sure those songs are even worth being thought about."
3,Will Smith is an ingenious song writer.,"From my point of view, this CD is OK. I really don't like music like Will Smith writes, but I actually liked this CD."
1,bean from colfax,"listen,don't waist your money on stupid move stars trying to be a rapper.The only good song on the thing is ""Miami"" and if it wasent for that catchy chorus the whole CD whould be stupid so if they come out with a single of ""Miami"" I mite buy that but not the whole CD"
3,This is an o-k c-d.,"Some of the songs are good-like Getting Jiggy with it, Miami, Men In Black, and Chasing Forever. But I was extreamly mad about how Just the Two of us, sounded! And I hate the interlude's! This should definitly not be your first c-d! Maybe if your're more of a rap fan you'll like this c-d better. Overall, this is an o-k c-d."
3,Wills's first solo album,this is an ok album. it is not a good as a dj jazzy jeff and the fresh prince album. i like his music beucase it is clean rap with good beats. i gave it a 7out of 10
3,Rip Off,"First I just want to say that I love the Fresh Prince. DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince made some sweet music, that was fun and definately corny at times. Will Smith is doing his own thing now. I can enjoy his music. This new album is good, but lets be honest, many songs are rip offs of past classics and not so classics. The most famous song is probably Gettin' Jiggy Wit It. Do me a favor and listen to He's The Greatest Dancer by Sister Sledge. Enough said."
2,Not what I expected,"When I listened to some of Will's songs I said Hey I think I'll get this is CD. And was I wrong. The only good songs on there is ""Miami"" ""Just the two of us"" and ""Men In Black"" I was really disappointed and he is so hott too. I guess I thought wrong"
5,GREAT CD!,"Will Smith has all his great songs in this album! These songs are just great! The CD is worth the money big time! I'd say just buy it!!! I personally loved the song ""Just The Two Of Us!"" I would also like to listen to the Fresh Prince Album he has out!!!"
2,I cannot get with it!,"After hearing ""Men in Black"" and ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit It"", I wanted this CD like crazy. Good thing my 12-year-old cousin had it already and let me listen to it, so I saved my money. Those two songs are the only ones on the CD with anything to recommend them, and the interludes were truly annoying. And now that ""Jiggy"" and that horrible ""Just the Two of Us"" are all over the radio, I can't get away from it...Will, you can do better than this."
1,Not so good after all,"This train was a lot of fun at first after we put a little weight on the outside of the second car but for the money it hasn't lasted very long. It made it through 4 Christmases with no use in between and now the train wheels are completely bound up, won't turn at all in spite of cleaning and oiling. Rather disappointing considering the cost of the set.Later: After looking up the seller I have found there is no support whatsoever and no, parts are not available at hobby stores. In my opinion, this is just a fancy looking, fun atfirst, but poor quality very expensive model train. Now that the engine has frozen up the train is pretty much useless.I now give this product 1 star overall, 2 for educational value and 1 for durability. It was fun when it was working but what do you do with a train with no operating engine? You can'teven buy a replacement locomotive for it."
1,bad track design,"The track is harder to get together than it is to snap. It is not worth the trouble to put together and how long till it is broken and is worthless? Anyway I would never by one of these, no wonder it was given to us."
5,"Great Train, thrills the kids","I got this train over 10 years ago as a gift. I bring it out every year and put it under the tree. We now have two small children 4 and 2 and they love the train. In previous years, we kept their interaction with the train to a minimum. This year our 4 year old was involved in setting it up. After playing with it all day yesterday, our 4 year old can put the train back on the track and get the wheels lined up and get it running again. We let the two year old operate the controls. They got up this morning and the first thing they wanted to do was watch the train. I agree it is difficult to get the wheels lined and the electrical connections hooked but once you do it works great. In previous years it probably only got a few runs around the tree but this year it is in overtime. It's been running for the last hour, through breakfast with no issue. I had no idea the kids especially my 4 year old would love it soo much."
4,The kids love it,We have had this for five years and the Nephews just love it. a great set for around the Christmas tree
5,The Best Train I've Ever Had,This toy is funner than any toy I've had. Try the train in total darkness. The train is really fun when it is in darkness. The Holiday Express is really bright when it is in darkness. I am 9 years old.Holiday Express Animated Electric Train Set
5,Great Christmas Train,"This is a great train to go around the Christmas tree.Just make sure that the track is snapped together firmly, and all cars are hooked together. The engine won't go by itself, at least one of the other cars has to be attached. It definitely needs to be supervised by an adult, if little ones are operating it."
4,We like it!,"I was a little leary about ordering this because some reviewers reported having problems with it, but it seemed like the best overall deal for a Christmas train, and the most Christmasy.We love it. It takes some careful eye-hand coordination to make sure it's actually on the track, but all model trains require that.We're a two-adult/one-dog household, and the dog isn't interested in the train, so it doesn't face much of a survival challenge. I can see where in a household with multiple kids it could get damaged easily. It has lots of plastic parts--many moving--and I can see it getting broken by uncareful hands--or feet."
3,"Fun for the kids, can be difficult for parents","Just bought the train set and assembled it under the Xmas tree. Set up was very easy and the cars are very cool. I bought extra tracks and an additional car since the train set was going to go under our tree for the family to enjoy.The train derails pretty easily after only once or twice around the track (especially around the turns). While it is easy to put back on, it is a little annoying after the 50th time. The additional tracks came in handy but the additional car added only made the derailments more frequent. One trick is to slow the speed down so it doesn't take the corners too fast. Another trick is to make sure the track is clean and no debris is on the track.Once you find a good grove and the right speed, the train is very enjoyable. I would recommend a patient parent get this train set."
2,Frustrating after 3 years,"We bought this 3 years ago and it was soo much fun. Now it has all of the problems that other reviewers mentioned. Our 4 biggest compalints: 1. The tracks will break where they are snapped together. 2. The second car will jump the track and it is such a pain to put back on the track. 3. The light connectors to each car does lose the snuggness and falls out afer going around the track. 4. The sound buttons on the control pad do go out. So if you use this train for the kids to have fun, dont expect it to last too long."
5,hoiday express train set,"I was totally happy with this product, it operated as I expected it would, Totally satisfied with the product, and it arrived on the expected date."
3,Holiday Express animated train set,"Like other reviews on this site, we bought the train about ten to twelve years ago from Sam's Club for about $149 dlls tax included. The electrical connection between cars was hard to set up. No problem with the knuckles. The train would go off the track too often. It appears the groove on the wheels are not deep enough to fit on the G scale track. The train no longer works, probably a bad controller. Contacting the manufacturer which is located in China was and is useless. The train is no longer being manufactured. It is offered here and there on other sites, but unless it is new, I would not buy it again. I am not sure who will warrant the service if any. It's a shame that the manufacturer has no plans on building a better Christmas train."
2,Connection,We have used the trains for two years and our grandchildren love them. This year we cannot get them to work. Can anyone help....? We are thinking of purchasing a new set.
4,Holiday Train Set,I have a Holiday train set but......when I unpacked it for display this year the part that clips onto to track that the train gets it power from is broken. I need the replacement part so my train will run. Know where I can get such an item?
4,The big train,"We ordered this train to put it under the tree, when we got it we were surprise of how big it was, very cute, with lots of details but very loud and large for what we wanted for.You'll need a large space for this train, each car is between 10-12 inches long and about 6-7 inches tall and the tracks are at least 6 ft by 4ft. It has different lights & sounds but are very loud and even when you turn it down it doesn't help much. It's a beautifull train, and a great price but we returned because of the size,think about it, returning it can cost you $30-$60, it comes in a huge box!!"
1,Stay Far Away From This,I have never before written a product review. After 5 years of dealing with this tempermental train I am finally throwing it away. We set it up every Christmas and every Christmas we can get it to work for about 2 minutes. The cars derail all the time and the trains disconnect from each other all time. We COULD NEVER get it to run for more than a minute or two. I would not recommend this item at all.My brother in law who grew up with trains bought this same set and has stopped setting it up for the holidays.
2,people are stupid,How can nobody tell that Subaru is a girl? It's not that hard. This series was a waste of time.
4,Great Shampoo,"I bought this while looking for something natural for my daughter's black/bay mare to help enhance her coat. We used it for the first time at a Regional competion on another one of our horses,m a bright bay, and his coat looked fabulous. Soft and shiney and it does rinse very well. I had to buy more as soon as we got home becuase everyone else from our barn was using it too. I will try the other Oster Equine Care's now."
4,Saves Time,"This wide rake is more expensive than the usual standard issue offered in pool supply stores or sections but may be well worth the investment when there are a lot of leaves or flowers falling into the water, as it can save a lot of time cleaning up. It is not optimal for picking up debris from the pool bottom, even though that is possible, too. I am happy with the purchase."
1,1 word to describe the album - generic,"very weak and typical helloween of late! songs have this rehashed feel to it (one of them forgot the title is recycled from perfect gentleman). the guitar harmonies/interludes have been repeated a million times by all the powermetal bands, not to mention the generic double bass drum sound."
4,New Rabbit Outta Old Hat,"After listening carefully to this album I found it to be a great return to an old sound from a vintage Metal Band! Rabbit is truly a great album that lacks nohing in lyrics, melodies, and vocals that any of the older Helloween stuff encompassed! If you are a TRUE Helloween fan, then this album is a must have in your collection, you will not be dissapointed!"
2,What the #%#@%^# happened?!!!,"I really hate doing this and I mean I REALLY hate doing this. Helloween Is in my top 5 bands but this album sucks. I wanted to finish out my collection with this and Better than Raw but I don't know why I waited so anxiously waiting on this one. The lyrics suck (and I love Deris) and the music is mostly mediocre. There are a couple of songs on here that have some good soloing but there is no consistency and no rememberable songs. Basically, this is an easily forgetable cd that really has nothing to do with Helloween much like the latter Kiske albums, I hate to say.There has hardly anything to do with their usual subject matter and it has a lot of songs about male/female dynamics which has NEVER been in a Helloween song, outside of Metal jukebox which doesn't count. I'm just really dissapointed in this and hope I like Better Than Raw better than this."
3,Helloween - 'Rabbit Don't Come Easy' (Nulcear Blast),"After the band's last CD had a very limited number release here in the states,I don't think fans or even the band itself was exactly sure about the future of domestic Helloween releases.To everyone's delight,'Rabbit...' turned out to be a decent effort.Beat that!Certainly no 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys',but still worth seeking out a copy of.A couple of tracks that I personally thought stood out were ""Open Your Life"",""Never Be A Star"" and ""Don't Stop Being Crazy"".So nice to see this German heavy metal band still in existence.Hadn't seen them play live since the very first Mtv's Headbanger's Ball trek.Anyone else remember that?Line-up:Andi Deris-vocals,Michael Weikath-guitar,Markus Grosskopf-bass and Motorhead's Mickey Dee on drums.I may be a bit off about this.I always thought Helloween was a five piece.Should appeal to fans of Mercyful Fate,C.O.C.,Sabbat and Annihilator."
3,Post Grapow....,Ordered this CD about September 2007 from Amazon..the departure of Grapow and replaced by Sasha obviously sounds more happier metal compare to their previous releases excluding Pink Bubbles and Chameleon...(I mean from Master of the Rings until The Dark Ride) which more dark and serious!METAL got to be that way man...Anyway the album still one of my favourites..
5,they still got it,"You think that helloweeen would slow down and do a bad album, well they still know how to make great albums. I loved rabbit don't come easy. Every song is great. Great harmonies and awesome riffs."
5,"Happy, Happy Helloween With The Power Turned Up All The Way!","This album us fast, aggressive, catchy, melodic, and everything else you could possibly ask for in a Helloween album. The Dark Ride was more dark and mystical with an overall slower pace. It is an amazing album, but Rabbit Don't Come Easy is a return to form for Helloween. Helloween returns their happy, cheery, powerful style and intensifies it. You have your happy, happy songs like Just A Little Sign and The Tune. You have a dark, experimental track such as Back Against The Wall. We have one nice ballad that Andi Deris wrote for his beloved wife, Don't Stop Being Crazy and more. To me, the albums highlite is the epic Nothing To Say which even experiments with some Reggae elements. This album is the perfect mix, the perfect blend...the perfect recipe for Power Metal perfection! This is the very best Helloween album to date and a true gem. If you want the ultimate in Power Metal, purchase Rabbit Don't Come Easy...you won't regret it!"
2,Not impressed...,"I ordered these shoes because Clarks' are supposed to be quality, comfortable shoes. However, these have left blisters each time I have worn them, have a wobbly sole, and are not that attractive on."
1,Hard as a rock,Bought these because they had good reviews... they are are hard as rocks. And now I'm stuck paying to ship them back. But they're THAT bad
2,Indy Cars of the 1970's,"Good job of displaying B/W photo's, but not much on the history of the cars or drivers! You'll like it if your not into reading!"
4,"Great companion piece to ""Word of Mouth""","It's a shame that this soundtrack is so obscure because it contains some of the Kinks' best '80s work. ""Return to Waterloo"" and ""Expectations"" are beautiful laments to a lost England in the spirit of the ""Arthur"" album. Both would have been assets to ""Word of Mouth"" but thematically fit in better here. ""Lonely Hearts"" is a fun '50s-style ballad, ""Not Far Away"" rocks out in the same punkish vein as ""Sold Me Out,"" and ""Voices in the Dark"" works well as an atmospheric closer. All fine efforts. ""Going Solo,"" ""Missing Persons,"" and ""Sold Me Out"" are repeats from ""WOM"" of course, though the latter is present here in a slightly different edit.The relative scarcity of new material is troubling (even padded with the three ""WOM"" tracks, there's about 30 minutes of music here), but the title track and ""Expectations"" belong in any Kinks library, and the other tracks are solidly enjoyable, especially if you're a fan of ""Word of Mouth."" Recommended."
3,A disappoiting set,"I would easily hand out 5 stars for the invidual songs of this CD because Ray Davies really believed in the ""Return To Waterloo"" television play he wrote and produced in 1983. The songs are very good but the reason I give 3 stars is the lack of bonus material.Kinksfans had to wait for 20 years for this album to come out on CD and were hoping that Ray Davies could be persuaded to add some unreleased songs to the tracklist. The album was already relatively short on needle time and the original television play bolstered some songs that were not on the original vinyl album. Those songs could have fitted nicely on this CD. Instead we have a CD lasting some 30 minutes missing some very nice key tracks."
4,Soundtrack to TV film stands on its own,"Fans had to wait 20 years for ""Return to Waterloo"" to show up on CD and while it is missing bonus tracks (including a nice remix of one track and a demo for another), this is a very good album that stands well on its own.There are a couple of tracks here that were on ""Word of Mouth"" (the difference here is that Dave isn't on these versions) but the rest were completely new for the movie and this reissue is most welcome even if it isn't quite what many fnas were hoping for.There's a nice booklet with notes on the making of the movie and album included as well. For those looking at the track listing at this date amazon lists some of the tracks as featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg--rest assured Snoop ISN'T on these tracks and they are the original mixes and songs.It's a pity that we don't get any bonus tracks but that's no reason NOT to get this unusually short but potent album.Recommended."
4,"Also includes ""The Last Castle""","Why the publisher, and Amazon, omit this fact I don't know, but this book includes TWO classic Vance tales. ""The Last Castle"" is archetypal Vance: the refined, even effete, society forced to choose between its ideals and the harsh danger of reality. The tension between Vance's aesthetes and his action heroes is a constant in his books.This text is, if I recall aright, published with the aid of the Vance Integrated Edition project; in other words, the text is cleansed of the annoying typos that too often mar Vance's work. (Exhibit A, ""Tales of the Dying Earth,"" which no one appears to have edited before publication. Or if they did, they need to stay anonymous.)I prefer Vance's fantasy myself, but this book is a must-have if you appreciate Vance."
3,Traffic Kit Doesn't Work,I don't have any major complaints with the GPS unit - but I just wanted to warn prospective buyers that the traffic kit that's advertised as a possible add on to this unit doen't work for me in Baltimore/DC or several of the other cities that are listed in the coverage map. Go to the traffic kit and read the reviews there for more info.
1,No satalite link and no support from Magellan,"I purchased a Magellan CrossoverGPS a number of months ago. After not being able to get it to work, I have tried many times to get support from Magellan. I don't think they offer support. I have other Magellan products that work well, but this Crossover is a wreck. I would not recommend the Crossover to my ex-wife if I had an ex. If anyone can suggest how to get support from Magellan, please let me know.Thank you,Dave"
1,Save your money.,This is junk. I spent almost $300 dollars on this and from the start it locks up and will not track for minutes at a time. I sent it in for repair and they sent me a refurbished unit that does the same thing. I called them and they they dont make that unit anymore and willnot repair and was willing to give me $100 toward a new unit they do make now. I told them to shove it. What customer service they have. if I were you I would look at another manufacturer. 1 star is to good for a Magellan..
3,Crossover -crossed up,"Ordered crossover in January and while entering waypoints it locked up. Sent back to the GPS store for an exchange. Just went on trip from Boise Id to Las Vegas and the new unit locked up and kept returning to the Blue Screen. Contacted Magellan and they said a software update would fix it. Downloaded update last night and it appears it fixed the problem. Will see. I was ready to try to exhange it for a different unit but Magellan said this would work-Hopefully we will see. The tech support guy I talked to was difficult to talk to. He sounded like he was revved up on Red Bull and took forever to get him on the line. Tech support sucks. To use the topo and marine functions you have to buy memory cards loaded with the program at $200 a pop. That really sucks to have to buy cards at that price. Half that I could swallow. Further use, more money spent on sd cards will tell if it performs as expected. So far skeptical."
2,"Mixed feelings, probably not worth the money","I was very interested in this unit because of the cross-functionality: road navigation and outdoor/topographic maps. I am very pleased with the road navigation mode. I am very disappointed with the topographic maps. The built in maps have a 90 meter resolution and very little detail - they are close to worthless, particularly in relatively flat Ohio. According to the manual with the unit, 30 meter maps with much more detail are available on the website for the Continental US (loaded on SD memory cards). This is not true - there are no such maps currently available, and customer service was more than vague about when and if such maps would be available.Quite frankly, without this ability, the unit is not worth the extra cost. If I was going to do it over I would buy a cheaper road navigation unit and a topographic unit separately."
1,VERY OUTDATED MAPS OF THE UNITED STATES,"Magellan Crossover 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Road and Trail NavigatorTHIS MAGELLAN CROSSOVER GPS WORKS FAIRLY WELL BUT HAS EXTREMELY OUTDATED UNITED STATES MAPS. THEY ADVERTISE THAT THE UNITS COME WITH UP-TO-DATE MAPS OF THE UNITED STATES BUT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I JUST RECEIVED A NEW UNIT ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO (MARCH 14, 2008) AND FOUND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF STREETS AND HIGHWAYS THAT THE UNIT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW EXIST. AND YET THOSE SAME STREETS AND HIGHWAYS HAVE BEEN ON THEIR MAP SUPPLIER'S WEBSITE (NAVTECH) FOR SEVERAL YEARS. MAGELLAN CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWARE THAT THEIR MAPS ARE OUTDATED AND, IN ESSENCE, INDICATE THAT'S IT'S JUST YOUR TOUGH LUCK. BOTH TOM/TOM AND GARMIN GPS UNITS HAVE FAR MORE UP-TO-DATE MAPS THAN MAGELLAN. IF I HAD IT TO DO OVER AGAIN I WOULD BUY EITHER TOM/TOM OR GARMIN AND WOULD RECOMMEND YOU DO THE SAME."
4,Great GPS- no web site support,"This is a great GPS unit, but beware the magellan web site is useless with lots of errors. Their Tech support says they are working on it, the site has been like this for over a month. Phone tech support did help me dowload a update. I bought this unit because of the extra maps for it, but at this time you cannot buy or download them because of their poor web site. You can call sales to buy the preloaded SD card. Magellan cannot give a date when the website will be working- till then you just have to spend a long time on the phone to talk to a tech. 9/29/07"
2,Promises a lot.,"This unit just doesn't live up to all of the promises made in the advertisements. It does do a lot of different things, but nothing well.I could not get it to lock onto a signal properly and when it did it quickly lost it. Returned it to the dealer with no problem."
5,Magellan 2 Thumbs Up !!,I don't have a lot of experience with GPS units but this seems pretty easy to use and I haven't had any problems with it yet. I personally like it very much.Magellan Crossover Vehicle GPS with Topographic Maps (Green)
3,Great idea...not so good execution,"First of its kind. Claimed to provide a good mix of on and off road, and water, navigation. I find the mapping is not good in my area, Northern California. It sends my to non-existent roads, is unable to find streets in places like bend, OR. It had me exit a freeway and then re-enter at the same spot???? The included off road maps do not shown forest service roads however their is an optional Topo Map which may or may not, they can't tell me. It may be a mute point since the Topo maps are only available on CD and this unit uses SD cards. Seems this was a rush to market product before Garmin. Great concept...not so good execution."
2,The Magellan Crossover for GeoCaching,"I just got a Magellan Crossover and found out that it just doesn't work well for GeoCaching. Magellan really missed a big market by not adding geocaching functionality to this unit. The device doesn't recognize .GPX, .LOC or .GS geocache files. The only way I've found to get geocaches on the unit is to enter the coordinates manually or covert and upload geocache files as POI's."
1,Not all its cracked up to be.,"For the road this item worked okay but using it for hiking it stinks. It does not show any rivers on it only elevation's. It has some good points by plotting where you go but to program this function is confusing. I wanted to get a program for it that had a map of Florida, they had none."
2,Poor maps - customer service,"Had the unit less than 30 days - have 21 map version - most recent 32 - Magellan wants $80 to update, also outofdate firmware - can't process update on website as indicated, technical support no support at all. . Several addresses and cities are not found in the system that are located on OnStar/TomTom/Garmin systems. Have requested customer service assistance 3 times - still have not heard. Can't return it to the store as over 15 days since purchase.WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN"
2,does everything but nothing good.,"very disappointed with their maps. I called Tech support (India) and they told me they were 2006 maps. My home subdivision was established in 2003, yet none of it is included. Another friend lives in an older part of town (built in the late 70's early 80's) The Crossover cannot find him or any of his direct neighbors. I had issues with on-ramps listed where they are not, also a change done by our city many years ago. They say a new update is coming in 08 yet i will have to pay for it!!! I had an old Magellan from the late 90's with road maps and I would venture to say this one is not any better. Calculating trip times are not even close to realistic. The time was calculated off traveling 45 MPH when the speed limit on this highway was 65 MPH. I cannot recommend anyone buying this unit. I thought i could have a good all around unit but this does nothing good, I would have been better off buying separate units."
4,crossover,Product performed well... if you have fat fingers you may have some difficulty with access to virtual buttons close to the edge of the screen.Screen was easy to see even in bright daylight. Audible directions were clear and concise. Some remaining issues with the use pc downloads and utilities but I havn't spent much time there.
3,Doesn't really 'crossover',The Magellan Crossover does not perform well in 'off-road' applications. E.g. I can not download my tracks and waypoints into my PC like I could with my old Garmin III+ and Mapsource maps.Also the songs and pictures I uploaded to memory (purchased separately) were lost. I do not know if the problem was the memory or the GPS.It is a good on-road GPS for the automobile. But there are several GPSs dedicated to on-road use that are just as good and less expensive.
3,"Great product, horrible customer service from Magellan!","I just purchased the Crossover GPS for my husband. He loves it. The big screen and ease of use is wonderful. My complaint is with Magellan's customer service and tech support. Due to their web issues, I was unable to download MapSend Lakes West, and ended up spending a total of more than five hours on the phone over four days before I found someone that would help me. Their reps would say ""Let me pull up the file, hold on one moment,"" then I would get stuck back on hold for 10-15 more minutes, then a new person would come on the line. Whenever I asked for a supervisor, they told me there were no supervisors available. I was repeatedly transferred back and forth between tech support and customer service. They did not help me until I told them I was going to dispute the charge with my credit card company. I would much prefer to own a product from a company that takes care of customers the first time!!"
2,Crossover doesn't live up to promise,"I bought the Crossover when it first became available but it hasn't lived up to the promise. The most notable problem is that front window is made of glass. The manual doesn't mention this and it's costing me $150 to get mine repaired. This seems like a MAJOR design flaw in a unit that is sold for ""outdoor"" use. Also, the promised detailed topographic add-on maps aren't available for the unit yet. I wanted to use the unit on my bike but they only offer a motorcycle mount that weighs about as much as my bike. On the plus side, it seems to work well on the road."
4,Magellan Crossover 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Road and Trail Navigator,Good product does a ton... easy to use after a learning the ins and outs a little big but still very handy... good instructions does have trouble in tall buildings (NYC) Overall a good investment.
2,Very Outdated maps,"This unit does get you to your destination as long at it is on the maps that are provided. The problem is the maps are several years old and to get new maps costs a additional $75. Also the ""great"" TOPO system it has does not include TOPO's for the USA. They do have TOPO's for Mexico and Canada but not the USA. One other problem is when you call customer service it is in India and I for one can not understand what they are saying at all. They would not transfer me to to the USA either.All together I don't think I would buy this product again, hopefully there will be a better crossover soon."
2,Needs maps updated!!,"This would be a spectacular GPS if Magellan would update the maps for it. I won't recommend it until they do!! I have been misled by the Crossover several times. On the somewhat newer bridges in my area, it looks as though the car is a boat crossing a bridge-less body of water. However, the off-road feature works well."
4,Best GPS for me !,"I have had the Magellan Crossover for a few weeks now and find it to be quite a useful tool. I like the large screen, its easy to see in the daytime and at night. A simple but smart layout of the navagation screen. I am getting almost 8 hours of battery life before recharging. I carry it around with me every day for work use and on the weekend I kayak fresh and saltwater it comes with me there too.If I broke it would buy the same one again.A great review of this product found here: [...]"
2,Topo maps very poor; no upgrades,"Great idea to have topo and roads on the same unit, but topo maps are 90 meter (so topo lines about every 300 feet of elevation) and other map features such as streams are missing. I couldn't find a way to get any map upgrades--an FAQ on their website says none are available, although the instruction manual claims you can use programmed SD cards for upgrades (and even shows pictures of how much better the upgraded maps look on the unit). That's pretty deceptive. I bought this to replace my old sportrak pro, which has great downloadable maps and navagation features, but is slow and has a poor screen. This unit might be great for driving, but don't buy this if you also intend to use it in a serious way for outdoors or hiking. I'm returning mine today."
5,Almost everything you need to know about Illinois politics,"This volume, the first collection of Steve Neal's columns, is a virtual feast for all those interested in the major players in American politics and government from l950 to the present. Steve Neal is a competent historian as well as a perceptive columnist, so his writing reflects both scholarly research as well as realistic insights. His columns catch the essence of his subjects and reading them is pure delight. Of course his point of view may conflict with yours; he doesn't hide his feelings; but that too is half the fun. In a hundred years this will be one of the volumes consulted to find out what our politicians were really like. Fortunately, we don't need to wait. Just order this book now."
3,Not what I expected...,"While the collection of columns from Mr. Neal are somewhat interesting, they don't really provide any insight into Chicago politics that I didn't know already.I will suggest this book for people who know absolutely nothing about Chicago or Illinois politics and wish to learn the basics of notable figures quickly."
5,Comments on Will's Way,"This novel gives a graphic description of what it's like to go completely down and out on booze. The book begins by telling how the title character, Will, goes downhill through his alcoholism. The plot goes a little more slowly in the first part, but it picks up and gets really good by the time Will is out on the streets, which is not too far into the book.The descriptions of life as a homeless person are really graphic. But this part of the book is not all tawdry and downtrodden as one might expect. Even at his worst moments, Will runs into some humorous situations, especially a couple of times when he's dealing with governent workers.I like the book because it gives a real insight into what a homeless person goes through. The characters talk a lot, so it stays interesting all the way through. It appears that the author wrote it in a simple way on purpose, because it is easy to understand--no underlying symbolism or preaching, just a good story told from start to finish."
5,Great cd for those whole are old school gamers,"I would recommend this cd to anyone who remembers the good old days of the NES and the original Super Mario Bros. This cd has all of the cool music tracks from the games plus some tracks which you may have forgotten about. The songs are nice but there are a couple of minor points to be aware of. Most of the tracks are a minute long or less-so most tunes only playthrough once but the songs are catchy enough that the length really doesn't matter. Also the tracks do come up in japanese when detected by itunes, so you will need an english translation for your track listing. Overall however, this is a smart purchase for any nintendo fan. It's a shame that this cd (among others) is hard to find in this country. This is the only place in which I have found this product."
5,Another high 5 stars!,"I know Evanovich will likely get tired of Plum novels before her fans do, but in the mean time she doesn't disappoint us. I've just recently become interested in crime novels, so I bounce back and forth between Evanovich and other crime novel authors. However, the others fall short without the delightful element of humor I get from JE's Plum series. The little person in this one worked so well, I had hoped to see him again. Oh, well."
5,Great Book,"Janet Evanovich has a way of writing that keeps you glued to the book till the end. Once you start reading, you can't put it down till it's finished."
4,Laughing out loud,This series of books actually causes me to laugh out loud while reading. Not deep but plenty of fun. I hope Stephanie never gets rid of the Buick. My only problem with this book was the way it ended.
5,One of the best books I have read all year!!!,"I enjoyed High Five very much. It was suspensful, fast pace, hysterically funny and hard to put down. I loved Grandma Mazur.This is the first time I have every read Janet Evanovich. I just had to order the rest of the book. I hope she writes more."
5,Janet Evanovich How do you do it!,I am so hooked on Stephanie Plum and her friends and family. I cannot wait for the next book Hot Six to arrive. How far will Stephanie go? It is great light reading and laugh out loud entertaining. Never depressing. My husband enjoys reading all her book also. Thank you Janet!
5,Morelli or Ranger????,"Stephanie's torrid affair with dear Joe Morelli is history for now - maybe - she needs more money than she's making being a bounty hunter, and her family is more trouble than she needs. So what else is new? She asks Ranger for help, and he gets her a job that's even MORE dangerous than bounty hunting, if that's possible. Ranger, who has remained Stephanie's mentor, may be angling for more of her affections, and makes a worthy rival for Joe Morelli. The ending, however, is one hell of a cliffhanger."
4,Wonderful Read!,"Janet Evanovich definitely does it right! Although I like her previous novels a little better, I certainly would not have passed this one up. I have been waiting for Stephanie to notice Ranger for quite some time. This book has all the ups and downs for Stephanie. Her character is very real--even when it comes to cars. It's an easy, enjoyable, laugh out loud mystery. I would recommend this entire series to anyone who has a sense of humor and especially those who enjoy mysteries."
5,Loved It!!!,Ms. Evanovich has done it again. I could not put it down. The only thing I was disappointed in was the ending. Can't wait for # 6. How soon before it comes out?
4,High Five,This is one of her better books. It was written before I started reading her series. It would make a good movie as with One For The Dough!
1,Author is awful,"You find out right at the beginning of the book that between the last one and this one she and Morelli have already been in a relationship and broken up. The one thing you've been waiting to happen for 4 BOOKS and the author cuts you out of it. Oh, you reading this for Stephanie and Morelli's relationship? Joke's on you. How rude of this author. Such a disappointment. I wish I never had invested the time or money into reading this series."
3,So so,Average adventure of Ms. Plum. I enjoy reading these books of Ms. Evanovich because they are a quick read and always some humor in with the misadventures. Gotta love Grandma Mazur and Lula for their gunfighting abilities.
4,Keep 'em coming!,"Janet Evanovich can really make a mystery! Stephanie is starting to think more with her head and that makes a great role mature. New jersey has never seemed so hilarious as this tight knit community. I will admit, every scene that involved a Close Encounter of the Ranger Kind left me breathless... Plum, kick Morelli to the curb!!!"
2,series is on the skids,"I have been a fan of Janet Evanovich since her days of pulp romance titles and I was very pleased to have her enter into the mystery-romance hardback theater. I enjoyed her first four books in the series but this last one HIGH FIVE simply rehashed old themes. Janet can do so much better than this. Stephanie is a great character and the possibilities are endless for her development and further adventures but this installment (book five) fell short. I also felt that the abundance of profanity was just a cover for the lack of a good solid story. The ""shock"" value of the language soon worn thin and became more boring than shocking. I certainly would not be able to reccommend this part of the series to teenage readers. Please return to the 'old' delightful feisty character and her struggles through life and rely less on tired themes and vulgar language. Yes, I will still have to read the next book in the series because I am not giving up yet. I hope it will be a good one!"
3,review,Stephanie needs some work because nobody is skipping out on bail.. Then her mom drafts her in to looking for her Uncle Leon who disappeared while running errands. She also starts taking on jobs working for Ranger. Another fun installment in the series
2,NOT AS GOOD AS HER FIRST FOUR BOOKS,"OK, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST FOUR BOOKS. I WAS HAPPY THAT I DID NOT BUY IT."
1,The Language Is Offensive,"A couple of acquaintances recommended Stephanie Plum and Evanovich to me for humourous reading. It was a waste for me. They are many ""fun"" books out there with decent language to take up my spare time."
2,"Love the Stephanie Plum Series, Hate this abridged version","Overall, I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum series, but I wasn't pleased with this particular one due to the fact that it's an abridged version and it was extremely unpleasant listening to Debbie Mazar narrating the story. My best advice is to get unabridged versions with C.J. Critt or Lorelei King. Heck, even the abridged versions with Lorelei King are much better than this one."
5,If you read one you'll read another,"Great suspense and adventure and each book gets a little more interesting or exciting like you were there, I would recommend any of her books, although I do have a few favorites."
5,As usual never disappointing!!,"Janet Evanovich is an awsome writer! She makes me laugh, makes the story so real as if I'm standing right there with Stephanie and all the regular characters. I am so happy to have been introduced to her first book & I haven't stopped buying her books cuz I'm hooked!! Loved this book!"
5,Not quite as much humor but another great read by Evanovich!,"Stephanie Plum is growing in all directions. Not as many laughs as 1-4 but enough to keep you going. Definitely liked the new twist with Ranger, not only as Ranger Inc. but as a little competition for Morelli. Evanovich still has many places to go with this character. Can't wait for #6."
4,Ending unnecessary,"I whipped through this book while flying... having fellow passengers wondering what was so funny. I enjoyed the play between Stephanie and Ranger and the whole cast of characters as crazy and endearing as they are. What I didn't like was the ending.....Ms Evans read your reviews, you have a growing number of fans who will pay hardcover prices without your having to tweak the ending. I thought it an unnecessary marketing ploy."
3,"Great series, so-so entry","Hailing from the Garden State myself, I've known many women like the resourceful Stephanie Plum (and admit to sporting the big hair and eyeliner look myself on occasion . . .). I've been hooked on this series since ""One For The Money""--Janet Evanovich has a deft touch with dialogue, and many of the scenes are laugh-out-loud funny. However, ""High Five"" shows the first signs that the series might be running out of steam--many of the scenes are retreads from the earlier books, albeit with different names. And suddenly Ranger is in the picture as a romantic interest for Stephanie? Here's hoping ""High Five"" is just a speed bump, rather than the start of something bad."
5,HOT!HOT!HOT!,"Janet Evanovich does it again! For all of you who have been waiting for the next annual installment in the Stephanie Plum (mis)adventures, you will not be disappointed in HIGH FIVE. Stephanie is at her best, the family (including Dad) is as uproaring as ever, but the mysterious Ranger starts coming alive. You won't want to put this one down - so grab a copy, disconnect the phone, and read non-stop from cover to cover."
4,New directions for Stephanie Plum,"Stephanie Plum seeks some different work to pay her bills, and goes to work for Ranger in some of his enterprizes. In the meantime she is looking for Uncle Fred who has disappeared. Fred is a tightwad who was disputing a bill from a trash collection company, and wants a $2 refund because they missed collecting one day. That sets off a chain of events resulting in various murders and an attempt of Stephanie's life. As usual with Stephanie, there are several plots intertwined including Ranger's enterprizes, her work as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie, her search for Uncle Fred, and her love life. It is a fast moving plot, and I found it more interesting than the previous novel in the series."
5,Doesn't Get Any Better!,"Quality stays up there book after book. So many authors seem to march slowly downhill with each succeeding book. Janet Evanovich sense of humor keeps me laughing out loud, something I rarely do while reading. I look forward to meeting her characters again, like old friends."
4,Another Winner,"I've read all the Stephanie Plum books up to this one--at the time of this review Hot Six is out but I've not yet gotten it. This one, High Five, is top of the line. I especially enjoyed these last two books, Four to Score and High Five. Janet Evanovich has hit her stride with snappy dialogue, whacky characters and hilarious relationships. The plot is a little thin--you kind of wonder why everyone can't see it, given that Stephanie, Joe Morelli, and the Feds are all on the same case here, but then you don't really read these books for the plot. Evanovich gives us a bit of a puzzler at the end--an O. Henry-esque ending that had me laugh out loud. This series is a lot of fun, and I really enjoy it. I hope she gets off some of the running gags, though. The car thing is losing its appeal....how much longer can that go on?"
3,Not much has changed,"I enjoyed the first four books in the Stephanie Plum series. Watching her morph into a bounty hunter has been fun. However, this one seems like a re-hash, with the comedic elements starting to wear thin. As in the four prior books, Plum bungles cases, nearly gets murdered several times, has her apartment broken into, has her car explode, and engages in a love-hate relationship with Morelli. I just didn't find much of it funny this time. The mystery (a missing uncle) is good but seems to take a back seat to the comedy. ""High Five"" is not a bad book, and I'll probably read the next in the series. However, it would be good to see Plum improve at her job rather than her ineptness played for laughs. Note: This review is of the Kindle version. The transfer to e-book has been done well, and I found no major errors in the text."
4,Stephanie and Grandma Strike Again,"Stephanie has herself in all sorts of trouble now, when the FTA's aren's appearing except for a little man she has to apprehend Stephanie decides to go to Ranger for some work. Which has it's ups and downs. She's also on again off again with Joe Morelli which has her all upside down. I love this series and especially Stephanie's crazy grandmother who up to her usual antics taking pictures of a dead corpse. It's always full of great humor and adventure."
2,"A Little Good Editing, Please","I enjoyed the book, but the typos and sloppy editing were very annoying! Bad formatting, obviously no proof reading! I expect better from Amazon!"
4,high five,"the editorial reviewer who said this book wasn't as good as her others. It wasn't, but even that still merits four stars. It still made me laugh out loud, feel miserable and also cringe horribly (particularly towards the end)."
4,High five to Janet Evanovich!,She never fails to deliver. The Stephanie Plum series is everything you'd want and more. I love when you are in the middle of a suspenseful situation and end up laughing because Grandma Mazur does something ridiculous. Kudos.
4,Evanovich,"As always this authors books make me chuckle. The only thing I do not like is sometimes the language is a bit bad, so I would not like for a young person to pick it up and start reading those spots of the book. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a chuckle when reading a book that actually has a story line."
5,My fave of the series to date,"This was a funny, sexy read. My fave in the series so far. I have to admit I did take issue with how the result of the search turned out, but with a dynamite ending like High Five has, who cares!"
5,Excellent every time,"I have read the whole Stephanie Plum series twice- I read fast, and still laugh uproarously on the London tube on my way to work (a big no-no if you have ever lived here). Unfortunately books are pricey so I bought High Five as a Christmas present for my best friend, when she was done she handed it to me and said ""call me when you are done"". I did and we swore about Janet for a good ten minutes. How can you leave people hanging like that at the end of a book and expect them not to chew off their own feet in frustration? Can't wait for number six, please hurry"
5,Fun and fast paced!,"Excellent book, fast read...great junk food for the mind. I just want to know one thing....when did Ms. Evanovich meet my grandmother to write about her like that? :)"
5,Laugh out loud funny!,"Jersey's favorite bounty hunter is back to solve yet another mystery. What has happened to her Uncle Fred? And why were pictures of a dead body among his possessions?Once again Stephanie is out to get her man, this time her own uncle. With her stun-gun-toting grandma in tow, an angry little man and two very, very sexy men Stephanie has her work cut out for her. With high hair and an awsome manicure, Stephanie will be sure to nail this case. Highly recommended."
4,Stephanie does it again!,"As always, I have another 'page-turner'. It's hard to put it down once I get started. Good job, Janet Evanovich!"
5,Will I be able to stand the wait?,"I have been waiting for the latest installment of Stephanie's adventures for over 12 months - it was well worth it! Great, fabulous, wonderful! Came home, took the phone off the hook and refused to answer the door and returned to Jersey to catch up with my old friends - Stephanie, Lulu, Joe, Ranger etc. My tip - don't read this in public - you will embarrass yourself by laughing out loud. The ending was great - who is it? Joe or Ranger? Janet, please don't make us wait another year to find out - the suspense will kill me!"
4,Entertaining and Funny,"This book was fantastic. It had mystery, romance and was absolutely hilarious. I loved it until the very last page."
4,"Lost a little of the shine, but still worth multiple giggles","I started off wanting to give this book three stars, but I couldn't in all honesty do it. I might think it's a three-star book, but I really enjoyed it like a four-star book.Evanovich is one of the most engaging writers out there, and even though it seems like she reaches a little bit too far in places to get the laughs, I still laughed.Stephanie Plum's career as a bounty hunter is stalled, so she decides to do a little extra work of dubious legality for Ranger while looking for her missing Uncle Fred. Rude jokes, car explosions, and bad hair galore."
4,Getting Predictable,"I like Evanovich's humor - one star. I like her odd and very real life characters - two stars. I like her setting for these stories - three stars. She sure knows how to make me chuckle and how to draw a word picture of a sexy man - four stars. (I can't decide between Joe Morelli and Ranger for Stephanie.) My problem with her books is that the behavior of this principal character, Stephanie Plum, is becoming predictable. We can count on her to do something extremely stupid, thus endangering herself and others, at just the moment when she should truly know better. I find that sort of predictability annoying - no fifth star."
5,Janet's Best Yet,"I laughed until I hiccuped - I love all of Janet Evanovich's books, but this is by far her best! She is back in fine form after a disappointing Four to Score, and her characters couldn't be better. Stephanie is the best heroine out there, and loyal readers will be holding their breath for MORE!"
3,Okay book,"It wasn't the best one that I have read so far, but I did enjoy it. Plot is still good and I will definitely read the next one!"
5,Janet Evanovich's High five,"Love, love, love the characters. Grandma Mazur is a hoot, who wouldn't want a grandma like that! Lula, she's in a class all by herself, and to have Steph's ""man"" problem deciding between Joe and Ranger.... Of course for a Bounty Hunter, she gets in and out of trouble (not to mention, always finding the dead guys) like there's no tomorrow.."
4,"Not literature, but who cares?","This is by far the most fun I've had reading a mystery series. Stephanie Plum is a wisecracking bounty hunter with a hamster, a spunky grandmother, and two men to choose from. Evanovich sense of place and time is terrific, her characterizations are individual, and her pace is quick.She has said that she writes for people who don't have much time to read and if she can write on command like that, more power to her. She does not pretend to be writing literature, but that has its place, and so does this. I call it fluff, but in a good way. It's mindless fun, something you don't have to think about. And sometimes that exactly what I want."
1,Not as good as earlier Plums,"I am a great fan of this series, of Stephanie Plum and the author, but was disappointed in Number 5. Perhaps having Stephanie work for/with Ranger was the problem - for me it diffused the opportunities for Stephanie to behave in her customery klutzy fashion and also watered down the relationship between Stephanie and Joe.Looking forward, hoepfully, to number 6 ...."
4,Start the series with # 1 and hold on to your seat!,"Evanovich takes you for a ride down Crackin' Up Lane. I have laughed at this series so hard Ive cried!Grandma! She kills me!Joyce - Ugh that witch!Lula - the worst dressed, ghetto mouthed xhooker you will ever just adore!Ranger - Mysterious and sexy, Do we want him? hmmm Do we dare?The trusty Buick - the only thing that survives her antics.Joe - ooohlala!If you picked up this book and you haven't read the first 4 STOP! I promise you will enjoy every book more if you read them in order.Just warn people around you about sudden bursts of laughter!Enjoy"
3,not USA quality,"The moment you open the box up ,You know that it's not made in the USA,,,,it's ok as a starter piece but surprised that Holley releases this with there name on it,,,,,,Guys,do quality control better on your product"
2,Nothing new but the actors and directors...,"I knew this was a low-budget effort from new directors, but as I am always on the lookout for new horror flicks I hoped for the best. Oh, well... I suppose I should state from the beginning that those 2 stars above are for unbridled horror film enthusiasm alone; I seldom hate a decent horror film. That said, there just isn't much to thrill at here and none of it new. The atmosphere seldom rises to the occasion, the sets (alot of apartment settings) didn't improve matters, most of the acting is amateurish or simply flat, and the stories seemed to start nowhere and return there as quickly as the thin plots could carry them. Most standard horror film sequels are better than this."
3,I don't know,"I've had this book for so many years, and still can't get through it. I guess it just isn't my cup of tea, I'm not interested in hustlin' corn whiskey; however, WHORESON is fool-style...Just finished reading it and am very pleased that I bought this book...It's in my top 5...Dopefiend is good as well, but Black Girl Lost is better, yet not better than Whoreson..."
1,"I like the genre, but not this book","I'm a big Walter Mosely fan. When I recommended him to an acquaintance he said Donald Goines was his favorite author, so I gave Black Gangster a try. The writing was amateurish, the characters were all unlikeable, there was no message, no metaphor, no humor, no nothing. It was a complete waste of time. If you think about buying this book, think again and buy a Easy Rawlins mystery by Mosely."
2,Shrug my shoulders...,"This is the third book that I've ever read by Donald Goines and now I'm confused about whether I like him as an author or not. This book was really hard for me to get into after Prince got out of jail. Then when the Cougars came in, I was all over it. Then when Ruby got all Queen Bee, I was bored again. It was just one big roller coaster of emotions. I'm still going to read another one, because I didn't like his first one, thought the second one was great...so I figure there's a pattern there too!"
4,ONE OF THE BEST,THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THEBEST BOOKS I HAVE READTRUE TO THE GAME AND B-MORECAREFULMIXED UP IN ONE DO NOT EVENCOME NEAR THIS BOOK
4,Great music and mixes! Excellent R&B sound!,The entire cd is worth the purchase... music is very well mixed and blends well with each other. Songs keep you dancing and moving...!
2,Disappointing,"I have always looked forward to Mr. Tanenbaum's novels. This one is a disappointment: Slow, too much trivia even though one expects and even looks forward to some about Butch, Marlene, Lucy, and Tran. Admittedly, though, I am only a third of the way through the book. If I change my mind when finished, I shall say so."
4,Butch and Marlene head NY's best dysfunctional family.,"After a slow start, involving young Lucy Karp, her rather silly friends, and a doctor in a genius lab, the latest addition to the wonderful Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi series, kicks into high gear. I love all the characters from the mysterious Tran, to the long dead but pivotal, Jerry Fein, to the self righteous Columbo (no relation to the Peter Falk creation or the NY crime family). Tannenbaum is a master at tying the plots of organized crime, a woman's shelter, a sad pre-teen, and a bag lady, and making it all delightful and plausible. I'm looking forward to the next in this great series."
3,ho-hum,"I've read all of the Butch Karp books. Although I wait with eager anticipation for each new release, I was disappointed in this case. This was certainly not one of the author's better efforts in a series that has been in a slow, but steady decline over the past three or four installments. The story was slow, the character portrayal flat and uninspired. Mr. Tanenbaum seems to have placed the series in back into transition. One can only hope it will return in a better place. As much as I regret saying this, I honestly think it's time Mr. Tanenbaum took a break from Butch & Marlene, much like Steve Martini did from Paul Madriani or John Sanford from Lucas Davenport."
3,He Has Been Better,"Having read many of the books in the Karp/Ciampi series by this writer, I noted that I was able to depend on a story that was well written with a rather simplistic plot, characters that had depth as well as a good mystery. The writer supplies one of his most complex plots with numerous characters being intoduced in a rapid fire manner. This is done while juggling numerous plotlines that do not seem to intersect until one has completed almost seventy percent of the book. At that time, the stories finally intersect and the action is fast and furious. Although good, it really is not worth the long wait. The characters are almost cartoonish unless one has been reading this series and are not really well developed. There is Butch the Honest along with Marlene the Vigilante and daughter Lucy, now twelve, the Child Prodigy. This book is fair, yet appears to be in search of direction. Although good, it is not one of Tanenbaum's better works."
3,Gotta read it all and pay attention,I disagree with the previous review--in fact I wonder what book was read by the writer of that review. This book is worth the money. It is romance! IT is NOT writer of the year stuff. NOT Hemmingway or Twain. Just a ROMANCE novel JEEEZ!
5,Very Smooth,"The cds were included as stated, and the book was in very good condition. It was exactly what I was looking for."
2,Lumiscope Truss,"Lumiscope Golden Crown Truss Double, Mediumbulky, uncomfortable and very difficult to adjust. item must fit snuggly but the adjustment straps are nearly impossible to adjust for a comfortable fit; although it can relief the pain somewhat of an inguinal hernia, the trade off is an ever irritating fit. sadly, surgery looks to be the only alternative i have."
3,Didn't even try it on.,"To whom it may concern. I didn't even get to try it on! I ordered another brand belt and a large there was [ 36-38""]. I ordered a Large on the Golden Crown Truss and a Large there is[42-45""]. What I can't figure out is why Amazon doesn't have the owners of each hernia companies, in their decsription of their particular product put the size of each of their trusses so you don't have to second guess what their size equivalents are. Then all you'd have to do is check size and ex. Large is [42-45""] or Large is [36-38""] thus eleminating ordering a Large and getting it in the mail and low and behold it's the wrong size. Amazon , I haven't had a complaint, I think, until now. Get your HEAD OUT AND UPDATE THIS EASILY SOLVABLE PROBLEM.Lumiscope Golden Crown Truss Double, Medium"
1,Lumiscope Truss,"I ordered the double truss as single not available. I had no hint as to the proper size so just guessed at medium large. It fit fairly well. However, the double pads for the hernia would have necessitated all new trousers as made pelvic area a lot larger. Amazon should carry more models and have a guide as to waist sizes."
1,sizing,"USE CAUTION IN ORDERING; How does one know what size a medium or large or any of those offered will fit? I ordered one, not knowing what size I needed, and now I am charged to return, because they say it is not their fault that I ordered the wrong one. Again, How does one know what a medium or large size is? USE CAUTION"
3,"It is very good, but...","The design is very good and it certainly functions as it should. However, in my case my skin had an allergic reaction to the lining of the truss. I have stopped wearing it until the rash clears up. I plan to try to tack on a different lining that does not cause me a skin problem."
2,Dog removed handle within 5 minutes,"I gave it two stars because she had a lot of fun removing it, and she is still playing with the partially deflated ball left. My dog is a 90 pound lab/ pitt mix."
1,Jolly Ball,"Ball was destroyed within minutes of first use. Was much happier with other products from the same company, but this one did not seem to quite hold up."
2,Our kid likes this more than our dog,"We have an Australian Cattle Dog (1-year old), and he just looks at this thing. We throw it in the yard, and he'll run after it, but doesn't like to carry it.Our little girl seems to find more uses for it than our dog, and seems to enjoy spinning it, as well as pretending that it's a bouncy ball (it isn't bouncy). She sits down on it, holds the handle, and pretends to bounce around the living room on it. Not what I wanted to see from this toy..."
5,Great Value & Super product!,"Barney loves this ball!She herds it, retrieves it, and sometimes just carries it around the yard like it is a friend.Great value for play and exercise of strong chewers."
4,fun for the dogs,"i have a yellow lab that destroys everything and it took 8 months of biting to finally break this toy. this has been one a very few that seems to last with my dog.i would have given 5 stars if it was still in 1 peice but only 4 stars because its not fully indestructable.all in all, i will by this toy once a year for my dog."
5,My lab loves this ball,This is a great ball. This is my second one. My lab loves it. He plays with it for hours.
5,horsemans pride jolly ball,"I bought this ball for a very active yearling colt. He absolutely loves his toy. After about a week he did make a tear in the handle, however he is a horse. The ball is soft enough to not cause damage to his mouth, yet tough enough for a horse to bite, and throw around the yard. When he destroys this one I will definately replace it. It keeps him entertained for hours, and keeps him from constantly nipping the older horses in the pasture."
1,Broken in 4 minutes flat,"My 50 pound heeler - aka Australian Cattle Dog - had the handle ripped off at the base within 4 minutes flat of taking this ball out of the package. Yes, she is rough on toys, but really - 4 minutes? I'd tried the smaller one before, and it suffered the same fate. I'd hoped the larger one would be tougher - it's for a horse!If you have a rough player, don't waste your money on these. The toys that have survived for us are Busy Buddy, Kong, Jolly Pet, and Hollee Roller."
3,Jolly Ball,"I have a 9 month old Siberian Husky and had heard how the Jolly ball was not only great for horses, but for dogs as well. So I broke down and paid the $18 and bought one. She does absolutely love it! However, within a half hour of giving it to her, she had chewed a big hole in the handle. Now the handle is completely gone, but she still loves playing with it. It's nice because even though it is punctured, it does not deflate. I just wish they could figure out a way to make the handle better so it can't be so easily destroyed, because she loves carrying it by the handle. We put a rope in the handle so she could still carry it around."
3,Needs a tougher handle,"Jolly Ball is a great toy for a large breed dog, providing the dog isn't too destructive. I've gotten several of these for my Labrador Retreiver over the last three years and the first one gave him hours of fun until he chewed a big hole in the handle and it became roadkill. Each successive Jolly Ball lasted a little less time than the previous. The last only lasted less than an hour before my boy turned it into roadkill.If Jolly Ball could make a ball with a solid rubber handle, that a labrador could tear apart so quickly, I would happily buy some more. But Jolly Balls are a bit pricey for a toy that doesn't last my dog more than an hour."
4,Bought for a Great Dane puppy,"I purchased this horse toy for a Great Dane puppy (7mos, 100lbs).He quickly removed the handle, so you should supervise that your animal doesn't eat it. The ball itself cannot 'pop' or deflate, which is a plus. He does like to play with it and enjoys throwing it around himself and chasing after it.Rating it four stars because I'm not sure how well it is for a horse, but it is good for a dog except the handle gets chewed off in a few days."
2,Not like my fist Jolly Ball,"This is the second jolly ball I have ordered from Amazon, I thought it would be same as previous, but this ball is soft rubber, not hard rubber like previous one. My boxer destroyed in minutes, we still have the first one, only issue he chewed off some of the handle. New ball is in trash, back to older one."
1,Not for large dogs,"We have a GS and he chewed through the rubber in two days. It is not a really tough plastic for larger, strong jaw dogs."
1,Lasted 5 minutes,Less than 5 minutes after giving this to my 10 month old lab he had chewed through the handle. After reading more this is made for a horse!! LOL Do not buy for a dog because it will not last!!!!
4,My Lab's Favorite Toy,"I know this toy is designed for horses, but my 87 pound 4 year old lab absolutely loves this toy. I mention his weight because I believe he is an average sized lab, far less than ""horse size"". He loves to fetch this toy, and to hold it by the handle and shake it as violently as he can, as if it were prey. I never let him keep the toy, as he would destroy the handle in one session. I have to store it away until the next play. The handle is showing wear even with this vigilance. It will be interesting to see how it wears and how he adapts. Whether I can still use it without a handle, or must throw it out and get a new one. If the latter is the case, I will not hesitate to buy another one, that's how important this toy is for my lab. I withheld the fifth star, as my only recommendation for improvement would toughen up the handle. If that is done, it is definitely five stars to me."
2,"Maybe OK for a horse, don't get for your dog, tho....","The ball has a strong odor, and it isn't peppermint. It is kinda stinky. Our English Mastiff loves large balls to kick around our yard, and she loves the Jolly Balls, but they only last 2-3 days (we've gone thru 3 now) before they are chewed in half. Our Dutch warmblood doesn't like them and his sits in the corner of his stall. If they were studier, it would be better."
4,"Great for the pit, but eventually got destroyed.","The pit mix loved this toy for months. The problem was the handle. When somebody was not throwing it for him, he would lay down and work at eating the handle. One day I was not paying attention and he chewed it off.I would defiantly order another one of these balls. But if you have an extreme chewer, monitor his play time with it."
3,Flung it once,"So far, it just sits in his paddock and I kick it around. Other than the initial introduction, teething and one fling, my yearling colt ignores this ball. He doesn't really get the play thing, perhaps? I'm giving it a 3 star as its probably my colt, not the product. The product seems designed to be fun for a horse to pick up and fling. However, don't expect your horse to like it."
1,Not a fog toy!,Two minutes out of the box and my twenty pound dog had destroyed this ball. He was delighted but I was not!
1,not a toy for a dog,this jolly ball can not be used for a dog it lasted about 5 minutes with mine. i have seen others advertings them to be used with dogs but this one is not one that can be. it was to easy for him to bite threw ive had basketballs hes played with that hes not been able to bite threw. this ball goes flat to easy making a flat surface that is easy to chew holes in. so if considering this for a dog id pass this one by.
5,Awesome for a tough chewer!,"My vizsla has made it his business to destroy every toy that we give him. Its been a month and the jolly ball is still intact. He LOVES it. Wrestling with it and trying to take it everywhere... outside, into his bed, into our bed."
1,not safe for unsupervised play!!,"I bought this toy for my dogs, one of which is 115 lbs. I did buy the one rated for XL dogs, but within 10 minutes my one dog got his teeth stuck in the plastic and couldn't drop the toy without my assistance. A couple minutes later, my other dog got her jaw stuck in the handle (which by her cries, sounds painful), and again needed my assistance. The plastic is not puncture resistant for strong dogs. I've thrown mine in the garbage."
3,Not for Aggressive Chewers,"I was looking for a Jolly Ball that was a little softer to play with inside (the hard plastic version stays outside so my walls and doors aren't smashed to bits) and was hoping this ball would do the trick. My Aussie, Freckles, was EXTREMELY excited when I pulled this Jolly Ball out of the box. Unfortunately, it didn't take long (maybe 5 minutes?) for the corner of the handle to disappear. Then, within a couple of days the whole handle was in little pieces on the living room floor. Once the handle was off, it was obvious Freckes was going to rip the ball to shreds, so I had to throw it away. On the plus side, while it lasted, Freckles really loved this ball. Also, the fact that it holds its shape even when punctured is a plus. I just wouldn't recommend it for an aggressive chewer."
2,Quality Not Consistant,"I have a Heller X who can chew through anything. I order a 10"" JollyBall in January and it became his favorite toy to fetch. It lasted three months before I thought it was time to get him a new one. The second one I ordered was much thinner than the first. He has destroyed it in three weeks. I may get him another but will buy local so I can feel the thickness before purchase."
5,My Border Collie's favorite toy!,"My border collie is a very tough chewer, but he is unable to destroy the HORSE Jolly Ball. He LOVES his ball - plays by himself and with me. The ball is not allowed inside the house, but he keeps trying to bring it in. I also bought the Jolly Egg, which amuses both of us."
4,Fun alternative to the tennis ball!,"(This is our 3rd jolly ball of this size)Big dogs love it--my dalmatian wants to shake it violently back and forth and keeps trying to bite through the handle where it attaches to the ball--so I have to warn him to drop it! The other two carry it properly by the handle. Can be a bit rough when 3 big dogs all go for the same ball. Wears them out faster than chasing the tennis ball. The ball is heavy though (at least to me). I try to throw it, but usually end up kicking it. Keep it put away when not playing with it--it makes it ""special"" and keeps destructive teeth away from it."
5,I Never Get Tired of This,"I first heard this album, before it was an album, when Chris and Thomas did a live set on KCRW. These are two very talented, modest, unassuming musicians who create work on a par with proven giants of the acoustic genre, like Simon & Garfunkel, Cat Stevens, and Neil Young. Chris and Thomas' lyrics never sink to cliche. Take These Thoughts, for example, has a depth and a darkness to it that you'd normally expect from someone like Robert Johnson. You can't go wrong with this CD."
5,Beautiful Way to Enrich Your Spiritual Journey,"This book offers a depth of insight into the life of our Lord and the relationship between Jesus and Mary as well as between Mary and ourselves. It discusses her deep love and devotion to us as our spiritual mother, and how she brings us closer to her Son. This book is life-changing and is a wonderful way to deepen your spirituality and to grow closer to Jesus."
5,A Masterpiece!,"This wonderful little book provides a guide to becoming closer to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, through His Blessed Mother. Contained herein are both explantions as to how and why we can come closer to Divine Intimacy through our Lady and a discipline of devotions to cause this to happen. The writing, though archaic, is timelessly beautiful. And the message could not possibly be more important given the fallen state of our world today. Hail, Mary full of grace!"
2,Confusing.,I found this book very confusing. I am a protestant that has been studying Roman Catholicism for the past couple years. I have read this book to understand Mary. I found this book kind of hard to understand. I understand Mary as an intercessor but this book almost puts her above Jesus. It was informative.
5,"Why love Mary, and how can i love her more perfectly?","This book explains why the Catholic Church loves and is devoted to Mary, the Mother of God. If you already know you love her, than this book will explain how you can take that love ,for the Mother of God, a little deeper in order for her to nuture Christ within us. This book is one that has changed my life and devotion to Mary, the Mother of God, forever and I think one that will change you too."
4,Fans of the origonal will enjoy this one.,"The film takes place a year or two after the first DEMONS movie. After nearly an entire city was wiped out by the demons in the first film, the whole world has become aware of their existence. Mankind was able to defeat the invaders, and now people have gone back to their normal way of life.In an apartment building, people are watching a made-for-T.V. film where some teenagers go to the now deserted and quarentined city where the ghouls first appeared, looking for demon parts. Soon the demons in the film enter the real world and attack the people in the building. Those under seige are people attending a birthday party, attendants at a work-out gym, a girl and her parents, a little boy left home alone, and a young couple expecting a baby.More gore, mayhem and battle scenes won't disapoint veiwers of the origonal. Definetly reccomended for fans of slasher films from the early to mid-1980's."
4,Good for Starters,"Camera work is very important in these videos. This one has the advantage (unlike some others, notably David Carradine's Tai Chi for the Body) of showing you the movements from behind. This is key as it is almost impossible to imitate the form when the instructor faces you....primarily because of the subtlety of the foot movements.The video is comprised of about 20 minutes of stretches, then a single form (Embrace the Moon) demonstrated from the front, side, and back. Both stretches AND the form are extremely beneficial. My lower back pain was nearly eliminated by doing the stretches.Note that the video approaches Tai Chi as a relaxing exercise rather than a workout or a combat technique.On the whole, this is a great way to start learning tai chi."
2,"A little help, here, folks?","This is a very nice video: peaceful, slow, easy to follow, and the movements are explained very well.For about the first 20 minutes of the tape. Then you're on your own, sink or swim - the instruction just stops, and you're expected to follow along on your own, even through brand-new moves!If you're determined, then don't let that stop you - this tape can be followed, with practice, and strict attention. But it can br frustrating in the beginning,especially if you're not used to Tai Chi."
4,Good Introduction to Tai Chi,"This tape is pretty easy to follow, but less specifically instructional. It would be a good addition to a tape that is more technically precise in its teachings.I like the calm voice of the narrator and the outdoor scenes. It is peaceful and relaxing just to watch!"
4,Well built............a wheel lock would make it better,"Really like this product. It came quickly, safely and super easy to set up. If you consider the free shipping it is just a couple of dollars more than the cheapest product without FS.Wheel locks would merit five stars. Be careful when you stand up. I use a rubber door stop I purchased at my hardware store to chock one of the wheels and it works great.. Other than that buy it you will be pleasantly surprised."
2,"Misleading product name - good looking, bad performance",This ATD creeper seat model functions well and looks good. There is nothing hydraulic in it. It is all pneumatic and the same way probably felt the customer that returned it back to the warehouse. So I got the product that was not originally packed. Price was too high for that kind of product condition but I did not want to take extra steps returning it.Review Addition: After about 9 months of light use the plate that holds the seat to piston broke off. It is made of incredibly thin sheet metal (probably to keep the weight down for transportation) that may not withstand the forces when someone is sitting on it. It is a bad construction flaw and I do not recommend purchasing the product.
3,Nice,This is a great garage work-seat. I would have given it 5 starts but the product looks nothing like the picture.
2,ATD Creeper Seat,The product is not hydraulic. It is an air cylinder. Also the covering on the seat is made from some thin brittle plastic that was ripped and cracked right out of the package. It does however function well and is sturdy. With a metal tray. I'm checking on trying to get a partial refund or something to cover the cost of recovering the seat. Or I might just hassel sending it back. It would have been a great seat if not for the seat covering. Look elsewhere unless you are already stuck with it like me..
4,OK release,"im not really happy with this release.theres only like fewer than 10 matches and even though theres 2 disc,they really wasted on it as the 2nd disc has like only a few minutes in it"
4,All Minders to the pit,"It's scripts for Q&C.; You've read the comics, now see how Rucka drafts them.The main draw for me here was more of Steve Rolsten's amazing work.I wouldn't say this book is necessary to the Queen and Country canon, but if you're a huge fan and enjoy looking behind the scenes, it makes a nice edition to the shelf."
4,A Must have for any Rock Fan,If you like the Rock you will love this DVD. There are behind the scens where you see the Rock interact with other WWE stars.
3,Just Bring Me the DVD Extras You Promised!,"Okay, the feature presentation itself is worth 5 stars. It's filled with the rousing promos and hilarious backstage interviews that show why The Rock continues to be, without a shadow of a doubt, thee most electrifying man in sports entertainment, not to mention the greatest smack speaker since Muhammad Ali. There are also exciting match highlights and revealing behind-the-scenes stuff. Now for my in-depth critical analysis: I really want to lay the smackdown on the jabroni who screwed up the special features! The card in the case lists one of the DVD extras as The Rock vs. Rob Van Dam, but it's not in the DVD (I even checked out another DVD to see if it was just a one-time mistake, but it wasn't there either)! If they're going to take away the matchup between my favorite two stars, then I am forced to do the same with the two stars from my review."
1,People actually like this guy!?,"I don't like The Rock, period. He is a jerk.. For so long now, I've still been waiting for the awesome Jonathan Coachman to tell him off (which he failed to do on March 8, 2004 on RAW), and return the favor of 'kicking HIM off the set' for a change.The Rock is ALWAYS a jerk, I feel sorry for Mick Foley being his friend, and I don't understand why the 'millions, AND MILLIONS' of fans actually like him. I mean, WHY?I mean sure, he can talk fast with wits and cunning, he knows when to be nice SOMETIMES, BUT HE HAS AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM. He is one of those grown up football players from high school that's always been mean and for SOME REASON, people actually still like him.I don't respect the Rock, I'm not afraid of him, I punch the TV whenever he's on the set; but feel like shooting it!!He's so mean to his interviewers and people in general that he just pisses me off so much."
5,Sunday Funnies,"All Sherman's the Sharks Books are the best, this one is not except. I would recommend this one and all of them."
3,Delta Faucet,"Would give this 5 stars, but disappointingly, parts of this are plastic. For this price, you wouldn't think so, but it is. Stupid me, I assumed the ""bronze look"" was on metal parts. The appearance is nice, just wish it was all metal parts. I have noticed this seems to be the way with a lot of the newer plumbing fixtures. :[ Also, make sure you have the distance between the shower head and faucet for room for the extended backplate on the hot/cold control. Ours had to go horizontal instead of vertical as pictured."
3,Portability,"What I like best is that I have a wide selection of tools in a portable format which is very convenient. They are not the top of the line tools, but certainly not cheap. The carrying case is very nice. My employer purchased this for me. I would not have paid $190 for it."
2,No genius required to solve this puzzle.,Just a matter of sliding one rod until the notches line up and the next one can be moved and then the next one - so on. It took less than an hour for us to release the disk.
5,Worth Reading Again!!,This book was very easy to read. The story lines stay with the characters. There is just enough detail about the story to know that the setting takes place in Kansas City without going into a lot of detail about the city itself. The author has done a wonderful job of developing the character of Brenda without interjecting a lot of her personality traits into Brenda.I look forward to the author's next book.
5,The Book Takes me back home!,"I just finished ""The Father's Voice."" Being from Kansas, I can relate to the characters and the environment in which the book took place. The character, Brenda (reminds me of my wife in a lot of ways.)I also envy the patients of Russell. I will recommend the book to all of my friends and relatives."
5,A Classic!,"If you only own a few cookbooks make this one of them! I bought this book years ago when I was first learning to make desserts. All sorts of crazes have come and gone since then but these desserts have never gone out of style. I have made Maida's two different chocolate mousse recipes for the same party, and let the guests pick which type they preferred, dense and deeply chocolate or lighter and creamier. Everyone had a preference! The strawberry bavarian is easy to make and a real crowd pleaser, as is the Queen of Sheba Torte. I treasure my old battered and stained copy of this book, and should buy a new copy to hold in reserve. My other absolute favorite dessert book is Classic Home Desserts by Richard Sax."
5,"Don't pass this one by, if you like great desserts","Mrs. Heatter isn't your best known author when it comes to cooking, but her desserts are simply wonderful. She writes in a style that reminds me of Julia Child in her thoroughness. She will give you a tip or two about most recipes, or tell you where they come from. The fare in this book isn't what you would find in the grocery store, but rather these are the wonderful little cakes you might get from an old fashioned bakery. Her instructions are clear, concise, and will not leave you wondering if you are doing this correctly. I would highly recommend any of her books for enlarging your dessert offerings. She will have your guests wondering how you were able to make these delicious desserts."
4,"Great book, great selection of desserts","This is an excelletn book, full of the best desserts, and of course the best recipes I've tried many recipes and everything have came deicious, only one pound cake wasn't really great but all the other things came out great.The brownies are awesome, the Budapest Coffee Cake too, and other recipes were really good too.I think that is important to have it if you love to bake as me and if you love desserst as much as I love them, you will find many recipes (seriously I mean lots of dessert recipes) you will have a huge selection to choose the perfect one for each ocassion, and every recipe is tested by a queen of baking, Maida Heatter, go ahead buy this book try many recipes you will see great results and you will be happy with the final results."
3,A little overrated,"Comparing to James McNair's recipes this book just does not cut the mustard, so to speak. It was not as userfriendly as other recipe books that I have found, such as the Neiman Marcus cookbook. But then again, for those who have followed Ms. Heatter for years may indeed like this book."
2,Disappointed...,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this huge book but was disappointed when it arrived by the fact that there are no photos! How do you know that you are making something correctly if you don't have a reference point? Granted, the recipes may be fine but I have yet to spend anytime with this book. It has been sitting on my counter for weeks and is the least interesting of my cookbooks just because it doesn't provide any visual aids."
5,It doesn't get better than this,I have been baking for 60 years and have amassed a huge collection of recipes and nothingsurpasses this one. One can say this or that about a book like this but it all boils down towhether or not the recipes work. I can say without reservation that every recipe I have tried so far works beautifully. What more could one want?
4,I'm mad about Maida,"The recipes are easy enough for me, a cook that I self rate a six on a scale of 10. She makes food even better. I am mad about Maida."
5,Great Card with Xtrememimo Router,"The router and the card work well together. I don't know if it would be the same with any other router but all is well here. That router is super powerful too, my neighbor gets my internet (with my permission of course) and doesnt lose connection."
2,A bit disappointed,"I waited patiently to receiving this CD collection of all Paganini's concertos anticipating the outstanding performance praised in most of the reviews. The outcome was a bit disappointing. The disappointment is limited though to the performance of Concerto No. 1, and especially the Rondo (third movement). Paganini is indeed very challenging and requires the performer to add their own ""interpretation and feelings"" to it. The way Accardo plays Concerto No. 1 is very close to what a synthesizer would do (well, exaggerating), purely technical, no feelings at all. I must however state that the other Concertos show substantial improvement and deserve the praise expressed in the other reviews. For concerto no.1 I would recommend Hilary Hahn's performance which is truly perfect."
3,Okay but Skip Rogers sometimes doesn't know what he's doing.,"This video reviews five games. Mega Man 2, Platoon, Top Gun, Wizards and Warriors and Metal Gear. While he does give some help on the last two games, sometimes he doesn't know what to do. In MM2 for Wood Man he says ""Don't use the metal blade."" which is wrong. He makes a mistake on the other tape too. On Double Dragon in mission 3, he says ""Don't take the trolley instead go deeper down."" That's wrong too. You MUST take the trolley. Otherwise these two videos are good for a few laughs and some tips."
2,"Too much ""common sense"" not enough meat&#65533;","I am very interested in learning about this subject and I was disappointed by this book. Mr. Gambetta knows the subject but in the book he was happy with explaining that there is something called ""functional tanning"" that could benefit athletes.There is too much ""technical lingo"" that makes the book boring. At the end of the book, you won't be able to make a functional program at all so what's the objective of the book? Sell the idea? Get you to hired Mr. Gambetta?"
5,tight Jams on here,Bobby Brown was cool back in the day.I still groove to His Older Jams.Brother man should still be having a Career to this Day.all the Classic Bobby Brown Jams are on here.the Brother was Badd back in the day.
5,TCU shirt bought by a BAMA fan!,My 12 year old grandson likes TCUso I surprised him with this shirtand he nearly lives in it. Sofar it has washed well and withstoodlots of wearing by a very activepre-teen. Will order from thisvendor again.
4,Two great tastes...,"... That don't go together.I really enjoyed the Philip Glass, but I think the Schnittke takes a more refined ear than I have. To me, it sounded atonal and disjointed, which I suppose, was the whole point."
3,GREAT ARTIST - QUESTIONABLE SELECTIONS,"I can't believe that ""FIRST WE TAKE MANHATTAN"" is not on a ""BEST OF COHEN"". I would also rather hear the studio versions over the live. My advice instead is to buy ""I'M YOUR MAN"" and if you like that get ""THE FUTURE"". His newest cd is very good too. Mr. Cohen releases albums so rarely that 3 CDs in 13 years is not that much of an investment. If you want a good live tape I would seek out his PBS Austin City Limits video."
4,Some songs are quite awesome,"Especially ""Everybody Knows"" ""Tower of Song"". ""Dance me to the end of love"" is great,but I'd have preferred the studio version to the live version presented here. About half the songs do nothing for me. But this is a good way to get some great recent songs of Leonard Cohen without having to buy each of his later CDs. which have a tendency to contain just one great song the rest being so-so."
3,Hallelujah,Leonard Cohen is a great song writer partly because he's a very good poet. Unfortunately his rendition of Hallelujah on this CD omits many of the juicy words of what I perceive to be the original song/poem.
3,Secular Hallelujah Lyrics,"The version of Hallelujah on this CD does not contain the verses with reference to King David. Those verses are replaced by more secular verses. When I listened I was surprised that the lyrics were not as I expected. After a bit of Web research I discovered that there were indeed different versions of the song released. If it were up to me I would have chosen the original version as a ""best of"" selection."
5,Jeff Buckley fans beware,"Though Leonard Cohen is definitely a lyrical and poetic genius, I hope no customers are swayed to buy this CD because of Jeff Buckley's brilliant cover of ""Hallelujah"". If you are expecting to find Buckley's sound in Cohen's work, your new purchase may be a bitter pill for you to swallow. I must admit that Cohen's lyrics are some of the most powerful and magical words I have ever heard uttered. This is where the 5 stars come in. For those that were moved greatly by Buckley's rendition of ""Hallelujah"", I recommend Leonard Cohen's lyrics, poetry, and literature."
5,PIZZA ANYWAY YOU LIKE IT,searched book in local locality to lower shipping expensivefound a local seller on amazonbook was sold as used.i received it in great condition. ''almost new''from order date it took 2 days receiving it.the packaging was very professional.I REALIZED A $20. SAVINGS BUYING ''USED''.
5,Superb!,"The first thing I learned is that a pizza can also be simple. The Neapolitan dough recipe is excellent and executable, but the possibilities for topping it are endless both in the direction of complexity as well as simplicity. The entire spectrum is covered with professional insight, plenty of tips, interesting cultural and historical notes, and concision. A perfect treatise on the subject which makes a perfect cookbook as well. Mastery becomes possible to the point that innovation is acquired. Get it!"
4,Playful tent,"I ordered this product for my son's birthday party and for the sheer intrigue he has for space. My rating is in the mid-range due to my frustration with the delivery/ordering process. I am also a little disappointed that the tent is not able to be used outside. I am aware of the specified use as a play tent, but was disappointed that it cannot be used for outside use. The openings for entrance and exit are holes and cannot be zipped. My son would definetly rate this a 5. It has been great entertainment for him. Not only that, but he has had several ""camp-outs"" in his room with his sisters and friends. If you are strictly looking for a play tent, this is well worth the $. It paided for itself at the party. I would say that it was better than the popular air jumpy things. The possibilities for games and activites are endless. Enjoy!!!"
5,A Dreamer's Paradise,"This is the second year I have had this calendar hanging on my kitchen wall. One day I will have a home with a great old porch on it, until then I can dream, can't I?"
3,Basically a Compilation,"QUickly thrown together to take advantage of BoA's sudden popularity in Korea and Japan.This is an ok cd.Most of these tracks are really second rate throw outs from Peace B,and English versions of her songs."
4,a melodic melody :),"this cd is pretty kewl, the whole thing is listenable, with sweet melodies and catchy lyrics. although at first i was annoyed that female singer seems to predominate over the guy's vocal, unlike some of their other stuff, it eventually grew on me, and now i couldn't imagine their music any other way. hmm...someone before mentioned that track 4 was a weakness, but thats actually my fave track, it just a beautiful song. happy listening!"
1,Busted,"Guess I should have known not to order 36' light bulbs on line and expected to recieve theme in one piece, I know better now! No prob , Still Love Ya Amazon!!!"
5,Navy Blue Shorts,I was totally satisfied! I highly recommend this seller. The shorts were great & they arrived super-fast.
4,Comfortable for lounging,"Just as advertised, comfortable for lounging around the house in. If I did it over, I would get a version with pockets."
2,No Pockets,"Upon receiving these shorts, I was disappointed to find that they have no pockets. The website description didn't mention pockets at all, so i assumed they were there."
4,Comfort that is Champion,Champion jersey shorts are very nice and cool. The shorts are good for working out or relaxing at home.
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I loved this book! I read it in a matter of hours. The information in the book is very accurate. It describes life in a fast paced culinary kitchen. It talks about different aspects and roles in the kitchen. I really enjoyed reading it. Some of what was in the book is what I'm currently studying in Culinary School. Some information will be discussed in later classes and from reading this book, I already know some of what we'll be discussing. For anyone in the Culinary Profession or in Culinary School, I would definitely suggest Letters To A Young Chef as a must read."
5,Insightfully clever,Left/Right is quintessentially brilliant - This insightfully clever film embraces the essence of choice and action....all with a taste of mad humor that leaves you wondering if you should even be laughing. The inventive storyline coupled with the stellar production work will make you question why these cats didn't begin their film-making career sooner.
5,stunning,"I'm not kidding when I say this book has changed my life. Visually stunning, unimaginably beautiful."
3,The online description versus customer comments,The following is Amazon's description of this book:Paperback: 139 pagesPublisher: Prestel Publishing (August 1998)Language: EnglishISBN-10: 3791319906ISBN-13: 978-3791319902Product Dimensions: 12.3 x 9.4 x 0.5 inchesShipping Weight: 1.8 poundsMore than one customer review states that they received a book that is only 3 inches wide. I hesitate to buy this book since the info posted may be misleading.
3,OK printing of a beautiful artist's work,"Haeckel's paintings are exceptional, but the colors in this collection are a little flat. They skimp on color and don't do full justice to the vibrant, vivid colors of Haeckel's organisms. Compared to other prints, this is rather disappointing, but still a decent collection of his best work at a reasonable price."
5,The Flash was a great TV series.,"The DC Comics superhero The Flash had his own one hour, live action TV series on the CBS network during the 1990-'91 television season. Although only lasting the one season, The Flash was a great TV series that should have been on longer than it was. This tape features the pilot episode which was just well made with solid storytelling and just excellent special FX. I saw this show during its run on CBS and I still miss it. CBS should have given this series a chance back then."
4,Great Movie--Especially for comic book buffs,"This is the first episode of one of my favorite TV series. It came out after the highly successful first Batman movie, which you can tell some of the similarities between the 2 (like the flash symbol against the backdrop of the moon). This is one television show I wish they would at least bring back in reruns, I never got to see all the episodes and would like to add them to my video collection. Anyway, if you liked the first Batman movie better than the rest, or are looking for a good adaptation of a comic book hero, you want to get this movie!"
3,"Great superheroic action, if just a little repetitious.","While I thought it was excellent if you are into the Flash, some of the ""superspeed"" seemed to take a little long. The blend of action and drama is very good though, and even though I only would give this 3 stars, it was entertaining and that's the main guide I use to determine if something is worth watching."
5,DVD,"...This was a Fantastic Movie and a Fantastic series, and only a fool wouldn't buy the collection. I wish I had the ability and I would release it myself. (And get very rich). The flash is a great DC Hero and it's a real pity this movie and series is being neglected by the DVD world. It's also a pity that the series had to end. i can't believe more people aren't calling for the return of this series. What is the matter with the world...Go Flash Go."
2,Sleepwalking through Wagner,Levine's conducting of Wagner is ponderous and without enthusiasm.Listening to this album reminds one of walking in very heavy boots through a field of thick mud. Wagner for the narcoleptic.
3,"Stingy timing, average performances","This rather stingily filled CD (at 60 min. they could easily have given us the Prelude to Act I of Lohengrin, not just to Act III) finds Levine in his familiar role as a baffling Wagner conductor. I have heard him live quite often, to thrilling effect in the Ring, Meistersinger, Tristan, and the Flying Dutchman. But he has consistently let me down on disc. Here we get lackluster, often slack readings of Wagner chestnuts. No single performance stands out in any way, although the Rienzi is especially dull. I think if Levine remade this recording today instead of in 1991 we would hear more incisive, committed performances. The orchestra nad recording are fine, although one can't honestly say that this ensemble sounds the equal of the best European philharmonics. All in all, this one is missable."
3,Bad packaging,Product arrived loose in large box free to bounce around which it did in transit. Arrived bent all out of shape. Was able to straighten it out enough for use and figured it was too much hassle to return so decided to live with it. Product as advertised but packing was sorry.
5,Human potential from cosmic perspective.,"For a trip to a desert island - this is the only book I would take.Every sentence has a depth of meaning.It is a potent companion to a question ""Who am I?"""
1,Don't even think to buy this crap,"This book... if it is a book, is a awfull thing. Like the title, it contains one tousand questions over international law.... not even 5 dollars worth."
5,The are real ghost stories from real people,"This book was receommended to me by a friend and I am glad that I gave it a shot. The stories here are realistic even though they are quite strange and about a mysterious world that many of us never give a second thought about. I thought the story about his grandmother calling on the phone was creepy but very heartwarming too. But there are pages after pages of similar events retold by his friends and family. I never thought there were ghosts in Texas because you never hear about them that much. New England is always full of weird stuff, but I was surprised how much happens in Texas too. Well written."
5,Boo!,"SPIRITS OF TEXAS AND NEW ENGLAND reads like good conversation! De Los Santos enters the realm of the paranormal with an absorbing collection of real-life stories that make readers feel as if they are sitting listening to an exceptional storyteller. The stories retold by De Los Santos are engaging and full of truthful twists of human nature and show that when in the face of the paranormal, we often become quivering masses of uncertainty. In addition, these stories demonstrate that regardless of time, gender and geography or the circumstances of contact with the supernatural, people's experiences of being human are very much alike. The family members provide some of the liveliest and most vivid stories and De Los Santos includes helpful explanations of paranormal activity. He's a writer with insight and scope."
2,Noticeably Incomplete,"Seems to me that a ""Very Best"" comp of Japan can NOT miss Adolescent Sex and Communist China or In Vogue. Was this comp song list put together by someone unfamiliar with their catalog?"
5,I love Japan,"This album is fantastic, but where is the song Swing? I love that song! My favorites are All Tomorrow's Parties, Methods of Dance, I Second That Emotion, European Son and my all favorite is Gentlemen Take Polaroids. It could have used Adolescent Sex, even though the band was ""embarassed"" by their older image. They are an awesome band. David Sylvian and Mick Karn were musical geniuses, in Japan and solo. David's voice is so great and smooth, and Mick Karns basslines pop and buzz (I'm a total sucker for bass ever since I heard Duran Duran's Rio). If you are considering this, I would definitely buy it! I got it for Christmas this year and I love it."
2,"Alban Berg: Violin Concerto ""To the Memory of an Angel"" (1935) / Wolfgang Rihm: ""Time Chant"" Music for Violin & Orchestra (1991-","Alban Berg: Violin Concerto ""To the Memory of an Angel"" (1935) / Wolfgang Rihm: ""Time Chant"" Music for Violin & Orchestra (1991-92) - Anne-Sophie Mutter is a 1992 Deutsche Grammophon recording starring violinist Ann-Sophie Mutter. James Levine leads the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Wolfgang Rihm has written the music notes. This sound is very modern and feels more like noise rather then music. Not recommended. 2/5."
3,It seems like it'd be cool.,"Well, the instructions for solving it are printed on the packaging cardboard. But it's very small and faint, hard to really be sure of what exactly they mean in each step. Then a few days after i had it one of the ropes came unglued from a wooden block. You decide."
3,Don't forget the crackers!,"Don't forget the crackers when you watch this cheese-fest! The music is very good--they do a quite capable job. The visuals are rather melodramatic. The movie has a very ""made in the 70's"" vibe. I just watched this less than a month ago and I already cannot remember the visuals that well. They are that forgettable. The music is rock steady though. It's a bit of a stretch to take Beatles songs and make them into a political movie. Watch this once and then make a tape of the soundtrack. That's the real highlight anyway.And don't forget the crackers."
1,EXTREMELY boring.,"Claudia and the Lighthouse is one of the worst mysteries I have ever read in my whole life. It was stupid, boring and not the least bit suspensful. It's not even worth reading on a rainy day."
4,"see them live, too!","If you liked what you sampled of Bat For Lashes, and lead singer/songwriter Natasha Khan, then I urge you to see them play live, if you ever get the chance. We saw them a few years ago, when they played at a local venue. My brother insisted we go; he drove 400 miles to join us there! I had not even heard of them before, so I was in for a treat. Their performance was true magic. I mean it: with her costumes, makeup, moves and mystical power staff (not to mention the music itself), Ms. Khan casts a shammanistic spell."
4,Fur And Gold,Bat for Lashes is a fantastic artist/band. It's difficult to draw comparisons of other artists. I would say that her live stuff is much better (check out Daniel on Later with Jools Holland) but this album is still very good.
5,Fantastic debut,"I wont go into details about the album because this should be experienced without knowing much but its very simple, If you love artists like Kate Bush or CocoRosie then buy this now!"
3,"BAT FOR LASHES - ""Fur & Gold""","I heard this group on KCRW in Los Angeles and they were fabulous so I ordered both of their albums only to find that they were over produced and didn't have nearly the energy that I heard in that live radio performance. If only I could have that KCRW set on CD! Anyway, in my haste to order the first two albums I evidently didn't separate my orders between two sources and ended up getting two of ""Fur & Gold"" from Smogtown Records when I only wanted one. Amazon said simply send the extra back for credit. Well, I'm so lazy I haven't gotten around to filling out the form, sealing the envelope and mailing it. I'm thinking maybe I can find another fan and give them my extra copy. It just isn't worth the trouble to send something back. That said, I couldn't have been more happy with the condition of the CD's or the prompt reception of my order."
2,A Perplexing Adventure,The contents of this album are as baffling as the name of the featured vocalist. Odd drumming and ghostly vocals pervade the tracks which are largely plodding and uninvolving. Sounds like some American Indian drug trip as experienced by an alt engenue. Interesting but skippable.
5,Into the Deep by Colleen Coble,"This book was purchased as a gift for my grandaughter and it arrived on time and in excellent condition. I have read the book myself and I would recommend it to all Christian readers. Thank you, Phyllis Lautenschlaeger"
2,Lame & Lazy DVD!!,"Just so you know you do NOT get the first four KOTM, you get the Last 3. This DVD was very Lazy in being put together. NO Match Listing (Package, Inside DVD or Website for that matter), No Intro (DVD just starts, I thought my player skipped a section), Normal ""Same Old"",Same Old"" Interviews (ok, but nothing worth noting) and the Matches ALL (except KOTM 2008) that we have seen before a dozen times on other DVD packages. No Terrodome as promised and No X-Division Lockdown Match as anticipated!! VERY LAME & VERY LAZY TNA Release!!!After the Great Knockouts DVD I thought TNA was ready to set the bar agian but then they go and release this garbage. It is not that the Matches are bad, far from it, it's just that we have seen ALL these matches SOOOOO Many Times before, WE WANT SOMETHING NEW!! Total Lazyness on TNA's Part and Nothing More Than a Quick Cash In!!!"
1,Good DVD still sitting in a wharehouse,Sleepers is a good DVD. I purchased it off Overman 2000 last June but it still hasn't reached in August. Overman informs me that it was sent by US Media Mail and even forwarded me a note from the USPS on July 28th that recoreds its arrival at an Illinois wharehouse on July 1st. There are no signs of further movement. Have notified Amazon and contacted Overman on several occasions.
4,The past revisited,"Having known the author during our high school days and not hearing of him again until our 50th high school reunion, it is difficult for me to relate that kid with the accomplished man of today. Just goes to show that one doesn't have to be captain of the football team or a high scoring basketball player to lead an interesting and successful life out in the ""real world"". This book, a collection of short stories, demonstrates that truth.Also, it's one of those books that can be categorized as a ""great vacation or cruise book"" as all the stories are self-contained (meaning you're never late for the next meal). I liked it."
3,Good hardware poor user interface,"I was wondering why ipods commanded such premium prices until I got a Creative Nano 1GB. I like its small size and the sound quality is satisfactory. I intended to use it to listen to books ripped from cds. So each book should be a directory under which there are directories for the disks. Under each disk directory there are tracks. This is no sweat for ipod to handle but stretches the Creative's ability since it does not really understand the concept of directory trees. Well, it pretends to understand one flat layer of directories but I can tell it is faking that, being a computer programmer myself. As the result, strange things happen when you actually have layers of directories. Although I have figured out how to cope in some cases, I wish I had got an ipod instead. So if you just want to play some songs this is good enough but if you want any organization of the content, ipod is a better choice."
1,Doesn't last long,"I received this item for Christmas last year. I loved it! It was a good MP3 player for the money.Then, last week I went to use it and the sound was all distorted. I went to the Zen website to troubleshoot it and went to try their suggestions but whenever I connected the Zen to my computer, the computer locked up. As soon as I removed the Zen from the computer, it was fine. So, I was unable to troubleshoot. So I tried to turn on my Zen to check settings. Now it won't even turn on. I went back to the Zen website to contact Customer service. They wanted me to pay a nonrefundable $25 just to get a return number, with no guarantees that they could fix the problem. There was no phone number to contact them, or anyway to contact them via email. When a company makes themselves inaccessible like that, I have to wonder why. Don't settle for the Zen."
2,Good for kids,"I got this unit and was surprised that it only allows you to skip through the songs forward and backwards. I might have missed some other options, but I don't think so. I got this for a 10 year old and she doesn't seem to mind, but if you are looking for the ability to play songs by artist, album, or any other grouping, I could not figure out how to do it.It works well other than that. It's basically a thumb drive and you can drag and drop (cut and paste) songs on here easily.It comes with a rubber case to help protect it, ok head phones and a USB cord. My XP found it and installed it quickly with any additional software. It does come with software, but I didn't even look at it.If you want something more intelligent, then the one gig Sandisk with the 1 gig memory slot works very well, for under $100.[...]"
1,digital readout too small to read,"I BOUGHT THIS UNIT BECAUSE IT WOULD RECORD CASSETTES AND CDS. HOWEVER, THE DIGITAL READOUT WAS SO SMALL, I COULD NOT READ IT. I PUT A MAGNIFYING CLASS ON IT, AND IT WAS STILL TOO SMALL. YOU CAN'T HOLD A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND THE MP3 AT THE SAME TIME. THE SCROLLER WAS DIFFICULT TO WORK.THANKS AMAZON FOR TAKING THIS PRODUCT BACK THAT I COULDN'T USE.JAY KING"
5,worth every penny,"I bought this for my 12 year old son, he started to use it without reading the instructions within a few minutes. He is just a regular kid, but the device is so easy to operate he did not need to read the instrcutions. (I told him to read it anyway to get the full benefit of the device) He said it is way better than his friends ipod. I recommend it to everyone."
4,Great - but NO NAPSTER-TO-GO COMPATIBILITY,"This is a very good deal for the money. Everything comes in the box, ready to go. You get a decent armband and it has a radio function. Includes a halfway decent skin and earphones...even the first battery. I love it - except for my situation. I bought it for my wife's birthday, thinking I could add her onto my subscription through Napster-to-go. WRONG! It doesn't have that capability. It has great sound, and the functions are easily interpreted, so it's great for all of it's other functions, just not the one I bought it for. It DOES work with Napster, just not the subscription portion. Since it was advertised that way, I kind of felt that Creative was deceptive, but it's my fault for not going to the next level of reasoning I guess. Anyway, great product for all other functions. Nuff said."
4,Good Quality at a Reasonable Price,"This very compact player gives good quality sound and is relatively easy to use. The printed instructions are kind of sparse, but the instructions on the software make up for this and are very complete. The scroller control takes a little practice to get use to, since you are using combinations of pressing and scrolling on the same control. Once you've mastered it, it's a breeze."
4,Great MP3 player compared to Ipod Shuffle,"I switched from an Ipod Shuffle (the first generation that looks like a stick) to this MP3 player and am very impressed. For the price, this player has many things the shuffle doesn't including a higher memory and an on screen display of the current song you are listening to. Although you cannot select specific playlists this doesn't bother me because I couldn't do that with a shuffle either. As far as size, sound and ease of functions I would say its about equal to an Ipod shuffle. I love that I can see the song I'm listening to and that it can hold way more songs, this makes it better than the shuffle in my opinion. Biggest drawback: batteries. I use it everyday and the one AAA battery only lasts me about 2 weeks, I suppose if I got rechargables I could diminsh this cost a bit."
3,Does NOT SUPPORT PlaysForSure Subscription services!,"Just a quick warning: the description is misleading. While this player DOES support PlaysForSure DOWNLOADS, it does NOT support PlaysForSure subscription services like Yahoo Music..."
4,Pretty cool,"When I got this I was surprised how small it was. It was east to copy music from my computer and it plays pretty good. Make sure though that you always have the best electronic batteries available, they do go bad pretty fast. I used this on my trip that was 8 hours long and it was nice. Music plays pretty well too. For the price, it was well worth it. Not to costly."
2,Voice recorder sucks,"The tracks have a tic that repeats every second, i.e. all voice recordings have a tic tic tic tic in the background."
2,Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3 Player (Blue),"This mp3 player has good features but with little instructions provided, it is nearly impossible to use. So far, we have only been able to download a few songs and those were songs already on my computer and has not allowed us to download purchased songs yet.The buttons are also a challenge to use. I still haven't figured them out and given the time involved in doing so I probably never will.I am disappointed in the ease of use for this product."
1,Cheep But Good,I Broke the battery door off right away however i did pick up a role of duck tape for only 2 dollars at walmart this fixed the problem right away. and hay im spending 50 dollars on a mp3 player i expect it to be junk but this is the best junk for the money. i recomend it to all my friends to cheap to buy an ipod.
2,Installation Disc is a big problem,"The installation disc messed up my Window XP. I had to use my friend's computer to load music to the player. Those of you who use Window XP-home edition, don't bother with the included disc. Use WMP 11 to load music. The player is so-so, but the battery life is far shorter than advertised."
4,Review of Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3 Player,"I have had my player for a couple of weeks. I am very pleased with the sound quality and performance. The earbuds are useless if your are walking, jogging or working out, they continually fall out of my ears. I Purchased Sony's MDR-J10 earbuds (in a matching color) that clip over the ears. I think the earbuds on the Sony model will stay in place. Order player and Sony earbuds on-line total package $66 to my door. June 23, 2007."
1,super bad warranty and garbage product,"I owned this device for 5 months and it just stopped working... I went though all the proper channels for repair and was told they want at least $25.00 to ""work"" on my warranty repair. It turns out only parts are covered for a year and labor only for 3 months. This is NOT what I call standing behind your product.DON'T BUY CREATIVE PRODUCTS! Not only are they poorly made, but Creative knows this and doesn't stand behind their own products."
4,Love this!,"I love this little MP3 player!!! It is the only one I have ever had and that is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars (I have nothing to compare it to). It is very simple to use and it uses just one AAA battery. I also purchased rechargeable AAA batteries and a charger so I don't have to keep buying AAA batteries. This MP3 player is very small and has great sound. I did purchase Sony earphones instead of using the ones that came with this MP3 player. The ones that come with it are OK, but I wanted something with better sound quality. Overall, this MP3 player is a great buy and much less expensive than the iPod. Definitely worth the money. I am very happy about this purchase."
4,Great player,I am very happy with this player. I found it very easy to transfer music from my pc and find it on the player. I definitely recommend this item!
5,wash and wear,"I bought this about 18 months ago and have never have had any complaints. Writing a review this morning because yesterday I accidently put it throught the washer and dryer, when I found it in my pants pocket this morning it fired right up and works fine (after replacing the battery). Try that with a freakin iPod. Keep it in the rubber sleeve that comes with it and it's almost indestructible."
3,MP3 for Seniors,I got this MP3 player for my 75th birthday and needed a lot of help to put music on it. Directions are very limited. We still cannot figure out if there is a way to take songs off if we no longer want them. All in all the quality is good and it has me out walking 3 miles again so it was a good buy.
1,Poor Quality,"Returned after about 3 weeks. Nano Plus locked up and tech support confirmed the item was defective. They do not make Creative Labs products like they used to! I have several older Creative Labs MP3 players that still work fine. They used to make great products, NOW, in my opinion, cheaply made and sub-standard."
4,Almost 5 Stars - No IPOD needed :),"This item is a crowd pleaser... We set up the Zen Nano, quickly transferred music onto it, plugged it into external speakers and were shocked by the quality.... Audible quality is great. We played a song by Sting that we never realized had very faint instrumentals in the beginning of the song - but it could be heard on the Zen. Digital display is clear, you can scan to the songs that you want to hear, when you power off and on, the music starts where you left off and did I mention the quality is great :) We just downloaded 6 cds worth of music onto the Zen, and most of the free disk space is still available.The ONLY reason it did not receive 5 stars is battery replacement. My husband uses the Zen on long commutes, so it seems the batteries are being replaced 2 times per week (AAA batteries I believe). But I imagine more selective use would result in the batteries lasting longer."
4,SIMPLE ENOUGH FOR NON-TECHIES,"I'VE HAD MY 1 GIG ZEN NANO PLUS FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW AND LOVE IT. UNLIKE OTHER REVIEWERS , MUSIC WAS NOT MY FOCUS. I WANTED TO DOWNLOAD AUDIOBOOKS. IT IS GREAT FOR THAT APPLICATION. ONCE YOU FIGURE IT OUT (the instructions are not helpfull) THEN IT IS EASY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE MENUS. IT HOLDS ALOT. I'VE HAD 3 LARGE NOVELS LOADED ON AT ONE TIME WITH MORE SPACE AVAILABLE. THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT RATE IT 5 STARS WAS BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SCREEN. WITH THIS ONE YOU HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH.PROS: EASY TO USE, SMALL, GREAT SOUND QUALITY, EASY BATTERY CHANGES, LOTS OF SPACE, POWERFUL RADIO SIGNALCONS: SMALL SCREEN-MORE OF A HEADACHE IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE AUDIO BOOK.AWESOME FIRST MP3"
4,Pretty decent.,"The headphones are great sound wise, the fm tuner is great,and you could download music for it in your sleep its so easy. The encoding from the stereo is like a voice recording other than the fact that its a different format, so its not really downloading.The battery lasts a long time as long as you get a good brand, and the player is excellent!"
4,Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3 Player,"This Nano is, basically, a good value. It holds a lot of songs and is very easy to use. It has the capability to record voice messages and listen to FM radio in addition to downloaded songs. The ""case integrity"" is poor. The battery cover broke the first time I put batteries in. Duct tape now holds it in place. The ear ""buds"" that were included were W-A-Y too big to fit in my ears, so it cost an extra $25 for new headphones."
4,"***Versatile, easy to use, tuner and voice recorder also!***","I Bought this unit a few years ago, when I went to buy it, I was actually looking for a portable CD player which can play mp3 CD's. I couldn't find one at a big electronics retailer so I called one of my younger friends who told me that I could get a flash player. I'm glad I got this unit. It weighs almost nothing, holds a few hundred songs, very easy to load onto, being picked up by my laptop as an external drive. One really neat thing I do is I record using the record function, put it on my computer and burn a CD or send the wav file via email. Very cool! I think an Ipod may be better but I don't like the fact you MUST use itunes for the ipod. I like this piece. I am very picky with electronics and recommend this if you need something simple and versatile. Battery life's pretty good, a week listening every day on my daily commute to and from work. Love the indigo light, definately, consider it."
4,"pretty good for when it was introduced, there's better choices now","just FYI, i bought this more than a year ago+vessound quality - excellentnavigation - sensibleFM reception - niceloads of featuressize and looks - compact & i think looks cool-vesdoesn't play wav files, tho it says wav is supporteddoesn't support wma lossless or wma prowma files take more battery life, and high bitrate files take huge battery life, which is bad for audiophilesother pointsmic is very receptive, so if u're singing, then don't hold it too close or u'll distortoverallfeature-packed and bang-for-the-buck, but file format support leaves a lot to desire.there's better choices now, some that don't require a cable for USB.also, most standard multimedia cellphones (costing <$200) offer all these features, so what's the need for a separate gadget for that?"
3,Decent,"I own it from last 1 years. I use it only while commuting to my office (not a heavy user), but overall a decent product. Good sound quality and lots of features like voice recording, FM recording, good battery life. I bought it when not too many cell phone had mp3 capabilities. After arrival of cell phones with same features/capabilities, this product is kinda unnecessary."
4,Nice for working out!,"This is the first mp3 player I have owned; I was looking for something small that I could clip on and work out with. I found that the Zen Nano Plus was perfect for that. The controls are fairly easy to use once you get the hang of them. The sound is good, though I found that the included earbuds were too large for me."
5,"well built, twice as many functions as assumed, no flaws","has equalizer built in, mic recording capability, folders for organization, fm radio, mp3 encoding, lock, and on and on all with a very competative price."
2,...,"to the one guy who made the comment about My Chemical Romance;MCR is better then HH will EVER be. That I can promise you.Only good song on here is Silver Bullet. Meh, I'm angry that I bought this CD now that I think about it."
1,My one wish,"Look, I'm just gonna lay it out for you, as simple in terms as I can possible muster:If you keep supporting this dreck then it will continue to get made.Now that ladies and gents is a threat. Hawthorne Heights are easily one of the five worst bands currently making music. This may seem like an overstatement, but with the possible exception of My Chemical Romance I can't think of any ""rock"" group that makes my head hurt as much as Hawthorne Heights.This whole ""my girlfriend broke up with me and now I'm MAD!!!"" form of music that's been making the rounds for the last few years was irksome three years ago. Now it's just intolerable.So look, if you don't buy this record, which features numerous rendentions of the same crappy song played over and over and over again, not unlike their peers, then bands like this will cease to exist. And that is something that I honestly pray for.Please support me in my cause."
1,Of My God!!!!!!,"Awful. it's all bad here. Music for 12 year old girls. I might have given it a 2 if it wern't for that terrible stupid guy who comes in screaming to every single song. Terrible! how is this band even cutting record deals? Not punk rock, and in my opinion not music. Awful. God I hate it. Nothing good here.DON;T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!WOW.WHAT A STUPID CD"
5,Completely underated,"If you like band that are not mainstream than you are just like me and deserve to hear these guys. Without any doubt the best rock album of 2004. Hawthorne Heights delivers every thing you could ask for in agreat band and more. Originality, sound,lyrics that blo you away. No matter what people say here, The silence in Black and White is the best album of 2004, not American Idiot. The worst song on this album is probably Niki FM and it's still really good. My personal favorites are The Transition and Life on Standby. However I really like Dissolve and Decay nad Ohio Is For Lovers as well. This album is getting bad reveiws souly because people don't respect what Hawthorne Heights is trying to do here, which is find a balabce between punk and screamo. In my opinion they have found it and played it perfectly. trust me, if you like bands like Silverstein, Taking Back Sunday and The Used, you will like Hawthorne Heights."
2,Nothing Special,"In the clutter of pop-punk/emo bands in the world today, Hawthorne Heights brings nothing new to anything. Been done before, and the sound feels like as much. Maybe a few decent tracks, but unless you really like this type of music, it's probably not for you."
1,Generic and boring!!,"The Silence in black and white is horrible. You hear ""Ohio is for Lovers"" and you think, it's just a single, there must be better songs on the cd. But no. Ohio is the best song, and the rest are all slow paced and boring. The silence in black and white is just that, black and white. No color to it, no originality, and the screamer sounds like he's constipated. And the lyrics just plain suck. Emo bands are supposed to write about heartache that they have been through. And obviously none of them have cut their wrists or blacked their eyes, because they are (unfortunately) still with us today. And that whole radio thing's not original either, listen to any other emo cd."
2,Not very good...but could be worse...,"I first found these guys here on Amazon when I was looking for ""Thrice."" Unfortunatly, this band isn't the greatest new band to come to ""Emo"" or whatever the heck you wanna call it. But hey, they could be worse...they be very monotonous like the bands Lifehouse, Silverstein or Matchbook Romance...This CD isn't very innovative...I personally only like 4 songs on the thing. (Tracks 5-9) The lyrics aren't very poetic. They sound like a blended up ""Goth Kid"" journal. The lead singer's voice sounds like he's singing the same 3 high pitches over and over again, so even the songs you may like get boring fast...My favorite song is, of course, ""Ohio is for Lovers"" but I don't see what Ohio has to do with it...haha...The band sounds fine live, they aren't fun or exciting...They aren't that groundbreaking musically...Basically they're boring and they suck...maybe if they got a male singer with a low voice and actually developed harmony, they wouldn't be as bland...hmmm"
1,cliiiiiiiche,"hawthorne heights are a cookie cutter band. they sound like 239847237 other bands that claim to be ""screamo."" they are nowhere near hardcore. if you want to listen to some good screamo, listen to Beloved. and if you want some hardcore, try As I Lay Dying."
3,I'd buy it,I'd buy it. It's not one of my favorites but I'd recommend it to anyone that likes this genre.
4,good cd,"this is band is pretty much a normal screamo band, but yet every screamo band has there own way of doing things, and they prove that in this....i first heard silver bullet on purevolume and loved it, i drink alot so i thought the silver bullet song was about coors light, heh, but anyways, i bought it the other day and fell in love (...), ohio is for lover is probably the best track on there, which they're all good though, but you should buy this no doubt, later"
2,Just short of being good...,"I first heard of Hawthorne Heights while watching MTV and thought ,""This doesn't sound too shabby."" However, upon listening more closely to the songs, I found it to be short of good. I, personally, am open to many types of music, but usually prefer alternative, hard rock, or punk rock. Hawthorne Heights seems to be a mix of all three, yet doesn't satisfy any of the categories. Some people might enjoy that aspect I suppose, but on another note...I really can't stand the background screaming in pretty much every track."
2,for people who like pop emo,This is a decent cd . But i have heard much better they just substitute screaming for meaningful lyrics. If you like this style go with Thursday much better definiately more interesting.
1,ENOUGH,"Okay, I have to admit that I was mildly impressed with ""Ohio is For Lovers"", not really willing to upload it, but it was half decent.As for the rest of the songs...ugh...the lyrics were touching but it was too much...suicidal, the music altogether made me want to commit suicide. The guitar parts were barely audible as well as the drums, all I could hear was that voice and then a random scream that was close to making me gag. The production quality was fair, but I was so overwhelmed by the singer's voice and the lyrics...this isn't good, it's just overdone...too much..."
1,"these guys dont deserve to make ""music""",this album is horrible the lyrics r bland n everything a bad emo band write's so cut my wrist n black my eyes these guys dont have any real inspiration to write these horrible lyrics the screamer sounds like he has himroids the guitar playing is something u hear at a middle school talent show the vocals r horrible the drummer uses the same beat for every song the bass player makes sid viouis look like cliff burton aviod these album
5,this cd is my world,"i absolutly love hawthorne heights. the emotion behind their song is fantastic. they sound so much different than everyone else, so dont expect to compare them to anyone else. the lyrics may seem morbid or insane, but some times thats how everyone feels. if you dont like emo, you shouldnt get this."
2,................................,"ok....... where to start? oh, right, this album is weak. Very weak. The musicianship is so incredibley bad it makes me laugh. These guys arn't even musicians the way I see it. The drums suck. You can't here the bass. The guitars (all 3 of them) suk equally. The vocalist is ok. When I was listening to this, and I was actually enjoying this one song a tiny bit, and then this idiot comes in screaming like he has to fart or something and ruins the song. Whhat the hell? when I asked my cousin what the hell was with all the pointless screaming after a couple of songs, he just looked at me and said, dude, it's an emo scream. And I just kept quiet and laughed to myself thinking what the hell? This band is turning punk rock into a fashion trend for little girls and stupid boys with no musical taste...."
1,Complete Trash,"I have no idea what was going through my head when I bought this. It's embarrasing to admit I own this CD. All the songs have the same sound and are filled with high pitched screaming that sounds like the lead singer is being put through some sort of unimaginable torture. Not to mention the lyrics suck, and refer to ""blood"" ""blades"" ""broken mirrors"". . . you get the picture."
2,I WISH I could like this...,"I truly want to like Hawthorne Heights. I want them to be the perfect Thursday replacement for Victory. But I just can't do it. The songs on this album musically, are outstanding, the first step to an amazing screamo experience. The lyrics are creative and interwoven well, artistically beautiful.Then, the screaming starts. And I'm being nice by calling it true screaming. It sounds more like he's trying to hurl out his entire insides, and frankly makes me want to do the same. And that's really all that's wrong with this album...they need someone who screams well...as strange as that sounds.""Niki FM"" and ""Ohio is for Lovers"" are tracks I can generally make it all of the way through. I want to like ""Dissolve & Decay"" but usually can't quite get there. If you like Alexisonfire, you'll like Hawthorne Heights without reservation. If you prefer Thursday, I imagine you'll feel a bit like I do. Two disappointed little stars. Sorry."
3,Underrated by the underground community,"Here's the thing about Hawthorne Heights, they're actually a decent band who just happened to pull that on card out of the deck to make it big. Unfortunately, most non-conformist screamo/emo/hardcore listeners have it in their mindset that ""success"" rhymes with ""sell-out"". Sometimes I will agree, but in this case The Silence in Black and White was reasonably succesful with the non-mainstream community before MTV even thought of picking it up and butchering it. Admittedly the album isn't the best but has some powerful songs, Blue Burns Orange is one of the more powerful Emo songs I've heard in a while. Yet much of the album seems a bit like space filling mush, it's still not a horrible album. If You're an open-minded, accepting emo fan than I would highly recommend picking up this album, it is, after all, one of the better very recent albums of it's genre"
1,"Same Crap, new title","Misreable is the title I would give to this CD. Unfortunately a band with so much marketing power puts out a chunk of crap. The only song worth mentioning is ""Ohio is for Lovers."" They sound like a garage band trying to who imitate finch or the other bands of the same genre. I believe the try to hard. Music in general has gone to nothing. Unfortunately the music world marks bands as punk. I havent heard anything that qualifies as punk that is played on the radio. Nice try, HH bring on some Simple Plan(Not Really they are worse)."
5,Screaming good!,"I am 16 years old and I love jazz and rock. When I heard one of my friends talk about this band, I wasn't very interested, but then I heard the same band at a party. The music was great. So I ordered it and waited for a week. It finally came and I listened to it. And to my surprise, the first song had the best screaming lyrics I had ever heard. I highly recommend this for Linkin Park and Trapt fans."
2,Band has potential but the pointless screaming ruins this CD,"You can clearly hear the Band's potential. Most of the songs have some melody, but the screaming makes it un-listenable. Screaming to express your anger or excitement may be ok on a few songs, but not every song -- and not when the screamer sounds like he's auditioning for a horror flick. You would think that the producer, a good friend, or even Mom and Dad would have provided some feedback on their sound. These guys are not Thursday. Pass."
2,"eh, its ok..............","first off, im not a kid.second, this album is only ok. the problem is theres nothing memorable here.when you think about ""silence in black and white"", you dont remember the guitars, drum, or the singers voice. all you here is the CONSTANT screaming!the screaming is way overdosed(and not very good to begin with). if they toned it down a bit, it could be better.these guys could be great, but they dont have an original sound at all. like i said before, nothings stands out enough that youll be hearing it in your head later.i suggest you buy from first to last if you want some good screaming."
4,"Well,","This is a decent CD. Hawthorne Heights isn't one of my favorite bands. This isn't one of my favorite CD's. But this is a good enough CD to have a spot on my low memory mp3 player. This is a popular band on Victory Records and it doesn't make sense that people liked a band before with a different name on a different label. The thing that doesn't make sense is that just because a band moves to Victory Records doesn't mean they suck. This CD gets a well earned 4 1/2 stars. I listen to hardcore/metal music too and happen to like Taking Back Sunday, Senses Fail, Silverstein, and this band. That being said Hawthorne Heights is a decent band."
3,Good cd if you didnt have the original,"Look the bonus stuff isnt too great. The concert on the cd is only 7 songs and the sound quality sucks. The signing stuff and some other things are just boring 1 minute things that shouldnt have there own chapter. By all means the cd is a 5/5 and the bonus songs are cool its just if you have the original one and really liked it, and thought that maybe you should buy this one too to get the bonus stuff, I wouldnt recommend it. I only got it cause it was only 6 bucks at warped tour. But ive seen it go up to 20 in some stores so dont blow that kind of money if you got the old one. If you dont own the old one then just get this one. Youll get the bonus stuff and the original cd. My favirate part of the purcahse I made was the cool case, and theres a new section in the booklet that tells you what the songs mean (which really opens up your eyes and really shuts the critics up). So point is, if you own the original keep it. If you dont then get this."
1,Emo?,"Isn't emo that red character from Sesame Street? Oh wait... that's Elmo. As for Hawthrone Heights, these whiney little bastards are a disgrace to music. If you want a quality music cd, then you should look into 'Days of the New - Red' by Days of the New. It pwns this piece of crap."
1,"Get in through your small little heads, this band is terrible","lame whining lyrics, sickening background vocals, and just songs with no point to them whatsoever. I really can't listen to this music it's that bad. It would seriously be a struggle for me to get through one song.Go get real music like Pearl Jam or Red Hot Chili Peppers and find out how rediculous this band is."
3,Ok but not for me.,"I really wonted to like this album but i really couldn't get into it. I really coudn't class them as a scremo/emo/or punk band. For the most part the whole album sounded the same the olny song that really stood out was ""Ohio is for lovers"" thats also the song that made me wanna buy this cd. The lead singer kinda has an emo voice and the screemer really dosen't stand out. Over all i was hopeing for a screemo/punk album and got a light screemo/emo album (really not my taste). This is probably perfect for an emo fan looking for something alittle heaver but i am not an emo fan. I'll give it 3 stars couse it was olny $8.00 and the Victory records 4 song sampler it came with was pritty damn good."
2,"okay, if you like this type of music...","I saw a commercial for hawthorne heights on tv, and it compared them to bands like taking back sunday. i like tbs a lot, so i figured they'd be similar and i'd like hawthorne heights just as much. wrong. hh isn't bad, if you like ""screamo,"" but tbs is waay different than hawthorne heights. taking back sunday hardly ever screams like that, whereas hawthorne heights does in every song...it's not my favorite type of music. don't be fooled by the commercials and stickers that claim that if you like tbs you'll love hawthorne heights. it's not a bad cd, but don't buy it if you're not into screamo.<3"
3,its okay...,"the lyrics and vocals are all pretty good, nothing really exceptional. but the screaming .. is s***! its pointless excessive and totally ruins the whole song. i probably had no business buying this CD, because its been labeled ""screamo"" and im no fan of screamo ""music"", but i did and id have to say, its not worth the money. i would LOVE them if they didnt have way to much of that screamo junk... If your into screamo this would be a really good CD to buy. personally, i cant wait until my next trip to Record and Tape Traders."
4,Quite a good Debut,"Hawthorne Heights is yet another wonderful band on the Victory Label. How can you go wrong with three guitars? I don't know not too many bands have three guitarists. Great screamo band, The best part about this band is that they don't get silly with the screaming and don't go overboard. The screams I would have to say are very well placed and give the songs a good extra kick and just make it interesting. If you like screamo then check the album out. The only reason I gave this album 4 stars is that the lyrics lack in some of the songs, but what cd doesn't have a song that lacks? well Deja entendu doesn't but that s my own opinion."
3,mediocre,"If you want a distinctive CD, this CD is probably not the choice for you. The screams in many of the tracks sound forced and after a while, it gets boring. The only tracks that stood out were Ohio is for lovers and Silver Bullet but the rest of the tracks weren't impressive. They sound like all the other screamo bands in many of them. I wouldnt completely discourage buying the CD though, i would buy it just for silver bullet because its an awesome song and may (or may not) make up for the lack of originality on the other tracks."
4,Good cd,"This is one of my favorite cds i bought this year. Most all of the songs are fairly catchy, especially ""Silver Bullets"" and ""Ohio Is For Lovers."" The other songs are fairly medocre but still hold your interest. They have 3 guitarists in some of the songs, theyre all decent players but could use some improvement. The songs could also use a little more variety in sound, as some sound similar. The drummer is quite good, hes not cymbal happy like quite a few emo drummers tend to be. The vocalist is whinny but not to whinny, hes actually quite good imo. The scream is decent, and well timed, although it is somewhat monotone and can seem unessicary. Overall its a good cd, very catchy and its quite sing-alongable. I give it a solid 4 stars for being able to stickit out in my cd player for quite a while."
2,eh...poor attempt at anythign musical,"i have a thing for the first song on this album, but after that everysong sounds the same and there all horrible at that...this isnt punk..the Ramones are punk this is emo...BAD emo"
1,Abysmal Beyond Belief,"Hawthorne Heights is the definition of what happens when you take a late 90's post-hardcore album, extract all of its redeeming elements, extract ALL real emotion and water it down for mainstream access. This is so horrid that one of the producers took his name off the credits. This band is nothing more than a bunch of tools, and it is the reason why Victory Records gets a bad image.Avoid at all costs."
2,Pissapointed,"I loved a day in the life, and when hawthorne heights first came out with silver bullet and speeding up the octaves, i was even more excited. But since these guys got on victory they just plain suck. i've never really ever liked thier lyrics but i still loved the originality of thier music. Don't buy this, it's really really generic and terrible, i only gave it 2 stars because i used to love them and its just so hard to depart"
1,Hardcore?... what!?,"this guys are not hardcore... they are a wussy little emo band who sings (more like moans) about their girfriends breaking up with them and cutting their wrists because their life is sooo bad... the ""screaming"" is as bad as atreyu and the singer sounds like fall out boy (which is NOT a good thing)... i hate all these mainstream emo bands that can't sing and think they are heavy because they add a pathetic screamer in the background that sounds like he's throwing up... me and my friends actually made a video making fun of these guys because of how bad they were... can't believe these guys actually have fans let alone a CD... wish i could give negative stars"
1,Only for the spoiled...,"This CD is for the spoiled only...First of all, three guitarists, ha. One guitarist could be better, there riffs are so generic and bland, it amazes me they are successful.The lyrics are terrible, even on emo standards. The singer is ok, but a little worse than all of the other emo singers, which is bad due to the fact they all sound a like, mix that up with forced shouting, terrible whiny vocals, and bad music writing and they are truly down on the ground.I like Victory Records, but don't put this crap out, don't put the comment saying their good on the cover (looks bad when the label writes it) and don't ever sign a band like this. Silverstein and Taking Back Sunday are on this label and blow Hawthorne Heights out of the water.Hawthorne heights are overrated and crap, even compared to emo standards...1/2 / 5 Stars"
1,Wow...what could I say that hasn't been said?,"I know.GET THE HELL AWAY FROM MY WINDOW WITH YOUR RADIO!Thats some scary stuff. I really hate this music. Almost as much as top 40 pop and rap, and I pity people who like any of that stuff. For a more detailed review on music today please visit my 1 star review for that new Fergie cd (the explicit lyrics one). You will most likely be pleased. Also, I can't stand those ""emo"" kids. Ok, for those of you who are listeing, you have nothing to be depressed about. The average ""emo"" kid is an upper middle class kid with everything going for him/her who wants to ""stand out"" from the crowd and look like a complete fag in some girl pants. Grow up.Sincerely,Jake"
2,Josh G is an idiot,"Josh G is a Hawthorn Heights fanboy. He is right, do not judge this band on ""Ohio is for Lovers"" because that is the only good song and you will get a terribly skewed idea of how this band performs. Please mark his review as ""not helpful"" and read some of the real reviews posted below!"
3,"Not a bad album, but too much gratuitous and unnecessary screaming","i bought this cd after hearing ohio is for lovers, and the other songs are pretty much consistent with that song. hawthorne heights definitely is a mixture of metal, emo, pop punk, and other genres of rock, which is sometimes good and sometimes bad. i liked all the elements of emo/pop punk, but through out the cd there was way way too much screaming. there's screaming sometimes after every line, its odd and it took away from the songs i thought. i think if they stuck with singing more and screaming less, this album would have rocked much more. btw, i'm not against screaming or anything, other bands like story of the year just time it better and it adds to the songs, whereas here, theres just too much and the songs just dont sound the same as a result. but overall, this is a decent album and im sure theyll get better on their next release."
1,THIS CD SUXS!,"yea...i was feeling nice one day while i was in warehouse music. i saw HH and on tha cover it said that TBS like them and that HH kinda sounded like TBS...I LOVE TAKING BACK SUNDAY so of course if a cd has TBS on the cover than the cd cant be completely unpleasent sounding....RIGHT? WRONG.DO NOT BUY THIS CD. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. its a waste of 13 dollars. you can do so much more w/ that money, like go to mcdonalds, buy a pair of socks, or even go vaccum out your car.THEY ATTEMPT TO SCREAM AND ITS JUST HORRIBLE. some ppl shouldnt b allowd to open their mouths..not even to yawn.OHIO IS FOR LOVERS...yea, i liked that song too, so i got this cd. thats the only decent song on there, but after awhile, its just not enuff. if i could go back in time n return tha cd i would. cuz its a sad disappointment and disgrace to all bands and ppl who play any type of instrument ne where. SAD AND PATHETIC."
1,"Dissolve and Decay, Please!!!!","This album is one of the worst albums i've ever heard. Their music is not good, plus their lyrics are horrible. Sometimes I don't even know what the hell they are saying. And don't get me started with the screaming. Worst screamer ever! It is so annoying. My Grandma can do better. If I were you, don't bother wasting your money with such crap. Stick to real bands like MCR, Taking Back Sunday, and The Used."
1,Sadly Mainstream,I bought this cd a year and a half ago (roughly)...and absolutly loved it. Nobody knew about this band and they were my little secret.The cd was the soundtrack for every day I went thru.But I lost it for 7 months and found it 2 weeks ago...and I was excited to put it back into my cd player to reminisce.IT SUCKS BEYOND WORDS!!!Now noticing how horrible the band is...FUSE and Mtv are playing it ALOT...and I just feel like throwing up.I saw a little girl (maybe 11 years old) wearing a Hawthorne Heights t-shirt and stared thinking...GOD DAMN YOU MTV AND FUSE MAKING ONCE WAS COOL MUSIC...MAINSTREAM!!!
5,Worth The Purchase,"Every song is really good and its worth every dime in your pocket. If your Into Emo sort of type music like, From First to Last, Taking Back Sunday and Senses Fail you would Definatly Like this CD it's worth the purchase and its one of those CD's that you would never get tired of listening to."
1,boring,"i bought this CD last winter, way before MTV was playing the video, and 14 year old girls were screaming cut my wrists and black my eyes in hot topic. i'm not a huge fan of this genre they call ""screamo"" in general. most of it sounds the same and it really doesnt take much talent. every song you listen to on this record you've heard over and over again by countless bands. the only song on this record that is half decent is the transition. other then that they are all melancholy, boring, drawn-out screamo songs."
1,i've already heard this,"the singer sounds just like chris carrabba, back in his further seems forever days... FSF minus mega ovaries minus talent = hawthorne heights"
2,"Eh, read the other reviews and tell me what you think","Ohio is for lover is ok, good song if you just got dumped or something, but really its a shi@#y over all album. I cant express everything i wana without being a biter so read like that DontLookDownDontLookDownDontLookDown revew lik,e from the 27th, i 2nd most of he's saying"
4,Singing And Screaming for the Masses,This cd is good for the people who aren't tired of hearing the same old stuff. Yes it is just the same as any other band but I still respect it for their talented music. This cd has very heartfelt lyrics and that is always a plus to know that they aren't just babbling bout pointless crap. My Favorite song is Life on Standby and then Wake Up Call is another very good song. Instead of getting this album I suggest getting the new one from Alexisonfire or Underoath. But this is a good one to add to your collection also.
3,It's an ok start,"Sweet Cheeks ""watty420""...you're a moron. Look at this guys reviews..he actually spends his time going to every emo/punk cd dissing the ""emo"" lifestyle. Seriously, do you have a life? And at least post different comments, you post the same exact thing for every cd you apparently review.Now, an actual review. This cd is just ok for me, the songs are great but lyrically it's just the same things I've heard before. I think it's a great start to a promising band. I would recommend it to fans of underoath or similar bands."
2,meh,"I went through my lil emo phase years ago, even then I didn't fully appreciate this cd. It's very cliche and only at some moments is kind of catchy. The 1st song I'll always like because of the dramatic music and voice change, but other than that Nikki Fm and the Ohio song are the only ones that at one point I liked. The cd as a whole is a ok, it definately applies more for the scene kids and what not."
4,"good cd, but form your own opinion","Stop the hate everybody this is an emo/screamo band, i've heard this album many times before (god bless mp3's) and I am actually about to buy it to pass my time in afghanistan, granted my favorite songs are the singles its still a good album. and just my two cents from a black kid who listens to anything from T.I. and jurassic 5 to avenged sevenfold, escape the fate, chiodos, rise against(3 of 4 albums) thursday, TBS to The Forecast and Billy talent (check these two out) I definitely would say if you wanna rock out give this album a shot everybody loves a lil bit screaming mixed with depression"
4,give it a shot,"Stop the hate everybody this is an emo/screamo band, i've heard this album many times before (god bless mp3's) and I am actually about to buy it to pass my time in afghanistan, granted my favorite songs are the singles its still a good album. and just my two cents from a black kid who listens to anything from T.I. and jurassic 5 to avenged sevenfold, escape the fate, chiodos, thursday, TBS to The Forecast and Billy talent (check these two out) I definitely would say if you wanna rock out give this album a shot everybody loves a lil bit screaming mixed with depression"
2,Another generic band Victory shoves out...,"I have a few friends at school who actually formed a group of kids who claim they are ""emo"". I listen to a lot of punk (PUNK, not pop-punk: Bad Religion, Sex Pistols, Ramones, Descendents), not emo, and this was something new for me. I picked up both of the albums, of course, listening to this one first. The first few songs were alright, at first. After track five, I decided to listen to the CD again. The tracks are practically all the same. The singer's voice is painful, the ""emo"" screams sound fake, the bass is pretty decent, actually. The guitar sounded repetitive, the drums were nothing special. There may be one or two decent songs on the album, the single obviously. I may be new to this emo thing, but I know this isn't music that so many kids think it's awesome to look sad about."
1,un-talented garbage,"How do bands like this ever gain recognition? This is generic, unoriginal, uninspiring, ""music"" delivered without passion at all. The lyrics on this album have absolutely no message worth hearing. ""Cut my wrists and black my eyes"".....overwrought and generic. This band needs to drop the screaming, first of all. It doesn't fit when someone is singing and out of nowhere there is screaming. It sucks, for lack of a better term. It pains me to see bands like this gain recognition for being ""emo"". Jawbreaker was lightyears ahead of these frauds. I would even go as far as saying that Alkaline Trio's ""Maybe I'll Catch Fire"" record was better ""emowise"" then this. At least Jawbreaker and Alkaline Trio are sincere and heartfelt. I would avoid this crap at all costs and find music with passion and originality (cough SKA) before saying that this is good in any way."
1,the most unorignal music trend,"This is exactly why emo doesnt get respect in music. It ALL sounds the same, everyone looks the same, the lyrics are lame, and that stupid screaming. Honestly I wouldnt be able to tell this band from any other emo band by just listening. It's so unoriginal and boring. If you want moody music listen to The Cure or The Smiths, at least when they whined it sounded good."
1,How can I put this lightly?,"Hawthorne Heights is, well, BAD. Each and every one of their songs sounds the same, the songwriting is horrible (""I'm outside your window with my radio"") particularly stands out), their so-called ""screamer"" can't scream to save his life, and they make absolutely no use of the three guitarists. Derivitave emo crap."
1,Hawthorne Heights,"I hate Hawthorne Heights is a horrible emo band.The only single that sounds decent is ""Ohio is for lovers."""
2,Emo.....,"Emo is NOT this. As a reviewer said earlier, emo was created in the 1980's, and was an offshoot of punk.So......Hawthorne Heights......hmmm. A kid at my summer camp, who some may call a ""poser emo kid"", said that Hawthorne Heights was bad. He, who has no idea what emo actually is, said that this band only ""whined about losing girlfriends and cutting themselves""Add the crappy lyrical content to even worse music(very poor stylized screams, terrible instrumentation) and you get this. Hawthorne Heights.......I must say emo isn't my favorite genre (metal, indie, and prog have that honor)As a casual emo listener, I deem this trite, jump-on-the-bandwagon garbage.Goodbye"
5,great cd.,"The first song I heard from this cd was Silver Bullet. I fell in love with HH right then. A few weeks later I saw them live and they put on such a great show. I bought there cd at the show and personally told them how amazing they are. I'm a big fan of bands like Taking Back Sunday and Thursday, all of those ""post-hardcore, emo"" bands. I think Hawthorne is an amazing new band that falls in the same genre. If your a fan of that genre then buy this cd, you wont regret it."
1,How to ruin a potentially GREAT cd.......,"Add CONSTANT SCREAMING!!! Man, you have no idea how upset and disappointed I am about this cd! When I began listening to it I became all excited...the music was great, the vocals really nice and I was feeling the lyrics too. Then some A-HOLE starts SCREAMING like a total morron and drowns out a potentially great debut cd! Gosh!!! What a F**k'in waste!!! I really wish these guys would go back in the studio, re-record the entire cd WITHOUT the SCREAMING A-HOLE!!! Anyone who agrees, we should seriously get a petition together to have the screams removed!!! This could have easily been a 5+ star review but because my head hurts so bad from all the screaming I can (sadly) only offer 1 star."
1,"Good riffs, hilarious screaming. Way too funny! Respect!","1 star? Or 5 stars? I can't make up my mind. This band has tight riffs, and an overall good sound. But I'm listening to the entire album as I write this, and although the screaming seemed heartfelt at first, the comedy of the screaming is getting to me. I feel like a kid at a funeral, you know, where you're not supposed to laugh, but then someone says something so hilarious and it builds and you can't keep it in anymore. AHHH HHHAAAA HAAaah haa! This is too funny. Someone, please pass the Vicks, I'm getting a sore throat just listening to this! (And believe me, it's from the laughing... this is the funniest thing I've heard since the 80's). Ahh heh heh hee HEEEh heee! This is some brilliant stuff. Spinal Tap. Tenacious D. Hard Core Logo. Hawthore Heights. Respect! Okay, only 1 star, but because I respect what they've done here. Way too funny."
1,BOOHOO,"Once again another emo band whining about how terrible life is. We don't want to hear it!!! Keep it to yourselves, you wimps. Why do emo bands exist to begin with. They write about how messed up their life is when basically everybodies life is messed up. We've all got problems. But we don't have to put it in music so the rest of the world has to listen to it. SHUT UP!!!"
2,unoriginal,"i am a fan of screamo/emo, but this band just doesn't do it for me. like everyone else... i think they're really just posing. it's hard to find originality in this genre mainly because EVERYTHING has come out over the last four years, and no one's really had a chance to break away and become innovative. but there is hope. if you're a fan of this genre, then you really need to get full collapse by thursday, and every thrice cd you can get your hands on. i guess you could call hawthorne heights a good gateway band.... maybe"
1,horrible,"""and does it quite well, much better than those whiny metal bands like System of a Down"" - This coming from a person who claims to be Limp Biskit's #1 fan...nice job there chief...Seriously go crawl back under the rock from which you came because you obviously know crap about music, and you have no business reviewing it. System of a Down is a 100x better than your horrible ""band"" Hawthorne Heights. Go ""cut your wrists and black your eyes,"" while I listen to System of a Down, a band that actually has something worthwhile to say."
1,Would be good if...,"That guy would stop screaming along with the lyrics. The songs are good, the main vocalist is good...the music itself is great, but the backup singer who sounds like the white cap at a kegger who's trying to sing metallica just HAS to go...or clear his throat. Makes this all but unlistenable, which is a shame."
1,scrEMO is not music; it's a lack of regard for music,"It's true that Hawthorne Heights' debut is an awful album (it belongs with albums from The Used, Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and all the other bands playing Warped '05 minus Rancid... in a huge bonfire). scrEMO (or whatever the hell this new 'genre' of music is called) is just talentless garbage.I found the following quite funny. Someone on google said the following about the ""don't look down"" reviewer (I guess they read his review here):""Everyone laugh at the don't_look_down boy. He asked someone for a beer and a bl*wjob, and the bartender poured a glass of ale in his lap and broke his little shaft in half for being such a dumbass.Ha."
4,first but not the best,"I really enjoyed this cd when I first go it and now I can still listen to it and enjoy the cd. But now there is something missing, I like bands like this, but hawthorne heights lyrics are a little too simple it doesn't seem as if he really cares about what hes writing. And the screaming seems like its in the background, its weird. But it is still a really good album with good guitar riffs. It may take a couple times listening to the cd to really enjoy it but I definitley reccomend it to anyone who enjoys bands like Senses Fail, UnderOath, Silverstein, ect. I like this king of stuff and other that are much less hardcore like Fall Out Boy, Motion City Soundtrack, Taking Back Sunday and Brand New."
3,eh,"This album is pretty good, however I feel that the band could do much better. This album was a lot different than I expected it to be, especially in the deliverly of the vocals. I was very excited when I heard ""Speeding Up The Octaves"" and ""Silver Bullet,"" but they are much different from the demos that were available for download. The songs just follow the pattern of sing scream sing that Thursday made so popular. The difference is Hawthorne Heights' singer can actually sing. Anyone that likes (and isn't tired of) ""screamo"" bands will love this album. I wouldn't be suprised if this band blows up in a few months"
4,!!~ Hawthorne Heights ~!!,"So I was watching the tv one day and I heard Ohio is 4 lovers I got Hooked right away I swear I listened to it over and over and overrrrrrrr again...so I bought the cd And adore it and I hated as others screaming in songs and honestly the songs are real good the screaming doesn't bother me it just goes together but u gotta admit JT has an AMAZING voise and vocal range and poor casey (screamer) lol I can imagine how soar he is after his shows, anyways the best of the best are :Ohio Is for LoversNiki FMSilver BulletBlue Burns OrangeSpeeding Up the OctavesEven bought their TICKETS 4 their show Can't wait"
3,B list Emo band,"My headline I think sums it up. With all the success that emo/screamo bands have had its seems like more and more are poping up each day. The truth is I like that kind of music so its nice to find some new good bands and listening to new stuff. If you like Thursday, taking back sunday, used, Finch your probable going to like this albulm. Just don't exspect it to be as good as any of those bands. they are good enough that I will probable buy there next albulm. Good but not great."
1,Ugh times two.,"This is what's wrong with the underground music scene. There are seriously a million bands like this singing the exact same songs.""cut my wrists and black my eyes!""That line alone makes me shudder. Anyway, at least this band isn't as bad as silverstein. I'll give them that.So anyway, I have to go because I woke up this morning with a hole in my chest, my girlfriend ripped my heart out so now I'm going to slit my wrists and if my words were wisdom, you'd sew my mouth shut as i fold into black and darkness of my black dark heart, which is scarred and black, and if it had wrists it would slit them, too."
1,"Terrible screams, terrible waste of 3 guitars, terrible band",Ever heard of a band called Clutch? Now their singer can actually sing.
1,Geeze...,"To all the 13-17 year olds with more or less trendy taste in music...this emo label has gotten so old. This band does nothing to be unique or stand-out from their peers at all. The screaming sounds like a parody of other emo bands(literally). And plus it's just not interesting to listen to at all, as a musican myself...I'm not a big emo fan but I have to admit I like Finch's debut, Saves the Day's ""Through Being Cool"", and anything Jawbreaker...but that's about it, atleast those bands had a style of their own...HH sounds just like every other emo band on radio/mtv nowadays and vice-versa...oh and the word emo has more to do with a fashion or teenage demographic these days than any kind of particular musical style...it's all gotten so played out...oh and props to NoFx for kicking ass after all these years since I'm listening to them at the moment"
1,GO AWAY!,I can't stand it anymore!different from Taking back Sunday? Why cause they're from Ohio? Waa Waa Waa!! Emo pussy boys screaming and kicking about how their hearts are broken and how they miss their home town. Screw it! How do you people fall for this? seriously! Its sad! This is no different from the Pop Punk craze or the Nu-metal craze or the Boy band craze. Open your god damn eyes people.(sigh)And someone stop Victory Records from making these 'dual vocal explosions for the listeners of Thursday and TBS!' SHUT-UP!I'm going to go relax...i might kill someone after listening to this unoriginal generic poo poo. UGH!
1,Unbearably Untalented,"I really wouldn't mind them THAT much if it weren't for that screaming in the background... it literally gets under my skin and makes me want to karate chop my CD player every time that guy opens his mouth. Is the manager choking him for sucking? because that's what I would do. It sounds TERRIBLE and requires no skill what-so-ever. I do enjoy the primary vocalist's voice, too bad it's wasted on generic cloned lyrics that pour out his unbearably painful teen angst. Dear God, there isn't enough aspirin in the western hemisphere..."
1,I'd Give This A Zero...,"Ok...normally I look at music in this order at first glance:The music itselfThe vocalsThe technical stuff in the music (pull-offs, harmonics, etc.)This band and this album doesn't accomplish any of this (let alone the whiny melodramatic lyrics i.e. ""I can't make it on my ownnnnn!!!!!"")Yeah at least if you're going to be whiny, back it up with some skills for crying out loud."
1,Love me! I'm so deep and hard to understand!,"That's because I listen to Hawthorne Heights who write very personal music that takes a profound look into the human soul, a troubled soul at that.Actually, they're just like every other p**sy emo band out there, so let me just save you the trouble of buying this album and give you a preview of every song on here:""My girlfriend of two weeks, whom I love with every fiber of my soul, dumped me today. I'm a deep, troubled, intense individual with so many problems that no one, especially my well-to-do, affluent parents, could understand or help me with. For example, I ran out of my favorite eyeliner today and somehow lost my white, studded belt. Now I will write about this all in my journal, and afterwards I'll cut myself in the corner, have a good cry and then re-apply my make-up.""That's enough to make you cry, isn't it?"
2,expected better,"i liked Ohio Is For Lovers when i first heard it so i got the song, but when i heard the rest of the album after my sister got it i hated it...u cant hear half the lyrics because of the screaming....if i were u i would buy ohio is for lovers on itunes rather that buying the whole cd- it isnt worth itthe only reason this gets 2 stars is cuz of the one good song"
2,generic music,"with the exception of ""ohio is for lovers"" the whole cd sounds like generic rock. my definition of generic rock is: music that seems undistinctable. i couldn' tell which song was which, becuase they all sounded the same."
1,Hawthorne Heights is to emo as McDonalds is to food.,"Generic vocal hooks, basic drum beats, guitar riffs a 13 year old can play, and with a catchiness that makes you want to slit your wrists. This is the kind of stuff 14 year old girls who think they are depressed can get into. If you want to be an overweight girl with dark eye shadows, black fingernails, fake black hair, who acts depressed to get attention, and who tore down her N*Sync poster two months ago, this is for you."
1,Terrible,"When i first heard Ohio is for lovers i thought that they were pretty good(a little too much screaming) ANyways i decided to go out and buy their cd. What a mistake. Every song sounds the same. There is a whiny voice and then someone comes in and screams every five seconds.The screaming gets unbelievably annoying and how can u listen to lyrics like ""cut my wrists and block my eyes so i can fall asleep tonight""? Does it make you fell good listening to those kind oof lyrics? It makes me feel like crap when i have to listen to lyrics like that and if you can stand listening to them for more than five minutes i feel sorry for you."
1,i can't get over the screaming,"does anyone notice that the screamer in this band sounds like he's passing a stone everytime he opens his mouth?(...)tell ya what tho, if you really want ""the silence in black and white"", but don't wanna pay 10 bucks for it, go flush your toilet 11 times. it's practically the same."
3,Uneven,"First 10 to 15 minutes of this production suck, as we're thrown to a time and a place that arent' really recognizable and in with characters that aren't established (I've never seen ""Madagascar"" so I'm probably not the target viewing demographic). After that, things pick up as Santa Claus enters the picture.From there the story is told in split, with half of it following the main characters on their quest to deliver gifts and the other half stuck back on the island with the jolly old fat man, who now has amnesia. The half that follows the gift-givers is, by far, the better of the two and that portion of the production makes it viewable. Without that this would earn two stars, maybe less, because Danny Jacobs, doing his best Robin Williams impersonation as the meerkat king, is not funny. Nor, for that matter, is Robin Williams."
5,Very Funny,"A must for any Madagascar fan. Julian is at his best with his "" Happy Juliananuary Day"". We watch it as a family throughout the year- always keeps a smile on our faces. Would recommend this to any Madagascar fan."
4,Suprise Delight,Very entertaining 30 min flick. Very funny and brings back all the characters of the original Madagascar films in good taste. defenietly a must buy for all Madagascar fans.
5,Merry Animation,"If you like animation, and you like Christmas, then you will love Merry Madagascar. I don't really get into writing reviews, but they help me when I am trying to make a decision, and I think this is one to write about. My grandchildren love this CG cartoon. It is done with all the thought and care put into a full blown movie. I recommend it highly."
3,Fair to almost good,"This could have been much, much better. I enjoyed this but itjust felt a little rushed - like there was a tad too much storyto cram into 30 mintues.This would have been a lot better if it had been expandedanother 10 or 12 mintues. Usually I think a movie would be betterif it was a few mintues shorter.Either that or cut some of the story.'Shrek the Halls' was a little short and would have benefittedfrom a few more mintues as well.I really was hoping I would like this a lot as I loved the firstMadagascar movie. The 2nd one was a whole step down from thefirst but that's very common for a sequel.Sadly it's just not in the same class as 'A Charley Brown Christmas'or the 'The Grinch'. It could have been but just wasn't.But we will watch it again."
5,Dynamic Haydn,"Jochum's London symphony set is amongst the best modern instrument versions currently available. Jocum's great virtue lies in his handling of Haydn's slow movements, which in unsympathetic hands can sound bland. His firm baselines and clear phrasing make for characterful performances full of light and shade. Listen, for example, to the often hackneyed 2nd movement of 101, or the stirring middle section of 99. Also notable are his finales, which fizz with energy. Listen for example, to the finale to no. 101, one of the best performances on disc (superior, for example, to Dorati's). His 97 gives trumpets and drums their head, while the finale to 98 is one of the most poised and flowing available.For original instruments fans, Norrington's 99 - 104 on EMI are superior, but for those who want a bid price complete set by a conductor who has a fine understanding of the requirements of Haydn, then this is strongly recommended."
5,Outstanding quality,"This table and chair exceeded my expectation, which is not easy to do. The craftsmanship is evident in not only it's structure and strength, but in the painted artwork on the table and chairs. I bought the set for my 2 year old grandson as a place he could sit and color, cut, and eat. He often insists I sit on the other chair with him, and I am not a small woman. Though very hesitant to test out these chairs, I sat on it and it held my weight with no issues! This is not a cheap set but well worth the money....it will last for a while, even if you have more than one child playing on it. My only wish was that it came with 4 chairs instead of 2. Buying 2 extra chairs so other kids can sit at the table makes this set a tad too pricey for me, so we're getting along with 2 chairs."
3,Julianne Nicholson Looks Great in 'Pajamas',"""Flannel Pajamas"" is anchored primarily by the heartbreaking performance of lead actress Julianne Nicholson. This realistic depiction of love forming and falling apart works on a scene by scene basis, especially in several brilliantly written exchanges that Nicholson and co-star Justin Kirk play with the perfect blend angst, confusion, and hope. As a whole, the film could stand to be twenty minutes shorter, ditching several underdeveloped subplots and peripheral characters. Stylistically, the movie feels a bit dated. Digital video may have better captured its voyeuristic examination of contemporary married life. But this is an exercise in content, not form, and Nicholson makes it all worthwhile."
4,Lessons from Flannel Pajamas,"Justin Kirk's character ""Stuart"" thinks he is madly in love, but does not understand that mutual respect is an essential component of love. For her part, Julianne Nicholson's character ""Nicole"" is more in heat than in love. The show is very intense, but portrays realistically the consequences of immature ""love."" Both actors give outstanding performances in a story that has much to teach about relationships."
5,Worth reading for the short stories,"NYC: A self-pitying writer hangs himself in the opening scene. Some months later, a young lady moves into his apartment and discovers his collection of stories, which are reprinted in the book. He's, you know, around and he gets interested in her as a way back into the world he so casually left behind. Some of those stories (especially the one about the Halloween when the Old Ones got tired of humans not taking their day seriously enough) haunt me to this day, and I read this book _years_ ago.Skipp and Spector never got enough credit for the power and viscerality of their writing. Read anything you can find that was written by them (except maybe for ""Animals"", that one wasn't so good)."
5,Charlie is THE BOMB!,"This is the quintessential recording of the Weber concertos -- played lightly, with the rubato and over-the-top phrasing that any self-respecting diva would use in Weber's day. Neidich's *amazing* technique allows him to make music where others play exercises.. . . and if you're a clarinet player, the Rossini will make your jaw drop -- better listen to this one sitting down!Orpheus is one of my favorite orchestras, and they do a commendable job setting the stage for Mr. Neidich.This one is a MUST BUY!"
3,Music Subservient to Performer,"Yes,Charles Neidich has superb control of his instrument. However, whenever I hear him I feel like it's ""The Charlie Neidich Show"" rather than the music at hand. It is this in-your-face style of playing that detracts from the listening experience. Instead of the Neidich recording, I would recommend the CD of Weber works performed by Jon Manasse. Manasse also has first rate technique, but he consistantly serves the music. With his performances, I can comfortably focus on the music itself. Also, his tone has a subtle effortless beauty."
5,You Never Know Your Favorite Japanese Anime Until You Watch A Series,"Yes, I got this little secret, my body & head aches from doing artwork & sculpting all day and sometimes it is hard to sleep. Also, I am constantly looking for new & different inspiration for my artwork to please my new clients(they are all into Japanese anime, Japanese Manga, & Dollfies.) So, one night I watch the beginning of Inuyasha Season 1, and I was ""hooked."" Inuyasha is not only entertaining, I've come to love the series & characters, and I love to look at the artwork, especially scenic treatments, that the characters & story run though. Now, I own up to Season 5, and I have been satisfied."
4,the only good season of inuyasha,"Inuyasha seson one is in my opinion the only good season of this anime....after that it gets kinda predictable and annoying,also in a lot of the episodes they use still frame shots which I absolutely despise in anime.....all in all its a four star show up untill about episode 50...after that I would move on to better animesuch ashellsingexcel sagaakiraspirited awaynow and then here and thereneon genesis evangelionoutlaw starfooly coolylast exileranma 1/2paranoia agentanything else from satoshi konany and all miyazaki moviescowboy bebopsamurai xsamurai champloowolfs raingunslinger girlinuyasha is okay....the one reason to keep watching is that kagome is hot....also I liked the manga better"
5,Q3,"THIS IS NOT A REVIEW. IT IS A QUIZ FOR INU-YASHA FANS ONLY. This is a quiz on Season 1.1.Who is the demon of hair???2.What is Kagome's brother's name???3.Who kisses Inu-Yasha in the 1st season???4.There are three names for the Sacred Jewel. (including that one) Name one of the two others.5.(take a guess here) In around the 100-110th episodes (way past Season 1) there are are a team of strong enemies. Finish this name of their group with a number. Band of ________Answers are below.1.Yura2.Sota3.Kikyo4.Shikong Jewel or Jewel of Four Souls5.SevenAny reviews titled Q, then the number in which I did it from earliest to latest are quizzes by me on that anime series."
5,Inuyasha is the best,"Inuyasha is a great series. I love it, especially in the subtitled version. If you would like to know more about the other series's. email me at chels0002@excite.com."
1,The anime that wont die,"I'll keep this really short. Always hated the show until recently. Started watching it, realized how shallow and derivative it is and still enjoy it. But the asking price is absolutely absurd. Watch it for free online."
5,Great price x3,"For the price, this is a amazing deal. I mean, look at most anime. It usually runs for 20$ at least for 30 or less episodes. And InuYasha runs for around 40$ usually xD So yeah..The quality is good and though you may not get as much bonus stuff as you would with the expensive box sets, you get the episodes for a good price."
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT,"there are a few mistranslations in the english version...but i love the japanese version. Kappei Yamaguchi...man do i just LOVE him!! an essential in the life of an anime obsessor...like me, heh heh ^_^"
3,alright,my biggest gripe was the condition of the box it was in extremely poor condition nearly falling apart but otherwise everything else was good
5,=),This is by far my favorite anime and i cant wait to watch the other seasons. The price is extremely good and the order came in quicker than i expected. If you want something new to watch i would go for this
5,Inuyasha Season 1,"I have seen all of the seasons but this definitely makes the show. You can't just jump in and watch an anime cartoon without wondering why Sesshomaru doesn't have a left arm, or why the two brothers are fighting...or even wonder why there is a human girl, a demon slayer, a monk, a half demon, and a fox demon all wandering around looking for some guy called Naraku. Inuyasha Season 1 is great because it's completely informative with a lot of action and adventure. It's not romantic or dramatic like some others, but it's got touches of that in it. The whole show is great. I bought it and I watch it over and over! I love it!"
5,Crowd Pleaser,"Though my taste in Amine tends to go away from what is aired on tv b/c they are often very bubblegummy, Inuyasha is a great exception, though its not really a must see for hard core violence junkies but there's enough action in it to keep everyone entwined. With the ongoing plot line, underlining mini adventures and character developments, Inuyasha never seems to pray to much on the predictable story lines. It truly is a crowd pleaser. I dare anyone to watch the first set of episodes and not be jonesing for the next. Finally, its no longer a problem with the entire first session, grab the popcorn and settle in for hours of entertainment. Now if they'd only get around to releasing session two."
3,"It's not a bad DVD box set, but it could've been better","This set includes five DVDs that encompass all twenty-seven episodes in the first season. The first three discs contain five episodes, the fourth disc contains six episodes, and the fifth disc contains six episodes and bonus features.For special features, there is a character relationship guide, a collection of trailers for Inuyasha: Affections Touching Across Time, and textless versions of the opening credits and both versions of the ending credits that appear in the first season.I was a little disappointed that all the special features were put onto one disc. Since all the features were put on a disc with six episodes, it shows just how much wasted space there is on the first three discs in the set. I also wish there had been a little more in the way of extras.But even with those minor flaws, this set is worth it if you're a fan of the series."
2,Very disappointed,"I was excited to get a Pilates for men workout, but when I ordered this I hadn't realized it was by a woman.I guess what I mean is I expected a tougher, drill sargent. I know that's not really what Pilates is but it made me feel like I was doing a womanly workout. I guess I wanted something a little more fast piced, this bored me to death. I couldn't get through the entire thing the first time because Lindsey's voice annoyed the hell out of me. I am extremely disappointed with this, the only redeeming quality about this dvd is the 15 minute workout at the end. What a waste 0f $22."
5,great for kids learning to read,"Yes, this is a bit boring for adults to read. But it has the charming old-fashioned illustrations, and frankly it's not meant for adults to read! The purpose of the Dick and Jane books is to teach kids to read. So many kids' books are really meant to be read aloud to them. The vocabulary is beyond their ability to sound out - at least until the story is too childish for them. Dick and Jane solve that problem.Once we got Dick and Jane books for our duaghter, she took off. I think she had read the whole first book in a couple of weeks - and she was only in preschool! The series starts with a very limited vocabulary and moves along gradually. Be sure to start at the beginning with a beginning reader and go through in order."
1,What the heck happened here!,"I'm not a movie expert. I just like Movies.....This film has lots of well known actors. But the thing that strikes me is: 1) The sound is wrong, 2) the cutting is wrong, 3) the direction is wrong, 4) post production editing is wrong.....When you watch this it seems like it could be a good movie, but it just does not make it. Never seen a film with so many A/B list actors that was so poorly made. Just sad really....."
1,Terrible Film. . . .,"The acting was beyond sup-par. I have no idea what Dennis Hopper was thinking when taking this film. Don't be fooled by Nas appearing on the cover, he's dead between the 2nd and 3rd chapter of the disc. All the acting in this film was a huge disappointment. The story line, action sequences all horrible. . .The only thing good out of this whole ordeal was it was a Blockbuster rental."
2,Soundtrack question,"I am interested in knowing about any soundtrack information associated with Steven Segal's TICKER. The celtic sounds in the movie are intriguing, and as lovers of celtic music, my husband and I would like to know more about the artist and her work. Can anyone accommodate us?Thank you."
1,Dissapointing,The film is just so bad that I don't even know how to put it into words. Wacthing it is just a waste of time. I can't believe Steven Seagal is one of the cast in this terrible movie. One star is for the nice poster design. Thats the only good thing about the film.
2,Bomb!,"Not one of Seagal's greatest movies! I purchased this video for my wife who has every film He has played in, watch it and was disapointed."
1,Do not buy!,"This movie is horrible! (...) There are extras in this movie that have longer roles than [Nas]. Steven Seagal give his normal acting performance, a really bad one. He tries to be a Zen master but ends up sounding like a (...) that quit school after 2nd grade. The only good thing about this movie is the explosions, if you want plot don't come here, you won't find anything that could even be called a distant cousin of plot."
1,poor waste of film,This is the first movie I ever saw where I believe the actors didnt care and made up thier lines. This movie had to have been completly free lanced by the actors. Seagal has doomed his career to a plumeting firey death. This is one bad bad movie. why it was ever released is the mystery of the ages.
3,good but no half past dead,this movie deserves no more or no less than 3 stars it has got a typical actioner story bomb threat. as far as action goes theres not much of it although seagal does have a couple of fights at end the picture is good the sound is good trailer does make the film look not as good as it is
3,another interesting novel,ok there are militias out there and they could probably do soem major damge look at OK City but even if they got together a squadron of f-16 could blow the hell out of them throw in how ever many tanks batalions and special forces we have and even a guy with an rpg and an ak-47 in a pickup truck won't be able to do much but the book is a good book but it really never explains a major reason the militias revolt in the first place. ok a militia member was killed but why would all the militias in america basically comit suicide by challenging the US army
3,"Good ""Fiction"" nothing else.","""The story started in ""Showdown: USA vs. Militia"" continues in this thrilling war novel from the author of ""WW III"" series.""I would hardly call any of Slater's works a ""War Novel"". His works are pure fiction and nothing less. I have read as much of his WWIII series as I could stand and his ""USA vs Milita"" series also. It is obvious that he has not done his homework properly as other authors of his type have. His numerous errors not only detract from the story line but also add to a sense of ignorance to the overall storyline. I have read Ian Slater's works in the past and probably will in the future if I cannot find anything else worth reading at the local 1/2 priced book store."
5,The BEST War Book ever written!,"Ian Slater pulls you into the action in the greatest war book ever. You take part of both sides. The Militia, a secret army with the power that will try to take over the country. The Federals, armed and ready fighting for the US. You will never want to put this book down wanting to know who will win the next battle. This is the greatest book on war ever written. I didn't find one flaw with this book. I can't wait to buy more books from Slater. If you don't read Battle Front, you will miss the time of your life!"
1,1 star is very generous,"This is poorly written: the characters are cardboard and stereotyped, the plot is thin, and I don't think this author has any clue what reactive armor is or how it works (putting explosives on a thinly-skinned ""armored pickup"" -- clearly has never heard of spalling, either.) The tactics are unbelievable, not only from a technical standpoint, but also because the US troops are always portrayed as green and the militia are always battle-hardened veterans.Find something else to read."
4,Relaxing,"Hello,I found this album to be very relaxing. Pleasant for those semi-quiet times. Wouldn't have it at breakfast but more like a brunch or lunch music. Also I'd find it pleasing to listen to at a cafe over coffee. Music is smooth, and lyrics are pleasing and somewhat entrancing. Beat stays mellow but picks up mildly with some songs. I find this to be another great edition to the vast library of Putumayo music. If you like relaxing music with a touch more spunk then the average types then this'd be a good pick (IMO). I hope this post was helpful to you.Have a nice day."
5,Ahhh...nice...,"This has quickly become one of my favorite CDs. Great background music as I move through the day, and it has a wonderful way of settling me down in the evenings. I have not yet found a Putumayo sampler that hasn't made me happy! My son and I love the kids' ones with the ""Playground"" titles, too."
5,Almost my favorite putumayo cd,"Like the name of this review, it is almost my favorite one. I am extremely partial to their lounge cd's and this one comes in 3rd place of the best ones. Only Euro lounge and then world lounge are a bit better in the sense I can listen to them over and over for a week straight when driving (alternating for 1 radio station to the cd). But I can do the with this cd as well. Just depends on my mood. It is totally worth buying."
4,Fun,"Once you get past the ridiculous stiffness (on some tracks) of what can only be Japanese singing mixing into smooth modern lounge beats, its a really great album."
5,Impressive,"Erica rules. A long career in her native Argentina has been the prelude of a ""must be"" international success story. Recently she toured with Bunbury in Spain and everybody was astonished down there. In this CD you can find everything you look for: originality, great lyrics, cool voice, great arrangements... and yep, you can see the girl is hot too. Fav songs: ""Yo te todo"", ""No insistas"" and the beautiful ""Positiva""."
3,has some flaws,"The repertoire in this book is pretty good for classic rock fans. Of course, due to licensing restrictions it doesn't have EVERY great classic rock tune. There are some fatal flaws, however. The chords and lyrics are extremely small. Forget about using this book while playing live or jamming. The book would have been much better if it had been written in ""real book"" format instead of cramming all of the music and lyrics on one page. Also, songs that are tuned to E flat are sometimes notated as the actual chord shapes (without notating the tuning) and sometimes notated as the flatted chords. In other words, an open E chord would be notated as E flat. This is an awful thing to do to guitarists, especially on guitar based songs. I had to do a lot of crossing out and rewriting in chords. I also found a few of the chords to be incorrect when I went and learned them from CD. It's good as a reference for learning songs quickly, but you can't use it while playing."
2,Good Collection but beware Small Printed Pages,This fake book has many hits that I would love to be able to play.But this sheet music has such tiny printing that it makes the notes and key signatures dificult to read.I would have given this book 3 more stars if it had have the songs and bigger print.
3,What Happened to Steely Dan???????,"This is still a nice collection of classic rock tunes. However....if you're a Steely Dan fan like me, be aware that the Steely Dan tunes that appear in the table of contents on web site are NOT ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE BOOK. Big disappointment."
3,Disappointing,"In the item's description it doesn't say anything about it only being ""right-handed"". I never heard of a ""fake"" book before and I didn't know it's meaning until I opened it and didn't see the bass clef line, just the treble. It's a decent book if you just want to tinker around at home, but to actually learn the song, not so much."
3,"A little expensive, good for teaching",I was looking for books to use teaching guitar. There was a less expensive classic rock fake bookwhich is a much better deal. This is kind of expensive unless you are a baby boomer looking for asmany baby boomer songs as possible.
5,It's great!!,"This is a great album..best soundtrack I've ever heard. There are lots of great artists on here: Toad the Wet Sprocket, Soul Asylum, Our Lady Peace, and Din Pedals with Green Apple Quickstep being the sleeper...GAQ has a great sound!! All in all, the CD rocks!!!"
4,"This book was good, but the movie was great!!!",The movie was better than the movie scream 2. I read the book but i like movies way better. i recommend the movie and the book. i hope that they make a sequal to the movie. If they do they need to make it way better than the frist one. END
5,This is the best horror film soundtrack ever,"I really love this soundtrack, especially korn's song proud. It has really great music, and the movie rules also!!"
4,"I love the ""Summer Breeze"" song. It makes me feel fine.","Songs I like: Hush, Summer Breeze, D.U.I., Hey Bulldog, 2Wicky, and Proud. So out of 15 songs, I like 6. Which should only be three stars, but the ones I like are worth the upgrade."
5,"Good Movie, Great Soundtrack","Well, the movie isn't the best I've ever seen, but the soundtrack is fantastic. This was the c.d. that converted me to listen to alternative music, instead of country, which I used to love, but now detest. The song ""Summer Breeze"" is perhaps the best song on the album. I cant give the movie much credit though, it was o.k. for a teen slasher flick, but was a little lame in parts. However, whether or not you liked the movie doesnt matter, the soundtrack is excellent. Some of the artists on this album are not widely known, but provide some of the best songs on the c.d. If you are a true fan of the alternative music genre, or even the metal genre, this c.d. is a must have. Go buy it today!"
5,"It was a awesome, suspense thriller",This is the best book ive ever read in my life! But i have to say the movie was better. Im Jennifer Hewitt's biggest fan alive! END
2,A Psudo Gardner Tells HIS Tales,"The only thing that kept me from giving this book one star is that the first couple of pages taught me about Hybridizing - and why it's wrong - and somewhere in the middle there is information about how the European Community is having an affect on crop variety. The rest of this book is disorganized, and only speaks to the author's own vegetable intrests. From the sound of it, he's only gardened one season (the previous year) and wasn't able to discuss the results of most of his plantings becuase ""the season ended early"". Well, did you ever think you might have planted the seeds late?!?! This book should really be titled the ""John F. Adams failed expiriments at growing Corn, Beans & Fruit Trees."""
3,From Cincinnati,The picture frame works well but the remote does not work. We have tried to call Digital Spectrum and also have sent emails but have not received a response. Based on that I would never buy from them again
1,Quit working after 1 year,So sad. It quit working after 1 year after normal use. I do not recommend that you purchase this product.
1,Never Worked,"I received this item 2 Christmases ago and never opened it because it said it was for use on a PC. I recently contacted Mac and they said if the pictures were JPEG it should work. Opened the box, plugged it in and got a very funky screen. You can see in the uppermost right hand corner the screen that should appear but the rest of the screen is just a jumble of color, lines and blotches. Obviously something wrong with the screen. So I can't really comment on whether or not it would work with the Mac because it doesn't work at all. Very disappointed. Can't return it because it's been too long since receiving it. I would think that just sitting in a box shouldn't cause it to not work properly. I know for a fact I never dropped it. So, now it's garbage. Was looking forward to trying it out but that's not gonna happen now."
1,Don't buy and don't deal with the company!,"Company will not honor gifts that have warranties. We only have about 200 pictures on it and it freezes constantly. They have told us to re-format, etc. I would not recommend this product to anyone!!! Company told us that since I don't have a receipt (remember it was a GIFT) that they couldn't do a thing. I am disappointed that the warranty apparently isn't worth the paper it is written on, IF IT IS A GIFT! I wish I had a cheap one from Walmart since I know several people who do and they work wonderful!"
1,Stay away from DSI Products,"My mother's gift MemoryVue 800 worked for a month or so, then gave an error message and wouldn't show any photos. Long story short . . . I'm on my fifth replacement. Each unit stopped working after the unit was stopped and restarted. If NO STARS were an option, that's what I'd give. I've invested hours, repackaging the duds and hauling them to the PO. I'm waiting for the delivery of replacement #5 their ""new, plus"" model, supposedly. The company has an ""F"" rating from the Better Business Bureau so . . . . DON'T BUY DSI PRODUCTS!!!"
1,MemoryVue MV-800 digital picture frame,"I purchased two of these items, one for myself and one for a relative as a birthday gift. Both units failed after several months of use. Digital Pacific replaced my unit under the warranty. That too failed after an even shorter time period. These units were expensive to purchase. Obviously, there are some serious issues that are continually plaguing this model. I would not recommend purchasing this unit ever, and I would be very skeptical about purchasing a similar unit from this company."
4,Excellent gift,"Fantastic gift - the folks I gifted this to couldn't get over it, it was so good..Transforms your experience of digital photography...Amazing concept, and very good finishOnly thing not good enough is the instruction leaflet, but who needs that!?"
1,Where do the 2nd's go for LCD displays?,"Every LCD display mfgr ""bins"" their product. There is the ""perfect"" bin, the ""acceptable"" bin (maybe a hot red pixel in the lower right corner of the display) and finally the ""2nd's"" bin - two or more bad pixels or a cluster of bad pixels. Those get sold cheap.Then there are the engineers who work cheap and don't make a decent user interface that handles rotated images. Would seem simple - and obvious to the customer, but the engineer didn't have to do it so they didn't bother. The top notch engineers out of school designed supercomputers - the lowest notch design digital photo displays.Combine low quality parts, and low quality people - you get a low quality product out the back end. And the two page xeroxed manual is so appropriate for documentation it's the icing on the cake here. I'd look at other brands and use this if you must."
1,Not as good as the Phillips,"I purchaed this frame and the Phillips 7"" digital photo frame. The Phillips screen while smaller is much much better for displaying photos. I would highly recomend NOT getting this frame. Buy the Phillips due to screen clarity, picture quality, and ease of menu navigation. I liked the wood frame on this, and I liked the larger screen size, but it does not make up for the picture quality difference. One star due to an actual frame and matting and screen size, that is, it ""looks"" like a picture frame, rather than an LCD screen."
1,Only lasted about 6 months,"I bought this frame about 6 months ago. At first I loved it. The picture quality was great. It was simple to use. And with the external card, I could load lots of pictures into it.However, in the past few weeks, I've noticed color spots appearing in front of my pictures. At first it was one or two orange spots. Now there are hundreds in all different colors. I've tried to contact the company, but they haven't responded.I'm now totally sold on the digital picture frame concept. I'll replace this one, but not with anything from Digital Spectrum. I would encourage others to avoid this brand as well."
2,No customer service,"After two months the remote broke, Digital Spectrum refused to replace it stateing the seller wasn't an authorized seller, they have been no help in resolveing the problem I would discourage anyone from buying this product due to the uncareing additude of Digital Spectrum."
2,MV-800 not ready for prime time,"*Generally the look is okay, the fit & finish is poor. I had to disassemble & reassemble mine.*The feature set is a big plus. JPGs, AVIs, & MP3s in the same box is cool.*You can load an MP3 to play over a slideshow.*The MV-800 says it supports Microdrives, it does not (the slot is physically too small, and x-acto knife will fix the problem, but you may not be so inclined.)*The big problem is it does not show more than 511 photos. I am a photographer, and I have a few thousand photos to show. Upon attempting to load the 512th photo, it locks up, and needs to be power cycled.*Tech support is terrible. The phone number (888) 999-0732 is never answered, the messages are never returned.I give it 2 stars, because it will work for a person without microdrives, and only 511 pictures."
1,spots on second screen 3 months after replcing the 1st,"This product is faulty (a lemon), the first one stopped working after 5 months, they sent a new one after two months; that one developed spots on the screen two months later as others have reported.A waste of money and time."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"I bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents. Two of them stopped working. One of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped. In fairness to the manufacturer, they did replace the item even though it was out of warranty. Now I hope the replacement lasts longer."
1,"software is terrible, hardware is flakey, junk product","I bought a MemoryVue 1040 Plus from Costco. Several things disappoint me:* the side buttons don't work. You must use the remote control.* it won't copy files to the internal memory as advertized. It just gets an error. Even though I scaled the pictures to 800x600 about 140kB each, plain vanilla JPEG.* it is not recognized by my Windows XP box so I cannot put pictures on the internal memory. No driver disk is provided and no drivers are available on the manufacturer's web site.* picture quality is dissapointing. Bright highlights are washed out. The dynamic range is pretty poor. Only by severely processing the pictures in photoshop can you make them tolerable, but they are still pretty bad.* the documentation is terrible."
2,MV-800 limited to 512 images,"I have this picture frame and overall it is Ok. This picture frame is limted to displaying 512 images MAXIMUM, if you have more images than that, they may display, but the ability to repeat or re-loop them will fail. The manual does list this limitation, however you will not know this until after you purchase it, so I feel it is my duty to warn you in advance. Another problem is play back of Mpeg files, the audio lags behind the video by a couple seconds and really out of sync."
2,Don't bother buying this,"Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality. My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual). The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it. I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star. I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off."
3,Caveat emptor Mac users,"I couldn't figure out why the MV-800 would display pictures from my camera CF memory card and not one with pictures selected from iPhoto on my MacIntosh...the pictures I really wanted to see, and not the ones that just happened to be on the camera card...after emailing DSI technical support they explained that ""the MV800 will not play any file that is Mac based"" which I did not see in the product description...I had thought that a jpeg file was a jpeg file, but I was wrong."
1,Poor Quality & Poor Customer Service - do not buy!,"""Would be a nice product except mine was delivered with 3 bad pixels. I contacted the company and was initially told that ""ISO 9000 standards"" allow the LCD to have 3-4 bad pixels. After spending $200 on the product, I pushed and got them to send me a replacement. I waited about 3 weeksand was once again disappointed to find out that the new replacement also had three bad pixels... in completely different places on the screen.I tried to live with that because I loved the concept of a digitial frame. However, when I moved the frame to dust behind it, the entire screen went white and I have not been able to resolve it or see my images.The company does not seem at all concerned with customer satisfaction and I will be issueing a chargeback with the credit card company. This item is not worth $200. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy it... or anything from Pacific Digital."
2,Lifetime: Two Months,"Received as a Christmas present, dead by February 24. Well, actually, that's two months. Now all it does is flash an error message, and nothing I do gets it out of that mode.I liked it before it died on me."
3,"great book, but the tapes sometimes do more harm than good","The book itself is a great learning tool. Not fun, but it gets results. The four tapes, however, while harmonically and melodically accurate, seem to be missing something incredibly important: rhythm. The played examples are characterized by a rhythmic ambiguity that adds nothing but frustration to the experience. Dictation requires accuracy, and in a rhythmic sense there is very little of that here."
1,Listen and Scream,This book is a debacle. Take any first or second year college ear training class which uses this book and you will see why.
3,Eclectic,"What do you get when you combine some of the finest singer-songwriters with an acclaimed arrangers? You get this earthy, jazzy, self-stylized CDs.Will is able to collaborate with the songwriter's to envision the songs into a new sound--that does not take away from the original recordings.I'd rank it higher, but this style of jazz is not my favorite--but I appreciate the talent behind it."
3,"""Oldies"" jazz","Big Band Spectacular, Volume 2 is a CD of what I would call ""oldies jazz"". It uses a lot of clarinet and flute and just has that early-1900s feel to it. I usually am not a big fan of this kind of jazz; I prefer slightly more modern titles like Route 66 and Jungle Boogie. But this CD was definitely one worth buying.With classics like Stompin' at the Savoy, Chattanooga Choo-Choo, and In The Mood, this is a well put-together album that utilizes the best of Glen Miller and Benny Goodman, two of my favorite jazz composers. While some songs are dry and uninteresting, there are lively numbers, too, ones I can bop around to while doing chores around the house. If you enjoy jazz and don't mind some ""old"" stuff, this is a CD you should buy for yourself."
3,pretty good,blackstreet and teddy riley had some cuts. i dug the first album the most of there records. the Dave Hollister era was the main Blackstreet era for me. no diggity was the jam. before i let go and joy were my cuts. pretty good overall in the post new jack era.
1,"Very, very bad!!","This is just a terrible movie. The acting is horrible and there is no story line at all. The actors, as part of the movie, just keep saying ""the toe tags are missing"". Big deal like that statement is suppose to be scarey. Try some other B movie in the horror genre. Don't even rent this one!!!!"
5,Get the real stuff!!!,"This Anime-series is great!!!!! The story is a mix from 18th century lifestyle, upcoming 19th century technique, the story: 20.000 Leagues under the Sea from Jules Verne and a good portion Si-Fi.....You get it all! The love, the submarine, the action, the fun and the tension of a fast-paced, hard-hitting storyline!Thats FUN!! Get into the world of Jean and Nadia!!You will love it!!"
4,"Great socks with ""unique"" stitching","These are terrific running/cycling/workout socks at a tremendous value. Be prepared, however, for controversial events or causes sewn into the ankle of the sock. Although none are offensive, they may be inconsistent with the purchaser's values. For some, these labels may reduce one's enthusiasm for wear."
1,Wrong Item - Don't Buy These,"When this item arrived a week ago, I was disappointed that there was only one pair of socks despite the description of three pairs. I contacted Amazon customer service and they promptly sent a replacement, again only one pair of socks. Since the two pairs of socks that I did receive were high-quality, I requested that I keep these as fulfillment of my order. Three emails later, Amazon refused my request and indicated that I should return the items at their cost. While I am not out any money, it was a hassle to return the items. I order a lot from Amazon, once or twice a week on average. They have the best customer service department of any website that I have dealt with. However, they let me down on this one and I am disappointed with Amazon. They need to change their website. If you order this item, you will receive one pair of socks."
4,Solid IR block,This IR block from Buffalo is a good option for any IR system. I have used the IR-100 on multiple jobs and haven't had any issues with performance.
2,Didn't work with Samsung LN46B550 LCD HDTV and HD TiVo,"This didn't work at all with a Samsung LCD HDTV and an HD TiVo. The TV created interference that overwhelmed the IR sensor and generated too strong a signal in the IR flasher that the TiVo wouldn't accept. I could get it to work intermittently by wrapping the IR flasher in paper to degrade the signal, but then it wouldn't work for the first minute after turning on the TV. It also wouldn't work if I pointed the remote directly at the IR receiver. I had to point it off axis to make it work.After talking with an infrared hardware expert where I work, I instead purchased a XANTECH 49085DKit LCD-Proof Designer Micro Link Infrared Kit, which is specifically designed to filter out interference from LCD TV's and compact fluorescent lights. It works perfectly no matter what direction I point the remote, and I'm a lot happier now.I recommend buying this instead:XANTECH 49085DKit LCD-Proof Designer Micro Link Infrared Kit"
3,razor cover,"Unfortunately for me, the clip broke off the back immediately. I selected that particular cover because it had a clip. The cover works fine, the clip attachment was substandard."
4,Nice napkins...,"Although you should probably follow the washing instructions to a T. I washed on cold but tumble dried low instead of air dried, and they seemed a little less vibrant than when they were 100% new."
2,Regency with added imagination,Personally I skimmed parts of this book. I still haven't made my mind up whether the hero or the heroine had less brains. I think for me the heroine is slightly ahead on lacking common sense. There is the hero's faithful groom who deceives the hero etc.You may like it after all this author has published a number of books but personally I was uncomfortable with it.
5,family games paradux,"Looks interesting. Very well made, especially considering how the price of wooden games is increasing, and lower quality along with the increase. This is nice."
4,My paradux was four or five stars?,"Another unique twist on the four in a row game concept, as you must move your opponents pieces along with yours. The peices and the board are very well made and the game is simple to learn and yet is pure skill and great fun. Held off on giving it five stars, only because the GIPF series of games has taken this concept further and those games offer greater depth. Better than One UP for two players, both are nice additions to this series."
4,"Great content, terrible binding",Binding broke away from spine after briefly flicking through the book. It appears with extended use the cover will tear away from the pages. Pictures/diagrams need refinement; some look as if they were printed on a bubblejet printer which was low on ink.Overall coverage of mounting systems is fantastic!
4,optics book,book was just what i needed. the book came with cd and in good shape and I received quickly after ordering.
4,[]review,"This single from Matt Hales is perhaps one of the more upbeat and commercially viable tracks from his debut album, yet it still retains what is fast becoming his trade mark of prog based ambient electronica. Dubbed as the 21st centuries answer to Moby, 'Good Times Gonna Come' displays beautifully simple music arrangements, that build throughout the song with layering effects and haunting vocal melodies.Not instantly a striking song that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, its listenabilty improves the more you play it and you can constantly find new little features in the track. The dramatic soaring vocals of the chorus appear ghost like in their fragility and the soft melancholy is defiantly soothing; buy it to listen while driving and you won't suffer from road rage.Mat"
1,Ever heard of the Smithees?,"Okay, I became aware of this movie through the Smithees. The Smithees are an award show put on at gaming conventions like Orgins. Only a true geek knows what I am talking about but the basis of the Smithees is to award the truly worst of the worst yes this movie was 2006 winner. Of all the movies the group saw and we watched movies for a long time this was the worst. It is up in 2007 Orgins Smithee 5 year award which means it has the ability to be the worst over the last 5 years. So if you are looking for a classic B movie this is not it.However if you want pointless nudity, no plot at all, hard to follow script (ladies the men in this movie are not that hot and mostly over ugh) this is your film. So get the popcorn and laugh till your side hurts because you will."
3,Put a smile on my face,"Well it was a long time waiting for this to come to it's full release, and It put me in a good mood to finally see it done. Thanks for the entertainment.Former Monster Rangler,Peter Krause"
4,The Definitive Third...,"...particularly when listening to the timpani advancing, then in impish retreat, and the ""battery"" of flutes just rising in seeming defiance over the rest of the orchestra towards the end, and these of only the first movement; then the hauntingly heralding horns of the third... vielen Danke, Herr Bohm. Karajan's interpretation of the Ninth is incomparable however, with its great cascading waves and stifling apian swarms rising to prophesy the coming of that maddening frenzy..."
3,"Many Major Chuckles, One Giant Guffaw","Susan Vass' tiny tome is a nice distraction. If the book is anything like the commedianne's standup act it might be better to miss it. The stories are pleasant enough and there is one good laugh, but not a memorable one. The most positive thing about the book is its absence of trashy language. For that, the stories that might appeal more to the middle-aged housewife audience should be applauded."
2,Much better books out there,I thought at times it was trite and she was just talking about nothing. Pick up the classic by Dale Carnegie and you can't go wrong. I felt schmoozed over.
5,Excellent Art Book,"Both the artwork and the text in this book are outstanding. It would make a great ""coffee table"" book simply because of its beauty, but it offers so much more for the serious student of art. For the artist, it offers an insight into the ideas and development of Degas as an artist and a view into his world. The reproductions, while never as dramatic as the real paintings, are true to color and intensity and cover a wide range of Degas' work. The text is well researched and written and covers both the biographical and artistic aspects of the man."
3,Good for a High School design class but not professionals,Perhaps the target audience for this book is absolute beginners and that's how I'm rating it. It's niether great nor bad for that level of reader. If you're looking for something more serious or professional then go with Tufte's books.
4,informative,Very informative text written for the lay person. I am a grad student and this is my favorite textbook in the LIS program.
5,"Rafael Kubelik's Earlier, Legendary Schumann Symphony Cycle","Fans of Deutsche Grammophon's superb sound quality will not want to miss this budget price two CD set of Rafael Kubelik conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in this critically acclaimed Schumann symphony cycle. Some critics regard this as among the finest Schumann symphony cycles ever recorded. However, this accolade should be given for the quality of the recording, not the performances. Although all of the Berlin Philharmonic's performances are first rate, they still fall short in warmth, enthusiasm, if not techique, in comparison to Kubelik's later recordings with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. In deferrence to Kubelik's later cycle, this one should merit four and a half, not five stars."
4,I Agree With John Kwok,"Although all of the Berlin Philharmonic's performances are first rate, they still fall short in warmth, enthusiasm, if not technique, in comparison to Kubelik's later recordings with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. In deference to Kubelik's later cycle, this one should merit four and a half, not five stars.Since there is no 1/2 rating available, I gave it 4 stars. Good description; ""lack of warmth""."
2,Didn't Survive The Desert,"Do not buy this unless you are going to be in the best of weather. It will not survive any sort of wind. I spent one night in it and the next night found it torn to pieces by the wind before we ever made it to bed. There are not enough guy points (a nearly identical $200 model by another manufacturer has twice the guy points) and the guylines and stakes provided are inadequate. The pole had gone through the floor and the pole was bent in half and the pole joints were jammed together. One of the guypoints had also torn out. Mine was tossed in the dumpster on the way home. It's a good tent if you are certain the weather is going to be calm or you can do as I did, beg a bunk in a friend's motorhome."
4,A World Beyond,"I read this book MANY years ago and wanted to read it again. I've recommended this to many people and will continue to do so. First of all, you must read this with an open mind; and secondly, it gives the reader a whole new look about the afterlife! I highly recommend it!"
3,A World Beyond,"I have read almost all of her other books and wanted to glimse the future with this one. Not so, very vague, save your money"
1,Book is outdated and boring.,"Well, I have struggled to get through the first couple of chapters, and I feel as though I am reading a Doctor Suess book. I think this was written in a time where science was not known to very many, therefore it was written to appease the layman. I was hoping for a little more than, ""if you are bad, this happens, or if you commit suicide than this happens"". No matter what, people still equate the afterlife to what is known here on earth. Well, sorry to say, but I think it would be alot broader than ""Trees being more green, people going fishing, etc..."" Sorry to bring this down, but I think we know more about our universe and other religions now to put this book back on the shelf. Glad I bought it used."
3,Out of date,"Out of date, old. Good if all you want is a discussion of the certification process. I highly recommend Ian K. Fisher's ""How to Start a Career in Information Technology""."
4,These tatted snowflakes were are a delight to find.,"The individual photographs are close enough to count the stitches without using the written patterns. The designs range from beginning to advanced skills. Instructions about the process of tatting are clear and easy to follow. It can be difficult to learn to tat from a book, but not impossible. There are two 2-dimensional snowflakes and a few with beads and ribbons, perfect for holiday decorations."
4,Nice Snowflake patterns,"This has a good selection of patterns for tatting snowflakes. I found the written patterns a bit hard to decipher, but the pictures are clear which helps."
5,great patterns,"this book of tatted snowflakes has a great range of snowflakes. from small simple ones to elegant difficult ones. the patterns are written well and easy to explain. i recommend this book for tatters of all skill level because it has simple ones then they could work their way up, great book and i definitely recommend this.... also another note... don't let the pictures discourage you! some of them don't look too inspiring... remember you are able to exclude outer rounds sometimes and create new ones... don't get hung up on the photos like i did...get this book"
3,"Please all, please none","It's got straight sex, lesbian sex, a LOT of anal sex, gay male sex, domination, rape, murder, B&D, S&M and bestiality. One of the rape victims is constantly worried about what might be happening to her ""little girl,"" though the girl in question turns out to at least LOOK over 16. What it doesn't have is any hint of affection between the players. I was hoping for something that focused on the type of sex I like, rather than trying to please every preference under the sun. At least the male member is pleasingly present, though often attached to men no vanilla-romantic would touch with gloves on!"
2,Not for the faint of heart,"This book has two stories.The first is fun and I enjoyed it..it is silly and sexy.The second one one is only for those whose fetish is torture, not SM, but just torture. I like kinky sex. I do not like debasement. Do not read this if you have any Sexual abuse issues."
5,Elegance at an affordable price!,"These glasses are lovely! They are about 7"" tall, so they fit beautifully in the dishwasher. They are somewhat heavy, so they don't topple over easily--and that's important when you have a crowded table! They are a bit thick at the rim, but I think the tradeoff is far outweighed by the benefits."
4,Pretty Good Pirate Costume!,This costume was a lot nicer than your typical Halloween store pirate costume. Quality much better. The red jacket you see pictured has some great detailing. The sizing and size charts were right on too. The hat could have been made a little better - it fit crooked on my son's head and kept falling off. Costume is a little more expensive but probably worth it if you think your kid is going to wear this more than just once on halloween.
1,Junk,"What junk. Gross substance that I guess was supposed to be fabric except felt to cheap to even qualify as fabric. Very small for the size range. Difficult to put on so it won't have any life after Halloween. Shirt ripped when my 2 year old put it on, straight through the aforementioned gross fabric. No hat. Couldn't even return it. Bah.Creative Education of Canada makes a good easy on pirate vest. Try and find it instead."
1,Very upset...my nephew comes to town tomorrow and this product came open with missing eye patch!,"I just received my package and I am really upset because the costume was open and missing the eye patch. They probably got a return from another client and just put the product back in stock without checking. Now I have to hurry up to a store and try to find something. Another complain is that the costume DOESN'T INCLUDE A HAT...they shouldn't show a kid with a hat as the product picture, if it's not part of the costume."
4,Nice quality for the price,"This is a nice quality costume for the price. I bought the size Large for my 8 year old, who wears a size 8 pants and size 3 1/2 shoes. The costume was quite large on him, and I had to add elastic to the sleeves so he could use his hands. The Medium would have been a better fit, but it worked, and we may use the same costume next year!My only complaint is that the boot covers barely fit over his shoes. They seemed to be for toddler shoes. Luckily, they were the same color as his shoes. Otherwise, he probably would not have been satisfied."
1,oof...pretty sure it's flamable!,"I bought this based on reviews and a fairly cute picture... BIG MISTAKE!!!It is CHEAP and CHEEZY!!! I would NEVER let my son wear the shirt or pants- they are made of some horrible, nasty, flimsy polyester. In short, the under part of the costume is worthless... it is nothing but an atrocious looking fire hazard!!! The hat has velcro that won't stay put, the boot things are completely lame and look like weird bear feet, the eye patch is cheap... the only almost redeeming thing about the costume is the coat because it looks good and contains some trace amount of cotton fabric.All in all, one star for the fact that I didn't pay the $70 list price!"
3,The beginning of Johto really,"It is not rather a bridge but the beginning of the discovery of Johto.Pokemon the movie 2000 features ten Johto creatures - inc. Marill, Sunflora, Bellosom, Elekid and Lugia, and this movie is based on the Orange Island adventures. Supporting this are three factors:1) We discover a Johto creature; Marill2) The GS Ball (Gold/Silver Ball, i.e. Johto)3) At the end of the series, we see their actual entry into Johto country, but they know something about it before arriving at Oak's at the end.It is good this DVD, but sometimes it lacks the action that we all like; i.e. trainer battles, and those in which Pikachu does not take part. Also Team Rocket need to get an Onix if they are ever going to win. We need more of this to keep Pokemon alive."
3,"Great Performance, Horrible Recording","This is so sad. We have the best orchestra in the world at the time this was recorded, a fine conductor, and a fantastic piece of music ... all ruined by the recording. The concerns expressed in the other reviews about an artificial vibrato or ""wobble"" in the strings are very real. I couldn't get past it and enjoy the performance, but when I put this recording on in the background, certain moments jump out at me as being beyond compare. I'll have to go with the Chicago Symphony's performance of Mahler's 9th with Boulez as the best, or perhaps the new Berlin recording with Rattle. If they could ""fix"" this recording, it would certainly be the best."
5,Un Guante!!!!,"Eso es lo que son estos zapatos Bostonian. Conocidos por su indudable calidad y confort, ese modelo está a la altura de mis expectativas. Con un estilo ""casual elegante"" o ""smart casual"" como dicen los norteamericanos. Funciona bien tanto con trajes de trabajo diario como con ropa casual. Son super cómodos!!!!"
5,A great violinist playing great music.,Itzhak Perlman demonstrates his mastery of the violin while playing Pablo de Saratate's 'Carmen Fantasy' on this CD.
5,An awesome vehicle to usher you into God's presence,I absolutely adore this CD! It is one that you can play over and over again and never tire of. There is an excellent combination of upbeat and slow songs that express well the feelings we have toward our heavenly Father. I definitely recommend it for the audio library of every serious worshipper.
5,"Great music - Upbeat, substantial and right on target","This is my first Christian music CD and I just love it. The music and lyrics are first rate, varied and will keep you humming them all day long. This music brings you closer to the Lord. It makes you realize how lightweight FM music is."
5,AWESOME CD!!!!!,"VERY INSPIRATIONAL, YOU CAN FEEL THE PRESENCES OF THE LORD IN ALL OF THE SONGS. I LOVE THE SONG SHOUT TO THE LORD."
5,I just love this book,"Liebling is a wonderful writer, and I've read this book several times. If the subject of Paris in the Twenties is of interest to you, then you will love this. It's in a class with Glassco's ""Memoirs of Montparnasse,"", Hemingway's ""A Movable Feast,"" and Morley Callahan's memoir. (Can't recall the name right now.) Liebling, however, didn't associate with artists and writers or anyone famous. But he ATE. (Not expensively, but well.)"
4,Great Read!,"Since Im a longtime ""Foodie"" this book was especially a very enjoyable read! I would encourage anyone interested in food, in the slightest, purchase this book, and pass it along to others as well."
4,A Treat,"Did anyone ever love Paris, or at least eating in Paris, like Liebling. I share his love for the city and for the cuisine. Perhaps this colors my view but I really enjoyed this book."
3,If only they had followed what the game had already done....,"I've played Wing Commander since I was 11, with the original game. I own, and played every game since then. (Up to Wing Commander Secret Ops). I would categorize myself as a die-hard fan. So when I heard the news of the movie, I jumped for joy and blasted myself to the nearest Movie Theater. If you didn't play the original game, you wouldn't appreciate this movie. And even then, they threw allot of odd balls into it, which wasn't in the original game. I feel if they have followed what the game had already done, people would have loved it. And what's the deal with the ships?! They've turned my Tigers Claw into a World War 2 sub in space.. And the fighters are all gatlinguns with wings, if they had kept the same ship designs things would have rocked.. I feel the only reason to buy/own this movie is to add it to someone existing Wing Commander collection."
2,No thrill,"I spent probably hundreds of hours playing Wing Commander 1. I can still recall all the thrill of the action, patrols, dog fighting, etc. Then personalities - how I hated Maniac sometimes for his stupid behavior! Unfortunately the movie brings nothing from that thrill. It's just an average sci-fi movie loosely tied to the original computer game. I believe that they had to make stronger connections with the game. For thousands of people this movie could become a nostalgic memory of the action one could no longer feel but it didn't."
2,Poor plot.,"""Wing Commander"" computer games are awesomw,but when I saw the film,I was very dissapointed. I'm baffled as to why Freddie Prinze JR and David Warner would do a film with so little plot.The film is obviously tries to make for the lack of plot by bringing in nice visual effects.""Wing Commander"" tries to bring in drama and suspense but fails miserably like it did at the box office. ""Wing Commander"" is good if your looking for good action and good C.G.I. effects,but lacks in every other department.Good rental,but not worth buying."
2,"Not a total Loss, but a bad Sci-Fi movie.","Science fiction is a very wonderful thing. It is very thought provoking and makes us think about society and ourselves. It should also relate to us, by having good characters and a good story. Special effects can only highten the experience, but special effects alone can't make a movie, and that's what WING COMMANDER does.Sure, it can be fun and it has great special effects, but it has bad characters, played by actors who can't seem to get the parts down, only because they were handed a bad script.YOU WILL LIKE THIS IF: You are looking for a fun movie with good special effects and a lot of action.YOU WILL HATE THIS IF: You enjoy thought provoking Science Fiction with good characters, good story, and a good script.BOTTOM LINE: Don't take it seriously, or you will not enjoy it."
1,the game series has been scarred,"Here's the deal, I actually LOVE the video games. Even the newer ones with all the video in them have presented fun gameplay and good stories.Unfortunately, this film left me with such a bad taste that I can barely compare it to the games. Avoid this one. Halfway through I was ready to leave the theare (unfortunately I was with friends who wanted to stay).I could literaly watch ever scene of this movie and point out bad acting, bad special effects, and just plain ludicrous science at work (ships crash in outerspace but do not float?). Anyway, listen to what everyone has been telling you and avoid this movie.Play the great games instead."
1,"Oh, God. Please kill me.","I work at a video store. I got Wing Commander for free, but strangely, I still feel ripped off. Horrible acting (except from Protchnow and Burroughs), story, effects and an overall lack of energy make this one of the worst films I've ever seen. I want the 90 minutes of my life back."
1,"Bad, bad, bad and then even more bad","Throw out everything good about the Wing Commander games and what's left will be the Wing Commander movie. It's got bad acting, bad special effects, bad dialouge and a bad story. Save yourself a few bucks and a headache and go buy the WCIII game from K-Mart's bargin bin -- you'll enjoy it more."
1,This movie proves there is no God,"This was the most awful movie I have ever seen. Freddie Prinze's acting range goes from stupified...to dumbfounded! The plot is nonexistant and the characters are virtually unlikeable, much less well developed! The only reason to watch this movie in the theater was for the Episode 1 preview. Now that it's almost out on video, save a few precious moments of your life and just go see Star Wars."
4,Wing Commander,"I liked this movie, as I have played the game too. It brought back memories. This movie is for the youngerperspective, but still shows a point of view for young and old."
4,Wing Commander,"Good old movie, nice to have it in my collection. Just think, Fred and Shaggy in Space! Well worth the money."
4,An uninformed critique,"Yes. Chris Roberts can't direct; If you've played any of the WC games you'll know this. But WC is cool, and so is this film."
2,You can lead a director to water...,"Some of the space battle scenes are pretty good but the film as a whole is blech!!How could they screw this one up?? I mean, did anyone involved with the movie play any version of W.C.? The fighters in the movie look ridiculous and Freddie Prinz Jr. was a terrible choice for the lead. I love the scene where the good guys are hiding on an asteroid and a Kilrathi battlecruiser is passing over. Jurgan Prochnow tells everyone to be quiet since any sound might give them away....IN SPACE?? Hoo-boy, what a dumb technical gaff."
1,The HORROR!~!~!,"Some things in life will make you question God's sanity. This is one of them. If, while viewing it, you experience a dull pain behind your eyes--not to worry, that's just your brain slowly dying from exposure to such a vacuum of intelligence as this film is. I sincerely doubt that whomever wrote this script even had a central nervous system, much less a brain. Please, for my sake, for your brain's sake, avoid this ""movie""."
1,My Eight Year Old Niece's Review,"""Uncle, there's something WRONG with this movie.""I took my niece along with some of her cousins to see this movie when it first came out in theatres, mostly because it was the only movie that was playing that wasn't rated R. She said the above quote to me towards the end of the movie, and boy, was she on target: There WAS something wrong with Wing Commander - it SUCKED. Bad. Her review was one of the best, most succinct, not to mention funniest movie reviews I've ever heard. Wing Commander isn't even worth the $4.97 Amazon is charging for it, and it's definitely not worth the 100 minutes of your life it will take to watch it."
1,One of the worse sci-fi movies ever.,"This movie was one of the worse sci-fi films I had ever seen.The acting was boring and so was the storyline.Where were and who are the bad guys during most of the movie?I like Battlestar Galactica and the two earlier Star Wars movies better because they tell more and give more exposure to the bad guys than Wing Commander.Only the special effects gets high marks.In an earlier review I announced I am working on my own space war epic and had I written Wing Commander I would had done a better job not only with the writing,but the casting."
4,Wing Commander,Great movie for watching late at night. If you like Sci-Fi then this would be a good one to sit and watch.
1,Did I miss something?,"I saw the movie Wing Commander and all I have to say is,""What the hell was that? "" the acting was terrible the story was bad and there were more plot holes than swiss cheese in it. They never explained why the ""Pilgrims"" were so hated or feared during the movie. They explained that they were ""God Like"" with there abilities but they didn't say what they did to upset everyone if anything. They just needed to put a conflict between a high ranking oficer and the main character that his abilities will come into play later on in the movie which will save everyone and all will be forgivin. I like the fact that they based the ships and the plans after WW2 subs and planes. that was pretty nice but other than that....I can't think of one good reason why anyone would want to rent or buy this movie. Best to launch this film into deep space and hope no intelligent life finds this."
4,Great Little Overlooked B Movie,"In my opinion this is a great little B movie that is often overlooked. If you are looking for a great Sci Fi film with fantastic acting, great character development, etc., then you are in the wrong place. This is a B movie where most of the actors are unkowns. They do their best to pull off their one dimensional characters and for the most part are passable. There are exceptions both good and bad. There are a few big name actors who help carry the story, but most of the major actors are not that great, just like you'd expect in a B movie. I watch this movie every few years, partly because I was a fan of all of the Wing Commander games and I like how this sometimes tells part of the story (yes I know there are differences, but I'm not bothered by that as some are). Besides that, it's just a fun, little adventure. A guilty pleasure for a Sci Fi fan like me. Definitely worth a look if you like predictable, B movies with some science fiction adventure to them."
2,Tiny movie,"Film is over cropped, shows up as tiny rectangle in the middle of screen. You can zoom to fit but will lose partial image on one side."
2,The Wing Commander reveiw,"Wing Commander, made in 1999 was a good film. It wasn't great and It wasn't very good, though. The movie stars ""She's All That"" stars Matthew Lillard and Freddie Prinze, JR. both good friends. The movie also includes ""Deep Blue Sea's"" Saffron Burrows. Any way, the plot of the movie is kind of lame. It's just about two fighter Soldiers (Lillard, Prinze) fighting in war against an evil cult of Aliens. The movie is hardly realistic with Freddie Prinze Jr's character. He is supposed to be a large big hero, but infact, usually in warcraft there is really not a big hero. Matthew Lillard (maniac) is some silly pilot who never gets a second chance. I suggest in your best interest that you don't see the movie unless your a big Sci fi alien buff."
4,A rousing action adventure with stupid script.,I really enjoyed this movie mainly because of the production design and the special effects.
4,Good movie if you are a huge Wing Commander fan.,An ok movie for the average sci-fi fan but the only people who can really appreciate it are Wing Commander fans. They will be kinda disappointed though. I would also recommend to wait for the price to go lower than 30 schamollians.
3,It was OK,"I loved the games so I thought I would love the movie. Let me explian it all boils down to one word PILGRAMS. The concept for this group of wandering vagaonds who explored the stars was totally laugable. The acting and dialog are also 3rd rate but it does well to kill some time.My impression-I wanted very much to like this movie and I do somewhat, however I don't see one bit of difference between the movie and an episode of Dawson's Creek(only with spaceships)"
2,"Great Special Effects, Not So Great Story","The special effects in this latest offering to sci-fi fans are certainly up to snuff, and the artwork is also remarkable in this big screen adaptation of the popular computer game and books. Being a fan of the Wing Commander series of books however, I was more than a little disappointed that so little effort was made to stick to the established story lines. Granted it was interesting to see young Christopher Blair's first deployment (seeing as he's one of the great heroes of the whole story), but it was ruined by the whole Pilgrim angle on the story line. In addition, screwing up the character of James Taggart (aka 'Paladin') did nothing to aid the progress of the plot. All in all, not to bad for those not already familiar with the established story line, but a lukewarm offering to fans of the game and the books."
5,If you liked the game...,I loved the video games. I had this on VHS and wanted to upgrade to DVD. This was a must have in my collection..
1,Give me the GAME!!,"I saw this in the theatres, and was completely and utterly disappointed. Almost everything that made the game fun and its cinematics intriguing is missing here. The games had better actors and a darker tone than the ""oh-wow-look-at-me-I'm-in-a-CGI-scene"" feel of this (junk). I tried to take the movie on its own terms, but just couldn't let go of the fact that the material had taken a step down from its roots rather than a step up (for comparison, look at TV's atrocioius intrepretation of You Don't Know Jack). I still can't figure why they went with different actors. McDowell, Hamill, Wilson and the others in the game at least lent a gave a sense of gravity to the events swirling around them. The ships looks better in the game, and even, dare I say it, the Kilrathi. Bottom line: Boot your PC up in DOS mode (if you still remember how) and pop in WingCommander 3 or 4. Leave this ""film"" on the shelf or have a stiff drink when you catch it on cable."
3,Could have been better...,"Well there were a few things that I disliked about the movie adaptation of the game. For one about all of the budget in special effects and design must have been drastically low as compared to the amount they probably paid the actors to star in it. The ships look like modified WWII fighter jets and the carriers like submarines. None of the ships look anything like those in the games. Freddie Prinze Jr. does a pretty good job as Christopher Blaire and Saffron Burrows has a pathetic french accent (as Angel was french). The guy who plays Paladin also lacks the proper Scottish accent. They went for the well known actors but didn't go for the stuff that made the game great. I suggest renting it when you want to watch it or wait till the price goes down to about $13 if your a Wing Commander fan. Otherwise, have at it."
4,Blockbuster movie,"Wing Commander is one of the best sci-fi movies ever. It revives the classic feeling of the WWII movies with a futuristic twist. Plenty of classic elements like torpedoes and radar(not ""sensors""). This movie has a dynamite soundtrack (If you ever get the soundtrack, you'll wear it out in no time). This is a must for war-savvy film nuts!!"
4,Much better than negative reviews would indicate.,"I nearly didn't see this movie, and I'm a big sci-fi fan (and scientist). I read review after negative review, some saying this was the worst movie of all time. Then one day I noticed my wife was watching it on DirectTV. She said she had just watched for the third time and was anticipating watching it again. Afer hearing that I immediately purchased the DVD. (My wife has good taste.) I enoyed this movie very much. It has a sense of time and place that most sci-fi adventure movies lack. The acting was good and the plot was derivative but adequate. I just wish these movies would get the physics right. (Spacecraft don't fly like airplanes!) Lucas started a very bad precedent..."
3,Worth a look.,"While it's no Star Wars, Wing Commander is a fun movie who's plot is not nearly as thin as the reviewer would make it out to be. As a fan of the game series, I did have a hard time, at first, getting into the idea of the characters having been recast for the big screen, but Prinze and Lillard definately live up to their respective roles. Maybe everyone is right... maybe it does require a love of the Wing Commander game to enjoy this flick, but personally, as a die-hard sci-fi fan, I feel I would have enjoyed it as much had I never been exposed to the game."
1,This movie STINKS!,"Let's think about this for a second. Why would somebody make a movie out of a video game? Why not a video game out of a movie. This movie seems to concentrate moreover on the shock value of the tough life in space (suprisingly similar to life on an aircraft carrier. The effects are pretty cool, but they have weird timing. If you want to see a movie with a good plot and great special effects, see The Matrix"
1,I must have watched a different movie,"Stay away from this movie.The acting is terrible, I was just waiting for the Captain to put on a Napoleon hat and say that he will revenge Waterloo.The effects are mediocre, they should have invested in some Pentiums instead of using second hand 486 machines to work them.The musical score was terrible, there is so much wrong with it I cannot pin it down to just one bad part.Chris Roberts should stick with making computer games and not trying to direct a movie. He cannot inspire actors to truly act. He needs to understudy with some real director before he goes on and tries this again.The character Paladin is supposed to have a Scottish or English accent, they have some one that sounded more French or German than anything else.If you want to see a decent, Earth is in trouble from some aliens with good effects movie, Get Starship Troopers. That one at least is supposed to be campy."
1,Painfully Wrong,"I am a rabid fan of the computer game series, and eagerly went to see this movie when it came out. Boy was I disappointed. If you don't know the games at all, you might find the movie worthwhile, but those familiar with the games will find that the movie radically departs from the game storyline. The only similarities are the character names. Pilgrims? There are no pilgrims in the real (game) WC universe. I'm amazed that the movie was made like this since it was written by the creator of the games."
1,How could you understand this movie?,"I do not ever understand how anyone could get anything from this film. I have watched over 200 movies that year. I watched this and I could not figure out what the enemy is trying to do until he's dead. I'm guessing it's because I haven't played this video game before but if that's so, then this movie's only for those fans. I hope the video game isn't as boring and dry as the movie."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","In all my years of seeing movies(13 years) I have never seen a movie shot down more than this one. But it isn't that bad.It not the best video game movie of all time. Mortal Kombat is. But the movie had some life to it. Being a fan of movies like Star Wars, Top Gun, Starship Troppers, I though this movie was about two stars less then them(They are all five star movies).Why did the movie do so bad? Simple:1) Do adults go to see video game movies? No. 2) People walk in and say ""An appetizer for Star Wars"", and leave. 3) No big name actors. 4) Movie was too short(Good sci-fi's last 2 hrs). 5) The beginning was a bit boring, which gets people leaving the theatre before the movie gets good. It didn't get good until about 45 minutes through the movie. 6) Matthew Lillard's (Maniac) overreacting to his friend's death.But I think that despite all of the above, the movie had some life to it, and to be honest, I've seen, or know about, 50 other movies that were worse than this."
4,Good movie could be better,"when I first saw this movie I was captivated by the special effects and the storyline. But being a big fan of the PC game I think a few things could have been better. First with the characters Paladin should have remained an Irishman, Angel was the one who was supposed to be a french woman. Although I think they did a good job at portraying Maniac's wild persona. Second, the fight scenes, in the gun battle on the Kilrathi ship the fighting just wasn't intense enough for me. there wasn't a sense of ergency that I was expectiong. It would have also been cool to see what the Kilrathi looked like in thier fighters and see thier perspective. Lastly the ending. I was left a little dissapointed. Now I've heard rumors of a second WC movie and if this is true there was no lead in to the next movie. It just kinda stops. But the ending goes pretty well with the quality of the movie. all in all I liked it."
1,get the game please!!!!!!!,not a movie for you if you have never played the game. better ships may help the movie. but better story line on the wc games.
2,It's a shame that the computer games were better movies ...,"Terrible. A slap in the face to Wing Commander fans, and sci-fi fans in general. This had the potential to be so much more (as shown by the PC games)."
3,"Not true to the game, but not bad","Fans of the original games will be a little disappointed I think. After playing the last few games with full video cut scenes, you get used to certain actors playing the roles of Blair, or Maniac, etc. In the movie, all of that changes, the background changes some, etc. So if you are expecting it to fall in line with the video games..it ain't going to happen.If you haven't been playing the games, and you are a sci-fi fan, I think you will like the movie. Pretty descent plot, some awesome special effects, good music. The acting isn't bad, what can you expect from Freddie Prinz Jr. and Mathew Lilliard..."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I am a fan of the Wing Commander computer game series, and a fan of Sci-Fi in general. This movie, however, fails to offer anything worthwhile. It does not follow the perfectly good plot outlined in the computer games (the most recent of which are true interactive movies), instead substituting a story so flimsy and cheap that a bright 4th grader could have written it. The special effects and sound effects are truly wretched, and quite obviously computer-generated. The spaceflight sequences are unrealistic, and seem to be reminiscent of the old Flash Gordon movies, where you could see the string holding up the rocket ship. The Kilrathi, the aliens, look like shaved cats that have been lightly scorched. In the computer games, the Kilrathi parts are played by actors in costumes that look something like bipedal tigers (with full hair). The overall result is a dissapointment to the average moviegoer, and an even bigger one for those that play, and love, the games."
1,Brain Dead Space Opera,"I rented the video for myself and my ten-year-old son after seeing an ad on TV. What a mistake! We are both diehard fans of sci-fi classics like ""Terminator"" and ""Star Wars"" but this piece of trash had us yawning after the first ten minutes. Drawing upon the uncomplicated wisdom of youth, my son pronounced this flick ""boring"", and I can find no reason to disagree with his observation. ""Wing Commander"" is nothing more than a cynical grab for cash, cranked out to take advantage of the popular video game series. The only people who hesitate to speak the truth about this piece of trash are teenage game junkies too cool to admit that they have been taken to the cleaners by the movie industry."
1,THE HORROR,The main reason why I saw this movie was to see the Episode 1 trailer which was worth the price of admission. However WingCommander wasn't. For 90 minutes I sat there trying to make sense of this story with such a blur. The special effects were bad and the bad guys were ridiculously pathetic looking.SO IF YOU THINK HITTING YOURSELF IN THE HEAD WITH A BIG STICK IS FUNNY THEN THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU.a no star option should be made
1,homocide by movie makers,I thought this was one of the dumbest most trite movies I have ever seen in my life. The Lildard guy has one note as an actor--the slightly stupid surfer dude who is outrageous and loveable. He has played this same character is several other movies; all they do is change his name and the scenery. The special effect were so hackneyed that I was surprised that this movie was made in the late nineties. It looked and felt like it was created in the late eighties. The plot was predictable. The baddie aliens were predictable. This movie tries to kill the science fiction movie genre. Someone should stop this writer/director before they kill again.
1,would rather watch squirrells mate,"This ""movie"" is the absolute worst ever made. It was the first time that I went to a movie, and the funniest things in the theater came from all the audience members making fun of it. Not some, but the WHOLE audience. This movie is horrible. If you are 12 years old and don't mind lame acting, stupid jokes, and don't know what a plot is, you will like this movie. In fact, they might hire you to write the sequel..."
1,Terrible a poor attempt at the science fiction genre,"This was one of the worst movies i have ever scene.It was poorly put together,badly acted with a script weaker than that of an episode of teletubbies. After such an excellent trailer an exceptional film was expected,however the trailer was the Best bits of the film. I do not advise anyone to watch this."
1,I broke my nose trying not to see Wing Commander,"Bad movies come and bad movies go, but this movie redefined the phrase ""bad movie"". Wing Commander sets a new standard from which all future bad movies will be measured against. I propose a (Wing Commader)WC bad movie rating scale. A ""WC 50"" means just as bad as Wing Commander. A WC 1-49 rates it worse than Wing Commander, with a WC 51-100 being a bad movie but better than Wing Commander. A WC-100 rating would be a movie on par with The Island of Dr. Moreau, or Disney's Cinderella, or The Best of Veggetales"
1,A waste of my time and money...,"There are no two ways about it. This movie is just bad. And I didn't go into it expecting Shakespeare either. In fact, I went in with very low expectations. I often go see Sci-fi movies in the theater to get the S/FX on the big screen and more often than not end up turning my mind off and enjoying the eye candy. But there was something about this movie that just bored me to tears. The only good thing about it is that Jürgen Prochnow (Das Boot) and David Suchet (Poirot from Mystery) are in it. In fact the whole movie is Das Boot in space only... bad..."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it","It's easy to tell why this movie didn't last long in the theatres. You can't really blame it on the acting, as the script gives them little to work with. The special effects aren't fully realized and the film doesn't even make good use of of the 5.1 channels of Dolby Digital sound available to it (which can often make an average theatrical performer into a good home theatre flick).Readers of the Windg Commander novels are likely to be disappointed with the story line, and players of the Origen games would probably like to see more (and better) special effects. The included movie trailer and two TV commercials actually cover most of the best effects in the film.Buy it if you're a hard core Science fiction flick fan (or a teenage girl in love with Freddie Prinz, Jr.) But it is more of a watch it once and toss it back on the shelve, kind of product."
1,"In space, no one can hear the [crud] this movie generates...","Oh Freddy. What's next for your painfully suffering career? You're a painfully awful actor with somewhat good looks but no talent, and you have a horrible knack for making Matthew Lillard look bad. This time, you've gone too far. Not only does Lillard look bad, but legends Tcheky Karyo, Jurgen Prochnow, and David Warner simply flutter useless on the screen in what is supposed to be a submarine flick but was accidentally written in space. Chris Roberts, director of this shlock and creator of the video game, puts little enthusiasm into the movie and it's very plain the actors were doing this film for a paycheck. The action doesn't go over too well and the dialogue is worse than ""Armageddon."" The tagline for ""Alien"" says that in space, no one can hear you scream. By the end of this film, I wanted to scream."
1,Stay Away!,"One of the worst movies I've seen in my 30-odd years. If you took STAR WARS, mixed it with STAR TREK, took out all the good parts and had a 12 year old video-game addict that thinks swearing is ""cool"" to write the script you'd probably still be able to put together a movie that is better than WING COMMANDER. Avoid at all costs."
4,A FUN FILM WITH AWESOME F/X BUT LAME SCRIPT,WING COMMANDER IS A GOOD FILM OVERALL I LOVED THE CONCEPT A MOVIE BASED ON THE GAME I'M LIKE WOW THIS MOVIE WILL BE SWEET RIGHT? WRONG AND RIGHT FIRST OF ALL THE CAST IN IT WAS GOOD BUT IF I WERE IN CHARGE OF CASTING I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN MARK HAMILL TO BE IN IT. BUT WHAT WAS COOL WAS THE DIGITAL EFFECTS AND THE WWII AERIAL STUNTS. BUT WHEN IT COME STO THE STORY IT'S LAME THE CHARACTERS SHOULD AND COULD HAVE BETTER DEVELOPED AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE INTRUIGING IDEAS AND PLOT TWISTS. BUT WHAT SAVED THIS MOVIE IS THE SCORE FROM DAVID ARNOLD AND KEVIN KINER WHICH WAS EXCELLENT THE MUSIC SAVED THE MOVIE FROM BEING A WASTE. BUT KUDOS TO THE F/X AND MUSIC. BUT ONE QUESTION REMAINS WHERE DID CHRIS ROBERTS GO WORNG? I GUESS WE WILL NEVER KNOW.
1,"So Bad, I have erased it from my mind","I find most movies tolerable, and once I have seen the beginning, I almost NEVER turn one off. (I jsut have to see how it ends.) This movie was the exception. I sat through this entire movie in the movie theater, (an empty movie theater at that) and I have no idea what it was about. There was no plot to speak of, and basically the entire thing stunk! I would've walked out, except that my boyfriend insisted that we stay just in case the new star wars trailer was at the end. I am writing this review to try to save someone the disappointment, and loss of money and tiem, of seeing this movie."
1,Maybe a bit less painfull than a root canal,"But probably not. I am an avid fan of both Sci-fi movies and war movies. This is easily the worst example of either.There are sever problems dealing with the science of the movie, which is distracting. There is not a single performance by any actor in this movie which does not look like they are being forced to make the movie at gun-point.I can respect Roberts for trying to make the movie different from the games. Also, I can respect that he wanted the feel of a WWII drama. What I can't respect is a script which seemed to be written by a student in remedial high school English, and performances which seemed to be some kind of therapy for severe personality disorders."
1,Perhaps one of the worst movies of all time,"Not only did this movie lack a plot and depth, but was further more boring and long. I went to see this movies in the theaters only to leave half way though crying from laughter at how simply awful it was. I am not a particular gamer buff or sci-fi fanatic but in going to see this movie I was expecting some special effects. You know a spaceship battle or two some aliens, maybe a explosion or two, instead what I got was a plot that was next to random, a handful of characters that were dislikable, and some cheezy love story."
2,"EXCELLENT PICTURE AND SOUND, BUT LACKS PLOT AND CHARACTERS","This DVD depicts a fictional battle for the earth between the ""Confederation"" and the ""Kilrabi"" (Think the Federation and the Klingons). The movie is visually stunning with excellent definition and color saturation. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack is of reference quality and one of the best I have heard on DVD. Unfortunately, the plot is very poorly developed and the movie is populated by people who you care absolutely nothing about. The story is almost non-existent. This is a disc you rent to enjoy for its wonderful soundtrack which really defines the benefits of 5.1 digital sound, but after having seen it once you don't need to own it."
1,"They can keep the money, I just want my two hours back.","This is a bad movie. Plain and simple. The plot is barely existent, and the acting is either bad or melodramatic. So remember: don't buy this movie, don't rent this movie and don't even look at the picture of the movie."
4,A GUILTY PLEASURE,THIS MOVIE IS MY GUILTY PLEASURE I SAY THAT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT AND THE SCRIPT AND STORYLINE ARE _BAD__ AND THE PERFORMANCES WERE OK AT BEST BUT NONE THE LESS I LOVED IT MAINLY BECAUSE OF ITS RELENTLESS ACTION SEQUENCES AND ALSO THE VISUAL STYLE WHICH WHICH WAS THE BEST THING ABOUT THE MOVIE BESIDES THE F/X. BUT THE STORY WAS BAD IT HAD NO TWISTS OR ANYTHING IT WAS STANDARD ISSUE NO NOTHING AND THE CAST WAS OK. BUT ONE THING THAT SAVE THIS MOVIE FROM BEING BAD WAS THE MUSIC FROM DAVID ARNOLD AND KEVIN KINER IT WAS LOUD LIKEABLE AND A HOLE LOTTA OTHER THINGS. IF YOU DON'T MIND A BAD SCRIPT AND STORYLINE BUT LIKE ACTION AND COOL F/X THEN THIS IS YOUR MOVIE. LET'S HOPE IS CHRIS ROBERTS DECIDES TO MAKE ANOTHER WING COMMANDER MOVIE IT HAS A BIGGER BUDGET AND A BETTER STORYLINE AND MORE ACTION.
5,Excellent!Outstanding!Wing Commander is brilliant!,"Wing Commander is a masterpiece. The movie has an intriging plot with amazing special effects. The only problem I have with it is that the Kilrathi look a little funny. No matter, a must-see."
3,"A bit of a disappointment, but it could have been worse.","Actually this movie is not as bad as some people make it out to be. Being a fan of the Wing Commander games I had expected something better, but when I look back on it I admit my first critisisms were a little too hard. Wingcommander has splendid special effects and the fact that the fighters look like a WWI pilots nightmare actually adds to the sense of the futuristic. At least I did not have the idea, that I would have been able to design these planes myself. The acting left a lot to be desired and the plot could have been better but Wing Commander was quite entertaining. The one real objection I have is the use of sonar in outer space. Everybody is talking in wispers for fear of being detected, as though soundwaves can travel through a vacuum!"
3,Divided...,"Well, I played the game and I liked it very much - for some time at least - mostly due to the cinematic sequences and the action. The movie, yes it's bad but for the gamer it is somehow worth to see it. The Animations are quite nice and go much further than in the game. Definetly NO movie for the usual SciFi fan or movie viewer. For the one who knows the game, I would say it's nice to watch."
1,How I wasted 90 minutes of my life,"Why did I watch this movie through to the end? Well I bought and played the first 3 wing commander games and enjoyed them immensely. I felt I owed the memory of those games a full viewing, I was wrong. Apart from some occasional good special effects the story line was crass and the acting was dubious. The Kilrathi hardly featured and when they did they looked like something out of a bad 50's b-movie. They are supposed to be heartless, warrior cat like beings, but are about as scary as miss piggy.Blair is half pilgrim on his mothers side. People generally don't like or trust pilgrims and bad mouth him and his father because of it. He is a rapier pilot and must be reasonably intelligent, and yet it took Paladin, another pilgrim, to tell him the most basic historic facts as to what a pilgrim actually is. I know the audience needs to be informed, but come on.....Amazon only go as low as one star so I had to up my rating!"
5,Loved it!,"Personally, I've never played the video game, (although I do love video games), and I thought the movie was great! Of course, what movie with Matthew Lillard ISN'T great...hehehe....Nah, really, it's definetly action-packed, the story line isn't TOO complicated (hey, if I can get it, YOU can get it! ), and there's a great cast, even minus Matthew Lillard! Give it a try, if you're like me, you wont be disappointed! Oh yeah, and to all you people who gave the movie bad reviews, *sticks tongue out at them*"
3,Disappointed in music quality..,"At the price, you can't expect a TON, but I was still pretty disappointed in this system, compared to its competitors. As far as music went, the sound came across as very flat and 'empty'. Its very reliant on the subwoofer to make alot of noise, but its not good noise. No rich, vibrant tones could be had, even after playing around with EQ settings. It definitely makes noise though - this would be best applied for the budget gamer or regular user.. not particularly adapted for someone who uses their PC as a jukebox, however. The subwoofer is very strong for its size."
1,Toxic Energy,"Beware......I would'nt take these, read below link and research before thinking you are taking something benefical. All research here showing negative effects on the human body.[...]"
2,Though this was a regular tube,"It was some funky presta valve tube. Had no idea what that meant,now I do!"
3,Used one season,I used these tubes for most of one season of mountain biking. The biggest threat to tires I have is thorns. The tubes seem to work for small punctures but a large thorn would do them in. They did save me changing tubes on two or three rides during the season. I went through 4 slimed tubes and 6 regular tubes during the season. I ran the slimed tubes about two thirds of the time. I ride about once a week. I would suggest buying some non-slimed extra thick tubes and carry a couple spares. Trick: When a slimed tube is punctured put about 10 pounds of pressure in the tube and turn the tube so the puncture is at the point closest to the ground in a few minutes the puncture is sealed and the tube can be pumped back up. If the puncture is too big the seal will blow out.
5,Woth it,"I was riding around one evening, a little off-road, and went over a field of grass. When I was back on the road, I had a tyre with more than 20 burrs in it. I picked them out, one by one. Fortunately, as I had the slime tube, following the pump up, sure enough each of the minor punctures was repaired, and I was able to ride home. I still use the same tube (I haven't needed to replace it yet...)"
1,slimey mess,"Slime in tubes is like eating fast food. It sometimes does the trick, it sometimes makes you sick. As a professional bike mechanic, I have pulled thorns out of tubes with slime and it sometimes holds the air and sometimes a small green puddle hisses at you, almost making fun of you for filling your ties with something that looks like antifreeze and has the consistency of snot. There are more effective and lightweight latex tire fillers commonly used on tubeless tires that I have pulled countless thorns out of with no leakage, but to me the best possible fix are Rema patches. Never once, when properly applied, have I had one of those fail."
2,No Real Difference,"I've used about four of these things and haven't noticed an appreciable difference between a good regular tube. I have had two blow immediately (one within a couple of days and yesterday after five hours). When the second one blew it left a large amount of bright green slime all inside my tire and over the inside of the rim. Real fun to clean off on a long ride. Won't be purchasing these again, feel it's mostly hype."
1,DO NOT BUY IT. I received something different.,"I'm not sure if it was just a mistake of an emplyoee, but I received a bike tube in a white box. There was no brand name and explanation; just a tube in a while box. I just did not return the item because I was just lazy. So, I warn you that you might receive something you did not expect."
3,Ok,"I rode on this for about two weeks and after numerous goatheads (I live in Phx, AZ and the roads and offroad are littered with them) the tube became unrepairable. I keep using them cause I haven't found anything else on the market that is tougher. They are not very heavy for a slime filled tube, which is good."
1,useless goop,"Many a time have I pulled out the tube to find green liquid hissing from pinholes far smaller than 1/8th inch, leaving nothing but a Slime-y mess. Don't bother."
2,It's Supposed To Do What ???,"Heavy, relatively expensive and messy when it splits open - I don't know there's any argument here.But that's OK - if it really prevents a flat. I don't know, I'm staring at one now after biking through thorns last week. Apparently a slow leak that's gone flat over a week. But, isn't that what the slime tube was supposed to prevent? I guess the argument is it could have gone flat on the mountain. Kinda like the absence of something happening is the value statement for why you should believe in something that appears to accomplish nothing good. A faith-based belief in Slime.I've used them on my MTBs for a long time, but I'm done with their products."
1,doesn't really work,"I have not had much luck with these tubes actually performing as they say. They don't really seal small punctures like a mesquite thorn or cactus. I've had way too many times where I have come out and found the tire down, green slime running out on the floor and all there was was a very small puncture. I've finally switched to Stans No Tubes."
1,False sense of security,ve been stranded twice by these tires. Sure it can fix some flats but if you get a pinch flat (common in the rockies) it doesn't work. Worst of all the slime makes it so you can't patch the tire effectively (no matter how carefully you clean).Avoid the gimmick and just use your $1 patch kit and don't be stranded.
2,"Heavy, Sealent Yet to be Proven","The first thing you will notice is how heavy these tubes are next to a standard tube, but that is to be expected for the most part. If you are concerned about weight, stay away from these. When filling or checking pressure, the valve must be rotated to the top or you'll shoot slime out of valve and in your pump (it is easy to forget this).So far, I used the tube for about 100 miles of very rocky single track MTB with no problems, even aired down to 25 PSI. All the cons noted above are worth putting up with if it prevents even one flat. I have yet to prove the self-healing feature, but I am confident it will work.UPDATE 8/12/12 - the tube was punctured and the slime did not work. I will not purchase one of these again."
4,Kenny and Dolly In Their Prime,"I have this basic performance on VHS tape, and wanted to preserve it on DVD. It's an interesting and entertaining look at the interaction between these two country (and sometimes cross-over)Super Stars."
1,Boo Hiss,This is horrible. The original concert I saw on HBO was very good. This is a foreign very poor dubbing. I doubt seriously it is legal to sell it in the USA. The picture quality and the audio quality are extremely poor do not purchase this concert I sure wish I had not wasted my money on it.It certainly did not even deserve one star.
3,I liked most of the book,"I really liked most of this book and found it to be very insightful and helpful. The only section I didn't feel was useful in my situation was the exposure part of the book. I think that would be helpful for people who have particular situations that cause their panic. But my panic is more anticipatory panic that can pop up anywhere. It's not tied to leaving my house, small spaces, spiders, or anything in particular. So if you have panic tied to specific circumstances, then that chapter may be very helpful for you. All in all, I would recommend it."
5,This book is AWESOME!!!!!,"I just received this book in the mail a few days ago. I suffer from panic attacks, and well, I just can't put the book down..it is wonderful. I have not started the steps to recovery...but I will...I just wanted to say that I know this book will give me back my life."
5,Wish I would of found it sooner,"Great workbook, I wish I would of found it 12 years ago. Great exercises, makes sense. Highly recommend if you suffer from panic disorder."
5,Excellent Workbook,"Based on CBT, this attracted me to the book. I was not disappointed at all with the work book. I recommended it to everyone in group therapy. If you truely want to help yourself get better you need to work thru this book."
4,You've Gotta Have Heart!,"As a manager who has had to lay off employees during the recent economic downturn, I am glad I discovered this book. I applied the recommendations on dealing with employees and I feel it enabled both my staff and me to face the reality of business issues with mutual respect and understanding. I would recommend it to any level of manager."
4,Managing from the Heart,"Once upon a time, in the early '90s, a quartet of Atlanta organizational consultants - Hyler Bracey, Jack Rosenblum, Aubrey Sanford and Roy Trueblood - wrote this business management parable about a manager who grows from sour and crusty to sweet and caring. Their book caught the corporate world's imagination and gave life to a ""kinder, gentler"" management style. Today, as authoritarian management tactics continue to fade and collaborative, empathetic leadership proves increasingly productive, their five axioms merit revisiting. These principles call for being understanding, supportive, perceptive, honest and compassionate. The story may be a bit schmaltzy, and it draws to a predictable conclusion; yet, because it departs from typical leadership tales and because it has hardily weathered the test of time, getAbstract recommends it to managers who want to succeed as leaders by being both effective and empathetic."
2,A so-so message delivered in a gooey-sweet wrapper,"The basic principles this book tries to teach are, although obvious, certainly well-meaning, harmless, and probably practical enough if applied sensibly.However, the gooey-sweet fluffy medium used to deliver the message makes it very hard to take seriously. In a corporate fairy-tale approach, the protagonist, a big, bad ""abominable no-man"" manager, suffers a near-death experience and is subsequently guided by an angel through his transformation into a manager with heart.Please. If this is intended for real corporate managers and executives, why tell bad fairy stories? It makes the overall message much less appealing and far less likely to be taken seriously!I gave it two stars, instead of one or none, because the underlying concepts do have *some* merit. However, this one really isn't worth your time or money."
4,"A well-organized, logical, pocketable guide.","I travel alot both for business and pleasure. I usually buy four to six guides per trip but the guide that I relied on for my trip to Madrid last month made my trip very, very enjoyable. The new Knopf City Guides are nicely organized and color coded to meet the travelers most sought after needs. Where to stay, eat, shop, see sights, enjoy night life are cross referenced and expertly mapped. Not only do they stick to their view of the highlights but each of the sections make it easy to find other attractions outside the section of interest. For instance, the micro map views in the shopping section also contained numbered,colored references to the after hours and eating sections. I would highly recommend these guides to anyone visiting the cities covered."
2,I DON'T LIKE KNOPF CITY GUIDES,"Don't confuse the Knopf city guide with the Knopf Guide. The Knopf Guides are quite good. The city guide, of which I have mistakenly bought several, is very short, and devotes at least 80% to where to eat, where to stay, where to shop, where to find night life...20% or less useful info of what to visit if your'e a tourist. And the maps are pretty useless too."
1,Bench Mark Oregon,"Sorry; but I am unable to give a review of this product. I keep getting a confirmation that I should have received the product, but my account was credited for the full amount, and the due date is past. I take it that it was out of stock; but there was never any confirmation directly telling me such. I reorderd another map book and will review it if I receive it. Otherwise I thank you; b;ut I feel you could be more informative other than just giving me my refund.-----Merle Simmons"
3,wannab,"Please don't by this DVD! I'm only giving it 3 stars because I love Laird Hamilton... It was such a let down after watching Riding Giants, now THAT was a great movie, Truly inspirational!! It's just not worth the money. Sorry Laird...."
3,Fewer Puzzles,"I love these books. I got the subscription on the kappapuzzles.com website, not Amazon. I did not have any trouble with my subscription through them directly. When I first started getting my books, there were 80 puzzles in each book. Not too long ago, I received a book with 65 puzzles. I contacted Kappa Puzzles about it. They said all the other books will have 65 puzzles in it. And, they did NOT lower the price. So you are now getting 15 less puzzles in your book while paying the price for 80 puzzles. I was NOT very happy with them and they never really gave me an answer on why they did it. They were actually rude about it. I know why they did it and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. But they were NOT going to admit to it."
1,Still waiting,Can't really review this because it still has NOT arrived. It is now April. I ordered this the first of February. I have heard that buying a subscription like this can be VERY risky. Well dollars down the drain. Just who do you complain to in a case like this?
4,review title,Sean Simmonds has a beautiful voice that you can enjoy while cleaning up the house or driving in your car.
1,Another bad one from Al Adamson,"Al Adamson made some truly awful movies (Blood of Ghastly Horror) and some that provides decent entertainment (Brain of Blood, Blood of Dracula's Castle). ""Nurse Sherri"" falls somewhere in between but closer to the awful section. It starts out about some cult and after that it's about some nurse that gets possessed by a demon and starts killing patients. Like several other Adamson movies, I guess this must be one of those movies that were patched together using pieces of other unfinished movies. It is not worth spending money on nor spending the time to watch."
3,Adequate for the home kitchen,"Were it not for the plastic coupling which attaches the grinding unit to the metal motor housing, I would give this item 4+ stars, but it is certain that this screw coupling, which must be used each time the grinder is washed, will fail before any other part of the grinder.Everything else is satisfactory and it does a good job of grinding at 3 different degrees from course to very fine. The motor is more than powerful enough and makes easy work of very tough cuts. The sausage-stuffing tube works as advertised and is a good plus."
2,Wish it lasted,"I have this grinder for about a year. It worked great, but the tube u stuff meat through was a little small. I ground whole chikens for my cats, and it went ok til today. I put a leg through it and i heard a crunch and the shaft stopped turning. I opened thecasing up and the gears come to find out are plastic, so needless to say this is the weakest link. So other than the fact that it just broke on me it was an ok grinder for meat only!!!"
5,Suede with some of their best songs,"Oh, they are just so great. The first ""My insatible one"" is terrific. You can hear that they are in there finest shape, and are now takig some of there best ""unknown"" songs and making them to something ordinary. A frech side of the best band in the world."
4,IN AND OF ITSELF MORE THAN A COMPILATION,"Fluid and dreamy but not without a pop beat sensibility, England's 'Suede' sails a romantic ferry across the Mersy with inspirations of Smiths, Bowie and Ray Davies along as passengers in this 27 track double CD compilation. Brett Anderson has a personable, emotional singing style and although the lyrics lack much depth his tidy and refined songs are heart-felt and often striking in a folk-goth-rock minstrel way. Guitarist Richard Oakes lays down some flashy superb rock tracks without causing much corrosion to the pretty tapestry."
3,a mixed bag,"sci-fin lullabies sums up everything that is potentially invigorating, as well as everything that is irksome about suede. the first disc (for the main part recorded with bernard butler) is sheer perfection; flawless songs, and a cohesion that would suggest that this is in fact a complete album, not merely a compilation of b-sides. the second disc however proves that sude, in the wake of the departure of butler and his succession by richard oakes, managed to pen 10 excellent songs for the coming up album, but frankly, not much more than that. the b-sides acoompanying the singles off that album were cluttered with mediocre songs, irrelevant dub jams, and whatsnot. in effect, sci fi lullabies as a whole declines song by song. the final result then comes to this: 5 stars for the first disc, 2 for the second. an average of 3 is what remains."
5,GREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!,"This is definitely one of the best CDs I've ever heard. These songs are B-sides, but way more than ""just"" B-sides! This is a band that still lives with it music, instead of just trying to make money with it. These are real emotions!"
5,the most passioned artistry ever!,"quite simply an utter delight . Following on from coming up ( not as good as the real uncommercial suede) this compilation of B-sides shows the true remarkable romantic passion that Brett and the boys can master . This album will ( for those who can empathise ) take you through love , lust , coming up and coming down ,excitement , confusion ...the list of tempers , passions and frustrations is endless....the sheer genius and fairy tale romanticism is unique ! Suede, what an achievement ((( and it feels pretty good when you work out how to play the songs on the albvum as well )))"
5,Suede's best songs,"Dollar-for-dollar, this compilation is a better deal than any of Suede's albums. In some cases, these b-sides are quite a bit stronger than the a-sides they were originally packaged with.The first side is the stronger of the two, with 'To The Birds,' 'High Rising,' 'My Dark Star,' 'Killing of a Flash Boy,' 'Together' and especially 'Europe is our Playground' brushing the sublime. 'But that's almost all the songs on the side,' you might say. Well, yeah.The second side is Suede in their later phase, their grittier, less artistic phase, and while I don't think it led to a decline in the quality of their albums, I do think the b-sides suffered. Still, 'Every Monday Morning,' 'Money' and 'Sadie' are excellent.This is just Suede's best music, simply. A must-have for any collection, and especially for the fan."
5,A cut above,"For me, this collection of B-sides proved why Suede were a cut above the plethora of British indie artists who trod the path Suede had beaten in the mid nineties.They produced these quite beautiful and moving songs, that without this compilation would have been forgotten; almost thrown away to accompany singles that didn't exactly sell profusely.What a tragedy that would have been. Generations never having the chance to hear the heart-wrenching melancholy of The Living Dead, the sadness of The Big Time or the swagger and menace of Killing of a Flashboy.The majority of the songs here deserved to be singles in their own right. A quite staggering achievement."
2,Historical not instructive,I wanted more of a how to not historical perspective.It doesHistorical well so if that's what you want it is ok
4,Usual Great Standard from Lonely Planet,"I mainly use Lonely Planet for sites to see, city walking tours and information on the history. I use Trip Advisor now for accomodation and I think Lonely Planet needs to catch up, as people can research so much now on the internet so their several pages of accommodation are getting pretty close to redundant, they need to scale this back and increase information on interests in the respective city. This feedback is general across the Lonely Planet range and not aimed at the Belgium/Luxembourg book. The information given is easy to follow, but I did find myself flipping pages to read the special box text information a lot.."
5,Inspiring & Useful,This book is full of inspiring quotes from Catholic saints throughout the ages. I found it useful for church bulletins and other publications.
5,Yummy Healthy Crunchy Delight,"These really are good. A lot of protien bars have a funky taste, not this one. I love to tuck one into my purse just in case I need a hit of protien. I highly recommend this for folks on the run. The flavor and texture is fantastic! Sincerely, Becky"
2,Only skims the surface,"While this is a pleasant viewing experience, it really aims low in terms of content. Charlie Moore isn't mentioned until game five of the ALCS. Mike Caldwell isn't mentioned until game one of the World Series! Pitchers such as Jim Slaton, Randy Lerch, Jamie Easterly and Chuck Porter aren't mentioned at all, as if Vuckovich and Fingers were the only contributors to the pitching staff. Don Money, Ned Yost, Marshall Edwards - they don't even exist! Key games are overlooked, such as the game at Fenway with Ned Yost's winning home run. And even the playoff coverage is weak. We see almost nothing of game 4 of either the ALCS or the World Series. And they overlook Marshall Edwards' catch in game five of the ALCS. Very weak. Why not include three hours of material on a DVD? Renting this is fine (try Netflix), but don't shell out the cash."
1,MORE CONJECTURE THAN SUBSTANCE,"THE AUTHOR SPENDS THE BALANCE OF THIS BOOK GIVING HIS OPINIONS CONCERNING COVER-UPS AND CONSPIRACIES THAN THE ACTUAL SUBJECT OF STRATEGIC RELOCATION. THE HIGH POINTS OF THE BOOK WERE THE NUMEROUS GRAPHS COMPARING DEMOGRAPHICS OF VARIOUS SUBJECTS INCLUDING POPULATION, WEATHER, POLLUTION AND MILITARY TARGETS...THESE WERE VERY INTERESTING AND HELPFUL. IF THE AUTHOR HAD STICKED TO THESE AND INCLUDED MORE DETAIL ON A REGIONAL BASIS THE BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE USEFUL. MOST OF THE BOOK GOES INTO NEW WORLD ORDER TYPE CONSPIRACY INFOMATION. ALL IN ALL, I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED. I GIVE THIS BOOK A BIG ""NO GO""."
1,The COMMIES are coming. The COMMIES are coming !!!!,"Well, I don't need a 1000 words, really just a few. If you like boring FICTION read this book. How about a -5 stars for a rating ?"
2,Physical defect.,"The book was written well enough, at least what I dared read of it. But the problem was that the binding would break loose the pages as you turned them. The adhesive in the binding was brittle, and the pages would come out as you read the book. Had to stop until I had a solution."
3,King of all typos,"I loved the concept of this book but the execution was poor.As mentioned in reviews the typos were ever present. Some simple things like city names were incorrect, example (New Braunfels TX was listed as ""New Brainless TX"")It might have been a subconscious jab at the city but I had to double-take a few times at the typos. I guess the editor took the month off.Once I was past the little things the book had interesting content. I loved the crime and ethnicity tables. I learned a bit about obscure parts of the country I would not have unless I went there myself.Great concept but execution needs some improvement.Religious and possibly Libertarian undertones but facts were delivered well.Do not spend too much for this book!"
2,"Beaverton, OR???","I can only guess that Beaverton Oregon was chosen solely on some census data? Joel, there is nothing strategic or safe about Beaverton...I live here!!! Basically a ugly suburb of Portland that will be burned to the ground once social unrest takes over."
2,Low Quality Presentation,"While the information contained in this book is important, I found the poor English and grammatical errors to be unacceptable. Also, the accompanying maps are exceedingly poor in quality (very difficult to read). I had hoped for so much more. I'll think twice before purchasing another book from Mr. Skousen. I certainly won't pay full price."
1,Total waste of time. Complete failure as a product.,"I would give this zero stars if possible. I'll just cut to the chase, THESE DO NOT WORK! Don't waste your money. After patching a tiny puncture the patch failed immediately after applying only 30 lbs to the remounted tire. Removed tire and re-patched using another Skab. The exact same thing occurred. Failure of the patch. These may be cheap and light but they suck at what they are supposed to do, patch an inner tube. I'll probably avoid any Slime brand products from now on."
1,Scab repairs leak air,"I've got a couple of these scab on a couple of tubes and I see that most leak. At first they work, but they don't seem to handle inflation and deflation very well, they don't stretch with the tube.All the other types of patches I've ever used worked.Not worth the trouble."
2,simply doesn't work,"I had a small punture that was about 1/3 cm wide. I followed the instructions and used the patch after I roughened up the area. It looked like it was sealed properly, but within 12 hours the tire was flat again. I tried it again and this time I gave it a day to stick before I inflated the tire. It worked a little better, but still got flat. The only reason why I gave this product 2 stars is because the tire levers included makes it a whole lot easier to remove and replace the tire."
1,Doesn't Work,Tried to use yesterday on a bike ride. Tiny hole. Would not hold air after 25 pounds. Don't buy. Lucky I had spare tube with me.
1,Doesn't work!,"Tried this to patch a road bike tire, and it didn't work. Tried using glue with it and it still didn't work. It does hold a little pressure for a little while so it might work in an emergency to get you home, but if I take the trouble to pull the tube out of the tire I want to use a patch that will actually work!"
1,Does not work,"Absolutely terrible, leaked right away, i tried repatching it 3 times. The hole was not that big, the last time i tried using 4 at once all overlapping, did not help."
2,PFFFsst! about half the time.,"These work about half the time, which is no fun on the road. The rubber cement style patches work better, but take longer. Use the Park Tool patches. They are far better."
1,They don't work,"I bought a pack of these once, and it was one of the worst purchases of my life. In short, after applying an entire pack of the things to the same leak the tube still would not hold enough air for me to move more than a few meters and I wound up walking 8 miles with loaded panniers--not an experience I'd recommend. Go with a proper vulcanizing patch set. The time you save in applying these you'll lose many fold in repeated attempts to patch the same leak before finally giving up and walking."
1,Small puncture unfixable,"Used as instructed and could not even get back home, had to push bike for 2 miles in the middle of the night. Not fun at all, got home and used some old patches with proper liquid vulcanizer and presto, fixed.Do not ever purchase any type of bike flat repair kit that does not include liquid vulcanizer, there is simply no way to get around using it for a proper fix."
1,Skabs-The Name Says It All,"Like a scab you would get on your arm or knee, these ""patches"" are likely to leak when the tube swells with air pressure just as a scab would crack and bleed when you bend your arm or knee. They are good enough for a temporary fix to get you out of the woods, but no further. Not one patch I used (and I used them all) held air for more than ten minutes. Absolutely not worth it, unless for the tire levers."
1,How quickly we fail...,"I was initially enthusiastic about these ""scabs"". I followed the instructions carefully but in two repairs, both failed. Don't let these strand you somewhere--they may seem to be working at first. It took 2 weeks for my repairs to prove futile. Oh well, back to the drawing board!"
2,Patches have never held,I've used 3 of the patches and they have never been able to maintain a seal. I would look for either a better pre-glued patch or go for the ones you have to add the glue.
3,not bad,"These are ok. When i got them i put on my deflated bike tire, but the next day it was flat again i removed the patch and placed another one in there and it is still there."
1,Does not work!!!!,"OK,Used these patches on two seperate scooter tires. Followed directions and the patch seemed to stick perfectly. As soon as air pressure was applied the patch let go, and this happen twice!!!! Also tried using one on my son's little duck bathtub, the next day the duck was dead. Horrible product. Stick with the old glue and rubber patch, you can't beat it."
5,More than worth it,"This cd is absolutely fabulous. I have listened to it a million times and I still love it. Celine is on her best when she can song love songs and she gets to your heart. When I hear her song love songs, I get goosebumps. And not a lot of singers are doing that to me. She really has the greatest voice on this planet and makes me wonder how she does it. Simply the best."
3,"Nice, but poor sound quality","I liked the CD and songs on it, but the only problem was that the quality of the sound was poor, regardless of the kind of system i used in playing it. It didnt sound so well in my car nor at home."
1,Cat in Heat,"""My Heart Will Go On"" is an exceptionally beautiful song, and showed great promise. Unfortunately it is the only good song on the CD. My advice to Celine: stop trying to imitate Barbara Streisand's voice and style, and imitate instead her talent for understanding what is special about her own voice. You can do better than this!"
1,This stuff makes my teeth ache.,"How sad the state of popular music is that this shrill, shrieking vocalist can make it to the top of the charts. Celine may think so, but she's no Streisand. She's no diva at all. She's an overrated, mediocre talent who has already over stayed her welcome. Go away Celine, and please, please, please, take Mariah Carey with you!"
1,She has no talent!,"I loved Celine's Falling into You, but now I find her annoying, pretentious, verbearing, and nauseating. What a ditz! Titanic is the stupidest, worst CD and will someone tell Celine to shut up? The boat sank, the guy died, get over it. I'd say where she can go stick her heart, but I'm not going to. If you want really beautiful music, listen to the Goo Goo Dolls. If you want mindless screaming and kind of scary chest banging, listen to Celine Dion. But before you, do, take a moment and think about your poor ears."
2,NOT ALL THAT!!,"I listen to this album and was unimpressed. It was filled with sickening ballads that made you just want to hurl! Don't get me wrong, i liked ""my heart will go on"" which was obviously a hit because of the movie ""titanic"". I like celine but, i was not happy with this one. Maybe next time!"
4,Yet another great album by a grand star,"Celine does it again! She gives us listeners something that'll make us look inside ourselves and realize all the love we have. The best ballads are ""My Heart Will Go On"", ""Just a Little Bit of Love"" and ""To Love You More""- one of her best ever! The tiresome ""Tell Him"" duet succumbs to the album as one of the worse sides. Yet songs like ""Where Is the Love"" and ""The Reason"" lift the fact that parts of the album are slow and have failed their duty- to entertain the listener. ""Let's Talk About Love"" closes the album nicely. If Celine wanted to end her career- this album should've been the last."
2,a super comercial album,"This album is perfect if you like Celine Dion. The songs are Love Ballads with her voice. Anyway the Highlight of the album is the duet with Barbra Streisand, who proves that she is better singer than Celine, specially in the moment when she sing ""And Whisper"" in the end of the song and we can only hear her voice. If you like Celine Dion, buy this album.(The song in Spanish is one of the worst songs that I ever heard)"
3,Music For The Spazzes,This vendor is excellent. I received the CD earlier than planned and in perfect condition. The CD itself is a separate matter. I've got nothing against Celine Dion's music. It's just not my cup of pee. I purchased this CD for a relative.
4,Let's Talk about this Great CD!,"I have always liked Celine Dion...ever since her American debut in 90 with the hit ""Love Can Move Mountains."" This is Definatly one of her best albums (Along with ""Falling into You"" which is her other best) and shouldn't be missed on any fan. As with me if you enjoyed the smash hit ""My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme from Titanic)"" then you'll like the rest of the songs, as they fit in well together...ranging from mid upbeat (Which she is Best at), to ballads. I also enjoy the single ""To Love You More."" This one is an extended version which shows off a talented violinist (Whomever he/she may be)! This song was also the theme of the movie ""The Quest For Camelot."" My Absolute fav on this album occurs at the very very end of the Album which is the Album's title song ""Let's Talk About Love."" - It's PHENOMINAL! You really have to hear it to believe it. This is one of the Best albums and If you enjoyed the singles releaed check this one out!"
2,OVERPRODUCED AND THEREFORE DISAPPOINTING,"Celine is one of my favorite singers, but on this CD she is just trying to do too much. Yes, there are a couple of gems on here, but this combination of songs doesn't gel into anything one can listen to all the way through in one go. Does she think she won't make another English recording? Also she wails her guts out on a few songs and kills them. Less is more, doll. Her work with Jean-Jacques Goldman is much better. Spend your money on S'il Suffisait D'aimer instead."
3,Mediocre,"Celine, at best, is average. Most of her singing comes out strainful! She sounds okay, at times, but for the most part, she screams every living note there is! Probably thats why TIMES and other publication declared this CD as OVER BEARING, A SCREAMING FEST! I agree, sadly! With all the hoopla she has generated lately, you would think she would be great! Well, what a way to be disappointed! But, its great that she hired a vocal coach to train her voice better! I heard that she lost her voice in one of her concert! how unfortunate! Thats because she screams a lot in her song! Thats why she looks strained when she sings! Well, i hope she gets better."
5,This is a very good c.d.,"This is an excellent CD. You can tell that Celine Dion puts a lot of feeling in her songs. It also has a lot of good songs, besides "" My Heart Will go On"" I would definatly recommend this CD."
4,This thing rules!,"""To Love You More"" was absolutely fabulous! I loved it from begining to end. I think all young singers should listen to it. (Unless you want to be an opra singer)"
5,Awesome album!,"Her songs have a mixture of sounds, and are beautiful to listen to, especially on a rainy day in front of the fireplace. It's very relaxing, and I would recommend this to all of her fans!"
4,"""To Love You More"" - a great song","""To Love You More"" was used as the theme song in a very sad and touching Japanese TV drama. The people who have watched the show would undoubtedly buy the CD just for this song alone."
5,I love this c-d!,"This is the best c-d I have. I love it! There's only one problem: ""I Love You Then I Hate You"" is the weirdest song I ever heard! I burst out laughing when I heard it! My favorite songs are : The Reason, Immoraltiy, Treat her Like a Lady, Tell Him, To Love You More and Let's Talk About Love. Overall this c-d is the best Celine Deon has ever done, and it's beautifully made. I'd recommend it to anyone who asked about it!"
1,Celine Dion disapoints me with this sad effort of a C.D.!,"Don't get me wrong- I am a huge fan of Celine, but this album isn't true to her taste. I enjoyed her past music, but this is very displeasing. I'm selling this one to the used C.D. store."
1,"No Streisand, no diva, just plain nauseating.","Unable to deal with the horrifying possibility of accidentally hearing another cd as bad as this one, I have just finished tearing my ears out with my bare hands."
4,Let's Talk,"Package arrived in good time and good condition. Album was, as I thought it would be. Cost was within the range I thought it should be."
5,"If You're Looking For Easy Listening, Positive Music, Then You're Looking For Celine","Celine Dion has been one of my most cherished musical artists. These days, it's hard to find quality music that is timeless; but Celine music is forever timeless! It's positive, it's promotes love across all relationships (love of monogamous passion, love of the common man, etc.). Celine's music comes through in her spirit and vice versa! Her music can moves your spirit whether you laugh, cry, or feel unspeakable joy! I have several Celine Dion albums. And we continue to check out others! And let's not forget about the artists behind Celine's music that complements her voice! You don't wanna pass this album up! This album's great to listen to at home, but better if you're playing it through a country road trip! Ahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Celine reminds me that my help comes from the Lord!"
1,Let's Talk About Horrible Music,"Please tell me why this woman is still alowed to make this boring, egotistical trash that passes for music. Her music is so bland and she is such a superficial artist that it makes me mad. Why do artist that are original and stay out of the spotlight get pushed asigned by a no talent hack like Ms. Dion. If I had a choice between having my arms broke or having to listen to ""My Heart will Go On"" again, lets just say my arms will always heal but the shock of listening to Dion could last a lifetime."
1,MOre sickening than a Hershey bar during a milk shortage,Celine Dion sings sickening and unrealistic love songs. All those sad ballads .
4,"Let's Talk About ""Let's Talk About Love""","This is one of Celine's best album. Collaborating with some of the biggest and best names in the music business including: her long-time idol Barbara Streisand (for their spectacular, over-the-top duet ""Tell Him""), the Bee Gees (on ""Immortality"")Carole King and Sir George Martin (who co-wrote ""The Reason"")and Lucianno Pavarotti (for their duet ""I Hate You Then I Love You""). The album was vaulted to the top of the charts back in 1998 by the ubiquitous Titanic theme ""My Heart Will Go On."" Other outstanding tracks include David Foster's gorgeous masterpiece ""To Love You More,"" the emotional title track, the powerful, poignant ""Us,"" beautiful ""Miles To Go Before I Sleep,"" and Celine's pseudo hip-hop song ""Treat Her Like A Lady,"" (featuring Diana King.) While there are a couple of weak tracks, and the aforementioned duet with Pavarotti suffers from mediocre songwriting, all in all, it is an excellent adult contemporary pop album."
4,Let's Talk About This CD,"This CD has its share of her best songs ever (Immortality, MHWGO) and quite a number of forgettable tunes. Not quite as solid as the previous three CDs, perhaps due to the inclusion of so many guest stars and so many producers. Maybe a rest period is in order."
5,Best of the Best,"Bought it for ""My Heart Will Go On"", enjoyed all other titles, especially ""Tell Him"" and ""When I Need You""!!!!"
5,Excellent!! Her best yet,I loved the cd. I initally only bought the CD because of My heart Will Go On and then I listened to it striaght through and it blew me away. Celine's voice is it's most powerful to dateon this album. The reason shows here incredible voal pwer and range I recommend this cd to anyone. Guaranteed you will love it.
3,"A Rare, Beautiful Gift...","Celine Dion has a powerful voice. No doubt about it. She has an astonishing range, as well as the vocal flexibility - within her genre - to match any opera diva. But anyone can develop power and polish. The rare, beautiful gift that only Celine has given the world, the gift that can take your breath away, is passion. There are miraculous moments when the startling intimacy of her voice brings tears to the eyes...you cannot look for it, it finds you unexpectedly. I feel that the hodge-podge of styles represented in this album contains a great deal of material inferior to her prodigious talents, although she can sing just about anything with finesse. Part of what appeals to me in ""My Heart Will Go On,"" ""I Hate You, Then I Love You,"" and ""To Love You More,"" is the musical interest provided by the added complexity of great orchestration. I look forward to hearing more dabbling in serious music as this gifted artist continues to define h! er creative essence."
5,"Beautiful selection of music pertaining to ""love""","I purchased this CD, focused on the song from Titanic which is included. (and not wanting to buy the Titanic soundtrack) From the first listening, I fell in love with every song Dion sings on this CD. Particularly beautiful are the two duets with Pavarotti and with Streisand. The final title song on the CD is also powerful, with a chorus in the background. It's my first Dion CD purchase, but it won't be my last. This will be a wonderful concert when it tours!!"
3,Not too bad.,"This album has some great songs like ""To Love You More"", ""Tell Him"" and of course ""My Heart Will Go On"". I think Celine should stick to power ballads like these."
5,Intense repertoire performed with charisma and class,"Breathtaking chords. Swelling crescendos. Soaring melodies. THE Angelic voice. Celine Dion has come into her own and proven that she indeed has the class, persona, voice, presence, and grace to cultivate a stirring work of art. Let's Talk About Love is as close to perfection as an album can attain."
1,She couldn't sing if her life depended on it!!!,She reminds me of Milli Vanilli or a cat who just had its tonsils taken out. I like the Titanic song but the way she sang it made it sound horrible.Her lack of talent makes any other artist like the Backstreet Boys sound a hundred times better.
3,"Not as good as ""Falling into You""","When I got Celine's ""Let's talk about Love"" I was a little bit disappointed to tell you the truth. Although she brings out every possibelity of her voice, I didn't get goose-bumps like with ""It's all coming back to me now"" or ""Think Twice"". To me it seemed a little bit to commercial, but it's a nice and enjoyable album anyway. And I'm very happy to say that Celine gives me goose-bumps again on her new French album ""S'il suffisait d'aimer""."
3,What a shame that this came after Falling into You,"I heard an interview a couple of monthes ago where Celine said that this was her best work yet. Well, sorry to burst your bubble but this is not the best music you have put out. Try again. You may think that I am a Celine basher but nothing can be any further from the truth-I love her. I have seen her in concert and own every cd and book. Celine- back to the drawing board."
2,Mediocre,"For someone who has sold 50 mil. albums and has the world at her fingertips, so-to-speak, you think she could come up with more that 3 good songs (""The Reason,"" ""To Love You More,"" and ""Let's Talk About Love"") on a 15+ track album... Buy one of her French albums if you want *good* music"
5,I just love Celine Dion WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS JUST PLAIN EXTRADIONARY! IT FULLFILLS ME LIKE NO OTHER ALBUM OF HERS EVER DID! SHE IS JUST AMAZING!!! SOME OF HER SONGS, I CAN RELATE TO AND CRIED TO AND STAYED UP AT NIGHTS THINKING ABOUT AND JUST SORTING OUT MY LIFE. CELINE, IF BY CHANCE, YOU READ THIS, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU AMAZE ME AND I HOPE THAT YOU GET YOUR BABY! I AM PRAYING FOR YOU! I LOVE YOU LIKE MY FAMILY AND GOOD LUCK!"
3,A good piece of work.,"Every generation has a leading pop diva. For the ninteties, it will be Celin Dion.There are hardly two opinions that Celin is a gifted singer. Her vocal ability and range have few parallels. While she puts them to best use on this album, what also fascinates are her collaborations with some of the music industry's finest recording artists; Lucianno Pavarotti, the Bee Gees, Carole King and the inevitable Barbra Steisand. But of course, the high point of the album is Celin's contribution to the Titanic Soundtrack ""My heart will go on"", that has become more of a musical anthem of its time. Critics may think that we have had too much of this Titanic business; however, it is undeniable that the song is performed with a fair measure of skill that strikes a chord in the hearts of all of us.On the other hand, the album will hardly appeal to those who lament the demise of rock'n'roll, gentle acoustics and fair singing.. but Celin was never their cup of tea anyway..."
1,"5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars, 2 stars, 1 star, celine dion","to all of you yoyos who gave celine 5 stars for this mess, you would not know what music was if it slapped you in the face. actually, you each deserve a regular slap in the face for buying the album."
4,Typical Dion,"When I say this album is typical of Mrs. Dion I mean that as a compliment, for the most part. But, as always, music takes a distant second to her voice and the album suffers. Annoying songs like ""Tell Him"" plague an otherwise great piece. For the most part, the latter half of the album is far more enjoyable with great songs such as ""To Love You More"" ""My Heart Will Go On"" and the title track ""Let's Talk About Love."" As always, a great one for Dion fans only."
3,makes me sleepy,"#12 and #14 are really good, but i hate others. this cd makes me sleepy. do not buy this cd."
5,Celine is brilliant!,"Celine Dion is a brilliant singer and this album is one of her greatest. ""My Heart Will Go On"" isn't the only good song on this album. I also like ""Immortality"" (which was written by the Bee Gees) and ""To Love You More"" which is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard in my life. Elton John is my favorite male singer and I'd love to hear Celine and Elton perform a duet together. That would be spectacular! Overall, a very well-crafted album."
5,falling into celine,"I am a real fan of Celine. Her posters are all around my room. I have 7CD's of her. Her music makes me relax, feel even happier. She is world's angel. She is the diva of the world music. This album is great. You should buy it if you are a fan of her. CELINEEEEE!!!!! OLEYYYYY!!! BEST OF THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Let's Talk About Zzzzzz...,"First of all, I think Celine is a great singer with a very good voice ... but this album just doesn't cut it. It contains too many ""sleepy"" songs and she screeches when she hits the upper octave (i.e The Reason, Treat Her Like A Lady) and sings with all the nasal-voice she is able to muster up (i.e Immortality and probably everything else!) The reason that this CD will sell-out is because of ""My Heart Will Go On"", propelled by the movie. Celine should go listen to ""Falling Into You"" once again ... listen to the material and how she sang (skip the nasal, celine!)... and do a repeat performance of that. Bottom line is, this album puts me to sleep ..."
4,"Dirrty, A Great Song","I've always liked Christina's music, but after seeing her in concert last Saturday at the Justified/Stripped tour, I like her even more. This is a girl who can REALLY sing, and she deserves some credit for Dirrty!!! The bonus, ""I Will Be"" is a really great song as well, and well worth it to buy this cd if you are a Christina fan! I thought this cd included the video on it as well, but it doesn't...that was my only disappointment."
1,Dirrty: X-Tina's Way,"Hmm....while this may not be Aguilera's worst song, probably her best, it just isn't up to par. The song itself would recieve a five star review, but the way the poptart handles herself pushed the review all the way down. The bonus track, ""I Will Be,"" is not too bad but, it just isn't very good either. Christina has something going for herself, it is just she pushed the limits too far and will always be remembered now for ""Dirrty."" The song bombed in her native U.S.A. stalling at a very low #48, and she is now laughed at by many just for being, ""dirrty."" Take this into consideration, but if you do want to own something if hers, try ""Stripped."""
3,HAND Towel - 13 inches long and only 9 inches wide,"The color was perfect, it arrived quickly and matches the other sizes perfectly. I washed all the orange towels in my front load machine and machine dried without using fabric softner and am happy with the softness, absorbency, color retention, general appearance and minimal lint.The big problem is the hand towel is narrower than any of my other hand towels and as I always fold my towels in thirds when I hang them the narrow width makes this difficult.The Bath Sheet, Bath Towel and Bath Mat would get a higher star rating."
4,A good product,The quality is pretty good. But the actual color is much brighter than it is shown on the website.
4,A Great Buy,"I really like these towels as gifts, especially at the discounted rpice I paid. They are soft and dense and seem like they will last for a long time."
3,"Ok, but not his best","It's hard to be critical of an artist like Ortega, because his worst is better than most. I have a number of his albums, including ""Hymns and Meditations"" (great!) and ""The Shadow Of Your Wings"" (awesome!). The mix on this one is an odd collection of secular tunes and traditional hymns that doesn't flow well, maybe targeted more for the ladies. I suppose you could say there's something here for everyone."
5,Calm and Reverent,"Ortega delivers again with his smooth vocals, melon-coly tunes, and worshipful lyrics. His music has a very personal quality because much of his writing is based on his own life and travels. The instruments are appropriately chosen for each song, creating a natural front-porch-hymn-sing style that refreshes the old goodies without altering them so much that we can't sing with him. Great harmonies for listening and for those who like to add their own. Highly recommended for all musicians and worshipers."
2,A study in callowness and naivete,"Stephen L. Carter wishes to deny to other African-Americans those very advantages that allowed him to ""make it"" in the system, all the while ignoring the pervasive racism that made affirmative action necessary. Coming from someone who has spent his entire life in elite academic surroundings, one wishes that he had experienced racial hostility in an up-close and personal fashion in ""the real world"". I, for one, have grown weary of denizens of ivory towers trying to preach their myopic and ill-informed sermons to those black professionals who must make their way in the harsh, acquisitive business world. This book has no grounding in the black reality."
5,A masterpiece,"Bracelen Flood's writing is at once engaging and entertaining. Even as he approaches serious topics, he continually draws in the reader to his book. Where other biographies could have been boring, this one interests. It is a truly beautiful piece of writing, matched only by Bracelen's personality. The author is a man who comes alive when talking about his subject, and his enthusiasm is evident in every word."
4,Great reading,Very good narrative about two civil war characters. Great reading even for a non-history person
4,Remarkable Relationship,This book was a well-written account of a remarkable relationship between two ordinary men who became extraordinary as a function of circumstance. I learned a lot from this easy read. It doesn't disappoint.
3,"OK, If you haven't read any other books regarding Grant of Sherman","This book was OK if you haven't read any other books on Grant or Sherman or on their campaigns. However, if you've many of the excellent books that have been printed over the past 15 years on the campaigns of Grant and Sherman or the excellent biographies on the same individuals, this book pales in comparison. So, I would recommend getting some of the other books out there on this topic. (See my listing of these books for examples)."
1,Off-cuts should not be published.,"This very short book will disappoint all but the most blindly fanatical Burroughs fans. A series of sketches inspired by the Nourse novel of the same name, it simply repeats well-worn themes dealt with more effectively elsewhere in his work. It seems to be the collected results of an aborted attempt to write a novel or screenplay, and from these insipid, lifeless scenes it is easy to see why it was aborted. The only question is: why display the lifeless corpse to the reading public? Methinks his manager was behind this unwise decision$$$For completists only."
3,One song.,"To be perfectly honest, I only like one song from this album so far. It might take some time before It starts to grow on me. But so far, I just like ""I Love Yuh"" with Alaine. That is my favorite song on the album. The problem with the song; however, is that it is too short. It needs to be at least 30 seconds longer."
1,Worst of the murder mystery games,"I own this game (in its previous incarnation, with the floppy record, not the CD) and I can honestly say it is the worst Murder Mystery game I have played out of dozens of plays by multiple companies. The plot is uncomplicated and unfun."
2,Disappointing...,"Trusting the Code Red label; we pre-ordered this disk without knowing too much about the film. Of course; when it arrived - we eagerly popped it in - looking to find a horror comedy. What we instead received was a really poor spoof, with no gore and really no decent sight gags. Think of ""Saturday the 14th Strikes Back"" (but maybe worse).The only reason it gets 2 stars for the obscurity of the material on the disk; and the fact they attempted to make it the best product possible (though the washed-out full frame transfer leaves quite a bit to be desired; we believe it's due to the age and rarity of the print).Our advice: RENT IT (if really curious)"
1,Night of the Dribbler,"I would rate it zero stars but Amazon dont give you that option, DONT BUY IT,Slow very slow and just plain stupid!!! I see why it was never released, If you are looking for a slasher flick its not one, Its the worst attempt of a comedy that i have ever viewed. The jokes are plain stupid. Words cant describe how bad it is, It felt like ever watching this film, Code red i hope you only pressed a few hundred of thses because it should go back into the vault. You are gonna lose money putting out garbadge like this, Put out NIGHTMARES IN A DAMAGED BRAIN and DEATH WEEKEND, People want these titles, Not goofy films like this."
2,A wasted oportunity,"Semiramide is a formidable masterpiece, an extraordinary opera. So far record companies have favoured Tosca and Gioconda over this far greater opera, but well, that's another topic. This very expensive recording turned out a very sour lemon. I have no idea who decided on hiring such a young and inexperienced conductor as Ion Marin for this very complex opera, his reading of the great overture is unbelievably bad, he seems to be sight reading the score for the first time. Cheryl Studer is pale and annonymous as Semiramide, she just doesn't seem to have any ideas on the role, what a pity Lella Cuberli was not preferred. Larmore, Ramey and Loppardo are the redeeming features, too little too late perhaps. DG please notice that if this recording didn't sell well, it was all your fault, not Rossini's."
5,FAT? COPY? I THINK NOT...,Do these look fat to you?NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1DO THESE LOOK LIKE BRATZ?NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SHE SHOWS SOME SKIN?YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IS THAT HORRIBLY WRONG?NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(do you show skin?YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IS THIS DOLL PERFECT?YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,A Message for Young & Old,"As a long-time Barbie fan and collector, a career woman and a mother to a young daughter- I just thought I'd add my own comments here- for the young girls, instead of complaining about who 'rules' and who 'drools' as someone so eloquently wrote, just go play with your dolls - before long you'll be older like us moms and not have much time for dolls. To the moms- this is just a toy, if you don't like it, don't buy it, but don't condemn others for doing so or dare to make a judgement about the people who do. And never judge a book by it's cover."
5,To that retard Anna Marie 'what'ever girl...,"quit being racial. This doll rocks, and no one is gonna pull her off the shelf."
5,BEAUTIFUL!,"This doll is beatful. She is not dressed like a skank and is NOT A HOE! I think the outfit isn't too slutty, I mean its not something you would want to wear in a club, (maybe some jeans instead) it could turn ugly. But to a fancy party, not formal party, it would be cool. Overall the doll is gorgeous! Buy this, its pretty!"
1,what is Mattel thinking?,doesn't anybody else think her shirt looks like a bathing suit top.they look like ( prostitutes ) in this and i wonder what mattel is thinking of next.she is barely covered up.
1,This doll is awful...,"I usually love My Scene,but this is just pathetic. These dolls are so skimpy and ugly,something I would usually NEVER call My Scene dolls. These dolls don't have any clothes on,and lots of makeup. I'm sorry,but this must be said."
1,Oh My God,"She's a slut. I don't feel like getting in detail, but chelsea was retarded before, and now she and her friends are sluts. The top part of her second outfit is freakin see-through! Mattel has to be joking."
1,Why Don't You Just Taker Their Clothes Off?,"They look slutty enough in those promiscuis clothes that show everything but. It wouldn't make a difference if you just took their clothes all off. If you buy these toys for your children, don't be surprised if you wake up in the morning to find them with piles of makeup on, bling, and tight clothes.REALITY CHECK!And this is from a thirteen year old who lived through the times before Bratz came along (and what an obnoxious name)."

1,Ow! My eyes burn. Call the hospital.,This is so gross. I don't know why mattell thinks kids staring at Chelsea's b00bs is fun. This doll should be for kids 13 and older.
1,HAH! HAH!,"Wow. this is the stupidest f***ing toy ever. she looks like a slut. her clothes are sick and too small, and what is with the name? bling? that is SO gay. its so funny to see people sticking up for this piece of s*** doll."
1,"uhhh, yeah","Does this review have ANY cuss words in it??? I dont think so...This doll is VERY innapropiate. I have NO idea what your talking about. This doll is VERY ugly. BRatz NEVER wear clothes like THAT! THey wear pants and when they DO wear skirts, they dont go above their freakin butt.-zoe"

IF SHE DID, THEN SHE WOULD BE WITH THOSE SISSY STUPID MY SCENE LOVERS. WAZ UP WITH THE BELLY BUTTON RING????? WHEN BRATZ HAD A BELLY BUTTON RING, ALL OF YOU MY SENE OBSESSED PEEPS WERE LIKE, ""OMG!!!

4,My daughter loves the doll,"Barbie and Bratz are not my preferred type of doll, but my daughter loved the doll, its clothes and accessories."
4,I LOVE THIS DOLL SOOO MUCH!,"Ihate when people say My Scene copies Bratz! It's not TRUE!I LOOOVE My Scene Dolls there GORGEOUS!Her clothes are beautiful!I hate when people say there to sexy, there not!"
1,Poor Role Model,"If my daughter dressed like this or held this style as an ideal, I would cry and cry and cry. What a sad testimony for where we are as women in our culture today-- yes, girls, you too can be viewed as purely sex icons to be used by men who clearly desire to see you in as little clothes as possible. Surely dressing like this will lead you to lifelong love and fulfillment and self respect-- dressing like this shows a sense of ""style"" and ""fun"" and will never lead you to be used and abused and exploited by men who will assess your self worth solely by how much you titillate them. Get a grip! Girls, we deserve so much better!"
3,My name is Ranee and I think this doll is ok-teriffic,She is so much fun. And she lasts forever. But she is not a good role model. She dosen't dress appropriatley. Overall she's pretty good. If it wasnt for her clothes I would give her a 5. But she does deserve a 3.
5,Punk Princess? (LGP3LNC here),"Please answer me, Sara,And Chelsea Churro!Chelsea Churro,THAT WAS THE BEST GUIDE ON AMAZON.COM!I AM SO PROUD OF YOU!Most people would`nt go that far.And I am touched that Sara and I are your faves!I`m so happy ********MY SCENEQUEEN*********is back from her trip to Swedin(Pardon me if I spell that wrong.)LGP3LNCEVERYTHING LUVERFOREVERIN ALL ETERNITYROCK SQUARED"

(my favourite teen celebrity and doll!)Sincerly, a bratz and myscene fan(and LINDSAY LOHAN!)"
5,"Great Video, a must have for every CRASS fan",Thiis video shows the clippings of videos used during CRASS performances. The scenes are in black and white and the quality is like watching it throught a TV from the 70's. However if CRASS is one of your favorite bands of all time (like me) this video is a must have because it portrays a great majority of what CRASS was about. All I have to say is you are in for a real treat if yuou order this.
4,"Works well, but has an aluminum fitting...","This product is well made, but the fitting required is made of aluminum, which has been linked to dementia, when used for cooking or beverages.Garyin Tampa"
1,Prospective Buyers Beware,"This top is marketed as fitting Farberware electric percolators. They show it conjoined in the picture as a suggested option leaving the impression that it fits, is functional and possibly improves appearance. The Farberware electric percolator that I recently bought through Amazon has a top lid with no opening - completely solid. Thus, if the glass top being marketed here fit at all, which it does not, all it could ever be is decorative. This is a very annoying product misrepresentation; the blame should be borne equally by the vendor and Amazon for not adequately researching the compatibility of items they market together."
2,More fragile than it looks!,"Although the price is right, these tops break quite easily. You cannot pull the top of the coffee pot off using this top as I have broken 4 of them already by doing so. So, if you can remember NOT to pull the top off with this glass piece, you'll be fine!"
1,Percolator top cannot be used,"When I ordered the Farberware percolator this clear glass percolator top was recommended. I ordered it at the same time because I previously found I needed a replacement top. However, this recommended top does not fit the percolator that I ordered."
2,Disappointingly fragile,"It does the job, but at $8 (with shipping) it is far too expensive. Worse, the glass is too thin to hold up to normal wear and tear. Mine broke off in my hand after only a few months. The old ones were made of such thick glass they were virtually unbreakable--they eroded away like a piece of geology but didn't break.However, I really like my Farberware Yosemite pot and its chintzy plastic dome was no longer serviceable. So, I ordered 3 of these tops (a lifetime supply, I thought) along with something else from the same merchant to cut per-unit shipping costs. The first of these shattered in mid-perk the first time I used it! Maybe the remaining two will last longer. (Or, maybe I'll die young.)The directions say, ""DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN"" Apparently, ""tight enough to stay on"" is too much. If they put a penny's worth more glass in these things, they'd be fine."
1,"False advertising, Doesn't fit Farberware, updated review","DO NOT buy this for your Farberware Yosemite pot. It's not a direct replacement.This is the same Fitz-all model #135 that you can get for $3.00 with free shipping.Also there is no reason to replace the perc top on the Farberware pot unless it becomes unservicable. The locking ring, if installed according to directions, allows hot water to accumulate and drain across the outside of the top during the pour, that's tacky. Reversing the ring solves that issue without exposing any sharp edges, but the aluminum ring is butter soft and deforms over time and will no longer hold. Good luck getting it centered and sitting square. Don't get suckered. Save your money!"
3,Need a replacement,"They don't make things like they used to. New percolators come with junk for glass tops. You have to keep replacements around. This one will work. But you might as well buy a couple, because surely you'll need to replace the replacement. My mother has my Grandmother and Great Grandmothers percolators. The tops on those are old and you could tell its of great quality. No room for pride and quality in todays industry. Quick,cheep, and easy. Thats the way of the present and future."
1,bad purchase,Seller said his glass percolator tops fit all Farberware percolators. This is not true. I have 2 and they don't fit either one of my lids.
4,good replacement,I have the Yosemite stovetop perculator that comes with the plastic top. High heat makes the plastic kind of melt after awhile. This glass top fits well and is a good replacement. The only thing I didn't care for was the cost to ship the item.
1,Does not fit as advertised,"Do not buy this percolator top for the Presto 02811, as it in no way will fit. Very misleading to think that Amazon would advertise to buy this in combination. Cost too much to return for credit. Change is fine as long as it is not misleading."
1,does not fit farberware 412!!,Buy all 3 for the price... but the glass top does not fit the perculator it is sold with! I have a glass top now for nothing. It was sold to fit the Farberware 412.
4,BACKUP PERCOLATOR TOP,I purchased this to back up the plastic top that came with the percolator. This looks to be good quality and although I have not yet needed to use it I was not disappointed.
4,Did not fit my West Bend Electric Percolator but I made it fit!,"I ordered this for an old West Bend Electric percolator and it didn't fit. But due to its simple elegant design I took a hammer and some metal working tools to the lid, made the hole larger and BAM! Instant upgrade. The fairly heavy duty glass perc top is really simple and well designed and now I can have good coffee again. I should get another 10 to 20 years out of my old West End. I hate those drip coffee makers, wimpy coffee sucks!"
4,pretty good,"its what you need to replace that plastic knob on any pot today. They could pony up a cork gasket and I would give 5 stars, because it can leak if you pour like a coffee addict."
1,This is supposed to fit what?!! Yeah right!,"Now.. I bought this.. ""Farberware 50124 Classic Yosemite Stainless Steel Percolator"" and decided to purchase this because it was glass and it would have removed the plastic bottom and sight glass of the original part that comes with the percolator.Well, it doesn't fit on there all that well, it seems smaller than it should be. Not olny that, it comes with an aluminum ring that is supposed to screw into the glass top to secure it and make a tight seal, well, you can't even get more that one turn on it, meaning you run out of threads to secure it.There must be another glass top that would fit better on this percolator.This does not fit 100%But... It is made well"
1,Does not fit...,"This item does not fit the newest version of Farberware's Yosemite Percolator. The threaded portion of the glass cap is too narrow and too short. The locking piece that comes with it works fine except, the black plastic insert of the stock Yosemite lid is too thick to allow the this glass cap to be threaded into even the new locking piece. Simply removing the stock black plastic insert is not an option because then the new glass cap is too loose and can't be tightened enough. I cannot recommend this item for the newest Farberware Yosemite Perc. Perhaps older versions..."
5,A must have!,"I bought this because the plastic top that came with my Faberware stovetop percolator wore out after a year of use. I haven't used this one more than a few days, but it already seems to be a far more superior product that the plastic version. It comes with a metal fixture that keeps it snug and I'd say it should last. Just to be safe I'll keep it out of the dishwasher.If you have a percolator and think the top is about to go, be safe and get this before it's too late. You do not want to go back to drip coffee from a plastic machine. GROSS! If you've never tried percolator coffee, do yourself a favor and give it a taste. You don't know what your missing!"
1,Clear glass top?,"I ordered this glass percolater top and recieved a small plastic top, I can't use at all, no use to ship back, wouldn't gain a thing,and no way to contact someone to help."
1,"""FITS WHEN IT WANTS TOO.""",THE ADJUSTER PLATE STEEL IS VERY SOFT AND THIS NULLIFYS THE ABILITY OF THE WELL MADE CLEAR GLASS PERCOLATOR TOP TO KEEP ITS SEAT. ANOTHER PRODUCT OFFERED BY THE U.S.OF A. THAT WILL DEFINITELY KEEP THE RECESSION GOING.{R.T.W.}P.S. ISN'T THIS THE REASON WE NEED FEEDBACK.
1,No fit for our perculator,"We were definitely misled with this product. It was suggested to purchase along with the Faberware 12 cup electric coffeemaker. There is no hole in the lid in which to attatch the glass top, so it is entirely of no use unless I dril a hole in the lid, which I am loath to do. So we will just enjoy the coffee, sans glass percolator top. I don't suppose anyone makes a glass lid that would replace the stainless steel one. Now that would be really neat. We could watch it perk!"
4,Just right,Just fits the opening and works well when used. Also sent very promptly. Am happy with the purchase and the company.
3,Worked Great - Customer Service Was Mediocre,"When our fish tank hinge unexpectedly broke, we luckily found this product online - it was the large size we needed without costing a fortune. The hinge itself worked great (we had to replace the whole tank six months later due to failing seam in the glass), but the customer service was somewhat lacking. I paid extra to for expedited shipping because we needed the hinge fast to keep the cats from jumping on top of the tank and falling in, but it took them over a week to ship an 'in stock' item, which means I didn't get the hinge for nearly a week and a half though I paid more."
3,ok product,even though it took forever to get to my house it was in ok condition and an ok product over all
4,At last a book about good kids,"This was a really good book about real kids. Kids that don't have to get drunk or have sex. I liked it a lot. The strike was cool, but it made me realize, how hard it would be to stand up to everyone and miss out on your senior year. More like this one please."
3,Not the Best,"I found this book dissapointing and boring. The older brother Russ, was unreasonable, annoying, and upseting to me, and there was no solid reason for that behavior at the end of the book. In addition, the main character, Kelsy Gene whines about it and does nothing until the situation spirals out of control. The whole book is just description of procrastination. And of course, everything worked out perfectly at the end. In addition, the short romance scences (and they were short) seemingly had no meaning and nothing to do with the plot. In addition, i had the feeling that teenagers weren't being represented accuratly. Perhaps it was the descriptions or something, or maybe I'm just overanalyzing. But i didnt not find this book an enjoyable ready and was upset at myself over wasting time finishing the book. There are better books out there...."
2,Not enough for exam,"Although I barely squeeked by this final exam , this book was definitly not enough info for the test. Not even the format of the practice exams was the same as the test. The test had tons of enter the command on the blank line (rather than multiple choice as the book presents them) as well as questions on interpreting sniffer output, which was not mentioned once in the book. I recomending that everyone try another book because this book didn't give much ""test relevent"" info, nor did it give an idea of what to expect on the test"
2,"Good reference, but bad test prep","While this guide provided quite a bit of useful information that I have been able to use frequently in my work environment, I do not think that it did an adequate job of reviewing the materials that I encountered on my exam. I passed the exam, but only by a slim margin, and only because of some material from other tests that I was able to remember. I cannot divulge the exact areas that I felt the book came in lacking due to the Cisco Confidentiality Agreement, so I can only say that this book alone will likely be inadequate as a sole test preparation resource. However, I would definately recommend this as a supplementary resource due to its potential real-world benefits."
2,It's OK.,"Remember that this is an ""exam cram"". It is a refresher for those that already know the material. As such, it is a good enough book.If you don't already know the material or don't have at least a year of hands on experience, this book won't do the job.If the book alone is applied to the test, the best that you can hope for would be 70%.The book is mostly accurate, with few typos, but it does not cover everything."
5,Excellent Resource!,This book was a great aid for the support exam. Albeit I will admit that you need to have an additional resource with this book .. the author takes the time to explain some real world troubleshooting scenarios that can be applied to your network immediately. Passed with over 900.
2,Not enough for exam,This is a hard test. One book can't do it. This one wasn't even close. I failed very badly. Hate this test and I blame this book for me failing! Urgh!
5,Best family book ever!,"This is the best book a family can have! We use this book more than our dictionary! Whether I am spending time with my pre teen kids or my toddler nephews this book offers us something fun and easy to do. All the classic games, indoor and out are in here - it is a great reminder to see them again, and learn new ones as well. All of the directions are easy to follow. Buy this book and start having fun!"
1,Truly a useless movie,"After watching movies like Trashed, Addicted to plastic, Blue Gold, Frontline Poisoned Waters etc., this movie truly falls short. This movie consists entirely of a bunch of schmucks wasting their time assembling huge quantities of the items the average American uses throughout his or her life and presenting it to a backdrop of feel-good music. Virtually o mention is made of pollution, exhaustion of resources, social impact, etc. A moment is spent on species loss. They go into no detail and provide no argument whatsoever. But if you want to see thousands of milk cartons lined up, or know how many times your child's diapers would wrap around the earth (and see them assembled in a giant pile), by all means watch this sorry film."
3,Yikes,"This documentary won't provoke deep thought, but it is pretty horrific to see how much one person will consume on average in a lifetime and how much waste people throw away. It really shows that small things do add up into great sums. Horrific...visually this is a confirmation of how important each of us need to take environmental conservation to heart."
3,Nice intro to RE Investing and Foreclosures,"I have read a few books on RE Investing and am currently doing my first rehab. This book is a nice intro to some areas I didn't know much about such as foreclosures and had some case studies of actual deals, however, it still seemed quite topical and could have had much more detail in many areas. The writer further attempts to share his experiences and provide motivation to anyone to get started, including himself, as this is his first book."
4,Autobots lives in Earth to stop the evil decepticons.,It is a four star because disc two skips a little bit. But I enjoyed them. Blitzwing is my only favorite decepticon!
1,Worst Transformer show ever,"This show looks cheap and let's face it they don't even look like robots! It shouldn't even be called Transformers! I keep waiting for the next episode in which they fight Bob the Builder or the Teletubbies. Seriously how can anyone like how these ""robots"" look with their bad proportions and sloppy looking style? Stay away from this one and hopefully one day we will get a Transformer show with good writing AND looks cool."
4,Good kids show that brings back memories,I grew up watching the original Transformers cartoon and have watched many of the subsequent cartoons that have followed. This one is the first one that mixes the old series and puts a new twist on the characters. My four year old loves this series and I am having a good time seeing him get excited about something I loved when I was a child. The series is easy to follow and is very kid friendly. There are references made throughout the show to the original cartoon. Originally I objected to the new direction of the show but it has grown on me and seeing that my son likes it is a huge plus. I have bought many of the toys from this series for my son and he enjoys watching the show and playing with the toys while he watches.
2,too expensive,"too expensive for a not so great adaptation. Aldo i love everything that come out about Transformers, exept this encarnation."
3,Not what I remembered,"The episodes are OK at best. I compare them to the first the first two seasons of the SIMPSONS; Homer has the ""different"" voice and Bart is the main character. Here, Optimus Prime sounds ""funny,"" Megatron does not look the same, Starscream is nowhere and they all work with and fight with humans. I know the later seasons will be much better."
5,A beautiful cycle for a beautiful voice,"This C.D. is a real gem. It stands as a testement to the sheer beauty and artistry that is Kathleen Battle as well as the genius of Andre Previn, author Toni Morrison and the various other American Composers and librettist featured on this disc. Kathleen Battle's voice is at it's silvery best, rich with emotiveness, expression and artistic grace. A wonderful blend of neo- classic, post-romantic and twentieth century music this is any music buffs forte, and worthy of being in any singers library."
5,Honey is an under statement,Just put it on and dim the lights. A glass of wine would go nicely with it also.
3,Not too bad,"I bought this blanket and the service was fast in coming and received in perfect condition. The problem I'm having is that one side heats a little hotter than the other side. The controls are a little inconvenient. The dials are a little hard to turn (no ""traction"")."
2,It's a blanket that doesn't warm,"Regrettably, like some other Biddeford customers--see other sizes, too--after a couple seasons, this blanket's electronics failed: issued an error message and failed to warm. We contacted Biddeford company but they didn't reply."
4,quintissential post-2000 indie rock,"If you like the Postal Service or similar bands, you'll like this. Top notch structure, very catchy (All the Arms around You rivals the Shins for pure hummability), with the sort of laid back vocals that are impossible not to like if all you want is something to chill back to.This seems short, but there's not that much to be said. All the songs are solid, they vary in speed but none are ultra slow or ultra fast. Great music to serve as background to any laid back activity."
1,Don't buy from this seller!!!!,I bought this item last December 2009. They gave me a bottle whose contents will expire on June 2010!!! Amazon should ban this seller from their site!!!
1,Movie Supports Blashpemy,"The writer of this film posed as Jesus in a portrait in this film even though he knows that it is blasphemy. I find it shocking that the director agreed to include it in this film and Jesus is most likely not 'white'. Romeo and Juliet is a great love story, but this ruined the movie for me."
4,Pleased with all but installation,"My paddling partner and I recently installed the Brunton 70P in each of our boats. We're pleased that the unit is watertight; is easy to read at a distance of five or so feet; and functions well at many attitudes. We'll have to see how it holds up over time, but at this point it looks like a great unit.Our criticism is minor: we opted to bolt the units through our decks, rather than use the screws provided, and we found that the screw holes in the brass mounting plate (underneath the black face plate) on the unit have some stamping around them (part of it through the plate, by design) that makes it at least difficult (I found it impossible) to drill out those holes any larger without tearing the mounting plate right around them. I believe this hasn't compromised the integrity or water-tightness of the installation, but it would have been easier if there'd been no special treatment around the screw holes."
3,listing not really clear,"I was under the impression this listing was for genuine Lennox furnace filters. The ad gave that impression, and was not clear that this item is a non-Lennox replacement. The listing title said the filter was 'by Lennox'. It even listed the Lennox model number of the filter. The seller did ship the filters promptly, and they seem ok, but they are not as sturdy as the Lennox filters. I should have inquired further before I made the purchase."
4,A great MO compilation for new fans,"'20,000 Watt R.S.L' is a nifty CD release spanning the hits and well known songs of Midnight Oil's later years. Track 1 to 12 are of well known and popular hits such as; The Power & The Passion, The Dead Heart, Blue Sky Mine and Beds Are Burning. Tracks 13 to 18 are hits from later works of Midnight Oil in there 20 odd years of performing.It's a great CD for new fans of this great Australian fair dinkum band who sing songs that feel most precious to them. This is also a good keepsake for any Midnight Oil Fan, old or new. Whilst we may not always agree with the views of MO, they always have put their views across in such an entertaining medium."
5,"Excellent, loud, full-time Midnight Oil",High-powered compilation of Midnight Oil big hits. A must for the fan
4,Midnight Oil is a band with a message....,"Normally I don't like socially conscious music but Midnight Oil's is the exception as they combine great music, passion and a cause that is meaningfull yet not to overbearing. Many of their songs focus on the environment, destruction of world resources and pollution. Most will be familiar with Beds are Burning....the bands biggest hit from the late 80's. Many of the songs are excellent as they capture one band's plea for change in musical composition. The songs are pretty simliar to Beds are Burning but they have enough variety to keep most of the album interesting.Bottom Line: I haven't listened to the any of Midnight Oil's actual albums so I can't say if this compilation is all you really need or not. I would imagine so but then again most of the songs are pretty good so there might be some more out there."
2,worst vocalist on the world,for me...this band had the worst vocalist of all the rock and roll world....He doesn't seems to sing...he seems to vomit...
3,Nothing special,"I thought I knew Midnight Oil. I first heard them on MTV in the 80's. I really liked the tune ""Beds Are Burning."" However, after listening to this album, I discover I hardly knew them or their music at all. I really wanted to enjoy this album, but I could not. Musically speaking, most of the tunes are devoid of harmony, balance and melody.When I listen to songs, I listen for the music first and then the lyrics. If the music, the construction of the tune, doesn't grab me, then I reject it. I gave this album a fair shake. I did not just listen to it once and then reject it. I played it multiple times."
3,better than nothing,"I continue to buy this series and have several cities so far in my collection and each one is around 30 minutes long. They give a narrated tour of the city with stops at the major attractions, art, culture, food, shopping and history. That is alot to pack into 30 minutes so you can imagine they move quickly from one thing to another. I usually watch again at least twice before I go on a trip. If you can get a great deal on these, they are worth the price."
4,An enjoyable RTE production from Ireland,"It is thirty years since I last saw this production and whilst there is a certain roughness in the editing (a lack of slickness) coupled with overly orchestrated background music, it is no doubt that this production remains enjoyable. Mind you, its portrayal of unspeakable poverty and the lock outs can make it feel kind of depressing but life was unbelievably hard for working class people in those days in the tenements and this comes through.Note if you are a Peter Ustinov fan, he appears only briefly as the King and says not a word!"
4,Sugar-free caramels,These assorted caramels were very good. They were soft and creamy. There were 3 different flavors in one bag and all were very good. Didn't taste at all like a sugar-free product. My kids really like them.
5,Fun -- even for the 100th time!,"My 14 month old has been watching Clifford since he was 3 months. Clifford is not only entertaining for children, but I find myself watching it too. Even after watching this tape over and over (in fact I can recite the entire episode of ""Stormy Weather"") neither one of us is sick of it. The episodes are uplifting and fun. Who couldn't resist a two story friendly dog?"
2,Needs a good kick...,"Vienna Philharmonic, Previn, Richard Strauss... on paper this sounds like a sure-win formula for a classic Strauss CD. Not quite so. The first glitch is Deutche Grammomphon's loathsome 4D technology - it captures the VPO's sound badly: woolly bass frequencies, bloated mid-range frequencies, and an attenuated top-end. Fortunately, it did not completely warp the sound of the Viennese strings - there are moments of sweet beauty to be savored, particularly in the Intermezzo and Capriccio extracts.Unfortunately, the other injury to the VPO comes in the form of Previn. It seems he was in a sonnambulistic mood of sorts, and the entire performance suffers from an interminable haze of laziness --- rhythms are often slack and droopy, particularly in the ""Rosenkavalier"" piece and musical expression often turgid. Listen to Rudolf Kempe's recordings of the same music and see how much more lilt, affection and zip could be put into this music.Not a success."
4,Well Received Gift,This item was a well received Christmas gift for 75-80 year olds. They enjoyed the Dean Martin Variety Show in earlier years and fondly enjoy reminiscing about good times.
3,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Once again those who claim to know what the fans want - chopped up the episodes. And Extras don't impress me - How about some EXTRA DEAN - not interviews of people who knew him. I only watched the first two of these last night - both cut to about 30 mins and NEITHER OF THEM CONTAINED THE SPOT WITH DEAN WHEN HE JUMPS ON THE PIANO AND SINGS HIS SOLO AT THE END OF THE SHOW. I'm not buying the PEGGY LEE, BOB HOPE, JOEL GRAY collection - I'm a DEANO fan and want to hear HIM sing and watch him joke around with the piano player, etc."
1,A decent show reduced to bits and pieces,"As with all too many DVDs of this type, we aren't given entire shows but heavily edited versions. As one reviewer pointed out, there was a lot of crap in the originals (bad comics, singers who didn't make it, etc) but you need to let US be the critics and I think we are capable of using a fast-forward button. I was a teen when these were aired and have fond memories (obviously only remembering the good parts) but this isn't the set to relive them. Avoid it."
2,Some shows edited down to 18 minutes!,"Original shows = *****DVD Presentation = ** (due to heavy edits)I agree with the others, it is so sad that these shows have been cut in half, some whittled down to 18 minutes.In the opening titles they even left in the names of the guests you will not see.This ""BEST OF"" highlights collection is only marginally better than the previous DVD release.Yes, you will laugh but you will also cry when the show ends 20 minutes later."
5,Love Dean Martin - Defined cool,I look forward to mixing a couple martinis and watching these shows with my dad. He is gonna love this.
3,"well, umm, err...ahhh...","I vaguely remember Dean's show when I was really young and was looking forward to this. I held off buying any of the Guthy Renker sets so I could get whole shows, so the bits would have context. What we have here are heavily edited shows. I understand the hassles of getting rights cleared, however with the edits as they are, I can only assume that these are marginally better than the Garrison sets that were sold through mailorder. And since this show is impossible to find out there, I would have preferred more shows over the interviews with people who knew Dean. This particular set has some fun moments, however some of the musical numbers are extremely dated and corny, while some of the sketches also fly low on the chuckle-meter. I remember this show being alot funnier than these episodes - the moments where Dean goes off-script are far and away the best. I'll probably pick up some of the Garrison sets cheap to see if it's any better."
3,GOOD...... AS FAR AS IT GOES,"Firstly these ARE very entertaining discs. They show off, the too often underrated skill of Dean in comedy and his ability to work with guests. His guests are often great with some absolute gems of performance on here. I also love Dean when he sings with others, he was a master at that. The rapport he establishes with his guests is also amazing. BUT there are yawning gaps where Deans solo songs should have been. I can only speculate these are missing due to copyright. And that is definately a big loss Shame this could have been a grand Slam but its just a hit."
2,Agreement about the edits,"I will agree with the other reviewers here on Amazon. I purchased this at the warehouse and viewed the first 3 episodes with my wife tonight. The episodes are between 23 and 28 minutes long. These are edited down to about half the original broadcast. Do not get me wrong. Some of the skits are very funny. The barbarshop scene w/ orsen wells and Jimmy Stewart made me laugh for its 5 minutes of wit. But the episodes all have end credits that show snapshots of scenes from the show broadcast, and you can guess easily what you misses on the DvD realease.In addition, the audio mixing is terrible. Watching this DvD with a 5.1 system, you loose vocal in the center channal at the end of the first episode/ disk 1. If these broadcasts were recorded in Mono, realease them in Mono. Fans will not criticize Dvd producers for that, but I will criticize the mixing here.Dean Martin had a great show on NBC. Keep it simple. Realease the episodes in Mono and unedited."
