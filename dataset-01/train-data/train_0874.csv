5,I love Langenscheidt!,"I have come to rely on Langenscheidt dictionaries. I have them for English to Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese. As a translator (English-Spanish-English and Italian-English), I find the dictionaries easy to use and the definitions precise and extensive, covering most idiomatic usages."
4,review,Quite graphic and rather entertaining. The only thing is that the story is short. Perhaps I was just under the impression that it was a graphic NOVEL.
5,Absolutely perfect for fans of De Sade and Satan,"For fans of occult themes and depravity, this is the (un)holy Grail. There is no fluff in the storyline at all: it gets right to the point and never lets up. I'm no art critic, but the images seem adequately drawn and colored, as far as I'm concerned.Some Satanically-inclined nuns in a convent conjure the devil and submit willingly to his ferocious Sexual appetite and each others' sex toys. I won't get into details, but it covers every sort of Sadeian perversion. Fabulous!!"
2,not pleased with electric shaver,"For Christmas I purchased the Eltron S Blade shaver for my son for Christmas. At first it was ok to use even though it didn't do as good as I would have liked. It seemed to shave too close in some areas and not close enough in other areas. So my son always had alternating stubble and red spots on his face. Then in about March, the two red screws on the side (that hold the top part on) broke off. So I had to manually place them in thier respective spots and hold them on until I got the top or cover on. The razor still worked ok despite this new inconvenience. Then in April I tried to open the retractible blade (for sideburns) and the whole side blade and other pieces fell off. The razor is now un-useable. I paid over $100.00 at the time and don't think it was worth the money. My son had used an eltron before (QVC or HSN model) that was only $18.00. I think that model worked better than this one !"
3,Batman Kit,Please be aware that this is templets and stickers only! You still need to buy a car kit.
1,Be aware that this does not come in usable condition,This item is shipped with no antenna and no lanyard or belt clip (or charger). Pretty useless if you are replacing a lost transmitter as I am.
1,poor replacement,"I PURCHASED THIS BECAUSE I LOST MY TRANSMITTER. THIS REPLACEMENT HAS NO ANTENNA OR BELT CLIP! THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT IN THE AD, BEWARE."
3,Time frame's a bit off,"Ok, the book is ok, but my biggest beef is that the timeframe is off. The Rolex Kentucky is held the last week of April, and the Kentucky Derby the next weekend. The last 5 books have it all messed up. But, that's just me, I'm not saying that the books are bad. They're just a bit messed up in the time department."
3,ehhhhh....,"This book was OK. I don't think that it was Karle Dickerson's best book in this series. I kinda thought that it was boring, but you should definently read it though so then you can fine out about some things."
5,Great book,All of the Thoroughbred books are great. My daughter loves them. She sits and reads for hours and hours. She has read the entire series up to this point
4,"*Gr8 book, but...*","This is a gr8 book if you love reading about eventing. It's an interesting storyline about Parker and his 2 horses, Foxy and Ozzie in England. But... when is the Kentucky Derby story going to come? It keeps on being stalled!A few books ago, there were a few weeks left until the Derby. What's the delay? We want to read it!!!We want to know who's gonna win: Star, Image, or Gratis?¿? Star has the heart, Gratis has the speed and agressiveness, and Image is just plain fast and loves to be in front of the pack. We are getting impatient only because we love this series and we want to know what's going to happen!All in all, these books are awesome if you're a horse lover.Thoroughbred series is the best!!!:-)"
1,No mac support!,"No mac support! Not just ""no mac drivers on the included CD"", but ""no mac drivers exist that will cause this thing to print"".I really wish I had discovered that before lugging it upstairs & setting it up."
1,Reset Button Never Work,"When there is an error , for example , if paper size is A4 instead of Letter, the printer will alarm. There NO way to reset the printer when it has error, even if you shutdown your computer , or shutdown the printer temporarily.This printer still REMEMBER all the pages that were sent to it after you turn it off, and you can not use the Reset button to clear those pages.My only solution in this case is : turn the printer off in 1 night, and check it back in the next morning. Usually, 1 night is long enough for the printer to forget the error and reset by itself.This printer has very good print quality when it works . However, when it does not work, you will have a miserable time to fix it.After a lot of customers complained about this product, Canon still sell this printer in the market, without fixing the problem or recalling the defective product. This carelessness will destroy the credibility of Canon."
1,Camera quality doesn't carry over. Cheap tool = expensive tool.,"When it works, it works with quirks. Quirks that are obvious design flaws. It is as if canon deliberately crippled this printer to make it unsuitable for office use. Ours ran fine for 18 months, then it started giving paper size errors that could not be corrected, resulting in lost faxes that really hurt our business.I recommend going to a brick-and-mortar costco and seeing what they offer as their most expensive printer. Their product line is pretty well vetted and well suited to a small business office."
2,"Good, but won't scan with 64 bit systems","We have had the MF5750 for a few years now and it has been a good reliable machine, with the one quirk that the paper output tray doesn't catch legal size paper, so it ends up falling all over the floor.However, we have modernized our operating system, and moved to Windows 7 64 bit. Now the scanning function doesn't work anymore. I had to go to the Canon website and download updated drivers for the printer, which went pretty smoothly. But you have to use their proprietary MFToolbox to use the scanning function. This application just doesn't seem to work, (yes, I downloaded the updated version) and from what I can find on the internet, this was a problem with Vista 64 bit also.It's a shame, because I might have to break something to take it in for warranty so I can get a machine that works with modern software.If you are reading this, and have one of these machines, the updated drivers are located here: [...]"
4,V2 Black Pro Rechargeable LED Light (COSLL7741) Category: Led Flashlights,"This is an excellent product. I've owned several. I give them to my residents. The light is very bright , the charges last a long time and the brightest area of the light is in the center. Unfortunately, they're getting hard to find."
1,"It collapses all right, all the time and into the food","It collapses all right, all the time. It cannot support its own weight and drops down into the food. What poor execution of a reasonable idea. Flip a paper plate over and have a better cover."
2,Always flat,Mine will not stand up as pictured. I bought it mainly for it's dome feature and the one I received is so soft it always collapses.
1,Collapses Under Its Own Weight- Use a Silicone Bundt Cake Mold Instead,"It cannot hold itself up, it will fall into your food. The material thickness at the fold points is so thin that you can see light through it. It sounds like there is a quality control problem here with the material thickness, as some people report the problem and some do not. Buy one if you're feeling lucky. UPDATE: I bought a silicone bundt cake mold and popped the center inside out like a chimney out the top and it works great as a microwave splatter cover."
5,The best book on a miscarriage of justice I've ever read,"A Promise of Justice by David Protess and Rob Warden is by far the best book on a miscarriage of justice I've ever read, and I've read virtually all of them. The story Protess and Warden tell is at once sad and uplifting. Occasionally you forget that what you are reading is true because the story moves with the pacing of a thriller novel. It's a page-turner that I simply couldn't stop reading, finishing it in one sitting. Protess and Warden have written a masterpiece that should be required reading throughout the land."
3,Not as good as #1 and #2,"After reading Essential X-Men #1 and #2, I went with #3 and remembered why I had stopped reading the X-Men when I was younger. Although the stories are good, I got so used to John Byrne's artwork that everything afterwards just didn't feel like the X-Men I knew."
5,X-Men for ever,"I am a complete fan of the Marvel Mutant Superheroes X-Men, and because of it, let me tell you that this series of ""Essentials"" are one of the best that ever happened to comics. If you like the X-Men, then you must have the X-Men Essential series. I am now waiting for the 5th book....."
1,Think again about this purchase...,"I had heard all sorts of positive reviews about this album and I thought I'd take the plunge... since I'm a long time fan of the JA - especially enjoying the Jorma/Jack/Marty/Grace creativity I thought that this might be worth digging into, if even half of what the reviewers wrote were in sync with me.Unfortunately, I found this CD to be uneven and even 'juvenile' at times.Perhaps I wasn't in the right 'mood', but if I need to be then I missed the time for this music as I gave that up several decades ago.I was truly hoping for something special that spanned the years - like David Crosby's fabulous 'If I can only remember my name'.I'll probably listen to it again and if I feel the same way I'll donate it to the library."
2,Five stars for the music...,"...one star for Kantner's mushy vocals. Still worth hearing, but thank Grace for the fast-forward (which us old vinyl types did not have available to us). The poor schmoe never could carry a tune."
5,The Good Old Days,"God how I miss the vibe of the time in which this seminal album was made! Kantner and Slick were fearless and their creativity was peaking, making this a definitive representation of the era. The sound is great on this iteration and I was touched by the beauty of Grace's piano playing...put this one on late at night after some good wine or maybe a puff or two..."
5,Very in a groove.,"Upon the demise of Jefferson Airplane, and the cognition of Jefferson Starship a few famous friends dropped by and added their spirits to this mix. And, a masterpiece was launched."
3,Todd Snider - Major Label Pressure Makes For An Average Album,"Snider moved away from the Jimmy Buffett / Michael Utley camp on this one being released on MCA and not Margaretville. It would also be his last album on a major label. This is probably my least favorite Snider release. A lot of this sounds like he was under record company pressure to come up with a sound that was more appealing to mainstream radio. About half of this album sounds like an imitation of Tom Petty. Nothing against Petty, but I have always enjoyed Snider's songwriting abilities and a lot of this just seems a bit contrived. The album rocks harder than most of his other ones and he also throws in a cover of Steve Miller's ""The Joker"". Overall there are a lot of other Snider albums I would get before this one, but it is still worth owning if you are a fan."
4,really excellent rock recording.,"i have seen todd snider live 5 times, and would recommend you see him if you get the chance. he is about as entertaining a live performer as they come. unlike his live performances, which are folk singer affairs (just him and an acoustic guitar), this is a rock and roll recording. and a really excellent one, at that. ""rocket fuel,"" ""i am too,"" I am two,"" the excellent psychedelic ""guaranteed,"" and ""godsend,"" are all fine pieces of rock and roll. the great, great song here, though, is ""can't complain,"" which is one of my all-time favorite songs by anyone, period. every time i hear that song i have to hit the back button on my cd player and immediately play it again. it's a song so good you have to hear it twice in a row. kudos also should go to will kimbrough, who lays down tasty rock guitar all over this cd. highly, highly recommended."
2,A tribute that doesn't deliver,"I was SO MOVED when I first watched Hedwig that I bought the DVD, Soundtrack and Broadway Soundtrack. What a masterful bit of writing and performance; just astonishing. After I listened to this tribute, I just couldn't write a positive review. The magic and emotion is not there. The feeling is gone.I know this review is short, but not much really needs to be said other than: Save your money and buy the original."
3,I love Cyndi...the Breeders...,About half the songs are really good...They Might Be Giants was suprisingly disappointing.The Breeders and Cyndi Lauper really take center stage with this disc!
3,Aspen Gold is a good read,"While I was very disappointed in the quality of the ebook version, the story is excellent if a bit slow to develop. There are so many typographical errors in the ebook that it is distracting. There is no excuse for this; the book is overpriced due to this factor."
5,Incredible performance,This is without a doubt a recording comparible to the great Guarneri or Julliard quartets. It remains a mystery to me why the Colorado quartet is not better known or for that matter internationally famous. I recommend this for all true lovers of classical music
5,These are wonderful!,"The performances here are luscious, musical, perfectly in tune, flowing, dramatic as necessary. And they have that Brahmsian gemuetlichkeit that is so necessary for this music. Are we living in a great chamber music performance era, or what?"
1,Don't waste your money on this....,"This is a silly compilation of Judas Pirest videos, that only serve for a good laughing. Don't waste your time on it, unless you wanna see tha band dressed like Motley Crue (on the TURBO videos) or watch Halford give over the top fake performance for the videos of BREAKING THE LAW."
2,Unbeliavable,"People like to lie. To say that all the videos in this collection are great is nothing but a BIG lie. Ok, theyre are sometimes naive, from a time when awful MTV did not rule de rock-video standards. Thre is some freshness also. Sometimes they ar also funny.ut the true is that they simply are not that great!! Also, it's only 40 minutes long."
4,Exploration of the latest tomb KV63,"This documentary shows us the exploration of latest tomb, KV63, which is only 5 meter next to Tutankhamun resting place of KV62 in Valley of the Kings. Its finding such as sarchophagus, alabaster jar, etc is an interesting exhibit and give us a hint that this tomb may be linked to Tutankhamun.This documentary also shows us how egytologist works at sites with cooperation from SCA. Discovery team interviewed egyptologists when they do the job at working spot. Those who expect grand finding from this latest tomb may be disappointed. But those who want to get update to latest information, learn how they do the job at Valley of the Kings should not be missed.This DVD unit is DVDRW, not normal DVDROM. Be sure that your player can play this format."
1,It is not well documented,"I didn't like the documentary. It has some mistakes in the information. It should have options in the menu, with subtitles or more language options."
3,Emotion sacrificed to musical competence,"Musically highly competent, but where's the Italian passion? This is Vivaldi we're talking about! Slow movements are sluggish, the faster ones lacking emotion. Perhaps suitable as an introduction to Vivaldi, for someone who's never heard it before. My own experience is based on the vivacity of the Virtuosi of England (performing the Four Seasons) and the Parley of Instruments (the Lute and Mandolin Concertos),and in comparison, the performance of the Capella is decidedly lack-lustre."
5,A wonderful book for mother's to share,"I paged through this board book when my daughter was only weeks old. I had to buy another copy by the time she turned a year old. We had read it so many times, it had been chewed and spilt on, was just about dead. I ended up buying a new one and she still has it at age 3. I think this is an excellent book for mothers to read to their daughters and sons. The pictures are large and bright and the poem is adorable. Being a single mom, I try to find books dealing with it at her age, and I thought this was a perfect one due to it's simplicity. I reccommend this to any mother. I have even bought a few extra for fellow mother friends. It is just a wonderful book!"
5,Excellent Product!,I ordered this CD used with reservation. Received a great item at a great price. David Harness can mix! Missing Club Universe!
3,Loveknot (Tyler No.12),Read the Tyler series up to this point but still wanted to find out about killer. Each book can be read separately or as part ofongoing series.
2,Disappointing end of the series.,"What a disappointing ending to the series! Judson's trial is over, but we still don't know who killed Margaret. Luckily, the guy just shows up in town with a slightly different name. Seriously, this was see-able a million miles away. Also, I was looking forward to the culmination of Alyssa's romance with Edward, but that's been building for about 8 books now, all that was left was to admit they loved each other. Unfortunately, Ingalls F & M is failing, and instead of saving the business Edward decides to take it over. That goes over well. But, Alyssa gets over it and they're totally in love. The End."
1,I don't like it at all,This sport suit seems to be made form american footbal players. The material looks like a cheap one. The pant is streched on the bottom side.I bought one size M but it's XL (european). I won't recommended at all. It's ugly.
3,Stencil film,"This item probably only works best with flat surfaces (not my wall) and only surfaces that do not peel off. You see, I tried to create stencils on a poster board but this material peels the top layer of the board. This product also did not come with instructions or DOs and DON'Ts or where you can use it. I had to look for a specific type of paint for it to work.However, I'll recommend this as a cheaper alternative to the Cricut's vinyl paper."
5,Simply great!,"The quality was what I expected and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a low calorie, healthy and organic breakfast option."
1,Um...no.,"I am trying to eat better and this cereal was recommended to me. After I purchased it, I opened it up and ate a few puffs dry. Not too bad. However, as soon as I added milk to the mix, the cereal took on a very slimy texture. I choked the bowl down as fast as I could before it became even nastier. I would not recommend this product at all. There's got to be something better out there."
2,"GREAT CEREAL, BUT OUTDATED BOX INFO. CROSSED OFF!!!!","WHILE RICE IS A FOOD STAPLE THAT, IF STORED PROPERLY, CAN STAY NUTRITIOUS AND SAFE FOR CENTURIES, THIS WAS NOT A LEGAL TRANSACTION ON THE PART OF THE MANUFACTURER, AS THEY CROSSED OFF (OR AMAZON CROSSED OFF!!!) AJANUARY 2007 EXPIRATION DATE!!!!!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!! FORTUNATELY, I TRIED THE PRODUCT, AFTER CAREFUL INSPECTION, AND THE VACUUM SEALED BAGS SAVED THE FRESHNESS AND WERE NOT TAINTED WITH INSECTS, ETC. - THE FLAVOR WAS GRATIFYING - THUS 2 STARS..."
5,healthy cereal,"puffed kamut is a really tasty healthy cereal. it is very filling and satisfying. it contains no added suger, salt, or fat. very low in carbohydrates and calories. would recommend it to everyone concerned about their health. great nutritional value, at a great price through amazon."
5,Best Noodle Bowl Ever!,"This is my favorite noodle bowl of all time!The delish piece on top is deep fried tempura batter. There are some little veggie pieces in it. It has a lot of flavor to it as well, something like garlic or onion. Whatever it is, it is definitely yummy!The noodles are different than the average noodle bowl as well. The noodles are made with buckwheat, and have that whole wheat look to them.One of the great things about this bowl is the seasoning packet. It is divided into two sections, one for the base broth and then another for the spicyness. This way you can get the spice level just right for your tastes. It is a great broth too, not overly salty like some of them can be.The final point of awesomeness of this noodle bowl is that the name transaltes to green raccoon, and thats just cute. :)"
2,Wish I had read the reviews first,"I usually read reviews before buying an item, but did not in this case.My wife and I enjoyed this original series on PBS and I thought that is what was included. With 408 minutes and two discs, I assumed there would be close to twelve 30-minute episodes. What is actually on the cd's are ""snippets"" of the episodes, sometimes jarringly edited, presented by topic. That is fine if you enjoy navigating with your remote to find and watch a 30 second segment, but I would have much preferred the original show in it's original format. Why the producers felt it needed to be re-worked is beyond me.Five stars for Mr Pepin, but two stars for this poorly re-worked package."
2,Disappointing for viewers of the televised series,"Instead of containing each of the 30-minute episodes of the televised series in their entirety, in this DVD set, the episodes are cut up into short segments arranged by food category. And even though these segments are grouped together, you can only play each segment one by one. The original series itself is wonderful and very educational, so the content is still valuable, but in this format, it's almost unwatchable. I cannot imagine how anyone who truly appreciated this series would deem to cut it up in this manner. I hope that PBS will consider reissuing the original series in full episodes one day."
4,The Complete Pépin:Techniques and Recipes,"The Complete Pepin: Techniques and RecipesThe techniques are helpful, well-explained and beautifully executed. My only problem is there's no ""view all"" or ""view entire section"". I get to view one technique and get returned to the menu to manually select the next one."
4,A great instructional dvd,I love this dvd. It teaches you how to poach an egg to how to debone a chicken. I learned so many useful techniques by watching this dvd. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who's looking to get a bang for their buck.
1,Disappointed,"Very choppy and irrelevent information presented. There is little if any actual instruction. Another reviewer was under the impression it was a cooking dvd and was disappinted it was instructional. I was under the impression it was instructional and am sad it was just watching him cook --- I think this happened because the goal of the DVD is not well defined and therefore leaves everyone wondering what in the world they are watching.Even if the content was worhtwhile, the video has extremely short segments and there is no way to set it to play continuously even within one topic. Too bad Im a huge Pepin fan! :("
2,Not really awful,If you are a PB watcher you've seen all this stuff. I find the formatting cumbersome. If you haven't seen the shows on PBS there is a lot to learn here.
5,The Complete Pepin,I would highly recommend this video to any serious cook enthusiast. Jacque shows you how-to's in very simple steps. You can watch this as you cook or just before you start your meal.I would also recommend Jacque Pepin's Fast Food My Way. Very elegant dinners prepared in minutes! We love Jacque!!!!
2,Disappointing,"Yes I read all the reviews and gambled on the 5-star ratings given... soon as this came I got to watching it and sure enough it's as bad as the honest ones say. The vignettes presented have value but the structure is horrible. As already pointed out by previous posts this gives the core of the techniques but the navigation through the disk is just plain bad... amateurish at best. If you haven't watched the series then it likely won't matter. But I have and I'm sorely disappointed! Don't buy it at this price... this is a 2 for $5.99 video and wait until I donate mine to to Goodwill. Total ripped off and just like I won't return to a crappy restaurant I will not renew my membership with PBS! All it takes is one bad experience, eh."
1,A Joke,There is not any information given on this DVD that someone in grade school would not know. It was like being taught how to use a salt shaker.
5,Cooking Techniques for Aspiring Home Chefs,"I don't have time to take classes, but I absolutely love cooking, and soooo wish I had the time for formal training. I found this DVD set and am in love! I'm a food network junkie, and trust me-- this is above and beyond. The DVD set is expressly for the viewer to gain technique understanding, and it did just that! He walks you through how to do the basics, which end up aiding you in the more difficult/extensive things you attempt to take on in the kitchen! I've read about poaching eggs forever, and it was the missing piece to my puzzle when he showed you exactly how it's done-- he even does the 'perfect' omelet.If you're looking to pick up kitchen know how that will undoubtedly aid you in your future culinary endeavors (even if it's just in your own kitchen!) I would hands down recommend this DVD set!"
5,For the Intermediate Philosopher,"This is a wonderful book if you are already familiar with a bit of the philosophical-debate-on-free-will lingo. If not, then it will take a little more effort to become comfortable with what each of the authors is saying. Take heed, this is not a book that is willing to spoon feed or reinforce your intuitions about the nature of God's foreknowledge-- rather, it is a book in which the authors use insightful and rigorous arguments to heartily support their claims.Regardless of the other reviews on here about the authors, I find Craig's piece to be the most compelling. But, perhaps this claim is a bit negligent to the overall quality of the book. Foure Views is by far, a wonderful and insightful read if you are willing and wanting to take your understanding of theology a bit further."
1,S400 and now S410 memory card problems,I do not learn fast enough.I bought S400 and S410 for my daughters and they are both having same memory card problems. I sent these units for repair and it cost me $150. This is such a surprise that Canon is not handling this problem and I will recommend eveyone against this product.I had a problem with Canon Digital Camcoder and I thought this was my bad luck. I am convinced now not to buy any of Canon products from now on. I am a slow learner ...
1,Error message E18,If you do some research on this camera you will find a lot about an error message common to many Canon cameras called E18 which is related to the zoom lens getting stuck. Well I decided to go with it anyway citing these people as nuts. Wrong! I just got this E18 message after only 6 months of use and no drops of the camera. After doing some more research I've found that MANY MANY MANY people have experienced this problem as well. Insult to injury after a $300 camera failing on you is that Canon will fix it...free? no...for $117. Charging me for a flaw that seems to permeate all of your cameras? What an insult. I will never buy Canon again and suggest that you do so as well. I am pissed.
5,Just Excellent,"After reading all of the contradictions between customer reviews, reading countless online publications, and going to electronic stores I ended up buying the Canon S410. Sure people will complain about small things, but I find people complain about almost anything.The bottom line is when you are trying to get the best quality shots off quickly this is the camera. It's ability to calculate exposures and make rich, beautiful picures is just amazing. You can shoot in to the sun with this camera while standing in shade and still get beautifully exposed shots. I was worried that the camera was completely automatic. It actually is not. You can control exposure quite well (even take night photographs), use manual focus, and use as b/w. If you are an amateur photographer looking for something fun and light I highly recommend."
5,Don't pass on this camera...,"This is the most compact incrediable camera you can buy. It is my second one and I love it. You can learn how to operate this camera with out using your owners manual, adjust the camera to your personal settings, and carry it in your pocket. It is great for travel and everyday use. Don't pass on this camera...it is well priced through amazon.com and a must have!"
2,Bad pictures,"I have had this camera for 6 months, and have yet to be able to take a clear picture. Even on a small tri-pod, the images are still blurry. It appears the blurry quality is better, with the flash on, but I would suggest looking at another model, and Canon is hard to deal with when you do have a problem."
3,NO DATE STAMP,I bought this item based on the good reviews it has received. But I am surprised that it doesnot put date stamp on the pictures. This is the least of the features I would have expected in a DIGITAL camera. A 50$ film camera does that.Picture quality is good. I am really disappointed that it doesnot put date stamp on the pictures.
1,"Poor Focus, Redeye doesn't work","I was very disappointed with this comers. I had better results taking pictures with 2-year-old Kodak digital camera. The auto focus is very slow. The color is bad.I took many pictures of people in low light and most of the photos had severe red eye. The flash is very bright.The menu is difficult to navigate, and somewhat confusing.I have returned my cannon S410. The picture quality wasn't nearly as good as a cheap advantex film camera."
1,Great disappointment - Bad investment,"I have been having the infamous memory card error as well. Have lost many valuable photographs as a result. Have tried a new memory card and followed the support instructions on Canon's website, but no success. A great disappointment. Do not buy this camera."
4,Very Good Camera,"Positive:+ Good Battery Life+ Wonderful Photo Quality+ 3x Optical Zoom+ Wonderful Video QualityNegative:- No Manual Options- Only 32 MB Memory Card BundledIt's a great camera, unless you don't mind not having manual options."
1,"Stay away from the S400, S410, etc. cameras","Stay away from these cameras like a plague. My S400 got the infamous ""E18"" shortly after the warranty ran out. Then I did a search on the internet and was shocked to learn that this is a widespread problem with these cameras. Do a search on ""Canon E18"" on Google before first before buying..."
4,GREAT CAMERA,I JUST HAD TO WRITE BECAUSE I READ ON SOMEONE'S REVIEW THAT DIGITAL CAMERAS WILL NEVER TAKE THE SAME QUALITY PHOTOS AS SIMILAR PRICED REGULAR CAMERAS. HOGWASH. I HAVE A CANON ELPH THAT TAKES FILM AND THE CANON S410 DIGITAL AND THE DIGITAL CAMERA TAKES FAR SUPERIOR PRINTED PICS THAN THE FILM VERSION - BETTER CLARITY AND COLOR. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT FOR NEW DIGITAL USERS - DIGITAL IS SUPERIOR TO FILM CAMERAS HANDS DOWN. MY ONLY PROBLEM IS MY LCD SCREEN BROKE - I WAS CARELESS. BE SURE TO ALWAYS KEEP YOUR CAMERA IN CASE AT ALL TIMES WHEN NOT IN USE.
2,Design Defect in LCD - electronics failure,"I purchased this model camera as a retirement gift my parents in June 2004 as a highly portable digital substitute for their 35mm models. In December, they first experienced problems with the LCD viewer which displayed only partial images. The screen completely failed in January. The camera was evaluated by a local Canon repair store which had seen other similar failures. When the camera was sent for repair, Canon accused my parents of dropping the camera and charged $150 to fix it! This camera was NOT mishandled! Of course they offered to sell them a refurbished model from the rest of their dud supply. CONCLUSION: The images are great but the reliability is horrible."
5,Great little camera from Canon as usual,"I bought this camera as an upgrade from the S200. I can keep all my previous accessories and get the higher resolution and zoom features. It takes pictures faster than the S200 (focus, shutter, and flash seem faster) and still the same size and weight (in fact, I think it's a bit lighter). Plus, at $250 it's quite a bargain."
1,Great til it breaks down!,"Purchased the Canon S410 just over a year ago and it took many great photos until yesterday when the screen image suddenly turned into a tie-dye effect. The camera has been carried in a padded leather case and was not dropped or abused. I have since read reviews that mention the mysterious ""E18"" error but there was no message beforehand on my screen. If anyone has experienced this, please advise. Have recommended Canon Power Shot Elphs to many friends & family members but having read all the Amazon customer reviews that mention poor service from Canon, looks like I'll have to look for a non-Canon camera next. What a shame that such a great camera has had so many problems and turns into a lemon!"
4,"""WHATS""","It would be helpful if you included ""What's in the box"" as you do in other cameras. It would be helpful if I knew that a battery charger, for instance was included with the camera and what ever else is included. Thanks, ----WJH PS I also notice that the S410 is sold at Staples for $229.50."
1,beware dont buy this one,"I just got the dreaded e18 error message on this camera and its only two years old. canon has a problem with all of its retractible lenses and they get either jammed in the out or the in position and the camera wont power up, rendering this useless. canon will fix it for 175.00 but the problem, as i have found from others on the web will happen again. it is a mecanical flaw? and canon wont support you at all."
1,Memory Card Error,"I recently purchased this camera for a second smaller camera to supplement my Nikon D100. I had it 2 weeks when it began to display ""Memory Card Error"" and would not store any of my pictures. I don't have any problem with that same memory card in my other camera. I have the older 3MP powershot and have never had a problem with it. I have since returned it but wish I had listened to the reviews on this camera."
3,E 18 error re occurs,"i have used the S 400 for less than a year. the photo quality and manual controls are very good. battery charger system good.HOWEVER- for the third time in < 12 mos, the camera HAS FAILED. error message ""E 18"" appears, and you must return the camera to Canon for service. They have handled it n/c twice, and i expect they will again- BUT this lack of reliability is , in my opinion, a fatal flaw."
4,Good little camera,Canon's definitely got a good little camera with this Elph. I would strongly suggesty buying a larger capacity memory card as the one that comes with the camera only holds about 35 pictures.
1,What a lemon!,"I bought this camera after being a loyal Canon customer for years. After spending roughly $100.00 in shipping on 3 separate occasions to send the camera back to Canon's service center, it still is not working properly. In the 8 months I have owned the camera it has only worked properly for a total of 3 days. Everyone at Canon is sympathetic that my camera is not working properly, but no one seems empowered to just ship me one that works. Instead, I have to endure a never ending sequence of shipping and receiving the camera only to find out that they can't seem fix the root cause of why the LCD is not working properly. I find the whole experience with Canon and this product unacceptable. I've been using Canon products since I bought my first A1 almost 20 years ago. I'll never purchase another Canon product, ever."
1,Short Lifespan,"I bought this for my fiance, and while it worked, we were both very happy with the size and quality of pictures. But then the day came, less than a year after buying it, that it decided to stop working. Very frustrating, and it seems like we are not the only ones."
1,E18 error got me,I got the all too common dreaded E18 error after using this camera for 10 months with not so much as a bump to it.I will be sending it in for a warranty repair tomorrow.
4,Darn good camera for me!,"I had a hard time researching digital cameras...there's just too much info out there. I even tried to use the recs from Consumer's Reports, however the things i needed didn't necessarily match what they would rate as high. For example, it was more important for me to have the camera fit in my purse than say for special ergonomic handling.If you're looking for a great camera that gives Better Than Your Friend's Cheap Camera That's Only 2MPX, this is the camera for you lol. Even the CF card is more than enough for a weekend trip of picture taking.The only downfall is the battery situation...you get all of 10 seconds notice when it's about to die. It's easy to plug in and recharge the battery, but i would buy an extra one if you travel alot."
5,A very nice little camera!,I had purchased this camera in 2005 as a replacement for my S400 that was stolen at a car dealership during a test drive session. It is a wonderful little camera and works perfectly to date. Over the years I have bought and sold several other cameras (Fuji F10 etc.) however this one has remained with me and we still use it quite extensively for taking photos at family celebrations and other occasions. A very nice camera indeed!
3,"sees fine, looks gross","I don't take a lot of photos, so I didn't need a lot of fancy features. The Elph works fine for pointing and shooting, then downloading to the computer. I can't upload photos from the computer to the camera.Two downsides: The body began to discolor after my first visit to the seashore. I'm not sure whether it was the salty air or whether the Coach bag ostensibly designed for it is lined with an inappropriate material, but dark splotches have been spreading over the formerly shiny front. At least the camera looks very old now, so maybe it will be less of a target for theft!Also, there is a delay between depressing the shutter release button and the exposure. This is not a problem for still lifes and posed portraits, but if you are a decisive moment photographer, you'd better keep shopping."
1,E18,"I bought my canon digital camera and two days after using it, the E-18 signal appeared. This also happened to my friend. Canon's digital cameras give good quality pictures but are unreliable."
4,"If you want to shoot video, read this!","The S410 is an excellent value, takes beautiful pictures, and is very easy to use. If you want to shoot video though, you need to know that this camera does not allow use of the digital zoom function while it is taking a movie! The lens remains fixed! I was absolutely shocked when I discovered this the second day I owned it, because nothing in the technical data mentions it, and even the S410 Owners Manual has it buried. The video features were one of the prime reasons we purchased this camera instead of another Nikon, and we were disappointed to find it incapable of something our ancient Coolpix 775 could do. We are not happy right now."
3,review,"i think the company i delt with was great - the camera was not my taste, but worked fine and they allowed me to exchange it."
4,fotos en contraluz,"La cámara es excelente y las fotos que toma muy buenas, lo único que no me gustó fue que en el modo de toma de fotos automático, no hay opción en el botón del flash para que este dispare obligatoriamente, lo cual es muy necesario para elementos que estén en contraluz, o como flash de relleno cuando hay muchas sombras............si se quiere hacer esto, hay que pasar al modo manual y hacer ajustes lo que demora mucho la toma de la fotografía........en cámaras de otras marcas, esta opción de flash si está en el modo automático"
5,outstanding item,super fast delivery and item was as described and works perfect i couldn't be happier thanks
1,"These mats are horrible, ugly and smelly....","We purchased these mats and were sadly disappointed. We never got the point of actually using them because the vinyl was so smelly, we couldn't stand to have them in the house. I tried to ""air"" them out in the backyard for days but they still smelled. If you're looking for something to put under your highchair check out the Classy Kid Deluxe Floor & Activity Mat. The Classy kid mat works great and you can throw it in the washer to clean it up like new."
3,Messy Mat-ok,"Was not impressed with the overall quality of the item. It did it's job, but not what I expected. I bought one similar from a different company and that one was machine washable and better quality, but same material...you tell me?"
3,Needs better Mix,The music is very well done and the samples are taken from the better parts of the compositions but the overall mix could have been alittle more even. Example: Tocata in d should have been saved for another cd.
5,Stuck on Gnomes?,"Pay no attention to the ""recommended age"" above - this little booklet of stickers is ageless. Most of the stickers are not so ""sweet"" as Darcy May's fairy drawings, but are comical and charming. I like 'em. Great for sticking on notes to people who take themselves too seriously, as well as for sending to those who simply have a good sense of fun. ...Enjoy!"
5,20 years searching for this one,"Morrison at his best! Only recording you can find of ""Celebration of the Lizard"" which was printed on the ""Waiting for the Sun"" album cover."
4,Break on through,"I bought this LP in the discard pile in 1970. It has been partially rereleased in 1996-7. What else is there to say about Morisson? Many of these cuts have been shown in his Movie by Stone, in rereleased Ed Sullivan on VH1, in Doors videos, live at the Hollywood Bowl etc. I suggest you interpret Morrisson and subdivide his works as the Blues or the Poems. This cd of course falls into the Blues . It was recorded in various states of inebriation which added to the live aspect or the profanity aspect, take your pick. You already know this stuff if you've gotten this far. Nothing real new."
4,The Doors let loose,"Even though it doesn't contain all the hits you'd expect to hear from the Doors like 'Light My Fire' and 'Love me two times', this is still a very good set. The reason being that the Doors are able to display their obvious prowess as a blues band. Blues numbers like 'Who Do You Love?', 'Build me a Woman' and 'Close to You' played with a lot of feeling and that makes these songs very enjoyable, even in the absence of the band's usual hits.We also get to hear fantastic, long versions of showstoppers like 'Five to One' and 'When the Music's over'. The band is on fire and they obviously relish the chance to spread their wings for a while in these long instrumental passages.My only gripe is that Jim's poetry, although it is great, seems to be a bit out of place and takes some of the momentum away from the show.Otherwise, this is a great package and it is quintessential Doors."
4,Showing The Doors at there ultimate fall,Live concerts ranging from 1969-1970 show the Doors falling apart. There singer Jim Morrison as you can often hear on this album is drunk or high and yells and just doesent sound as good. Its a good documentary album showing the Doors falling apart. Its a weird live album and is recommended for those who love live recordings and The Doors.
1,Only because...,"I don't own this CD and chose not to, Only because of the review posted by the man who said to spend a few more dollars and get ""In Concert"" (If you take my advice... make sure it is a double disc and not the condensed single)I agree that ""in Concert"" is a by far better album to buy. You only short yourself by picking this one.Everything said about how wonderful and rare tracks to be heard here are true. The author of that post is right on the money by praising this recording. The only problem is that ""In Concert"" gives you every last bit of this and a little bit more.I love to see concerts but have to admit they tend to fall short of the studio voice. I'm fine with that. Only reason I mention that is because after hearing this album or the other... I feel the studio versions of their music falls short. Either album has to be the best ""Live..feels like you are there"" recordings."
3,Secret HEAVY Stones,I agree wholeheartedly with the H.Klaussner review. This book was intense but I found that I couldn't put it down. The story will draw you in and put you in the midst of the drama. It took me two tries to get going on this book as I was afraid the story would be gruesome and sad but it wasn't at all. The emphasis was placed more on the discovery of the problems within the Caulfield family. It was serious and very definitely a message storyline meant to give courage and insight to victims of abuse and manipulation. If you love a good drama that is well written this should satisfy.
3,Muddy sound despite digital remastering!,"I wanted a CD of Sonny & Cher's greatest hits but was unable to choose between this or the double CD set. Since I was turned off by the many live recordings on disc 2 of the double set, I chose this.Now I am not sure I made the right choice as the sound on this CD is terrible. It sounds like my old cassette tape played on a cassette deck with dirty tape heads. It is so blur.Did I get a defective CD?If you are looking for a CD of Sonny & Cher, please choose the 2 CD set."
1,"Poor choice of ""Greatest Hits""","This was represented as the ""Greatest Hits"" of Sonny & Cher. It is anything but. Poor arrangement of I Got You...as well as choice of songs, etc."
1,Disappointing,"For a ""greatest hits"", this was a major disappointment... it's more a collection of miscellaneous songs, a few hits and some Cher goodies... Better title would have been ""A Couple of Their Greatest Hits and Miscellaneous Stuff"" album..."
4,A great book for pre-teens,"This is a great book. You'll like the book even more if you like future books. It is about a boy who finds this wierd talisman that takes him back in time just as well as the future. So he uses it to see what he's like when he grows up, not knowing how much danger he was in."
5,Great book for all ages,I first read this book when I was in forth grade. It made a great impression on me. During a move a year later the book was lost. I recently found it on auction and read it again. I am amazed at how wonderfully complex the story is for both young and old readers. Certainly a story for all. Happy reading
5,Great time travel book,"I'm a huge fan of time travel books, and this one fits the bill. One of William Sleator's best books. It's fun, and I've read it multiple times."
4,Pleasently surprised,"When Tycho digs up a weird egg-shaped object his life will take an unexpected turn. The egg is a time machine. As he changes his past, he also changes the present and the future for himself and his family. Each time it seems to get worse.I didn't expect very much of this one. Boy was I surprised! This story hooked me from the get-go and I had to read on and see how it all turned out. A nice title. This was the first Sleator book I read but not the last."
1,Didn't capture my heart ..,Does that mean there is something wrong with me .. that I didn't understand how can this be a love stroy .. well .. as much as Francesca and Kincaid tried with me .. I just saw it as a wife cheating on her husband .. in a very bad way ! I didn't see the love .. the love never been given the chance to happen .. to convence me ! Thank you for giving me the space to say what I think !
3,A reminder for those who forgot that true things are simple,"Little ""literary"" value in this book, but great one in terms of human feelings. It is all simple and this is it. All really true things are simple: the two characters, the opportunity, the story, the conclusion. How many of us realy remember that perfect things, in life as in art are simple, unbelievable simple? Those very few of us who do remember will find an old friend in this book."
5,you either love it or hate it,"I suppose it depends on the frame of mind one reads this book it. I am usually averse to romance novels, and the reason I bought book is because this is all the bookshop at the train station had before I boarded my train. However, I was pleasantly surprised - the simplicity of the language and presentation just highlights how close to real life this book is. I loved it - it was a good way to spend two hours alone in a journey."
1,Complete drivel,I only read this book because it was given to me as a gift. Some gift. I heard it took Robert Waller 8 days to write this drivel. That was 7 days too many!
1,"Without a doubt the worst, most inane book I have ever read","This is the only book I have actually thrown across the room when I finished reading it; I only wish I could have graded it with zero stars. The writing was patronizing and the plot was ridiculous. Mr. Waller was apparantly hoping to catch the attention of the Harlequin Romance readers and repressed housewives. If you have not read this book, do youself a favor -- don't!"
4,i am not sure what you'll make of this,"i gifted this book to a woman i loved. i wrote this review with the hope that she might see these lines someday.we dont always get to do what we believe in. and we dont always get to believe in what we do. there are very few instances in our lives when we feel complete. but sometimes, certain circumstances dont allow us to enjoy these instances for too long.sara, if you're reading this, i want you to know that i've been living the life that i've been given but i still wish you were mine and not a day goes by without me wondering about who is ever going to take your place.i dont think anyone can. and i dont think anyone will take francesca's place in the wide open spaces of robert kincaid's heart either."
5,Bridges of Madison County,"I first found this book on a camping trip I took with my dad and step mom. Found it in the top bunk of the camper and took it down and read it while we were driving to leavenworth. I think I was 12 when I picked it up, I thought it was an amazing read and really hooked me. The storyline was great and tragic. This was a read that I carried with me and when I saw the book sitting in a used book store a few months ago I knew I had to have it. I still remember the story well and it is now sitting on my bookshelf with all my favorite reads. Yes, I saw the movie, but I think this book is amazing in it's own right and I can't wait to take it off my shelf and read it again through adult eyes"
3,a tearjerker,"The book overall is fantastic.It is really short though. Mainly I like how it is different from the rest of the typical love story.It has the uniqueness that unifies it from every other book.Endings are what makes a book good or bad.The ending to this book is what made it disappointing to me.The raising action led to a boring climax.Or in other words a climax happend that you did'nt want to happen,which in a way is sort of good.One of the best parts of the book is the characters.They are sort of deserted from everyone else in the book.Which is weird yet thrilling in a way.It is a love story that suprised me out of my boots.The themes are what makes a book complete.Unfortunately the themes are very foggy in the story.Overall the book was good enough to read again."
1,Wish I could give this book a 0,"I can't understand how this book sold millions of copies, I couldn't make myself finish it. It's absolutely the worst book I've ever read."
1,WORST EXCUSE FOR LITERATURE,"A terrible book: pretentious, sappy and just plain ol' poorly written. That this got to be such a sensation tells me only one thing: there are a lot of lonely, sickeningly romantic women out there who don't know crap when they read it. Anyone wonder why this author divorced? I don't."
1,What If The Scenario Were Reversed?,"So many women think this is a wonderful romance novel. Tell me, would you think the same if he had been married, and she had been single? I have posed this question to several women, and they have all said their view would have been different. What a double standard. This one way concept made me hate the book even worse, if that is possible. I read this book to see if it was as bad as the critics said it was (I also watched the movie Plan Nine From Outer Space to see if it was as awful as folks said it was). My conclusion: This book has no literary merit whatsoever. And mind you, I have no objection to romantic novels. Its just that this writer completely lacks talent. This view is vindicated when you note that each future novel by Mr. Waller has sold fewer and fewer copies. It appears that he is now finished with ""writing."" Hallelujah!"
1,"Unbelievably cliched, pretentious, and manipulative","I read this book at the recommendation of a very bright friend. I was skeptical initially because this is not the type of book I would typically read. I wanted to appreciate the book because I trust the judgment and intelligence of the person who recommended it. What I found was a grossly amateurish, intellectually pretentious, and stunningly manipulative piece of drivel. I absolutely hated this book, particularly because of obvious attempts at using emotionally loaded language to appeal to those with Emma Bovary Syndrome - an insistence on believing that somehow infatuation and projection are the ""real"" basis of love between two adult human beings. This is not good thinking, it is not good writing, and it is certainly not good literature. Save your time and your money."
1,eecchhh!,"I admire Mr. Waller's ability to get paid big bucks for this cheese-infested, inane muck. Heck, if he can get published, maybe I have a chance too. The only good thing about BOMC is that it provided hours of entertainment for my classmates who read it out loud and rolled on the floor laughing at the sappy cliched dialogue. I am the arrow and you are my quiver. Ecchh!"
2,I seem to be in the minority with my opinion.,"The story behind The Bridges of Madison County is undoubtedly a beautiful one of true love that comes too late, of loss, of fate. But the book itself was awful. I, personally, do not understand how it became a best seller. The biggest problem was that Robert James Waller has no talent for dialogue. The Bridges of Madison County is full of long monologues by various characters. They are stiff, formal, and unrealistic, not at all the way people hold conversations. The writing style, too, could be improved--it was very simple, very predictable, very unsophisticated. In short, I do not think this book is worth reading. If you're looking for a beautiful love story, try something by Anita Shreve."
2,Not What I Expected!,"I heard and read all the hype on this book. It seemed every one I knew was reading it and just going on and on about ""what a love story""!!! I got to see the movie...it was not bad...but then I only watched it because I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood, ""then"" I read the book!!! Now I wish I had not! It could have been a better story but this one was just dull and on the boring side. I was disappointed in it all the way!"
2,Movie is better,"I got this book after loving the movie with Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, but the book is just too slow."
4,Great!,This story was so touching!! I had seen the movie but the book is more detailed & I loved it!! Made me feel as if I was there.
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I took this book for just what it is...a work of fiction. It's not real, so I didn't feel the need to pass judgement on the characters. It's a story that some will find entertaining, others won't. This book brings to mind an old song that goes something like: it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along. That sums it up in a nutshell. The writing is average, but I couldn't stop reading because I felt sympathy for a couple who fell deeply in love with each other but were doomed from the start. The simple fact is, you can't help who you love. This book explores an emotional (and heartwrenching) journey of what it's like to love someone you can't be with."
5,Very much needed,"This warm, very much needed, intelligent, and caring book is a brilliant study of the human heart and the human condition. It's a story told with such tenderness and depth that it will break your heart. Though not sappy-sweet in sentimentality, it is warm and loving. Just beautiful. Would also like to recommend ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"" and ""Bark of the Dogwood"" as two other excellent reads."
5,Simple & beautiful,"This may be a simple story about simple people, but they are REAL people. If you don't like ""romantic"" feelings in the true, raw sense then this book may appeal less, but if you believe in the power of simple love; there is nothing better. I was crying when I read the ""afterword"" by the photographer's friend musician."
2,Rarely do I say this but....,"Watch The Movie instead. I must say though that I really appreciated this book when I was younger and more starry-eyed. I love the premise, though I feel the writing could have been more lush and poetic.The movie is more heartbreaking."
1,Puts happy face on physical and emotional adultry,This book reminds me of working with therapy clients who have cheated on their spouses. They attempt to describe why their relationship was so wonderful. The author also shows some guilt by writting about how the children respond positively. It is very rare for children to hear about one of their parents committing adultry and liking the fact!
3,work ethic,"A lesson of this book is not just that crap sells, but that hard work is not always rewarded. Tom Wolfe (a brilliant writer) has been working on his follow up novel to BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES for over 10 years. His new novel will probably sell well...but BRIDGES was written by Waller in TWO WEEKS, and it is THE BEST SELLING HARD COVER NOVEL IN HISTORY!! Two weeks of effort earned Waller tens of millions of dollars. (Justice comes when Waller-like crap goes out of print quick, whereas Wolfe's writing will be read long after he is dead)."
4,True Love comes only once in a life time.,"This is one of the most interesting love story I ever read. The book is easy to understand because the author has written it in a very easy form of language. It is clear and sounds real that makes you truly experiencing the feelings of the two characters have. The love atomsphere is so strong that makes me wondering it's the feeling true when you do fell in love with the perfect one? This story contains a sentimental quote that states an important point. You may want to take some time to think about this quote if you are a romantic person. ""In a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once, and never again, no matter how many lift time you live."" p117 Robert Kincaid"
5,BOMC: A true romance novel!,"Why must the story be realistic? Why must the writing be creative? What does it matter if there are cliches? If you want realism, watch the news channel, if you want creative, read Dickens, Austin, Bronte.. BOMC is a romance, repeat a ROMANCE!!! Read all the 5-star reviews and find out what being in love is really all about!"
1,What A Joke,"Are these posters giving this book a 10 for real? This book (and I hesitate to call it that), is UNBEARABLE...."
1,Drivel,"This book is like a Harlequin Romance written by an untalented imitator of Kahlil Gibran. Overblown and trite. Hard to believe a book this short can be too long, but it is. It plays into the worst stereotypes of passive woman/active man. A prime contender for my all-time ""worst book"" list"
3,It's not so bad. . .,"So it's not Tolstoy. The writing is a bit stilted, butif you are in the mood for a sweet tearjerker which willmake you believe in love after the age of 40, this is the book for you. A quick read too, for you impatient types"
1,See Movie...Skip Book!,The Clint Eastwood movie was 500% better than the book. I so respect Mr. Eastwood as a filmmaker because he had the brilliant idea to cast Meryl Streep and to make the movie about Francesca. Lovely!
4,A simple love story for the romantic sap in all of us,"I enjoy reading all the criticisms of these people who read these books and thrash the author. I have one question: what have you published recently?I enjoyed reading Bridges for the fact it was simple. It is such a common theme, yet Waller's presentation is unique with the relationship development. Maybe Waller isn't Pulitzer material, but he wrote a nice book about the tests of love, priorities, and committment. Thanks, Waller, for writing a book that left me with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes."
1,Not worth wasting time over.,"I sincerely hope that teenagers who have read this book have not been caught in a fantasy of undying romantic love. It's a nice enough story, but written in a trite overly-poetic manner. Gosh! Who speaks crap like ""I am like a Peregrine...etc."" And funny how Francesa gets over her guilt very fast. She is supposed to be a deep and sensitive person isn't she? Very few persons in their sane minds woud leave a legacy for their children detailing their extra-marital affairs. Robert Kincaid the macho man gets a chain bearing the name ""Francesa"" and pines for her till his death????? How much more unrealistic can you get? The only plus point is the description of the country that is vivid, you can picture locales very easily in your mind's-eye. This book is strictly for the ""Use and throw"" kind - like killing time on a short plane trip and the like."
3,For Lovers Only,"I read bridges Of Madison County after seeing the movie. Perhaps that was my mistake. Sentimentality being one thing, love stories being another, I found the main character Robert Kincaid one dimensional. There is the foundation for a great book here, but Waller seems to run out of concrete about half way through leaving readers with just a nice love story.BJ Neblett [...]"
3,"Not bad, but not good","The Bridges of Madison County is not the type of novel that makes you go to sleep from it's boringness, but it's not all too well, either. It's just those type of novels that you don't know what to say about 'em. Whether it was good or bad, whether it was boring or not, and most important of all, whether it's worth spending your money on. I wouldn't. When I first read this novel was one year ago when I was 12. Now I'm 13 and stopped reading Mr. Waller, I just didn't think I should spend my money on authors like Waller when there is much better authors such as Tom Clancy, John Grisham, and Stephen King. If those authors don't do it for you, just look at books that won The Pulitzer Prize or The National Book Award. I believe that The Bridges of Madison County was in Oprah's book club, I'm not sure, but if it was, it's credible."
5,"Most romantic, caring, unselfish book that you'll ever read.",Robert James Waller writes so good in this book it isunbelievable. The love of Robert and Francesca makes you wish you could have been them. This story makes an affair almost seem right but so wrong at the same time. A word to the wise be aware this book WILL make you cry. It is the most touching book out there you haven't read anything until you have read this love story. You will read this book over and over.
1,I HAD TO LAUGH...,"when I read the review from Dave in the Great Midwest because IAGREE THOROUGHLY! I, too, read this book in an afternoon on the advice of a friend and I, too, was apalled. The characters ARE both quite pathetic. And since when did adultry get to be so romantic? The premise is stupid and the dialogue is atrocious. The male character could well be an escapee from a mental hospital, he says such bombastically, nonsensical things! I think the popularity of this book and the subsequent movie just go to show that if you TELL people something is good, most will believe it."
4,Waller's novel touches the soul.,"THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is one of those haunting novelslike Fournier's THE WANDERER or McBride's THE CLEARING. It gives you hope, it rekindles those embers within the heart that have a lmost gone cold. If you know or liked THE WANDERER or THE CLEARING, you'll love THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY."
4,I WAS HOOKED,"Unabashedly sentimental and easily moved, I am one of the manymany people swept up in the simple love story in this book. Robert James Waller definitely hit a soapy nerve; people are still gobbling up this simplistic kids-book-for-adults. And, easy read though it is, with little real wit or style, the essential story, which some claim is predictable, still resonated deeply for me at the conclusion. Unrequited love is a mighty powerful conceit, regardless of how many times it is replayed. And the characters, though underdeveloped, are well-imagined, and have appealing qualities, particularly Francesca, who exudes a soft melancholy throughout. Mish, mash, mush, whatever, if you like love stories that take you away, albeit manipulate you, with transporting sentimentality, you'll curl up with this book more than once, and enjoy it every time."
1,Betrayal in Madison County,"Reading so many other disparaging reviews about Bridges has renewed my faith in humanity. This is the worst book I have ever read - far worse than any Harlequin romance, because they are never hailed as a profound or beuatiful works of literature. I have to worry about anyone who sympathises with Francesca and their propensity for cheating on a faithful, kind, spouse. If you are bored, don't have a cheap and nasty affair with a womanising loser - find ways of bringing life back into your marriage. And as far as the writing style is concerned - well it certainly spiced up my marriage - my husband and I had many moments of closeness laughing hysterically at this romantic drivel."
5,Perfect read for the sentimentalist,"A woman I know, along with an Amazon.com reviewer or two, couldn't comprehend how Francesca's boredom could lead her to betray her husband. Francesca was not bored, perhaps unsustained by her husband's lack of passion, but not bored. Bridges of Madison County hit the bestsellers list for years because just about everyone has parted ways with someone they loved, whether it lasted four days or ten years. True passion lives forever in the memory and can sustain for a lifetime. This story is beautiful, one of my favorites."
1,A fact that escapes many of you...,"...is that Waller's day job is a professor of marketing. Doesn't that just say it all? Upon finishing this book, I thought, ""Who wrote this? A committee in conjunction with a focus group?"" Then I read Waller's bio on the back cover. Yup, I was right. This book is nothing but a horny professor's wet dream. I mean, come on, what's with the line about being a peregrine? If some guy showed up in my front yard and said that, I'd direct him to the local police department. If you want romance, try marrying someone you REALLY love. Passion and tenderness do exist within legitimate relationships. Now THAT'S a storyline!"
1,Misery,"This book is so bad, so horrible, so nauseating and phoney that it's amazing. Sure, I could go on about how it lacks originality, lacks descriptive power, how the thoughts are all trite and childish, and even how a nice story can be ruined for all time. But I won't. Instead, let's play a game where we all pick out the absolutely worst sentence. Mine: ""And out of the pickup came Rober Kincaid, looking like some vision from a never-written book called An Illustrated History of Shamans."" Is there a more nonsensical way to describe the first appearance of someone to someone else in a novel? I've never seen it."
1,Hilarious!,"If you want to have a good laugh, please read this book. It was so incredibly bad that it is a parody of itself. The author/main character is so conceited and narcissistic (One scene that cracked me up was when a gorgeous model sniffs that basically she can't get close to him because he is too deep, brooding - HELLO! Can this be anymore silly? Talk about a male fantasy!) I believe a parody of this was written called ""The Ditches of Edison County"" but there really isn't any need to read that because you'll laugh just as much reading this rubbish."
1,"Let's get real, this book is awful.....","I have to say honestly, I saw the movie before I read the book, and I liked the movie a lot! I love Meryl Streep, but Clint Eastwood gives me the heebie jeebies....so needless to say, as I'm reading the book (after I saw the movie) and the author is writing about how Robert Kincaid is supposed to be this sexy older man, I'm trying to keep my lunch down! Yuck. I'm sorry but the image of Clint Eastwood ruined it for me...it was horrible enough watching him kiss and make love to Francesca in the movie...they totally should have has someone like...I don't know...Robert Redford play the part of Robert Kincaid....Clint Eastwood needs to stick to the Dirty Harry movies....not love stories....this book might have had potential, but I just can't get that old man out of my mind."
1,Yeccchhhh!,"I must thank Robert James Waller as I now have a new litmus test for dating women. I will, from now on, refuse to date anyone who liked or cried when reading this book (unless they were tears for how badly written and narcissistic it is).Utter Trash!"
1,"Moving, indeed.","Actually, it's not simply that it's bad.Bad we can cope with. What's really, really horrific is the way people rave about it, as though it were the lost fifth Gospel.When I was ""invited"" by my Lady Fair to see the movie with her, I innoculated myself with a heartening tot or two (well, alright. Three.) of Bell's 8 year old. I survived the movie, but only just. I was a weakened, shambling shell of a man for a week or two afterwards, but no permanent harm was done.Then I was ""asked"" (once again by the Lady Fair)to read the book and report my thoughts. We are still together, but it was touch and go for a while.Imagine a block of super-concentrated caramel. It weighs, say, 8 ounces. Melt it gently in a pot, add three more pounds of sugar, and a healthy handful of saccharine.Allow to set, and call it ""The Bridges of Madison County"".Oh, the horror. The horror."
1,"If this is love, I'm taking the veil","I have over two thousand books and this is the only book Ihave ever bought that I could not read. It was so sappy and stupid, it should be sold with a supply of Dramamine. If the author is reading this--please refund my eighteen dollars. I am fearful for a generation of women who feel that this book is the pinnacle of romance."
1,All the deep emotion and refined sensibility of Liberace,"... and that's an insult to Liberace, whose maudlin treacle was at least technically competent. _Bridges_ is a stupendous failure on every conceivable level and probably some inconceivable ones. Its only redeeming value is its unintentional hilarity; otherwise, it's a sugar-frosted turd."
1,Read this instead:,"The Ditches of Edison County. If you hated ""Bridges"" as much as I did, this version will be extremely rewarding; if you happen to fall into that set of readers who liked the original, who knows--you might learn why you shouldn't."
2,Tearful but trivial,"Reactions to this book are likely to be strongly polarized; some people will love it and others hate it. It is a simple story of tragic love, with no profound insights or surprising twists. The story itself is genuinely moving, and I am not ashamed to admit to shedding a tear or two. But Waller's writing style is very poor, full of cliches, and with embarrassingly clumsy attempts at lyricism. If you want to know what a real writer can do with such a theme, read Edith Wharton's 'Ethan Frome'.'Bridges' is a short story padded out to make a novella, using interminable details about loading a truck and taking a photograph. 'Set lens to f/8' we are told. Fascinating stuff, which must have made for a great movie. It is incredible to think that Waller actually squeezed a sequel out of it. I will not be reading that."
3,"what we all need, what none of us need.","This book, in my mind, showed a love dreamed of by most, but attianed by few. Is it not fitting that this book became such a hit in a time such as this. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added years to life, not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor. In a time such as this, a book comes along with a dishonest house wife, and people still marvel in this wonderful story of hideous morals. One can only ask why did this book stay on or near the top of the best sellers list for 3 years like it did? I'm curious what you think, please respond and write a review of your own. I think this has to do with it now being socially accepted for wives and husband to not respect the vows of marriage, if. if. if it is true love they have found."
1,"If there's a worse book in the world, I haven't read it","A truly wretched book that reduces romance to a jumble of poorly-written cliches. The writing is so astoundingly awful that it is often quite funny, sounding like a prizewinning entry in one of those Bad Writing contests. The unintentional hilarity is the book's only asset; otherwise, it's a sugar-frosted turd.If you enjoy reading Harlequin Romances while listening to ""You Light Up My Life"" played on a Hammond organ, then ""Bridges"" might be for you. On the other hand, if you've ever found pleasure in a book written by a competent author, approach ""Bridges"" in the same way you'd watch ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."""
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This book was as boring as the film was,but yet i HAD to read it,no thanks! I really dont know what all tho commotion was all about when this came on the market.alterego from Tulsa OK"
3,Disappointment after the movie,"I quite enjoyed the movie - so the book can't be all bad! Nevertheless I found it to have a distinct phoney quality - starting with the author's photograph! The story is fine, but the way it was written makes me feel as if it was written by an advertising agency."
4,Too much exageration from both sides.,"I read this book before all the hoopla began. It was recommended as a good book and a quick read. I found it to be just that. I, however, liked the book more than my friend did since I am a true sap. The point is, yes it was a very good book. But only for those who can lose themselves completely to a character. I also feel it is necessary to point out that any time a book becomes a movie and there are TOP actors performing. The media frenzy has more to do with paying required salaries than with actual quality of the story. Everyone out there who was so bitingly disappointed needs to realize it is necessary to take ""the promotional hype"" with a grain of salt. That's all it ever is in the end."
1,I've Just Got to Get This Out of My System...,"The is the pitiful story of a self absorbed, anti-social National Geographic photographer and his fling with a rural-living Italian woman who apparently doesn't get out much. Yuck! What garbage. The photographer is obviously Waller's ""fantasy self."" All I kept thinking when I read about his incredible prowess was, ""You wish, Buddy."" The good news is, this means that just about anybody can get published!!!"
2,"Not a ""pleasant little love story""","I have never seen the movie, but I don't think I will. As a romance novel fan, this was not really my cup of tea. To me, ""a pleasant little love story"" has a happy ending, and doesn't involve denying your feelings for fifteen years. Anyway, it reminded me way too much of The Notebook, which I hated, so I'll be passing this one along with a less than stellar recommendation. If you have a love for the tragic, this one's for you."
1,Mills & Boon,Junk. I read this book on the recommnedationm of someone whose taste I questioned. Having struggled to finish this Mills & Boon type romantic tripe I vowed never to listen to that person again. This book is just dreadful - the macho male and fawning female actually annoyed me. A shocker and a waste of time.
1,Please do not read this book,"I had to read this book in school. After the first chapter I could tell that I would not enjoy this novel. The characters were not realistic. This was especially true of Francesca's children who seemed totally ok with the fact that Francesca cheated on her husband. Some people say that they were moved by this novel, I was not. All the pseudo-romantic babble (Cowboy, Falcon) made me feel ill. Not because it failed to move me, but because some people actually like it and think that this is good stuff."
1,Nugatory!,"I'm an older woman, and hopelessly romantic. I found this book so badly written, so utterly nugatory, that its bestseller status makes me worry about the future of the human race."
1,My God,"This is probably the most hysterically funny book I've ever read. I didn't actually finish it (I mean, come ON . . .) but for an entire summer my friends and I would make each other laugh until we cried by reading some of Waller's truly miserable prose. I thank Mr. Waller for providing for so much unintentional hilarity and I very much pity anyone who actually forced themselves to finish what is truly an awful, insultingly bad book."
1,Sigh,"This book made me feel icky all over. There are certain fantasies that it's just smarter to keep private. This is one of them. I'm not sure what made me more uncomfortable, the lovers (argh, what a cliche) or the creeping sensation that it was all a big marketing ploy. Definitely not for anyone who is looking for something more than a stereotypical romance novel dressed as literature."
1,"If this is love, I'm taking the veil","I have over two thousand books and this is the only book I have ever bought that I could not read. It was so sappy and stupid, it should be sold with a supply of Dramamine. If the author is reading this--please refund my eighteen dollars. I am fearful for a generation of women who feel that this book is the pinnacle of romance."
1,Not credible.,"I just couldn't bring myself to feel sympathy for this woman who on a whim decided to cheat. She wasn't abused, neglected, ignored or any of the other reasons a person might be expected to experience before looking for an affair. She was just plain ole bored. Nothing worth wasting sympathy on. Can't believe these two people who only saw each other for a brief period could carry the torch the rest of their lives. The children reading the story and thinking that it was just wonderful without feeling even a little sorry for their father doesn't ring true. Sorry..can't recommend."
1,In his dreams!,"Thank God I'm selective when it comes to my own cash. This book was lent to me by a 35+ y.o. single friend that said she cried and cried. I was really reluctant to read it but did after some prodding. Oh, gag me. A slob with a filthy trashed-out truck and dirty jeans just wouldn't do it for me. Not even on a whim. No substance to the story just another air-head woman forgetting about what's important in life."
1,"""A Crime Against Literature""","I quote the great Meryl Streep by calling this book a crime against literature. I wish there were negative stars that I can give this awful concoction of pointless romanticism and inept story structure. The plot was minimal, the characterizations were nonexistent. For the life of me, I can't understand why this book was so popular. You have to give Mr. Waller credit for marketing. He knew what would sell, and apparently he spent all of an afternoon producing it. Now please, stop the madness and don't produce any more books like this one."
1,This book is not recomended by any means!!,"First it starts out, descriptive and semi-interesting, butthat's about where the good qualities end. I thought that maybe the book just had a bad couple pages. As I continued to read, I noticed that the few pages turned into a chapter or two. I realized that the book was horrable and that if I hadn't had to read it for a grade in my L.A. class, then I would have put it down, or should I say thrown it out long ago. Thank you very much and I hope that I saved a ton of your time by warning you about how boring this book REALLY was..."
3,Love after 40,"A married woman comes across a photographer in his fifties and lives a second chance in love. The story is nice and easy to read, in fact, the book finishes sooner that you could have imagined but, after reading the end, you'll realize there wasn't much more to say."
2,"Interesting, but overrated love story","This brief book (took me about three hours to finish) has its high points but at other times wallows in unrealistic dialogue and unlikely characterizations.Robert Kincaid is a well-rounded character, but Francesca -- an Italian immigrant turned English literature teacher (!) -- misses the mark after a decent start. Particularly disappointing were the dialogue between Robert and herself, discussing their future, which reads like the author talking with himself; as well as the letter to her children at the end of the book, which sounds as if it were written to two strangers."
5,THE BESTEST LOVE STORY EVER WRITTEN!!!,"I love the book, in fact reread it 3 times and it never failed to touch me deeply. I just wonder how readers could give it a 1 to 4 or even 7 book rating when the author incorported lots of deep and meaningful language, colorful comparizons.. i.e. Peregrine. For me it is a ""10"" ten times over. I specially love the scene where Francesca was in the car with her husband and watching Robert Kincaid drive away....I cried my heart out on that scene. This book will stay with me forever!!!!"
5,If you've ever loved the right person at the wrong time...,"this is your story. Waller reaches through the heart and into the soul of anyone who has truly loved to the depths of human capacity. This book puts into words the bittersweet wrenching emotion of finding your soulmate and finding your joining impossible. There is depth and understanding here that is incomprehensible to anyone who has never been where Robert and Francesca go. If you've been there, Waller has put into words everything you felt and to this day may not be able to relate to another who doesn't understand."
2,"See the movie, skip the book.","The movie captures the magic of falling in love with its quiet moments, yearning music and, above all, Meryl Streep's fabulous performance as Francesca. The book, which I read after seeing the film, was a great disappointment. I agree with most of the negative comments on this page. The fact the story itself has attracted such vehemently opposing views, however, does show that Waller's story has touched a nerve with the public. It shows perhaps that love and hate are two sides of the same coin."
1,Burn BEFORE reading!,"Painful prose. I heard the author wrote this either tongue-in-cheek (which shows) or, after repeatedly failing to get published, decided to resort to writing a romance novel with contempt. As I suffered thru it I pictured him writing it figuring, ""If this is what the public wants, dammit, I can spew this drivel like the best of them."" I also recall hearing it took him only a few days to churn it out. Shame on him."
3,don't be so harsh,"Wow, I tend to agree with the other reviewer that people who are so extreamly harsh with their reviews must be terribly miserable people with perhaps, seriously unhappy lives, void of satisfying love or the ability to feel romance.I am a reader of non-fiction history and never read a romance novel so I do not know anything about their content, but I chose to read this book after seeing the movie and found it a bit ""poetic"", but refreshing and I certainly didn't have the need to ""throw it against the wall"". Wow, what a reaction!Sometimes you need a ""walk down the lane of love"" that apparently, few people never experience. Yes, middle age passion can happen, whether it does as passiontly as in this book, who knows. But it is a refreshing to read. So, lighten up and make a date with romance and enjoy the book for what it is. The sequel is an interesting trip too, a bit over-kill, but interesting."
4,Sad,"This is a book you either love or hate! There's no inbetween. It's a beautiful love story about a short affair between a stranger and a lonely married Italian woman who fines herself alone while her family attend a fair. The stranger stops for directions and from that moment, a whirlwind love affair occurs. Don't be fooled by the title into thinking the book is a detailed description of our countries bridges. The stranger who is a photographer, is taking photographs of local bridges for a magazine which is why he's in the area and thus the title of the book. I'm not usually one for sloppy romance novels but in this case, I found this book to be a caring and loving account of two people in deep love and having to part company. It's very sad. I recommend it. It's much better than the movie of the same name."
5,Top 10 Love Stories of All Time,"If you find adultery offensive, don't read this book. If you like Cinderella fairy tales, this is not for you. If you are looking for intellectual discussions, don't waste your time. But if you want to experience the joy and intensity of true love between two people, you have to read this book! I have tasted such love once and this book describes many similar feelings (and even words) I experienced. Tired of Hollywood's frequent portrayal of men who seem to be only interested in ""scoring"" women, I applaud Waller's effort in depicting another kind of masculinity, rare but real, who has a genuine desire to find and cultivate the kindred spirit in his life. Whether you are a man or woman, in love or out of love, you will find this uplifting story touch your soul and giving you hope."
1,BORING!,This book was a best-seller? I had to read it twice to make sure it was as bad as I thought it was the first time!
1,Over-rated drivel,"This waste of time gets no rating whatsoever from me. (However, I had to select a rating from the list; too bad ZERO stars hadn't been an option.) I find it hard to believe ANYONE could like this book. Those people who did like it apparently are from the trashy-love-novel fan club. An absolutely awful book..."
1,Ugh!,"I guess we could all spend a little time wondering ""what if"", but as far as this book goes - get real! We are to believe a farm wife just falls hopelessly in love with someone driving into her lane. I don't think so! I gave this book to my friend who is a generation older than me (mid-60's) who was a farm wife in central Iowa. I warned her it was sappy and stupid. She called, crying, asking if she could keep the book - it was SO wonderful. So, go figure."
1,desperate housewives prequel,"I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read. The whole plot is just plain ridiculous. Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime. When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years. Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is? Avoid this one."
2,Is this really true?,"I could easily spend four days with a woman like Francesca. To base my life on this short affair just is not plausible. Men think differently than women do, it is our nature. Our attitudes are needed for survival in dangerous positions, and survival of the species."
3,"FUN & QUICK, BUT NOT THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL","Robert Kinkaid stops and asks directions of Francesca Johnson while photographing covered bridges in Madison County, Iowa. Its love at first sight.Most people know this story by now. What is interesting is the self-serving way Waller writes himself into the fantasy, so thinly desguised. I mean really, he names his principal character Robert? You would think he was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Though the book tries to be noble, with Robert staying away and Francesca sticking with her responsibilities to her family, Francesca is still an aldulterous whore no matter how you slice it.An interesting book to while away an afternoon."
1,Felt ripped off by author...time to vent!!,"I read this book many years ago, right after came out...was excited to read a book so many raved about and in my many years of reading novels, this is the first I ever stopped reading because I was disgusted by what felt like a manipulation by author to capture the fancy of women who dreamed of having a romantic affair.....so I gave to a woman who actually lived out this fantasy (very sordid & destructive to a whole family) and she thought it was a wonderful book!! Go figure!!"
1,Over-rated - I'm sorry I spent the time and the money on it.,"This book was hardly the compelling story it was cracked up to be. In fact, one wonders whether it would have done so well without Oprah's endorsement of it. Because of her endorsement, I view with skepticism any other books she has endorsed, and her endorsement is never a reason I would read a book."
1,Unreadable,"As in, I could not read this book. I got through the first chapter and had to stop. It wasn't just bad - it actually HURT me - almost physically, certainly mentally. I think that Amazon.com, as a philanthropic enterprise, should send every customer who rated this novel a 10 one good book. Not a great one - these people are not ready for, say, Anna Karenina - just a good one, with at least one of the following virtues ""Bridges"" conspicuously lacks: 1) Sentences.2) Human speech.3) A moral centeror, lacking those,4) Pictures"
1,Remember Waller's Book Signings?,"Saw stories about the audiences at his book signings around the country when the book came out. By and large the audiences were made up of women in the 40-55 years old age range--precisely the Harlequin Romancers of the world who were probably in deadend marriages and yearned for the escapist fantasy Waller provided. But as a novel? Full disclosure: I never got past page 16. Couldn't do it. The writing was that bad. Just horrible cliches, awkward phrasing. And I must say how hilarious to read others defending their uplifting experience with bad literature with ""If you didn't like it, you must never have been in love!""Oh honey, yes we have. And are. We just don't want to waste our time reading bad writing. Whatever the story..."
1,TERRIBLE.,"Everyone in my family read this book. We kept passing it to one another with the intro, ""you have to read this. It's TERRIBLE."" Because we really wanted someone else in the house with whom we could discuss who TERRIBLE it was. And once we all read it, we spent many enjoyable meals talking about how much we hated it. So at least it fostered family unity. But the movie is much much better -- how often can you say that?"
1,I'm insulted. So is the rest of Iowa.,"In a writing workshop I attended, 'Waller' was synonymous with 'whore.' No one in Iowa who reads or has a brain will forgive him for this book. I just want to refute a couple of Waller's ideas.1. Iowa is heavily religious, and adultery is a sin. It would have been worse than murder in '65, and 'Francesca' would never have been forgiven.2. In Iowa, people can write. Our schools are among the nation's best. The Writer's Workshops at the University of Iowa are world-renowned, just ask Vonnegut or Irving. Meredith Willson, from Mason City, wrote a musical, ""The Music Man,"" that's still on Broadway.But Waller isn't from Iowa. He doesn't belong here. And damned if we'll let him speak for us again."
1,What a disappointment!,"Not the worst book I've ever read, but certainly one of the most disappointing! I'm crazy about a good love story, but this one wasn't it! I thought the book looked great, people had told me it was a great love story, I was set for a good read. What a let down! It wasn't particularly well written and the story was silly, yet took itself so seriously. To take a trite little story and treat it like it was the most profound thing since Socrates-- PLEASE! (One thing in its favor-- at least it was short!"
1,See the movie instead,"Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot!"
1,What is all the hype about?,"I read this book because I was tired of seeing it all over the place and assumed that there was something there. I closed it 2 hours later, having finished it in that amount of time, wondering how many poor trees had to die to print this soap opera. Children find out that their mother had an extra-marital affair on their father while they were at a country fair, having left her behind to pick up a wandering photojournalist and they find the romance worthy of celebrating? Yeah! That is reality for you. I am sure there are loads of adult children hoping they found out that their mother was living a lie their entire lives!Sorry, but I still regret wasting the time on this book. And I won't see the movie, even on video, because I have already wasted enough time on this sentimental fantasy. I would rather read a Harlequin novel. At least then I would have been forewarned and without excuse for wasting my time."
1,unintentionally hilarious,"This book is SO over the top I found myself anticipating the next breathless passage with actual excitement. It also provides another exception to the cliche that ""the book is always superior to the movie""---the Eastwood movie is actually a nice little bittersweet romance----if you want a love story see the movie---if you want a laugh read the book!"
1,unhappy customer,"Unit unreliable, corrupted data after only a month of use...Volume Header errors regularly...Support non-existent, hopeless, non-responsive, unable to issue return authorisation, been waiting months...Drives noisy, two fans coming on and off, enough to disturb your sleep with the occasional rattle...Minimal software, need to buy TechToolPro (MAC) to do diagnostics. My last LaCie Product!."
1,steer clear of this unit!,"I had gotten tired of using a 250GB external and decided to step up to the mack daddy and assume i wouldn't have to buy another external for five years. well, now after a little under a month of using this unit, it isn't recognized by any of my PCs. I've tried all of the recommended tweaks to get it back but now, i need to find a data reovery specialist and deal w/ Lacie's horrendous support. you would think when you drop a decent amount of change on something that the thing would at least make it a year before implosion. apparently other units have a decent track record but not this one. beyond disgusted..."
1,Bad product,The Lacie 1.2T extreme was purchased to provide offline access to a about 400gig of files from a file server. There are massive delays in browsing the directories even via a cli interface. I've never experiances such a slow access time on an external hard drive as this product. It maybe good if you have a small number of large files but the seek times make this worthless for large numbers of small files.Also note the USB interface is turned off if a firewire cable is plugged in. It would of been nice for letting two machines access at once... but no luck with this. It is for single user only.
5,Excellent CD.,Every song is great and worshipful. I would highly recommend this album for anyone going through a trial or who just loves to worship.
5,Nutritious & Delicious,"I am under a very restrictive diet for health circumstances. This crackers are the only ones I can eat. They are natural, organic, don't trigger any alergic reaction, and on top of that, they are really delicious. My husband, who is completely healthy, also love them and he'd rather have this crackers than any other brand or kind. We'll give them 2 thumbs up."
4,First hand account of the Lincoln Conspiracy,"I have only begun this book about the Lincoln Conspirators, however, I can say that it is the most accessible work on the subject matter and a pleasure to read.I don't believe I have read anything quite like it in the past and certainly not about the Lincoln assassination. All the other works on the subject have beenheavy handed and far too institutional to actually finish. The book is out of print, but easy to find. If you are at all interested in the who, when and where,by all means, read this book."
3,Crazy Journey,"While i could appreciate the message, this book seemed more geared toward self-help, and only thinly disguised as fiction. A worthwhile resource none the less. Perhaps it is mislabeled as fiction and would fare better under the self help or spiritual section. Not exactly what i was looking for, but it will be passed on to those who can use its message."
3,"Good wire, but was sent wrong amount twice!","The wire seems to be pretty good, and so is the insulation. Also, the wires are easily split without exposing the wire.***BEWARE: You may only receive half of the length that you are ordering***I'm not sure if it is the fault of Coleman Cable or Amazon (I guess Amazon because they are fulfilling the order), but I ordered the 22 AWG 1000 foot spool and was sent a 500 foot spool. After *several* frustrating phone calls to Amazon I got them to send me another spool. I was supposed to return the original, but I waited until the second arrived to make sure that it was correct. Of course, it wasn't. I was given another 500 foot spool. I called Amazon again, and asked if I could just keep both instead of trying for another spool. They agreed to this, so I ended up getting two 500 foot spools instead of one 1000 foot spool. Fortunately, I am planning to split them in to 50 foot lengths so I didn't need one solid spool."
2,was sent two 250ft spools,"I was sent two 250ft spools, i wanted one 500ft spool, I also wanted same as picture it is not a metal spool it is plastic and not made by coleman a good quality brand of wire, if you purchase this item don't purchase from deerso inc. ""boo on them""."
3,RhondaMT,"I wasn't really impressed with this CD. But it could be just because my 2 1/2 year old son was to advanced for this CD. Even though his can't read, he is very knowlegeable on the computer. These learning games were to simple for him, so he got bored really fast."
2,POOR QUALITY,"BEING AN OLD LEE MOORE FAN WHO LISTENED TO HIM ON THE RADIO MANY YEARS AGO, I WAS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE TECHNICAL QUALITY OF THIS RECORDING. THE FIDELITY WAS AS A POOR AM RADIO QUALITY AND AN AWFUL REVERB/ECHO EFFECT WAS USED WHICH MADE IT SOUND AS IF THE ARTIST WAS SINGING FROM INSIDE A BARREL WITH THE MICROPHONE OUTSIDE. DON'T BUY IT."
5,gaither homecoming series,I love the quality of music by the different singer's. I wish I could say that one of them is my favorite but I enjoy them all. I highly recommend this cd and dvd to anyone who love's the Gaither musician's.
1,utter garbage,"you will get what you pay for! compare this to a 30 or 100 dollar hdmi and you will see the difference. I have a 46"" 120hz LCD Samsung and the picture was incredibly snowy and fuzzy with this junk out of china. Beware. Not worth the 3 dollars on your new prized electronics."
5,Good,"The cable works, which is more than can be said of some other companies selling their HDMI cables on this site."
1,Junk,I tried to use these with an Onkyo 3400 receiver and epson 8350 and all I got was snowy picture. I bought two cables and both of them had the same results. Don't waste your money if you have the same setup as me.
5,It's cheap and it works . . .,Anyone that spends more than $10 for a basic HDMI cable is cheating themselves. There is no magic in the names brands other than the printing on the cable. Every cheap cable I have bought has worked just fine . . . and I have some very demanding equipment.
1,Chicago Joe and The Showgirl,This movie is really bad. I love all Kiefer Sutherland movies except this one. It was a very poor production.
1,WHAT'S UP?????,"Ok we all know that Sealab 2020 is a CLASSIC 1972 cartoon. So where in the HELL is the DVD for the complete series? A CLASSIC like Sealab has NO DVD? COME ON PEOPLE!!! Give us the DVD, PLEASE!!!"
4,The Lessons,The book was well written. The plot moves smoothly and the characters are well thought out. The seem and act like they should and you can get cought up in the whole search. I would recommend this to book to anyone who likes detective type stories.
3,Good idea,"A great idea and I would recommend it. However, it would be nice if the cigars were a little bigger and more cigar shaped. Overall though good idea and good product."
1,I really wanted to like this book but...,"It was tedious. I was hoping that the story would get interesting at some point, there might be some sort of passion or driving force but the characters just got swept along. There was nothing to make me care about any of the characters; they were all generic, taken from ""central casting"". The book was violent and ugly without a strong moral center. It was truly a struggle to finish."
1,An alternate reality?!,"Not only does Morgan see the US Colonial world of 1780 as one full of violence, but he also has a Christmas tree and British soldiers using the word ""padre"" when they talk to the priest in the story. Morgan needs to check his facts. Also, the priest is a unbelievable character. He is supposed to be noble and virtuous, but then he seduces his friend Joseph (who is really Josie), with very little thought to the consequences. I couldn't make myself finish the story."
2,I loved Gap Creek but this is a poor follow on effort,"I greatly enjoyed Gap Creek, Morgan's novel about the difficult life of a 17 year old girl who lived 100 years ago but Brave Enemies, the story of a 16 year old girl (who pretends to be be a boy to protect herself) who lived 225 years ago falls flat for me. Josie/Joseph is just too saintly to believe while the preacher who takes in Joseph (only to discover a woman under the rags) seems to have real psychological problems. Their relationship doesn't seem real.The book has too many examples of unrealistic coincidences and miraculous escapes. I did enjoy Morgan's portrayal of day to day life in the Carolinas but I can't recommend the book."
3,Good -Not Great,"There's a lot to like in this book, but some to dislike too. The description of life in the 1770's South, and of the battles themselves are excellent. But the basic plot of the book never seems to hit home. There are too many coincidences and too many purely good v. purely evil characterizations. Also, the relationship between the two main characters seems forced. While I usually like creativity, a more conventional plot line would have been a better idea as it wouldn't have gotten in the way of the excellent background writing."
5,A great readed,"I just picked this book out as one of the books I was going to read on vaction. The problem is that it never made withme on my trip to the Gulf. I finished the book in two days. Because I could not put it down. I am not one who would read a love story. I got the book because of the Battle of Cowpens. I found the love story between Josie and John was my favoir part of the book. I do not what to give anything away. This book gives us many gifts. Robert Morgan gives us poetly, history, and gripping story of love. As well as a taste of the South during the Revolution. I hope Mr. Morgan will write his next book with Joise and John picking up where we last see them. Agreat book that you well be glad you read. It will warm your heart to the very end."
3,"Very descriptive but violent, but left many questions....","I read this book because I like history and the American Revolution. I think that Morgan did a great job describing everything...and I mean everything, but I still had so many questions at the end of the book. For example, how did John finally find himself free of Tartlton? And by the way...what a wimp John was....If you like Morgan's work and like his style, buy this book. If not, go to the library and borrow it. Buy a book by William Martin instead...great author!"
5,Historical read,I like the works of Robert Morgan that I have read. This one did not disappoint me. I also enjoyed The Rock
4,A really fun suspense-mystery with lots of twists and turns.,"Confession: I'm not a reader of the mystery genre (I usually wait for the movie!) My preferences lean toward non-fiction, or the social satire of Vonnegut or Martin Amis. But I liked the title and the cover of this one, so I gave it a try. I found Playing Dead a really fun read. R.G. Belsky managed to keep me guessing thru the whole story and I genuinely couldnt begin to speculate on who the culprit was going to turn out to be until the final chapters. The book is full of twists and unexpected surprises. If you're looking for something to escape into, something light and entertaining...and if you ARE a fan of mysteries... I think you'll really enjoy Playing Dead. (Hey, don't take my word, the guy from Sing-Sing said it was ""the best book he ever read..."". Now that's a testimonial if I ever heard one!)"
3,"a good ""page turner"" of suspense that can be read in 1 hr.","I'm a librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library who spotted this title in the paperback racks. The cover was what attracted me:a fallen chess piece in a pool of blood. Anyway, the book is exactly the kind of book to read on a plane or at the beach-totally escapist and easy to read. The plot is a bit silly(who would anyone trust the word of a confessed serial killer? A newspaper reporter seeking a big story, right?!). But who needs good plotting? As long as it's entertaining, and baby...this one is!!! Interesting characters? Nothing more fascinating than observing sleazeballs...and this one has tons of them. Overall, a good trashy novel that will keep you page turning, although the constant changing of suspects makes a mockery of the whodunit genre. Also, a bit monotonous. Also someone totally F---ed up the printing of the novel."
3,A bit disappointed,"I wanted to love this book. By the title it is exactly what I was looking for for my PhD research. However, I am a computer scientist and am disappointed that models for probability and decision theory were left out of the book. Much of what he is discussing can be represented by Bayesian models such as belief nets and influence diagrams. I think the book will still be valuable, but is oriented more towards statisticians who are using Excel as their only tool."
5,"""On the Shelf,"" UCLAlumni Magazine, May 2002","Allyn Ryan '59, M.F.A.'64 creates an intriguing alternate history in her new science-fiction thriller Salt Mines. Set in a fictional 1980s, Salt Mines rewrites the history of space exploration with a plot that focuses on labor problems in the aerospace industry and tensions that lead to strikes, layoffs and murder--all set against the backdrop of a project to send a manned mission on a ""grand tour"" of the solar system."
3,Different book then in the picture.,"On the picture it shows ford full size vans 1992-2001 but the book i received is 1992-1995 which is no use for me because they did not even have the 4.6L engine that my van has which is a 1997 ford Econoline e150 at least change the picture.I would like to thank the company for the full refund, it made me feel better about you guys now i really believe it was a mistake but please guys update your picture so you don't have any more complaints."
5,Great Author !! 10 Stars,"This emotionally charged novel, written by Chester Himes, tells the true locked up feelings of an african american character, that we to this day somewhat, feel the same. Take a journey with Himes thru this novel going thru the likings/dislikes of everyday life. Himes in so many words said things alot of us still feel to this day. He writes from his soul leaving the reader emotionally drained. I love Chester Himes novels, he thinks and writes what most is scared to say or write. I could now see in his time the world was not ready for Chester Himes, but still true today these feelings and thoughts still exist. Chester Himes May U Rest In Peace !!"
1,Protocol propaganda,"Only by careful omission of Rome's empire does the author claim the Jews were expelled due to their own activities and not for the simple crime of not being Catholic. It wasn't only Jews who were persecuted under the Inquisition.Paul Warburg and the other international bankers--many who are not Jewish--are found on the Pilgrim Society member's list, a Freemason roundtable at the time.The top leaders of the Russian Revolution, and their financial backers, were all Freemason, most who were not Jewish (see Wikipedia: Jewish Bolshevism).These Freemasons are Rome's Templar Knights who have ran world revolution since 1776 after the Inquisition and Jesuits themselves were abolished/banned in 1773.The persecutions have not been about RACE i.e. Jewish & Gentile, rather RELIGION.These are just some errors with books based on the Protocols--produced by the Freemasons themselves to blame their world revolution on the Jews."
1,Gee - this book seems to suggest the Jews are profideous and intolerant & hateful of the dominant culture .. can this be true ??,"""We Jews, we are the destroyers and will remain the destroyers.Nothing you can do will meet our demands and needs. We will forever destroy because we want a world of our own."" p155"
3,"Too tiny, not worth the price","This is a nice looking box but is too tiny, palm size (woman's palm). It fits only a few candies."
3,designer kit,My husband bought the thunderbolt stickers or decals for my son's pinewood derby car. They were a hit. Thanks he loved them.
2,"Too simple, not deep enough",This book does not go into much depth. It touches on a lot of subjects but doesn't get into much detail.
2,Breath?,"The music here is breathtakingly beautiful, unfortunately the recording is terrible. Not for any usual sound problems, but because it surprisingly captured the sniffling, coughing, breathy noises of the performer. I tried to overlook it, but constantly hearing labored breathing and sniffling behind the music is incredibly distracting. I'm guessing he had a cold when he recorded this and the sound guy had no idea what he was doing. Such a pity."
4,Great Fur Trade Era Story,"I enjoyed this film. As a student of the Fur Trade and a living historian I enjoyed the commentary by Rex Norman, James A. Hanson, and Jim Hardee. I've read works by them and enjoyed being able to put faces to the names. Overall, a very good synopsis of the life of Jedediah Smith...worth the money to watch and add to my collection."
5,18 Gospel Favorites,"I'm a big fan of ""old-time"" music and ""early bluegrass.""This is a tremendous album. I was at a small family blugrassfestival in Nine Mile, Tennessee (Edmond's Family Festival), andI asked a vendor if he had any fiddlers' CDs, He had all of the usual ones (Vassar Clements, Chubby Wise, Kenny Baker, but he told me that I had to listen to Mainer. I'd never heard of him.This is authentic music. The vocals are great, I especially like Heavenly Airplane, Lonely Tombs. Job's Coffin, Where You Gonna Hide. The group had apparently played together for years.I am very curious to see if the lead vocalist, Morris Herbert, had any other work recorded; he's great!!Mr. Mainer's fiddle work is great; check ou the intro onThose Lonely Tombs. great stuff!!!!"
4,Crib bedding,"The bedding is very cute; however, it appears to be pink in the picture but is actually peach. There is no pink in the bedding."
3,Nice tunnel.....too expensive,"I actually bought this at a garage sale awhile back and use it for my puppies and dogs. It is cute, but I couldn't believe the price when I saw this online! Maybe it's better for cats, because my puppies will chew on the ""vents"" on either side and pee in it. It isn't easy to clean, and the smell of urine sticks to it even with washing (which I have found to be true with all tunnels/pet toys made from this material). I am glad I bought this from a garage sale, and if I were you, I would go for an actual tunnel instead."
5,BEST CAT TENT EVER,This is the second cat tent I have ordered from Amazon.com. It is the best thing I could have ever bought for my cats. They absolutely love it. They sleep in it and play in it all the time. They look so happy and so comfortable in it. I have a large cat as well and he fits into it just fine. I highly recommend this cat tent to anyone that cares about their cats and how happy they will be.
3,Almost back to Ska,"An improvement over recent specials (AKA, etc.) releases. Closer to the early 80's style. Still a bit over-produced, not quite a skanker. Some of the tracks seem to want to do more, but are strapped down for potential play on the airwaves. All said, It's gettin better all the time. - Jimi Surf"
4,Some glimpses of old glory,"This album blows away their first attempt of a comeback. Guilty is a worthy predesessor to your vintage Specials albums. If the second comeback is that much better than the first, I'm afraid the third could by right on track."
3,not the specials i love...,"had this been anyone other than the specials, i wouldn't have disliked it as much -- they have evolved musically, but unfortunately i don't care for the route they have taken... unlike bad manners, another band of the 2-tone era, the specials have deviated from their original sound... this is a good recording for someone who doesn't mind the change, but not for me.. they do have some bonus tracks of older songs performed live -- that's a treat... whatever."
3,"nice, but not the old times Spacials","it's a quite good CD, but it isn't gonna make history. its a CD tou have to have if you are a fan of the Especials or you have a great collection of ska CD's. But defenetly it's not an esencial"
1,What happened???,"I am a big fan of Gwynne Forster's work, I have read all of her books and truly enjoy her writing. So I am sure you can imagine my shock upon reading Scarlet Woman! The book is below, way below Ms. Forster's writing standards. This book lacked everything, romance, suspense, drama, believability. It was simply sex and silliness. Truly a dissapointment. Ms. Forster did you really write this?"
2,Definitely not usable as a thin-client or web-PC,"I tried to use this product for my two kids to share a PC. I have a fast computer (from their requirements, it should support two of these kits) with enough memory, yet every time my kids go to a ""Flash"" enabled web-site (and that's EVERY kids site out there), the terminals just hang and are unable to go on. Basically a waste of my hard-earned money."
5,A good item to have,"This spout is the best one I've ever used on a plastic gasoline can. It is more rigid, and never leaks like the ones which come with plastic gas cans. Since I live in an area prone to hurricane activity, I have 12 five and six gallon gas cans and have this spout installed on every one of them. It's good to know that an item works as described like this one does."
4,Cute broad has sex with plants! Film at Eleven,"Unfortunatly no film. That's it though. She does it with big red sentient orchids, and her offspring (a football shaped seed) will help mankind survive the end of the universe. Can't get better than that."
1,Pushing Socialized Medicine,"We got this movie at the suggection of our liberal nephew. I believe it is subtly pushing socialized medicine and a ""doctor Kavorcian"" attitude towards the elderly in America. Not surprising since it was produced by the liberal media."
3,"If you know Agile principles, don't bother with this book","The core theory of the book is that feature/stories need to be prioritized based on business value. To anyone doing Agile (Scrum, XP, FDD) this is pretty much standard stuff.What is new in the book is that they provide a framework for tying individual features to future cash flow/benefit for that feature to drive an analysis of net present value.My viewpoint is that this book is very academic in orientation rather than grounded in the real world examples. As an example, there is no detailed example/sample/case study of how future cash flows were determined for a given set of features. The derivation of these values is critical to the applicability of the approach.Do I buy it? No. I think XP User stories prioritized by the customer(s) will be a much more robust mechanism for selecting what to work on next. It will also come at a lower cost."
2,Disappointing,"I read the reviews of this book and had high hopes. I needed a volume that helps me build business cases based on value propositions for management who knows little about software but a lot about business. Well this isn't the book. It is interesting. But, when you try to communicate value in terms that the business community doesn't understand, you fall flat on your face. For example, concepts like incremental funding methodology and minimum marketable features have lots of appeal to technies. But, they don't make sense when to a chief financial officer who doesn't have a deep software or the XP background. Perhaps, the book would work if I worked in a software house that built software using XP and the state-of-the-art. That would be nice. I guess I will search for another volume that is more traditional in its approach."
4,Publisher's Note for the 2004 edition by Clearfield Publishing:,"Before 1650, only a few hundred Scots had trickled into the American colonies. However, by the early 1770s the number had risen to 10,000 per year and would reach a total of around 150,000 by 1785. Who were these Scots? What did they do? Where did they settle? What factors motivated their emigration? David Dobson's work draws on original research on both sides of the Atlantic to comprehensively identify the Scottish contribution to the early settlement of North America."
3,An inside look on scams,This movie shows the greed of the stock exchange. It is a good movie and it shows how shady and desparate people will be to become rich.
4,Great window into the underside of the financial markets,Lot of fun. Well crafted movie that takes you back to an interesting time in our financial history. Really captures New York before its resurrection.
4,Good Movie,The acting is excellent...even though I doubt any normal person would believe their high pressure sales pitch in real life. The character develop is awesome and the ideas and ending are great.
2,Defective,"I bought this tool last weekend for a bathroom project. I used it about 4-5 times to cut some drywall. When I went to change out the extension, I found that my keyless chuck is stuck. It will not open up no matter what I do. I will be returning this over the weekend.I searched Google for ""Rotozip Keyless Chuck"" and found a forum where the person had the exact same problem."
3,Locked up chuck,"Out of the box, the chuck was frozen solid (minus one star). Returned the tool. Their instructions specifically say to call them, do not return it to the vendor. I'm supposed to halt a project while they fix their problem? The replacement worked like the original should have. Subtract another star because I'm not sure this product is worth twice the price of the DeWalt DW660SK kit. But once I had a functioning unit, it works like it is supposed to."
4,Unusual Family Drama,"This film is a vivid depiction of life in Ireland and the long-term affections and alienations that can form in a rural, isolated area. A man whose sister had run off to American years ago finds out she has died and her son is coming to visit the only family he has left. Pierce Brosnan is the sister's left-behind lover and although not one of the central characters, he gives a memorial performance. There is a racial element in the movie which only heightens the drama but primarily the film focuses on hard hearts coming to love again."
3,The Camera Loves the Irish Landscape,The other reviewers deal with the story. It's memorable for me because of two things. First is a rap version of Whiskey in the Jar. Second is the camera's absolute love affair with the Irish landscape. This film gets you as close to Ireland as you can get without setting foot on the soil. The land steals the show and is enough in itself to recommend the film.
2,Wonderful Film,"I saw this movie when my son was 6, he is now 22. This movie is just wonderful. We often don't think of our background and where we come from. It was beautiful acted and the film was just beautiful. It was a shame that it was never seen on the big screen for long. I have tried to edit this to give it a 5 star rating but amazon won't let me so I will say it in my review. 5 starts!!!!"
1,Irritates Scalp,I bought this at Sally beauty supply store locally. I wanted to give it a test run as a hot oil treatment first before trying to add it to my regimen. Within a minute after applying there was some tingling but I just assumed that was the tea tree oil. But after about seven minutes my scalp just felt hot and sore so I immediately washed it out. My scalp was red and small red bumps showed up not long after. I have used a majority of the oils listed as ingredients individually and have not shown any sensitivity so I'm assuming it's this product over an actual allergic reaction.
2,Maybe works but causes acne breakouts,"I only used this one time (over the weekend) and it made my hair super greasy (unsurprising, since it's oil) and gross. I left it in for about 24hrs and had to lather my hair with shampoo 2x to get it out. Also, I got 4 new zits over the next 2 days, which I attribute to this product, since I rarely get acne.Overall, it did seem to make my hair thicker and more sleek, but if I were to use it again I would dump it into a little spray bottle so that I could disperse it throughout my hair more evenly and more sparingly. Or I would apply a little to my fingertips and massage just a little bit into my scalp. I would also recommend tying your hair back so the oil doesn't get on your face and cause you to break out."
2,At best: frizz ease. Not much else,"The hair product touts itself as a hair growth/thickness stimulant: on this count, I find the oil lacking. It is best used by people with frizz trouble or who have curly and rough hair that has management issues. The one completely positive thing about the oil is its price."
1,DID NOTHING,"PEOPLE SHOULDN'T GIVE FALSE HOPES. THATS NOT NICE.HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE PROMISED YOU. NICE RESULTS,PROMISING YOU."
3,interpretation of Tchaikovsky,"There is a sense of warmness in the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. Although the playing was good, spiccato and a faster speed in the Finale would be more ideal."
4,Too Slow,"Takako Nishikazi is a very good player, though his tempos are extremely slow. I don't know anybody who played the first movement of Tchaikovsky in 20 minutes, I have heard 19 minutes, but 20 minutes is too slow. The last movement is played in almost 12 minutes, which is also extremely slow. His Mendelssohn is slow, but acceptable. If he just increased the speed a little bit, he would be a great virtuoso."
4,"""Wildness"" can have many definitions!","In her own home setting, the protagonist is indeed the wildest woman around, and the reader cheers and chuckles at her bicycle riding and cigar smoking. However, faced with another woman who's been out in the woods for a long time, Charlotte realizes that she was only playing at liberation in her safe life back home, and when she becomes truly lost in the woods, all of her bravado vanishes. Her real gratitude for the comfort and teachings of her new wooly friends is truly touching.I'm reminded of Patrick White's novel, _A Fringe of Leaves_, as I read this, and of how much that novel caused me to reconsider certain societal strictures in my own life._Wild Life_ is so well written that I need to reread it and then turn to the criticism that will surely help me to understand the multiple levels of the story and all of the accompanying quotations which add a great deal to the tale!"
2,Disappointment,"Having read all of Molly Gloss's previous books, I was eager for this to arrive. However, I found it bitterly disappointing.Far too many 'dropped in' quotes from other authors and too much jumping around. It perhaps could have been two books; I struggled to finish as I rarely stop once started on a book, but certainly didn't yearn to just sit and read as I had with ""Jump Off Creek"" never wanting that story to end."
5,Rich book. Wonderful adventure.,One of the few books that I just couldn't put down. Kept me up way past my bedtime!!
2,Disappointing,"AFter reading ""The Hearts of Horses"" and ""The Jump-Off Creek I was disappointed in ""Wild Life"". I think I was expecting something like the other two books and had a hard time getting through this one."
1,Too much Rambling,"I have to admit, I did not finish this book. There was just too much rambling for me. I was half way through and the meat of the story had barely begun. She would go off on a tangent talking about other stuff and I had trouble following what she was talking about.Maybe if I would have stuck to it,it would have gotten better, but if a book doesn't grab me from the start , I have a hard time reading it."
3,overwhelmed,"Quite frankly, I loved Molly Gloss' _The Jump off Creek_.Quite frankly this was just about the weirdest, most schizophrenic book I have ever read. Unfortunately, I was really attracted to it; the issues of a strong minded woman living in the early 1900's, the area of interest being the northern pacific, the early logging historic period, and other fish bait that would entice many of us to turn the pages of this book. Obviously, enough of us did so as to qualify for mention...However, as much as I want to scream out in favor of this book, it equally drove me insane.I will refrain from citing the background, as that is done quite well by the previous reviewers.My review is of one quite overwhelmed. Ms. Gloss wrote a beautiful novel, she just, quite simply wrote too damn much."
5,"Thrilling, earthy.","This story is sheer joy on so many levels. The protagonist, Charlotte, is a 35 yr old educated and independent widow with 5 sons, living in the pioneer outbacks in the Washington/Oregon area 100 years ago. She's managed to support her family writing ""minor"" romantic novels. When her housekeeper's little grandaughter disappears while under the care of the father at work in a logging camp deep deep in the forests, she sets off to help find the child. The written language is glorious..I remember my great grandmother using some of the same phrases. Her descriptions of pioneer life, life in the logging camps, the forests, and her obvious love and respect for animals and the environment is nothing short of thrilling. Charlotte becomes separated from her group and lost in the forest, eventually following a family of wild animals in an effort to survive. Very exciting, earthy, sensual, basic.."
4,Interesting collection,"One of Don's last collections to be released on both CD and LP, this is basically his 60s work from the Mickie Most years (including the re-recorded versions of ""Catch the Wind"" and ""Colours""). This also has four bonus tracks that hadn't been released on CD until the time of it's release (1989). Somehow the first note of ""Barabajagal"" is missing..."
4,Great for the price!,"this karaoke cd is great! if you are dixie chicks fan, buy this cd! it's worth it with all of their popular hits"
3,Spectacular samplings,"3 1/2One of the under-valued group's most accomplished efforts, Estradasphere has taken the genre-defying palate from influences past and streamlined that into something light years away from gimmick- only in its last leg does anything become less than fabulous."
1,Don't do it!,"I am buying a second LaCie drive in an attempt to rescue documents that I thought would be safe on my original drive that has crashed after about 1.5 years. $160 for the second drive (which I intend to swap parts with in an effort to resurrect my data) is a much cheaper solution than spending two to ten times that amount to have my data professionaly rescued. (A service LaCie doesn't offer!) Please... read the forums before you buy this drive! Had I done so, I would not have come near this drive with a stick!"
1,Don't bother,"This CD has ""She Blinded Me With Science,"" but it's the album version, and it's definately NOT live. Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't."
3,A band with promise,"Dollshead is something of a cross between Garbage and Curve, but they lack the spunk of former and the depth and density of the latter. I enjoyed some of the songs on this album, but the lyrics needed polish and content, as well as the instrumentation. I greatly look forward to their next album as they find a bit more direction and maturity. It's a good deput album, but it's not terribly novel."
1,Awful!,"I agree with the other reviewer, these cookies taste odd and that's an understatement. I bought them for my granddaughter and am so glad that I decided to snitch one before giving them to her. I expected a lightly sweetened cracker, but what I got was an odd plastic-chemical taste that was horrible. Ugh, now I need a real cookie to get the taste out of my mouth, lol."
5,WOW!!,What a great way to pass time between playoff rounds. Mr Allen had done his research. I can't watch Bill Clement without laughing so hard from his recollection of the Flyers Victory parade. A touching story is also included about Rocket Richard and his famed input on the Cup lore. Also a surprising and VERY sentimental touch of Pat Verbeek's day with the Cup in 1999. It's nice to see guys like him with even more reverence for the Cup.
5,Batter Up!,"This book had me laughing in my mixing bowl. The author's stories may be about her childhood in the South, but they manage to send you back to the kitchens and recipe boxes of your own past. I want to bake all the recipes here and maybe even invite my friends over for a luncheon of ""Lady Food."" I guess that's how you become a member of the Cake Club, too."
3,A PG-13 cookbook!!!,FYI to those who are not expecting sex and swearing in a cookbook-this one has both.
1,does not ship in 24 hrs,"i ordered this for my son because the site said ships in 24 hrs. i ordered on dec. 16 it was shipped on dec. 23 and was received on dec. 30.where i learned to tell time, it would have been shipped on dec. 17. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS BEFORE YOU NEED THE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Building Out a Network with Bearskins and Stone Knives,"While primarily a history book, it contains a decent explanation of the technology. However, I thought it provided a substantial (~250 page) case study on the difficulties of building out a network with (then) bleeding edge technology and primitive engineering and management techniques. There are many possible analogies to be made between this cable and the internet. For example, The Crown just about financed its construction the way DARPA financed the early Net."
2,"A ""Thin"" Cable","Interesting subject, but not a well-told. Given the book's short length, about 220 pages, he devotes a surprising amount of the book to backgrounding. In a book of this length, you really have to cut to the chase. For instance, we get 20 pages, or a little less than 10% of the book, describing the history of the Great Eastern, the massive ship that finally laid the cable. And a number of pages devoted to the family of Cyrus Field, the man who came up with the whole idea. Why? Not every fact, newpaper article, and speech that a researcher finds is relevant. Needs focus."
3,The 19th century moon landing,"This is the story of a technological quantum leap, the kind of leap that was rare in the 19th century, but became so common in the 20th that we came to expect a continuous stream of miracles. It's a short book and if you're a quick reader, you might polish it off in one sitting. Not knowing much about the tale of the first transatlantic cables, I can't say how appropriate the level of detail is in this volume, but I can say that it was informative and engaging. As with all tales of great technological leaps, there is intrigue and drama with all of the requisite disasters and personal breakdowns of the prime movers involved. Pick it up for your next plane trip. It will make you look at your cell phone in a whole new light."
5,A little niche of history that changed the world,"It's hard to imagine how different life was for people living in the 19th century after the successful laying of the first trans-Atlantic cable. This book tells the story of the laying of that cable and at the same time paints a portrait of Cyrus Field, the entreprenuer who laid the cable, and a period of time when so much about life was changing for inhabitants of the western world. Perhaps no other invention shrunk the world as quickly and as meaningfully as the trans-Atlantic cable.John Steele Gordon always manages to imbue his writing of history with color and character that draws the reader into the story and keeps the pages turning quickly and easily; ""Thread Across the Ocean"" is no exception. This is a book for anyone who enjoys well-written history."
5,The Atlantic cable,"Most people of my generation (the ""Baby Boomers"") learned a bit about the Atlantic cable in school, and the name of Cyrus Field was known to us. That's about all that we knew, but this book fills in quite nicely the entire story of how the cable came into existence, and the persistence that it required to have the work completed. There were many disappointments, and they are well laid out in the book.Along with the story itself there are excellent thumb nail biographies of the major figures, and that's very helpful.This is a story of dogged goal pursuing in the face of many obstacles, and should serve as an inspiration to anyone who persists in seeking their dream, no matter what it may be."
2,Rage is real,"Heightism in the U.S. is real. The author describes examples of discrimination and bigotry toward people less tall. Most of what she describes is biographical. I think she fails to uncover or provide analysis as to the sociological causes for this seemingly irrational behavior. Also, she does not seem to understand that heightism and discrimination toward shorter men is much greater than toward shorter women."
1,Socialist Crap,"Thank God I did not buy this book, but scanned it in the bookstore. It's just a bunch of left-wing ""I am a victim"" silliness. What bothers me is that this woman is an associate professor in a taxpayer-supported university and spreads her garbage at taxpayer expense. I regard that as criminal."
5,Should be required viewing for all who backed the Iraq War,"Wow. This well done documentary illustrates how politicians can start a war like this. Great sumarization of the government mentality and deceit that went into the leadup to the war in Iraq. Too bad the networks won't show this, probably it would embarass the owners. Past US leaders warned about letting the defense industry and government combine to start a war and this dvd clearly points out that it has come to be, even more obvious than in Vietnam."
2,Left too much to be desired,"I think this movie was on the right track, and it was well made for a documentary. The problem is it seriously lacked content. It did little but scratch the surface of what it wanted to say about the military-industrial complex. It should have delved much deeper into things like how much Boeing/NG and other companies were being paid by the goverment for projects.It would tease you with tidbits like 'every state is responsible for making part of the B2' (inferring it's a strategy to continue the political/economic demand to produce them. . . but then leave out SO MUCH potential information.Overall, I was pretty disappointed."
4,Did you know,I learned so much from this film. Much that I suspect the average person wouldn't know the true meaning behind what America has done and why. What we weren't told to insure our continued support is a real eye-opener! Food for thought for sure.
1,"If you like Michael Moore, you'll love this movie","This is an intellectually dishonest movie, starting with the title, which leads one to believe it's a modern day version of a Frank Capra classic. The real title should be: ""How the military industrial complex makes us fight because we're too stupid to think for ourselves and it's a lie that millions of people living under brutal dictatorships lack freedom.""Right off the bat, the film shows a former CIA agent talking about blowback, with the inference that 9-11 was our fault for trying to liberate millions in the Muslim world.If you approve of Michael Moore's theory that health care in Cuba is better than the U.S., this is the film for you."
1,"Vacuous propaganda, but slickly produced","This is a big disappointment. There are plenty of good arguments they could have marshaled to make their case, but instead they merely had various ""talking heads"" stating personal opinions, presenting them as incontrovertible facts. And endlessly repeating of minor variations on the theme.If you like the genre, the use of visuals and music in the transitions is quite good. However, the attempted manipulation is painfully obvious: The argumentation is so deficient that the slick production values highlight that weakness.Other reviewers' citing of Michael Moore's work as comparable are misplaced. Moore has lower production values but substantially better argumentation."
1,Caution,"Thankfully, I borrowed this from a friend. Do not waste your money on this unless, perhaps, you have an affinity for Michael Moore-type garbage. I will not waste my time with an in-depth review. Caveat Emptor."
4,Telling truth to power...,A valuable production that should be shown in every high school in America.
5,The Best EVER.,"This is probably the most moving and informative documentary I've ever seen. I wish it lasted all day and exposed more of what is truly going on with war.Personally, my #1 pick of all time for documentaries. That's pretty damn big."
5,Listen to the Military Industrial Complex prediction,Cleary one of the greatest presidents our great country has been blessed to have has shown us through an eerie prediction that our country is currently living during the age of the Military Industrial Complex. We must listen to our past as so we do not relive the predictions of our future.
4,Please Watch It,"I found the main point of the movie, about the military-industrial complex and its influences, a bit exaggerated. No doubt they play a part in decisions to go to war, but the sole or even the primary reason ... is a bit exaggerated. However, a lot of the subterfuge I found particularly good. Chalmers Johnson's discussion of ""blowback"" in this movie led me to read his book. Also, there was a colonel taking about the Pentagon's Center For Strategic Plans, that was created to bypass the CIA and DIA with fabricated reasons for war, etc. These things, that were secondary issues, haven't appeared as well anywhere else. It's in these things that I found the most satisfying from the movie.It's definitely worth the watch, but the arms industry is exaggerated. I recommend that viewers also readIraq: The Logic of Withdrawalfor a better understanding of why we invaded Iraq."
4,interesting documentary; not just another Bush basher,"I found this documentary to be absorbing, though not riveting. Itcovered a long period of time, back to the Eisenhower administrationand his famous speech warning of the danger of an uncontrolled MilitaryIndustrial complex. Worthwhile for those interested in American history."
3,Follows the beaten path but insightful,"After the all that we know about the debacle that is the Iraq war, this documentary does not reveal any shocking truths. It blames the 'military industrial war machine' for un-necessary wars, but any informed citizen knows that already, and as the documentary suggests, knows we are powerless to do anything about it. Even though the documentary repeats the same reasons that are fortunately mainstream now with this unpopular war, it does offer some insight into the history and the beginnings of the `profit greedy machine' that drives American wars."
1,"Superb Documentary, Lousy DVD Pressing","The film is a superb investigation into the history of American empire. That is, as much of it as the irregular stuttering of the playback on this poorly-pressed DVD would allow me to watch before I gave up in frustration.Sony did a botch job of the production of this film on DVD.Because of Amazon's policy prohibiting the return of opened DVDs, I would recommend against buying this DVD new from Amazon. There are several well-recommended vendors listed on Amazon that guarantee the used DVD you purchase from them will be playable, or you can return it for an exchange, or for your money back. If you can't see this fine film in its theatrical release, buying it used from one of those vendors would be your next best bet. At least then, if you get a defective DVD like I did, you would have some recourse."
3,More of the same.,"Not bad, but not great either. Simply more of the same. Worth watching, some points and arguments definitely worthy of consideration, but don't expect impartiality or objectivity. If nothing else, it's good for keeping abreast of current liberal/pacifist/defeatist doctrine."
5,My thoughts,"Truly a ""MUST SEE"" video! I am shareing this with all of my family and many friends. We had better wake up to what is happening while we let ""them"" run the country and pay little attention to what is happening to our industrial complex. It may already be too late!"
5,why america fights ...,very informative movie ... shows all the wars that the USA has been involved with to protect our freedom ... viewpoints of different individuals ... you decide if we did the right thing ... there is a price to pay for our way of life ... interesting ... thank you for offering it on your website ...
3,DNA test prove that Anna Anderson was NOT Anastasia,"I read this book about 15 years ago and found it fascinating. Fortunately or unfortunately, the ""riddle"" has been solved: DNA tests run subsequent to the book's publication prove with virtual certainty that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia, so the ""cat's out of the bag"" before you read the first sentence. It's actually a shame because I did very much enjoy the book before the information came out."
1,Silly...,"A very silly fable spun by a man almost clinically obsessed with the fraud Franciszka Szanckowska (note that Kurth cannot even spell her name right, making it into some bizarre ""Schanskowska""), alias Anna Anderson, the person who claimed to have been Princess Anastasia and who was exposed decades ago by Grand Duke Ernest and the team of detectives he hired... Nowadays this book about a has-been fraud is interesting only from a psychological point of view - as a fine example of obsession and denial of one man, and its influences on his psyche (Kurth cannot even force himself to accept the results of DNA tests, proving that ""Anderson"" was Szanckowska, and he denies them)"
1,Another one for the nutjobs,"The credibility of this book should have been destroyed by the DNA testing which disclosed Anna Anderson's true identity, but of course there are stil circles of people out there who will bend over backwards to invent any and every theory that works with their fantasy. If the science doesn't agree with them, then of course the science must be wrong. What else is new? That in the year 2007 people continue to tout this imposter as Anastasia is an insult to Anastasia's memory."
5,A very good book about a very sad and intriguing mystery,"I have always been keenly interested in Anastasia/Anna Anderson and this well written book was quite an education! Despite the ""DNA evidence"", I truly believe that this woman was exactly who she claimed to be. Mr. Kurth's research was well done and the information jumped out at me as though I were there myself. She was fortunate to have such a champion on her side."
5,The best book about Anna Anderson!,"This is the best book about Anna Anderson, from all I've read so far! This is particularly evident contrast compared to the last book of G. King and P. Wilson (""The Resurrection of the Romanovs: Anastasia, Anna Anderson, and the World's Greatest Royal Mystery"" - an extremely biased book)"
5,Looking back on Anna Anderson,"""Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson"" was written before the ""official"" discovery of the Romanov bones, therefore, Anna Anderson could not have undergone DNA testing, when this book was published in 1983. Without getting into the DNA testing, there is one question throughout the story of Anna Anderson that was either never asked by Kurth or never asked by Anna Anderson's opponents. According to Anderson's story, she [""Anastasia""] escaped Ekaterinburg with an Ipatiev House guard, Alexander Tschaikovsky. ""Anastasia"" and Tschaikovsky made their way to Bucharest, Romania--where ""Anastasia"" gave birth to a son, and the two were married in a Catholic church. Here's the problem. Anastasia Romanov was Orthodox. Why would she marry in a Catholic church? In Russia, this could be understandable; but in Romania, which is also predominately Orthodox? That is one question Kurth, or Anderson's opponents, never asked."
1,She's NOT Anastasia,"Okay, so it may seem exciting that someone actually survived the massacre of the Romanovs. It's fanciful, romantic....blah, blah, blah. I could remain open to speculation. But the DNA evidence proves that Anna Anderson was nothing but a big time fraud. And to think that her husband was deluded into thinking he married royalty. He married a peasant who fooled the world."
2,What's the mystery?,What's the mystery? The DNA evidence conclusively shows that she was a fraud. What more is there to say?
5,Fascinating story of a mysterious person,"Mr. Kurth has written an excellent biography of the mysterious Anna Anderson, the woman who appeared in Berlin in the twenties claiming to be a member of the Romanov family. Gradually she came to be known as Anastasia, identified as such by hangers on of the Czar's court. Mr. Kurth researches Ms. Anderson's history thoroughly and leaves the reader wondering. I literally could not put this book down. I carried it with me everywhere until I was finished and then gave it to my sister who did the same thing."
4,Good Reference Book,This book is a good reference book to use in order to learn to write Kanji. I have had this book for many years and used it many times. Excellent book for the student to use as study material.
4,2000 Basic Japanese Characters,"I was amazed at this book and the ammount of effort P.G.O'Neil and everyone who helped him put into it! This book is very good for people who want to study Japanese Kanji, but you have to have a basic knowledge of the langauge first. Serching for Kanji won't help if you don't know the amount of strokes in a ideogram. If you are for example reading a manga, and you have the kanji in front of you then this book can be helpful. It even gives you tips to remember the ideogram, which I find very helpful. Each kanji is written in 3 different ways, to give you a better feel of how to write it. It's written with the computer, with a ball pen and with a typical Japanese brush. Thats about all I have to say. Ok, I hope that was helpful. :-)"
4,Very good reference and learning tool.,"I use this book to both index unfamiliar kanji when translating and reading manga and memorizing kanji. It has a very good index listing characters by their readings, which is very easy to use. The only problem with this index is that the reading must be known to easily find a character. I've found that indexing by stroke count is quite useless for a beginner.Using this as a learning tool is very good as the characters are presented clearly with stroke counts in calligraphy, hand-printed characters, and characters in type font. It provides two words in which the kanji are used, different readings for the characters, and the basic meaning.This is a good book for a beginning and novice reader or learner."
4,nice book,"I found this book fun to browse through. The calligraphy is great (much nicer than the otherwise superior Henshall book), and I like how the Chinese readings were included (comparing them with the Japanese readings is amusing). The information is a bit outdated since the book only covers the old Toyo Kanji and some others instead of the revised Joyo Kanji in current use.Ivan Rorick"
1,Pointless,"There is no reason to buy this book. It is not a kanji dictionary, so it will be of limited use for that purpose. It also has very limited use as a self-instruction text, because the order the kanji are presented in is illogical for foreign learners (so many times you end up learning a complicated kanji, only to find that simple parts of that kanji turn up as their own kanji *later in the book*), and there are no mnemonics of any kind. Many compound words are presented, but there is no information on how to actually use them, so you cannot use it to learn new vocabulary unless you already know the words. The stroke order diagrams are mildly helpful, but you can find animated ones online for free (WWWJDIC will have a diagram for probably every single kanji in the book). Basically, the book amounts to one big kanji list. Henshall's Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters, Heisig's Remembering the Kanji, etc. are much better than this."
2,So-so,"I bought this book 4 years ago and have barely used it at all. I like the fact that it gives stroke order, but it does not have all the readings for each character, it does not provide any mnemonics or historical origins, and the individual kanji are not numbered, making it a pain to find them easily.A much better book is Spahn and Hadamitzky's ""Guide to Kanji and Kana"", or Kenneth Henshall's ""Guide to Remembering the Japanese Characters."""
4,Ok if you already have a course of study,"I would not call this book ""an integrated course for learning to read and write"" as the description says.There is a ""How to Use This Book"" section at the beginning, but other than that, it's really just a compilation of the most common kanji characters. I like the arrangement of the characters for learners, but this really wasn't the book for me; I needed more of a workbook! Fortunately I found ""Basic Kanji Book, Vol. 1"" by Chieko Kano.However, I'm keeping this book. If you are a disciplined student who has a program of study already, this will be a good reference book."
3,A good Buy,"I've tried several kanji learning books and this one is not a bad one. I think the only cool part was that it also has the Mandarin reading and traditional characters. For each word only two compounds are given, and only uses kanji that has already been introduced as it introduces compounds. So you keep on expanding your vocabulary that uses these new kanji. I think this is a super effective way of remembering kanji, especially if you write a few sentences with the new compounds. It doesn't always point out which words have awkward readings, though I think it's a nice course though but I'd say it'd would be a lot better if you also GetThe Kodansha Kanji Learners Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)because it just goes so much more into detail and lists a lot more compounds. The two go hand in hand, one as a course and the other as reference."
5,Excellent for moderate level learns,"Before I purchased this book I was pretty well into the Japanese language. That being said, I think that people at the beginning level should make sure that they're, at the very least, up to par on their vocabulary before purchasing this book (let alone delving into any type of kanji based text). Also, make sure that you're able to use and understand hiragana and katakana. Once you're comfortable with your skills and knowledge of the Japanese language (perhaps on a moderate level), then you should most definitely try to get your hands on this. It's very easy to follow, gives you a break down on both the Japanese and Chinese pronunciation for each character, and also gives you several examples on how each character is used in conjunction with others. I loved this book and I am very glad that I purchased it."
4,"Interesting, but has some index problems","First let me say I am not studying Japanese. I study writing systems and letterforms and I bought this book because I wanted to see how the characters for various objects differed (like tree versus branch, and so on). For what I'm doing, I need to be able to look up a word in the index and then go to the page with the Kanji character. However, several things I tried to look up had the wrong page number referenced."
1,disapointed,"I've payed for this book,twice, but I've never received it.Thanks, Amazon.I'll never buy whith you."
3,Eight cards per page: eye strain?,"With 8 sections ( 8 kanji information boxes ) per page, the kanji INSIDE the detailed information area are almost too small for me to read - and I have not been using reading glasses for long (being under 60.) I find myself using a magnifying glass.On the plus side, I find it a useful small book for 2000+ kanji - but without stroke order.I am using the 16th Ed of 2007. There are over 50 pages of useful indices at the back of the book.By way of comparison: the full size Henshall has 3 Kanji sections per page in the ""mnemonics"" edition (but is 300 pages longer) and still only 5 per page in the ""reading and writing"" version.If you have acute eyesight and want a small volume, it is a good collection for 2000+.Is there a publisher with 3 books of 700 each in this size/format?"
3,It's a great help. But...,It's really great but I don't really understand how the book is formatted. It may be just me. But still it's a really great book for learning Japanese!
3,Excellent Beginner's Kanji Reference,"I have had this book for 13 years. It is an excellent first kanji book. For mastery of the kanji, use this book first and then go into a detailed kanji book as you gain more confidence.Excellent first book."
5,An excellent choice,"This small book is an excellent learning tool for several reasons.First the kanji characters are helpfully written in the brush style, pen style and typical print style. Seeing all three together is a great help in identifying the differences these styles can often have. The book also includes older versions of characters that have been simplified.Second the usage examples are progressive. Each new kanji's vocabulary examples will only use other kanji's you've already learned. I think this ""one word at a time"" approach is an effective way to progress in your studies.Finally the index has three different listings by Romanji, English and character stroke count. This provides an effective way to look up any characters you may have forgotten or are just interested in learning.It's an excellent, easily portable book for studying your kanjis. Highly recommended."
4,cool book,This is a very neat book.It helped me win alot of rounds.It has cool pages.This should win awards.I say to any body who has a mortal kombat game should read this book.
5,"Bravo! A lively cd, indeed!","I agree with the Youngstown opinions; this cd is lively, well played, well recorded, and worth the listening."
4,GREAT BOOK,BOOK WAS GREAT. IT PRESENTS A MATURE CHRISTIAN VIEW ABOUT SEXUAL ISSUES THAT ARE STILL TOO RARELY DISCUSSED IN CHURCH SETTINGS AND EVEN WHEN DISCUSSED ARE POORLY AND INCONSISTENTLY ADDRESS
5,floor protection pads for dogs,"I have 3 elderly dogs who are finding it harder to not make a mess while we are at work. These pads have been helpful in keeping the basement clean. They were never paper trained, but do use the pads about 75% of the time."
1,Worthless,"These pads are thin and minimally absorbent. ""Extra thick"" is absolutely not an attribute of this product."
4,My Dog has a 2 Pad a Day habit...,"I have used Potty Pappers for My Dog not long after I got him home & they have worked out well for our needs,I also agree that the price is pretty high for what they are made of & what they are used for,but I use them so I gotta pay as long as I need to.I would've given 5 Stars except for the Cost part but the Product is a VG one."
2,Too hard to separate,"I purchased this product due to the price. But, I guess you get what you pay for. It takes what seems like FOREVER to separate the pads from its folded position. When it's finally separated, the plastic ends stick together causing the cotton underneath to come loose. What a mess the pads make - even before the dog makes a mess."
2,too costly now,I originally purchased these in December 2006 for about 9.99 per package...that was a great buy and I am sure that everyone involved made money (the Out! people and Amazon). Now you can see the price has almost doubled in only 7 months. I'll just buy these locally...though I do keep checking to see if the price is going to be dropped to a more reasonable level. Very frustrating.
3,not much better,"I have a small Bichon with chronic renal failure and when she urinates it's quite a bit, as she is unable to concentrate her urine. I didn't find this product any more absorbant. Somehow it ends up leaking under the plastic. So far the best I've found is only sold in packages of 3, ""Clifford the Big Red Dog non- slip pads"". I've tried them all!."
3,Dog Training Pads,"These pads were disappointing but usable. I expected them to be thicker and bigger than my usual brand, but they were pretty much the same. I would buy them again if they reduced their price."
4,Worked pretty good!,"Have 2 small dogs and long work hours - so like to provide a bit of insurance with pads - and these were absorbant, reduced odor, and they seemed to like them - unlike some cheaper versions that they tended to avoid."
4,great techniques aplenty,This is a great book wrote using the techniques that are so plentifully supplied throughout the text. I did have some problems accessing the online supplemental activities. This was really a disappointment because I liked and wanted further information in the practices that were covered in the text. These were inaccessible without paying extra for them on the publisher's site.
4,Interesting Info,"This book is good with lots of ideas of how to help students across content areas. A little expensive for what you get - if I wouldn't have had to have the 8th edition for a college class, I would go with an earlier edition."
3,Kindle edition NOT functionally equivalent!,"I just purchased this for a graduate class I am taking. Because it was supposed to be ""functionally equivalent"" I thought it would have actual page numbers. It does not! If I can't cite the text, it's useless. Extremely disappointed in Amazon not being forthcoming about this issue, especially considering the cost of the text."
3,NO CD included!,"I purchased this book, considered the fact that it was more expensive on this site than my own university bookstore, but since I had to purchase items on here anyways, I went ahead and added it to my order to save on shipping. HOWEVER, it should be noted that this text does NOT include the CD-ROM (a requirement for my class) I had to return the book and search elsewhere for a copy that included the CD-ROM."
5,College daughter loved the book,"Short review - she said she loved the book (my college daughter). Nothing more to add at this time. Since you require more words, Jesus is the Lord and Savior of the World. God Bless."
1,Disappointing,"I did not receive the correct book, I was sent a different book.Extremely disappointed. Needed this book for school and had to wait two weeks after receiving the wrong book before I had my money back to purchase the correct book. Will not use Amazon again for books I need immediately."
3,Amazon sells book without access code for digital content,"This book is supposed to come with access to digital content that is crucial for demonstrating concepts. According to the book's website, an access code is provided with each new book. However, when I purchased this book new on Amazon it had no access code.I regularly purchase textbooks on Amazon and usually they come with all required access codes. Often my college professors do not require accessing the digital content. However, this is one book where the digital content is essential to completing the course. I do not recommend purchasing this particular book at Amazon. CengageBrain sells the book with access code for a similar price.I ended up returning this book to Amazon, explaining the lack of digital access code, and they promptly refunded my money. Thank you Amazon!I have not yet read past the first chapter of the book, so I cannot comment on content. The 3-star rating is because I do not recommend getting this book on Amazon."
4,Jason Donovan - Some Great Hits,"Jason Donovan never made it big here in the States, but for what reason, I don't know. Produced by the same hit makers that made names for Rick Astley, Kylie, Bananarama, etc., Jason's hits are just as catchy and fun, even if they're not as familiar to US listeners. You'll find yourself addicted, I guarantee."
3,Not for U.S. Listeners,"This is actually a quite old album from like 1987. Not sure why they compile it into a CD in 1991. ""Especially For You"" with Kylie Minogue was really REALLY popular in Australia, Europe, and in Asia, except the U.S. (as usual). Album is mediocre; 1 of those albums in which all the songs sound alike..... Appealed more to teenages of the 80s."
2,Annoying,"This book has its qualities. But a few times I was tempted to put it down, or skip some pages.The plot is too winding - it goes around and around.And the main character does so many silly things that in the end it became impossible for me to feel some empathy with him.It's a pity, because a rewriting of probably 20% of the book could have made it a very nice one."
1,Warning - serious shrinkage,"Nice sheets, as long as you don't have one of the new mattresses, or plan on getting one.My mattress is 15"", and these sheets are supposed to work with 18"" mattresses.The sheets fit - just - when I got them - but now, six months later, they do not fit."
3,Tovolo Collapsible Silicone Cooking Cover,"""Collapsible"" is the correct description of this item. When is it not collapsible? In spite of it's mostly flattened state, it does rise a wee bit when using it in the microwave and it serves as a decent cover when using it on skillet on the stove (sort of like a flat cover that does vent the steam). I'm not thrilled with it, but it has it's usefulness to a certain degree."
1,What size is the damned thing?,There is no way of knowing from the description what size pot this will fit on.
1,Way too detailed for any child!,"We were very disappointed when we opened the box and found such tiny pieces, and such flimsy foam pieces.The directions weren't very helpful, and way too small! It took my husband and I more than an hour with our grandson just to make the head, and the pieces didn't fit properly and not all of the pieces were there. My grandson got very frustrated and walked away without wanting to go any farther. That was fine with us!We were very disappointed, because it looked like it would have been great. He adores dinosaurs!"
4,"Good for building, but not playing with","If your child likes building things they will love this. Very fun to put together - you can build three different dinosaurs, but you can also use your imagination to make your own creations. My son loved building these. Only problem is that you can't really play with them after they are built because they tend to fall apart with light play. So once you make there's not much else to do with them."
5,Live Album finally demonstrates the Genius of Buckley,"Finally, Buckley's incredible vocal range is shown in all its exceptional prowess. The stand out track is the astounding ""Gypsy Woman"" (where Timmy wants the spell cast on him, always the ironic iconoclast) that has Buckley going from a counter tenor to a falsetto to a banshee wail. Simply astounding. If you know nothing about Tim Buckley, this is the album to purchase to get yourself duly informed. A fantastic record of a man before his time."
2,old chocolates,Ordered in early December for a Christmas present. The recipiant asked me where I had ordered the chocolates for they claim that the chocolates were old (maybe from last year?)Very disappointing since it was given as a gift
5,An excellent introduction!,"This is the best introductory text on quantum optics that I've read. Its very clear and up to date. The only book that compares as far as clarity of presentation is Loudon's ""Quantum Theory of Light"" which is a little out of date. This book is a must have for any grad. student in AMO physics !"
1,Cheap Junk!,This product was useless. It was basically a very cheap tape patch with adhesive that was so weak that it fell of the screen within hours. Save your money and dont purchase this.
3,Screen patch works.,The patch is plastic that sticks to the screen. It was the size I wanted and it is effective. I put a patch on each side of the screen to make it stronger and it works. It is probably easier than using a patch made out of screen.
4,Loved the Series,"Although this book seemed a bit out of it for the Series. I still liked it.I have read this series twice now and I'm sure it will be a future read-over. First few books were from a friend at the time, used - and I was hooked. They weren't in order though, and of course I wanted to read the whole series once I started. Took a while back then to get them all, but I have been happy with my choice to get them and keep them even after the friendship with the person who got me hooked ended badly. Good things can come from anywhere.I was reading this series when I met my Husband. He helped me finish getting them all."
5,Still listening to it...,"Let me start off by saying that I RARELY listen to the same CD over and over and over. But I bought this one at the Release concert in Hollywood in Sept/Oct..(I don't remember)..and I am STILL listening to it..It's definitely an album and not just a collection of individual songs. Each song transitions into the next song. He skillfully combines a variety of textures, instruments and beats.The lyrics are from the heart and not just ""Praise Jesus, Praise God, I need you Jesus..etc.. They're deep and poetic.Way to go DCB. Keep it up."
5,Help for ALL Marriages,"When it comes to helping people 'fix' their marriages, the Farrells are the ones to call upon. Their new book provides inspiration, practical'tools' and down-to-earth examples that any couple can relate to. I recommend this to every married couple, whether or not your relationship needs an update!"
2,Not deluxe,"Product does not fit description. I expected thicker pads than regular ones as they were called ""Deluxe"" pads. My lab mix puppy likes to tear them up. Sometimes she uses it but sometimes not. They do not absorb well and leaks through the back. Does not deodorize to prevent odors. Price is nice but product is what you pay for."
1,Expensive Potty Pads,I would recommend using your local Wal-Mart! These same potty pads are $6.97 for 32 pads!
2,No absorbtion,"It does what it says, but not as well.Pros: Absorbs? Protects floor.Cons:It's like using cotton. The absorbent is not evenly distributed. Does not absorb well. Clumpy. Top rips easily. Bottom rips, but not as easily. Puppies are tempted to shred it. Puppy is attracted to it. May do ""#1"" but not ""#2"" if the pad is wet, either right after 1 or later. Need to frequently change the pad. I prefer Simple Solutions Quick Dry thin pads. Far superior."
4,much better than WalMart products,"These are much more absorbant than the products we have purchased at the local WalMart, and they are far less expensive."
5,Works!,"Good product. If you have yorkies, you know you need pee pads. My dogs use them and that makes life easier!"
3,$6.97 at Walmart,The pads are sufficent enough. Nothing extra. Thought it was a good deal until I spotted the same exact thing at Walmart for $6.97.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"This is the first time I bought this particular potty pad for my two little dogs.They are very disappointing especially compared toIris 301571 Neat 'n Dry Dog-Training Pads, 17-1/2 by 23-1/2 inches, 50 CountThe filler is not very thick and separates into clumps within the pad before used by the dogs.They may be less expensive per pad but the old adage ""You get what you pay for"" is once againproven to be true."
5,Best of the Best,"This CD is very accessible even to those who have never heard a full concert of bagpipe music before. I was introduced to the instrument through a friend who played. After expressing that I enjoyed listening to him and wanted to hear more, he gave me this CD. I was blown away (pun intended). Gordon Duncan is the Eddie Van Halen of piping. His fast riffs and unbelievable sounds put him in a class all by himself. Angus MacColl is also amazing with his masterful playing.In short, if you don't know anything about piping, this is the place to start, with this CD. If you know everything there is to know about the muisc, then this is also the CD for you."
4,enjoyable,"The plot is quite genuine, something not attempted in Indian films before. Irfan and Juhi are hilarious and share a wonderful chemistry. Both provide the funniest moments of '7.5 Phere'. Juhi Chawla once again with her divine comedic talent shines. This time her funny character has shades of gray. While Irfan Khan plays the slightly weird but likable Manoj with ease.To sum it up, 7.5 Phere is quite enjoyable (for most parts) and I really liked watching the comedic chemistry between Irfan and Juhi."
4,Fascinating but Intense,"This was an intense but fascinating read. Written at the height of the Cold War, there is a strong anti-Soviet sentiment that may be a turn-off for some readers. Some of the details are fascinating -- the items this man thought to stock his nuclear bunker with are just astounding (roller skates? really?) -- while other details related to the human response to a bombing are sensible but sickening. The suspense continues up to nearly the last page -- will the group survive and be rescued, or will they die in their shelter? For those who can handle the psychological baggage of reading about the destruction of the entire northern hemisphere, this is a recommended title."
3,"Nice cover art, but contents are a mixed bag","This isn't a great book, but it's interesting. The super shelter is cool, though it seems unlikely even a very rich man could outdo the military (I used to work in Cheyenne Mountain). The dialog is not great and the characters are kind of cartoon characters and the enemy's strategy is a little bit mustache twirling villain, but it's still entertaining and it ends better than it begins.The parts of the book I like is the ingenuity in finding solutions to hard problems. In a sense a super shelter works against that because you can do just about anything. But with a ridiculous level of nuclear war even the super shelter proves inadequate so they start having to think and that is when it gets better. I could have done without all the phony romance though."
2,Dick Smith Monster Makeup Video,"This is a short, 30 minute, video hosted by monster makeup legend Dick Smith. It seems to be meant as a companion piece to his monster makeup book. He keeps saying that more info is in the booklet that comes with the tape, but I didn't get any booklet. The tape is copyrighted 1989, and seems dated even for then. The demonstration (vampire, zombie) is at a very simple beginner's level. If you want a quick demo to help you do your Halloween makeup, then the price is right. If you want detailed, up to date material, look elsewhere."
3,A mediocre soundtrack to a mediocre movie,"I purchased this CD in hopes that I would be buying an upbeat, peppy album that would get me going in the morning. The soundtrack worked great in the movie, but I didn't enjoy listening to it separately. While the album has its strong points (""Have Fun Go Mad"" by Blair had me bopping every time, and I liked the slower songs by Aimee Mann and Peach Union), the mix just wasn't strong enough. The songs that I'd hoped would be motivating kind of blurred together in an indistinct lump, and the superior songs weren't enough to make this CD a keeper. I'll stick with the Reality Bites soundtrack in the shower - who can resist shampooing to ""My Sharona?"""
5,"Wow! A must-have, any day.","The movie is great; the soundtrack is better. I've turned most of my friends on to this feel-good CD, including my Chilean uncle, while it remains permanently in my stereo. Every song on the album is worthwhile. from Elton John's classic Honky Cat, to Jamiroquoi's funky Use the Force, to Dido's mellow Thank You, the album keeps you groovin' from start to finish. You can't feel bad with an album this good to see you through the day."
2,Its missing something,"I loved the movie so much that I bought it while i still had it rented. I bought the CD with hopes that the theme melody that was played at various moments in the film between Paltrow and her love interest, but it didn't. that would have made the whole CD worth the price, even if it was the only good music. It still has a few good songs, but they are few and not great."
3,"Great, but missing 2 key songs!","I love this cd, I really do... but every time I listen to it I'm disappointed that it's missing both Patty Larkin songs-- Coming Up for Air, which is beautiful and tender, and Tenderness on the Block (which in my opinion is superior to Shawn Colvin's version and especially superior to Zevon/Browne's original versions).To get Coming Up for Air, you have to buy one of Patty Larkin's albums, which isn't that big of a deal.But Tenderness on the Block? Can't be found! I've searched high and low, and I can't find the recording of it anywhere. :(These songs help ""make"" the movie, and without them, the soundtrack is incomplete.Otherwise it's fantastic, including the best Jamiroquai song, Use the Force."
1,Hideously Sentimental ... for the Hypermarket,"This collection of Christmas evergreens is rather uneven. Wolfgang Ruebsam plays four brief organ pieces (a total of seven and a half minutes); a “German Boys’ Choir” (could it be that they didn’t want their true identity to be known?) sings three lovely German carols (a total of eight minutes); and the CSSR State Philharmonic directed by Alfred Walter plays 21 German and Anglo-Saxon carols in the most hideously sentimental orchestration (with added keyboard bass, yuk!!) imaginable. The organ pieces and the boys choir are both very good, respectably recorded. The rest is the kind of thing you would expect to be bombarded with over the poor-quality loudspeakers of an American hypermarket, interrupted by commercials for cereals and soap powder. Lovers of good orchestras and good sound, beware!"
5,yummy,As always these keep you full and are very yummy! I love how they are a denser bar with some crunch. They really do fool you into thinking you are eating a candy bar- I have such a sweet tooth so this is a good thing.
4,"Useful, although misleading and slightly annoying at times","The author definitely sets out what he intends to accomplish, although it may not be what the reader was expecting. Everything in this book is essentially geared toward 2D game development, and covers what used to be called the DirectDraw API. The book is poorly titled, although I'd be more likely to blame the publisher than Walnum himself for that.The tone of the book is very down-to-earth, and it reads fairly easily. It even borders on being patronizing, and the humor reminds me of how I act when there's a girl around that I really, really like--one just gets the feeling that he's trying too hard.All in all, Teach Yourself Game Programming with DirectX is an excellent introduction to the basic features of the former DirectDraw, but anyone wanting to make a remotely modern-looking game will want to look elsewhere, or at least pick up a companion to this book."
3,Good for beginners,"I must say that this book is totally for newbies in DirectX. One who has no idea of anything about DirectX is encouraged to read this book. The sample game used in the book is more or less similar to those old classic 2D game (remember zelda? but it's JBookman).In this book, you learn the basic of setting DirectX application, loading surfaces, textures onto triangles, etc...Like I said if you're a layman in DirectX, you'll be fascinated from what you learn in this book. But you won't learn 3D games here."
4,"Good, Very Good, and Extremely Good.","This book is good for a beginner-intermediate programmer. Don't get it unless you have a solid understanding of C++, Visual C++, and basic Windows programming. The author uses pretty good humour to keep you amused enough to read more. I enjoy reading it.A programmer that is 11 years old that is not the fat soul who climbs in through the chimney on Christmas Eve, but has a good understanding of C++."
4,Hobbyists should enjoy,"This book shows the reader how to create a simple 2D RPG engine. Though it is written in DirectX, the code is easily portable. I actually wrote my own version in SDL with relative ease. Though DirectX is in the title, the book isn't really about DX, it's more about developing 2D RPGs, similar to the classic game Ultima.While there is some technical stuff relating to DX, it's fairly simple and by no means exhaustive. The majority of the book is about building the RPG engine, not DX.I had a great deal of fun building the engine as I progressed through the book, and I'm not even that big on RPGs. My only caution is this: The book is a good book, but it's not for everyone. Someone looking to code the next Quake should wake up and smell the coffee--there's no book out there that can teach you how to become a professional game programmer.Hobbyists should love it, I know I did."
5,Great honest Christian Rock and Praise--Just good music!,"Telecast's ""Beauty of Simplicity"" is a wonderful cd of Christian Rock music. The lyrics are honest, simple and free of Christian cliche and are very adaptable for use in a contemporary music worship service or even just at home. The music itself is fresh unlike so many other Christian rock albums on the market. My favorite songs are ""Beauty of Simplicity"" and ""Radiate."" Their sound is rather brit-pop, most like the music of Travis. If you like Coldplay or Switchfoot's latest, you will like Telecast."
4,Beautiful Pictures....I love this camera!,"I am a 22 year old college student who doesn't have time to learn about all the bells and whistles of digital photography. However, Canon has made picture taking easy without wanting to rip my hair out. This camera is so easy to use, I had it down in about 30 minutes. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a powerful zoom, image stabilization, and most importantly- a beautiful shot. I have had this camera for about 2 months and it has been a pleasure owning it. My only gripe, (along with everyone else's) is the lack of focusing in low light situations. However, this camera does wonderfully outside or in a brightly lit room, shot after shot. I have received compliment after compliment on my photos, and I have never had a photography class in my life! The pictures are always vibrant and crisp (even though it is 3.2 megapixels.) So, if you are looking for an affordable camera with great features- this is the camera for you!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I have had to return two of these. Not sure if the remaining stock is bad, but make sure you put the camera through its paces in the first 30 days so if there is a problem you can return. For the record Amazon has been VERY cooperative with this situation, VERY IMPRESSED with Amazon, Very UNIMPRESSED with the camera-"
4,Great camera but...,"I will be brief. This is a great camera but it does not have the date/time stamp option which I took for granted as being available on all newer digital cameras. My previous camera had it and for me it is a very important feature. After all, we look back on photos for the memories they bring and knowing the date (and/or time) that the picture was taken is VERY important to me."
4,"Great, but devours batteries","Good pictures, lots of features. Really like it, but the batteries cost a lot and only last a month!!!!"
2,Not the best,"Even though this is a Canon camera, it has some flows.- After zomming to long distances, the quality gets lower and its like taking a photo with the digital zoom on even though it is not- Under the low light conditions, the colors are blurry and sometimes worse than my other 2MP camera- it takes forever to take the picture so if you are taking the moving object then you are loosing it while the camera is trying to capture it- so the stabilization is not that helpful since it cannot capture it."
3,"A good, reasonably priced camera","I bought this camera when my daughter was born because I wanted both the zoom feature and the ability to take video clips. The first is impressive, and the second is adequate for my needs - but the included 32MB CF card is a throw-away; even at 320x240 resolution, the camera's AVI format gobbles megabytes fast.The still image quality is pretty good, sharp enough for 8x10 prints. I am a bit disappointed with the auto exposure - flash pictures tend to wash out, and it's not very good in low light. It is also annoyingly slow to auto focus, especially on close-ups, and fails to lock in on many shots. The camera's manual focus feature is too cumbersome to be of any use. A focus ring would be a vast improvement. This is still a very nice camera with an impressive array of features for the price. But if you want professional results, bite the bullet and buy a professional camera."
2,good while it lasted,"This was my 3rd Canon digicam. I was aware that it would not handle low light well (and its idea of low light is my idea of medium, but oh, well....) but was willing to deal with its limitations because of my previous experience with the brand.A year and a half after I bought it, in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Galapagos islands, the flash door popped up and would never shut again. This is annoying, but not impossible to live with. However, since then I have found that the batteries, whether I am using the camera or not, are completely drained in only a few days.Canon charges a huge amount to even send the camera in for diagnosis, making the whole situation cost-prohibitive.Since this model is no longer in production, this posting may be moot. But I do know that I won't be replacing it with the S2...."
4,Just like new!,"We bought the same camera 4 yrs ago when our first daughter was born. Used it like proud parents! We then used it again on our second child and on many many vacations, school events, birthdays, etc. The original camera was sturdy and gave us the best quality pictures we could have ever wanted. Well, it finally broke down and was too expensive to fix. I found a used on on Amazon and was a bit reluctant but for $110, what the heck. I was very pleased with the packaging and quality of the camera. It looks like new and works better than our first camera. Best camera for the money!"
5,Great Camera!,"I bought this camera in 2005 and I still use it as my preferred camera. I also own an Elf Camera by Canon that I love, but the S series is so versatile. I only had to learn a little bit about digital photography to be able to take incredible pictures with this thing. When I bought it, I sacrificed some megapixels in order to get the great zoom and it was well worth it... especially since there's no way I'll ever need a print larger than 11x14. It's easy to use, reliable, and I'm very satisfied with the pictures it takes. The multi-angle LCD screen really comes in handy too."
2,Poor Build Quality,"Decent camera when new - but won't stand up to the years of family events. This is the second Canon Powershot I have owned (different models) - both have suffered maintenance and repair issues even though they were well cared for. Both suffered sticking flash pop-up issues; this one (S1 IS) now has started to tint all images purple. Canon has acknowledged this fault (defective Sony CCD) and has offered to repair same free of charge - turns out this is an effort to get folks to send in their cameras and charge for ""unspecified repairs"". Camera lasted for about 4 years, as did last one.Fool me twice...shame on me...my second Canon product, now my second Canon product with longevity/build quality issues - I won't be buying a Canon again - can't afford to keep buying cameras..."
3,Canon PowerShot not as good as Olympus C-Series,"I purchased this camera mainly because of the Image Stabilization feature. Unfortunately, that is the only feature that this camera has that is better than an Olympus C-Series. I also own a Nikon D1X and find it to be easier to navigate than this camera. This camera does NOT have MACRO mode and it does NOT shoot in RAW format. The product specifications listed on the Amazon site are WRONG. I contacted Canon directly to be sure. The camera gets great shots at max zoom IF it can bring the shot into focus - something that doesn't happen often. I have owned the Olympus C700, C740, C750 and C770. All of them have more features and are easier to navigate. Additionally, I would think a camera of this calibur would use Lithium batteries instead of AA's. Given a choice, I would purchase an Olympus C Series for amateur photography or the Nikon D1X for the professional photographer."
2,large,"large but not too heavy. main problem is slow speed of photo after hitting button. zoom way too fast for me, making middle positions very difficult. good pictures but fast zoom is a big problem and slow picture taking is very poor."
2,Good camera but battery life is very short.,"Overall I am happy with the camera. I prefer optical zoom over megapixels, so it is good combination for me. Pictures are great. Image Stabilizer helps a lot. Video qualify is good too.Its zoom can be annoying sometimes because it makes a noise that gets captured in your video shots. Not a problem for still pictures though.But battery life is pretty bad. If you are planning to buy this camera and would take it on trips, buy lots of NiMh and car charger for them."
4,First Digital Camera,"Great camera for the price. Many options to grow with. Batteries go pretty fast though, rechargebles are a good idea."
4,awesome camera,"Very nice camera. It has good weight and balance in your hand and is user friendly. Whether your a novice or an experienced shutterbug, you should appreciate the range of functions available to get that great shot. Short of an SLR, this is the best camera I've tested."
1,NICE WHILE IT LASTED,"I bought my 1st S1 in September of 2005, and had great luck with it. Took lots and lots of pictures of my foster dogs, and was even able to zoom in on them for close-ups when they were clear out in the corner of the back yard. However, the LCD screen completely 'died' on it after about 10 months. I called Canon and they offered to send me a 'factory refurbished' replacement for only $175.00, which I thought was a good deal. I got the replacement camera, and was very pleased with it, until about 11 months after I got it, the LCD screen quit working on it too. I am now looking at buying a Sony and staying away from Canon!"
1,BAd Camera - Canon Powershot,"No picture has ever shown in the screen, since day one. When I reveived the camera the first thing I did was install the batteries and turned on the camera. I have enough experience to take a picture but all I got were lines and blackness. I asked the seller if I was doing something wrong. All he could say was I had to have dropped it but I did not. The camera has never been dropped. I will never buy third party again."
1,Dead Camera,"I haven't used the camera for a year. I had need of it again so I charged the batteries. It no longer works. I get a purple and white watercolor like wash for an image. After reading some of the problems that people are having with this camera model, I am switching to Nikon rather than taking a chance fixing the camera.I am really dissapointed."
4,Unexpected E16 Error,"This is a great, great camera, but canon should take care seriously about the lens error of the camera after 5000-10000 shots. My camera was replaced at the first time without any question, but 7 years after buying it I had the same problem with the lens and the camera unusable, without a single drop or dust on it. It works only to display images. After checking other reviews, I can see there is a common damage to almost all the S line after a period. I wish I could compare to Sony, Nikon or Panasonic in lens duration."
2,More damage than expected.,"The lens mount trim ring was glued in place making it impossible to add an accessory lens, and possibly making service repairs more costly or impossible. This was not revealed in the description, and cost me shipping both ways to find out."
4,Great!,I took this camera on vacation and it took GREAT pictures. The only flaw with this camera is the small LCD screen.
1,Memory Card Errors Plague the S1 IS,"Powershot S1 IS camera--I was so excited to use it until...time and time again, I have received memory card errors. I bought another memory card, but same results.As another reviewer wrote, ""Even worse, sometimes the camera seems to take a photo, but would then report that it was corrupted, there was a card error, or that the card had no images when attempting to play it back."" The bad thing is that you never know what these problems will occur--sometimes great photos, other times, no photos at all. Argh!The real bummer is that Canon now wants ME to FOOT THE BILL for the repair on their shoddy product. Guess I won't be recommending Canon products to anyone soon... :-( I am awaiting a call from their customer service folks about this issue...Oh and by the way, I have used a Canon at work for several years and have no problems--that's why I went with Canon at home."
3,Big rubbery ears...what are you expecting?,"The ears are pretty much exactly what they look like in the description. My only real complaint is that they don't stay on particularly well. But, for the price they're good enough and they were exactly what I needed for my Halloween costume."
2,A Bike with No Pedals!!!,We were very excited to assemble this bike tonight. The torn apart box foreshadowed what comes next. The bike came with neither pedals nor foot pegs as advertised!!! I ran out to Walmart and bought the last pair of pedals only to find out they don't fit. Christmas morning will come with a bike that my son won't be able to ride and it won't look like the picture either because the pegs are missing too. Customer service is closed; I'm sure until after Christmas. I hope Pacific Cycle is good enough to mail them out overnight when they re-open after Christmas. I'll update this review to let you know if they are...
2,Wouldn't buy again,"This bike didn't last very long. My son was not happy with its handling. The parts wore out way too fast(handle bars, seat hardware, chain, etc). This bike was for my son to get to and from school. I bought it because it seemed like a sturdy bike that wouldn't fail the less than a mile and a half ride to school. He has another bike for the ramps and stunts etc...this bike runs the risk of being stolen so he never rides it to school. They say you get what you pay for but I expected a little better quality than this."
3,"Good Bike, Bad Crank and Pedals","When i recieved my bike, i assemble it and rode it the same day. Well by the end of the day the plastic pedals broke! I went and bought new ones but then the next couple of days the crank grooves for the pedals broke!! I bought a new crank, and another set of pedals!PROS: Looks great; easy to pop a wheelieCONS: Brakes are BAD! The rims are painted = no grip for brakes.; Pedals are bad; handle bars need alot of getting used to; too expensive for this type of quality.Just an honest opinion."
1,Seller tells lies,"This seller is not reliable. I ordered this bike for my son for Christmas. The order stated that it would be delivered between Dec 10 and Dec 15. I called, a week after I ordered, to check the status of my order, because I had not heard from them, and they changed the date to Dec 19. I am hoping that they deliver but the delay and change of date has me worried. The product description says that the bike is ""In Stock"", if this is true what is the delay?"
5,Great Replacement Chairs!,"I needed to replace my two resin chairs for a scheduled event at my home, as wear & tear over two decades - yes, they do last that long - caused an unexpected breakage, which was unrepairable. I did not have the time to visit a known retailer 1 hour's drive from my residence, therefore, it was Amazon.com to the rescue! My beautiful Kettler chairs were delivered in four days, way ahead of the original due date, making my get together at the beach perfect!!! The Kettler product line is durable, long lasting and can withstand the salt water environment of ocean front living. I will continue utilizing them for all my future replacement needs."
5,Awesome Chair,"I have 4 of these at our cottage, which sit on a ""uncovered"" deck. Fold nice and tight up the the cottage when we leave for the week. When they get grubby from the flies, spiders and fall leaves, we just hose them down. Very durable, and well made, they are hard to find in stores anymore, glad Amazon carries them."
5,Just Replacing after 20 Years,After 20 years the resin finally britalized and cracked. Tried repairing by gluing/screwing support under the seat but it didn't work. Looked around for replacement porch furniture and found it was hard to get anything under $700.We're buying 2 new chairs to replace the 2 that broke (after 20 years) and we still have 2 that are going strong (they do not get as much use)
4,A Strange Tale,"This is an award winning book, and rightly so because it is an eerily strange but also very powerful piece of writing. It is a book to make you think, but also one that some people will have mixed feelings about. It is not a story anyone would expect exactly, but it is a wonderful story about escape from abusive relationships, conflict resolution, self discovery and of the love of parents and children.Even if I tried to describe this story I would fail. It is magical, imaginative and so unlike anything else I have written of late that it thoroughly deserves to be better noticed. But the lack of an easy to comprehend plot, and a down to earth conflict will challenge some readers. All I can say is that it really is worth the effort of reading it, so if you are intrigued - buy this book. If you are not intrigued, then at least borrow it from the library and give it a go."
3,Just OK book,"I am aware this book won an award, but I personally did not like it. I am not sure if I will use it in my classroom."
5,A time tested classic resource for parents.,"Gerald Patterson and his colleagues have been researching families and effective parenting practices for well over 20 years. Living with Children gives a clear, concise explanation of reinforcement principles as applied to child behavior management. This book belongs in every parent's resource library along with Your Child's Self-esteem and Why Children Misbehave and What to Do About."
5,This book has been a life-saver.,"This book was recommended by the child psychiatrist that I work with. I bought two copies of it, one for my daughter who is raising 4 children, and one for myself. I highly recommend it."
3,What is this I don't even,"The best way to sum up this movie is that it's MANT and MST3K's unnatural child. It's camp, pure distilled camp, and it's VERY self aware.For example, when the actress is told to ""stop worrying her pretty little head"" about things and go get tea, she does and delivers it with an annoyed comment of ""tea for some chauvinist pigs."" The detective character has Noir detective music playing full time as he narrates, but it's not part of the soundtrack. It's on a huge reel to reel player, and at one point an operator tells him to please turn it down. So he does.And so on. It's probably best compared to Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, in that it's a spoof, it knows it's a spoof, and doesn't try to avoid the fact.Oh. And Bronson Cave. Of Course."
5,funny funny funny!,"A spoof on '50's horror movies, Tony Curtis plays a film-maker who needs a ""flop"" and stumbles across an amateur film-maker with an absolutely hokey cheesy movie. Tony Curtis himself struggles to keep a straight face. Get it an d die laughiong."
3,A pretty good book...,"Although this book is quite expensive, I think it's prettyhelpful. It has some useful tips that have helped me. However, it's alittle boring and excessive in some places..."
2,Awful remastering sound - my ear hurt,"Stay away from this recording. The remastering sound is awful. It does not belong to Decca The Originals series.I have tried adjusting the bass and treble on my pre-amplifier to get a nice sound out of this CD, however, itstill sound awful. The highs so shrill, it hurts my ear and unpleasant to hear.I gave two-star rating for the mediocre performance by Karl Bohm.Better yet, buy Bruckner CDs on Naxos label, conducted by the late Georg Tintner, circa 1999/2000. Or, buy BruckerCDs conducted by the late Gunther Wand on RCA label for a great performance."
4,It's a good house mix with techno tracks,"The mix is good.House music with very hard elements of techno rhythms.For me is that not of problem.The drives of techno in house music are great,but some techno and some house tracks in mix is not good.NYLX,Club69,Superchumbo,House Heros are really great."
2,Tunnelvision,"Using this book is like driving without peripheral vision - you can't take the slightest turn off the single path chosen by the authors. Sure, this book will walk you through making a stateless session bean and deploying it on JBoss. But what if you want to make a client? What if you want to use the Eclipse IDE provided by JBoss? Suddenly, you're left on your own. This book may be helpful to someone making a first pass through J2EE, but if you want to use JBoss for any practical purpose, this book is practically worthless."
2,More a review of how to build a J2EE application than a JBoss book,"If you need a tutorial review of how to put together a web application using J2EE technologies including JSP, servlets, JDBC, Hiberate, EJB, JNDI, JAAS, and web services then you may find this book moderately useful (and if this is what I had bought the book for, I might have given it a slightly higher rating). As for JBoss, yes, it is the application server used in the book to deploy these technologies, but once you have finished the book you will be left with the feeling that you barely learned anything about JBoss itself.Also note that the companion files and scripts you download need a few minor updates to make them work as described in the book (as of December 28, 2005). There is nothing more frustrating than being asked to run an Ant script that is missing the option you are being asked to execute. While this wasn't a showstopper, it is sloppy work and not something one expects from an O'Riley book."
5,My kind of book,"I've built a number of J2EE/Servlet/JSP web applications over the past many years but was never formally trained in OO techiniques nor had any formal Java training. I'm very much a hands on learner and this book fits very well with the way I like to attack things. Some commenters wished for a book more focussed on JBoss particulars but for me the project management stuff and the use of Ant and Xdoclet are a big plus. I ""get things"" best by looking at code and scripts and this book delivers that.I think it's a really swell book."
2,This book is not about JBoss,"From the title and description, I was expecting a book about how JBoss differs from other J2EE application servers either from a developer's or system administrator's perspective. I got neither. This book is really a general J2EE development guide that happens to use JBoss as the example server. It could have been titled ""J2EE Application Development (using JBoss)"". As such, it is not really a complete text on the subject and covers areas in only a superficial way. Any book on J2EE by definition is an expansive endeavor. That said, it could be useful as a companion to a real J2EE book in that this book would provide specifics on how to deploy your example / tutorial applications. Deployment (how to literally deploy the final application) is something that is not standardized in the J2EE spec."
4,Excellent JBoss Guide,"JBoss is an open source application server based in pure Java and it's written for all those Java lovers and users out there in cyberspace. Without many guides and how-to books out on the market, this is a fantastic guide for learning how to use JBoss at your office and use it well!Covering topics such as:Developing web applicationsUsing Hibernate for persistenceWorking with BeansUsing JavaMailSecurity concernsThis book is an extensive (and as the title says) practical look at this exciting technology. For anyone that wants/needs to learn more, you can't miss with this great O'Reilly book.**** RECOMMENDED"
4,I loved it!,I have listened to your music for a while now and really love the blend of your voices. The harmony is fantastic! Also. do you travel much? Do youuse a road band? I would love to play Bass in your group. I am qualified with references and resume available.
2,Creepy,"This book was disappointing. It went on far too long, the hero is pathological, and the heroine is a doormat for putting up with that kind of abusive behavior. Thoroughly disliked both characters. More interesting was a subplot with an American earl named Kerlain. Future book, I suppose."
4,Good,The character were very well developed and I enjoyed the book. But I would have given it 5 stars had the author made the love scenes more romantic and detailed. Lucky is a wonderful hero and the heroine wasn't physically perfect which many other authors tend to do. I loved the fact that he was able to love her for who she was as oppose to what she looked like. Beauty is skin deep!
3,Not Haim or Feldman's Best!,"I watched it and I was shocked at what scenes I seen The Two Corey's in.Especially when you are used to them playing roles as innocent teens trying to get a date.Well lets just say they got more than just a date in this movie.Half of the movie involves Eggert and Haim doing naughty things...Heck there is even a whole montage for it.If you purchase the ""cut"" version it has some of those scenes cut out, but still nothing for the kiddies to watch.Besides all those dirty scenes it has a GREAT plot and story to it.Very exciting and keeps you on the edge of whats going to happen.There is a very interesting twist towards the end.Feldman, Haim & Eggert give amazing performances.But for me it seemed to be something you would watch on ""Lifetime"".It's something I would never watch over and over again."
2,OMG,"This movie is so unintentionally funny, it's ridiculous. Steamy sex scenes, though..I love the Coreys but I couldn't quite figure out why they chose this movie. I have to say the funniest thing about it was watching Corey Feldman dance...trying much to hard to dance like Michael Jackson. Definitely one to watch when you feel like laughing really hard. Love you anyway, Corey Haim!"
3,umm......not one to watch with your mum,"this was an ok film. not a bad story line but it was more like a porno than a corey haim film, if you want a easy going fun movie give this one a miss."
4,not the unrated version,"The title for my review says it all...this IS NOT the unrated version as it is advertised as being but the ""R"" rated one.Not bad but not worth the 5 star rating therefore only a 4."
3,cheesy but not bad,"I saw this movie, and enjoyed it, I've always had a weakness for Corey Haim. It's just an entralling film. Not exactly ""Apollo 13"" but halfway decent."
1,This movie Blows...,I see people giving five star rating for the sole reason of seeing either Nicole or one of the two Corey's nude. Be warned this movie is not good otherwise!!
3,Ok but still want the unrated version,"Hey I love this movie but the 93 minute version is still better. I mean 2 extra minutes of Nicole nude is much better, don't you think?"
3,Sensual and extremely funny,"Eggert plays a spoiled rich girl who wants to get back at her parents for not treating her right. Along comes Haim, who with Corey Feldman who are just looking for fun. Against Feldman's wishes Haim starts up an affair with Eggert and it just gets more steamy as the film goes on. Finally Haim relizes that Feldman is right and decides that he wants to break up, but Eggert is not so willing and decides that if she can't have him no one will."
3,Blown Away,It was good. I remember it differently. It just felt wrong watching it as it could be considered a soft porn with 17 years olds. Not for children under 18 years.
5,Great monitor if you can get a good price,"I bought this monitor about 6 months ago when it was a little more available and priced competitively with 4:3 aspect ratio monitors. Too bad wide screens have not caught on in 17"" size because I love it. The eyes work much better scanning horizontally, and I like the ability to have 2 applications side by side.The colors, brightness and contrast on this monitor are outstanding. Very good resolution on fonts compared with other LCD's in its price range. Speakers are adequeate for web browsing and office application sounds. Form factor is beautiful. And you just can't compare watching a widescreen DVD on a 4:3 with this monitor (although it's actually a 15:9, not a 16:9).Highly recommended if you can get it close to five bills like I did."
4,Haggard's Nada the Lily,"This is another in H. Rider Haggard's African series, although this work does not directly involve Alan Quatermain, it nevertheless fills in the history of Umslopogaas of the People of the Ax, who figures materially in the Quatermain works for example ""She and Alan"". This work is a good read, having much similarity with the other Haggard African novels. There are lots of adventures and several dark villains as well, and the character development brings out that of Galazi, the Wolf, and Mopo, who assumed the role of Umslopogass's father. We also get a better insight into the characters of Chaka, the father of the Zulu's, and Dingaan. If the reader appreciates 19th century adventure novels, this one is sure to please."
3,"A fair rendition, but thats' all...","The American pianist Joseph Banowetz gives a servicable account of these important Franz Liszt piano masterpieces. The overall production of this disc(playing, interpretation, sound engineering)can only be rated as average at best. The big moments in both concertos and the Totentanz fail to make the listener sit-up and take notice. Sure, Banowetz who's recognized internationally for the Romantic literature of piano shows he's most capable. Overall I feel his interpretation is a light-handed one and could use more bite. Liszt being the virtuosic technician that he was, you would think would want sparks to fly. For instructional purposes this disc is OK, but there are at least a few more versions available for about the same price that I'm sure will deliver more."
5,This is an excellent recording for the price,"I also own this piece played by the more famous Misha Dichter, Andre Previn conducting, and the Pittsburgh Symphony orchestra.In all honesty there is nothing to choose between the two of them."
4,Good starting point,"It's a recommended reading for our finance/numerical mth course. I have not got a chance to read through the whole book, but looks to be a good starting point for the subject matter."
4,Good but a little bit superficial,"This is an excellent reference guide to interest rate option models, I used it extensively withImplementing Derivative Models (Wiley Series in Financial Engineering)while I was writing my masters thesis. Although it is a good reference, it lacks deep demonstration of how the equations are derived, throwing a lot of them assuming that the reader is an expert on the field. So in some models the book tends to be too superficial, but as I said it is an excellent reference of IR Option Models."
5,All the Hits,Re-live the sixties with the sound of the folk rock group Mamas and the Papas. You cannot miss with this one.
2,Ouch! What lousy singers!,"Hey, I grew up in the '60s, so I know a few things about the M&Ps.; Their songs were catchy tunes with creative lyrics; too bad their singing ability was absolutely horrible. They had the ability to go a semitone flat at the drop of a hat. I can imagine what must have gone through the head of a musician playing accompaniment either in the studio or at a live event--""Do I try to stay on-key, or should I follow their pitch down?""Want a great example? Listen to ""Monday Monday."" Makes my ears bleed. Makes we want to choke on a sandwich or something."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to having this CD. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in it's content. I consider myself a fan, but there were too many songs that I didn't recognize. The CD was still worthwhile to me, for the songs that I loved those many years ago. Cass's voice is just a joy to hear. My recommendation to you is to read over the song listing before you buy. I evidently didn't pay too much attention to it after seeing the 4-5 songs I knew."
1,I can't believe the Mama's and the Papa's were ever popular.,"I sadly admit that I was a Mama's and Papa's fan when they were popular. However, whenever I listen to a Golden Oldies station, their music really turns me off. I instantly change the station whenever one of their songs come on. Could we have been that musically challenged to make this group popular?"
4,Too much channel separation,"This is a great selection of their best material. All of it appears to be on this CD. Actually the sound quality is very good but I found myself using my equalizer often from one song to another to compensate for the extremely dictinct separation of vocal and instrumental tracks. Sometimes when the channels are balanced equally you hear much more instrumentation than vocals. For an interesting almost acapella version of Creeque Alley, try listeming to it with the right channel turned off."
3,Not quite there,"It's a crime, almost, that this collection overlooks the wonderful ""Straight Shooter"" in favor of several inferior numbers. Otherwise this would be a very fine single-disc collection."
2,The Mamas and The Papas Greatest Hits,About 4 good songs otherwise kind of boring. Mama Cass has an amazing voice!
1,Where is my item?,"Never got my item, went to post office and no one knew about the item or where it is. No option to contact sender about item."
5,"Every song on the disc was a ""favorite""",It is fun to be able to listen to the Mamas & the Papas whenever I want.
2,"FOR LATEST REMASTERING, BUY ""GOLDEN ERA COLLECTION"" INSTEAD","This is an OK compilation, but if you are looking for the most up-to-date mastering of these classic hits, spend the extra dollars and purchase the 2001 2-discAll the Leaves Are Brown: The Golden Era Collectionover this 1998 single-disc package.The vocals are much more up-front in that edition (although this disc is a big improvement over ""Creeque Alley"", which sounds like an old AM radio).""GOLDEN ERA"" also delivers the complete content of TM&TP;'s first four LP's, plus the non-LP single ""Glad To Be Unhappy"".2/06 UPDATE: Universal, in their infinite wisdom, has killed the 52-track ""ERA"" set and replaced it with a 2CD, 33-track ""Gold""-series disc. The audio masters are the same, they just whacked out almost half the songs.Try to find a used ""Era"" disc, either here on Amazon or on ebay: It's worth the search to have the complete M&P; catalog.It's also worth not buying the ""Gold"" set, and lining Universal's pockets, for a sub-standard version."
2,What a disappointment!,"If you are searching for the definitive M&P collection, keep looking... this is not it.This compilation boasts that it is digitally remastered. However, the instrumentals are crisp and sadly to the fore, on most tracks the vocals have been muddied and diminished.. Cass would have not been amused.Regrettably my cassette tape of the M&P purchased in 1969 puts this assemblage to shame."
2,The songs are greats and the CD transfer is not.,"I bought this CD with high expectations and was not disappointed with the quality of the music. The songs are great, but the transfer to CD is not. I'd recommend a remastered recording over this, even if it doesn't contain all their greatest."
4,The best single disc collection.,"I wasn't around when they made this music, but I'm old enough now to appreciate that they did. It's so nice to listen to this when I need a break from the current fads of today. 20 remastered hits on one cd is great. Everything is here from the big hits ""California Dreamin'"" and ""Monday, Monday"", to the favorites ""Go Where You wanna go"" and ""Creeque Alley"". Any fan of ""The Beach Boys"", ""The Byrds"", or even ""ABBA"" should love this. It all sounds as good as ""Michelle Phillips"" looked."
4,A pretty terrific compilation,"Including all of their big and minor hits(remastered)and a nice booklet with photos, gossip and chart information, this Mamas & Papas collection is hard to beat. Perhaps replacing the pretentious ""Dancing Bear"" with ""The In-Crowd"" might've made it better for me, but ""Bear"" was released as a single, so it's necessary for this concept. ""I Saw Her Again"", with it's false start into the third chorus by Denny, is one of the best songs of the era, and Michelle's quotes about Cass being forced to stand atop a piano to record ""Words of Love""(and then dropping the microphone at the end)is priceless. A-"
2,"Another compress re-mastered great album, in only.","Just like a TV commercial only you don't get to go back to the regular programming. It is all loud or if you turn it down to low on the solo singing. Oh, Well. I guess anything re-mastered is a loss today."
5,Quick delivery saved the day.,I was a little slow in ordering a birthday present for my brother. This CD came very quickly...so he was never the wiser. Very much appreciated... p.s. He loves every song on the CD.
2,What was I thinking?,I've listened to this two or three times since purchasing it and never in one sitting. A little bit if this band goes a long way. I've inserted four songs into my digital collection and that seems about right.
3,pretty good,"this group had a few songs that i liked on this set such as California Dreamin',Monday,Monday.they were a cool group for the 60's.but some of this material is filler and should have been trimmed off.pretty good though."
2,The Mamas and the Paps,"While it had almost the hits, the sound quality was so terrible it made the cd almost worthless to listen to. A waste of money! My 45 year old 33&1/3 vinyl sounds better."
5,A Mostly Great Album,This album had all of the songs I was looking for and some that I never heard of before. Well worth the price anyway.
4,Reproduction problems?,"The version of this I have doesn't sound quite right. A bit ""tinny"", I don't know if this is a problem with remastering, or the fact that 60s technology was used for the original recordings. On the good side, there is some great music here: Creeque Alley and California Dreamin are standouts. If I did not already have this on CD, I might consider just buying the MP3 tracks of 4 or 5 songs which are the ones I really like on this. If you are not familiar with The Mamas and The Papas, try listening to some of the samples here, they were a great vocal group."
5,Magnificent and harmonious.,Take a trip back a few years and enjoy the wonderful music and harmoney of one of the greatest singing groups to ever stand before a microphone. Cannot imagine anyone not enjoying the magical sounds emanating from my stereo speakers while listening to these great songs. A great purchase at any price.Don Halasz
4,Perfect collection addition,"Ever since my daughters gave me an IPod, I have been looking for many of the old ""albums"" or artists I listened to growing up. After browsing some sites and comparing selections and reviews I decided on this CD and I am thrilled. My husband, who's musical knowledge is somewhat limited, really likes it too."
4,folk,"if you like the sounds of this era and want the hear some classic folk music, this is great. wouldn't want to miss adding it to your collection."
1,bad remaster,"This compilation is very poorly remastered. The sound is very compressed and strident. there is no bass presence. To hear a glorious remastered sound, listen to ""16 greatest hits from original master tapes"" released in 1985.Remastering can achieve great results. For example, The beatles, stones, who, byrds etc.... all benefitted tremendously over the years with their remastered catalog. The mamas and papas were served extremely well the first time around. Too bad Steve Hoffman didn't work on the subsequent expanded output of mama and papa cds (including the sterile sounding ""all the leaves are brown"")."
1,A major goof,"Obviously ovrlaid low volume vocals with overpowing background music Shame on the peole who put this piece of of er, er, er, junk on the market.May be the same bunch that screwed up the Big O's Platinum Collection."
4,"Great anthology, not crazy about the remastering","What a great sampling of the M's & P's music! But I was hoping for better from the ""remastering"". All the distortions of the original are there, to my ears anyway, and the balance between vocals and instruments seems more heavily weighted towards the instruments, and the ""stereo"" seems limited, with specific parts coming through each channel vs blended ""imaging"". This might be due to what was available on the original master, I suppose, and to be honest, it's been years since I've listened to the original recording."
5,It's a cd,Cd was as expected but they showed that I had received it when I had not. 2nd shipment came pretty fast.
3,disappointed,"Not all songs are sung by THE Mamas and the Papas. I thought I had read it carefully so I wouldn't get stung again... but, guess I was wrong... or my memory of the Mamas and the Papas has faded!"
5,Wonderful music,I loved being able to order any cd online. The Mamas & the Papas greatest hits would be hard to find. I love the cd and it arrived 3 days after I ordered it. It was so easy to do. I wanted to be sure the cd played like it should and was not broken. It was perfect. I love it.
3,Classic harmonics,"After listening to today's CD's, it's hard to go back and listen to that ""one voice in each speaker"" sound of the 60's, but the Mamas and the Papas harmonics are classic oldies, and still sound great."
5,Inspiring book,David Peat excell his ability to explain abstract and complex concepts in this book which surely will help the reader to understand what creativity realy is about. The author masterly summarizes a subject that frequently is approach in more than 400 pages in half that number. The book is exactly what I expected from it.
1,Falling apart already!,"My son got this for a Christmas gift in '08, and the outer zipper compartment has already come unstitched from the case, leaving a gaping hole and rendering said zipper compartment unusable. I sent an email to the Gator Company so we'll see if they stand behind their product.UPDATE: Nov. '09: Never got ANY reply from them. So much for Gator's customer service. I will try once more, but at this point I can't go any lower than 1 star...UPDATE: April '10: Nothing. Wrote to them again, and NOTHING. Go with a different manufacturer who has a functional customer service department."
3,Don't be surprised!,"As another reviewer has already posted, ""Catch the Wind"" and ""Colours"" are not the versions those of us old enough to grow up with this music remember. Listen to them first. As those two songs brought him to our attention, be sure you're satisfied. Adding the new versions as a bonus would have been great in my mind. Replacing the originals completely makes me feel a bit ripped off. Just my two cents worth..."
4,Catholicism and Capitalism Go Together,"Not only is capitalism moral, but Novak proves out how the Catholic church has a history of rejecting socialism and exalting the capitalist society. Contrary to Max Weber's work on the Protestant Ethic, all of Catholicism is not one big tome to social justice and human rights. From _Rerum Novarum_ to _Centesimus Annus_, Catholicism captures the spirit of entrepreneurial ingenuity and liberty."
5,unbelievably chilling,I was just shocked and horrifyed at this womans total domination of her family. I kept hoping someone would come along and help the children. I could not put this book down and was disappointed when i finished the book.
2,there must be another version of this book,"i've read this book a few years back and the focus was on the mother and the children.all these other people came in bits and pieces. i actually got tired of reading the accounts in this book,i kept waiting for the part on the details of the murders not happening, there are 333 pages to this book and it sucks so far i'm at 159. WHERE'S the detective at, thats been waiting on that call. where's the boyfriend of the other daughter that was going to runaway WITH HER,where's the part when she tells her youngest daughter to burn down the apt. all that should be up front all this other suff makes the reader BORED! I'M DISSAPOINTED.ALL THAT MATTERS COMES LATER,IT MAKES THE BOOK BORING YOU JUST WANT TO SKIP TO THE GOOD PART."
3,Evil Does Walk this Earth!,"The horror this ""family"" lived through is almost unimaginable. I watched a talk show program about this case, which prompted me to buy the book. These adult children revealed as honestly as they could the circumstances surrounding the horrendous murders of their two sisters. It is a testimony to Terry's strength that she persisted in getting this story out in the open. I think the author is a great story teller and investigator, however his writing style jumps around a little too much. Never-the-less, I would recommend this book to people who are interested in a Story of Life that is stranger than Fiction."
4,Mother's Day,What a story! Dennis McDougal is a winner in my book.. You will easily become engrossed in this family and the sinister relationship the children have with their mother. My heart really went out to these children. It is a quick read and one you will not likely forget. I know I never will.
2,Too much gore........,"I read this book and found it to be long in what this mother DID to her children, but short on the part that I find interesting about true crime novels - the how and the why. I also would have liked more information on how this woman was finally brought to justice. That part of the story was woefully neglected. To me it was basically a horror story about an extremely sadistic and cruel mother who literally got away with murder for a long, long time.I saw Terry and, I think, the author and the arresting officer on a talk show about a year ago and found that show to be much more interesting and informative than the book."
5,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,"With over 700 books on the Beatles published, you'd think that every photo of the group had been used. Not so, according to Simon Wells' ""Beatles 365 Days"". Inside you'll find an amazing aray of shots that spans the whole history of the group. I particularly liked the ""Middle Years"" photos, most of which seem to be taken by Beatle snapper supreme, Robert Whitaker. The text is excellent, although I would have liked to know more of what's going on, but this is a minor gripe.""Beatles 365 Days"" is a tasty addition to my ever growing shelf of Beatles books."
4,Very pretty presentation,"I like to sit down every once in a while and thumb through picture books, especially of The Beatles. Simon Wells did a pretty good job of selecting previously unseen photos - as opposed to reprinting pictures that have been published thousands of times before but with different captions.Although the price was a bit steep for a book of this nature, it's a good investment nonetheless and Wells's love of The Fab Four comes through with his informative captions.This isn't a must have book for your Beatles library but it would compliment it nicely."
5,"If you're a Beatles fan, it's a MUST-have!","Received it as a gift and it sits on my coffee table (always viewed by guests). I bought it for my stepdad who said ""It's a great toilet book--I read an entry every day."""
2,Leaves me cold,"What is wrong with this recording? I'm not sure. The viola soloist is lovely, the violin soloists are also fine. So are the horns and the recorders. Why don't I love this recording? I think it has to do with a pedestrian approach.The viola concerto is the best thing on this disc. It is engaging Telemann, and is well-performed for the most part. The orchestra accompaniment is pretty vanilla, however. A lack of clarity in the orchestra also hinders some of the joy of the Concerto for 3 violins.I guess if I had to sum up my apathy about this disc, I would say that the blame falls on the shoulders of Edlinger and the orchestra. We have come a long way in Baroque playing, but this seems hopelessly average and old-fashioned (not that older styles of Baroque performances don't have their rewards). Such wonderful music deserves better!"
3,It was OK,"I thought most of it was ok. But then there was parts that looked really fake. Like scenes of the spiders. And one time when The spiders were attacking one of the men, you could SEE him busting one of his blood packsd, so it looked like the blood was from the spiders. I kinda lose interest for a movie when alot of it looks fake. But if it wasn't for that, it would have been a really good movie. So if you don't pay attention to alot of the details, like I do. Then you will think it's a really good movie."
2,Spiders,"this movie sucked, it's not worth the time or the money. Very low budget, a B-Horror movie at the best."
2,Corman should quit while he's ahead....,"The only thing good for this movie is you get lots of cgi spiders and the scenerywith white capped mountains in the background is very nice. Now for the bad news,,whoever did the casting should be fired....there was no interesting charactersbeside 1 or 2 and all the rest are just going through the motions for their paycheck. I blame a lame script, bad acting and other problems. I love monstermovies..even with bad budgets or cheap monsters but this one did not sparkany interest and i was impatiently awaiting for good stuff, but all of a suddenthe movie is ended. Waste of money....Rent !! dont buy...or you'll be stuck witha coaster for your drinks.Not recommended."
4,Edge of your seat,"Great movie, kept me literally on the edge of my seat. Scary - but I had to watch the whole movie. Guess what...no nightmares of huge spiders. You want to be scared, this is a movie for you to view. The spiders were very realistic looking, not mechanical. Watch for more from Patty, played by Diana Terranova she is in the Pandora Experiment coming out later this year."
2,Love cheese,"No F-bombs,sex, or nudity? Are you sure this is a Corman movie? Whatever... The only reason I got this is because an old college classmate--Michael Swan--is in it. (He's better than this SyFy Channel crap he's been doing lately). Oh, I mustn't forget the obligatory ""Wilhelm Yell!"" Speaking of sounds, I haven't heard beast screams like theirs since the 1960's ep of Outer Limits called ""The Zanti Misfits."""
1,not a documentary,This what I thought it might be a documentary from the Middle East and about the camel spider. It presents itself as a horror movie which it is far from. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!
4,A mere drop in the trough................,"By chronologically listing the tracks, the ""feel"" of the original tracklisting is sabotaged. I am not saying that the inclusions of ""Time is Passing"", ""Young Man Blues"" hurt the album--NO,NO,NO. These songs actually help show what path The Who were taking at that moment in Rock History. Perhaps this is the reason for the chronological listing.I would have preferred that the Original tracklist to be kept intact, with an inclusion of all the Bonus tracks--(Outtakes and B-sides)on a Second Disc.The title, ODDS & SODS fits perfectly."
4,It is better than the original Odds and Sods?,"Just a few thoughts on this expanded, remixed and remastered edition of Odds and Sods.First, I'm a Who fan, so I'm going to be happy with whatever ""bonus"" or previously unreleased material they put out. That said, there are several things to consider. First, there is material here that has already been issued in the Who's reissue series, and other cuts, like John Entwhistle penned b-sides, Circles (a BIG omission), etc., that are not here. Second, some of the remix/remaster choices are suspect. What happen to Under My Thumb? And what about the distortion on the high end in Summertime Blues? Also, if you want to hear how good Pure and Easy and Long Live Rock can sound, you'll have to buy the box set, because the overall sound is much smoother and more natural there.I'm happy to have the material, but of all the Who's expanded reissue series, this is the one I would most question as to it being as good as it could have been."
5,Great replacement for vinyl...,"I purchased this CD to replace my album, and I was quite pleased with the extended play list! There are quite a few additional songs on the CD!"
5,Carr truck step,"The Carr brand truck step is a great accessory for Dodge ram pickups. I installed the wide Super Hoop XM3 steps in about 2.5 hours. The polished aluminum steps are very well made and look great on my ram pickup. Climbing in the 4x4 ram pickup is easy for my family now that we have added the steps. Installed steps are about as high off the ground as the skid plate, and don,t extend out any farther than the body line. Great product from Carr!"
1,I hated this movie,I hated this movie. It was horribly perverted and left me feeling victimized. This was not a responsible way to handle the subject of child prostitution or slavery.
5,Beyond the Sixth Game,"I have been a die hard Red Sox fan for 60 years but I grew up in the west were news of the Sox was scarce at best. This book answered so many questions. A must read for any body that truly lived and died with the Boston Red Sox.John Gaskill Carson City, Nevada"
3,Love the Title Song,"I love the title song and several of the songs on this CD, but not as good as I thought it would be..Shout to the Lord is great and so just for that I am still glad I have this CD."
5,Bang Bang Bang from NGDB is well worth the wait!,"I loved most of the cuts on the album, which is much more country-sounding album than their last (non-Christmas) effort, Acoustic. I notice that only one of the songs was written by a band member, The Monkey Song, by Ibby, again, unlike Acoustic where all but one of the songs was written by or collaborated on by one of the band. I especially loved ""If This Ain't Love"" and ""Bang Bang Bang"" for the uptempo beat, and found ""Down the Road"" and ""Singing to the Scarecrow"" very touching, along the same lines as ""Dance Little Jean"". ""Dry Town"" and ""The Monkey Song"" are a lot of fun. I missed having a cut or two featuring Bob Carpenter on lead vocals as most of their albums have. Overall, however, the Dirt Band has never sounded better and it was well worth the wait. Keep up the great Dirt!"
5,"It's been a long time coming, but well worth the wait.","This CD calls out for a hit in many ways. It's loaded with surprises not seen by NGDB in 7 years, since Not Fade Away. The Title track is a perfect party song, Forget the Job (Get a Life) is something we all need to consider. Dry Town is a classic sound with washboard, Mandolin, and Accordion. Jimmie Fadden is in rare form on ""Southbound Train"". Jeff hanna sings with wife, Matraca Berg in ""It's About Time"". ""The Monkey Song"" is a upbeat, fun song which is the only self-penned song on the album. All in all, it's got what it takes to make it big."
5,Excellent Workout for those up for the Challenge!!!!,"This workout was excellent. I did this video with ankle weights and burned more than 400 calories in 40 minutes. It is much faster than your average firm workouts. I don't think this a good video for beginners or those who are new to The Firm. I was surprised at how fast paced it was from the very beginning. However, once I got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing. I also think people should watch the video first before attempting. Most firm workouts that go for an hour or more is something that one should build up to. I just had a baby a few months ago and getting back into shape. I did more basic firm workouts for about a week before attempting this workout. I have done this workout twice so far and I believe it will be one of my favorites!!"
4,Get Ready to Work It!!!,"I love the Firm series, which is the reason why I bought this one--I needed to try out some new routines, but I wanted to stick to the Firm because of their quality. I was a bit skeptical from the title and the ability to reach that many calories, all w/o using the Fanny Lifter, but get ready, because this is non-stop from start to end. I loved it! Some of the routines left me tangled up and a bit frustrated, but hey--it was my first time doing the workout, so I'm confident it will become easier after multiple tries. Overall, I loved the new challenges and some of the routines I had never done before with weights. I also really liked Kelsie Daniels and will be looking for add'l workouts with her. Great video!"
2,"Seems to be a calorie burner, but THE MUSIC...AAAGH!","Ms. Daniels seems to have some great, creative moves but the lack of cuing while jumping right to a move that should probably be explained coupled with her utter lack of synchronicity to the music makes it unbearable for me.I just got Dangerous Curves Ahead and I love it!"
2,Terrible cueing,"I have a number of the firms dvds and have been using them for two years with great results. Bought this thinking I would step it up a notch but, the cueing is so bad you end up stopping to say WHAT!! The most disconcerting thing is that the steps are off the beat of the music and that drove me crazy. It's a tough workout if you can get in your own groove but I find myself using this the least of all the Firms workouts."
5,Music was insync to me,I enjoyed this dvd and it was challening. I was able to keep step with the music. If one has trouble keeping rhythm to a beat then it would be difficult for them to keep up with the music. I worked up a sweat and would recommend this workout. I did not feel the music and movements were out of sync.
3,Decent workout but lots of moves are not safe!,"I have been a fan of The Firm tapes for years and this has to be one of the worst ones. You get a decent workout -- but as many other people have said, the cueing is BAD. Plus several of the moves are just plain NOT safe. I'm a certified personal trainer and have done aerobics for years, so I'm pretty experienced at saying this -- the lunges with a twist is just not good for your knees. Plus some of the moves with weights could definitely hurt you if you are using a heavy weight. I normally work out using 10 - 20 pound weights and could only use 5 pound weights for most of the video because of the speed and number of reps. Not sure why she kept saying to use ""medium to heavy weights"". Overall just very disappointed that The Firm would put out such a poorly put together video."
2,"Instructor not on the beat of the music, annoying","I used to teach aerobics a long time ago, and am just getting back into it. I have about a dozen FIRM dvds.I bought this one based on overall review. It drove me crazy that she wasn't starting a sequence on the first beat of the typical 4-beat length of music! When I got certified to teach, that was one thing that the instructors taught us, to start on the first beat, and switch after the fourth beat. I try to do her moves, only on the correct beat, but it's not fun. Would not reco."
1,A Waste of money.,Did not like this workout. By the time i was doing one move Kelsie was doing another. Should have been more simple to follow. I was very frustrated and shut it off in 5 minutes!! Don't waste your time with this video.
3,Okay workout,"I think this is a good buy for the money. I felt like it was challenging enough but I doubt I burned even close to 500 calories. Also, in regards to this video, I have the same argument that I have with all the Firm workouts-the cueing is bad and transition are too fast which can eventually lead to injury."
2,"I've come to the conclusion...I don't like ""The Firm""!","I work at a public library, so have access to hundreds of exercise DVDs. I've recently tried 4 or 5 ""The Firm"" DVDs and I don't really like them. This DVD had me sweating by the end, I'll give it that. But all ""Firm"" DVDs suffer from the same flaws....too chaotic, the moves are too complicated with not enough repetition/cuing. I find I'm flailing all over the place trying to keep up with the choreography. Personally, I don't want to have to mentally concentrate that hard when I'm exercising. For those of you who want a really efficient work-out that burns calories/carbs & gives you results....try Jillian Michaels, Jari Love, or ""Results Fitness in 10 days"""
2,Too fast and confusing,That's nice that you can burn 500 calories with this workout but the routines are too confusing and she don't give you time to learn the moves before she starts a new one. Waste of my money!
3,Not for the Uncoordinated!,"As a trainer, I thought Kelsie was very good. She had unlimited energy and was very motivational. That being said, I borrowed this DVD from a friend, and I have to say, I'm not the least coordinated person ever, but this was a little ridiculous. I know a lot of workout DVDs have dance and complicated exercise sequences, but until you figure out what Kelsie's doing, it's on to the the next exercise. I didn't even feel like I was getting much out of it at first because I had to start and stop so often. I'm not a beginner exerciser, so I can imagine how the beginners feel trying to keep up with this one. The DVD claims visible results in ten workouts, and I think it probably takes that long to figure out what's going on with each exercise. Overall, I'll stick with my 30-Day Shred by Jillians Michaels. The moves are easy to follow, but extremely effective."
2,the steps are hard to follow..,steps of this video are complicated it is hard to follow. I only played it onced for about 15-20 mins.
4,definitely a good workout!,"i actually bought this dvd at wal-mart on clearance for $1.80. when i got home and tried it the first day, the steps were so confusing and unexplained that i quit in 5 minutes. a few days later, i thought i'd give it another shot, and was definitely surprised at how hard of a workout this is. i still occasionally struggle with the steps, especially because kelsie hardly takes a break to teach you how to do the steps, but there is a lot of repetition, so in time, you get the hang of it. plus, i realized, even if i am doing some of the cardio wrong, whatever i'm doing is still giving me a great workout! i come out sweating everytime...sweating way more than an hour at the gym. this is a great dvd that i suggest you should buy...it is inexpensive compared to many comparable workout dvds. the only thing that bugs me a little is that there are so many lunges and squats for your legs, but not very much ab work at all. other than that, i've been pretty satisfied with it."
2,spastic...,"I got about 5 minutes into this video before I realized it wasn't for me. She is so spastic and it drove me NUTS! I didn't have time to learn what move she was doing before she moved onto the next one. I might have to just watch it several times to learn it but her whole style is just off and annoying to me. I appreciate the quickness of the dvd but not everyone knows the moves right away so when you do the move twice and move on to the next one, you really don't get a chance to do anything at all and it just seems like a big waste of time. Maybe my rating will change once I get it down. I tried to take it back to Walmart and I couldn't so I'm stuck with it. Hopefully it will get better in time."
3,On the fence,"I am still undecided about this one. I don't really like Kelsie Daniels but the workout was decent. She was not very informative on which leg she was using, etc. Also, I consider myself pretty coordinated and am a fast learner when it comes to dancing and choreography but I had to do certain cardio sections a few times to figure out exactly what she was doing. It was all over the place."
4,500 Burn,"This DVD workout is Awesome. I enjoyed the instructor's energy. The video was very fast paced and hard to keep up with, but I guess it would have to be in order to burn 500 calories."
5,I LOVE this DVD!!,"I love the Firm workouts in general. I was a bit hesitant to try this one out, as I wasn't familiar at all with the instructor Kelsie. Needing a new routine, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt one day and boy am I glad I did! The moves are easy to follow, the music used for the cardio segments is great. It incorporates upper and lower body with light weights, there are punches, jabs, hooks, uppercuts, lunges and squats and Kelsie's instructions are right on cue...I sweat like crazy (which I love) and I feel the workout deep in the muscles. Over all I LOVE this DVD!!!"
4,Good overall workout,"I own 8 different FIRM DVDs and I have to say that this one is my least favorite. Other reviewers complained about the steps being off the beat, and they are all right! The video goes back and forth from strength training to cardio and at least the first 3 cardio sections are totally off beat. It's very hard to follow when there's no relation from the steps to the music. The cues are also too late to figure out what's next. I'm sure that won't be a problem after I go through the DVD a few more times. I did get a good workout though!!!!!! I'll work this into my DVD rotation, but because of the off beat issue...I had to take off 1 star."
2,"Confusing, unsafe","The aerobic parts of this workout go so fast, and the music is badly cued with the instructor's voice. You'll see even the back-up girls have a hard time keeping up.I really question who would let this kind of DVD even hit the market. It is so poorly done, and the reps on a lot of the strength exercises are so fast there is no way anyone could do the exercise effectively or properly. A lot of the moves also seem dangerous, flinging around weights in jerky motions."
2,Not for the uncoordinated,"I love The Firm and have used the DVDS for years. This would be a really fun workout if you're super coordinated but I am not. There was not enough warning or explanation when the moves were going to be changed and the moves changed so quickly I could not keep up. I got really frustrated and quit after the first 20 minutes. I did like the excercises that required weights, though."
5,Fantastic - worth the money,I love this workout. The pace is fast but after a couple times through (like any new workout) the steps are fun and challenging.
4,I love this workout!!,"At first I was quite intimidated by the idea of doing a full hour workout claiming to help you burn 500 calories, but once i did some of the routines it became easier, especially with the modified versions you can do. The cueing was off a bit but aside from that the more you do this workout the better you get! Just be careful when first starting out and don't do injury to your knees; take yout time and you will get the moves eventually. I found it challenged me to see if I have what it takes to get the next level of fitness, and I found that I do! I highly recommend this workout!"
1,too fast!! catered to fitness experts rather than normal people just trying to lose weight!!,"this workout may burn 500 calories, but i couldnt get through the first minute of it. they claim that this workout is ok for beginners, even those new to exercise, and to watch one of the girls for beginner modifications. hah! the camera doesnt even pan to her or anyone long enough to figure out what's going on. and that's not the worst of it. Kelsie assumes we already know all these moves, she goes way too fast, not telling you to change a move until she's already doing this new move!!! plus she switches moves every beat. these moves/steps are nothing new. They're straight from any Kathy Smith video or Slim in 6, which give you the same intensity of workout while demonstrating the moves at pace that is meant for a person trying to lose weight not an exercise professional or personal trainer. RIDICULOUS!!!"
3,The music is maddening,"While I generally liked the strength and cardio routines on this new workout, the music is often annoyingly out of sinc with the rhythms of the movements. While it could be that the music was added in a very sloppy edit after the fact, I am certain that the instructer herself jumped off tempo several times, even occasionally skipping over a half a beat here and there...just enough to trip up the defenseless exercisor at home. I almost quit a couple of times out of frustration, but never quite gave up. Honestly, this would be a 5 star review were it not for this sub-standard element."
3,Not my favorite,"This video is a killer. Normally I enjoy a challenge but this one just makes me aggravated. The aerobics exercise steps are a little complicated and I spend more time trying to figure out which arm goes with which leg. If you are all about simple, this is not for you."
1,No instruction,"I found this workout to be very confusing. I am very coordinated, and have been back into exercising for nearly 5 months now so these factors have nothing to do with my review. I bought it with the intention of moving on to a more challenging workout, but what I got was one that was impossible. Kelsie does not explain what she is doing and moves from movement to movement under the assumption that you know what her terminology means. I HATED this dvd and would not recommend it to anyone. I probably won't purchase any firm product at all, I was very disappointed."
2,must be very coordinated,"This is my first Firm video so I assume most videos are like this one. I personally find it very hard to follow all the steps. She goes so fast that by the time I figure out what she's doing, she's on to something else. I prefer something a little slower that focuses on form rather than coordination. She doesn't focus much on making sure you're doing it right. I always though I had decent coordination but perhaps not! I also find the instructor super annoying. I can't stand the way she talks and doesn't speak in complete sentences. I feel like she's trying to prove something. After doing this 4 times I don't find it any easier to follow. That being said, the video defenitly makes me sweat and I still feel I'm getting a good workout despite my frusterations."
3,"Decent aerobic workout, not quite 500 calories","I have done a lot of Firm workouts, and as far as they go, this one is pretty high intensity. That being said, it doesn't give everyone a 500 calorie burn.I've done it several times with my heart rate monitor on, and I average about 350 calories at best, using 8 lb. dumbbells (a lot more than what they use in the video). You're only going to get to 500 if you are heavier or not used to this kind of workout. the amount of weight used isn't enough to build muscle, it only increases the calorie burn.After four times, I'm done with this video, I'd rather burn 350 calories jogging outside."
1,"If you're not into Step Class, avoid this DVD!","I don't know anything about the Firm, and when I read reviews of this video before I bought it, I saw nothing to indicate that this video was a step routine that assumes you've been in step class your entire life. Maybe it does burn 500(+) calories, but if you can't get the routine down, you won't be burning that much. I tried a few times, but she changes moves SO fast and if you're like me and not very coordinated (and step routines give you trouble) I would avoid this video. I have been doing a Jillian Michaels video, and I find it challenging- and it doesn't require such ridiculous coordination. Apologies to everyone who loves this video... I wish I could be that coordinated!"
4,Almost perfect in my opinion,"There are a few glaring bugs in this game that the developers are trying to fix, but I'm afraid its too little too late. I'm a bigtime strategy fan, including turn based. I've played games like Disciples 2, and found that even though this game was totally different than what I was used to, I found it to be very fun. I would say to wait for a combo deal with this and the addon, or see if they are put in the same package, because the addon really completes this game (in the sense that it seems a little half baked)Bottom line: If you like strategy specifically, then get this, if you're a casual gamer, then do your homework reading reviews and such to see if this is a game you really want."
3,Heroes V,"Impressive, but I am not impressed. My system either meets or exceeds the minimum requirements on the box, but I had to turn off the music and sound just to make it playable. 5 minutes to load a saved game. About the same to exit to the desktop.I have played Heroes I thru III and saw steady improvement. V is awesome for its 3-D graphics, but unless you have a really high end PC, yoo had better be patient. Lack of single player maps or a map editor is a real drawback. even the first patch does not include the map editor, but it is over 50 MB just for bugs, real or perceived. the patch will also not download in multiple sessions with Download Manager. It all has to come in one session.it's too bad this one got through Beta testing the way it is. it feels more like UBISoft shipped the Beta version."
1,Short Review from long time HOMM Fan,"I've been playing the Heroes series from I to III. I didn't bother with IV because it had poor reviews and looks terrible.This game is all graphics. It plays painfully slow, and requires you to move the camera around to see anything. The units are cool, but they all have abilities that will take forever to remember what they do. The game comes only with a handful (literally) of maps that only one or two allow you to play the faction of your choice.The combat is the same as Heroes III mostly, though heroes can fight too. It's actually one of the good things of the game.If you want to play a map on HOMM V, expect to spend a few hours as it seems to take forever to play. Oh, you better have a good graphics card and lots o'RAM, cause this game is a resource hog."
4,HEROESV!,"Heroes of Might and Magic is the Fifth installment in the Heroes of Might and Magic, Dungeons and Dragons style saga...originally coined and designed by now defunct software and gaming company 3DO, Ubisoft has picked up and rolled with the Heroes concept. Now, Heroes V, which would be second only to the brilliant; and quicker paced Heroes III, adds splendid graphic sequences, fluid game-play, and incredibly addicting and challenging campaigns. The first person style attack from your main controllable warrior is a nice twist previously unavailable in earlier installments. The challenge in this game is souping up your cities, armies and spreading quickly over the map before the AI, which plays very skillfully!I would highly recommend this game !moulonmike"
2,If you're a fan of the older Heroes this probably isn't for you.,"As a HUGE fan of Heroes I, II, III and even IV, Heroes V came as a big disapointment to me. For one there is no autosave which was great with the others. The game had great graphics with the factions but I wasn't too thrilled about the creature graphics. I have a big problem about creatures that aren't proportionate. It's ridiculous to have arms and legs that are twice as large as you torso or hands that are bigger than your body. I know this is fantasy but come on. There were also very few maps; hardly enough maps to put out on a game. Overall, I hate the game. If the other Heroes had played like this I would have never have liked them and I've been playing them for 10 years."
3,Heroes of Might & Magic 5,This game was good until the updates came.If you do not know the Might and Magic system it will be hard to play.
4,Great!,"Most of the negative reviews I've seen note compatibility problems. I have had none. About the only issues I've had is that I tried to install the US 1.1 Patch, not realizing I had bought a Euro version. However, all I had to do was locate the Euro patch and it installed fine. BTW, my computer was high-end about 3 years ago, but I run everything at the highest level and have NO slow-down.Now for my review:(1) At first the 3-D switch bothered me, but it's grown on me. Overall I think it's an improvement over previous incarnations. However, I think this will vary by taste.(2) I don't like how it's hard to see the beautiful details of your units during battle. You have to move the camera back so far to see everything that you miss those details. This is a minor complaint, but...(3) The game is very much like previous HOMM games, with an overall improvement in graphics and GUI.I am quite happy with my purchase."
3,Not happy.,"I got the game along with the expansion. After downloading all the patches and actually playing the game I realized the RGMs seems less customizable than in HOMM III. Also, the loading time between turns is stupidly long. In the other HOMM's on your first turn the AI turn was almost instant...in HOMM 5 it took almost 60 seconds...for the FIRST turn. I wasn't happy. Also, the camera controls didn't impress me either.Positives: Graphics are cool, voices aren't bad, cool new features.I ended up sending it back."
4,Good and Bad,"I'm a long-time fan of HOMM, having thoroughly played all 4 prior versions. It has always been one of my favorite games.Version 5 stays true to the franchise. As other reviewers noted, it builds off of 3 more than 4, but it definitely adds new elements and higher strategic complication to give it parallels to 4.The 3D graphics are very cool, but the new system demands can be frustrating. My computer meets the requirements, but the wait time for game saves and loads can be pretty tedious and prolongs and interrupts the time spent playing the game.I still recommend it, but want others to be forewarned."
4,HoM&M V,"Good overall game. It's fun to have some guys over to play, and you can play xbox while other people take their turns. I am not really a fan of RTS games though."
2,"Great game, poor support","The game is great.However, the installation limitations on the game are not great. I had 4 harddrives crash on me (in quick succession). So, being extremely frustrated at certain manufacturers I was looking forward to some R&R; with the game. However, they have a limit on the amount of times it can be installed. And their support is no good.Buy the game - just not using download."
4,Strong continuation of M&M,"I am a big fan M&M and had mixed feeling when I first got this game. The game follows all the good traditions and is very balanced. It is missing something, but I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe I am just so used to the older M&Ms. Although this game is older, watch the graphics requirements - they bite and the game did not ran well for me on minimum requirements. Hours of fun to do individual missions, and the quests are well done too."
1,"It go crash, then call microsoft for error",couldn't get this to work on either my new system or my old system.Went crashola. Then it offered to send a bug report to microsoft.I want my money back!
2,NOT FOR LAPTOP,Please check carefully the specs before buying. Not for integrated video card. The grahpic maker for the game sucks.
4,Disappointed,"Now that the game is running I like it.I had to upgrade my computer to make it work, very disappointing!Game seems to be missing some elements that they say are coming on the first patch.I recommend waiting!"
1,Shouldn't graphics get better??,"I have been a big fan of all the Heroes games. I came in at II, LOVED III and thought there were some good improvements with IV....And then came V. I was really hoping for better graphics and it almost looks like a lot of detail was lost in making this a ""3D"" game. The graphics actually look worse then the previous games. The creatures are less detailed and look more cartoon like. The towns look poor as well. I don't see any improvements in this new version. I only see a big disappointment."
2,What's with the lag?,"The game is beautiful, the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is very interesting. However, there is a neverending lag. My computer exceeds the game requirements and i don't know where the lag is coming from. The game would've been great if it wasn't for the lag."
2,Game is way too slow with addition of 3D views,argh... I love HOMM series and played every one of them. Also played the entire series of Age of Wonders.Heroes 5 has got to be the worst possible candidate to have 3D worldview. I kept moving around trying to click the heroe to touch an object of interest and missing it because the damn 3D view is never accurate. And it runs slow as a turtle on my Dell 8600 notebook.My recommendation is to skip it. The 3D worldview is as useless as it gets and Ubisoft does not get it for some reason. They also made Scrabble 3D and it is so damn slow and crappy that I rather play a free version with nothing more than lines and letters than their version. Stuff like that just boggles the mind. Why make something so pretty and but unplayable and adds no value?SKIP this game and get Age of Wonders or whatever else is out there. Maybe Ubisoft will finally get it right one of these days.
2,good intentions but didn't deliver,"this game was appearantly rushed out,i have a fairly new dell that i ordered especially for gaming and before i could play the game,i had to install 3 patches before the game would run,the game freezes when you try and save it before battles,when your in the city and trying to move troops from the garrison to your army,frankly it is a royal pain,you putan army group over a block in your army and it takes forever to place them in,the game has excellent graphics but i was disappointed when you enter the cloud city is darkened out,to the graphics and new presentation of a great game was wasted in poor execution"
4,4 stars on its way to 5,"To all the people that diss HOMM5 because it won't run on their system: read the system requirements for chrissakes! If you want to play HOMM5 you should at least have the recommended system specs, not just the required. This is a very common situation in all the modern 3D games.That said, gameplay, graphics and sound are great in HOMM5 and I recommend it highly. The only worthwhile cut is it that it did not come with the map editor"
2,Slow,This is easy to install but slow to run. I have a pretty decent machine I got in 2006 but this thing just runs in molasses. I really don't get why they make something so slow that it is unusable? My advice is not to waste your money.
4,The game that i was expecting when i bought HoMM4,"If you loved HoMM3 and thought that HoMM4 was a flop, you will not be disappointed in HoMM5. The artwork is phenominal. The animation is solid. The implmentation of a 3d engine is near perfect. The game play is wonderful. Then i got to the story. The diologue in the cut scenes made me want to cry and vomit at the same time. The only other thing that erked me was that it did not come with a random level generator, but my suspicion is that they were not finished with it when it was released. The expasion, which is sitting next to me, but not installed comes with a random map generator.So to summerize, if you are looking for a gripping story with deep character development, and an intellegent plot, don't even consider this game. However, if you love turn based stratagy games, or HoMM 1 through 3 (and maybe some people liked HoMM4) prepare your self. Be aware (at least to my knowlage) you will have to buy the expasion to get the random map generator."
2,Disappointing,"Was hopeful and perhaps deceived by some of the very good cinematics that came out before game release.A legitimate effort was made to implement at least partial 3d while preserving an impressive level of details. However, overall graphics are very awkard, a bit bulky, characters out of proportion. Finding puzzles locations can become ridiculously difficult to locate. Initially liked the impressive towns graphics but quickly becomes cumbersome.Story a bit weak. Music is as always very good. Overall reduction in fun vs heroes 3 and 4."
3,Not heroes 4 or 3,"This game decided to focus too much on graphics rather than game play. Those people who played and enjoyed heroes 4 or 3 will be sorely disappointed at the game play in this game. The over the top view has changed and in some cases the more 3d look causes frame rate issues that were not caused by my computer's capabilities. Also, for those people who loved the ability to move your character in 3, this is not a feature."
5,Beautiful,"This cross stitch kit lives up to all of Dimensions' kits. The thread comes pre-sorted and they usually give you plenty. The one time I needed an extra strand or two they sent me the correct colors quickly and at no charge. The patterns are easy to use and clear, but not the easiest and probably best for people who have done some cross stitch before. Beginners may find themselves over their heads."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed that Olivia Newton-John's song ""Please, Mr. Please"" was not included in this soundtrack. I was hoping it would be even though Olivia's other song, ""Over the Rainbow"" wasn't included in the Face/Off soundtrack either. Oh well, otherwise it is a fair soundtrack, after all the movie was excellent."
2,missing song?,"There was a song in the movie, I can't remember exact point, but it sounded like Lisa Gerrard. Can anyone back me up on this?email me @ blaza6925@yahoo.com"
5,excellent adventure thriller,"A friend recently presented me with a copy of Barbara Sofer's novel, THE THIRTEENTH HOUR, in appreciation for a number of books I had recently lent him. I had never heard of either the book or Ms. Sofer and thought that in reality i would never read this work. Yet this past weekend I picked it up and started to read it, and had difficulty in putting it down. The author's tale of middle east terrorism, espionage, intellegence, violence and counter intellegence is amazing. Her characters are well developed and pretty believeable.I was particularly drawn to her main sub plot the failed marriage of Deborah the american researcher in Israel , caught in a web of intrigue. Her depiction of the Ultra Orthodox life in Israel is excellent and on target, although I wish that this sub plot would have been developed some more. The last 70 pages were action packed and filled withb unexpected events. I eagerly await more thrillers by Ms. Sofer and a movie version of this novel."
5,"Riveting, very fast paced!","Isn't it amazing how people either think this is a #1 Action/Thriller, or trash? I couldn't put it down, had to finish it in one reading. Politics aside, it is a riveting, intelligent novel. Barbara Sofer knows her stuff."
1,Disturbing imbalance of Arab Jew presentation.,"I am surprised by the reviews that see this book as a fair presentaion of the situation between Israel and Palestine. It is so obviously and overwhelmingly slanted in favor of Israel in its sympathies that I could not recommend it. The reasons behind the 'vicious militance' of Islamist Palestinians is never fleshed out in any fair way. A few references here and there but - and I am only part way though the book and reading it only to see if it EVER becomes more objective - the usual cliches are employed (i.e. Islam encourages killing of all infidels) and the Islamists are seen as cruel and evil, killing even their own people. Oh yes, the author occasionally mentions a few evil Israeli deeds, such as Deir Yassin) but without explanation. For a more honest appraisal of the I/P situation, read Yehoshua's ""The Lover"" or David Grossman's ""Yellow Wind""."
2,"""Harlequin Romance"" in guise of a spy novel","The fact that I was more interested in the subplot about the developing romance between Deborah and Raffi says alot about the believablity of the main plot. Deborah, the American-born superwoman, was constantly getting herself into life and death predicaments where she would be rescued by big strong Israelli Raffi (Steve Austin to her Lindsey Wagner). Raba, Palistinian-born American living in Israel, so timid and weak that she barely has an opinion of her own but has no trouble resorting to stereotypical Arab behavior when pressed. Both female protagonists as well as the plot lacked crediblilty. However, if you are a woman who fantasizes about being rescued by a big, strong, handsome man this book may be for you."
1,The author needs a copy of Strunk & White,"They're the authors of ""The Elements of Style"", for those of you who don't know. And boy, does this author need it. The writing is stiff and the plot is straight out of a combined Harlequin romance and Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.I've read better ""Dick & Jane"" books."
1,Not compatible with Motorola RAZR V3xx,"Wish I had seen review of the person who said that ""Not compatible with Motorola RAZR V3xx"" because he is correct it is not. The product comes up when you search for the Motorola RAZR V3."
2,Too sweet!,"This brownie mix is too sweet it's so rich and chocolaty that it's sickning when they say chocolate extreme they mean it , i wouldnt wanna get it again."
5,Spectacular!!!!!,"This book should be a movie and I would see it a hundred times in a row. It has so many good characters and a great mystery plot that keeps building and you don't know how it will end until the very, very end--then you say, oh yeah!! I really loved this book. It was perfect."
3,a good baseball collectors book,The book I read was The Boy who Saved Baseball. I really liked this book. This book was about a boy that rides into town and claims to know the secret to a famous baseball player that never told anyone. This is all happening while a single baseball game is depending on the survival of the town. The whole town depends on one single baseball game.I really liked this book because I thought it had suspense. It was a very good book. I like the author of this book a lot because he was descriptive. I would read any other book by this author. This book also made me happy.
3,The Boy Who Saved Baseball,"Tom Ghalleger is in a difficult situation. The town of Dillontown is all about baseball. Its all about one game and the winner is the champ. The reason is because Tom talks a lot of smack.Tom really wants Dante Del Gato to coach their team. Dante Del Gato is a very good hitter, but he does not want to coach the team. Tom had the solution, he want to a guy names Cruz de la Cruz, who says he knows the secret to hitting.Tom really wants to become a millionaire. Tom would really like to be a manager of a major league baseball team. That is what my book is about. I liked this book because it is about sports and that is my favorite thing to do."
2,how the boy saved baseball,The boy who saved baseballThis book is about a kid named tom and he is at a game and he makes an awesome catch and the team likes him from then on. It is about modern day and the kid is about 13 or14 and he is the type of kid that is really shy and does not like to talk or any thing and wants to be all that he can. The only reason why I read was because it is about baseball. Baseball is an ok sport to play but not as good as others. I do though like this book because fighting for a place for a baseball field. The book in the end ended in a way because they had a deal if they the team did not win the last game the diamond would get bull dozed over and they would never play baseball again. But they did win the last game and the field did not gat bulldozed over and thy cheered a lot. Over all it wasn?t a bad book for little kid.
4,A Great Book,The Boy Who Saved Baseball is a very good book. [...]What I liked about this book was the story. This book had a good story to it. This book shows if you you don't give up you can win. Thats what I liked about this book.People that don't like this kind of story would not like this book. If certain people don't like baseball they will not like this book. Thats why this book is called The Boy Who Saved Baseball.My overall opinion is that this book is a great book. It has a good story. I would give this book four out of five stars. This was a great book.
2,"Gran libro, penoso escaneado","La obra es un clásico del que se ha dicho todo.Esta versión es un escaneo cutre que ni siquiera ha repasado una persona. Esta lleno de errores, más de uno por página, algunos aparecen de forma repetitiva. El libro se puede leer, pero no cómodamente."
2,Appalling lack of proof-reading - typos are rampant,"I have barely begun to read this Kindle version, and I'm looking for a different edition. There are so many typos, of the same sort (eg. 'cl' instead of 'el') that it makes for difficult reading. It's as if they did an OCR scan of the text version, and obviously did not do ANY proof-reading. It's hard to understand the text in some places, due to the typographical errors. I would NOT recommend this edition."
5,Genesis Version,"I recently bought this game from a bookstore (Same one I got the Genesis from if you are reading my reviews.). I had to clean it out because it had cobwebs in it (>_< Ewww....). I play it almost every day. This is one of the best games on the Sega Genesis, and if you don't have it, buy it...NOW! Oh, P.S., you need a six-button controller for this game tho work. you can buy them of amazon.-Sonic"
3,I love this game and hate it,the music is creepy but i love the bloody fighting it make a great movie but the only one life thing pisses me off the enimes look like they cam out of ur boody they make me sick but i dont really give a crap i cant get pass the first boss
5,A winner!,"Loved this book - a fascinating revelation of some of the inner workings of the Mafia although it is set in the charming area of Kennebunkport, Maine. It pulls you in and holds your interest almost immediately. The characters are well defined, and the locales well described so you can picture them in your mind's eye even if you have not visited there. The twist at the end wraps it up but leaves you wanting more. Thoroughly enjoyable reading but do not start at bedtime; you will be up all night!"
3,"OK bike, but falls apart over time","I owned the Mens' version of this bike. It served me well for two years, handling the Atlanta pavement for on-road commuting. However, after about 1000 miles of riding, the bike completely fell apart. The rear wheel became unbalanced (squeaking & rubbing against the rear brake), the rear brake did not work, the pedalling cog had busted bearings. Basically the whole thing became too unsafe to ride. The bike was unrepairable and had to be trashed.So if you want an entry-level bike, this is good for the money, but the bike has limited long-term durability."
3,dewdrops of scandalous morsels,Good thing the author had the foresight to add a genealogy chart The chart alleviating some of the frustration. The secrets cached among the family leaving dewdrops of scandalous morsels for the reader to consume with relish. ~Affaire de Coeur
5,informative and entertaining,"Typically, you don't expect a non-fiction book that you are reading to learn something of value to be enjoyable to read, but ""The Breakaway Brand"" manages to keep you engaged while imparting important facts and lessons. The brands mentioned in the book are a part of your every day life, and therefore of interest.If you own a business and are looking for a way to make your product stand out, or if you work in marketing and want tips on how to break out your clients, this is the book for you!"
4,an engaging and thoughtful read,"I've read a number of marketing and communications books in my career, and often my eyes glaze over by the third chapter. I didn't find that happening with this book. Its easy and engaging language and straightforward approach to uncovering a brand's truth was refreshing. We consumers know the great brands out there, because somehow they've established a personal connection with us - something we can't always name. This book helped explain the ""how"" and ""why"" of those connections.This would be a very useful text for college and grad students in marketing and communications - many of the brand references are relevant to them."
4,Good read!,This is a book which carries a good flow for light reading. Not a break-away book about brand mantras. But the examples are quite impressive and help in understanding how brands have been successful in the past.
4,Just what the director ordered!,This is what was requested by my daughter's voice teacher and director of a young adult abridged version. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is my daughter said it would be really nice if it came with a ring binding to open flat for practicing.
5,"Good score, introduction, translation","Our university Opera Theatre program will perform scenes from Le Nozze di Figaro in November using the Ruth and Thomas Martin vernacular. Although the text strays from the original meaning of Da Ponte's libretto, it is certainly a singable translation. This score is more than adequate for a performance and also suitable for opera listeners (maybe as a holiday gift hint hint)."
4,writing and illustrating children's books for publication,this book is very helpful. well written easy reading. I originally checked this book out at the library and decided to purchase it. Its a helpful tool for childrens' book writers.
1,Terrible Binding,My 10 year old son opened this bible two times and it split in two pieces! This bible is very affordable but not very durable. I guess you get what you pay for:(
4,easy read,This little book is a easy read for bible reading. But the writing is very small. If you can read small writing then you will enjoy this book!
1,"""Beautiful but bollix""-Philip Larlin","The British poet Philip Larkin accurately summed up the bible in 3 words. Certainly well written, it's a nice collection of primitive myths and vaguely-historical stories. Unfortunately many uneducated people believe it is literally true. Thankfully in western Europe god has been officially dead for well over 100 years now, but even today large sectons of the great uneducated Amerikkkan public are intellectually living in the dark ages. When will American society be mature enough to follow Europe into the 20 century (let alone the 21st)?"
2,Content with Contents,"I enjoy the subjects Mr. Bottoms writes about, including the social customs of the American south, the outdoors, family life, but most of the poems seem slack in their language. They don't have a real suggestive zing beyond the literal story. The author doesn't seem to weave words so much as to present a couple of strands together. I should mention that I think he has some good stories to tell, but he doesn't make the language sing, so it just doesn't seem like poetry."
4,Quality product for cheap,"I just started seriously building up my classical collection and I own several other Naxos discs and must say that this is the best of them. While some of my other Naxos cd's lack, in particular one I have that has Beethoven's 2nd and 5th Symphonies, as the renditions don't hold a candle to my Karajan Beethoven cycle from '63, this Bach disc is perfectly performed and the sound quality is top notch. While it may not be right up there with some of the older more expensive versions, for the money you can't go wrong with this disc. If you want a fresh take on Bach's violin concerto's at an affordable price, you need not look no further."
2,Not Sized Well,"Nothing wrong with these boots, but they are not the kind of thing to buy off the web. Go some place and try them on first. I ordered a 9.5M and they were about 3/4 inch longer than other shoes I have of the same size."
4,great game!,"I think I was half asleep when I ordered this game. It arrived as a DVD and I was expecting a board game, but this was a pleasant surprise. It is a great way to test your Bible knowledge. The one downside, which is the reason I didn't give five stars is that when I installed it on my computer, I thought it had allowed for one copy to be made, which I have not been able to do. I really wanted to share it with my Youth Group. One other thing, I'm not so sure on how fair the scoring is because for many questions you can get up to 250points, but no matter how fast I read the question, even when I know the answer before the choices popup I can never get a full 250pts....or maybe it's designed for lightning-quick fingers and younger eyes than mine.(I'm just over 50)It's a real waste with these type of programs that can only install once. I would love to learn how I can share this game.Otherwise, it really is a fun game.Thanks,Sandra"
3,not as absorbent,"We have been buying these for a couple of years, but I believe the last set of 10 packages I got were not as absorbent as in the past."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"I ordered 4 packages of 12 count OUT! King Sized Multi-Dog Training Pads and that is NOT what I received!!! I received an inferiour product that is not as big, thick, or absorbent as what I ordered. What I ordered is Leak Proof what I received leaks like my dog used a paper towel. What I received is 4 packages of 12 count OUT! Deluxe OVERSIZED Training Pads this is NOT WHAT I ORDERED!! If what I ordered wasn't available then I should have gotten an email or phone call asking if I wanted to receive a substition or cancel my order. Neither happened so now I have 4 packages of inferior product. THANKS....NOT!"
1,Piddle pads,"They work great; very absorbent. And cheaper than the ones I've bought in the past. I have a strictly indoor dog, and these take care of problems nicely."
5,Go the Distance Artfully Done,"This is a great companion book to ""The Art of Hercules the Chaos of Creation"" by Stephen Rebello and Jane Healy.The lyrics of ""Go the Distance"" bring the illustrations beautifully to life.It is in hardcover with a beautifully illustrated just jacket.Now, only if I could locate a copy!"
2,A quite incomplete reference :(,"The fact that the book doesn't live up to its claim to be a 'Complete' reference is not surprising given the depth of Linux/Unix. I did however, expect more than what I got. For instance, there is very little mention of Postgres. When talking about partitioning it mentions nothing that isn't covered in the little install book that comes with Linux, and when trying to look up how to do a search and replace with Reg expressions, it didn't mention how to reuse matched elements. In short, everytime I try to look something up in this book I find little 'reference' material and end up looking in a different book. Perhaps a better name for this book would have been, ""Red Hat Linux, a cursory sampling."""
2,A book not worth keeping,"Well, I know quite a bit Unix, but little about Linux specifically. This is my first book on Linux which I bought when I was installing Linux on my PC. It helps a little at the beginning for simple things which you can find on many web sites and the Linux manual (I was lazy to surf around so I bought a book). But, after just two days and my experience and demands about the system grow, this book became obsolete. I totally agree with the other reviewer: whenever I want to know something, I end up somewhere else but not in this book. Its instruction on kernel update is very incomplete, for example. For beginners, its instruction is of little use. No expanation about the specific contents of the kernel files and the strange kernel names. And it explains little about update procedure. I found the missing information very annoying throughout the whole book. It's a book of two-days' value, not worth keeping as a ""complete"" reference at all, even for simple things."
1,Really 1.5 stars,"I wouldn't say that this book is totally bad, I was able to install Linux on a PC fine the first time following the instructions. Although upon further snooping, just set your cd-rom drive to bootable and pop the cd in and it goes almost automatically. Past that, other than a couple of semi-useful appendices for commands, I found the book sorely lacking. For example, I could not find how to install programs in a .tar.gz format, which just happens to be the majority that programs come in. I do not like rpms and prefer to compile my own programs. When it came time to set up some ftp and apache, the book was almost laughable. It talked about the world wide web and that you can surf it with a program like Netscape, wow! If 400 pages of fluff like this were cut out and the price slashed 75% the book would get 3 stars from me, but do yourselves a favor and get something else."
4,It's an apron...,"Not much can be said about an apron. It does it's job, and it's cute. It's machine washable, although I haven't needed to wash it. I wear this more for the cute factor when in the kitchen."
1,piece of junk,The zipper on my daughter's safety blanket broke the first time I used it. This is a poorly made product. I would not recommend it.
5,IT'S GREAT TO HAVE SOME VINTAGE TR ON CD,I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED TOM'S MUSIC AND THESE TWO RECORDS ARE SOME OF HIS BEST. ANY NEW LISTENERS OUT THERE MUST HEAR THIS ONE. HE IS A GREAT AMERICAN TREASURE AND HIS MUSIC SHOULD LIVE FOREVER!!
2,A Necktie Party for the Ears,"Tex Ritter didn't play the synthesizer.This album features, quite frankly, the most unlistenable version of ""High Noon"" I've yet to encounter. The late Tex Ritter is singing away, make no mistake... but he's accompanied by a shrill, piercing synthetic Wall Of Sound - a wall comprised of aural needles! Halting the track serves to silence Mr. Ritter's vocals and guitar strummin'. But the shriek of the dubbed-in low-end Casio loiters for much longer.Please, please forsake this album, oh my darlin'."
2,repetitous,"Too much repetition. For each entry: If you have problems, your local plant dealer can give you advice. Well, often the advice you get is not accurate. Lots of references to what his granny grew. It's great he loved his granny, but that is folksy and not useful information. Ignores the problems with periwinkle and red tip photinia diseases.Pictures are very good. Book is well organized. Bibliography leaves out some important other books by competing radio call-in hosts.I get the impression that Mr. Groom is a nice, well-intentioned man, but this is not a definitive work on Texas decorative gardening."
2,product different,this was different for some reason it is very thick or not solid but more solid than it normally is... should have returned it.it did not come sealed. may try a different retailer next time.
4,Terribly boring but useful,"I had to get this book for my textiles class. The book is done in a rather boring format (it is pretty much just a reference book, what did I expect?!) but it was extremely useful for that class and for many more I have taken. Interesting tidbits throughout the book if you are at all interested in fashion and textiles."
3,Husband thought he'd like it,Husband bought this because he thought it was a certain game he had once. Turns out this wasn't the game and he hasn't really played this much. Not that it's a bad game...just he wasn't as interested when he realized it wasn't like the one he had previously.
1,Made in Romania!,"Do they even have hunting or know anything about it in Romania? They cleary don't know much about it which explains why your run out of breath after five seconds in the game and have to walk painfully slow 90% of the time. Also you can walk around while you shoot which my dad would kick my ass for doing. It turns out Cabela's Big Game Hunter, Cabela's Deer Hunt 2004, and Cabela's Dangerous Hunts for the Playstation 2, Xbox, and PC versions are all made in Romania. No wonder Sunstrom, the originator of the game went out of business here in Indiana. I was so pissed I returned this pile of garbage. Any self respecting American should do the same, or not buy any of these games in the first place. You think they could at least make a hunting game in the states. I'm going to wait for Deer Hunter on the Playstaion 2 which is made in the good ole U.S.A. plus the PC version is way better than Cabela's."
5,Works like a dream,"I ordered this brand of ceramic knife after getting almost ripped off by Yoshiblade. The Kyocera ceramic knife has worked very well at making my evening mixed green salad. It cuts through lettuce, celery, tomato and avocado with a breeze. I hand wash and dry it after each use and only have used it on a wooden cutting board."
4,North Dallas Forty,"Good movie, Let's people see what the game is really all about and how the players are under the thumb of the coaches and owners in a humorous format."
3,TOM LANDRY EAT YOUR HEART OUT!,"Filmed version of Tom Landry's tyranny at expense of Dallas foot-ballers, is fair adaption of first hand accounts. A ruthless czar, Bible-thumping Landry (very thinnly dis-quised in both the film and Novel), makes unreasonable demands from entire contingent - from players, to management, to physical therapists assigned to the team. Some very amusng shots at the beginning, in the locker room, at the party, and on the field, do indeed make it worth a peek. Not the greatest sports recounting, but you won't get dis-appointed. Somewhat aged cast is otherwise superb."
3,North Dallas Forty,"I had seen this movie a long time ago and it was not as I remembered. It is gross, obscene and stupiid. But it is what it is and I got what I ordered ok. I don't blame the seller."
5,North Dallas Forty DVD return,"My husband requested this DVD for Christmas because ours was lost, I found it shortly before I received the DVD and returned it without any problems."
3,Doro - self-titled (Polygram) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1990,'Doro' was Doro Pesch's second solo effort.Doro's solo work isn't as good as her former band she once fronted,Warlock(see my review of their 'True As Steel' CD)but she does give us fans her 'all' she has to give.Key tracks on this disc are ""Rock You"",her cover of the Electric Prune's ""I Had Too Much To Drink""(decently done),""Something Wicked"" and ""Broken"".Good 'girl metal' to be experienced here.I saw Doro play a club on this very tour and even met her after the gig.Believe me,she's JUST as hot as she is in her videos and on the CD covers.Bite me!Might appeal to fans of Runaways,Y&T,Girlschool and The Pandoras."
5,"Has a powerful version of ""The Thrill is Gone.""","Great recording. B.B. really takes off on ""The Thrill is Gone"" with powerful, percussive guitar playing."
2,Not as grooving as Live/Well,"The sound on this disc is nice and clear.This is all slower BB King.A lot of talking.The bass and drum section are mostly keeping time on this one, not driving the bus like they do on the live part of Live/Well.Great story with the liner notes."
4,oh 2 b a con in this nick @ this gig.,"great fun.takes you into the hall ,the booing of the sheriff and judge sets the tone for a fun gig.foot tapping and air guitar."
2,Remastered ??,"The content is, what there is of it, is entertaining.BB has always been more of an entertainer / singer /than guitarist to me and he does a lot of talking & relating to his captive audience.For this to be a good show - it should be twice as long and some of his better tunes shouldn't be in a medley.The remastering sounds to me like someone put the LP on a cheap turntable or the the LP hole was slightly off center because I have had to turn it off several times to make sure I'm not hearing thunder in the distance.I hear a rumble ( was it called wow on LPs ? ) every 20 seconds or less like the mics need wind screens.If I had bought this on a LP I'd be playing w/anti skating & worrying over it.Between this & the short set I can't recommend this unless you're a huge BB fan."
1,I dont know,It was a strange movie... Not really my taste... I'm kinda collecting Alice in wonderland movies but this movie has very little to do with Alice In Wonderland... Actually it has more to do with Madeline... The animation is from the 60's so its very crude... Its also a very short movie... and Its very random. Actually It didn't keep my interest for very long. And Im normally entertained by the most simple things... The lip sync is WAY off during the middle of the movie.. It actually confused me for a while...
2,Makita quality has slipped,"I bought this kit some time ago based upon previous good experience with AC powered Makita tools. I am sorry I did and should have bought Dewalt or Milwaukee. The saw is under powered. The Recip saw required repair and the drill is only okay. As far as I am concerned, the flashlight is the only really good tool, and the optional hand blower I also picked up, which I use almost daily. Buying this kit cured me of considering Makita in the future. I have a big horse ranch, use a lot of tools, and need a brand I can depend upon, which isn't Makita!"
4,Excellent Byrds overview,This book is the staple Byrds bio with lots of excellent releases analysis and evaluation and varying degtrees of dtail about the various memebrs but not great detail on any as is to be expected. The extra chapters on Gnee Clark & Michael Clarke are both very well written although very sad and perhaps speak of two talents who wanted to live the rock'n roller lifestyle to the end no matter the cost.Sounds as though a lot of the info came from Jim Dickson and he is very sympathetically treated but one has to say that it sounds as though Jim & Eddi tickner deserved great credit for the Byrds ever flying.I didn't agree with Rogans evaluation of some of the solo releases eg Chris Hillman Slippin away which I consider a mighty album but we totally agree that Gene Clarks No Other is probably a work of genius (thanks partly to producer Tommy Kaye I'm sure).
3,Educational and revolutionary.,Before I read this book I had never heard of chelation therapy. Ms. Collings explains the history and practical use of this relatively safe and non-invasive program of therapy to reverse arterial plaque.This would certainly be preferable for anyone having serious arterial blockage and (quite justifiably) afraid of going under the knife. It could help one make an extremely critical decision a lot easier.
4,Boris We Hardly Knew Ya,"What a wonderful caring,compassionate man,who cared deeply for his fellow actors.It didn't matter if they were stars or bit players he would defend them to the end.He cites his good fortune as ""standing at the right corner at the right time"". That might be a small part of it but he was a very talented actor.Not to forget his family and his marriages and the joy of his life his daughter Sarah[though their relationship became estranged because of divorcing her mom and his work load] and the monster who made Karloff a household name. It is a very enjoyable read you will like it written by a family friend and fellow actress."
5,The whole package,"Years ago, I looked over nearly 20 handbooks before settling on this one. This text has reached a 4th edition for a reason: Dodds solicits feedback from teacher-users and makes meaningful changes. I have used it in both freshman and upper-level comp courses, and advise students to hang onto the book after the course is over, for reference as professionals. Excellent sections on usage, logic, and different stylistic formats. It's gotten pricey, but is still worth the tag."
5,Good Stuff,"Wow...here the X-men pose on the thin boundry between excellent and awful. This documents the last few issues Claremont wrote before splitting after a 17-year span, and is, quite simply, sublime. Magneto struggles with power and nobility! The foxy Rouge returns! The competitive patter between Gambit, Wolvie and that cutie Jubellie! The sight of Wolvie riving his claws deep into Professer 'Chuck's' chest! Ah, what rapture...and the art! Jim Lee is incredible, as always. He and Liefeld pretty much started the horrendous trend of disportionate art, but Jim's at least is plausible.To see Claremont's progress, read the first 10 or so issues in Essential X-Men #1, then read this fine collection of five issues. Make Mine Marvel (at least till '91)"
4,Need this book and another!,You do need to have another book and THEN reference this one!! This book has very good explanations on how things work BUT it DOES NOT give you any FULL C coding examples except at the end -one long Blackjack game.
2,"Well Written, But Out Of Date...","This book is from 1993 and is not up-to-date. It has no coverage of Java whatsoever. The good news is that Greg Perry is an excellent author and has a more current book in the ""Sam's"" series, which is ""Sam's Teach Yourself Beginning Programming in 24 Hours,"" so I would suggest that book instead. It is just as entertaining and a lot more current."
4,Not for Macs!,Fine book in general; I have some pedagogical reservations about the level of detail. But be warned: you need to have MS-DOS with Qbasic to work with it.
1,An insult to my intelligence and social standards,"I read this book for a technical college course called ""Computer Programming Principles"". Perry insisted on writing it at about a 6th grade level. It was a big insult to my intelligence as being an aspiring computer programmer. What I found more insulting, was Perry's tribute to Rush Limbaugh in the front of the book. Rush Limbaugh is a huge biggot with nothing helpful to say. Why the author chooses to thank Mr. Limbaugh for his ""excellence in broadcasting"", has nothing to do with the book or the subject of computer programming. The book is now used as a paperweight and may be used as kindling to start a fire in my fireplace. This is about all it is good for."
5,This is one great beginner's book. Perry is a great teacher.,"I've just finished chapter 8 of the book which teaches you the foundation of Qbasic and how to run your first program. Perry is a master teacher. Most people I've spoken to about programming languages seem more interested in confusing the hell out of me; I've never been this excited to learn something in a long time. Perry simplifies everything, making it accessable and easy to learn. I just can't say enough--if you didn't know whether you wanted to become a programmer or you wanted nothing to do with it from the beginning, just read this book and it will excite you to become one or help you understand why you don't want to be one. Great job, Perry!"
5,great for newbie,"I found this book fantastic. This is the way to go if you are new to programming. Some people may find this book to simple, but not in my case. Mr Perry doesn't go overboard with technical jargon. He starts from the very beginning and gives a lot of simple examples. I would give this book 10 stars, but that wasn't an option. I would also suggest ""Beginning Programming for Dummies"" by Wallace Wang."
1,"Great For First 40,000 miles","I bought this K&N air filter last year and have sinced cleaned it once and used it approximately 40,000 miles. I took it out to clean it for the second time and much to my displeasure found that the filter element was separated from the rubber surround in a few places. This means that unfiltered air was getting into my engine for how long I have no idea. I did email K&N directly a couple of times and they never returned my emails. I would have been happy with getting at least 100,000 miles out of this but for this price it's a piece of junk. To all the K&N fans who will probably question what I'm telling, yes I did get the K&N cleaning kit and yes I did follow the instructions to the ""T"". I bet many more filters out there are failing but people just don't realize it. I will never buy another K&N product again."
1,Amazon failed me.,Twice in a row I received not the advertised 5/8th arbor size but a 3/8th for a large waste of time.
1,This Cost Me More,"I ordered this product for myself on a Sunday night and received on Thursday; however, although their were no instructions to installed the bridge,it wasn't hard to google instructions ""violin bridge"". The bridge wasn't the correct size, the proper cutouts did not fit the notches of the instrument. Yes, this is a bargain!! agreeablely so, the strings are undeniable CHEAP and broke on me the first night during tuning,the Rosin came in pieces and the screws on the tailpiece were jammed. So before I could enjoy, music I had to first achieve sound, I took my new ""beautiful"" violin to a local violin repair shop, I had the strings, bridge, rosin and the tailpiece replaced; the cost including tuning and labor $120. So this bargain ended costing me the price as if I bought it in the local music store."
4,Definitely Worth the Price for Me,"Having played multiple types of guitar for over 20 years, I am fairly well acquainted with string instruments and some of the ""quirks"" that they tend to have; and have few complaints about this instrument. I wanted a STARTER violin, in order to learn such basics as proper technique, finger-positioning, etc., but did not want to spend $100 or more on something that I wasn't even sure I would enjoy playing. This violin has been perfect for my needs, and will be a nice piece of decoration if/when I decide to upgrade to a better instrument. This is not an instrument one should expect to play in a symphony hall - but it is capable of producing a decent enough sound for a beginner (note: the instrument is capable, that does not mean that the beginner is capable). It arrived in perfect condition & was actually better quality (violin, case, and bow) than I expected for under $50... So far, only real problem I've had was as much my fault as anything, so no complaints here!"
5,a plesant surprise,"i jsut got my violin a few days ago, so i was really shocked at how sweet it sounded, i'm not sure if i just got a good one or not, but agter i tuned it up and got enough rossin on my bow and a little on the stings *hint for those that have never played before, it helps take alot of his out of the sound*i am by no means an expert, i've not played a violin in almost 15 years and felt that it was time to start playing again, and seeing as i'm off serving the US Army, a great one like some of the Berry violin's on here, was an unwise choice,it was securely pacacked and everything was individually wrapped, the only complaint i have isn't about the instrument itself but about the case.the book pocket on the front is not where near large enoug for a full sized book. let alone a shoulder rest."
5,So far...,"I just got the violin today, good condition, with the beige interior, and everything inside was hunky dory. The only thing that was missing was the cloth to lay over the violin when in storage, that's it. Other than that everything was fine, I need to work on the tuning but so far I love it!!"
1,none,"good price,good delivery but horrable stuff i mean no guidlines ,it took me forever to set up the bridge since the bridge wasnt installed and the strings keep getting loose i tried to get intouch with the company to get some guide lines but they never answer my email so the violin was a total weste of money .if you are thinking of buying one ,you might as well buy one with a higher price."
1,Very Upset!,I ordered two of these items for a Christmas present for my daughter and friend. When my daughter opened hers we saw that it was broken. It was not a shipping problem either. One of the strings were already separated from the violin because the spring was broke off. I will never buy another item like this from the store I purchased from on Amazon. It should have been inspected before shipped. My 10 year daughter spent Christmas watching her friend play with hers. A million thumbs down if I had that many!!!
1,Not a happy customer,"This was ordered as a Christmas gift and I was told it would be here no later than Christmas Eve...... as of today I STILL haven't received the item and it is January 4th. I sent several emails trying to find out what happened and just today finally received a reply back. Horrible horrible customer service. I am now being told it was sent on January 2nd, after being told it was sent in time for Christmas. I would give 0 stars if that was an option."
2,rawr,"I took my time and picked out a cheap violin to fool around with and this looked like a good deal. I even paid attention to when everyone said that you need to be careful with the strings and all that jazz BUT the stupid things snapped...twice and I even had the music store tune it after I broke the first string and he snapped 2 more while I was standing there. Im just annoyed with it, maybe it was just mine but...rawr."
2,Looks good sounds wrong,Apparently the violin teacher said the instrument sounds wrong. I don't know I don't play the violin but he told us to get another so now I'm back at square one.
3,It's ok,"I'm not trying to dis this violin. I believe that with time, the violin will warm up to my playing techniques and eventually, will sound really well. The only problem I had with the violin was the bridge. As I try to adjust the strings, tuning it to the pitch, the bridge snapped off. I thought nothing of it and thought that the bridge was slanted so the tightness of the strings made it come off. So I tried one more time. Just like the last time, it flew off. With closer inspection, I saw that the bridge snapped almost in half. I don't believe that the violin was poorly made. It was just the bridge. It does sound about screechy and has a sort of tin-y sound to it, but I believe that this violin is good for the price I recieved it."
1,don't order this violin,"After fighting with getting this violin in tune for two months, we took it to my son's violin teacher. Her professional opinion is that I need to return it. I will have to contact the seller because I am past the 30 days listed for returns. The pegs on the violin will not stay in position to tune it. We tried peg dope and even new strings to keep it in tune. The violin does look pretty, the case was nice and the bow was of good quality. However,with it being unable to be tuned, it is useless."
1,JUNK,"Well since you e-mailed me looking for a review here goes. JUNK, GARBAGE, but I guess you get what you pay for"
3,Black Violin,I bought this violin for my daughter and then I read some reviews and was worried I had made a bad choice but my daughter really likes it and said all her classmates like it too. The bow is crappy but I guess as long as my daughter is happy I'm happy.
1,Very poor quality,The strings on the violin will not stay tight. My daughter and I were very disappointed on Christmas morning. So sad.
2,Didn't really like,"The Violin was really poor quality. At this price I wasn’t expecting a lot, but the violin had several lumps in the wood and because it’s black it doesn’t look good at all. The case was okay, the strap is not as durable as I would like for my 13 year old. I would not recommend this product."
1,There are better introductory DSP books out there.,"I found the book to be lacking in background material, and consequently difficult to follow at times. At the same time the book didn't go far enough to give you a real sense of how to implement DSP.There are other introductory DSP books that are much better in my opinion:""A Digital Signal Processing Primer"" by Ken Steiglitz ISBN 0-8053-1684-1""Digital Signal Processing and the Microcontroller"" by Grover and Deller ISBN 0-13-081348-6"
3,"Authors, try again... could almost have been very good !",This book attempts to cover the DSP field from a non too mathematical approach - which is nice. You would however need an electronic engineering back ground to understand what is discussed in general. The book is good for a conceptual overview of DSP but sadly lacks depth to a great extent. I did however find it useful and would recommend it for beginners as supplementary reading material.
4,a good book but not the best SVH book,Liz is dating Jeffrey French till Todd her old boyfriend moves back from Vermont. Liz has to choose between them and she ends up choosing Todd just because he was her old boyfriend. I think Liz is soooo pathetic she always goes back to todd.
5,"Todd Wilkins or Jeffrey French,Elizabeth must choose","When Todd Wilkins moves back to Sweet Valley from Vermont,He has alot more money and a mansion.Elizabeth and him are still in love. The problem is Elizabeth and Jeffrey have been steady dating for a few monthes now. Todd goes to this Lovett Acdemy ,where this rich Spoiled brat Courtney Kane has designs on Todd,and she and her 2 best friends write notes to make Elizabeth think it was from Todd.It all comes out at Todd's party.Elizabeth and Jeffrey are no more at Todd's party and neither are Jessica and Sheiffield."
3,Pretty good,"Thsi book has a very good climax. At the begining, it is sort of boring because it is just a lot of stuff you really don't want to know about. Really, this book is about a young girl named Ellen who goes on a voyage for her father to deliver some bread to his read. Then, she gets on a boat with all soliders but it turnes out that she took the wrong boat! Then, she goes through great lengths to deliver the bread. I think you should read it, but be sure not to conclude that this book is bad just bacause it has a bad starting. Don't get me wrong, you might like the starting, but I'm just telling about my experience. Please read!"
2,not another teen review,As you can obviously see I was not all that impressed with this book. It is a fine historic novel to be sure. But only up to a certain age. You would not want to read this book if you were a teenager. But it is a very good book to teach younger children the type of secrecy the Americans had to go through to earn their independence. It also has a surprising ending but I'm not going to tell you what it is because that would ruin the surprise.
1,Terrible Toliver's Secret,"Toliver's Secret is about a girl named Toliver. She is bullied by a bigger girl. Toliver has to deliver a message hidden in A LOAF OF BREAD!. She looks like a boy with the hair cut she gets and I just flat out thought this book was dumb. A story element it had, I mean didnt have was suspense. This book is sodumb, it deserves 1 star."
4,Toliver's Secret,"This book is about a ten year old girl who has to send a secret message baked in bread to her grandfather's friend during the Revolutionary War. She has never seen him before, and he is in a town she has never been to before. She has to do it for her grandfather because he hurt his foot. It sounded easy at first. She has to dress up as a boy and sail with a fisherman across a bay and go to Mr. Shannon and give him the bread, then come home. But on the way she gets into many troubles.This book is good for it's kind but I don't really like historical novels. That is why I rated it four stars. Kids who like historical novels will like this book."
5,Really Exciting,"This book has excitement from the beginning to the end. It takes place during the Revolutionary war. Ellen, a 10 year old, must take an important message across New York Harbor to Elizabeth Town. The British are everywhere and are staying in everyone's houses. They are also taking over everything, so when Ellen mistakingly gets off at Amboy (10-13 miles away from Elizabeth Town), she must walk instead of taking the stage coach. Ellen meets a special friend on her journey who teaches her an important lesson. Despite the hardships Ellen has while she is on her mission, she is rewarded in the end. I highly recommend this book. I couldn't put it down."
4,A nice quick book about the Revolutionary War.,"This story begins with a young girl who overhears her grandfather talking to her mother about needing to get a secret message delivered. After her grandfather is hurt and cannot walk, it is decided that she should deliver the message about the British soldiers to a tavern owner in a nearby town instead. Toliver's hair is cut so that she will look like a boy and won't be questionned about why she is traveling alone. Many surprises overtake Toliver as she attempts to deliver her message which is hidden inside a loaf of bread. I enjoyed this book because it was a quick read which delved into some key facts surrounding some battles during this war. It was also from a female point of view. Most times, war books are written with a male protagonist. I enjoyed also how Toliver was able to overcome her fears as she strives to deliver the message. She is willing to risk her life so that others may live."
1,Starless Story,"Elderly, white-haired Monsignor Joseph Higgins is killed off on page 32, rather too late to generate any interest. Like most of the stock characters in this mystery, he's unbelievable, inconsistent, and surprisingly uninteresting. Supposedly he's embezzling church funds and ending an affair with a fiftyish ex-Sister. An old man brags (yes, brags) to Higgins that his divorced daughter is committing adultery, and then is furious that Higgins denies Communion to the woman. Since Higgins is so venal an unbeliever, it's unlikely he'd bother. But the father and daughter are as unbelieving if they think adultery equals a state of grace! The best character is the hated housekeeper, who is consistently described as extremely old after 40 years' service -- she's about 55, having come from Ireland in 1958 as a schoolgirl planning to continue her education. The heroine, Sister Mary Helen, is 78 but not regarded as old. Such odd prejudices provide the only interest."
4,Where do all the lost socks go?,"""Why Dogs Have Wet Noses? And Other Imponderables"" has been around for nearly twenty years but it hasn't lost its charm. David Feldman answers some questions I've been wondering about for years. Like ""Why do foreign pop and rock performers sing with an American accent?"" Or have you ever wondered why peaches are fuzzy? Then there is the question of the missing socks. My own take on socks is that they get caught inside other clothes and are rediscovered later, however I do have some socks that have never reappeared. Where did they go? This book gives some insight into question like this and most of them are fun and enjoyable to read. In this book you will also find out why woodpeckers don't get headaches and why colored soaps don't yield colored suds. For the most part this book is very enjoyable to read and is a fun break from more serious subjects.~The Rebecca Review"
4,Very interesting information!,"This books provides the reader with answers to questions he might have always wondered about, but didn't know where or who to ask (or even to ask to at all!). David Feldman has written several other books of ""Imponderables,"" which is actually a trademarked name for the types of questions posed in the book.My favorite questions included What is the purpose of the orange balls on power lines, Why are there no photographs in the Wallstreet Journal, Why do eyes sometimes turn out read in pictures, Why do so few houses in the south have basements, Why is a piece of tissue paper included in wedding invitations, What function does the necktie serve, Why does soap yield white suds. How do kangaroos clean their pouches, Why does the groom carry the bride over the threshold.This book is a great read. I would especially recommend keeping it in the bathroom, as it is an ideal book to read a page or two at a time."
4,Classic,Pasy Cline is to be very much respected for who she was when she was...I love this CD over the other compliations out there.
2,disappointed,I have listened to the original cd and found something missing in quality between that and the CD I purchased. The songs seem to be slower in pace and it just doesn't sound quite right. Disappointed.
5,Patsy Cline CD,"Even if you are not a Country Music fan, you will love this CD. Has all her greatest timeless hits."
3,"For Me, the Weakest Disc in the Set","Of all the discs in the Kurt Atterberg symphonic cycle conducted by Ari Rasilainen, I care for this one the least, and it's not the conductor's fault. The Symphony No. 9, which lasts about 40 minutes, is scored for orchestra, choir and vocal soloists, and I must admit that I found it rather flat and aimless, not sharing the sense of propulsion that drives so many of Atterberg's other compositions, such as the symphonic poem The River, which shares this release with the symphony. Frankly, I would suggest you not buy this disc separately but rather acquire the entire Atterberg symphonic set on the CPO label. Perhaps you'll enjoy the No. 9; if not, then the disappointment will be blunted by all the enjoyable symphonic moments you'll have with the other eight."
2,A Great Deliverance,"This book was selected by my book club, not by me. I enjoyed the author's descriptions and the plot was interesting but not compelling."
5,Dark and disturbing,"As the first book in the series, A Great Deliverance is a marvellous introduction to Thomas Lynley and Babara Havers. In Lynley, we catch a glimpse of the compassionate human being behind the insightful detective; a side of his character that is not so evident in later novels. We also get a window into Haver's background and the demons that plague her life. I think Havers has developed very well along the course of the series, much more than Lynley who often gets too mired in his obsessive self analysis.Instead of the trailing the conventional footprints, this novel probes the darker recesses of the human psyche. A hidden photograph, a cache of food and an enigmatic epitaph on an infant's grave are some of the elusive hints that point to the truth behind a gruesome murder. A truth that is perhaps even more gruesome than the deed. A deep and disturbing novel, A Great Deliverance goes far beyond just a murder mystery."
5,"oh, if I could write like this...","""A great deliverance"" is a textbook in introductory mystery novels. The characters are crisply outlined and developed; the plot is engaging (though not surprising). Ms. George establishes herself as a writer to be sought after and followed. Her Scotland Yard detectives Lynley and Havers are people we want to know, and to know in more detail."
4,A Very Compelling First Book in a Series,"This is the first book in the Lynley/Havers series, and it is quite a powerful one. Ms. George has very strong characters. She is also not afraid to tread in dark and secretive areas, as this book does. She does not tread softly either. Rather she enters in with ""gumboots""! This is one of the best psychological thrillers I've read in some time, and I intend to continue with the series. Lynley and Havers are a great team. Yes, you'll find that you lose patience with Havers as she blunders her way through some very dicey situations, but don't be fooled - she is extemely intelligent under that dumpy exterior. Lynley is a true English gentleman, and a very deep character in his own right. Unrequited love has a place in this book along with other kinds of ""love"" that are not nearly so wholesome."
3,Entertaining story,"This quirky mystery has so many twists and turns that the reader has to pay attention to keep up. The characters are entertaining and the plot moves quickly. I found myself getting interested, despite an initial reluctance to take this novel seriously.What gets disturbing is the back-and-forth playoff between the main mystery and the sad story of the conflicts in the lives of the two main characters. At some point, the reader could say: Enough, already! The wrapup ending makes up for the earlier confusion. This is a nice 'escape' type novel, but not serious literature, by any means. Some of the plot is very contrived."
3,A Grand Deliverance,"The story was good, but a bit too ""wordy"" for my reading tastes. Often goes off on side subjects, unnecesary for the tale being told."
3,"Not as good as anticipated, but an enjoyable read notwithstanding","George is a capable and entertaining author, and I enjoyed reading 'A Great Deliverance'. It was my first George read, and I wouldn't put her in the same category with Reginald Hill. But I'll be reading more of her."
4,One her best,"I read the last book first and now I read the first book. It is a page turner and the characters are well drawn and I particularly liked the main detectives and the sketches of jolly old england. The one thing I do not like about George's books is the endings and that probably will prevent me from reading them all. They most always involve incredibly sadistic sexual things done to children and that turns me off reading more of them. Since George is a former school teacher, one wonders about the meaning of her facination with abusing children in an extremely painful and sexual way."
4,A good place to start,"I am devouring Elizabeth George's series starring Detective Lynley and his cohort Barbara Havers. I started with some of George's more recent books and realized that you really should read them in the order they were written, so I bought ""A Great Deliverance"". It is not as good a read as subsequent books in her series but in my opinion it is a necessity to read and read first. It will help you develop the characters in your mind and thus help you understand them later.What if you have already read her more recent books? Should you skip it? Absolutely not, it is well written and entertaining and it will help you understand Lynley and Haver's relationship and how it developed in to the well oiled machine it is in later novels."
3,Better books later in the series,"This book is an excellent start to the series, but it pales in comparison to later Lynley/Havers books, such as Missing Joseph. Maybe part of it is that the major plot device, probably on the literary cutting edge in the late '80s, is a bit anticlimactic to my jaded turn-of-the-millennium mindset.Still, if you like the series, this is a worthwhile read that introduces the unlikely detective duo well."
4,Won 1988 Anthony & Agatha Awards for best first novel!,"Though this is not the first of her novels that I have read, it was the first she has published. I believe she's up to eight now, and this is my fourth. It's hard to believe that this is her first novel and, believe me, they just keep getting better. If you're looking for an author of the English mystery to follow, this would be the one!"
4,layered plots and surprising turns,"When I stumbled across this book in the library, I decided to take it home, because it actually started with a word I did not know! I do like English mystery fiction, but I do not like plots to be shallow, the language to be simple, the characters to be full of cliches, the whole thing foreseeable. Although placed in a classical English setting (including an Earl, peasants, a Vicar and the discreet noise of tea-cups) this is a modern book, with modern crimes, and a suitable amount of gore. Lots of psychology, lots of twists and turns, lots of nice , or nasty, or at least complicated protagonists. After this first contact with books by E. George, I have read them all. You probably want to learn as well more about the fate of Lynley, Havers, and the rest.And for those readers, whose native language is not english, don't worry, I bet E.George looks up a few remote words in the dictionary herself, to put them into the novel just for fun."
5,Great book!,"This is a reread for me because we will be discussing it in a bookclub. Elizabeth George's style keeps me coming back for more. The book is intriguing and has several story lines that set the stage for future books. The relationships she develops are ones that become ingrained your mind and the persons become well-known acquaintances. I highly recommend this enjoyable, intriguing, entertaining, highly literary, well-written book. I loved it the second time as much as the first!"
3,Good for what it tries to be,"Elizabeth George may not be the P. D. James replacement that I'm always looking for when I pick up a mystery set in England, but she delivers for readers. For anyone interested in the Inspector Lynley series, this is a must read. I picked it up because it was the first in the series and I thought it would guide whether I'd read more. The answer is maybe when I need some froth and find one of her books is handy. Nonetheless, I found irritating the way she throws in unfamiliar words that I'm loathe to bother to look up --- and don't need to in order to understand what's going on. I also found the romance-novel scenes a bit off-putting. But I'm sure those work for her devoted readers, of which there are clearly many. Finally, I give her high marks for focusing on character development and a character driven plot, even though the plot itself - perhaps for that reason - is slow to develop."
3,Confessional not a refuge for criminals,"For the most part I liked the book but it lost me with the description of the killers's confession. It's possible that a priest might give absolution to a child abuser. Cynics will say it happens often but if it has or does it is a gross abuse of the sacrament which would not be clear in this depiction. If someone confesses to a crime in the confessional, a responsible priest, which the vast majority are, would refuse absolution until the perpetrator turns himself in to the police. The priest would not be allowed under the seal of the confessional to report the criminal but he could and should and in the vast majority of cases would refuse absolution. I hope that people won't read this and come away with the impression that the Catholic Church routinely protects criminals. The abuses and crimes committed by the clergy are very rare even though of course any that are should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."
3,Did Not Deliver,"I *read* this book, unabridged on audio, because so many people rave about Elizabeth George. I honestly cannot see what all the fuss is about. This book's mystery was fairly transparent and I had figured out the basics of the case by about page 150. I am not a fan of mysteries but for some reason like them when I am listening to audiobooks in my car!I think that George's books border on romance (I have now read 3 others so as to give her a fair chance!) and also that she could benefit from an editor who is of the ""less is more"" school of writing. This book was just much too wordy. The length could easily have been halved.I thought that some of the characters were contived, almost caricatures, and poorly fleshed out.One good thing about this audio..the performer was superb."
4,Good Album,this is a nice collection of upbeat on the road songs! If you liked the movie you will like the CD
4,Good one,"It is relatively cheap ,easy to assemble ,less power consuming and works well. It is a little noisy but still ok . Comes with oscillation and 3 speeds. A remote would have been a nice to have feature cause it can really get cold sometimes and you dont want to get up from your bed to switch it off.."
2,Poor Construction,"It works, but it almost seems that this is coincidental. This is not an uncommon trait for fans, I have found, regardless of make and model. The plastic parts require trimming to get them to fit. The telescoping bushing is irreversibly jammed. At least it's pretty inexpensive. I would be willing to pay more for higher quality, but as I've said, these problems seem to be universal--of the three fans I have bought over the last several years, every single one has had material defects, and one developed an electrical problem which forced me to throw it away."
3,Jim,"The fan works well but it is LOUD. The box was labeled ""whisper quiet motor."" The motor may be quiet, but you would never be able to tell due to the very loud noise made by the fan blades. There are three speed settings, the lowest speed is still far too loud relative to other fans I have owned, and there have been quite a few. Many of the reviewers feel the fan is quiet so I guess it all depends on your previous experience."
5,NIce Fan and Easy to Asemble,"I was surprised at how much assembly there is to do but I had no trouble following the directions and I am happy with the fan. It does move a lot of air and is very quiet on the two lower settings, a little less quiet on the highest setting. I thought I was ordering a white fan but grey is okay. I ordered this for my husband's nursing home room and I like it well enough to buy another for myself."
1,Not to good,I know I didn't pay much for this fan however it was not worth what I did pay for it. I had to zip tie the front grate on as it was way to unsafe to trust it staying on with the (kinda) clips it has. It also has a lot of vibration which also makes it seem unsafe.
5,ok product,Quality product. Strong winds if that is what you are looking for you will not be disappointed.
2,Not White,"This Lasko #2526 fan is GREY, not White. The box and all pictures show a bright optic white fan, but it's a dull grey; not even a greyish-white...it's a definite dull grey. My other smaller Lasko fans are white, and so from the pictures, I assumed this was white also. I put them back in the boxes and returned them, without assembling or trying them out. Grey is not what I wanted."
4,A Cool Breeze,"I enjoy my fan. There is some assembling sorrows (the instructions are hard to follow) but, You can complete the project. I did... be patient ... It's a good buy and gives a wonderful ""cool breeze""."
2,Impossible to Snap on Front Grill,"When assembling this fan, everything kind of puts together, except for the front grill. It is alarming that the neck doesn't actually snap in with the pole, instead it just kind of rests on top. So if anyone picked it up, the whole thing would fall apart. Also the front grill is impossible to snap on because the grill itself is crooked and doesn't correspond with the snap holes. I'm going to see if the manufacturer can send me a new front grill because with this one I only managed to snap a few of the snap points, with the rest of them being unable to (because the provided hole does not correspond with the snap). Next time I'll buy a little more expensive of a fan that is better quality."
4,Almost Perfect,"The Lasko fan was delivered very quickly and was easy to assemble. It moves the air very well and is reasonably quiet at high speed. At the lower speeds, sound is virtually undetectable. The price is more than fair.As a previous poster pointed out, the pictures show the fan to be white, but it is, in fact, grey. This does not matter to us, as it is used in a large master bathroom suite where there is no air movement when the house is closed up for air conditioning, but it may make a difference to others and should be noted."
2,horrible journalistic talent,"This guy makes me want to puke. I've seen more talent in junior high newspapers. Garbage. Pure garbage.Obviously jealous of Ga's great tradition.What do you expect from a Tennessee grad?Try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" for a really good book all SEC fans can enjoy."
1,The worst book since Mein Kampf.,"Too bad there's not a zero stars rating, because this book irredeemably STINKS. This book is only good for orange rednecks, gator trash, or pesky Tech geeks. It's not even good enough to give as a gag gift. It ought to be printed on recycled paper because I wouldn't chop down the scraggliest, ugliest tree in the world to make a single page for this waste of space."
1,AT LEAST THE COVER'S RED AND BLACK,"If I were some inbred cretin, looking for a pathetic read to me the giggles on the way to my court appointed community service; this book would be perfect. However, I'm not. In a shameless attempt to ridicule the foundation of higher education in America, this book slanders the finest university in the land. Football fans--do yourself a favor and skip this one. I apologize that it even exists."
1,Paul's Epistle To The Nerds,"Finebum is seriously misdirecting his aggression here. While all the world (or at least some of Alabama) cherishes his lovable smirk, he's crying on the inside, and it's not over UGA (though the Dawgs beat both Bama teams on their campuses this year). No, it's over the nasty little bald man he sees smirking back at him every morning while he's brushing his toothies. Imagine how tough it'd be to begin every day of your life with a humbling experience like that.He comes closer to catharsis in his sequel ""I Hate Georgia Tech!"", as he must see more than a glimmer of himself amongst the nerds."
5,amazing album,"This is an amazing album.Even though there are only 8 songs, it is worth it!The bassist is awesome.This album is real Rock'n'Roll music."
4,"Brilliant orchestra and conductor, Disappointing audio","Stephen Gunzenhauser has done an impressive job performing Orff's scenic cantata with the Czech-Slovak Radio Symphony. The choir, as well as the fine soloists, sing with full emotion, and the orchestral sounds have lots and lots of power and precision (especially in Cour D'Amours and In Taberna).This could've been on the top of the list (along with Jochum, Dutoit, Welser-Most, Thielemann, and Muti) if only the sound quality was taken care of. Half of the time the choir is overshadowed by the orchestra, the soloists sound too distant, and the timpani sounds too loud when it's supposed to be very soft.Despite the obvious flaws, it's another ""Carmina Burana"" worthy of recognition. Buy it and never regret it."
1,Pirated Recording?,"According to CDDB, this is a pirated recording of Andre Previn conducting the London Symphony Orchestra with the St. Clement Danes Grammar School Boys' Choir, London Symphony Orchestra Chorus, Sheila Armstrong, Gerald English, and Thomas Allen. It was originally recorded in 1975 and released on CD in 1986. SeeOrff: Carmina Burana. It may just be a mistake of a label uploaded to CDDB or it may be pirated material.If it is pirated, this may account for the poor sound quality noted by other reviewers. It was originally an ADD recording done by EMI."
2,Uninspired,"This has to be the single most bland recording I have ever heard of this work. The tempi are fine, but the dynamic contrasts are non-existant. The baritone also can make or break this work, and Kusnjer did nothing for me on this recording. I much prefer Andre Previn's EMI recording with the London Philharmonic, as well as any other recording I've heard on the radio. I cannot discourage this recording enough."
4,Solid chips for a home game,"A lot of people are complaining about the cheapness of the case handle, and while it is flimsy, you can easily use your other hand to help support the weight. And if you're like me, the case isn't moving very far. I think its rather nit-picky to give the item a 2 star rating when your interaction with the case is minimal.The chips are great chips, especially for those who do not like denominational values on the chip. I have this set of 1000 and another set of 500 to host a decent sized home game. The rows in the case have room for 110 chips; I simply bought another 100 of 4 different colors to have high value chips and it keeps the others in the case from moving around.Again, if you're looking for solid chips that aren't overly flashy but feel great when playing with your friends, you can't beat this deal. If all you care about it the handle on the case and nothing else, well, I'd imagine you also get upset when a DVD case breaks but the DVD disc itself still works fine."
2,Great Chips - Bad Case Handle,Recently hosted a 45 person tournament so we ordered 2 of these sets. The chips do not come in the case (they are wrapped separately) and thats fine. The problem is the case handles. One broke before the chips were even in it. A close look and you can see the handle looks rather cheap.When the chips are loaded in the case (as they will be when ever you use the handles) it is way to heavy for this cheap plastic handle. It is a bummer because the chips are fine.
3,Good for chip count,"Good to have chips around, no card holder and the dealer button is small and doesnt stand out well from other chips. decent value"
1,Be Careful in What to Buy,"I have tried several Puppy Pads and OUT! is out in my book. It does not absorb and I am having to wash my indoor dog's paws almost every time she uses the bathroom. The urine spreads across instead of being absorbed in the spot she uses. She makes little urine paw tracks across the pad. The last two packs I have tried, the cotton is so thin that in spots there is no cotton. Nothing has compared to Blue Ribbon Puppy Pads thus far. I hope that WalMart and other stores will bring back Blue Ribbon."
2,QUALITY FOR PRICE,"I HAVE BEEN PURCHASING THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON FOR AWHILE NOW, BUT LATELY I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE QUALITY EACH TIME I PURCHASE THESE TRAINING PADS HAS BECOME THINNER AND HOLDS LESS DOGGIE WETNESS. I HAVE TO CHANGE IT MUCH MORE OFTEN, SO I WISH TO CHANGE A FEEDBACK I LEFT ONCE BEFORE ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS PRODUCT IS FOR THE PRICE. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T DO WHAT IT USED TO DO. AND NOW I WON'T PURCHASE IT AGAIN BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT NO LONGER WARRANTS SUCH A HIGH PRICE FOR ONLY 16 PADS.5/2/11 WHILE I DO LIKE THESE, THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SKIMPIER AS THE TIME HAS PASSED SINCE MY FIRST REVIEW. I FIND THE ""TOP PAW"" PADS SOLD AT PETSMART MUCH BETTER BOTH IN PRICE AND IN DURABILITY; THEY ARE MADE MUCH BETTER -- QUILTED AND STEADY WITH STICKIES ON ALL 4 CORNERS THAT YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF USING TO ANCHOR THE PAD DOWN. STICKINESS REMOVES INSTANTLY WHEN YOU REMOVE THE PAD."
3,Works ok,"Bought this for my pit bull and perhaps I should have bought the larger one because the pee still got on the floor. As for the scent that is supposed to lure the dog to go on the pads, it didn't work to well, I was hoping that it would help potty train my full grown dog. If my dog was limited to a small part of the apartment, then she would go on the pads, but when she had access to the whole apartment and I left the place for a few minutes, she still would go somewhere else on the rug.I do prefer the pads over newspaper."
5,Just BUY it!,"I waited almost two decades for them to release this CD! Take It Home was out of print for many years -- and available on vinyl, if at all. People just won't PART with it once they hear it. (I speak from experience.) This is the album that introduced ""Better Not Look Down"" and B.B.'s definitive recording of""Same Old Story (Same Old Song)"" -- but ""Take It Home"" is the hidden treasure. When I listen to that song, I go Home; I go to a place that exists only in my heart, a place I'll never see again. That's what the Blues are all about, isn't it? Blues transport us both into and out of our ""human condition."" Blues connect us to each other -- and to our deepest inner selves. True aficiandos scoff at this CD because it's more R&B -- but hey; it functions like the Blues. It WILL take you home."
2,"no, no, no","Please, if you are going to buy a BB King disc, pick Indianola Mississippi Seeds. By far, much better than this mixed bag."
4,Lively and Enthusiastic Accounts,"Jeno Jando is certainly a wonderful pianist who plays these two Mozart concertos with much enthusiasm and warmth. No.11 (K.413) dates from Mozart's ""early"" days in Vienna, but it is very likable. No.22 (K.482) dates from about 3 years later, late 1785. Some have described this work as the ""Queen"" of all his Piano Concertos. The woodwind writing is absolutely marvelous, particularly in the middle movement. Clarinets are used that add beautiful tonal color to this great concerto. The sound quality is very good, and the performance is polished. Only reason I gave this 4 stars is because, although very good, it is not quite up to par with Murray Perahia's versions with the English Chamber Orchestra. But still, at this price, this release would be difficult to match."
4,Very good series,"This is the fourth & final in the Haakon series. Deals with a Norwegian viking chieftain Haakon Olesson and this is part historical fiction,part fantasy & ranges from Ireland, Byzantium & North America but a good read & coverage of the Viking age. A fine piece of period writing. As they say ""you can't always judge a book by its cover"""
2,Lots of fun but not very durable.,"I purchased this plane as a Christmas gift for my son. The plane looks very good and the ability to practice the controls while the plane is locked onto the charging stand is great. It took a few times to get the plane airborne. Throwing the plane level really makes a difference. Once the plane was in the air it was a blast. My 7-year-old son was soon able to do loops and barrel rolls with ease, as long as there was little to no wind.The main drawback to this toy unfortunately is a major one. The foam material used is not nearly as durable as advertised. I specifically flew this toy on a golf course to ensure if it crashed it would not strike any trees or hard surfaces. After only 4-5 flights pieces of foam broke off the wing tips and the tail section was breaking in half!Lots of fun but not very durable."
3,Fun...but Disappointing,"With one critical exception, this is a nicely engineered toy. It's made of fairly dense styrofoam which will fail on repeated crashes, but so would anything else that's practical. It flies very well (for the price) once airborne and provided that you are not in too strong a breeze (e.g. <5kts.) It has considerable power for the size and price. The big problem and disappointment with this plane is that the propellers are held on by plastic nuts. This would seem to be a good thing for replacing damaged propellers. However, the nuts come loose resulting in either: (a) A lost properller and propeller nut; and/or (b) Stripped threading on the propeller hub. These problems can be addressed if you have extra propellers. However, after one crash our plane also lost the entire hub assembly, leaving only the propeller shaft. With that, you are out of commission for good. This happened to us on the fourth flight."
2,ho hum,"flew great first time, then would spiral and nose hit the ground, after 6 hits the fyuselage broke into two, was fun when it lasted for my 9 yr old but not worth the money if it breaks that fast"
4,Air Hogs really outdone them this time,"By the look on the box, you might say,""Awesome! What a plane!"" or ""Oh man, I just gotta get that!"" Let me assure you: You won't be dissapointed. One of the reviwer said that this plane was a gift to her 9 year old son. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone under 10 years old. For the little wee pilots, get them the Air Hogs Defender, $30, a reasonable price, a lot of fun for the young ones. The Skywinder is really for more experience people, yet not really ready to go on to the $150-$200 airplanes.The durability of this plane will last you many years, just don't try anything drastic until you are really familiar with the plane. The box says this plane can do stunts. Don't try them until you mastered the basic controls: bank(left and right)and pitch(up and down). Great birthday presents, and also great for the upcoming holiday season. This will provide the flyer with many hours of fun and enjoyment."
1,Awful Plane!!!!! Waste of money,"This plane only is controlled by the remote for a few seconds. Once you throw it into the air I completey lost control of it. I was in a field and from the field it flew like 80 feet up and 100 feet far and I tried to land it and turn it off but it woundn't respond it just kept on flying in circles. Then it crashed into a pole and it right I could see the the middle broke in a half and dove down I went to look for it but coudn't find it. It crashed and broke in 2 on my first flight. It's not even controlled by the remote it's controlled by wind. Your going to waste your money. Before I bought it I didn't listen to the reviews and I got a bad product. Trust me don't buy it, it's awful."
5,The classic recordings are back,"I am thrilled this double disc got released. The singing and musicianship on these recordings is phenomenal. The jokes may wear a tad thin but the songs, all R&B standards are done right and are really soulful. It may seem a bit dated to the 90s but if you like soul music and bluegrass GET IT NOW.."
4,Perhaps Bronson's best 80s flick,"A solid and very entertaining mid 80s Charles Bronson actioner.Rivalled only by ""The Evil That Men Do"" and ""10 to Midnight"" for the accolade of Bronson's best movie after his 70s heyday.I've watched this film several times and always enjoy it. Kathleen Wilhoite makes a sparkling and memorable debut and was seen recently in the first season of ""24"".Bronson fans are very unlikey to be disappointed in what is - like many later Bronson pics - pretty standard good action fare elevated by the great man's personal charisma. Therefore, this film is perhaps unlikley to ensnare any new converts."
3,Gift,Can not really rate this product because it was bought as a gift for my father who had it on his wish list
4,This Murphy's Law? (...),"Charles Bronson is Jack Murphy, a cop under going a bitter divorce who is framed for a series of murders. Since no one believes him, Jack busts loose to solve the crimes himself. Trouble is there is a foul mouthed girl young enough to be his granddaughter handcuffed to him. The two join forces and, as they unravel the clues, the hunters become the hunted. It's the energetic performances by the two female leads (Carrie Snodgress as the revenge seeking killer and Kathleen Wilhoite as the foul mouthed girl handcuffed to Murphy) that lift this routine thriller above the average."
3,"FORMULAIC , YET ENTERTAINING","This is a typical Bronson movie...he played a cop being framed by an ex-con he sent to jail. The wrinkle this time is that the con is a woman, wickedly played by Carrie Snodgrass. Snodgrass, a foul mouthed neurotic, began murdering everybody who is connected to Bronson, in order to frame him, and everybody who sent her to jail, including the judge (whom she drowned in a tub) and the prosecutor (plastic bag suffocation).Bronson himself is handcuffed to an equally foul mouthed female, but the two join forces.This is an okay film, mainly due to Carrie Snodgrass' performance. She is so hateful that you just can't wait to see her comeuppance."
3,Bronson stinks; Snodgrass shines,"Bronson is Bronson--tough, stupid, plugging along. Carrie Snodgrass as the psychopath bent on revenge kills (as nearly as I can tell) seven people in as many different ways as possible, and she loves every minute of it. When she forces the seedy PI to open his mouth (""Say ahhh""), and puts the gun down his throat, I shiver with excitement."
2,Where's Jim Dandy?,"Some tasty tidbits here. Still, the author's decision to exclude Black Oak Arkansas as not being ""southern"" enough is puzzling. Heck, they played a rousing version of ""Dixie"" at their concerts and deeded Arkansas land to fans in their albums. That alone should be enough..."
3,Does its job,"This handtool does its job, I was pleased with it at first, but found that once you take it apart to clean the inside and then put it back together, it loses some of its power. I am not sure if I just didn't reassemble it correctly or what. But it didn't have too much of an impact."
2,"No power, stops turning",My frieze carpet stops the brush from turning in about 3 seconds. It does turn on fabric but loses power quickly. I have used a Dyson in the past with greater results. Save your money and just use the vacuums attachments.
4,Hoove hand tool for my Hoover Wind Tunnel,"This tool just makes vacuuming my sofa and chairs so much easier! I have a cat, so I was hoping that this would help me vacuum up the hair she leaves behind, and it does. You won't be disappointed with this product."
1,Do not buy this...,"Sorry all but this broke the first time we used it, not going to bother Amazon for a replacement but I am very disappointed."
1,Hoover Windtunnel Hand tool,"I used this tool twice and already it has stopped spinning! I am disappointed, but returning it will be a pain. If I push it with my finger it spins for a short time (I mean short like 5 seconds) and it stops.I have 2 big dogs and I was hoping this tool would help me with the steps. It does nothing.To be honest I can't figure out why it doesn't work. It isn't clogged. There is no hair wrapped around anything."
5,Excellent device,My order was shipped in an acceptable amount of time. The hand tool works excellent on furniture and cleaning vehicle carpet as well.
4,works well!,It works well- fit perfectly on my Dyson and is a great help with stairs. My only negative is that the casing pops apart at times. but it is easy to fix and worth it for the lower price than the dyson model!
2,Not worthwhile device!,"I have to admit, I lost the original hand tool, which is really cheap, just an all plastic, no brush device. Hate to say it, that tool worked better than this one, which I spent considerably more money on. The Turbine Powered Hand Tool works off the suction of the vacuum cleaner, which is OK, but not very powerful. It's not a powerful movement, so you're actually much better off using the cheap unit that comes with the vacuum cleaner. I finally found that you can buy the original hand tool direct from Hoover at Hoover.com.Hope this helps!"
1,Don't bother,"The tool actually works very well, and is one of the reasons I bought the vacuum I have. However, I have now purchased TWO of them. One lasted a bit less than a year, the other less than six months. I use the attachment on average 30 minutes per week, so I don't think I'm killing them with over-use. Nothing seems to be wrong - no string or hair gumming up the works. The brush just stops spinning. Honestly, if all I can get out of a product like this is six to twelve months, it's not worth the money."
2,Band broke!,"My son loved his watch until yesterday. The band broke and is irreparable. I wish we'd read the other reviews before we bought this watch. It's only 2 years old, but will now have to be replaced."
2,Band broke; replacement too expensive,"I've had this watch a couple of years (mine is actually a W-96H), but will never get to test the 10-year battery guaranty, since the strap broke way too soon. Everything else was OK to excellent. Kept excellent time. Time and day were easy to read (only fair for the date). The light made it readable at night. Survived swimming unscathed. Usable stopwatch. Crystal has held up without much scratching. Plastic case was strong enough, but the finish was only fair: the silver/gray finish has become obviously worn.I'm disappointed that the band broke so soon. Even for the reasonable price of this model, I expected longer life. Amazon sells replacement band for $13; whole watch for $17! Take your pick. Whichever you buy, the lifetime will probably be short.I chose theCasio Men's A168W-1 Electro Luminescence Digital Bracelet Watch, with a metal band. Predecessors of this watch have given me years of good service."
1,EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In my opinion,this is not one of George Strait's better songs. I like some of his other songs,but this one is not as good as them."
5,A very nice piece,"This is not actually a toy; it's a hobby miniature aimed at adults or teens.While this piece is very complex to paint, it's not as hard as it looks at first. This is the kind of piece that works with the painter, and even a decently skilled painter can get excellent results. You can actually get a variety of distinctly different ""looks"" depending on the colors you use.Sophia's special abilities in the Anima: Tactics game are focused around granting bonuses to other characters, making her very definitively a support piece."
1,Not to Happy!!!!!!!!!!!,"R e v I e w y o u r r e c e n t p u r c h a s e s, well!!! It would not let my wake up my computer form sleep mode, had to force-quit computer. Grrrrrrrrrrr!, Sent an email to Belkin and received no reply from them,Had to take my computer back apart and take out the Hi-Speed USB 2.0 5-Port PCI Card (Purchased on 09/02/2008)"
1,does not fit into mac pro 2008,THIS pci card does not fit into mac pro 2008. the front part of the connectors is too long. Must be an older standard. neither the 4X nor the 16X slots work.
1,USB Card from Digi Accessories,"Despite the Amazon ad and picture, the ""Hi-Speed USB 2.0 5-Port PCI Cardby Belkin"" from Digi Accessories (at least the one I received) is not a Belkin product. It doesn't look like the card in the picture and it doesn't work with many of my USB devices."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY --- *JUNK*,"Well, after receiving the card and following the instructions to install in a Win XP Pro SP3 machine, windows would not recognize the driver that came on the CD, nor would Windows recognize the driver I downloaded from the Belkin site.Finally, I called technical support and got some woman in another country who I could hardly understand. After hearing my problem, she apologized, then hung up on me!I called technical support THREE (3) TIMES and, EVERY TIME, they hung up on me!Save your money, buy from another company, I will NEVER BUY BELKIN AGAIN, NEVER!"
2,Dog Placemat,"Do not buy this product. It arrived and I put it to use immediately. When I went to move the placemat a few days later it ""stuck"" to a section of my hardwood floor! Needless to say, a piece of it remained stuck to the floor. It's a cheap placemat and not worth the money."
4,Meh. It's a mat.,"It does what it's suppose to do (keeps kitty nomz off my floor, yay).The only gripe: as I was taking off an annoying tag, it ripped the mat a teeny bit. Opps.Other than that, I like the print and it's a good size to keep tucked away in the corner.Oh, and for the price..it's PERFECT. I have seen these mats go in petstores for $15-20 (not worth that!)."
5,Paw Print Placemat,I was expecting a light green color (from the photo) but it was actually a terra cotta color which is fine too.
1,Not recommended,"The product was pictured as being green, but the mats that arrived to my home were pumpkin orange colored (no joke). Also, chunks of foam were ripped from the back of each mat, likely due to the sticky product tags reference by another reviewer. Over-all a cheap product and not worth the time or money. Disappointed, I returned the items the date they arrived."
1,Not worth the money!,I bought this product thinking I would be able to get rid of my acne scars. Nope. All it did was break me out worse. A bar of soap for $1 works better than this. Trust me it isn't worth the money.
3,Not for me...,"This product seemed appealing, but it didn't work really well for me. I followed the directions as directed. By the fourth day, I was breaking out like crazy all over the area I put the serum on. Normally, I don't have pimple issues, so I know I got them from this product. After that fouth day I never used it again. It took about five days for my face to clear up. In the meantime, I coresponded with the representatives from Zenmed. At first, the e-mails were annoying in that they kept responding with this clueless response, after I explained myself several times.Overall, I did get my refund, which they issue you a check that comes in the mail. They have specific directions in which they want you to follow. Since, I followed them, I didn't have any problems getting a refund."
2,Warm but not dependable,"I bought the Warmkeyboard for a cubicle-mate who's often freezing. While it's a plug-and-play USB install, it fairly regularly just stops working, and requires rebooting. I've tried to convince him to let me return it, but he's too polite. Seriously.On the plus side, it does get nice and toasty, quickly. Which is meaningless if you can't type on it."
1,Would be nice if it worked,"The first keyboard we recieved had a broken control key, making it useless as a keyboard. The seller's customer service was responsive and did send out a replacement, but the replacement keyboard was ALSO broken -- this one's heating element did not work. When I asked if they could guarantee a third would actually work as advertised, the seller simply offered to take the returns and refund my money.There may be some that actually do work, but I'm disgusted with the quality of the product."
2,The heating element is this keyboard's only saving grace.,"I've been using this since the end of December, 2011.I haven't experienced the failure issues that other users have reported, but I find that the overall feel of this keyboard is the cheapest I've ever encountered, which is a shame, since it's also the only heated keyboard on the open market.Also, the power supply, while not a wall-wart, is so short from the ""brick"" part to the plug for the keyboard that it has to stay on the desk. This is not desirable. It would really be nice if the power brick could sit under the desk and plug into a single cable that carried both the USB signa to the PC and power for the heating element so that I could eliminate a cable from my already cluttered desk. The USB and power cables aren't even the same color - one is white, the other is black. There is a serious lack of attention to detail here."
1,Keyboard DOA,My computer recognized the keyboard and installed drivers and listed it as working properly. However nothing on the keyboard would work. Also the power indicator light came on for a few seconds when plugged in and then went out. I have windows 7 and I have tried to use it on 2 different computers and recieved the same results.
5,sterling silver softball charm,"Cute little charm that can be worn as a charm on a bracelet or as a nceklace. Sterling silver, so it will last and very economically priced."
2,Not all that forceful at all.,"After Warlocks Triumph & Agony the whole concept collapsed. This is basically a solo album despire it's billing as Doro + Warlock (at least on my edition).And there isn't much to interest anyone. Perhaps had Warlock gone out with a whimper and not the T&A; barnstormer which was five stars all the way, then the fall to this wouldn't of been so heavy. But ultimately this is a poor album of weak tracks attacked without ooommphh, without power, the self promoting lyrics about how ready to rock we all are wearing thin very quickly.Notable exceptions would be the awesome, gentle lure of Beyond the Trees and there is also some pleasure to be salvaged from hellraiser and the cover of Whiter Shade of Pale is at least an interesting choice.A serious blow to the esteem in which the metal community held Doro. This is a poor mish mash of soft rock quite possible stunted by a lack of confidence in the face of the enormity of being a solo artist."
5,"Great mask, great fit, but a tad itchy.","I love this mask! It was in excellent condition when I got it, it fits perfectly, and the quality is very good.The only real flaw I find with this mask is that it is quite itchy when you wear it.And it has an awful rubbery odor when you wear it, but then again, don't all masks like this have that?"
2,Not the same as the prescription.,"At first I was surprised and happy to find this available online so I tried a bottle. At first, it appears to be the same as what was prescribed to me by my dermatologist. The one thing I did notice was that it was not as thick as the prescription version...then I read the label. Ingredients appear to be the same, but the first ingredient is WATER. So beware if you purchase this, it is probably a watered-down version of what you would get from the prescription version. I suspect it may or may not work for you depending on your skin condition."
2,Very odd....,"Someone gave me a bottle of this lotion before, and it was like a miracle on my ultra-dry skin. It stung a little upon application but worked almost instantly to give me baby soft, glowing skin. It smelled bad, but I assumed it was due to the fact that the product was almost expired according to the date. I threw it away shortly thereafter.A year later, I bought this from Costco. It smells a lot better (hardly any smell), and expiration date is a long way off, but the lotion seems more watery, and doesn't seem to work at all! In fact, it seems no better than any other watery lotion without any alpha hydroxy. It also doesn't sting at all. Perplexed. Wondering if they changed the formula, or if this is some knock-off. May try buying from elsewhere just to compare, or else will ask my dermatologist. Disappointed."
5,"Noticeable difference, love the pump","I live in the southwest and had pretty dry skin so my doctor recommended I try this stuff. After about a week of use, once a day every day, I notice an obvious difference in my skin. Areas that were dry and peeling aren't anymore and my skin is noticeably softer. I ordered this size because I like lotions that have a pump, I find I used them more frequently and the bottle isn't as messy, and this one is no exception. I would certainly recommend this product!"
4,I have mixed feelings about this lotion. It's ...,"I have mixed feelings about this lotion. It's fragrance free, but it has a kind of chemical smell. It also left my skin feeling sticky for a few hours after I used it. My legs were really dry from the winter weather and this lotion softened my skin. It also didn't require more than one application each day and it didn't irritate my skin. The price is kind of high for me, but it worked well."
2,I use a lotion daily on my legs ...,I use a lotion daily on my legs and arms for dry skin. This product moistened my skin. However if I applied it after a hot bath there was a strong ammonia smell that stayed on my skin. Because of this I wouldn't recommend using it after bathing.
3,Using for KP,"I have KP (keratosis pilaris) on my arms and legs. So far after about two weeks I have seen very small improvement with the bumpiness (using about two times a day, occasionally just once a day). It is very moisturizing, but I was hoping to see more results with my KP. I will probably update again once the bottle is gone, but so far it's just a really nice lotion that really moisturizes and doesn't leave you feeling greasy. I would recommend it highly for dry skin because I have seen great improvement in my skin as far as dryness goes.I am writing this review based on the results of my KP. So that's why I am giving 3 stars. I would give 5 for hydration."
1,Didn't help.,"I used this on my arms and thighs where I have keratosis pilaris. I would apply it after showering at night and in the morning for around two months. I saw no change in my skin. I had a lot of faith in this lotion in the beginning before I started it because my dermatologist recommended it to me, but was let down by this liquidy lotion."
2,I've been using the AmLactin 12% Ammonium Lactate ...,"I've been using the AmLactin 12% Ammonium Lactate lotion for about seven days. I find that one of the lotion's good points is that it has little or no odor. On the negative side, however, it takes forever to be absorbed into my skin, and leaves an oily feeling like that of suntan oil. This lasted for at least 10 minutes until I rubbed and rubbed and rubbed to get it to absorb into my skin. I don't feel that the product helped my dry skin and even made it feel dryer, as opposed to other products I've been using for severe dry skin. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Stanky!!,"I can't quite put my finger on it, but this lotion stinks! It almost smells like a mix between something fermented, like sour milk, and plastic. It did leave my skin silky smooth, but only after I washed it off. The lotion itself is sticky and almost waxy. I didn't care for the consistency. I much much MUCH prefer glycolic acid lotions, they seem to be less sticky!"
2,Doesn't work for Keratosis Pilaris,"I have used this product for Keratosis Pilaris Rubra (KPR - the type of KP that involves reddish bumps) all over my arms. Unfortunately, it makes the inflammation worse. While it (perhaps) may be good for Keratosis Pilaris Alba (the type of KP that doesn't have redness on/around the bumps), it worsens my type of KP since it inflames the skin. Produced a rash on my arms that put me through itchy, painful, burning hell for a week. It hurt my skin so bad.On a positive note: Good moisturizer though. Just worthless treatment for KP.What a waste of much needed money and hope for a cure for this darned skin ailment! :o("
3,I have extremely dry skin and also have ...,"I have extremely dry skin and also have eczema. While this product did, in fact, help my skin by giving it more moisture, it also helped my eczema. I don't know if it will have the same effect on anyone else -- I'm certainly no doctor."
2,This product improved my dry skin. I noticed ...,"This product improved my dry skin. I noticed a reduction of dryness almost immediately. Outside of that quality, frankly, I didn't care much for it. The lotion left my skin feeling very waxy. Its fragrance reminded me of the odor of Elmer's glue. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless getting rid of dry skin was his sole concern."
3,Pretty darn good!,"I tried this lotion after reading about it in an article on msnbc. I have a form of ichthyosis (specifically, X-linked ichthyosis) and the girl in the article had another type. Nevertheless, I still wanted to try it. Now I have already found a MIRACLE lotion, but it is a little pricey ($30 a bottle) and you have to SPECIAL order it. When I got this lotion, I thought I had ordered the souped-up, 12% version, but I guess I didn't. I used it for a few days and it seemed to peel the top layer of my skin, which is exactly what I wanted. But recently I picked up a tube ofGold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy Lotion, Healing, Aloe, 6.875 oz , (Pack of 3)(from Walmart, no less!) for $5! Did as good a job if not better! But I still give the AmLactin purchase from Walmart an A!"
2,Not as Good as Expected,"I had such high hopes for this lotion. However, it was disappointing in its performance. Not only is it sticky/tacky, but it is also ineffective at treating my KP (keratosis pilaris). My legs look a little better, but not enough to justify the cost of this product. Back to the drawing board..."
4,new lotion,I have been using lotion for just one month so cannot tell yet if it is helping to regenerate skin or not. Lost a lot of weight over past 2 years and trying to get it back to normal shape. Skin does appear well moisturized with lotion. No irritation at all.
4,A good railroad story,"This film is about the rivalry between two railroads to build a route through the Rocky Mountains. Lots of action, some comedy, a little romance, wonderful scenery, and a spectacular crash between two locomotives make this an enjoyable film to watch."
5,It is a great book,"This is a great book. It really caught me with the scenes about paranormal activity and creatures appearing from nowhere, different realms, parapsychology, you name it. It is a great book and I urge you to get a copy if you can."
1,Were liberties taken with the story?,The early drafts of the script for Poltergeist were either a chaotic mess or James Kahn took some liberties with the main story. Either way the results are not nearly as effective as some of the rave reviews would lead you to believe.
5,"POLTERGEIST ""It Knows What Scares You"" Excellent Read!!","This is a chilling read!! James Khan has fashioned a tight frightening text based on this film's screenplay. I felt it was excellently well written and expanded upon. It can be very hard to find this book but if you can find it, read it!!! It's great!"
4,A very scary read. Much better than the movie.,"I'm a big fan of ""Poltergeist"" the movie but the book is even better. So scary. The book goes even deeper than the movie ever could. We actually know what ""the beast"" is thinking throughout the story. He actually does battle with the little psychic lady before the final confrontation and many more new scenes that the movie doesn't have. Very well written and hard to put down. I found myself looking over my shoulder a few times to make sure I was alone. Read ""Poltergeist"". You won't regret it. Trust me."
4,Intriguing read. Interested by the movie? Read the book.,"This imagery and ideas in the film always had a big impression on me as I first saw this when I was a kid. This is the ultimate ghost story. The novel goes into much further detail on characters and meaning to the events in the story. Big details are developed very satisfyingly. All the reviews here are true, if you enjoyed the movie and would be interested in learning more about the authors' intentions with the Freelings' terrible ordeal, read the book.Reading the novel so long after seeing the movie renewed and reawakened all the creepy feelings I got from the film.Goes fast too. I read it in a weekend."
4,"Hard to find, but worth it.","This book has some extra parts that were not in the movie, the movie is my favortie. I liked how Dr. Lesh followed Tangina to the Freelings. Also the part where Marty has his gory encounter is a lot more gory in the book."
5,"Boy, Worth a Reading!!","The setup of this book is addictive. It starts from point A and continues to the last point in addressing the annoyances all computers present, sooner or later. Preston Galla gives us a title that is even fun to experiment with.But, you're not experimenting, are you? Galla knows that and gives you some alternatives into fixing the things that are problems and aggravations."
3,A good basic primer but not what I was looking for.,"Found good information here but it was mixed in with a lot of other things that went off on a tangent. Did not want or need info on sewing a button on, or which fork is which at the dinner table. Would have much rather had more information on what a tattersall shirt looks like and does it work well with a herringbone or pinstripe? A good basic primer but not a lot of in depth information."
5,"A Classy, Upscale Guide","Most men won't ask for directions, let alone buy a book on them, but this one is a must read. Full of good quick tips, it really helps get down to the basics and then builds you up from there. A great primer for people who want good, basic advice."
3,HP 2100 Laser Printer,"The printer did not completely match the description. It did not have a USB port, therefore I had to buy a parallel to USB conversion cable in order to use the printer. Otherwise the printer works great."
1,Be careful! Unixmacdotcom is is dishonest.,"I bought the printer, but it is out of work.The IR indicator ligh is off when the printer is ready, which indicate the IR receiver is out of work. The printer can't connect with my laptop because no data line was included in the package.I tried to contact the seller, but no one gave me an answer.The seller is dishonest. They claimed the printer is very good, but the printer can not be use properly.The seller is irresponsible. I tried to contact them, but none of them replied."
4,Classic,"This is a Classic!!!!!!!!!!!! When it first came out in the late 80's it was only avilable on tape, but now that it was re-issued on cd I pre-ordered it. What more could you ask for Cash on the cuts and Marv on the rhymes. Cash is one of the best Dj's ever to grace the turntables. Ugly people be quite, Times up and The mighty hard rocker showcases Cash $ skillz. I once had a cash$ mixtape back in the day were he and Marv were doing ""If you find a ugly women"" live at a party here in philly and it was nice to hear it on there offical album."
5,This band should be headlining arenas,"Evil Pieces 6/6/6 marks the return of guitarist Billy Gray and anyone who has followed the history of Halloween will recognize Billy not only for his great guitar playing but his amazing songwriting talents. E P highlights are the catchy leadoff track ""Angel of Evil"" and then the driving Bass pounding Hell great job by George and Rob on this Anthem. Throw in an updated Don't Metal With Evil and you have the makings of a classic set.Billy and Donny Allen twin guitars, the fireworks are about to begin.This band should be headlining arenas and that they aren't is a damn shame. I for one consider myself lucky they aren't as I can see them much more frequently in the clubs around Detroit. This is a major league release for a band that truly deserves much wider recognition.9 out of 10 Pumpkins (It could have been a 10 but still no Kill Driver, and only 6 songs.)"
4,GREAT!,"This is a great collection of tracks from Twisted, if you didn't get them as singles now is the time!"
5,Spectacular!,"This disc, like the others in this series featuring pianist Jeno Jando, is a world-class recording at a bargain price. Mozart would complete twenty-seven concertos for piano and orchestra during his lifetime, many of them the greatest works for that idiom ever created. In my opinion, no. 25 was Mozart's most symphonic effort in the genre he revolutionized during the 1780s. In many of these brilliant concertos, he pitched the piano and orchestra against each other, but in this masterwork they work together as one instrument to produce something extraordinary, even for Mozart. Concerto No. 16 is also a pleasure to hear, the first movement especially. The thoughtful rondo for piano in A major at the end of this disc is a nice extra that Jando plays wonderfully. If you love Mozart, then you should definitely get your hands on this cd."
3,Okay for six years.. now needs replaced,"I have two Doughmakers pans. I bought them Fall 2005, I believe.They DO turn brown in spots like people on here have mentioned and now mine are turning WHITE and this chalky-like stuff is on them. It's freaking me out so I am going to throw them away. We haven't switched detergents or anything and our water softener is fine.. they must just be worn out from use? Whatever is going on, it's NOT good. It's almost like the white metal is flaking off as well.Just be forewarned. I guess I thought these would last longer than this since they were so expensive. I believe I paid $25 per pan. I did NOT get them on Amazon. I ordered them from a fund-raiser."
1,Not as promised,"I bought this pan to make various cakes and breads. It is NOT non-stick and never was. After you have baked in it a half dozen times, the finish turns very dark and the pan looks like something very cheap from a big box store. Definitely not value for money spent. I would return it if I knew where to send it."
5,Such a unique grilling book,"The Lobels' have introduced a very nice and unique cookbook with the release of this one. I own several other grilling cookbooks, and there are many good ones out there. This one is my absolute favorite because the recipes are a little more than your basic grilled steak or hamburger. Try the grilled filet mignon with gorgonzola-scallion compound butter and the sirloin steak with rosemary brushed potatoes and red peppers. Don't forget to try the barbeque sauce. It's fantastic. The book's contents include tips on grilling, burgers, beef and veal, lamb and pork, poultry, game and game birds, and sauces, salsas, maranades, rubs and other condiments. There are no fish recipes so if you are looking for that specifically, find another cookbook. If everything else sounds good to you, you will enjoy this inovative book by the Lobels'."
2,Now Let's Talk About Music,"Book arrived very well used in worse condition than I would have liked, but price was good and it still was readable. Had to take it back together as it started falling apart in my hands."
3,"Not much action, but an interesting book","This book is not exactly a page-turner, but it's very interesting. Lots of information about the war v. Nazi Germany's submarine fleet, the creation and implementation of the convoy system and how the U.S. Navy took some early lumps but eventually figured out how to win the Battle of the Atlantic. Not much description of actual combat, but there are a few chapters which have some action. I've read lots of books on World War II, and this one covers a few topics in more detail than I've previously seen (maybe I'm reading the wrong books): the establishment of air and naval bases throughout the Atlantic, the convoys to Russia and the involvement of other nations such as Brazil, Iceland and Portugal in the conflict."
3,NOT DEATH COMES TO US ALL!,"One day I was searching around the different e-mail sites tosee if there was any new Good Rats product out there on the market,when I saw a title of a CD that I'd thought that I didn't have, it was called Death Comes To Us All from the Good Rats and I thought probably like other people that this may be like a ""sequel"" CD like the Meatloaf Bat Out Of Hell I&II, Cheap Trick At Budokan I&II, Frampton Comes Alive I&II, KISS Alive I-IV, ... there even was a Good Rats CD called Tasty Seconds, so anyway I purchased it from your company only to realize that it's Birth Comes To Us All with extra tracks, I personally feel suckered that the Good Rats would even do this since I had purchased the original Birth Comes To Us All around christmastime and if you want to be a completest like I hd to be then be my guest and get this CD, but for only 2 extra songs is it really worth it?"
3,Not one of their best,"It's easy for fans to rate CD's too highly. Often I've purchased CD's based on listener reviews, only to be disappointed. Usually you get biased opinions. I like the Rats a lot. They were a great band, no doubt about it. However, this is not one of their better efforts. In fact, it was the last album released by the classic Rats line up. Their follow up to this release was Great American Music - a tremendous CD. If your a completist, get this one. If not, get Rats to Riches, Tasty, Rat City In Blue, Live at Last, or Great American Music. Those CD better represent what the Rats were capable of. These guys were great, check them out."
1,The worst band of the 70s,"The Good Rats, almost to this day, use their nickname of ""the greatest rock 'n' roll band ever from Long Island"" like they thought that was a compliment; it shows the sorry state of music in that particular NYC suburb. Utterly without taste but with dizzying chops and strident lead vocals, ""Birth Comes to Us All"" proves you can fool some of the people some of the time, as long as they are full of beer and somehow haven't figured out a way to move out of their mothers' basements. I mean, you'd swear this was Spinal Tap. Avoid the travesty known as The Good Rats at all costs; the fact that barely none of their albums remains in print is testament enough to their utter lack of quality."
5,RAT-ON!!!!,"Want more on The Good Rats? www.goodrats.comAll cd's available.I saw the original lineup open for Rick Derringer in 1979, at Susquehanna U. in Selinsgrove, PA--they blew him away. Saw them again at RatStock 1, in 1999. Peppi, son Geno on lead guitar, and son Stephan on drums. Peppi still has one of the greatest voices in rock and roll.Uncle Rat says ""Always blame it on the dead guy."""
3,Should have been contenders...,"Long Island's Good Rats almost made it big in the 70's - opening up for every arena rock giant from New York to Detroit. But there is no denying what they accomplished musically. This album has some classic cuts (""Cherry River,"" ""You're Still Doing It"") but the three albums really worth searching out are TASTY, FROM RATS TO RICHES and RATCITY IN BLUE."
2,2/3rds of a decent thriller,"The first half of this book is fast paced and enjoyable, the characters are believable and the villian is mysterious and terrifying. When the story is neatly and naturally resolved the author seems to have realised the book wasn't long enough, so he restarts the story in a different direction, has the main players behave completely out of character in order to add a romantic angle and add a few action packed, but completely unbelievable chapters in order to pad out the story. It was promising enough for me to check out another of his books, but I'm more than a little leery."
4,GREAT TILL THE DULL ENDING,"I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GOOD. BUT I HAVE TO AGREE WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHO SAID THE TIME WASTED ON THE CHARACTER IN THE GARAGE WAS KIND OF A WASTE OF READING AND WRITING TIME. BUT THE BOOK HAD ME INTERESTED FOR THE MOST PART . I FOUND MYSELF SKIPPING WHOLE PAGES OF THE BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS NOT INTERESTING OR PERTAINING TO THE MURDERS , STILL READING ON I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD . NEED I MENTION THAT WHEN YOUR LAYING IN BED AT NIGHT AND READ ABOUT TOASTED BUTTERED CORN MUFFINS , THE CRAVING BECOMES STRONGER THEN THE INTEREST TO READ ..YES I HAD TO GO OUT AND BUY CORN MUFFINS!!!. I WAS JUST DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ENDING . IT GOT A LITTLE CONFUSING AND THEY REALLY DIDNT GET INTO THE THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE THIRD GUY AND WHY HE WAS INVOLVED WITH HORN ,PRETENDING TO HELP OUT , IT JUST JUMPED INTO A WHOLE NEW SCENE. ALL IN ALL I THINK IT WAS GOOD, AND THEN OK"
1,greatbook,if u like a good mystery this one is for you althought you know who the killer is in the middle of the book the ending is a shocker
5,This Is The Perfect Book,"When I bought this book for my kid, I didn't quite know what to expect. I was very excited to find that this is a book that I can enjoy with my child. This wonderful book with a heart-warming story and beautiful pictures was able to do something I thought no book could: teach something important to a child and allow the child to have fun. This book is good for kids of all ages and for parents of all ages too."
1,Lies,"Contrary to both the Amazon tracklist, the Sunbeam Records web site and the LP tracklist itself, this issue DOES NOT have ""Magic Potion"" on it. Don't buy Sunbeam's lies!"
3,Finally located puppy pad with adhesive strips!,"My local pet store quit carrying puppy pads with adhesive strips. When I went to search the internet for some these were the only ones I could find. They have been adequate, but not super great. The adhesive is fine but they are pretty thin pads. Will hold maybe two pee puddles and then definitely need to be replaced. But, better than nothing for sure!"
1,Why are they scented??,"This is sad. They are a great fit but are unusable due to the chemical scent that was added. It is a very strong baby powder odor that will not let up even with repeated washings. And whatever it is that makes it smell also irritates skin... after many washings. So they are alas, unusable. They really should be sold as scented. That way we know what we are buying... that is only fair."
2,Jockey-What Happened to Your Once Great Product?,"For anyone that has been wearing women's Jockey underwear for more than 5 years has to have noticed the recent drop in quality. The cotton is thinner and the sizing has become skimpy. I recently purchased 2 packs of the Elance Cotton Brief Bikinis and I was shocked at how much the product has changed. What a disappointment. And for you ladies who think the product is so great..you should have had the opportunity to experience their underwear before they started cutting corners, the quality really was fabulous. Too bad Jockey felt like they had to compromise quality for the bottom line. I would have paid more to get the better product."
1,"Love, Love Jockey","I love Jockey underwear. I have been wearing them for 6 or 7 years now. The past year or so I have noticed a horrible smell. As if I was not clean if you get my drift. My self esteem has been low because of this I did not know where this smell was coming from. I thought I had a medical problem. I have tried everything to get the odor out of my clothes. I have recently come to the conclusion that it is my underwear. I have them on for about 5 or 10 minutes before I notice ""the smell"". By then, it is a pain to go and change them. I now put the smelly ones in a separate drawer from the others. My older ones do not smell as bad or not at all. I am so sorry this has happened because I just love this brand, but, will now have to look elsewhere for my undies. It is sad, because it sounds like Jockey is not ""listening"" to it's customers."
5,The harsh ratings are overrated,"I have bought this brand and style for years, just not over the internet until now. I was wary after reading the harsh reviews about the odor, but I decided to try my luck anyway. Firstly, the smell is not chemical or industrial. It smells kind of like the powder fresh scent for deodorant, and it vanished after the first washing. I do not like scents in delicate areas, and after washing you are left with a great, basic, cotton bikini."
3,love jockey,"I got a few packs of these panties about seven years ago. After seven years of use, I finally have to order more. I have yet to order this product right now, but I hope that the quality holds up to how they were in 2004!"
1,Strong chemical smell,"I have been wearing Jockey for years, but the quality has been going steadily downhill. The cotton is nowhere near as soft or durable as it used to be and the sizing is often hit and miss. Still I kept buying them because it's hard to find 100% cotton underwear.But now, this horrible smell is a deal breaker. I will have to find another brand. Besides the odor, it is just not healthy to wear a chemically saturated item of clothing. Your skin absorbs toxins from everything it comes in contact with and at the very least it could cause an allergic skin reaction. Steer clear of these until Jockey addresses this problem."
2,Quality not what it used to be,"I've been wearing Jockey for Her for years, and the quality is definitely not what it used to be. The fabric is now much thinner (actually see-though)--and the size 5s are smaller in width than my older size 5s (which I still wear). The cut is now more of a brief than a bikini."
5,"soft, comfortable, well made",Jockey makes the best quality women's underwear. The fabric is soft. The elastic is non-binding and well covered. And the lining in the crotch is stitched all around. (Has anyone else noticed that other women's underwear manufacturers have stopped stitching the front of the lining?)
2,beader review,This is a book of black and white graphics only. No pictures of how some of the designs were used. Mostly north west designs. No graphs. Your on your own with this one.
3,easy to use,"I find this camera very easy to use. It takes really nice pictures and is small enough to fit in my purse. Only problem is it is not made well. The battery door no longer cleses on it's own, I have to tape it and the zoom button has fallen off for the 2nd time, 1st time I found it and put it back on, this time I wasn't as lucky. I think a camera should hold up better than this after only one year of use."
1,Camera breaks a lot,I bought this camera in December of 2003 by October of 2004 it wouldn't work any more. The display gave an error code #e45. I sent it back and they replaced the camara. A year later the new one wouldn't work and gave the same error code. It was no longer under warranty and they want to charge $110.00 to fix it. What a piece of junk!
3,beware of repaired items,"Good camera for 3MP, sweet pictures, battery life good, only one problem I had, the dial is faulty and sometimes the camera powers up by itself. refurbished products should be avoided, savings not worth the hassle."
2,"Great at first, Horrible Afterwards","I've had this Camera for going on 4 years now. I must say, for the years that I've owned it, there is absolutely no excuse for the lack of battery life. In the beginning everything was working fine. This camera has sustained about a good month of use throughout the years. It is greatly disappointing to learn that my camera is suffering a slow demise, despite the limited use. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! There have been far too many sporting events that have been ruined just because I couldn't record a homerun at a baseball game, or capture a slam dunk at a basketball game. It pains me to give this camera a poor review, because it was reliable at first. But it has severed rules of engagement with its user. Do not buy this item, nor receive it as a gift!"
3,Not compatible with Windows XP,"The camera was great and very easy to use, however it is not compatible with Windows XP. We called Kodak and they were unable to help us. Hopefully they will come out with a patch to help this out but in the meantime, mine was returned.As I said before, apparently they have come out with a patch for Windows XP but at the time I had mine, Kodak told us it was not compatible with XP."
3,"Nice camera, but not well made","I bought two of these after checking out lots of reviews and have been very happy with them until recently when the battery doors on broke on both of them (after only 3 months!) The only way to keep it closed is with a rubber band around the whole camera. Nice pictures, but VERY disapointed in the quality."
2,"Short life span, good while it lasted.","I bought my Kodak Easyshare CX7330 in February of 2005. It did well although the older it got, the more it ate batteries. With the money I have spent on batteries I would have been better off getting one with a charger and a pack. I have also tried every type of AA battery out there and it is the camera itself with the issues. Now, 2 and a half years later it has taken it's last pictures. The trouble began with when I would turn it on the indicator light would pop up green, then immediately flash red and the lens would not extend out. Sometimes it would work, sometimes not. Now I can put fresh batteries in and if I hold it just right I can take a few pictures, then the low battery icon comes on the screen and it goes dead, even without retracting the lens. As I said, it was a great little camera while it lasted, but I think I will get something more hardy next time."
3,Decent buy for the money,"I have had this camera for a year and a half now and I have to say, it is a good little camera. It takes great, clear pictures, and has held up to lots of wear and tear. My only problem with it, and it's the reason I am buying a different brand next time, is the battery life!!! It sux!!! As in, sucks the life out of batteries in no time flat! I have learned to not use the LCD screen if neccessary, to save batteries, but even then, they don't last long. Overall it's a good camera, but if you are looking for long lasting battery life, this is not the camera for you. If you don't mind charging your lithium batteries all the time, or going through AA batteries like candy, then this is the camera to get."
4,Happy Grandmother,"I bought one of these cameras for my son when his daughter was born. Since they enjoyed this camera and the pictures came out great, I decided it was time for grammy to get one as well. A great deal for the price."
3,"""Grace"" gets the Lord's Prayer wrong...","I've owned this book for years, and happened upon the Lord's Prayer this morning. Curiously, Cotner misquotes the prayer that she calls ""the model of all prayers for all time"": ""Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name."" The original ""Hallowed be thy name"" conveys the idea that the Lord's very name is sacred. Perhaps Cotner was thinking of Iron Maiden, a 70's metal band that wrote a song called, ""Hallowed by thy name."""
4,"Good Quality, Poor Quantity","This cartridge is supposed to print about 220 pages. For an average home office, that means maybe one cartridge per month. I would really like to see anXL version of this cartridge. This would make using the printers associated with this cartridge so much more cost effective. I hope HP is listening.In the mean time, I am pleased to see that the price has been reduced."
2,Disappointing!,"I got a new printer which uses this and 93, and no matter how I customize the printing to optimize/minimize ink use, the ink still disappears. After a month of little printing ink is gone. I had to check to see if it was dripping out of the cartridge! With old Hp printer I could have printed for 4-6 months on one 27/28 cartridge. What was the point of the upgrade then?"
2,How much ink do they put in these things?,"I run out of cartridges much faster with my HP using this cartridge than I used to with my old Epson. I feel like I'm being gouged (ripped off), having to buy cardridges so often."
1,RIDICULOUS!,"This little cartidge runs out of ink before you can say boo and costs an arm and a leg. To top it off, the quality of the ink is terrible -- it smudges if the humidity is high, let alone if you drop any water on it."
3,Try the 98...,A little investigating shows the HP 92 holds only 5 ml and is interchangable in many application with the HP 98 that holds 11 ml.
1,INK GUZZLER,"hen you first install the cartridge, the printer automatically consumes unnecessary ink by printing a test page with massive wide lines of ink. HP Printers consume more ink in less time than any other printer on the market! I would recommend dropping this INK GUZZLER in the circular file and purchasing the I860 Canon Printer (Consumer Report Best Buy) for more economical printing and better results overall."
3,Best solution is not to print at all.,Ink for ink jet printers is criminally expensive. I've started to print to PDF and run hourly back ups. Now I just need to implement an off site back up strategy for redundancy. The best way to combat overpriced ink jet cartridges is to stop printing.
1,Yuck.,This ink did not last. I bought less than two months ago. We didn't print out ANY photographs. We're already having to order another one.We had the same problem with the last cartridge.I'm guessing an HP red wrote the positive review on here. ha ha
4,Very Good Resource,"I bought this book because my wife has suffered from chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia for over seven years. There are really some great, new ideas in this effort. After we read it, we took it to her doctor at her next appointment. He felt there were some very good things brought out and has changed some of her medicine to the author's recommendations. We constantly read, looking for some relief, and have found this book among the most promising."
3,tilting,an interesting book. Memoirs by their very nature lack perspective and balance and this one is no different. It has a certain effervesence to it and you admire her perseverence through all her challenges - many self inflicted. It sure isn't a advertisement for the benefits of therapy though.
2,Its okay,"The game is okay. You can't rotate all exhibits/shows/food courts/resturants. Also the screen is locked in one position. Its not as fun as I thought it would be. I enjoy collecting tycoon games of all types and this wasn't one of the best. I got from my teacher who said she got it off of amazon for me because she thought I would like it. Indeed, I was excited about this new game. But when I played it, I thought I could make a park just as good on Zoo Tycoon Marine Mania. If you are looking for a good game with sea creatures then I suggest Zoo Tycoon Marine Mania."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I collect zoo and animal related sim. games and this is the worst! The lack of freedom is the biggest problem. You can't rotate the map (you have to spend forever trying different things to find this out, as the game comes with very minimal directions), you can't rotate some of the attractions, there are only 3 freeplay maps, all the attractions are pre constructed ( you don't need creativity for this one) and you don't have very many things to choose from. All around, it was a big disappointment. I would give it a zero if I could! The Zoo Tycoon games are way better!"
2,Not like the other tycoons I've played.,"I just bought this game and I don't even know how to play it, it's nothing like zoo tycoon. You can't even turn the itens around so they all face the front. you can't make a good layout that way. also you have to wait for the research to finish before you even get one animal and I don't think you can build a pen to keep them in anyways. You really can't build anything it's already made up and you just place them down. The concept is great but why didn't they make it similar to zoo tycoon but with the sea world atmosphere."
1,Horrid.,"This movie is horrible. I'm just happy I saw it on my Roku, rather than actually paying for it. There seems to be a story line ... but you can't tell for sure, because the scenes are choppy and the audio is unintelligible. Two actors seem to have remastered their audio, so you can at least HEAR their lines, but of course the dubbing doesn't match at all, so it just increases the cheesiness. Bad graphics, horrible audio, don't waste your time or money."
3,Disappointed in the sound,"It goes without saying that this music is among the works at the pinnacle of chamber music, and I certainly can't gripe about the price and value of this set. But when I listen to this recording, I find myself distracted by the sound quality to the point that I'm not able to fully enjoy the music. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad-sounding recording, and the performance seems quite good. But the sound, to my ears anyway, has a certain muddiness and indistinctness that I might expect from an old vintage recording but not from a modern DDD recording. I find it difficult to distinguish between the different voices of the quartet, and the first violin's melody is often not as clear and pure (for lack of better adjectives) as I would like it to be. Maybe I expected too much from a cheap recording, but I'm wishing I'd spent more money on a more highly-recommended recording of these great works (likeAlban Berg Quartet Mozart: String Quartets Nos. 14 - 23)."
4,Give it a chance,I love these kinds of movies. When I read the first review and saw that it only had 3 stars I was a bit worried I would not like it.I was surprised.Sure it maybe seem a bit cliche but such is life.I found it was pretty good though I would have liked to see a bit more dancing vs the story line. That does not mean the story line was horrible. It was very realistic.Just give it a chance. Tune out the world and let the movie/music move you.I wanted to reach in the movie and hug the two women Carmen and Gina. Life is not easy for a lot of folks and there are some out there that give up before they've had a chance to show their dance. So allow yourself to go with the flow of this movie and smile at the end. I did!
1,There was NOTHING I liked about this movie,"25 minutes into this I decided I had enough. The story sucks, the girl isn't a very good dancer (perhaps she gets better, but I wasn't interested enough to find out as I don't think it would make the movie better) - the lead just seems like a stupid girl who even has a stupid look on her face when she dances - and her best friend is an annoying slutty fat girl who thinks she has an awesome figure and does not help the movie along at all (why is she even in the story?)There was really NOTHING I liked about this movie."
2,Just say no!,The acting and dancing were absolutely horrendous. The plot didn't make an ounce of sense. I watched the whole movie because I kept hoping that the end would be worth it--it wasn't. This movie was awful.
1,Very Displeased,"We had our pool installed in October, 2005. We are currently on our third cell and mother board. Replacing cells and mother boards get very expensive to say the least. The warrantly period for the initial products was 3 years. However, when you replace the cell or mother board you only get a one year warranty. The only positive we have found thus far is that the pool water does not irritate the eyes compared to chlorine. I would not recommend it. Yes, our system is grounded and we still have had mother board issues. Another negative - the salt water kills grass if you ever have a problem with the pool water and need to eliminate it as we did when the mother board went out again. Our pool has become a money pit."
1,Not satisfied.,"Not satisfied. The foil wrapping was off on more than half the bag, and when you touched them more of the foil wrapping came off."
3,Clutch -Not as advertised.,I ordered a Beck / Arnley clutch and received a Beck / Arnley box with an Excedy clutch inside. I called the vendor and they said they sometimes substitute Excedy clutches for Beck / Arnley. I was very disappointed getting an Excedy clutch instead of what I ordered. The clutch works fine but I could have purchased an Excedy for much less from another vendor. The Beck / Arnley clutches are very good and cost considerable more than the cheaper Excedy clutches but I needed one right away to get my car back on the road and didn't want to wait to ship this one back and find another clutch.
2,"Not only not the best, not even close.","I disagree with 'Bob' (below). First, the 20th Piano Contero is not Mozart's best; surely either 23d or 24th is. Second, I believe that in the first movement of the 20th, the soloist has to have the mentality of a tank-gunner. *He* is the man calling the shots, literally shooting through the orchestra. Although Jando has a good amount of energy, he doesn't sound as if in command, but as if he likes the idea of being in command. Another problem is that his piano is tuned to a rich Romantic tone which is not conducive to Mozart, and which contributes his lack of command. He's supposed to be a gunner, why doesn't he have the right gun? His Romantic piano hurts this and other recordings of pre-Romantic music e.g. his Bach."
4,As good an un-biased book as you will find.,"This author has attempted an un-biased, historically accurate tale of Richard III. He uses all available references to present the story of an often misunderstood King. While he is not always successful in being unbiased, this book is worth the read"
5,Simply the best,"This brilliant biography was first published in 1955, but it stands the test of time. It is pro Richard which some people may count as a negative, but I don't. It is balanced and impeccably researched with extensive notes and use of primary sources. Where he conjectures he tells us so and gives coherent arguments for his conclusions. I wish other biographies I have read met the same standard. This is an outstanding portrait of a man and his times.It is well written and flows beautifully. I loved it!!"
4,good mattress pad,"I got this to cushion my mattress which is a bit too firm. While the padding does squish down a bit it retains softness and doesn't migrate. As mattress pads go, this is a really good one. It's well constructed and the elastic doesn't slip off the corners. It doesn't seem to retain heat. Very comfy."
4,Very comfortable,This product seems to be exactly what it describes. I am very happy with my purchase. I have some lower back pain and the last few nights my back has not hurt in the morning! What a relief. It seems to fit nicely over my queen mattress and has not slipped off. The only thing about this pad is that it does get pretty warm. A plus in the winter though! I am very happy and would purchase other products from this company in the future.
4,Mattress Topper,This is such a great luxury for your body. It is absolutely wonderful if you want to feel good after you wake up.
1,Filler bunches to the feet,My wife and I bought this for Christmas and in two days the filler had settled to the foot of the pad. There is nothing to keep the filler in place top to bottom although it does from side to side. Would not recommend this item.
5,A great blast from the past!,"Saw these guys in the late 70's as the warmup act for Rick Derringer at a small university in Pennsylvania. They rocked the house like almost no band I'd ever seen. I'd have to say they were probably the best live band I ever heard, and I've heard many. Musicianship second to none, great vocals, tight arrangements, diverse music and lyrics----they had it all! This album was supposed to be their breakout album; however, it never happened. Great wah wah pedal work on the rocker, ""Victory in Space"" is one of several highlights of this album/CD. If you want to hear what rock really was about in the 70'S, buy it!"
1,Do NOT Buy from these Folks,"Do not purchase from these folks. I spent $18 on what was supposed to be a new release of this disk. It did not play, and upon investigation there is a large groove scratched on the disk playing surface."
4,Great Album........,"I Think there best album ............winner I had this on album, Cassette, 8 Track on cd that was burned of a album....glad to have the real thing again with the cracks & PopsRats rule"
5,Don't Leave Home Without It!!,"This is a terrific book. The author gives some great ideas on things to do before you leave, when you are gone and when you get home again. The ideas are simple and fun for the kids. If you can't be at home as often as you'd like, then The Business Traveling Parent really offers some simple solutions to staying close to your kids. This is also a great gift for any busy executive, salesperson, or anyone who travels more than they would like to."
4,Excellent Coffee - Expensive Shipping,"Coffee is great. It is hard to find a good variety of flavored decaf. The coffee is delicious. However, the shipping costs are high. Add at least 1/3 more to the total cost for shipping. I would order again because the coffee is delicious, but only on special occasions because the shipping makes this coffee pretty expensive."
3,A little tricky to install,"I'm not the most adept person to do anything 'home improvement'-related but I'd had an easier time with other TV mounts. However, once you struggle through the pain of getting the thing to stick to the wall, it's small footprint is a major benefit, although - psychologically - it's hard to believe it can support the weight. No problems so far though!"
4,Provides some good ideas about personal goal setting,Tony Robbins provides some good insights into personal goal setting. This text refers to the six/eight audio cassettes edition of this title spoken by Tony Robbins himself.
3,Good primer but lacks substance,"Anything by AR is good, hearing his voice and his ability to speak is motivational, and without a doubt his knowledge of NLP is the real deal.That's why I was disappointed in this 50 minute CD. There's not enough time to go in depth about the topics, he throws a few lists out there and jumps around in his subject matter.I'm a fan so it's hard to be critical, but unless you can pick up a used copy for a couple of bucks this just isn't worth it. Instead, spend one extra dollar and buy his book, Unlimited Power. There you'll have 300+ pages of in-depth, paradigm-shifting material that will have a much greater impact on your life."
3,A GOOD BOOK,"Robbins deserves credit for mass advertising the concept of NLP. I like this book better than ""Awaken the Giant"", less fluff and less pro- moting his other products and $3000 seminars. The NLP techniques are only a partial solution, and not an end in themselves. Easy reading. I also highly recommend ""MAXIMUM ACHIEVEMENT"" by Brian Tracy and the 'SILVA METHOD"" or any good book on alpha waves for maximum mental repro gramming. ""SUPERSELF"" by Charles Givens is probably one of the most under rated self development book. I don't agree with ROBBINS nutritional ideas and have not found one person including nutritionists who either recommend this regimen or have any measureable results by using it."
4,Very Good CD - The Book Is Much Much Better,"The BOOK version is excellent - everyone that wants more out of life must read it. The CD is a very good but does not compare in regards to detail, but it is good for reinforcement. I was hoping the CD would be a straight read of of the book but it is only a small portion - 60 minutes."
2,a few good points,"The audio version of this book is too short to be really helpful. I believe that Robbins really wants to share his secrets for success but I'm not really sure what his secrets are. He mentions NLP but a five minute explanation isn't going to help anyone practice this. Overall, a waste of money."
5,A Truly Outstanding Book,"This is one of the best book that you can find if you are determined to attain self-mastery and would like to lead your life sucessfully and with confidence. It is a really great book and by the time you get to the end, you would already have felt that you have unlimited power!"
4,interesting,its a good audio tape. it teaches a lot of lessons and makes you realise what you dont consider to be important is very much valuable
3,t changed my life,think no need to say a lot of think.This book has changed my life.Now i am more determined and decisive.now i know i can do what i want..Thanx Robbins
3,Great Anthony CD but the Nightingale Conant Version is Better,"If you like to listen to a quick information and inspirational, I mean literally quick. This CD is for you! If you like a detail and deep substance materials, you won't like this CD.First of all, there is only 1 CD in the package, it is hard to try to put a lot of information in 1 CD.I think, the Unlimited Power 6 tapes/ CDS series that is released by Nightingale Conant company is a lot better than the one that Simons and Schuster. It is too short and Anthony Robbins didn't really go into details on how to apply what he is talking about on this CD.I still think, Anthony Robbins is a great motivational speaker! He is awesome! He has stories that you and I can relate to.About this CD, I guess the price is right, the simons and schuster series is a lot cheaper than the Nightingale Conant one. So if you want the generic and cheap version of this CD, buy the Simons and Schuster one."
3,Good quotes and thoughts but it gets repetetive,"Unlimited Power has a lot of potential, it tells you how to handle a situation or problem and how you can face it. But the contents do get repetitive at the end. A lot of rubbish and the diet for foods does seem unhealthy. Personally for me it seem like an average book. I had a lot of mixed feelings with it. A lotof good ideas and also a lot of not so great ways to run your life."
1,Too shallow,"Overall, it has some wonderful ideas about improving yourself. As a Tony Robbin's fan, this has to be one of the worst projects he has done. The depth he usually gains in most of his projects is non-existent here. I was very disappointed. He has tried to cram so much information into such a small amount of time that I kinda felt that this should have been free to get people to learn more about his system. Paying for this was really a bad judgement on my end. Spend the extra money and get the program and understand what he is trying to teach. His ideas are life changing but you lose that impression with this."
1,If you've nothing better to do with your money . . .,"Anthony Robbins is already a multi-millionaire, so it's a fair bet that you need your money more than he does.Many of the reviews for this book claim astonishing results from reading this stuff. [Why some of these people have waited a year or more before writing a review is something of a mystery. ;) ]So, you might want to ask yourself ""Did Robbins get where he is by reading books?""Not on your life. He went and got NLP training with Richard Bandler, then toddled off and started selling his own version of Bandler's ideas.This book is poorly written, far longer than the amount of useful information can justify, and gives a highly misleading impression of what NLP is all about.So, if you really want to help fill the Robbins coffers, by all means buy this book.If you want to really understand NLP I'd suggest you do fresh searches on NLP and on Richard Bandler. But only if you want real value for money."
3,too long and you would lose your patience!,"I am a reader from Hong Kong and ""Unlimited power"" has recently been regarded as ""one of the 10 best books"" in the local community, therefore i was motivated to pick up and read the book. In one sense, the book is worthy of reference, it gives some very useful tips to readers to build up a more ""powerful"" self. However, chapter after chapter, i found that the book, the original english edition i read, is too repetitive, not only of its points, but also of its language. Sometimes it would really be too frustrating and it is such a waste of time to read just a point over and over again elaborated in several chapters. Keep the writing clean and concise and let the book be less shallow would be my suggestion to the author."
3,Great! But too short!,"This was the first audio tape of Tony that I bought. Well, the way Tony gives seminar is really admirable- he's really energetic, funny, congruent, and he gets his points across effectively. Most of the section is recorded from his real seminar, and it's great! However this version is a little bit too short, maybe it's Simon & Shcuster's fault cos they always release such short audios. There's another version of Unlimited Power, it has 6 cassettes, it;s a fuller versions with lots of NLP skills. That version is released by Nightangale-Conant if I'm not mistaken. I listen to that 6 tape sets every now and then. The format is very similar to this tape, with Tony in studio and seminars teaching you the skills, but this version is only about 50 mins long."
3,Good for the Little You Get,"There isn't much meat on the 50 minute audio. The CD itself - for what you get - isn't half bad, but it struck me more as a well recorded infomercial than anything that will be truly transforming. I was certainly hoping for more meat on the bone, and a longer presentation. Tony Robbins is a captivating speaker and author, and what you do get here is good stuff - just not enough of it to really justify the buy."
3,Curriculum & Development,"This book has a lot of great information but is completely overpriced for what it is, not worth the $100 for a paperback book."
4,A Model for Local Historians,"This history of the town of Leixlip in Ireland is an excellent example of the historian's craft. John Colgan has focussed on a small town with a vibrant history spanning more than 800 years. With its proximity to Dublin, Leixlip witnessed all the great episodes of Ireland's turbulent history, from the invasions of Vikings and Normans to the exploits of the IRA. Colgan cleverly covers an immense amount of detail by arranging the book in encyclopedia format so that the reader can proceed straight to specific items of interest. All in all, a delightful compendium of previously unpresented historical material."
4,a bloody history in abloody regeion,"i love this kind of books .as a person who is living in the middle east which lived a lot of wars and conflicts between the arabs and the israeles i alaways search on the books talk about such a topic . this man mr halevy because his possision as a post leader of mossad explains and clears every thing about the middle east crisis. in a good degree of objectivety in a way that gives the reader who does not no any thing about the middle east a good background he is simple , clear , no complcations as he is chating with you or as when our moms told us stories before sleeping when we were young . it is a book you can read in the week end , in the holiday , in the tunel before going to the work >"
1,Not what it purports to be,"I'll state upfront that I was reading the first edition of this book, not the second, so perhaps some of the flaws I saw were fixed in the second edition.I found the first edition of this book annoying. I'm a parent, trying to run a chess club, and I was looking for readable tournament rules. This book IS readable, but it's filled with clunky definitions, what looks like a tiff with the USCF, and also several typos.I also do not appreciate the word ""Official"" in the title of the book, which vastly misrepresents the book's place in the chess world.My recommendation is to buy the latest edition of the real ""official"" book: the ""United States Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess."""
4,Great book (if it fits your expectations...),".Buy this book when:(1) You want to learn how to integrate XML in your Internet/Intranet-based infrastructure. (The title mentions 'Web Applications'... do not expect the book to focus on 'Web Sites'. It's more about XML as a storage mechanism, the secure exchange of XML messages over HTTP,...) (2) You value the insight in how experienced developers model their application (using Design Patterns, reusability, etc) (3) A very readable book.Do not buy this book when:(1) You're looking for information the latest implementations of XML Parsers, XSL Transformers (the book was published before XSL became 'established'), XML database servers,etc. (2) You're looking for complete, useful applications you can re-use 'straight-out-of-the-box'. (3) You're looking for information on XML as a way to manage the content on your web side."
4,This is a great book for server side xml,"This book provides fantastic information, it is well written and has an excellent structure. However, when I bought this book, I was looking for front-end manipulation of XML rather than back-end. This book is almost exclusively about getting XML from servers and then getting the XML transfered to HTML through an LMX processor (which I think is a terrible idea). I was looking for more information on stylesheets and presenting XML. This was a terrific book, and I learned a lot from it, but I just didn't learn the lessons that I was hoping to learn."
2,Not What it said,This book is not what it says it is. I have to know too much to get what I need. I'm glad I ordered St.Laurent and Cerami's book (Building XML Applications) at the same time. It's much better and it's saved me from too many more headaches.
3,Not a very useful book if you plan to use IBM 4 Java v2,"I'm a Web Application Developer for Source-W in Pittsburgh and we had to do a project using XML and Java so I thought this book would be great. I did not finish the book yet but I tried some of the examples with some of my own input. My mistake was that I used IBM for Java Version 2 instead of the IBM for Java version 1 that the came with the book. The result was that some of the code didn't work even with the input supplied by the book. Basically if you don't plan to use the new API then the book is very useful. But if you will be using new version of IBM for Java, don't plan on using all the code in this book as reference because it won't work."
3,excellent book but covers only XML4J,Very good designed book. Easy to understand but it covers only XML4J and only the older versions.
1,Worst XML book I've ever read,This book doesn't cover the details of XML and Java and the realtionship between the two.
3,Watch out for the pre-requisites; Also: emerging technology,"The book achieves its purposes, but take care with the following items:Pre-requisites, to read the book I relied on my knowledge of:Tree data structures, parsing, HTML, HTTP protocol, HTML Forms, Java, Servlets, cryptography, beans, JDBC, cryptography, digital certificates, relational databases, SQL, JDBC, systems architecture for the web.The book does not teach XML, it teaches how to USE XML. So, before reading the book I read a quick introduction to XML downloaded from the web.Emerging technology:XML is quite new. A lot of reviewers said that this is the best book on XML applied, so I am quite happy I bought it. But I am looking at buying the ""Java and XML"" book from O'reilly that is at the moment (Jul-2000) on back-order."
3,pegs were crooked,"Bought them as a gift and delivery was fast. However the pegs were not even and some could not even be put in the pegboard. To their credit, they did send replacements."
4,works in my pressure-cooker,I use this dish not for souffles but as an insert to my pressure cooker (p.c.) for casserole-style rice cooking. Works great in my 6-qt Presto p.c.; also fits my 4-qt p.c. but doesn't work quite as well (maybe it needs more headspace).
4,Oldies but goodies...,"I'm crazy about author Echo Heron who writes books based on her real life experiences as a CCU nurse and also writes fictional stories such as Fatal Diagnosis. In the fictional stories, the main character is Adele Monsarret, CCU nurse, who works full time but also likes to use her intuitive skills to help the authorities solve patient crimes (whether the authorities want her help or not). I love this author's humor which is woven throughout the story and in the dialog between she and her dedicated fellow nurses who are all a bit insane...they have to be in order to deal with the daily crises on their shifts.I read a couple of Echo Heron books a number of years ago and just recently filled in my back list from Amazon-used print copies. Her books, I noticed, are also available for Kindle and Nook. Fatal Diagnosis was published in 2000."
5,Super book!,"Anyone who enjoys reading medical mysteries, and especially those who've enjoyed the previous installments of the Adele Monsarrat series, will enjoy this book.The characters, especially Adele, Tim and Cynthia, continue to develop in this page-turner!"
1,not up to par,"I've read and enjoyed Echo's previous books, but I found this one tedious and overly detailed. I never made it past page 60."
2,Enchanted Vagabonds,"This first adventure book by Dana and Ginger Lamb describes how they sailed, paddled, towed and hacked their way in a custom-built canoe/sailboat through open seas, estuaries, lagoons and mangrove swamps -- from San Diego to Panama in the early part of last century. The book has a melodramatic flare, perhaps due to the era it was written: Nearly every day of their 3 years is fraught with high seas, gales, pounding surf, murderous locals, malarial mosquitoes or killer ticks entirely covering their bodies -- and always a crafty or miraculous escape (except from malaria). Although there are respites describing friendly, hospitable ""natives"" they meet along the way, this was a disappointment after reading their later Quest for the Lost City, a better-written book in which they describe how they walked and camped from San Diego to southern Mexico and then spent month upon month exploring the jungles bordering Mexico and Guatemala."
3,"INTERESTING, BUT TRULY UNBELIEVABLE","Interesting read, but if any two of the many mis-adventures happened to me I would have stopped the journey. Seems to have been embellished. I've been canoeing with my wife many times and something fun/interesting/dangerous will happen. they consider themselves the ""GOOD GRINGOS"", but by todays standards, maybe not so much."
1,to expensive,"do not purchase. it is not the worth price. it hardly says anything. big mistake to purchase. go online and read, you will get more info"
2,Get this one at the library!,"Although this wasn't the worst book I've ever read, I thought it was pretty boring. The characters in this book are dull & boring and it has a slow-moving plot. If you must read it, either get it at the library or a used book store. I'm sorry I paid full price for it."
3,The Distraught Dad,"Former NYC cop Coop, recovering from cancer treatments and a bitter divorce, is struck yet another terrible blow when his daughter is brutally murdered. There's something ritualistic about her death, and Coop can't ignore all his training, all his instincts, and allow the police to handle the investigation. It's not long before he meets an eccentric true crime writer, Deni, who believes there's a serial killer skulking around. Soon she convinces Coop, but the authorities aren't buying the theory.Naturally, there is a serial killer, and the remainder of this plot should come as no surprise. There's lots of talk, a new love interest, and the dogged pursuit of evidence, which is sparse. The climax is predictable as well, but what breathes life into this thriller is the appeal of this detective (labelled by the newspapers The Distraught Dad) and the sporadic, cat-and-mouse-style of suspense. I never knew you could murder someone with a can opener!"
4,Very good,"First book read by this author, enjoyed very much. Already got another, will read soon. Probably Lutz will be an author added to my list of Dave."
5,Nice book time,It has it the man run around do things have it been!Do it with its part having to do it with!Lots of fun and things of that nature.
2,Once in a lifetime,"I too felt that at times this book was boring and hard to digest a lot of it just didn't make sense I really didn't understand Alexis at all trying to force feed her daughter with her no good father,also she had a Master degree and it seems to me that she was dumb as hell come on ms forester get a grip this book was weak, the heroine was weak in matters that really counted. She acted illiterate and uneducatedit was just hard to swallow her bs. I won't be so quick to read anymore of ms forester books for a while she needs to step up her game some of there urban books waste too much time on trying to change the past or stuck in the past you can't change the past only the future and why would you stay stuck on stupid time waits on no one"
3,Characters great story slow,"I am very familiar with this author and style so I expected the typical romance story. However, it was somewhat slower in the romance and confusing with the random subplots. The missing Melanie side story was sort of dumb as was the mysterious past meeting of Big Tip. Those things that Alexis made such a big deal, really weren't much of a suspenseful surprise. I mean once revealed they seemed stupid. I pushed myself to the end but really if not for the great supporting cast of Tara, Russ and Henry, I may have given up awile before. This was a sort of boring romance and I think there are probaly better once out there."
2,Same Old Story,"I don't know what book the other reviewers are writing so kindly about. This story drags on with very little to compel it foward save the contrived missing young lady and the secret of their previous meeting in college. Ms. Forster uses the same trite and stilted language that she has used more effectively in her earlier work. It is like she is writing the same story over and over again, just less effectively with each subsequent book. It has taken me two weeks and I have yet to complete this book. That never happens to me!I keep trying to give her chances to strike lightning again, but to no avail. I may never buy another of her books. I give up..."
2,I Love Gwynne Forster But..,"The latest novel by Ms Forster was a bit of a disappointment for me. This book at times made me wonder what characters were speaking and plot twist jumped in so fast that it was sometime confusing. Alexis and Telford gave us what we wanted in the end - their togetherness but getting there was a little bumpy! Romance stories often stretch our imagination greatly and I found myself reaching too far. The other brothers Harrington however, could make an interesting sequel and since I do love Ms Foresters' work I will keep watching for the next insatllment."
3,Worth a listen.,"Geoff Downes is one of my favorite musicians. I truly admire the work he has done solo-wise and in other groups (Yes and Asia for example). The songs that he covers on this album are songs from other groups that have influenced him. For example, he covers ""The Final Countdown"" from Europe and ""Africa"" from Toto. This isn't one of my favorite albums, but there's no doubt that it's worth a listen. He's a great keyboard player."
1,WHAT ON EARTH HAS GEOFF DONE???,"Really bad cover versions of Geoffrey's most influential music. However, it just doesn't sit right compared to the solo efforts, and I have a very simple rule; i.e, if you're going to do cover versions, at least make sure it is substantially equal or even better than that of the originals, otherwise leave it alone. Geoffrey has some songs sounding so cheesy, that it is actually embarassing to listen to. Not recommended to anyone but a Downes completist!"
5,Earnest,"Respectful and not pompous though decidedly academic this book reaches out to honestly describe why people go clubbing. Yes, it is about dancing, and drugs, subjects for which words hardly ever do justice. Nevertheless, for those who have an interest in trying to describe the indescribable, this is one of the more readable and agreeable attempts. However, even as I've quoted sections to friends (yes, they're worth quoting), I am left with what another dancer told me quite spontaneously: she likes to dance, be it merengue, salsa, cumbia, because, as she says, I feel closer to God. I suppose it's just one of those things that you either understand or you don't."
4,A little jagged but still pretty smooth,"This suspense novel is quite good for a first time author. Although you are let in on ""whodunit"" from the very beginning there is still a desire to read the cat and mouse game between the killer and female Homicide Detective Paris Murphy. The book is fairly predictable but the great writing and the intriguing and likeable heroine make for an exciting time. The ending also draws to a satisfying conclusion.If you like mysteries a little on the dark side this would make a fine reading choice. I look forward to reading something by this author in the future."
5,"Buy it, you will love it","I wish Theresa Monsour has written more books, she is a great writer. I would compare her to John Sanford style wise, however Paris Murphy is very much different than Lucas Davenport is in Sanfords books. I can't wait for the next book!"
2,Unworthy of all the praise.,"I did not enjoy this book at all. I can't understand why so many of my favorite authors wrote very positive blurbs for this formula mystery. I fell for the hype and bought this book in hardback and I am sorry I did. Heed this warning, if you're going to read it, buy it in paperback or get it from the library."
2,The worst of the Wager series,"There is too much mystery and not enough romance in this book. The hero's character, which certainly seemed promising from the first book in the series, is poorly developed and shallow. The heroine likewise is poorly crafted."
1,PICTURE,"VERY misleading picture, the picture shows two blocks with the bolts. I received the package and only the bolts were included. This cost me lots of time and spent more money in the long run. I would recommend dealing directly with Rough Country."
3,Has potential but never quite delivers,"Sometimes humor, especially in a comic book, succeeds by being extreme (think Three Stooges, or Monty Python on a bad day), but this send-up of World War II special-ops commandos, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The first half of the book, which is the first three issues in the original series, introduces the six cliched characters, including an upper-class git as the captain, a gay lieutenant, a pathological giant as the sergeant, a lower-class corporal, ""Hank the Yank,"" and (for some reason) a Scottish piper who is the captain's family retainer. Three of them never say anything beyond a single cliched phrase, and the piper never speaks at all. The Nazis are similarly borrowed from Warner Brothers. The second half of this collection is about the quest to capture the Fuhrer's mystical missing testicle, and it's somewhat better, if only because of the song everyone sings to annoy the Germans. But still. Bugs Bunny did it better."
4,Will Make You Feel Good All Over,"Pianist James Williams leads a somewhat unusual group that integrates a jazz quartet (piano, sax, bass, and drums) with vocalists--there are two male vocalists in ICU, plus several guest female vocalists on various cuts--the end result being a really entertaining blending of styles, with a strong feeling of the church underlying it all. This is not a religious album, though--it is clearly more jazz than not. The sound is original, the outlook is fresh, and the end result is hugely entertaining. james Williams and ICU are clearly a group that warrant wider exposure. How refreshing it is to audition a CD that is both different and entertaining! These guys will make you feel good all over."
2,"Misleading item description, only 11 wrenches","I had two problems with my order of this wrench set.First of all, the description is misleading. It says that it is a 12 piece wrench set WITH rack. But the 12th item IS the rack, there are only 11 wrenches included. The description should either read: '11 piece set with rack' or '12 piece set INCLUDING rack'. The rack is really flimsy and practcally useless by the way but I wasn't planning on using it anyway.The second problem was that the packaging arrived broken and only 10 wrenches were in the box. The 5/16"" was missing. Hopefully this particular problem was an isolated incident but I am waiting to hear back from the seller (Midway) to send me the missing wrench.So, I searched on Amazon for a 12 piece wrench set to fill the 12 pocket wrench roll case in my car and got only 10 wrenches."
5,GREAT ALBUM,I tink this album is great.I am 20 years old so this movie came out bfore my time but i grew up watching the movie my aunts and uncles would watch it and for my 16 birthday my dad bought me the album.I know every word of every song. I definatley recomend it!!!
3,"great performance, but there's better","This is the first recording I ever heard and I loved it, but since I have heard better. I gave this three stars for three great performance that need mentioning. First, Ted Neely gives a stellar performance as Jesus. I saw him live in JCS in 1995, some 22 years after the movie, and he's even better now. Carl Anderson gives a remarkable and moving performance as Judas. And Barry Dennen give an incredible performance as Pilate, however whoever plays Simon drives me up a wall and josh Mostel as King Herod annoys me to no end. If you're a fan or just a collecter buy this, but if you're looking at something new get the concept or the london revival cast."
3,"Good, but the original is still better","While the movie version of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" was interesting, it lacked the depth and charisma of both the original rock opera and Broadway show. Ian Gilliam's (from Deep Purple) performance is vastly lacking here as Jesus. While the cast here greatly performs the opera in movie form, it doesn't have the magic of the original."
1,A pathetic attempt to recreate a great musical,"Being 15, I wasn't around when JCS first came out, but my mother was. I found the record one day when looking through my parents collection, I immediatly fell in love with it. When my birthday came around I asked for it, and was given the movie soundtrack. After hearing a few notes come out of Ted Neeley's Jesus, I had to shut it off. I was used to a storng powerful portrayl of Jesus, instead I heard a passive attempt of a role that could be so much more, if you want this musical, buy the original concept recording."
2,Could be better. By a lot.,"I've listened to this CD and I own the LD of the movie. IMHO, the casting could have been greatly improved. While I found Judas and Caiaphas pretty good, Ted Neeley made a rather wimpy JC, totally ruining one of my favourite songs from the show, Gethsamene. At times he seems to be screaming like a woman! If you want to hear it as it *should* be heard, go buy, beg, borrow or steal a copy of Michael Crawford's (yes, he of Phantom fame) CD ""Michael Crawford performs Andrew Lloyd Webber."" Trust me, it's worth it for track 7 alone, where he does the most incredibly emotive, anguished rendition of Gethsamene. It will bring tears to your eyes, and a new appreciation for the song. I never thought much of the song until I heard Crawford sing it-he really opened my eyes up to it's beauty."
1,Warning! These are not the original versions,"Warning, warning Will Robinson! These are not the original recordings of Jesus Christ Superstar that were released on Decca records in 1970. All are, what I would call, cheesy remakes. As others have said, the production and quality is lacking on this version. The lyrics might be the same, but the original powerful music production, arrangements and singing are sadly lacking."
2,Wretched recording - awful mixing of vocals and orchestra,"Just purchased this CD and believe it to be a re-mastered recording from the original sound track. I had purchased the original LPs years ago and was very pleased with the recording. The new CD is just awful in poor mixing of vocals, particularly the chorus and instruments for several tracks. The worst include disc 1/track 9 ""Simon Zealates"", disc 2/track 1 ""The Last Supper"", and disc 2/track 7 ""Could We Start Again"". It's just very sloppy and quite awful recording engineering. MCA/Universal should be ashamed to put its name on this. It's a shame because the singers, especially Ted Neely, Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elleman put their hearts into this film production and Andre Previn's conducting of the score was first rate."
1,"Great Music, Horribly Mixed","I am no audiophile but, Jesus Christ Superstar, what were they thinking when they remixed this CD reissue? Those who did this deserve to be crucified! The cassette tapes I bought the soundtrack on in the 80s sound way better. Lucky I kept them."
4,"Very good, but with one complaint...","Ted Neely as Jesus is wimpy. He lacks the vocal power needed to effectively deliver the role. In all of the Judas confrontation numbers, Carl Anderson would belt out his part (which was great, him being an understudy or not) and then Ted Neely would croak out his response, and I thought 'Yeah, you told him, alright...'"
5,The best there is!,"I agree with everyone who had reviewed this recording. It is the only one to have a listen to over and over again! I heard the 1996 London Cast and they're not too bad, but this blows it away! Ted Neeley is remarkable! Being a loyal Lloyd Webber fan you've got to get this! (better than the current cast in NYC). Happy Listening!"
3,"Great Music, Average Recording","The music is wonderful, but the remastered recording was done poorly and sloppily. What was the rush?"
5,ted neely is the best Jezus---live and on this album.,"in this version, Jezus is not angry or malicious as i have heard him portrayed in other recordings. Mary has the sweetest voice, like the actress was meant for this role! This is the best version of Andrew Lloyd Weber's JCSS! It is not too sing-songy as some of the theatre interpretations."
3,randy b,"AFTER GROWING UP ON THE ORIGINAL STAGE VERSION SOUNDTRACK,THE DOUBLE LP WITH THE WORDS INSERTED INSIDE I WAS A BIT DISAPOINTED WITH THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK. THE TWO EXTRA SONGS ""WERE DECIDED"" AND ""COULD WE START AGAIN PLEASE"" ARE REFRESHING BUT THE WAY THE SONGS ARE PERFORMED FALL A BIT SHORT OF THE ORIGINAL ALBUM."
2,Highly disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Jesus Christ Superstar and feel that the movie version is the best of all. This is the soundtrack of the movie and it does not do any justice to the movie at all. The quality of the CD is terrible! There really needs to be a re-recording and reissue because this is inexcusable.If you are a fan of the movie like me, then other than watching the movie, this soundtrack is the only choice, but do not let the five star reviews fool you. You will be disappointed.If this is going to be your first introduction to Jesus Christ Superstar then please do yourself a favor, skip this CD and get the DVD instead."
1,Worst remaster ever?,"For the DVD version I would give this a 5-star rating. However, as others have pointed out, this 'remaster' actually sounds worse than the original 1974 vinyl version! Everything sounds like it was recorded in a tin can, and there is an annoying silence inserted between every track for no apparent reason other than to ruin the flow of the album. What were they thinking? The way they treated this great music borders on offensive. If you want to hear how this music *should* sound, get the DVD or even VHS."
3,Audiophiles Beware! Terrible Sound Mix,"I gave this three stars because no matter how bad the sound, the music is that good. Still, it's hard to believe that this is a remaster. For some reason they decided to mess with the fine mix from the LP and, instead, crank the vocal parts way up above the instruments. Sample some of the cuts and listen for yourself--if the LP is drilled into your head (like it is mine), you'll notice the difference. ON THE OTHER HAND, the sound mix on the DVD is pitch-perfect, which makes the screw-up with the CD all the more baffling. Tip: buy the DVD and rip the tracks to mp3 using freeware like DVD-MP3 Ripper."
3,Some gems and some lost in translation,"The movie soundtrack of JCS is a mixed bag for the JCS fan. On one hand, it has essential gems not found on the original cast recording or many others. ""Could We Start Again Please"" and ""Then We are Decided"" were written for the film and are welcome additions to the story. Extended or alternate lyrics in Hosanna and the Temple are bonuses for the collector. Yet this is a far cry in quality from the original, both in sound quality and voice talents (esp. Herod). Some of the problem no doubt is that the context of these songs in the film are lost in translation to cd. But it's also just not as good, and some aspects sound dated (ie. sound ""70s"") moreso than other renditions. In sum, to non-fans, don't make this your one copy of JCS to own--get the original. To fans, this supplements the original with new material and alternate interpretations that I think are worthwhile."
2,Music from a tin can,"This is the poorest recording of this production I have ever heard. I can't believe I spent this much money on it. I would have been musically better off ordering the DVD instead of the MP3. The sound quality is horrible. It sounds muffled and tinny, like it was recorded in a box. It's pretty bad when the sound quality of the original vinyl, scratches and all is preferable to the sound of a digital recording."
2,Mary Magdalene????,"I have the newest version of the Jesus Christ Superstar performance with Glenn Carter, and I must say that it's exceptionally better. Even though it lacks ""This Jesus Must Die"" and a couple of other songs (which by the way I'm very mad about!), Mary Magdalene played by Renee Castle does SUCH a better job than the MM from the 1973 version! Talk about one huge yawn! Also, Ted Neely looks possessed in this film. Sorry, but Glenn is so believable and Ted is just plain scary to me! I think that the newer version is all around improved, and after seeing both films, let's just say that a newer version was quite in need. I admire the originality of this film, but the 2000 version is much better."
4,Literate dialogue flavored with farce and metaphysical angst,"This is based on a book from the early career of Mr. Blatty, which is titled TWINKLE TWINKLE KILLER KANE, that original being broader in comedy and, by the author's admission, pretty sketchy. THE NINTH CONFIGURATION, however, is tightly crafted, thought provoking and can evoke great laughter as well as suspense. If you could mix the zany sensibility of the Marx brothers with the incisive speculation of R.D. Laing, you might have some idea of this fair. A unique and lasting piece of entertainment."
1,What a joke,"This is the buggiest game I have played in years. I have 5 high end systems. NONE OF them can play this stupid game. I use only name brand products in my systems. Creative labs sound card etc. I can run all of the latest games on their highest detail settings. Not this one. I cannot even run this game on the lowest setting. I want my money back. It crashes without warning. Pixelates my screen, locks my sound card up, and it is junk. Absolute junk. Wait till they are trying to give them away do not spend money on this game."
2,Buggy software and tedious gameplay,"This game has so many bugs which to this date, are not fixed. I have the latest patch which is supposed to have fixed the big ones - such as the safe opening issues - but it hasn't.A part from the bugs, the missions are just tedious, not really much fun, like previous series.Control is awkward, evidence of a bad port from console.My advice is to stay away from this one."
1,Disappointing and buggy,This iteration of Splinter Cell isn't nearly as fun as Pandora Tomorrow or Chaos Theory. The controls are a step down (from not that good to begin with) and the missions are terribly dull compared to previous games. Maybe it gets better later on but I never got past the first few missions due to repeated crashes and constant bugs preventing me from loading my saved games.
1,tom clancys double agent,"the game started out great and about half way thru the game would shut down when you tryed to save the game . even the auto save would shut the game down, could not contiue, try patches, rebooting , re-installing the game , but it kept locking up on the saves,,, very disappointing had to quit playing could not get it to stop shutting down....."
2,Game was great but stability and service is not,"Like the title says this game is great but it is buggy, way to buggy to be played and enjoyed at the same time. I dont' know why it was for me, maybe because I downloaded it (from here Amazon) lol I'm not some pirate ar'. SO maybe the physical disc one works perfectly. I donno. But i doubt it. Maybe a 60:40 chance it will be the same.So unless there is a fix out there the eluded me. This game is a no go."
1,WARNING,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T HAVE VIDEO CARD THAT HAS SHADER 3.0.My comp isAMD FX-552 gigs of ram2 daul video cards each at 256 mem hooked up to three 19 inch monitors250 SATA hard driveand i still can't run this game.
2,Bugs mar an otherwise stellar review,"I would love to give this game 5 stars overall - but I can't. The game is exceptionally fun to play, with great graphics and excellent stealth play alongside a well-thought storyline. The BUGS, however, are too much! The game crashes each time a new level loads. At one point it required a complete reinstall, because after one of the crashes it just wouldn't fire up anymore. Save games get overwritten without notice. The ""Quick OPSAT"" button is buggy. Once I hit reload on my weapon, and lost all weapon functionality entirely - couldn't shoot, couldn't reload, couldn't put the weapon away. These bugs bring my overall review from 5 stars to 2... which is a complete shame. My friend has it on xbox 360 and it's a stellar experience, showing what kind of quality title it *could* have been. It's a real shame that the PC did not receive the same attention to detail and quality production that the 360 did."
1,Do not even think about buying this game,"Loaded this 10gig monster on my pc (P4 3.4 2 gig + Nividia 6800) which ran Bioshock (a game 2 years older than this) OK.First cut scene slow and jerky- resetting graphics doesn't save right, next time you go in they are reset to highest settings. Known bug, check the net.Character response time is SLOW. Tried training missions, can't see anything as they are artistic all white rooms with really bad wireframe wall definitions.I'm literally thinking of throwing this game in the trash. I am a huge fan of Splinter Cell for the XBOX, did not get an XBOX 360, got a new computer instead.Ubisoft has done an injustice to everyone who bought this game. As I said, Bioshock loaded and ran fine on my PC and graphics card.Do not buy this game unless you like reading various internet help forums."
4,Splintering Action,"Great Game, a great addition to the series. Invovled story line in which your choices have a visible effect. Open level design gives you more than one way to accomplish most missions.If you are running a Nforce 8800 card beware, the gaem was not tested on your card. Try moding the short cut with -LL after the executable and it seems to run okay (not super stable).All In All I really enjoy this game."
5,My processor feels like a whipped pony now,"I played this with 1 gb memory,an MSI dedicated card,80 gb hard drive and and very angry celeron 3.2 processor that feels like a whipped pony trying to race on Churchill Downs with the big guys.It ran a great race and I'm proud of it.I had Vista installed and had no problem.You really need a good system to play this game. I tried to play it with integrated ATI EXPRESS 200 and could n't load up. I would always crash and get a windows graphics error message. The problem was I didn't have shader3.0 .The msi took care of that and also helped vista aero graphics.The game itself is pretty good. For the price I paid for it it's a good buy and I would play it again.The game takes up 10 gb of hard drive space. I played it on an 80 gb hard drive with no problem but I would advise using a larger hard drive.It's a good game but demands a great computer.Don't knock Celerons as junk. It did the job although a Pentium would have been better."
2,SHAME ON UBISOFT!!!,"You know, the PC Gamers are what helped make Splinter Cell so popular and to release this buggy POS was a total slap in the face to a number of EXTREMELY loyal Splinter Cell gamers.Cannot bind mouse keys, game crashes to desktop. Just an absolute pile of garbage and a waste of $50. I am praying for a patch so that I can at least play the damn thing but the folks at UBIsoft obiviously did not have their hearts in the PC version and are focusing all of their time on the Console.I told my Nephew the day we can configure a Mouse and Keyboard on an XBox is the day the ""real gamers"" decend on XBox live and they won't know what hit them. I guess the PC Gaming days are drawing to an end.DAMN!"
1,Evidence of the death of PC gaming,"I dont know what planet D. Ackerman lives on. The game is far from solid.Yes I have a killer rig too and yes I get to see some pretty nice graphics.That my friends is where it ends.False advertising - Unlocks dont work at all.Save game corruptionsCrash to desktop on many occasionsMultiplayer module is pointlessI managed to have a bit of fun in a few parts of the game but its not worthit if you have not bought it yet.This is just another example of the death of PC gaming. All the moneymaking is on the console side. This is a blatent grab for some extra cashfrom the PC owners. It's so VERY obvious litte to no QA / Beta testing wasdone on the PC version.Warm up and practice your mindless joystick twitching PC Gamers, its the future...."
3,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of the Splinter Cell series, but I found this one disappointing. The game drags, and I found myself quitting after short periods of play. In the end I got so bored I never finished it."
1,buggy POS,"I don't usually review games, but this one was so buggy I gave up trying to play it, and had to warn others to stay away from this one. Couldn't even get through the first level. It's a shame since Chaos Theory was one of my fave games of all time. btw like most here my system exceeds system requirements -it's just a bug ridden piece of software (even w/ the patches applied). Shame on Ubisoft."
1,Disaster,"The splinter cell series double rocks. The double agent double sucks. Just doesn't seem to have the continuity of past games. Then again, save games sometimes don't. Makes it kind of hard to follow it when you're screaming about starting a whole section over again because it didn't save where you left off.Pretty much a lesson in how not to code a PC game."
1,EXTREME requirements...for what?,"This game has mad system requirements. When I bought it, I had to upgrade my video card so that it would support Shader 3.0 (The game doesnt look that fine trust me, it would have run on 2.0 perfectly, developers are just alienating 2.0 users). Anyway, after upgrading to a really expensive video card, I had great expectations, I mean, a game that has 3.0 shader as a MINIMUM system requirement has to look awesome right? well no, it looks exactly like any other game I ever played on my 2.0 Shader card. On top of that, the game is buggy as hell and really boring when compared with the other Splinter Cell Titles. My final recommendation? get those bills you were going to use to pay for it and burn them, much more fun in that than this stupid game."
4,A Major change from previous versions,"I have all three versions of Splinter Cell and this version is a major change from the previous two. The only downside I could find was some of the scenes are too dark. Otherwise, excellent game, highly recommended."
4,Bike,"well, lets keep it short.For this money it does the job.Just don't do to much off roadas the bike is not build as strong as one of those expencive mountain bikes."
3,Uncomfortable,"The bike comes with the hardest seat I have ever sat on! Also, the way the seat is so far above the handle bars, or it seems that way, makes my wrists hurt."
1,SORRY Cymax!!!!,"I ordered a bike for myself for my birthday. I have YET to recieve a tracking number nor a reply to my ""wheres my bike"" email. I am unable to cancel the order because thats NOT one of my choices for available actions. I could have gone to a scrap metal yard and made my own bike by now. I guess that once again, I have gotten the short end of the stick."
4,Great boots!,"This was my third pair of this kind of boots (last ones bought on 01/2009) so that should say something about them. They are pretty light and comfortable compared to other ones I have bought (timberland) and I just love the water resistance up to 6"" (and believe me I have tested them). They do get a little bit uncomfortable after a 12hr shift if you are standing up all day, but I am sure that would go away with a different insole, I just never really HAD to buy one. Each pair lasts me about a year, though this one is still in pretty good shape after over a year of refinery work. another great thing is that I found them for $40 cheaper here on Amazon.com compared to the store :)"
5,Simply Cute,"I bought this book, while researching for a play ""John Lennon and Me"". This book is really cute, colorful, and VERY enjoyable. Not only did I enjoy it, but the cast of the play also enjoyed it as well, young and old, we all liked it. John Lennon's play on words is great. The captions are simple, but perfect. I would recomend this for any John Lennon fan, or just any one looking for a sweet/cute children's book."
5,A nice collector item,"Happy to have found this book for my son. Also, being a Lennon fan, its nice as a collector item."
2,Wonderful Book and Collector's Item,"I received this out of print first edition in mint condition. I was going to give it as a gift, but when I opened the box and saw what a wonderful book it is, I couldn't give it up!"
1,Not recommended even at the price,"Although the price is nice and they are cute I would not recommend. The ""thingy"" on the top is always in the way when you want to slip them on. It goes inside and is extremely uncomfortable. You must stop and pull it out. Even if you tighten it up the slippers still do not work well. I fell off the sole when I was turning and hurt my ankle. These slippers looked similar to some Dearfoam slippers that I really loved. They may look similar but that is all."
3,Comfy but heavy sole,"I gave this away as a gift. Slipper looks exactly as advertised but the company was Christies as in the pictures and not Slippers International, unless they are an affiliate? I was told the fleece is comfortable and warm. However the rubber sole is a bit heavy and I would not recommend it for an elderly person."
1,NO CUSHION!,These are not worth $5 let alone $30! I bought them thinking they looked so warm and comfy. Well they have absolutely NO cushion in them. It is like walking on the floor! They are warm but not anymore than any other Walmart slipper and my daughter has a pair that are twice as cushy from Walmart. Thumbs down on this slipper!
2,wore out quickly,the soles of the slippers started shredding after 4 wksthe inside soles came out and were twisted
4,"Warm, comfy, and durable.","These slippers are warm, comfortable, and the rubber sole is durable enough to handle quick trips outside. I ordered a size larger than my regular size and I am glad that I did."
5,Makes me get up and dance,"Love the songs on this cd. There's not one I don't like.My favorites are 'It Would Be You', 'Don't leave her lonely too long','I've got a quarter in my pocket', but like I said they're all great."
5,ABSOLUTELY A FABULOUS CD,"Gary Allan puts what every man/woman has ever felt in his songs, and they really touch your soul. I dont know which cd of his I like better. All I know is right now, he's one of the best country radio has to offer."
4,Solid,"A good book which gives an overveiw of the various topics of cinema. If you want to know what one of the ideas are, read this book. Great for writing papers in the sense that it is concise and accurate.However, if you want a real in depth understanding of the topics covered, you'll need to look farther. This is a great starting place for any of hundreds of topics covered in the ook!"
3,Nuevas Canciones,Grabaciones diferentes a las originales pero no dejan de ser buenas ademas de que hay canciones nuevas para la gente de Mexico que quiza aqui no alcanzaron a ser escuchadas pero vale la pena tenerlo si eres fan autentico de la verdadera y unica cumbia
4,A little dated but a great reference,The articles presented in this book definitely provide a good foundation of concepts required for FRM and Financial Markets.
5,Software,Best policy I've ever come across. Comprehensive recommendation for complying with software policy laws. Written in an easy to understand format.
1,compatibility problems,"I loved the first in the series so i bought this one too. Unfortunately it has serious compatibility issues with vista and won't install or run on a vista machine. this might not have been an issue with me, but it's not mentioned in any sources i could find until after i had purchased the game and pounded my head on it for a while. then i gained access to the company support site. THEN i found a ""known compatibility issue""."
2,maybe three degrees,beware the jewel case has both cd's on top of each other. the cheapest packing product i have ever seen in over hundreds of cd's.i guess they never heard of double jewel cases.
5,Hung by the word,This book was a short but powerful read. It talks about alot of really good word and really makes you think about how we really use words. Awesome book!!!!!
5,Hung By The Tongue,"Wonderful Book! I'm buying a case of them and send them out to all my friends who hang themselves with their thoughts and tongues!I loved it as much as ""Who Moved My Cheese!""MKH,California"
1,Are You Kidding Me?!? Disgusting Graphic Arts,"This may be on of the ""great"" all time Christian books to tame the tongue IF you can stomach the jacket cover. I am shocked that a pastor would approve this graphic arts design. Based on this alone I will ""pass"" on thinking this book would be helpful for me to read. The copy I have in my hands is fix'n to run through my shredder and then dumped into my compost bin."
1,Greatly Disappointed,"I was hoping by the title of this book that I would find Scriptural incentive to speak words that strengthen others and build healthy relationships. Instead, what I found was more of a self-centered, ""name-it, claim-it"" theology. If you enjoy traditional, 70's style Charismatic literature, then this book may very well appeal to you."
5,Wha'cha say?,"I didn't know this book existed until I finished a set of cds and it was suggested reading. I found this book to be very helpful and informative. I did have a hard time with some of the Bible verses, because I don't read the KJV, but I read the New International Version (NIV). Yet, regardless, I was able to get through the verses just fine. I would recommend anyone who is looking to boost their self confidence and improve their life. It is a very uplifting book. Hung by the Tongue shares how the words from our mouths are not always uplifting for anyone, including ourselves. It suggested you take a look at how you are speaking to your self, what are the messages you are giving to yourself and how it impacts those around you. Words are powerful. They can bring you down, just as easily lift you up. Hung by the Tongue reminds you that were created to be a blessing and you are blessing to those around you. It suggests you watch what you say."
3,One piece of very valuable advice,"I struggled to read the book fully since I do not believe in God and this book was all from the perspective of a God-fearing soul. But this offered some tremendous advice - the power of words that leave our mouth. In fact, one example stood out - if one is arrested in the US, the cops ""recite"" some sentences. Almost always that starts with ""You have the right to remain SILENT. Anything you say may be used against you in the court of law...."". That was a big eye-opener! As they say in management - ""When in deep s**t, keep your mouth shut""! Watch what you say! Read this book! And if you are god-fearing, you will reap much more postives from this book."
4,What we say from our mouth is powerful and self-directing.,Speaking our world into reality is going to be what we want or what we don't want. If we want good things to happen we must first think and speak those things. More powerful than we know are the words that come from our mouth each day.
4,Hung by Tongue,"Great read from the very first sentence. Very informative,thought provoking. What's most impressive is the amount of scripture used to make the connections. It seems a lot of my other readings are copies from earlier writings. A must read."
5,Great source of material on the Challenger accident,Challenger Accident is the best single research source I've found. This electronic book is easy to use and very thourgh in the material that was produced from the investingation of the loss of mission 51-L. A great value for the price!
3,The name of the product is a little overzealous,"I would say that product works, but a couple of my nails still cracked and I had to cut them short. I gave it a little time before I wrote a review because I thought maybe it needed time to work, but a month and a half after using it as the directions read every week, I am still not seeing the result that I wanted.The product is better than nothing, but no better than plain clear nail polish."
5,Great Stuff!,"This product really works and I recommend it to anyone who's trying to grow nails..In the drugstores I can only find the duo set which includes the top coat ( by the way the topcoat has awesome shine). But I'm happy I found the single bottle on Amazon I have too many bottles of topcoat now. You will use this over and over again because it works..** make sure to keep this product off of your cuticles because its very drying and makes them hard as well.Dry cuticles impact the nails too"". I learned this lesson the hard way and ended up clipping my nails. Try toKeep the cuticles moist ladies. :-)"
3,Excellent for sunblock but not for driving,This article is excellent to block the sun in the morning but a bit tricky to drive the car with.I had an accident because of the greencontrast and not seeing a green car.
2,Not recommended,"The product description did not mention that there is no CD booklet to speak of. There are absolutely no descriptions or notes on the works, nor any biographical info about the conductor or orchestra. The lengths of the individual tracks are not even given. The small print says this CD was manufactured by Amazon, though the label is Naxos. It was probably printed as an ""on demand"" order. The orchestra sounds like a second-tier, regional ensemble. I will be looking elsewhere for a good recordings of Sibelius's 3rd and and 4th symphonies. This recording does not do justice to this great composer."
3,It's an okay read...,not what I thought it was going to be. I'm glad I found it @ a used book store for only $1.50
5,"User-friendly, practical tips for helping young readers!","As a parent and a former teacher, I want to help my children learn to love reading. So many books have been written on this subject, but most of them have a bit of an axe to grind. They promote only THEIR OWN philosophy about the ""best"" way to teach reading--phonics vs. whole language vs. literature-based instruction. That's why Shirley McEnnis's book stands out, far above the crowd. She understands that every child has his own way of learning. She therefore advises for a BALANCED approach to reading instruction. I wish I had had this book when I was still teaching, but I am DELIGHTED to have it now that I have young, new readers at home. It offers tips, guidance, and easy-to-follow suggestions for games and activities that make reading FUN. Along the way, it has also built up my confidence. I CAN make a difference in my children's attitudes and aptitudes for reading. Thank you, Ms. McEnnis!"
2,Holes will not fit in a Binder,"The log will work fine as a standalone, but the holes are not punched propoerly to fit in a binder. That's probably why it is available so cheap. You can punch your own holes and make it work though."
3,Holes in wrong place,"Unfortunately when I received this, the holes were punched in the wrong place. Rather then send back, I had my husband drill a new hole on his drill press. Now it fits in my log book. Otherwise, 5 stars."
5,Mozart's first piano masterpiece.,"Mozart's piano concerto no. 9 in E flat major (""Jeunehomme"") has long been my favorite. The first movement in particular seems to embody all the qualities that make Mozart's music so wonderful: a main melody line that is in turns winsome and soaring, a conversation between the soloist and the orchestra, and a sense of majesty that no one but Mozart could conjure up.This Naxos budget disc measures up to the piece with a clear, precise sound that belies the budget price. Jeno Jando's piano playing is a revelation: delicate when it needs to be, firm when the music demands it. That he is not a more renowned performer seems unfortunate."
1,mis-labeled,"For those considering an Amazon Instant download of this Sinister Cinema release of the obscure 1961 TV pilot ""Witchcraft,"" beware: What you get is the lame sitcom pilot about a house haunted by the ghost of Robert E. Lee which is actually the second half of the Sinister ""Witchcraft"" DVD. Sloppy job all around."
4,Great Book!!,"This book was one of my favorites. But I don't get it, in book #50 it was Rolex now Lyssa's training for Rolex. What's up with that? Even though it didn't make sense this book grabbed me from the start. I read the whole thing the afternoon I got it. This is a great book if you like danger and exeitment and you don't mind a little confusion (about Rolex) than this book's for you."
4,what??????,what happened to racing? is this before cassidy moved to kentucky? or is it after? help me pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeee. i don't get it
3,Not Bad...,"This book was a pretty good, but it just didnt fit with the series... Honestly... I really had very little interest in reading about a stolen horse, but the author must have written it for a reason, so maybe it ties in later. Not what you would expect in this series, but not a disaster..."
1,Shoddy construction,"This is not a well-made instrument. The bridge falls off if there isn't enough pressure in the string and the string is attached by a screwed-in metal hook. There's also what looks like an off-center pencilled-in circle drawn beneath the finish. It sounds about as nice as a rubber band stretched over a cereal box, so as either an instrument or a decorative piece, I don't recommend purchasing it."
5,A refreshing look at how language works,"When is an entire sentence a metaphor? How certain can we be about determining what is hyperbolic and what is not? Can we determine how prophecies will be fulfilled by how they have been fulfilled in the past?Mr. Sandy explores the nature and function of language, and the power of that language in its poetic setting. A must read for any serious student of prophecy, to remind us to be humble in our interpretations of eschatalogical events."
5,New light on the language of biblical prophecy,"Plowshares and Pruning Hooks is a book for the serious Bible student, written by a Greek scholar.It explores the often-mysterious language of Bible prophecy with scholarly depth, but is stillaccessible to a lay person. Sometimes controversial and always thought-provoking, this is aworthwhile study. Disclaimer: I went to college with the author and have a high regard for him."
1,not what i ordered,if you check my file you will see that i first ordered this book on 6/16 for my son's 30th birthday party on 7/30.it arrived a week or so later with no dust jacket. i have spoken to many people by phone about this and a second one was overnighted to me on 6/29. still not right.on 8/3 i spoke with Saurabh; he said he will fix the problem in less than ten days. i got nothing so on 8/13 i called and spoke with kultar. he said he had the problem under control and would personally see that i got the proper book and cover. the price has gone up from 47.96 to 59.95 but kultar will issue a promo discount of 11.99. on 8/21 the third book showed up with no cover; this time i spoke with lee; he said he will be sending me a fourth book and a label to return the third book so i can get my money back for that one. obviously my son's birthday has come and gone with no book. frankly there is no excuse for ten weeks to go by with no book.
5,Great stuff!,I order this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. Anyone who eats with us and tries this sauce loves it as well. I have ordered before from Taylor's Market and will do so again. They always arrive quickly and the bottles are well packed.
5,Best Tasting Hot Sauce!,"The Pepper Plant Original California Style Hot Pepper SauceIt's spicy but doesn't burn. My family is hooked, and we put it on everything. Try it on grilled fish for something a little different."
5,Love it!,"My husband and I love this stuff! We tried it for the first time about 10 years ago at a small steakhouse in central California. We have kept it in our fridge ever since. We used to be able to buy it in the grocery stores in California, but since moving to Arizona we now purchase it online. We love it with grilled New York steaks."
3,it didn't work for my daughter,"My 14 year old daughter was very excited to receive the Zeno for Christmas. She used it several times on her very minor blemishes and asked me to return it because she said it didn't work. We were hoping it was be a ""miracle cure"" but it was not. I suppose there is no real cure for acne after all."
