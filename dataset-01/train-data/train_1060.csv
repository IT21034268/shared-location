5,GREAT BOOK!,"I didn't use to read books, but while I was deployed to Japan, I came across this book and changed the way I feel about reading books. ;) This day I just placed an order for 3 more books because of the inspiration I got from reding this book. I strongly recomend it and encourage any musician and singer that are true worshipers to get this book and read it. The author did a great job ""keeping it real"", allowing the reader to be able to identify with it. May God bless you and prosper you in everything you do."
2,Transsexual history lesson,"The author and subject of this autobiography is (was) a long lost relative of mine, so I found it fascinating. That said, I would only recommend Mirror Image to someone who is struggling with his/her own sex change, or another member of the family who hasn't yet read about ""Uncle Nancy""."
2,CD made in Mexico,All except the manufacturing quality are good. The CD was made in Mexico. This should be made clear in the product description.
1,"Flashy, but poor quality","This cable appears to have a very solid construction, with a comically heavy over-engineered sheath around the bundle of individual component cables. However, it almost immediately started showing signs of unreliability, until it became unusable. There was a bad internal connection on the PS2-side of the cable, where the picture would randomly darken, or even go blank. Additionally, the Psyclone logo stickers, which look like they could be grip points, quickly fell off. I would not recommend this cable to anybody. For the same price, the Sony version is less bulky and far more reliable:Playstation 3 Component AV Cable(which is also PS2 compatible)."
1,"PS 2 Psyclone Component Cable, Not worth it.",Product worked well for games. However picture is incredibly fuzzy when watching DVDs. This product is not worth it. Bought a different brand from FRYs and it worked much better. Save yourself your time and money by not buying this product.
1,PS2 Component Video Cable,"DID NOT WORK WITH MY SLIMLINE PS2 - NO VIDEO -RETURNED FOR REPLACEMENT TWICENEITHER WORKED WITH A BRAND NEW 52"" BRAVIA LCD"
2,Protestant Septuagint,"I learned by accident that there are two versions of this translation. One includes the Apocrypha found in the original Septuagint, and this version that only contains the books of the Old Testament found in most Protestant Bibles. The English translation is from the 1850's and is very dated, almost King James-like. The English portion is also in a separate column to the side of the Greek text and not in an interlineal format. The English print is very small."
2,"Yes you will, too","I really can't say what happened to Stanley Clarke on this album. It's very spotty instrumentally speaking--yes, including the George Martin ripp-offs on the first cut. There's almost nothing here that resembles Clarke's work up to this point. Nothing with an edge, relatively speaking. Skip it--you won't miss it a bit."
1,I was highly disappointed,"Too many characters were introduced too quickly - hard to follow. I had to make myself keep reading. Usually I can get engrossed in a book, well, not this one. Under the circumstances of Maddie's marriage and wedding night - I would have felt raped. Highly disappointed that the characters never came to Christ. This has to be the worst Lori Wick book I have ever read. I really enjoyed ""Every Storm"", but not ""Moonlight On The Millpond""."
1,Dull and slow moving,"This is my first Lori Wick book and possibly my last. As the other reviews state, there is little action and what there is is so unbelievable. This was not a page turner and I would not read the second book if I had to buy it (I got it as a gift). If you haven't bought this book yet - don't. You won't miss anything."
1,Writer's Block?,I think it is safe to say Lori Wick has writer's block. She just can't get a good story out lately. This is not worth your time or money. I buy her books because they have her name on them and I have certain expectations because of that. Now I feel that just because it is a Lori Wick book doesn't mean it will be good. The book rambles and jumps around with too many characters. Worst of all it doesn't have an ending! Just finish it Lori! We don't want to feel conned into buying another book to find out what happens!
3,More like a Novella,"I am a huge Lori Wick fan, and this book did not do her justice. Maddie is a young woman who is living in Boston and illness in her family brings her back to her roots where she meets Jace. In my opinion, Wick spends way too much time dwelling on the same issues and the book lacks action and intrigue. However, I will probably read book 2, just not in a great hurry to do so."
1,Moonlight on the millpond,"I think this book, like another reviewer said, is written as if the author were 14 yrs. old. It seems like the book consists of the characters asking each other ""Are you okay?"" Not only are they immature in their faith, but in everything else as well. I thought it was hard to keep reading it. The fact that Maddie keeps worrying that Jace is going to spike her drinks to have his way with her is far out. Not Lori Wick's best book by far."
4,Good Story but...,I really enjoyed this story but once again it was not up to what I have come to expect form Lori Wick. The book started out slow and jumped back and forth between so many characters that I had a hard time figuring out who was who at first. And I wish that I had seen some more development of the relationship between the two people besides them manking eyes at each other going on a picnic and then falling in love. And please who has ever heard of someone that has no memory after just a few sips of liquer. If you really want to see Lori Wick at her best read some of her earlier works.
3,Did Lori Wick really write this?,"First let me say that I am a huge Lori Wick fan. I own every book of hers except the short stories collection. As one who has read AND loved almost every one of her books, I cannot believe this one was written by her. The dialog between characters was stilted and awkward. Some of the narration was extremely poorly written and seemed to be incomplete or thrown together at times. And some of the happenings are so outrageous and unbelievable that I could not melt into this book and become part of the story like I usually can with books by Lori Wick. Jace comes off as being extremely dull-witted because he keeps making the same mistakes with Maddie and alcohol. Overall, the story had potential to be a typically wonderful Wick work, but this one fell flat."
1,not her best,"I love Lori Wick and can read her books over and over. However, this one left much to be desired. I still haven't picked it up to re-read it. For me, the getting drunk to the point of no memory on a little alcohol is completely rediculous. You have to drink quite a bit to get to that point, so much so that she could probably barely stand... and no one would notice this? Anyway...a good story has to be believable, and this one did not pass."
1,Disappointed,"Try as I might, I can never seem to get into Lori Wick. I find her plotlines under-developed and completely unrealistic, the dialogue stiff and boring, and more often than not the characters aren't even likable. This is the case and even more so with ""Moonlight on the Millpond."" Jace and Maddie's characters are never fully developed, and their love story was boring and abruptly changed paces. One minute she can't stand him, the next minute they're making out. Then suddenly she hates him again...and then the next morning they're married. You could hardly feel sad when Jace's uncle died because you felt as if you barely knew him. The chapters skip around to several different plotlines that remain undeveloped and unresolved by the end of the book. This book was an utter disappointment.If you want good fiction with depth, development, and great dialogue, I would recommend Francine Rivers, Karen Kingsbury, and Liz Curtis Higgs."
4,Pleasant Reading,I read the other reviews however in contrast I actually enjoyed it. The characters were easy to follow and the storyline was very interesting. I really like the two main characters and look forward to reading the next book.
1,More of the same,I have read many of Lori Wicks books and find them all to be much of the same. This is true with this one also. Sometimes I think that Miss Wick just changes the name of the town and the characters. I also found that this book was written more toward a teenagers level. I also didn't appreciate it that the story doesn't end with this book. You will need to buy another book to find out what happens to the lead characters in this one. So I need to spend more money?? No thanks! It's not worth it!
2,Disappointed - again!,"Like some of the other reviewers have said, I too became a fan of Lori Wick several years ago and have just about every book she has written. However, like the last series she wrote - this book is a huge disappointment. The characters are so shallow and just unlikeable. I tried very hard to give her the benefit of the doubt because I have loved her writing in the past, but this just doesn't cut it. If you want a great Lori Wick book - read Sophie's Heart. I may not buy a Lori Wick book ever again; too bad because she really was a favorite."
4,Works better than anything else I've tried ...,"Fungus amongus. This is a zinc based product with the added ingredient of some form of alcohol. It stings a little, but is more effective than anything else I have tried. I think it is due to the drying effects of the alcohol along with the healing attributes of zinc oxide. I'll be ordering more since yeast infections are a common occurrence in the hot, damp climate in which I live."
3,not too shabby.,These are fun and at times laugh out loud movies that are a perfect thing to run on a night with friends over. All shot a time when anything was possible.
4,Great set of films!,All 3 films are fun. It's great to finally see The Arena in 2.35:1 widescreen. Here's hoping for a Lethal Ladies Volume 3!
2,"I am a fan of Shout!, but not a fan of this triple feature...","It is good to see Pam Grier's The Arena in its widescreen format, but this is not a particularly good transfer. This movie is the only reason I bought this set. At least Shout! put it on a single dual layered disc. But still, was hoping to see a better image of this drive-in classic. The other two films are pure filler. They, too are not very good transfers. Fly Me is from a bad print that is faded and has heavy lines all over the image (can you say grindhouse?). I feel bad giving this set such a low score, but I feel I need to pass on to the consumer what I really think. And I love The Arena and wished Shout! would have treated it better (like their other Pam Grier movies) with better transfer. I am still a fan of Shout! releasing these classics from the '70s but I can't recommend this particular purchase. I guess they all can't be winners. Buy at your own risk."
2,Corman's Lethal Ladies,"This is a 3 film collection, but Arena is the one worthwhile film here. Corman as producer actually pulls off a fairly realistic ancient Roman gladiatorial arena, this one centering on gladiatrix(women warriers(, which ancient Rome actually had; in fact, this may be the first film to exploit this theme. It's so-so as a film, but good for them, for getting it right first!"
2,another doctor book,"self absorbed, self centered book, hopefully useful for young md's. myself, at end of career, found little of interest."
5,Danielle Ofri does it again!,"Everything I have ever read by Danielle Ofri combines extreme intelligence and praiseworthy compassion. This book is no exception. Ofri's willingness to learn from her patients is quite impressive, given that so many doctors in this day and age do not think anyone without an M.D. has anything to offer them. The nature of the book allows it to be read in short bursts, which is a plus -- but, alas, she writes so well that the temptation to read through the entire book in a day, ignoring things like work and family, is great. I did that... and now I am reading it again, slowly, savoring the nuances I missed the first time. What pleasure! Definitely a high-value read."
1,disappointed customer,"It is not what you see, the bulb with the base. You get only the bulb. So be aware when you order. I sent the vendor an e-mail and never heard from him."
1,Not Under Any Circumstance....,"Lots of good music out there. So why should I, or anyone else, listen to somneone who is against his own country in time of war to the cheers of foreigners who hate us? Why should I or anyone support him or give him further attention? 'Oh, it doesn't matter...'. Yeah it does...if it really offended people they wouldn't listen. 'That's his freedom of speech' - yes it is, and this is mine."
4,Jerusalem is one amazing song!,"I like everything Steve Earle does. So it comes as no surprise that I like this album too. But the one song that stands out above all others for me is ""Jerusalem."" If you have any interest whatsoever in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict this song plumbs it to the depths. Almost no singer-songwriters (except Israelis) have attempted to write about the conflict & I feel enormous gratitude to Earle for taking the subject on and doing it such justice."
3,A Few Gems,"This cd definitely has some strong points but it's not without weakness. ""I remember you"" is a beautiful tune, one of my favorites but why the silly little bells in the song? It almost succeeds in taking away that soul-touching quality. ""The Kind"" also has some real beauty in it. Some of the political-commentary songs come off sounding a little trite at times; though I agree with many of the sentiments they lack originality. There are excellent songs on this cd, and if you like Steve Earle, buy it, you'll like it. But if you're Steve collection is just beginning, I'd invest in some of his earlier works before purchasing this one."
4,Good lyrics,"I really waited this album and have to say that during the first play it didn't give me same feeling that albums like ""I feel alright"" or ""Transcendental Blues"" did.However, it's getting better more and more I listen it. Still it doesn't get to the level that I expected.Much talked ""John Walker's Blues"" works somehow very well for me. Especially in the end when the arabic verse comes to the song. Otherwise I feel that songs that have strongest lyrics (no disappointment here!) don't have the music that would support them to the par. ""Conspiracy theory"" is good example of that. Or maybe I just don't understand all the tricks they can do with modern tech!Hopefully he's going on tour soon and plays these songs in solo tours as well, since they would probably work much better played in acoustic, at least I think so. Lyrics 5 stars, music 3,5 stars."
3,Yikes,"I love Steve Earle. He is now, and has been for at least the last 9 years my favorite americana artist.That said, he is starting to scare me. This album is all about rising against the establishment and condoning criminal behavior. I don't mind a little raging against the machine and questioning politics, but come on. He strikes out against baby boomers and politicians and tries to justify the actions of 1. John Walker 2. A convicted prisoner 3. An illegal, drug dealing, alien 4. A prostitute.I love Steve's story songs, but many of these are way too didactic for my taste.The few that aren't political are outstanding. The duet with Emmylou, ""The Kind"" and ""Shadowland"" are solid songs.I guess you should buy this album if you love original lyrics that make you think. Just don't drink the Kool-aid"
2,Steve missed the mark on this one,"Never thought I'd say this about a Steve Earle album, especially lately, but when it comes to ""Jerusalem""...save your money. It's long on hype and short on substance. The hype being the controversial ""John Walker's Blues"", about John Walker Lyndh, the American Taliban, which proved to be rather innocuous and boring, rather than the Woodie Guthrie-esque risk that it was billed as. The rest of the album isn't much better, though it picks up a little at the end. The only stand-out track, ""The Truth"", is an add-on from a recording session several years back, when Steve was putting together better music....I was particularly disappointed due to the fact that he had been on such a roll since he got out of prison: ""Train A Comin'"", ""I Feel Alright"", ""El Corazon"", ""The Mountain"" with the Del McCoury Band, ""Transcendental Blues"", and ""Sidetracks"" were all stellar. Guess even the best slip a little now and then. Hopefully Steve will return to form on his next album."
1,Worst album he ever did,"I am a big Steve Earle fan and own all his albums. But this one won't get another listen. It's not the politics (though maybe Earle should have reconsidered releasing ""John Walker's Blues"" now that Walker has admitted to aiding terrorism and journalists are starting to discover Walker had a hand in the ... of an American agent over there). Earle has always been a proud voice on the left. The music itself varies from dirge to cacophony, almost as if Earle thought that controversy could replace musicianship. Give me back the Steve Earle or ""Ellis Unit One"" and ""Copperhead Road"": the guy who combined social justice with catchy hooks."
1,Disapointed beyond words...,"I never thought I would write a bad review of a SE cd but its come to that, this is the first cd I bought of his that I just cant find anything good to write about. Usually i rush out and buy the day it comes out and listen to it for days on end, not this one, the songs have no meanings i can relate to and he sounds worse then ever. I just cant believe there is nothing good on here... for someone else this would be an average cd, but for SE its a low point... :( this is not up to the standards of El Corazon or anything else buy him for that matter... Oh well, I still have the oldies..."
1,Anti-American through and through,"3,000 dead. The NYC skyline permanently altered. And what is this clown doing? Writing and singing a lament for a first-class traitor. Ugh. Avoid."
2,Big ol' liberal bear,"Music critics will give anything with heavy-handed leftist lyrics deafening praise. I'm certainly no conservative wag, but this parade of rhetoric made me want to pull the soapbox out from under Earles feet. It is a dissapointment, since he is a talented musician, that these strong songs are accompanied by awkward posturing instead of engaging storytelling. I don't mind John Walkers Blues, though. I think that Earle approached that song deftly, and the non-political songs are good. Go ahead and buy it if you like overt political stuff in your music. I just don't think politics and art are a good mix (unless it's the coup.)"
5,Just buy it.,"It's really as good as every good word you've read or heard about. It rocks, it kicks ..., it hollars, and protests. Just buy it."
3,Not as good as his past albums.,"Steve has caught a lot of unneeded flak over the song John Walker's Blues. His prior albums have included songs using the perspective of a death row inmate ""Billy Austin"" and a guard on death row ""Ellis Unit One"" and this song is just another continuation of those prior themes.As far as the rest of the album, the material just doesn't live up to the high standards we have grown accustomed to."
2,"The ""right wing"" weights in I guess","It would appear that NOT liking this album is a lot like not supporting America's patrotic push. If you dont, then you must be suspect.As a long time Earle fan (Early Tracks anyone?) I was totally disappointed to find that Mr. Earle felt the need to beat me with his political views for almost an hour. While most of his CD's have often offered an alternate view of something political (and often times have forced me to think or rethink some of my own views) this one comes across as preachy, intollerant garbage.A total waste of time and a waste of talent."
1,Wrong Turn,"I love Steve Earl's music -- Guitar Town, Copperhead Road, Trancendental Blues, I Feel Alright -- all great CDs. There are bluesy, dowtrodden, blue-collar politics in a lot of Earl's lyrics -- the politics of the little man, the outsider -- but some of the lyrics on ""Jerusalem"" go much further and are actually painfull to listen to.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as some things here at home have brought out cynicism and venomous politics in some, and Steve takes that to extremes on this CD. It's a wrong turn for him, but he's taken wrong turns before and gotten back on track again."
5,Steve Earle has guts!,He ain't preachin to the choir here.Hopefully some of his idea's will rub off on the more conservative part of his audience. IMHO the best singer /songwriter in america for some time now. Another in a string of great CD's.
4,Woody lives...,"While not as musically adventurous as Transcendental Blues, Jerusalem is a tonic to the drumbeats of war surrounding this country circa 2002. Earle uses his unmatched ability to ""walk in another's shoes"" to tell stories of true power and empathy. Perhaps Colin Powell could sneak this disk into a Lee Greenwood sleeve and give Mr. Bush a new angle to view our post 9-11 world."
4,works great,"I love magnets I think any of them can help for a ton of problems, I own many different types of braces from the wrists to the knee and they all have helped with everything."
5,Fine verse,"It is crazy that this book should be out of print. What are publishers thinking of? The verses are a delight, though they become increasingly tragic as the book progresses - ""The Sea Bell"" is a devastating account of something like clinical depression, yet like many of the rest it has a strange beauty. On the surface much is easy-to-read verse, but often has subtle allusions to deep matters. Many links with ""The Lord of the Rings"" for those who know where to look, and, I think, an unusually personal account of Tolkien's own struggles to find beauty, wonder and enchantment in the bleak modern world - it is only coincidence that ""The Sea Bell"" is the only one of his major works for publication written in the first person?"
4,Would I Lie to You?,I enjoyed the continual story of Venus. I got caught up in her mother's illness and her emotional reactions. I was also very involved in her relationship with Jake. I pretty much figured that her and Airic were not going to stay together. I am always happy for a happy ending. I am looking forward to reading more from Trisha Thomas.
4,Awesome,I previously read Nappily Ever After and Nappily Faithful and I wasn't aware that there were more in the series. Once I found out I ordered all of them. Really good books. Thomas tops herself with every time she publishes another in the serious.
1,Thanks Publisher's Weekly...,"Let me begin by saying that I have not read this book. Thanks to Publisher's Weekly, I don't have to since they told beginning, middle, and end in their review. WTH? WHY? It's supposed to be a review, not a book report. I enjoyed Nappily Ever After, and wanted to read the next book, but I guess I won't bother now."
5,worked for me,"toyota 20R head backed off the thumbscrew to collapse the threads inserted tool in plug opening till the tool was below existing threads shot some tri flow on it through the hole turned the thumbscrew to seat the thread in the expanded position .If the piston is at TDC you may have to bar the engine over by hand to allow the tool to clear the piston. You gotta have a little patience to get is started properly ,work it like you would any tap out a little then in to clean the threads shot some more lube on it back it out slowly all the way out then clean any chips off the tool collapsed it and put it back in to do it again repeat backed it out cleaned the tool again lubed it up threaded it in from the top and backed it out bingo worked like a champ took about twenty minutes or so . Put a little never sieze on the new plug and fired it up runs good ."
5,Great buy,"The KD3545 was a steal for the price. Well made, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do- chase the threads from the inside, saving having to pull the heads off of the vehicle I purchased. I would recommend this tool to anyone in the same predicament!"
3,Pretty good album but...,One day Nile is going to wake up & realize they've made a whole bunch of egyptian metal albums. These guys have got to have other interests. Even Fear Factory realized you cant have a whole career around singing about robots. Maybe Nile should make an album about egyptian robots or just sing about satan like every other death metal band...lol
1,one word: BORING,"After a minute or so of listening, this music loses all impact. It's a fundamental musical truth that when you have no dynamic range, even the most balls out playing becomes dull. Add to that fact that the rhythmic figures are so simple (nearly everything is in 4/4, the accents are all on the beat, and the phrasing is dictated by the beginnings and ends of measures) and you simply have highly repetitive, boring music. This is true for nearly all death metal, and it begs the question: why do extremely fast players who are capable of doing very complex things write such boring, straightahead rhythms?There is nothing sophisticated going on here, there is nothing musical going on either. It's a flat out bore that makes the listener believe these musicians must have the intellect of a caveman if they actually enjoy playing this."
5,My favorite Nile..album!,I liked this album probably the best out of all of the others... It's a masterpeice... the quality on this is unbelievable... the first time I put it on I wanted to break everything in my room... It's intense... Nile didn't disapoint here!!!!!! buy this now before you buy anything!!!!!!!!!!!
5,This CD isn't possible,"I did not think that it would be possible for Nile to craft a CD with more technicality than they display on ""Annihilation of the Wicked"". However, I was very wrong. This is perhaps one of the most technical CDs ever. The drumming alone is enough to earn this CD a 5...George Kolias must have 17 limbs in order to play all those intricate drum lines. The guitar work is, of course, ridiculous, and the bass tries to keep pace with the rest of the music and succeeds. All in all, a highly recommended album for fans of the death side of metal."
3,A Sound Mob,"A twist on vocals, ""10th"" reverbs with what seems like Isaac Asimov's I-Robots humming to themselves. Takemura doesn't use real voices, he uses voice synthesizers for his vocals illusions and dog beats with toy instruments. The result is a sound mob of children's voices and choruses ranging from great to passable. My friends, who listened to the CD with me, tend to prefer the shorter pieces. For us, ""Astral Beads"" and ""Cons"" were the best tracks by far - definitely worth sampling. Many of the other songs dragged on a little too long, such as ""Lost Treasure"" and lost (pun intended) their originality quickly. If you are a DJ, this CD is probably very worthwhile for the cuts."
5,Excllent book for Java beginers,I was new to Java ( had previous programming experience) and used this book to pass Java certification in 6 weeks and in the first attempt. This is an excellent book to know about Java fundamentals. The Sample exam in the book is much harder than the actual certification exam.
4,A Programmer's Guide to Java Certification.,"The book is very good, but I was unable to get the mock engine as promised. I registered the book and sent numorous complaints to the publishers. The publishers don't seem to care. I am stuck with this book."
4,Main reason I passed the test,"I have about 12 years experience in SW dev (most recently management). I bought this book to help me brush up on OO dev, learn Java and prep for the certification test. Although this is not a good book for hands-on teaching or for those with no prior OO dev, it is pretty good for learning the material needed for the exam. It seemed to cover material in more depth than needed for the exam (especially UI dev). It was my prime source and I passed the first time with an 81 (61 needed to pass).I would definitely recommend this book to those prepping for the exam. If you are new at OO dev, start with ""Thinking in Java"" by Eckel. If you want a good course-type teaching book with good hands-on exercises try Deitel's book ""Java How to Program""."
3,Extensive coverage. Maybe too much,"If your primary concern is to become a Java Certified Programmer, then there are other books that will better prepare you than this one. The book contains double or more information of its contemporary's and while it's great to find out every little detail you might be inundated with information you would never need to know for the exam. I recommend The Exam Cram over this one in preparing for the certification exam."
5,comprehensive and essential,"If you're going to take the Programmer Certification Exam and you think you're ready... think again. byte b=1; b = b+1; // does not compile. byte b=1; b += 1; // does compile. why? Covers the intricacies and subtleties of the language with good practice questions after each section. I doubt if I would have passed without this book. The writing is excellent to boot. Software Engineer, Los Angeles"
5,What a great book. From Delphi to Java in less than 3 Months,"What a great book. I jumped into the Java wagon just three months ago. Your book ""A Programmers Guide to Java Certification"" is the best in the market for people like me that is coming from a Pascal environment (Delphi)."
2,Test Engine?????,"I was really surprised when I could not access Online Test Engine after registering the book on its website, as was promised on last page of the book. I sent an e-mail to publisher for my user-name and password but to no avail. Luckily I had 10 days exchange period, so I have moved to another book which comes with CD-ROM."
5,"Simplified, smooth and excellent","I have quite a few books on java. But none of them are as precise as this book. This book covers the topics precisely and to the point, does not wastes time in unnecessary details and keeps everything to the point. Buy it if you are planning to take the java certification exam."
2,You'll need more than this book to pass....,"For starters the questions in the book are NOT like those you will encounter on the exam, so don't think your doing yourself an immense favor by focusing on them. The book gives you a smattering of the ""general idea"" in a lot of cases and few actual use cases to work with/figure out. Important points are listed, but are not fully covered in the questions not to mention that the book concentrates very heavilly on topics that are NOT TO BE FOUND ON THE EXAM! Forget about applets, graphics, and swing (ie chapters 15, 16, and 17). It would be nice if they had concentrated more on java.lang.* garbage collection, and dedicated twice the space to threads and what happens with them.Make this your only source and you will fail the exam, period."
4,The best of the many certification books I read,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the book is so long. It took forever to read through the whole thing and was very tedious at times. The code and questions at the end of chapters was very helpful & challenging. Also the test at the end was quite difficult - but thats a good thing.
5,A MUST for those who wish to get certified!,This book is the best that I have come across compared to other Java certification.It is well-written and organized. I passed the exam with 86% score in 2 weeks!
3,"""it does not cover developer exam "" :(","Most people have not mention , It covers only programmer exam not developr exam.Since other books cover Programmer & Developer exam , be carefull before you buy this book. In particular those people who are working for developer exam, must be aware of the limitations. Also it cover lot of topics not required for the programmer exam like java documentation."
4,good exam prep and decent resource,"I bought this book, spent 72 hours with it, and easily passed Java 2 cert on the first try. This is an excellent resource for people planning to take the test. For people just looking for a general Java resource, you still may do better with ""Thinking in Java"" or ""Java 2 Core"".Anyway, I was highly pleased with how well written, thorough, and precise this was compared to most IS books I've encountered. My only problem with it was, as indicated by others, that it might over-prepare you for the exam. Swing is not covered on the test, nor is JavaDoc. (At least on the one I took, which covered nothing but language fundamentals). If you can answer the (quite challenging) prep questions in this book, you will smoke the exam.btw the % for passing the test is 61%, not 71% as this book indicates."
5,Be a Sun Certified Programmer,"You can do practice with this book and you you can easily score more percentage mark in Sun Certified Programmer Exam. Do more practice,do hard work. (God with us only) All the Best"
2,Same old professorial approach,"Someday I will find out why the impenetrable ""you will understand what I'm saying only if you already understand what I'm saying"" approach to technical books is so widespread when it's so ineffective. This book makes you struggle to figure out what the authors are talking about, and by the time you finish, it's time for bed and you haven't learned anything yet.Having discarded this book, I've just started looking at the red and blue Osborne Certification Press book by Sierra and Bates. I like it a lot better than Mughal, it's more like normal humans talking, and the explanations are better and quicker to grasp."
3,Not too impressed,"Having decided to embark on the Java Certification trail after 2+ years as a Java Developer, maybe I was expecting a bit too much from this book. I found the content a bit lightweight, the examples similarly so. There may be a gap in the market here for books for Java developers with a lot of experience who just want to be able to pick up the book, read for the things they don't know/ aren't too sure of, then sit the test."
4,Detail,"I have one year of professional Java experience. This was the only book I studied before the certification and I passed on the first try.The book is very detailed and it explains all the topics you need to know in depth. The pratice exam was a little bit harder than the ordinary exam.A tip: Make sure you study the early ""easy"" chapters good. I concentrated on the most difficult topics and went faster over the basics, and on the exam I did very good on the difficult questions and less good on the easy ones. The questions can be very detailed, and easy things you think you know might not be so obvious when you are confronted with multiple choice questions.Another thing I learned from the exam is that it was more open text questions than I anticipated. The book states that you will at most get a couple of those questions, but I had 7-8 of them.I really recommend this book if you want to be a Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform!"
1,"misleading, tricky, hard to learn","I found it scholastic and dogmatic in the bad sense; the examples are forced out and do not make (much) sensible sense, they are there just to confuse you more. Excellent for a textbook (that the students would hate !): hard questions, poor explanations.Plus: I don't need sooo much detail about for, do, while loops, and other language constructs, since the title tells me this book is supposed to be addressed to programmers :(Don't get me wrong: these guys know their stuff, they just don't know how to teach it !There !Sincerely, Larry Tobossoftware consultant, and ex-instructor"
3,Not the greatest highchair,"I have been using this highchair for about 5 months now and there are so many choices out there, I would not recommend this one. It is easy to clean and does adjust very easily up and down as well as recline back. The features that I do not like are that you have to use two hands to remove the tray and the buckle is so hard to fasten and unfasten. I have caught my finger in it a couple of times and it hurts- god forbid you catch your childs skin in it. My experience with other highchairs having a one handed tray removal as well as secure but harmless belt is much better than this one. Overall not the worst highchair but can find better for the price."
2,Decent Highchair,"I recently purchased the Combi Breeze Highchair Carribbean. Assembly wasn't so difficult, a little confusing though when atttching the legs of the highchair. I find that the buckle is very difficult to open. When the toy is not in the tray, it is difficult to clean out the food that gets into the slots that hold the toy. The brakes are difficult to adjust with my foot because the levers feel a bit flimsy. I really thought the chair would be a better quality."
2,"This book should be called ""How I Got on the Sally Show""...","..because that's really all it's about. The abuse, while unforgiveable, didn't make this book any more readable. For all the beatings, no one ever ended up in the hospital. I've read much more serious cases of abuse in books. The author seemed more intent on ""telling on"" his dad and bragging about getting onto a talk show than he did with actually telling his story. Where's the closure? You get the feeling he's still battling his demons. And what's going on with his parents these days? What's his relationship with his dad like now? You won't find answers here."
1,Book is a Joke!,"Personally knowing the author, Wayne Theodore, I can tell you that this book is a joke. He is not a survivor but still an abuser to all that come in contact with him, even to his own children. This book was written as another one of his get rich quick schemes. I think that it is discusting that this book is being used in schools for kids when Wayne himself, as he portrays himself, is nothing but an abuser.I urge anyone thinking of purchasing this book to do their research on this man to find out the truth themselves."
5,I had no idea!,I picked up this book because Wayne is a business acquaintance and I had no idea! What a story! I couldn't put it down! It's amazing to see the man he has become today after reading all that he's been through. It's very scary to know that this type of thing happens to children everywhere. Congratulations Wayne!
2,Only buy if your hands never sweat,"I have had three of these controllers. It works good as long as you are not buying it for the auto-fire and don't change the cord length while using it. I have had a problem with its buttons always sticking in the down position. I think this may be because my hands sweat alot. If you had a choice between this controller and another, I would seriously consider the other controller first. One of the pads I had, the usb connector came apart straight out of the box. These controllers are really poorly made. I guess I had my worth my money. It works great if you rarely ever use it, but then why would you need it!"
4,Great if you are tight on time :->,"I have many Tamilee Webb dvds and that's because she's a great trainer. She's very knowledgable and outgoing and motivating. That's what you want in a good instructor and that's what you get here. She makes this fun and not boring in the least.There are three toning workouts (one on the floor and two standing). You use basic moves and equipment like dumbbells (even for the ab workout). She is a good cuer and that helps you stay focused on your moves rather than trying to figure out what's coming up next. Each segment is toning - there is abs, arms and shoulders and a 'total body rocks' segment. It's not the toughest workout, but like the title suggests, it is good if you are pushed for time but want to do a little something. It has a bonus workout at the end using an X-ertube, but for the main workout, all you need is dumbbells and you're all set to go. I like this and recommend it to busy people wanting to tone up a bit."
4,Good overall,"Nice sectioned workouts. The best part about Tamilee is her calmness and friendly personality. I just love her. However, even though I like this workout, there are some drawbacks: I like to max out on weight based on body part worked, but this isn't really possible with this because it moves pretty quickly using the same weight throughout. But that doesn't bother me as much as the fact that she has a tendency to leave out chest (she does that also in her 'I want that Body' video), I can't figure out why. Otherwise, very good video indeed."
2,Tight on Time,Not quite enough of a workout for me. I'm a yoga intructor and needed a little more intensity to feel like I worked anything
5,Love this one!,"I love Tamilee's workouts, she's always great! I like this one for the short but serious workout segments!"
1,broken dvd,Just received this video and there is a problem with it. Nothing on my screen appears when I put it in my dvd machine. I returned the product and am hoping for a better product.
3,Paul Williams import,"The cd itself was fine but the cover was poorly scanned and copied. Pretty cheesy looking, like it was pirated"
5,Time and Tide,"I bought this CD just for Time and Tide. The entire CD is great, but oh the memories of Time and Tide!!Ture romance.Anne"
4,Not definitive but good,"Paul Williams is a very talented ,quirky individual who nevertheless has written some of the best mainstream songs of the middle to late 20th century. The collection in question here ,however, can hardly be considered definitive since it doesn't contain ""Out in the Country"" or ""Rainbow Connection"". That being said, it does contain quite a few songs that became hits for other artists, done in Mr. Williams' inimitable style. There are other interesting, less familiar songs as well and only one real clinker-the lugubrious ""One More Angel"". Until an affordable,more comprehensive CD comes along,this will do nicely."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST. DONE BY THE BEST,"Paul Williams has written love songs that seem to be the most personal and deep from the heart and soul. He truly is gifted. This collection of his songs includes all of his songs that have been so beautifully covered by The Carpenters and Three Dog night, as well as many, very many others. It also includes the only song Barbra Streisand wrote with Paul Williams,""Evergreen"". I wish this collection had included, ""With One More Look At You"", other than that, this is a fabulous collection. This can really set the mood. If you are failing at your own feeble attempts with your lady, put this in. Paul Williams seems to say what we all feel and mean to say."
2,New versions,"I bought this cd primarily for one song.(Down by the River)I have his other two good songs-(It never Rains...& Free ElectricBand)already. I was disappointed to see that they decided to replace the original song with a 1976 version, which I have Never heard before. They did this with many others as well.I really thought I Could trust Sony, but I guess they're not immuned to screwing up GH CDs either.What were they thinking?I guess I'll have to buy another cd and hope for better luck."
5,A nice little mystery that will leave you guessing,I just finished reading Melusine. This would make a perfect stocking stuffer for any teenager that enjoys a little mystery and imagination. Or is it imagination? Something to ponder.
4,Very Inspiring,"First thing I have to say is how surprised I am that this book was labeled for 10 year-olds and up, it contains violence and scenes where some of the characters are drunk. In the beginning of the book, Tessa is thinking of ways she would like to kill her stepfather-not very appropriate for a 10 year-old. This book was very good otherwise. It was emotional, exciting, and inspiring. K.M. Peyton is obviously very knowledgeable about horses and racing. One of my favorite books, but for younger readers under 12 I wouldn't recommend it unless with a parent's discretion.P.S., I wanted to give the book 4 1/2 stars, but it wouldn't let me do it. Anyone know how to give 1/2 a star???"
3,national velvet by way of dickens,"Given the subject - steeplechasing - it may sound ironic to begin by saying that I found the book to drag a bit. Although the story was intriguing, I felt it could have been compressed without removing any of the suspense. Also, the several shifts to the horse's viewpoint seemed to come out of nowhere, and several times I lost track of how old the main character was now and how much time had elapsed between crises. At one point, the bad luck being piled upon the horse was more than I could bear to read (especially when his pony companion was stolen). But what a gutsy heroine and her triumph seemed earned all the way."
5,Horse Maniacs Will Love This,"Great story , moving, suspensing, thrilling, another amazing story from K. M Peyton. Tessa's story was very much inspiring for me, I even started to ride better at my stables :) Strong character with a lot of problems, hanging on to one thing that made her life better: Buffoon. The writer's switch between the humans and how the horse thinks was very emotional, somtimes upsetting. I very much take each step into thought know when dealing with horses.This book would also interest non-horsey fans, has love, pain, adventure, and sports all into it. Fantastic."
3,AT LEAST TWO CLASSIC SONGS,"This CD is worth buying for ""Betcha Got a Chick On the Side"" alone. It is 7 minutes of pure funk. The vocals are stunning, and the beat is funky as hell. It amazes me that this song isn't more well known. It sure beats the hell out of the 80's junk they put out. The other show stopper on this CD is ""Going Down Slowly"". Again just 7 minutes of pure, unadulterated funk-disco bliss! ""Chainey Do"" is another funky, hypnotic, song that will keep you moving. The rest of the album, while quite good, can be bland at times. ""Sleeping Alone"" has nice vocal harmonies, but not much else. Another jazzy number is the tribute to Duke Ellington. ""Save the Bones for Henry Jones"" is campy fun, and would not sound out of place on a Bette Midler album. It does sound out of place on this album though. Better to buy the Blue Thumb compilation CD, it has ""Betcha..."" and ""Going Down..."" in their entirety, as well as standouts from all of their Blue Thumb releases. Much cheaper also!"
1,Very poor quality,"Are these fake Bodum Pavina glasses? The 12-oz versions I received have silicon seals which don't seal the glass - it fills with water in the dishwasher! Also one of the glasses cracked the first time in the dishwasher, and other has a 10 degree tilt. I hope these are fakes, as the previous 12-oz glasses I've owned are beautiful."
1,Absolute Junk,"Very nice elegant looking glasses. If you only LOOK at them and nothing else!These glasses aren't fragile, they are brittle, a big difference.I use many fragile wine glasses, etc and have not run across anything that breaks so easily.Using a coffee spoon, don't dare touch the sides. The smallest dink with the spoon and the glass is cracked.You need to be a surgeon when washing these, the slightest bump, cracked.So unless you have a maid you can blame for breaking these, and take it out of their pay, don't waste your money...."
1,Not all they're cracked up to be,"A wonderful concept that needs more work. These glasses look wonderful and they feel great in your hand. However, they are very fragile; one of mine broke on the inside by merely dropping ice from the ice maker into it. And, they do sweat ~~ just not as readily as regular glasses. I would not buy them again."
5,Keeps the Coffee Hot!,"I really enjoy these glasses,and they have become my every day coffee cups. The design is such that they really keep your coffee hot. Notice the outer wall and inner walls are not touching, creating a thermal insulation layer. In particular, notice the gap at the bottom. This prevents the heat in your coffee from being sucked down into the coaster or table the cup is sitting on.An innovative design, and perfect for those who enjoy slowly sipping a cup of coffee in the morning."
4,Everybody loves it,"When I have visits at home, usually I offer them some coffee. When I handle them an espresso in a bodum pavina they instantly fall in love with the tiny double wall glass.It is so tiny and perfectly built that people just want to buy them. Some friends even tell me that they dont make espresso but would like to have bigger models.The only disadvantage, and the reason for why I am giving 4 stars to the product is the piece of silicone in the back of the glass. Friends start to play with it and one of them removed it and now water stays in there."
5,Nice looking glasses,These are definitely nice and I have used them for a few months now with no problems. They also don't look of cheap quality.
3,Different Sizes,I really do like these as when I make my espresso they aren't hot to the touch. The weird part is one of them is little deeper than the other when makes my shots uneven. I make it work though.
3,Terrific but fragile,"These could not be better for insulation, light weight, elegant feel and looks, and, not being plastic, they are free from concerns about chemicals leaching into drinks. But they are very fragile, 2 broke in one week, one by tipping over on a thick carpet. Then another broke because another glass tipped over, the other glass did not break. If they could only improve their durability, I would use no other glasses."
3,pretty but short-lived,"I love these glasses and use them constantly but I've had to repurchase them a few times because they break at a drop of a hat. I'm sure you've read that in every review here. I enjoy using them for tea because I can see the various colors and it keeps my tea warmer longer than a mug. But I'm down to my last unbroken glass and I've had enough for now. I got the bright idea of purchasing a cup warmer instead and putting the myriad mugs I have to use. And the cup warmer is cheaper than another pair of these glasses. I might buy them for fun again in the future but for now I need a ""break""!"
2,HARD TO RESIST... BUT RESIST YOU MUST...,"I fell in love with these cups the first time I held them in my hands.With piping hot coffee suspened in beautiful clear glass, I was mesmerized. So began my ill fated love affair with these glasses. In space of few months I went through 6 of them. Yup...SIX...urgh!!!I couldn't resist. Even when they broke into little pieces at every bump or ill fated couple inches of drop in my sink, I had to get another set.Nothing kept my hot drinks longer than these beauties...even now I keep them in my amazon cart and feel the flutter in my heart that longs to hold them again...I must resist...I must resist..."
2,"""Appears"" nice ---- but","Beautiful glasses, unique design, but the glass walls are VERY thin. I would be especially cautious stirring anything with a spoon. If I had to do over again, I wouldn't buy these"
2,Far too delicate for use,"I bought two boxes of these...both arrived with a damaged glass. I wouldn't recommend buying these...if they do arrive, the glass is simply too delicate to use outside of a padded room."
4,cool little glass,"These glasses are very modern, stylish and pretty. When filled with hot liquid, the outer part of the glass is a little warm. The down side is that they are rather fat. If you have small hands, you might find them hard to hold with one hand. But they are very light, weighing practically nothing. They seem fragile, but not any more than stem ware. Would recommend, but not appropriate for or around children. These glasses are very nice and sure to impress."
3,Nice looking but...,"I love the design of these glasses. They look great. Unfortunately, whenever I purchase items like this I seem to always end up with something made by one of the less accomplished artisans. In this case, one of the glasses I received has a noticable slant to the inner area that makes it less attractive while the second glass has air bubbles along the rim. This is dissapointing when you are paying a premium for design.Others have mentioned how light they are. This is true. I was almost afraid to hold them in my big, meaty paws. I will have to see how they hold up."
2,What's with the silicone plugs on the bottom??,"I've admired these glasses for quite a while and NEVER remember seeing silicone plugs at the bottom of the cups...so tacky! Cannot be removed either, they are plugging up a hole at the base of the cup.These are going back sadly :\ As much as I used to love these cups, I can't get past the silicone ill see at the bottom of every drink. This must be a new 'feature' as none of the pictures ive seen have the plugs either. Also, the silicone seal/glue they used was done very sloppily as well..excess is streaked on the bottom of the glass. Such a bummer :( I'm assuming functionality is still the same, but id say at least 50% of the appeal of these cups is the appearance, and the silicone gaskets definitely ruin it for me.Anyone else experience this with recent orders or did I get an odd set? FYI I ordered these yesterday (Dec. 10) so anyone looking to buy these soon, be wary of the new design change(??)shame on you Bodum, I want to love these again."
5,wedding gift they loved! =),the happy couple loved the set!! Glad I got them three! Good quality and arrived quickly. AND the husband was thrilled to get something that HE helped pick out ;)
1,Dishwasher safe?? NOT!,"Bodum's double-walled cups and glasses are all suppose to be dishwasher safe...this is not true. Even using only the upper rack for washing the product will allow dishwasher water to enter the vacuum chamber...thus, you'll have dirty water sloshing around inside the glass with no way to escape. Try and get some satisfaction from Bodum!! Repeated calls to their NYC center are deadheaded and there is ZERO customer care...this company is a real joke, only the joke is on you!! Give their products a wide berth."
2,Hole on the bottom?,"I like the glasses, but I am not happy with the hole in the bottom. I understand the science behind it and what it is for, I just don't think that is the best design for glasses. I am disappointed in them."
3,Good glasses but broke too easily,"I bought two of them not long ago. They work really well. However, I simply dropped them from a not so tall espresso machine. Then they just broke... disappointed.."
4,Nice design,I really like the look of these glasses. Makes drinking whatever you want very interesting. Although you do get a bit nervous drinking from it because the glass is so delicate that you wonder if you'll break them.
2,"Great concept, but too fragile",Received 4 of these as a gift. They're like Tervis Tumblers only fragile. The ice dispenser on the fridge is enough to crack the inside and let the vacuum escape. Cheaper than crystal but about as fragile. (So check out the Tervis Tumblers if you want something that'll last a lifetime.)
4,Great product but SLOW shipping,I love these coffee mugs. In fact I ordered a set of six more but from someone else because this merchant is way too slow in mailing this out. Will not order from them again.
1,"Bought two, one has survived the first week","First one broke while I was rinsing it to try it out. Boy, those double-walled items create a huge amount of shards!The other one is nice....but for how long?"
4,"They do the job, but are fragile",These glasses do the job of keeping your drink hot while letting you hold them without fear of burning yourself. They look good and feel good in my hands. The outer wall however is quite thin and is very fragile. Twice now a knock against the counter or edge of the table has resulted in a glass that needs to be thrown away.
2,Glass Breaks Too Easy,"These glasses look great, and insulate well. But the glass is incredibly thin. Even though I tried to be very careful with them, one of them broke after being lightly knocked by another glass while washing. These things are very fragile.As for another poster... you shouldn't put these in a dishwasher, that is just asking for trouble."
5,amazon,The sevice was excellent and I love love the shot glasses the best for my expresso machine. I would purchase again.Thanks Acord14
5,New Design Improves Great Item,"The new silicon breathing pad on the bottom of these glasses really improved the sturdiness by equalizing the pressure on the interior and exterior. Unfortunately 1 of my 8 glasses had the seal come loose and I haven't gotten around to trying to fix it. The issue being I am attemping to heat the condensation that formed within the glass back out before resealing the silicon pad.For use, they are great. So much more comfortable than having to grasp a handled item. Never warm to the touch on the exterior. Lets you really see the foam layer above when making a Cappuccino. Would recommend to anyone."
3,Bodum Pavina 12-Ounce Double-Wall Thermo Glasses,"Pros:- Very cool looking- Design provides good thermal insulationCons:- Very delicate- Unwieldy to handle- Very light (they look heavier in the photo)If you're careful with them, they serve their purpose for hot/cold beverages."
4,Very Nice Cups - Keep Your Espresso Hot!,"I really like these cups. They keep your espresso hot and are EXTREMELY nice to look at. They offer a very pretty presentation for your espresso, especially when your favorite beverage is properly made and the crema is prominent. Why not 5-stars? They don't FEEL like espresso cups to me. The dual-wall design makes the cup feel very bulky even though they hold only a single shot. I also prefer a handle. But, it's a tradeoff and not one that would keep me from having a set of these cups (in addition to my standards)."
4,Great Glasses,I use these glasses daily to pull double ristretto shots for cappucino and I have no complaints. The glasses are a perfect size and keep the coffee hot. I've noticed other reviews complain about the glass being too fragile or the glasses themselves not feeling heavy or substantial enough. I haven't experienced either of these issues. My glasses have not broken despite my pre-coffee morning clumsiness. I would definitely buy these glasses again. As far as coffee equipment goes these are really inexpensive.
3,Nice But Not a great Value,"These glasses are fairly delicate so you MUST handle them with care. They are quite attractive/stylish as well. Other reviewers and the manufacturer loudly tout the heat retention properties of this glass. I found them minimally better than my old coffee mug for keeping my Joe warm. However this glass does allow you to comfortably handle it with steaming hot liquid inside it. Overall a good product but probably over priced in my view. A small prce to pay in order to ""rook mah-velous"" right?"
2,Bodum Pavina 9 oz tumbler,"While the glasses look nice, they are very fragile and the first of two was broken within a week of arrival. The second of the pair lasted almost a month."
3,"cool, but......","These glasses are everything they say, and they are quite sturdy, but I wish they didn't have that big stupid ""BODUM"" etched-stamped on the bottom of the glass. It really ruins the entire appearance."
3,"Nice aesthetics, but too fragile!","We recently bought these in the 12oz size. They are really fun to use; I enjoy the novelty of pouring boining water in to the thin glass and picking it up immediately, and I like watching as steamed milk mingles with my espresso. The problem is that the glasses are too fragile. Two came out of our dishwasher cracked within the first week of use.I did love these glasses initially, and I still regularly use the two out of four that remained intact. I suppose if you're willing to baby them, they may be worth having . . . I'm still not sure myself whether or not I'll replace the broken glasses."
3,not quite what you'd expect,"pros:1. nicely designed.2. actually keeps cold beverages cold, and hot beverages hot.cons:1. they break way too easily. the glass is extremely thin and flimsy2. the bodum logo on the bottom is a bit of an eye sore3. the lip of the cup is inconsistent all around. its a bit thick and clumsily fused together-which you can tell when you put your mouth to the cup. it lacks a certain quality that makes it a finely/well made item."
2,no quite what i was expecting,"I was expecting something with a little more heft, like a shot glass, but these are insulated with air, and deceptively light, and tip over very easily. I will not be purchasing any more of these."
4,GREAT COFFEE CUPS,"While you need to be careful using this product (mainly when adding ice cubes), we find them great for coffee. I have also used as a cocktail glass on those humid days to avoid the ""sweats""."
2,"Great glasses, lousy shipping","I like these glasses so much that I wanted to send some to my sister in Colorado. I ordered two sets of two so would have four altogether. She reported that all but one arrived smashed to bits. I called and Amazon promptly offered to resend. I requested better packing or an alternative shipper (the first was UPS). The second set arrived via USPS with two of the glasses again is shards. Amazon told my sister this was a common problem, and they could not resend a 3rd time. They did send her a gift certificate, which she appreciated as in lieu of my gift. Nonetheless, I am very disappointed that Amazon cannot figure out how to have these packed properly for shipment. Though the product itself is very nice, I am compelled to report that the packaging is inadequate, so you are taking your chances if ordering. In other words, you may wind up having to go through the hassle of calling for replacements or refund."
4,"Pretty good, but pricey","Well, there's isn't much to these. They're thermally insulated, but really, there isn't enough liquid in an espresso shot to stay warm and you drink it too fast anyway. I also have the large Bodum mugs for coffee and tea and those are great.There are two reasons why I didn't give them 5 stars.1. They're very expensive2. There are sometimes imperfections in the glass and the hole at the bottom takes away from the visual appeal.That being set, I am planning on buying more!"
3,Nice glasses but they do sweat in a humid climate,"Bought these on a whim to fill out $25 for free shipping. The feel in hand is nice. Bit thick on the rim. Seem very delicate as other have stated.My disappointment comes from the fact that despite their claims, they do sweat water with ice cold liquids in the glass. It's not as much as with an uninsulated glass, but plenty to make them slippery to the touch. We live in Hawaii if you wish to gauge the climate. This time of year the relative humidity is not super high but still high."
4,"Break very easily, but they are very pretty.","We saw the other reviewers that said they break easily and when we got them we thought ""really?"" they look to be super study. The glass is thick and they look very pretty. :) But, then my husband was cleaning them after just two weeks of use and he accidentally dropped one of them on its top of the rim and it shattered into a lot of pieces. SO, just be careful."
3,Sides insulate well. Wide top allows fast cooling.,"With such a wide mouth on top the contents can tend to cool more quickly that you might expect. Still, you can pour magma into the cup and still hold it because the sidewall insulation is great."
4,Will Keep Your Double-Shot Hot,"These glasses are pretty nice. Yeah, I guess they are a bit fragile compared to say...a beer stein, but if you handle them in an average way they'll be fine. I think some of the reviewers drink too much coffee and are a bit ""jittery"" if you know what I mean. These are nice looking too, and keep the espresso hot without burning your hand when you pick them up. I like em. Think I'll buy some more."
2,Not worth it,"These cups are made of extremely thin glass and are as fragile as they appear. Within several days of use, one broke from an accident that a normal glass cup would have survived. Ultimately, this defeats the point of owning the cups in the first place. The main reason in buying these is to have the aesthetics of a glass cup without the tendency to break from thermal stress (as normal glasses are wont to do). If the glasses are this fragile, they AREN'T EVEN WORTH BUYING. They're pretty, but just not worth it."
3,the glasses isnt perect,"in 2 of 4 glasses there is a little bubble in the up edgewhere you put your mouth, and it feels rare because is irregular."
2,Break way too easily,"I bought a set of these some time ago and one broke in a little fall that should not have broken it. I liked the glasses and they do a great hot/cold job, so I bought another set.....I have a refrigerator with an ice cube machine in the door that makes 1/2 inch cubes. I went to get some ice and those little cubes broke a hole in the inner bottom........Wouldn't be bad if they weren't so expensive. Be nice if they were two tone, with a cobalt inner."
5,Used daily & work great!,I use these with my espresso machine to make my daily latte. The double-wall keeps your fingers from being burned while you pour the shot into your coffee cup. The size is perfect and I've used them many times w/out leaks or other issues.
4,nice but,"these break easy. Amazon rocks, sent replacement 2 day shipping. Careful, bodum does not warrant any of their glass products. Still, nice shot of espresso looks great coming to the table in these glasses. so far dishwasher safe. just be careful if you're stirring in them..."
2,A Severe Drop in Quality,"We loved these glasses and still use them every day for most beverages, hot or cold. But they are nowhere near as nice as they used to be, because the manufacturing has changed. They were previously a single piece of glass without any holes, and thus with a perfect barrier to create an insulating air barrier inside. Now they have a small hole on the bottom filled with a clear-ish rubber plug that pretty quickly allows moisture in so that you get internal condensation. There is also white writing on the bottom of the glass that you can see very clearly with a copyright message. The aesthetics of the product have been really diminished."
3,"Good glasses, treat with care",Cool appearance. Thermal nature definitely works. These glasses are very fragile though. I broke one just by it tipping over in the sink. Also shape makes a deft hand turn necessary to pur without dripping on the sides.
2,Broke after a week,"After having a great experience with the Bodum Pavina espresso cups, I bought the 8.5 Ounce glass. I was enjoying it for a week enjoying ice cold glasses of milk and cookies, italian sodas and the like all the whiel touching a room temperature glass. It was sitting in my sink and I picked it up to wash it and the thin glass on the inside of the glass broke inward slicing my finger something terrible. All of this from a glass that claims to be just as strong as regular glass even though it's signficantly thinner. While I was a believer, my painful finger has made me a skeptic. I also think it's costly for a product that doesn't last and may in fact be dangerous."
3,New model,"I have owned these glasses for some time. I recently ordered more. The new model is made in China and are of poorer quality. One has a rather deformed edge with an inward angled lip. Another change is instead of being sealed, this model has a hole in the base covered by a piece of ""water repellent silicone."" I remains to be seen if moisture will gradually get in and cloud them up, as happens with thermopane windows."
3,"Nice, but too fragile","A year after we received 4 of these as a gift, we only have 1 left. We tried to be very careful with them, but 3 of them still broke. I'd pass on these unless you are capable of being EXTRA careful (handwashing, no spoons to stir inside, and be VERY careful with ice cubes). They do keep my coffee warmer a lot longer, and even when I reheat it in the microwave, the outside wall stays cool. That's a really nice feature. They also look cool. Still, I'd never buy a product like this again. Sorry Bodum, nice try.EDIT: 2 years after purchase we no longer have them - all broken :)"
1,Not very durable,"These glasses have two big pluses: they are attractive, and the double walls prevent condensation on your furniture.But they are fragile. Drop an ice cube in one and the inner wall cracks or shatters.Makes them very temporary and awfully expensive."
1,Way too fragile,"This is for the Bodum Pavina Double-Wall Thermo Glasses 15 oz.The cool factor is undeniable, but please don't get sucked into it, as these things have the thinnest glass walls I have ever seen. I picked up a set of two, and out of the box I saw that one should have wound up in the same place they put three armed sweaters and other ""seconds"". Bubbles in the glass and the top had a wobble in the circumference so it wasn't quite flat. But I kept them 'cause they were cool.I was using the good one and it got knocked over on the table and broke into a million pieces. I have broken my share of wine glasses, but this was exceptional.For my twenty bucks, I have seconds quality glass that I don't see making it to the spring and a pile of glass fragments.These are certainly not stronger than ""normal"" glass.Maybe I got a bad batch...YMMV"
1,Beware,"On the first use with one of these glasses, I dropped an ice cube in as I would any glass. It cracked the bottom of the glass. The inner glass liner is so thin, as thin as a glass Christmas ornament. But I didn't know it was cracked because the outer layer kept the drink from leaking out onto my lap. I could have swallowed a piece of glass.If you purchase these glasses, do not drop ice cubes in as you would a NORMAL drinking glass."
4,Fine glass for espresso or after-dinner drink,"The glass stays cool, the drink hot. Has lovely lines as well. Feels nice in the hand."
2,Disappointed,They feel sort of cheap to me and I think they changed the materials from what they used to be. I don't recommend this product for how much they are.
1,Awful easy breakable glasses,"I would give this glasses less than 1 star but that's not possible. I paid over $20 for 2 8 oz glasses and both broke in the first 2 weeks. In both times no big drop happened. Just a knock/touch of the sink and one glass broke in my hands. The other one broke in a similar way. I don't know whether the glass quality fluctuates, but I've really thrown away 20 bucks in the garbage. Yes, I liked these glasses as long as they were alive, but I don't like gambling like that!"
5,Great for your morning espresso,I love how these glasses hold the perfect dose of espresso and how cool they stay to the touch. I was so impressed with them that I bought another set.
3,"Looks and works great, stars docked for fragility","Bought these a few months ago for espresso shots.The good - Look great, and work great, outside stays pretty cool, and drink stays warm. I've not had any problems with moisture getting between the layers, but I've been washing by hand only and generally treating with care.The bad - I accidentally tapped the side one of them on our counter top a couple of days ago, and it imploded. It really wasn't a hard blow, and a 'normal' glass wouldn't have had any problem...That said, I ordered a replacement, and will see how the remaining one holds up."
3,Love these!,"The only reason I gave these glasses 3 stars is because they are soooo delicate. The glass is so light that it almost feels plastic. Not for those who just throw their dishes in the sink because the slightest dink seems like it would shatter these glasses. Other than that, I have no issue. They are awesome!"
5,Beautiful and Durable,I have had a set of these glasses for almost three years now and I haven't broken one yet. (I can't say the same for my 13 oz. bodum canteen glasses.) These glasses look nice and insulate well. I always hand wash them (and all my other dishes). I also don't drop ice into them. I really think these are worth every penny.
2,Broken Promises,"While I enjoy these glasses there are some issues. First, the glasses do not hold 12 oz as advertised but only 9 oz. Second they are fragile. You should not buy these unless you very careful - and don't let children use them. They have come broken in shipment, even in their bubble wrapped and boxed sets. They have broken if ice cubes are dropped in them. They have broken if you use a spoon to stir in them. They should not touch anything metal in the dishwasher. They are stylish, very good to use if you are careful but hardly something you won't find yourself replacing if you aren't careful with them - much more than you would with a fine crystal glass of similar size. I do agree they are sturdier than the larger 15 oz Riki style Bodum stackable glasses which only hold 13 oz."
1,Too fragile!,"We were able to use these one week. At the end of the week I was hand-washing the cups after making coffee, and one glanced against the edge of the sink and shattered. I was not washing in a reckless or overly-vigorous manner. I was so disappointed - what a waste of money. :( The next week my husband picked up 2 MUCH sturdier glasses from Starbucks for half the price and no delivery wait. These Bodum glasses are elegant but not practical for daily use. :("
2,"Cool Idea, Bad Execution","I loved using these tumblers for the week they survived. Taking tea to my desk without burning my hand was a novelty. But both tumblers cracked after a little over a week of use. I told the company, and they said they would replace them, but I didn't bother when they told me that I shouldn't put the tumblers in the dishwasher. They also said to put ice in them after the beverage, rather than putting ice in first like I always do.Bodum advertises all of their double-wall glasses as being made from medical grade glass that is used in science labs, and claims it's stronger than traditional ""soda-lime"" glass. If the glass is so strong, why can't I clean it in the dishwasher or drop some ice cubes in it without it cracking in ten places?Might want to think twice about these tumblers unless you want to handle your drinkware with kid fingers."
2,"newer model is too fragile, leaks","This newer model (2009-2010) does not measure up to the prior models. I have an older set of these purchased at least 2 years ago, and they are still in tip-top shape. I then purchased two more sets this year and all are broken already. The newer model (which I assume is what is available online these days) seems to be made of thinner glass. Moreover, the seal on the bottom is covered with some sort of plastic button (the older model did not have this but rather, was solid glass). Prior to breakage, I had problems with moisture seeping in between the glass layers. The original product was sturdy and definitely kept hots hot and colds cold. The newer model does, too...while they are still in one piece. Shame on Bodum for cutting corners."
3,Disappointing New Version,"I had a pair of the old single sealed piece of glass design, which are probably the coolest looking bit of kitchenware I've ever owned. They're also quite functional; the outside stays cool even with espresso brewed directly into them. I broke one of the pair (own fault, fumbled it into the sink) and decided to order two more. The new ones are really disappointing; now instead of a single piece of sealed glass there is a hole in the bottom sealed with silicone (or some other similar translucent substance). Aside from looking tacky (and let's be honest; the main selling point is that they look cool), the new construction is less sound (the plug traps dirt, and feels like it might peel out), and less well insulated (I think the old ones were partially evacuated).I'd buy more of the old ones in a second, but these are mediocre."
2,Fragile and thin glass,"Yes, these glasses look cool with liquid in them...but that's about it. The ""double-wall"" of glass is really, really thin. I feel like it could break in my hand. And it's still surprisingly hot to handle when you've got anything hot in there. Overall, cool to look at, but pretty cheaply made. I honestly cannot recommend buying it."
5,They just work,"First, the most important thing: these just work. If you are used to a ceramic mug that has to be preheated, or turns your coffee cold, you will be stunned by the difference. Though they certainly lack the visceral comfort of a mug, being really light, your coffee will be hot, and stay hot. Period.The problem these always had is that they used to break rather easily. What they did in an attempt to solve this is put what is basically a valve in the outer wall to allow the air pressure inside the glass to equalize, which seems to have done the trick. They are listed as dishwasher safe, and though I have not had the guts to do that, I use mine daily, stirring vigorously with a metal spoon, etc., and so far no problems."
4,"Bodum Pavina 12-ounce Double-Wall Thermo cooler/beer glass,set of 2",Item ordered was as described and received this item quickly. I was very satisfied with sevice and product.
5,Amazing glasses!,"I purchased these glasses for my boss who had an imcomplete set. He was over-the-moon when he received them; so much that he asked me to order an additional set. These were more affordable at Amazon than anywhere else and I was pleased with how quickly I received them. A few reviews mentioned how fragile these are, but, like any fine glass, you should respect that they are hand-blown and treat them as such. The double wall system is fabulous for keeping hot things hot and cold things cold - simply amazing! Don't hesitate to buy these. My boss was so impressed, maybe I'll get a raise!"
4,Perfect cup for espresso lovers!,"I bought these as a gift, and I was so impressed with them that I decided to get a pair for myself to use with my Nespresso machine. These are super light, which does cause them to wobble slightly on my Nespresso machine when the coffee is being poured. These do keep coffee hot for way longer than my regular demi-tasses. Finally, it is quite pleasant to be able to see the actual espresso's deep color and rich foam from all angles. Highly recommended!"
5,Slight buyers remorse,"I purchased the 8.5 ounce size. But because of that air barrier, I wished I bought the 12ounze size. I find myself constantly refilling my glass. This would make a great water glass for a dinner party."
1,glass to thin,"These are too thin and break extreamly easily, and the one that is left does not keep ice from melting any better than a regular thick drinking glass. Not worth the money."
5,Ferrari of glassware,"I bought a pair of these for myself and spouse about a year ago because they are so beautiful. After a career as an artist/professor I enjoy using aesthetically pleasing objects day to day (I could never afford a Ferrari, but I admire them). I can afford these glasses and I must say they work very well! Liquid temps are maintained longer and they feel good to hold. I'm buying several more variations and a carafe soon. For those who can't bear to expend a little extra care in cleaning and caring for them, stick to your Chevys."
1,espresso glass,"While the concept sounds interesting, in reality, this ""thermo glass"" is completely frivolous. An espresso is served cool enough to drink right away so you don't need double walled glass to protect your fingers. These glasses don't keep the contents warm any longer than a standard espresso cup. They are more fragile than a porcelain cup, which works just as well and costs much less. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,12 0z.: beautiful but fatally flawed,"First, these are objects of beauty, in form and function, Those of you who appreciate fine objects will understand as soon as you see them and pick them up. The glass is smooth, light, and airy--and unfortunately very delicate. The narrow base combined with the light weight in this design leads to tipping over and breaking. Unsafe for any household, regrettably! Maybe the smaller sizes and/or wider base designs would work. A real pity, but this is one case where the designer did not work with the engineer ;-(I have reported these to the Consumer products safety commission."
5,A very nice solution,"Coffee (and other beverages, obviously) stay at their intended temperature much longer. The finish of the glass is not terribly refined, but then the price is appropriate for what is delivered, so all in all a very nice solution to keeping heat or cold where you want it."
4,Very contemporary!!,"The Bodum Pavina 2-Ounce Double-Wall Thermo Glasses (Espresso/Shot), Set of 2 are very attractive glassware. I can't believe they are dishwasher and microwave safe too. They work better for just espresso, not cappucino. I've ordered the 3 oz. ones for cappucino now too. I like the whole selection of this glassware and plan to order more in the future."
4,"Hot stays hot, cold stays cold","Does what it should, keeps hot shots hot and easy to handle and does it while looking very cool."
4,Classy but be careful,"The two-ounce glasses are perfect under the double head of my expresso machine. The positives to me are 1) double insulation keeps expresso hot while I am frothing up the milk and 2) they are a sexy and classic design. My only problem has been that when the expresso machine is vibrating as it dispenses expresso, the glasses tend to vibrate as well. They often move from directly under the dispenser. I have had to hold them in place for much of the 30-seconds it takes to produce the expresso. Also, due to their shape, with the base being rather small compared to the sides, a few have slipped out of my grasp resulting in a broken glass and expresso to clean up. I am ordering another pair as I broke my second glass in the past 12-months this morning. I'll try to be more careful."
4,Cool design & keep hot drinks hot!,"We've had these in the 2 oz., 9 oz., and 12 oz, sizes for a couple months and they are used daily. They are holding up very well and definitely keep hot drinks hot. I use them for cocoa, my husband for coffee and we both love them. Not certain if they are to go in the dishwasher but about half the time we put them there. I would have given them 5 stars if it were made in the US or UK, not China; I failed to notice that they are made in China and mistakenly assumed they were made in the UK since they've won so many awards there. The amazon price +free shipping is definitely the best deal I could find. Enjoy; you'll get tons of comments from guests on the 'cool factor'."
1,"dont buy, i want my money back!!!!!","glass broke after one use!! Had morning cup of coffee, left the glass in the sink came back after work and found it cracked! Its either the glasses are garbage or someone broke in and cracked the glass to piss me off."
2,Too Fragile,"When I received my order, a glass was already broken although it appeared that the products were securely wrapped. If they are that fragile, imagine what could/would happen if you bumped/dropped this. It would shatter. I was under the impression that they were a lot sturdier. They are not for me."
5,Wife's latte glass of choice,"These are great glasses. They also shatter impressively if you drop them in sink or on floor. Still, even clutz me was able to get the last one to last several years with care. They come very well packaged with adequate protection."
4,Double wall espresso shot glasses,"There is nothing really wrong with these glasses. They insulate the hot espresso very well so you don't burn your fingers. I don't use them any more though, because my espresso machine vibrates when producing the espresso. This causes them to 'walk' around on the platform, and the possibility of missing the glass opening is very high. Actually if you look close on one of the glasses, it was formed not level. When you sit it on a level counter, it looks like it is leaning over."
2,Way too fragile - waste of money,"We bought 8 of these glasses in January to use for cocktails. We liked them because they're lightweight, keep drinks cold, and are nice looking glasses. As of March, we have only 1 left. After breaking a couple glasses trying to put ice cubes into them, we started being much more careful with the ice cubes but inexplicably, the glasses continued to break. One broke in the dishwasher despite being completely surrounded by plastic kid cups. A couple we're not even sure what caused them to break. I would definitely not recommend this product."
1,dissapointed,"this must have been second choice, the inner ""glass"" was lopsided and not even. Should have chosen the 9oz glasses."
1,Overpriced & too fragile.,"I JUST got these glasses and one has already broken during washing. Not dropped, not stacked or pressured by other dishes, just bam, shattered while washing.They also have a big patent pending stamp on the bottom that's a bit obnoxious.I didn't expect them to be very durable, but this just seems absurd. I was originally going to order two more sets, but I'm so glad I waited.I'd rather invest in something with THICKER glass. 2 12 ounce glasses for $20 is just too much if they're going to break immediately. Disappointing."
1,"Loved the old ones, hate the new ones","I was very disappointed when I received the newly designed Bodum glasses. The ones that I had were great: Light, kept the espresso at the right temperature. Unfortunately, Bodum added a hole to the bottom of the glass covered by a silicone-like plug. Now the glasses don't seem to be dishwasher-safe anymore. They fog between the double walls. I wish they would have kept the old design."
5,"Love the Idea, the Style, the Look","These glasses are great. They're the most attractive ones I've ever used. This size (9 oz.) is great for coffee, and the show they reveal as the espresso machine is brewing each cup is interesting to say the least. The cups are sturdy, and they work perfectly as insulators against heat and table damage. I love that they don't need handles, so they're very sleek. I do have one problem in that the second set I ordered was about 1/4"" shorter than the first, but the volume is still the same, so no stars off for that. I would forgive them worse than that but don't have to."
5,My third order,"The only problem is that they are fragile. I busted my first one puting ice in it from the refrig. Once you learn that and accept the fact that you will bust one every now and then, they are perfect for chilled wine or hot drinks for my wife.I will replace them as broken and accept that as a cost of a great product"
4,Be CAREFUL- Very FRAGILE,"I LOVE these glasses however, they are very FRAGILE. In under one month I managed to break both of them."
3,disappointing,"i finally found these in the store and bought two boxes, i remembered how much i loved my moms. but, it's true, the design is totally different with an ugly plug on the bottom. mine hasn't come out yet, but i've only used them twice, did see some white stuff in the bottom of one of my cups with ice water (it wasn't from my water filter either as none of the other non bodum glasses had any white stuff). reading the other comment, makes me wonder if it was glass fragments. they are light, which is nice and they really do keep cold drinks cold longer than any other cup, but mine have all produced condensation (albeit less than on an average cup) contrary to advertising and i've still had to use coasters. and for $10 per glass, i really think they should absolutely live up to their advertising. i will be returning mine."
2,good but fragile,glasses are nice but break extremely easily. the slightest bump against the side of the glass will cause it to shatter
3,Kinda neat,"These glasses are interesting, but not really that great to use. They do not look very elegant and break more easily than other glasses. I am currently using some other glasses that have a metal wire handle on them. They are more sturdy, look nicer, and are easier to drink out of.****************** Update 11/26/2012One of them broke quite a while ago and the second one sat in the back on the top shelf until a week ago. My wife started using it again for espresso. I am keeping track of how many days it will take for her to break it. They are a fun cup if you do not use them every day and are extra careful with them, but at $10 a piece I will not be buying more."
4,Great product!,"I use these glasses for pouring espresso shots from a home espresso machine. They work extremely well and fit perfectly in the machine. They appear to hold up pretty well to washing, but they also seem to be a little fragile after holding hot liquid for a minute or so. I've broken 3 of these glasses so far after they've slipped from my hand while washing and fell into the sink. I'm a little more careful with these now when I wash them.4 stars for being a little too ""fragile"" for my liking, but working extremely well."
2,Beautiful and stylish but break easily,"I love these glasses and so do my guests... BUT can't spend any more money on them. We go through several a year, order more and enjoy them until they invariably break. We try to be gentle with them, hand wash them and try not to leave teaspoons in them but we end up with broken glasses too quickly. I'm on Amazon this time to order regular white porcelain cappuccino cups. Buy them if you don't mind replacing them several times a year."
1,Disappointed,"I bought our first ones in about 2007. We love the older ones. Suggested them to many friends, and bought some as gifts for friends.I bought a set just a few months ago, to replace broken ones. They do not have the same insulation capabilities as the others. After a few minutes the outside of the glass is cold, and the ice cubes don't seem to last as long. Are there any old ones left to be purchased? The news ones don't seem to sweat, so that is a plus."
2,Cheap newer version has a problem,"First of all, these Bodum shots are beautiful.And, they do the job.However, I have bought two sets of these, the older version was blown glass, period. Wonderful. The newer version - February 2010, is blown glass, but rather than a glass seal, there is a plastic/silicone/?? plug over the hole in the bottom. Over time and many washings, this came off. Now, there is water inside the double wall:(. Looks ugly. I don't understand this. It can't save all that much to just seal it right. I give five stars to the earlier version, but only two for this."
2,Never got a chance to use them,My set came poorly packaged; both glasses arrived completely shattered beyond recognition. Nobody bothered to insulate the packaging or inform the postal service that the box contained fragile glasses.
4,Not glass.,"These are very light and clearly plastic, however they seem to be a better type of plastic, looks like glass but isn't due to recent shattering of glass cups.. I'm definitely a fan of these since they will not break, however it does take away from the classiness of the actual cups being that they are not glass. I just purchased an automatic Espresso machine for my husband and as expensive as that was, these are pretty darn cheap! we love the look and style of them and they are perfect for Espressos, which my husband loves and haves every single day... twice on weekends! I highly recommend these for the Coffee or rather Espresso connoisseur!"
3,Fragile and made in China,"I like these glasses but they are very fragile. I knew that before buying them because I have several others. My order arrived broken. Amazon quickly sent out a replacement set.What I didn't know is that they are now made in China! I wish Amazon would list the country of origin. I won't be buying anymore of these. In addition to the poor workmanship of many Chinese goods, I don't trust the Chinese not to shortcut the production to save a few pennies. I can't tell if they are made out of borosilicate glass (Pyrex) or not. If they can save money using leaded glass they will do this."
1,False ordering status,When I placed an order for these glasses the purchasing option clearly stated that this product was in stock & I would receive in 2 days.Then I see a email confirmation stating that they are out of stock & a message saying the price has gone up!This was supposed to be a birthday present for my brother. I will just have to wait for them to come in stock because I am not going to cancel and pay $5 extra.Very disappointed!!
1,Glassware is JUNK,Bodum glassware products are JUNK --- bought 3 of the large coffee mugs and all three of them failed. They were what I wanted to keep my coffee hot but the bottoms broke out of all three. Do not buy -- there are better products on the market.
2,Looks great until it breaks,"They look great, they keep your drinks hot or cold. They'll break as soon as you set them down on the table, though. These lasted two weeks for me."
2,Nice while they lasted,"They are really nice cups.. while they last. I always washed them by hand, but water still managed to get inside."
1,Disappointing new version,"I loved the previous version of this glass, which was completely hermetically sealed. The new version has a small hole in the bottom, covered in a silicone(?)-like rubbery compound. On one of my two new glasses, this compound came off in the dishwasher, which means that water gets in between the two walls and is impossible to dry... sort of like double-paned windows where humidity gets in between the layers of glass. So it's ugly and foggy, rather than clear and pristine.Wish they had left well enough alone!"
1,"Nice looking, now in the garbage","Fragile. Broke it just washing it with my fingers. And I don't exactly have big, meat-hook hands. Normals hands, broken cup."
3,Great product that needs better quality control.,"One of my two glasses had water in the interior after I washed it. Afterthe second washing it had even more water in it. And no way is thatwater coming out. Despite this flaw, I'm probably going to take a chanceand order some more. I really like them for hot drinks."
1,Beware. Not safe. Glass slivers found while drinking.,"I was a fan of these Pavina style tumblers. Then summer came and I made ice water in each Pavina tumblers and served them to our guests. After one guest finished drinking the ice water, she noticed that there were glass fragments inside the cup. Yes, the ice water shattered the bottom of the glass. The cold water shattered the bottom. I was very careful to place the ice in each glass and proceed to pour water into them. Two of my Bodum Pavina were shattered at the bottom. Since there was ice in the glass and the glass being double layered, one can not tell if the glass has been shattered. I can't imagine what it would be like to have swallowed slivers of glass. I wrote a email letter to Bodum on their web site. Absolutely no response."
4,Almost perfect,"I absolutely love these glasses. I use them everyday for my hot tea. I love that the glass doesn't get too hot to carry. And they seem to keep my tea hotter longer than other cups/glasses. I would have given these 5 stars except for the fact that they are very fragile. I'm very careful with mine. I don't use a spoon in them. I wash them by hand and keep them seperate from the other dishes when drying. With that said, I did break one of them about a month after I got them (my own fault... I tipped one over and it fell into the sink). If you are careful with them they are fantastic. I plan on buying more. The 12 ounce size seems perfect for most uses... so I'll probably stick with that when I order more."
3,"Works well, cool product, fragile.","I love these glasses they are great a keeping things cold/hot while still being able to be held.The are definitely fragile though, we lost one on the first day when it tipped over on the table it was sitting on."
2,"Pretty, but Delicate","We started with about 6 of these glasses and now we're down to two in less than a year. They are really pretty and we get lots of compliments on them, but they break very, very easily! Even just putting them through the dishwasher has causes one to break. And when they shatter--oh boy! What a mess. They shatter everywhere. Into tiny, tiny pieces."
5,Love them!,"The double layer glass works really well! The outside of the glasses stays really cool, so they're perfect for espresso making."
2,1 out of 4,I really enjoyed the product the first day. After washing them 1 of 4 had water in the interior. It is impossible to get out. I am disappointed that one of my set was defective. Was not sure who to contact to get replacement. So I am unpleased. The 3 that I own are great.
5,Great glasses,These are great glasses in that they do not bleed and keep beverages cold or hot. I love placing coffee or a chilled drink in these. They are great quality and none have broken on me yet. It is also really neat to see your beverage in the glass. Overall - I highly recommend them.
1,Uneven cup and poor QA,"I ordered this Bodum Pavina 2.5-Ounce from Amazon after seeing in person and thought this would go great with my new Espresso machine. It arrived promptly from Amazon Prime.However, after washing it and having 2 glasses filled with espresso the next morning, I noticed that the coffee was tilted, and looked uneven. Upon inspection, one of the glasses was tilted and not flat at the top. Upon comparing, the base of the inner wall sits lower than the other!!Paying as much as you do for 2 glasses, you'd expect that the Quality coming from Bodum should be better... I have several Bodum glasses at home, and I'm EXTREMELY dissappointed at this. Makes me think twice before buying from them again.I have pix, and will post for others to see."
5,Perfect product,Perfect product. Performs exactly as intended. The cups are cool in design and stay cool (see what I did?) even with extremely hot beverages in them. Be careful to take a big sip forgetting how hot your espresso is!
3,"Look's good, Bit cheap","Product looks good on the table but once you hold it it's feel's cheap in your hands, Feel's much like plastic rather than glass and it's very light, it's also pricy for the given fact's, However as I said earlier it looks amazing with latte in it and you can hold the glass even if you have hot liquid in, Also the steam runs out thru the silicon on the bottom.OK product."
4,"Loved them, but already broke one.","I loved that these allowed me to pull basically 2 shots per (with a little extra room to avoid spillage). Unfortunately the glass is very fragile. I took my espresso machine on a trip, and plopped a 3rd shot glass into one of them. This cracked the inside of that glass and it eventually broke through.FYI: I have a Saeco Aroma and they fit nicely under the espresso spigot."
4,Bodum Pavina Espresso cups,"These cups are a surprise. The insulating technology works. My only concern for these cups is how they will last over time. Specifically the silicone seal on the bottom and the thickness of the glass. I have already scared myself bumping one of them around on the counter. This time the cup took it in stride, no problem. Next time I might not be so lucky.In short, they work well keeping your espresso hot. As far as the durability, only time will tell?"
5,Nice Little Cup,"Nice little cup. Keeps the product hot enough without burning your fingers. I need to get a little demitasse spoon, since my regular spoon is too big to stir in the sugar."
5,Beautiful and functional though perhaps not as durable as desired,"These glasses are beautiful and very functional, when there's a hot (or cold) drink inside, you can hold the cup without any sensation of the drink temperature. The insulating property also helps keep your drink hot (or cold) longer than a normal glass or mug. I use these for coffee. The downside is that the glass is very thin and the manufacturer recommends against putting them in the dishwasher as they may break."
3,do not last,"Those cups look nice and are well made.There is a serious issue though, the vacuum seal does not last resulting in poor insulation and water accumulating between the 2 glass layers.Looks like the silicon vacuum plug was not so well engineered ...."
4,Great product & great customer service.,The glasses are great. Amazon was great with replacing one also. I ordered 2 sets and one glass in one box was crushed. Replacement was swift and easy. Thanks.
5,"Bodum Pavina 2-Ounce Double-Wall Thermo Glasses (Espresso/Shot), Set of 2",These Expresso cups are the best! They allow the drink to stay hot (with out scalding your hand) and to see the beauty of a well built expresso.
5,Bodum Pavina 9 Ounce Double Wall Thermo Glasses,We love these glasses for white wine. They look great and keep the wine cooler. It was a very easy transaction and the glasses arrived when promised.
5,"great thermal glass, no coaster needed",These are great thermal glasses. They keep your drink cold (or hot) and you don't need a coaster.
1,Delicate glass,"You can read my other review of this product under the ""Pavina Ice Tea"" product description. Suffice it to say that these glasses are very delicate, not strong. They break quite easily."
1,BEWARE - Dangerously Weak,"The ice dropping from our refrigerator door dispenser has broken out the bottoms on two of our four glasses. Fortunately we discovered it before anyone had the chance to swallow the broken pieces but you can imagine the consequences, especially to a child. BODUM IS NOT QUALITY!"
3,Is an espresso shot glass necessary?,"It's slightly pricey since any shot glass would serve the same purpose but it is practical, attractive, and since we leave the pair out on our machine after cleaning it is sort of decorative."
2,Great but fragile,"The idea of these double-wall glasses is great. I live in Hawaii and drinking from regular glasses is always a mess. The condensation is unbelievable. And these glasses don't even leave a ring on the table. But, there is a great but. They are extremely fragile. In fact, the last order I received contained two broken glasses. And the replacement order was broken also when I received it. My suggestion is to look for the glasses in a store and carefully bring them home yourself. I have another and older set, and one of them broke just by placing an ice cube in the glass. So ice cubes have to be gently placed by hand (or tongs) in the bottom of the glass."
3,"Nice design visually, but too delicate for my hands.","The GOOD: I like the design of these for both visual and practical reasons. The design is attractive to the eye and it does create a thermal barrier between the liquid and your hands.The BAD: I only wish the design had called for slightly thicker-walled glass. I purchased a set of two 2oz. shot glasses to use for espresso and after one day I now have a set of one. While washing them in the sink one slipped from my fingers and fell about 2 inches onto the sink surface essentially shattering in half. Most every other glass item in my cupboards would have survived the short drop but these glasses are just way too delicate for my clumsy fingers. For this reason I only give 3 stars. With a just few thousandths of an inch added to the glass thickness, this product would get five."
3,Despite the product's claim - do not use in the dishwasher,"The idea of the Bodum glasses is great. However, after only two cycles through our dishwasher, the glasses had condensation trapped inside the walls. After a third trip through the dishwasher, one of the glasses now has a half teaspoon of water trapped inside. Beware!"
5,Glassware,These glasses are truly unique. Very good quality. We use them nearly every day. They do require additional care such as hand washing and dropping the ice in the glass carefully.Treat them with care and you will enjoy them for a long time.
1,not recommended,"There is a hole in both glasses - intentional or not - it is there, as others have mentioned. Small enough to let any liquid in, but not to let the liquid out easily. Try as hard as you might, liquid will get in and remain, either as a liquid, a stain, or a water mark. If you plan to use these with guests, you better hope your quests don't mind drinking out of filthy looking glasses.But, they do look OK when they first come out of the box."
2,Break Easily,"For the price, the glasses are not durable. Both of mine broke within 2 months of daily use. The glass on the inside is very thin and fragile. One shattered (inside wall) when I gently inserted a sponge to clean it. Mine came with no instructions on or inside the box. When I called Bodum, they sent me detailed instructions on how to use the glass - these are not included when you purchase. It's unforutnate because they do keep beverages hot or cold and do not leave marks on the surface of any furniture you place it on."
1,Not the same quality as before,"I have many Bodum double wall glasses and have always been very pleased with them until now. The latest order, which are made in China allow water between the 2 walls. Looks horrible. Sorry Bodum, but the quality control has disappeared. BEWARE!"
2,"Started off so good, then not so much","I was super duper excited to get these glasses. I had been eyeing them for so long to use in my Keurig mini brewer. When I received them they were so light and I loved the ""modern"" design. Right away the glasses were too light to use in my brewer so I was freaking out. Then I put a plate under the glass to use it. I figured ok dissapointed but no biggie. I was hand washing them. With a sponge. I used hot/ cold as it says you could. One day the glass just cracked on the bottom on it's own as the other reviewer had wrote. So I am super dissapointed. I also have cheap ikea glasses that have lasted years without any cracks so what's the point in paying more ?? I will try and contact the company to see if they'd replace... I hope so.. I actually bought the 8.5 oz or 9.oz one but I know these are all the same"
2,2 broke,Bought these as gifts and 2 broke when ice dropped in. Very delicate but they do work in keeping your drinks cold or hot.
2,Functions well but some quality problems,"Even though this product works great, the edge can break or crack easily. The edge is where the glass doubles back to create the space between the two walls. When you have any liquids in the cup, all that weight is being cantilevered from the outer wall to the inner wall, i.e. suspended. So, if you happen to bump or shake the cup while it is full, that puts a lot of stress on that edge. I've had 1 cup chip. I also bought the water jug but that one just broke when I bumped it against the sink after filling it. Yea, the worst possible scenario. So, if you are willing to pay for the great looks and functionality buy this but do expect that they won't last as other cups that cost less.The double wall really does insulate the contents, hot or cold. So, your contents last longer and your hand does not get hot or cold. Great for ice cream and tea. Their tea pot is also very good. I haven't broken that one......yet."
2,Too Fragile for my family,"Bought six of these over the holidays and already three of them are in the trash. They crack and lose their seal with minimal impact. Look lovely and are great concept, But not for everyday use in my family."
5,DESIGN REVIEW FOR BODUM 9oz,"We just picked up 4 of the 9oz Bodum mugs a couple weeks ago. Was a little concerned about the strength of the double-walled glass, but they seem good so far, though they are so light you almost throw them when picking them up at first.Great insulating quality...don't even need a coaster. They also seem to do better than traditional mugs as far as how long the liquid stays warm.Coming from the perspective of an industrial design student, the appeal of actually seeing the liquid though the glass in the rounded interior is very pleasing, especially with a frothy cappuccino. The balance of holding the cup is interesting since there is very little mass per volume-- the liquid sloshes around very well. Also cradles in the hand well with good grip to the glass.Nice product. I plan on eventually getting more of Bodum's double-walled vessels."
3,"Nice, but very fragile","The Bodum Pavina themo glasses are a nice design, but extremely fragile. I was able to use them for hot drinks such as tea, coffee, or hot chocolate -- as well as cold drinks. They looked nice and were amazingly not too hot to hold. However, the inner wall of the cup is made of very thin glass. The first one broke within a few days in the dishwasher simply from the placement spoke on the dishwasher! The second one fell a couple of days later and immediately smashed into a million little pieces. So, as much as I liked them, be prepared to handle with care."
2,3 of 8 broke in first year,3 of 8 of these glasses broke in first year of normal use.very dangerous glasses.
3,Very Fragile,"I bought a pair of the 2.5-ounce cups. They are well-designed, but extremely fragile. They are more slipperier than normal glasses. Given their small size, it is difficult to hold onto them well. A good product with a fatal flaw."
2,Get out the paper towel,This product is okay; however the seal at the base of the glasses leaks a small amount of moisure. The height of the glasses did work well with my espresso machine.
4,Be Aware - - Very fragile,"Mine arrived broken and Amazon, of course, is sending replacement. I've ordered many types of glasses from Amazon before and none arrived broken.- - UPDATE: Replacement set from Amazon came fine, nothing broken."
3,Nice; fragile,"These are very cool glasses, but very fragile. They insulate incredibly well. You can pour boiling water into them and the glass will be cool enough to hold. One of mine broker after just a few weeks because I stirred it with a metal spoon. If I had read the instructions I would have known that that is discouraged. I'll take more cair with the remaining glass, but I probably won't buy any replacements due to the fragility."
4,"cheap, nice espresso glasses","fairly sturdy unlike other reviewers comments - I am sure if you dropped them they would breaklook nice, great for a shot of espresso"
1,Fragile,"They are great like everyone says, we have had now four 8 months but, we have lost half the set due to everyday wear and tear. I contacted CS and no response. Great Glass for special occassions not everyday....Sorry"
4,Beautiful Espresso Glasses,"These are very attractive little glasses. They are light weight, and feel very elegant in the hand. The double-wall thermo glass keeps them comfortable to hold, the glass never gets hot.We use these in our store all the time (it's a high end boutique) and our clients are always complimenting us on them.The only bad thing is they can break very easily and they are made in China, which is a disappointment."
4,"Nice glasses, a little fragile feeling",The glasses were nice and very effective in keeping your hands cool while keeping your drink hot. They are very dainty feeling and therefore require some respect as to not break them. A nice purchase for a higher end drinking glass.
5,Buy these,Not only will you impress your friends and neighbors but these are very practical classes. Used for wine they keep your warm hands from disturbing the wine. They're also more rugged than expected and have lasted through some drops and spills. Too bad they're becoming so popular.
5,Wanted the turning handle sifter!,"I watched my grandmother, mother and other family members make biscuits. This older type sifter was impossible to find in my area and I wanted this type. I wanted the handle that turned. Love this!"
3,gift,"was a gift for my mom and she was ok with it. Doesn't use it much, but it is a small one that she can handle"
2,not thrilled,I'm not overly thrilled with this product. The little arm on the inside rubs so closely against the screen on the inside that its hard to turn the crank. My husband tried to adjust it a little bit to make it easier to turn but didn't have much luck
3,Basic and OK,"After I bought this I found one just like it at my grocery store for $6. I bought for $14 with shipping. Also, the ""guage"" or particle size that it allows through the strainer part is quite large. I am using it to sift freshly ground oat, wheat and flax and I'm finding that I have to do use this one on the first pass, then use a strainer and a whisk and do a second, finer pass in order to get the result I want. But its cheap and it works. Its also fast at doing what it does."
1,Flimsy - Works Poorly,"If you are a serious baker, this will not do. The construction of the body of the sifter is fine. The ""wire"" that turns inside does not function properly and the handle is so poorly constructed that it does not turn correctly when the sifter is empty and simply won't turn smoothly with anything in it. I would not recommend this sifter, even on sale."
1,Nothing But Disappointment!,"I was excited to purchase this sifter because my squeeze handled one was becoming difficult for my hands. So I put 2 cups of flour in and cranked. I made it through 1 and 1/2 revolutions before it became stuck! From then on I had to pull and struggle to get it to go completely around and in the mean time the flour was being thrust all over the place. I had a big mess on my hands, so I just gave up and went back to my squeeze one. Buyer beware...this is a piece of junk! Don't waste your money."
3,Multiple Rust-Like and Bent Areas On Screen,"I have a sifter similiar to this, but thought an all Stainless Steel would be better. I was preparing to wash the sifter in hot, sudsy water before first use when I noticed multiple rust-like discolorations on the sifting screen. I was very disappointed as I was up-grading to stainless steel because I thought it would be better than my tin one, but not so. The sifting screen was also bent out of shape in several places.I won't bother to return it (Amazon has great return policy) as it was just under $10 including shipping, and it is usable. I just don't know how long it will last with rust spots. I am very disappointed, though. I will pass it on to a new cook who can use it until they find something better. Made in China."
2,Cheaper at grocery store,I bought this and the very next day saw it for $3 less at my local grocery store. I couldn't be bothered to return it to Amazon but I wish I had because I used it once and cleaned it and there is already a rust stain on the inside.
4,A Classic,Purchased two as gifts for my sisters. This was exactly what I expected and just like the sifter mom has had for years. I recommend the crank sifters over any of the others out there. They've stood the test of time and do the job perfectly and easily.
3,"Stuff goes in, stuff comes out.","It's a sifter of the simplest design. Put flour in the top, crank the handle and it comes out the bottom. The action is not all that smooth but not a lot of effort was put in to the design."
5,What we wanted.,It was exactly the old fashioned model my mother wanted and she seems to be very happy with the purchase.
5,Crank = Hand Cramp Free!,"Nice sturdy construction. The crank is very easy to turn, although I would caution against cranking too vigorously as it can cause a flour storm... I like this over the the spring loaded handle versions because it doesn't require hands like The Hulk to operate. This was a great find!"
3,Its OK,"It is terribly difficult to find a 1 cup sifter these days. When I saw this I purchased but it is by no means my favorite. The handle is a pain, and it flings flour around, i still have it but the only reason I use it as I have been unable to find another one the size I want."
4,If its not broke...,This is like my mothers old one. Love it. Like the saying goes if its not broke dont fix it. I hate the squeeze handle ones and was happy to find this. Would buy again if they ever improved the metal straight so it cant bend.
5,Does a good job,I really love this and use it for all my baking. Please be aware tho that the mesh is not too fine so it does not work very well for baking powder etc for me. I love the crank style tho...really saves my fingers from getting sore and painful.
4,great sifter,This sifter works much faster and more effeciently than the squeeze handle type sifter. I think it is less effort also to turn the knob. Easier to clean also!
5,Quality,This sifter is sturdy and does a very nice job sifting. Grandson's like to help and it holding up their use.
2,Can't fit more than 1/2 cup,"I was surprised at how flimsy and cheaply this item is made. You can't sift more than about a half a cup of flour in this flour sifter because when you crank it, the wire inside clumsily flips the ingredients up and over the top. Also, fine powder comes out of the seam at the bottom.I gave it 2 stars because it at least sifts small bits at a time, but I would NOT recommend this product."
4,crank flour sifter,The Mrs. Anderson's 5 cup stainless-steal crank flour sifter is very well made and reasonably priced.
3,Ok until you can find a good one,"It's actually getting pretty hard to find a sifter in stores in my area, which is why I ordered this one. It gets the job done, but it's not very well made, and the handle is a little difficult to turn. It's definitely not something you're going to want to deal with long term, but if, like me, you can't find anything better locally, it will do for a while."
2,"Thin, tinny feel","This flour sifter is supposed to be made of stainless steel, but it feels more like thin tin. It also does not crank very smoothly. Sometimes it is difficult to get it to make a full revolution, and it leaves small balls of flour in the bottom. It just feels cheap. I regret this purchase and wish I had spent more on a higher quality product."
3,Sifter,I bought two . One for my daughter since we bake all the time. It is better than the old fashioned one. I would recommend it to anyone .
2,Disappointed,"This sifter is a total disappointment. I was hoping for a good quality product like the one my grandmother used for years, and instead it's a total piece of crap. The crank gets stuck at the bottom on every turn, which makes it impossible to use without making a huge mess."
2,Ok,I bought this a couple of weeks ago. I got it and the handle wasn't turning well so I sent it back and they sent me a new one. The one I have now turns a little better but it's definitely not the best sifter. I'm not sending it back again but I would recommend maybe spending a little more money for a better one.
4,flour shiffer,"IT work's great,My hands get stiff sometimes an it's hard to do some things,an I like to cook,this makes it a lot easyer"
4,Good for its purpose,"I've only used the sifter a couple times and it has performed sufficiently each time. It is a light weight item but not necessarily of low quality (though it certainly isn't top of the line either).The sifting mechanism definitely works better in one direction than the other. Clean-up is easy and simple - just a quick run under some hot water.The size, at 5 cups, is more than enough."
3,Average,"Crank was wobbly. Compared to newer sifters on the market, this is really an older model. Given the amount of grinding that the wire caused on the inside, I didn't feel the sifter would hold so it was returned."
1,Poor Quality Sifter,I purchased two of these as gifts. Recently at my daughters I had opportunity to use it and was quite disappointed. It cannot handle 3 Cups much less 5 cups.
2,Crank Poorly made,"I was very disappointed in the construction of the crank. It is not securely mounted in the opposite hole and comes out easily. Wire hangs up in sifter.Again, things today are not made with the same solid construction as in years gone by! Sorry."
2,Not very efficient.,"I was disappointed with my new flour sifter because of the crank mechanism. Turning the crank isn't a smooth, fluid, motion, like I was hoping for. It has only two wires and one popped out of place while I was sifting. Although it can hold 5 cups of flour at once, you can't sift that much at once because the crank mechanism isn't strong enough. It can reasonably sift maybe 2 cups of flour at once without popping the rotating wires out of place. My advice is to order a larger sifter than you think you will need.I used a friend's sifter recently that great - strong, sturdy, and efficient with a solid body and multiple, turning wires which made the sifting process quick and easy. I thought this might be that sifter, but it's not. Sadly, I will be ordering another flour sifter that can works better and can meet my needs."
1,Don't Buy This Sifter,"I love to bake, so I use a sifter frequently. Mine is the same size as this but is 40 years old, a hand-me-down and works perfectly. This was to be a present for a friend who was having trouble finding a crank handled sifter. While the body is solid, the mechanics of this sifter are AWFUL. The crank is flimsy and not strong enough to rotate the interior wires without bending. Also the motion is not smooth, with nothing in it, the sifter sticks. Just a bad product."
2,"Cheap, cheap","While searching everywhere for the type of nice sifter my mom has, I thought - ""I've found it!"" with Mrs. Anderson's crank flour sifter. Well - yes, it has a crank, and it certainly sifts faster than the one-hander squeeze handle version I had. But - whatever you're sifting leaks out the crank handle hole, and it's just so thin and flimsy, I'm wondering whether it's going to last through the holiday baking season. If you do a lot of sifting, I would not recommend this product. I'll just have to keep looking...."
4,Great for sifting espresso grinds,"I got this sifter to sift espresso grinds into a portafilter basket to improve their distribution, and it works great for that. But it is pretty cheap and I suspect it won't last more than a year or two. In case anyone is interested, the 1 cup model has an ID of 3 1/16""."
3,5 Cup Stainless-Steel Sifter,Very nice sifter. The handle and crank are a little flimsy. Flour is able to shoot out the sides as you crank.
3,Flour Sifter,This sifter is kind of hard to use. When turning handle flour tends to fly out of sifter even if there isn't a lot in it. Flour is sifted well just a little messy.
4,Adequate,"Sifter seems to sift unevenly, side to side. Perhaps I can manipulate wire or screen to remedy this but shouldn't have to. Single screen and wire are very simple and easy to clean."
3,3-cup sifter,"It does the job, Nothing fancy. Would have gotten 5 stars if it had a squeezer on the handle, not just the crank."
5,Great item,"For sifting flower, this item is much easier to use then one we used to have which involved squeezing the handle. Since it is so much simpler in mechanism, it is easier to clean too."
5,Mrs. Anderson Stainless Steel Crank Flour Sifter,The stainless steel crank flour sifter Mrs. Anderson offers on the Market is good quality! I'm glad I chose it over the tin models they offer.
4,love the larger size,"i havent used it yet, but i love the larger size.. now i can sift and not spill over.. you cant beat the hand crank.. ive used smaller and squeese handled ones but now that im older , i see the old way is better."
1,"cheap, didn't work","Very disappointed, especially for the price. Crank wouldn't turn with even just 2 cups of flour in it. Cheap, flimsy. I am returning it."
4,Works as promised,"There is not much to a flour sifter, this one does everything it is supposed to. If you are doing any baking with white or AP flour it's a necessity. It is not too heavy and cranks easy. For me the 3 cup size was perfect, but I am normally only cooking for 2 people. I have had the sifter for about 6 months now and it still looks new, no rust problems... but then again I only use it for flour. How much damage can flour do??"
2,Ok but not Great,"I did purchase this sifter based on reviews, but I was a little disapointed. Yes it is stanless steel, however it is not as heavy as i had hoped it is very thin. Also the 2 wire agitator does not fit well and does pop loose. I guess if you do not use a sifter much it is ok for the price a bit high to be so thin, however if you use a sifter a lot, I would not purchase this one."
2,Mesh Screen Not Fine Enough,"I have another sifter that works with the squeeze handle. I like how that one sifts flour, but it is hard on the hands. I purchased this one because it has the wind up handle--which I love, but now the mesh screen is not as fine as the other sifter which causes the texture of my scratch cakes to be a bit courser. I think this sifter would be perfect if the mesh screen was a bit more finer. I wonder if I could purchase a fine mesh screen to insert into this one instead of throwing it out or having to find another replacement."
5,Easy to use.,"Before I ordered this product I had a flour sifter with a squeeze handle. It works fine for flour, but is almost impossible to use for powdered sugar, which I do have to sift for a certain frosting recipe that I make. I had a hard time finding an old fashioned sifter with a crank handle. I noticed this one on Amazon for a good price. It arrived quickly and was very easy to use. It's exactly what I was looking for."
1,Stupid design!!!!,"DO NOT buy this sifter. I gave this item 1 star because the system won't let you leave w/o any stars, other wise I would have GIVEN THIS ITEM zero STARS> I can NOT believe that someone thought that it would be smart to leave open holds on each side of the sifter(from the rotating/crank nub), the flour gets out through the holes, I hate it!!!!. Plus the crank nub is so low that you can only put in 2 cups at the time(even though it is a 5 cup sifter). But, I guess you get what you pay for...... I should have gotten a different:("
3,works great but too small,"Replaced my ""fancy"" handle-pull type sifter with this one. Although it works fine, I wish I'd ordered the larger capacity version."
1,Damaged and no paperwork,"Extremely disappointed. This item arrived damaged like it had been used for football practice. It is bent in three places, making it not work properly. This is the third damaged item I have received this week. There was no paperwork included with this item and I am sick of having to hassle with shipping things back that come useless and damaged. I am really irritated."
1,Piece of crap,"I purchased this item in Oct. 2009. I don't bake very often because I'm sick of cooking. I ran a home bakery for 20 years and was a home ec. teacher, now retired. I took this sifter out to bake a cake and found that the handle part does not turn freely. I had to shake the darn thing to get the flour out. Then I find that it's much too late to return the thing, (I'd never used it before) so I'm out $10.00 which is tough when you're on SS. Disgusted in Ocala!!!"
3,review,It works ok. Not great; you can't put 3 cups of product in it and crank handle without product coming out the top.
5,Will not rust,My last sifter the wire basket started to rust. This time I bought a stainless steel one so I will not have that problem again.
2,Flimsy handle,This really only works when shaking ( which can be messy). The handle is very flimsy and hard to use.
1,Baker,Junk junk cheap from china or a good reason for. I mean real flimsy. A coat hanger would be stronger by far junk- junk
2,This is not it.,"It looks like my old sifter,but it's not. The hole on the sidewhere it turns is to large,flour pushes out on counter whileyou sift.NOT GOOD.How do you not know the hold is to large.Itwas not expensive so i won't return. But disappointing."
5,"Good shredder for CD's, etc","Seems to me that all shredders below $1k (that is, shredders marketed for home use) are noisy and messy and tend to overheat if used for long periods. This one is better than the two others I have owned. Still, running it near its maximum shredding capacity for more than a few minutes will cause it to overheat whereupon it takes a seat on the bench for 20 or so minutes, then comes back to the fray ready to do battle again. And it's still impossible to empty the bin without making a mess on the floor, so it lives in the garage where it's easy to sweep up. This particular model does a much better job shredding CD's than any other shredder I've owned and the safety shut off if little (or big) fingers get too close is important to me. Amazon is certainly the place to buy one of these.... very good price and prompt delivery."
2,Unable to get replacement parts,"Great shredder UNTIL IT BROKE! I called customer service and they diagnosed the problem over the phone. Sold me a replacement gear set that will ""fix the problem"". (My unit was 2 months outside of the warranty period.) When I took the unit apart to install the new gears I discovered the gears that were broken were not included in the replacement set. When I called back, I was told that the two gears that were broken in my unit were not available for purchase (since they never break, duh). And to make it worse, since I had already installed the gears they sent me, I could not return them. So now I am out another [..]."
1,It is not the item pictured.,I wanted the Spiral Lift Ankle Support as shown by Amazon. Instead they sent me the new Comfort Lift. I wanted the one with the seam because the seam can go over the weak ankle and give more support as specified by my podiatrist.
1,"love the show, hate the butchered recording","I got this from a company that doesn't have the original masters, but copy them with permission from the record companies. What I got looks good and would probably sound good IF there weren't horrible pops every few minutes. Oh, well. Lesson learned. (BTW, the African American cast of Hello, Dolly with Pearl Bailey is wonderful. But look for an original albeit out-of-print edition.)"
5,Ritchie is still the Best,"Another magic by the great magician of rock music,Ritchie Blackmore. He is not only talented in Rock music but also now he made one of the charmful album for new age music and especially Medival Music. We all know Deep Purple and Rainbow as the best bands of the history of hard rock. Now come and listen another masterpiece of the Perfect stranger and Gypsy of rock Rithcie Blackmore and Candice Night."
5,Hiroshima of The Frogs,"This book is another in a series of books written about the subject of frog deformities. This book sheds an urgency on the problem in a dramatically written narrative, that hopefully will inform and concern most readers. While many people make light of the fact that the world has a frog problem, no one can dispute that global changes are affecting these animals at an increasing rate. Even if the problem is a ""natural"" one as some reviewers suggest, people should still be concerned that the world is rapidly loosing animals that have managed to survive for millions of years- certainly we should be doing something to change this; whatever the cause. I applaud the author for trying to get readers to see the problem as a global one, and a serious one. I would urge people to read this book, and come away from it prepared to do battle with the naysayers that have little concern for the future of frogs, the planet, and human life."
4,Good source of information-shocking yet true,"As a student currently doing research on this topic, this book was a good reference to the issue to frog deformites, expecially in the midwest where this book revolves around (the N. Leopard Frog)."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"I purchased this product because they were advertised as being 74 min CDR. Now maybe it's my old burner that has trouble with the 80 min CDRs or maybe they are just a mass produced lower quality product. Either way, I didn't get what I needed and thought I was getting due to the fact that what I actually ordered was 74 min CDR, (like it said at amazon) not 80 min CDR!"
1,Might be good for classroom setting with 3rd graders,"Oh, how I hate to be the one to criticize a fellow professor! But, even as a literature/philosopher professor myself, I would have trouble implementing the ideas in the the book. I also question using the particular works/poems she chose to explain the philosophical concepts. I have no doubt that she does a terrific job in the classroom, but I'm less sure about how easily that expertise can be translated in a book like this. Although she says that the approach is good for a wide range of ages, I doubt much of the literature she selects would be accessible for kindergartners-- the vocabulary is just too sophisticated. This book just did not live up to my expectations...."
2,More what to teach -- less how to teach,"I bought this book to learn more about what my 8-year-old grandson was capable of learning about philosophy. What I found was something typical of so many works on teaching/learning -- much concern about ""how to teach/learn,"" and little concern about ""what to teach/learn."" I'm sure others will find more merit than I did; frankly, I was disappointed ."
3,Not really for parents,This book is appropriate for someone who works at a preschool or day care with small groups of children. It's not really helpful for parents who are looking to develop thinking skills with their children.
5,cute red hat,This red angora skull cap is very cute. It looks just like it was photographed. Price was unbeatable. Good purchase.
4,Nice slippers,"I bought this for my mom, and she loves them. Vey good cushion, they do keep your feet warm, but I don't agree you can use this kind of slippers outdoors, the sole is very thin, so just keep them inside your home."
4,This CD is great,"We did this play for school. It has wonderful music. I garuntee if you l ike broadway, you will loooove this!!!"
4,Great musical still heard at its best here.,"One of Broadway's most beautiful scores, Brigadoon is still heard at its best on the 1947 Original Cast Recording. And while some shows recorded at this time are poorly treated, this isn't one of them. As well, the digital remastering has brought the beauties of David Brooks and Marion Bell to the fore, and the Lerner and Loewe score though badly truncated remains a testament to that collaboration's romantic genius. Forget the subsequent recordings. Though they are more complete, the spirit of this show is best preserved on the Original. How many songs have been written that start to near the evocation of ""The Heather On The Hill"" or the immortal ""Almost Like Being In Love""?"
3,SKIP THIS ORIGINAL CAST ALBUM,"The sound is quite terrible on this original cast album. The score is dreadfully truncated and none of the performances reaches above workmanlike. However (and it is a big ""however"") the score by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe is one of the glories of the American musical theatre.My advice to anyone who wants to investigate this musical is to buy the EMI recording featuring Brent Barrett and Rebecca Luker.John McGlinn conducts. The sound is perfect, some of the more important dialogue is performed, the performances are top notch, esp. Barrett as ""Tommy"" and a tenor named John Mark Ainsley who sings ""Go Home With Bonnie Jean"" and ""Come To Me, Bend To Me"" better than I've ever heard them sung. And, best of all, the entire score, complete with exciting ballet music (originally choreographed by Agnes DeMille)is here on this one CD. Skip the original cast album."
4,Nice piece.,"Though it is metal, the tone is warm. I get some squeaks on some high notes which requires some adjustment to avoid. Warms up quickly."
4,rock and roll,04-07-2004just received from follow that dream the entire concertwith the full ontro 2001 space oddessy and 8 other songs that werd omitted from the final prouduct.the concert was great and i hope a lot more peoplewho are elvis fans get this.this also released as a quadraphonic L.P. and alsoA QUAD- 8 TRACK.
1,An Unbiblical View,"I saw this book in the store and the title got my attention, as I am always looking for more material on women in the Bible. However, as I sat down to read through it, I realized that the author -- and we don't know if it's a male or female -- writes with a punishing view. In the story of Jepthah's Daughter, for instance, the daughter is portrayed as quietly accepting her fate, and she is upheld for that decision. In the story of the Concubine in Judges, the re-telling is written in such a way as to suggest that if she had listened to her mother and not complained about her husband, she would not have been raped, murdered and dis-membered.This is a dangerous book for anyone with a serious bent to study the Bible; it is especially dangerous to our daughters.PLEASE! Do not buy this book."
1,Is that what happened???,"I have started reading my study bible everyday and decided that this book might be nice to read as I learn about each women of the bible. I was shocked at how ""made-up"" the stories were. I felt confused having to go back and read the bible again to see if that was what happened. For example, I read in the bible that Dinah was raped, but then in this book he makes it out like she wasn't and really glamorized the encounter she had. I don't want to read a bunch of nonsense when I am trying to really understand the bible. I would not recommend this book, esecially if you are just setting out to read and understand the bible, this book will make the stories mixed up in your head, making it difficult to discern fact from fiction."
5,women had a big role through the ages,"I seen it in a cancer clinic; women had a big role through the ages and this book did a great job of covering all, good and bad.Paul"
5,Awesome !,"Very pleased with the condition, price, and purchasing process of the book.It was a gift for a friend, she was so surprised when I gave it to her.Thanks, Amazon for my great shopping experience!"
4,Good Teaching Tool,"This book was purchased for my Mother when her adult Sunday School class asked each of it members to prepare a class on any topic they wished as long as it was related to the Bible. Mom thought this book would be great as a reference for a class about the women of the Bible, especially since so often the women are forgotten and not discussed as much. She thought the book lived up to being a good reference and learned alot of new information about many of the women that are found in the Bible. She thinks that it would best be used as a reference tool, rather than as a good read."
5,About the Denver Post Opera Company Edition,"The Denver Post Opera Company's edition is the complete script in manuscript format bound in rigid cardstock.Prepared for a 1955 performance.Lists of company personnel, extensive prop list and costume plot. 184 pp."
4,good product but weak support,"It is a well designed product packed with features. I have successfully upgraded the firmware to allow me to expanod to 3 gig of memory. To me it is an excellent selling point.I had read about its ability to play video clips and movies and was interested in trying them. I could not find the informatin I needed in the documentation and so decided to write their tech support team. Someone wrote me back and suggested that I read the manual. Well, there's practically nothing about this in the manual. So, I have this excellent product but don't have all the necessary information to take full advantage of it. Why can't the company post an addendum to their manual on the website with detailed information for the end user. At least they could mention the types of files that are compatible with this device. It would be apprecaited by many of their customers. It is always easier to keep the old customers than to compete for new ones.James LeeValle de Angeles,Honduras"
2,Pablos Comment. a Tired Alejandro,"Comparing this DVD with the previous one of he is not the Same thing in truth gives pain of as they could call this a finished product. If it is had to compare with the rest of the productions of Alexander Sanz it is a true backward movement with bad image that not even seems quality DVD and audio nothing special.By the way, Amazon is not bothered in mentioning that one of both discs that east package includes is the DVD and the other a live disc of 10 songs extragoings of the concert live. The sound of the band is not as good as what normally there is customary Alejadnro to us.What has happened to him to Alexander with these bad productions?I give rating him of 2 stars because the performance of the band is spectacular although the rest of the product leaves much to be desired. It is not worth the trouble to buy it unless you are very fanatico of Alexander."
1,Crap,"Don't waste your $$$ ! Perhaps the worst ""movie"" I've ever seen. This would make Ed Wood do flips in his grave!"
3,Average,It was kind of an average movie. Every body thought the survivor was nutz. The paranormal expert thought she was dangerous. Though I suppose it might scare most people.
1,NO POWER SUPPLY,"The description is misleading. It clearly says in the description: ""12V DC Power Supply.""Now I have to decide if it's worth finding the power adapters or not."
5,Hardball for Women,"I first read this book in 1993. I was one of 3 team leads on a large project and we were just getting started. This is straight, no nonsense talk. Within 3 months, the other 2 team leads read it as well as the project lead, the project manager, our division administrative assistant and our pruchasing agent. Only 1 of these persons was a male. He got just as much out of it as the women.My extremely well-worn copy gets perused at least once a year. This is a must read for both genders."
5,Telling it Like It Really Is,"Pat Heim's book is the only management techniques book for women that acknowledges men's rules, without ""selling out"" to them. As she points out, knowing how the boys play doesn't mean that the same behavior will be perceived or received the same way from women - a key distinction ignored by all other books I've read on this topic.Her follow-up book, Smashing the Glass Ceiling, provides a situation-by-situation manual for applying her insights (if you can find it - ask amazon or contact her at the email address she provides above.) Both books offer specific advice in a well-written, articulate presentation. I highly recommend them.You may also be interested to know she has a great videotape series (expensive, but well worth the corporate dime, according to the feedback in my organization) and she is a terrific trainer (I've met her and was impressed.)"
2,Seems mired in stereotypes and out of date social issues.,"I was very disappointed with Hardball for Women, as it had been highly recommended. As a 35 year old female who has held management positions for the past 6 years in a large, male dominated company, there was little I could relate to. The frequent references to the way women operate did not reflect how I or female managers around me operate. How we supposedly were raised and socialized did also not strike a chord. Perhaps the book is for an older generation that faced more of these issues, or perhaps I've been lucky or worked with enlightened women. Either way, I would not recommend it."
5,Even my picky eaters (3 and 5 y/o) loved it,"I've been having an extremely hard time feeding my 3 and 5 year olds. It seems no matter what I put in front of them, they turn their noses up.Although, I didn't notice any difference from any other pasta out there, because of the vibrant colors my kids gobbled this up. The ingredients look all natural and it tasted great.I will be buying this again."
3,Set it free!,"Well, what can I say? If you already know Cage, you know what to expect. If you don't, be prepared! It is unlike anything you may have heard before: not traditional classical music, rather musical thoughts, floating through the mental space... and not necessarily in any logical order... very experimental. It is soothing, in a way... but I guess only if you also like free jazz and other experimental forms of music.So, if you don't know Cage, and if you want to discover unusual forms of composition, go for it! Besides some [...] to spend, you've got nothing to be afraid of! Who knows... you may get the hang of it, even!"
2,DID THE JOB WITH A LOT OF EFFORT,THIS IS A NICE TOOL BUT IT SHOULD HAVE A 5LB HAMMER INSTEAD OF A 3LB HAMMER.IT TOOK A LOT OF HAMMERING TO REMOVE THE REAR AXLE BEARINGS.THE T HANDLE IS ALREADY LOOSE SO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS TOOL WILL LAST EVEN IF YOU NEEDED TO USE IT ONCE A WEEK.
3,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for a step-by-step detailed description of how to fold the dollar, instead I had to pass this book to my brother who is an expert in folding the buck to use this book. But even he found some of the directions difficult to understand. There also weren't that many ideas suggested in this book. There are more ideas for folding the buck online than offered in this book."
3,early 70s south,"This is a somewhat interesting read --- early 70s south as experienced by an ivy league hippy, who volunteered one summer to work on a black-collective peanut and watermelon farm. (I decided to read it because I recently met the author.)"
3,Difficult to read,The story moves a bit slow but the major objection I have to the book is the small print. It makes it extremely difficult to read and had I known it was printed with this size font I would never have ordered it.
1,BORING,This is one of the most boring books I've started....I have tried to keep at it hoping it would get better but it is one of the few that I just can't waste any more time on.Why would anyone use such small print? You need a magnifying glass to read it!Pass on this one!
5,"Beautiful, Moving Book","I've ready dozens of Holocaust books (fictionalized & non-fiction accounts). This is one of my top two favorites. It was very beautifully written & moving. If you like this one, I also recommend Reena's Promise."
5,Love this cotton-bamboo towels,"These cotton/bamboo towels have become my favorite thing to splurge on. Super soft, super thick and soak up water like crazy. The bath sheets are HUGE and comfy to wrap up in. Have gotten a few with minor loose threads but that happens to all towels with time and most of the bath sheets have been in perfect condition on arrival."
3,Perspective,"Both the reviews below fail to clarify a few things. Post war Japan was a horrible place. Planet of Japs is a comment on American soldiers' treatment to Japanese civillians. It was brutal, so is the comic. (Not pointing fingers at any country here. Japanese soldiers' treatment to Mongolians was not exactly fair either). It is disturbing. History is written by winners. This is a victim's perspective.This book does a fine job of showcasing Japanese underground, and everything else that goes with the territory."
5,A handy device,"Multiple back surgeries have given me a few additional challenges, one of which is putting on shoes more easily. I have acquired several shoe horns of various types but this is my favorite and hangs in my closet where I use it most. It is well made and easy to use. The spoon's attachment to the shaft is by means of a flexible coil spring that works at more comfortable angles. Highly recommended."
4,Shoe horn works great for persons with back trouble.,"This item came in a slightly damaged package, but works just fine for people who have trouble bending over to put on tight shoes. Would recommend as gift for an elderly person."
2,Banana Rama,"The costume is a fun idea, but not worth the money. It's pretty poor quality. I wouldn't recommend it unless it's 20 dollars or less."
4,Great costume,My son loved this costume for Halloween. What a great change over the latest superhero with muscles. He got great reactions from people too. We had to stuff the bottom and top with tissue paper but it worked well.
5,Excellent book to clarify fundamental financial concepts,"As a former student of Dr. Parks, I say this book has demystified more basic financial and economic theories than anything I've read before. Master this book and you'll never be intimidated by Wall Street Journal's C section ever again."
4,Good for the price,"I buy things mainly on price and then cross my fingers and hope they'll hold up. I bought these tubes for my recumbent bike that I ride a lot. The feel of the tube did not give me confidence, but now I've ridden many, many miles on it and it's help up great."
5,Elvis Blue Christmas - wonderful!,I'm very happy with the product I received. My problem was my own... I ordered several CDs and had already put some in my cart. I didn't look at it so ended up with two of several CDs. But it gave me additional gifts! Worked out alright!
2,There's better available elsewhere.,"While all of the performances contained here are worth having in your collection, RCA's song selection is downright Scrooge-like (the CD has a total running time of less than 20 minutes) and the sound quality has been bettered by more recent collections. Those who want a definitive Elvis Christmas compilation should check out IF EVERY DAY WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS, which contains each and every Yuletide recording Presley made on a single disc."
2,Blue Christmas Review,"The music is great, what there is of it. What you don't know until you buy the CD is that the producers only packages 8 Elvis Christmas songs for a total of slightly over 20 minutes. If you don't mind feeling ripped off by RCA, then Elvis sings Christmas beautifully."
4,What's here is very good!,"This is a low-budget Christmas compilation. The first 4 songs are from his 1971 ""The Wonderful World of Christmas"" album and the last 4 are from his classic 1957 Christmas album. This CD has some really good songs on it, but it only has 8 songs. I would recommend that you spend a few extra bucks and buy the outstanding ""If Everyday Was Like Christmas"" CD which contains every Christmas song that Elvis recorded!"
4,Pretty good!,"This is the first book Victoria Holt book that i read and i found it rather amusing. Even though at start the story moves at a very slow pace, it turns out to be extremely interesting near the end!"
5,Don't be Fooled by the Cover!,"The cover looks like a ""bodice-ripper"", but it most certainly is not! Victoria Holt was much more respectful and had dignity.Annalice and her brother Philip are orphans from a long line of mapmakers. They find a hidden room in their house, and in there, a haunting diary from their ancestor and a map to an island with gold beyond their wildest dreams. Philip sets off to find the island, but he never returns. Annalice goes off after him and her life changes forever!This is one of my favorites! I especially like the Victoria Holt novels where there are secrets uncovered (like a secret room and diary) and travelling to exotic places. This covers both!"
4,A bit disappointing,"The first part of the novel was tremendously exciting, with the discovery of the secret room and the diary, but kind of went downhill from there....I found certain details in the ending a bit implausible, and couldn't suspend that much belief. To post details of the plot would be a spoiler, so I won't do it, but this wasn't as good, at least for me, as Ms. Holt's other novels. Highly recommend ""The Pride of the Peacock"" instead"
3,It was alright,"It was an okay book, but i wouldn't recommend it. The plot wasn't very interesting. I probably wouldn't read it again"
2,Yuck!,"Yuck! this is the worst Saddle Club I 've ever read.There is only one way to describe it, painful.I saved it for my holiday and shouldn't have bothered.Were are the M.T.O 's? Were are Merill and Marie?Maybe they should bring in something about the ghost horse anything !!!!!!! Alia"
2,Not enough!,"The promising title is covered by only nine authors, which in my opinion, is not enough to cover the whole spectrum of the ""Craft"". The worse surprise; however, is that most of the texts are pertinent to very specific examples of very specific works of very different types of translations. I expected a full meal with this book and all I got was a tossed salad with very few ingredients. May I suggest another book by the same press? It is called ""Theories of Translation"""
5,Teasing brush is better than teasing comb,"I had purchased a teasing comb a few months back in an attempt to give my fine, flat hair some volume. Unfortunately, the combs fell short. They would tease, but when I would attempt to smooth my ""bump"" down, my hair would go right back to the way it was. After searching amazon for other items, I came across this and decided to give it a shot. I was definitely impressed. Not only did it tease much better than a teasing comb, but this teasing brush part also allowed me to smooth out my hair without losing any volume. I still prefer to use the pick of the teasing comb to separate my hair as I feel that part does a better job, but the brush part does wonders."
1,cheap,"Sorry, I didn't expect premium quality at the price but this brush is really cheap quality, some of the outer bristles are bent back, not worth ordering. Go to Sally and get better quality for the same price range."
1,damaged goods,A quick last-minute check of this brush before packaging would have revealed a large portion of the black glossy finish chipped from the surface. Makes me think it was used and passed off and sold as new.
5,Spornette does it again!,"This brush, like other brushes I have from spornettes is AMAZING!The brush is about as long as your forearm and as wide as an inch! You could use it just to brush your hair, and if you do you will notice more hair than usual coming out at first- this is because the bristles are so dense you comb more hair at one time.As for teasing this brush is ace! It teases my hair in no time at all, just three strokes backwards on each handful of strands and voila a rats nest!...It also smooths hair out as well so you can hide how ratted it is underneath!This brush is available from many locations at many varying prices but i found amazons to be the medium amount with the sweet bonus of free shipping! gotta love amazon!"
3,This brush is ok,"This brush is alright, but for teasing, I would highly recommend a comb with uneven bristles. I found it did the job much better."
4,Helped us find good snorkeling sites and good hikes,We went to St. John on our babymoon. We used the book to find good hikes and snorkeling spots. The book said Waterlemon Cay was the best and the book was right!
2,"Good for history, not for touring snorkeling spots",I think this book has value but not particularly for the use that I was looking for. I was looking for detailed directions/descriptions of hikes beaches and snorkeling spots and those descriptions are very brief and not very valuable. It is a good book for history if you are interested in that aspect of the island. I saw another review criticize the map in the book but what is kind of interesting about the map is that it outlines all of the reefs in pink which we used a bit in our snorkeling adventures.
1,Avoid this book,"This is a very superficial treatment of the island. The poor quality of the photos makes the book worthless even as a souvenir. You'll get better info at the National Park Headquarters. Wait til you get to St. John and then buy books or maps that suit your needs (hiking, snorkeling, history, flora/fauna, etc.)."
5,Training Day? I think not.,"Now you gotta remember, I love this guy's work, all the way back to Crimson Tide, to Glory, to yes, Trianing Day. There have been duds (uh...Pelham 1-2-3, Travolta stole it).Before this one, Philadelphia had been his best effort. But this role, this, despite its obscurity, was his finest. John Cresey is a torchered tormented soul. Those scenes in the room where he's trying to catch the bullet, that, is acting. You BELIEVED he was John Cresey. And as a tease, Chris Walken gives another perfectly understated performance (""You think God'll forgive us for what we've done? No.""). Magic.If you have not seen it, do.It will remain in my collection, and I will watch it over and over, as an omige...to craft.Tedd P.Denver"
4,Almost Perfect,"The size of this table is perfect for my T.V room; small yet functional and it really does make a statement. The added feature of folding out to a larger table makes it the perfect piece for any room. The color and the detail are lovely and it was fairly simple to assemble. The only downside; it does scratch rather easily. If you have a permanent display for the table such as a flower arrangement or a decorative bowl, I suggest putting felt on the bottom of it. I also recommend using a small tray, with felt on the back, of course, for your drinks, remotes, and things of that sort. Other than that I could not have designed it better myself."
4,Pencil in the Air,"Pencil in the air, Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing. I have had a copy of this book for nearly 50 years and I just bought several copies to give away as gifts. Most of the poetry is pure nonsense, a little of it is political satire, a few poems are sacreligious and a few deeply theologically profound. All in all this book is pure fun and I would not part with my copy."
5,works great,"This works great and is my favorite kind of super glue. The brush works well and it does not get clogged up, so it can be used several times and doesn't dry up."
3,Scholarly polemic on social science methodology,"Gregor, a longtime political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley, wrote this to accompany his then-required course for political science undergraduate majors -- and to help graduate students in political science who lack background in the epistemology and empirical methodology of political science to catch up to speed.Gregor is a logical positivist, and even as he wrote the book logical positivism had long been on the wane among professional philosophers. Nonetheless, this text is a helpful introduction to the subject for those interested -- after all, logical positivism has had a tremendous impact on the development of the social sciences over the past century, merited or not.Though intended as an introduction, Gregor's prose is dense and demanding -- you have to concentrate. But his argumentation is formidable and laced with caustic wit."

But his argumentation is formidable and spiced with sarcastic wit."
4,Not my favorite,"However, there are so many of the 87th precinct books, I wasn't worried about not enjoying this one as much. I suppose it was the ending bummed me out. It was like...huh? I was kinda let down. It was good though and Ed McBain's references to THE BIRDS and other works of his (that some readers may not be aware that he wrote) cracked me up. The book does age itself with many popular references but that's ok. Sometimes, due to the fact that the series takes place over such a LONG SPAN of time, it's kinda nice to catch up.I enjoyed the infusion of Ollie Weeks...though I thoroughly dislike that man! I did enjoy the way he was allowed to solve the case involving Marie--though I would have rather had my guys from the 87th do it! (smile)All in all I enjoyed the book as much as Romance--another book that was just 'okay'.I did enjoy Carella speaking the Italian, however. Nice touch."
3,Okay for a potboiler,"McBain/Hunter knows how to keep you turning the page. But for a writer who pays so much attention to detail, he warps time in ways that stop me in my tracks. A Caddy limo with a thousand miles on it needs a new engine -- and has one fully installed and ready to run in three or four hours of work? By the next day? In what world? Little things, like a guy lights a cigarette, says two or three lines of dialogue, then needs to light a second one? At 2:50 in the morning, the cops learn about a gun that was ditched in a sewer, then forty minutes or less later they've retrieved it and Ballistics has confirmed that it was the gun used in a murder? Little stuff, I know, and McBain is trying to keep the pace up -- but it interferes with the flow."
1,The violence overwhelms the story...,"McBain pushes a bit too far into the darkness behind sexual assault in this disappointing addition to the 87th precinct series. A group of college boys out for a wild night that ends up in page after page of depravity, something that is there to shock, but does very little to move the book forward. It starts to become violence for its own sake and if McBain was looking to desensitize the reader he succeeded. Violence is necessary in these books, they depend on authenticity to create this world effectively, but here McBain just seems to get carried away by it and the story suffers. For me, probably one of the most disappointing books in the series and I'm pretty sure the only time I've ever given one star to a series that I've enjoyed."
1,Nocturne,"The characters never developed. There was a lot of drama, but I couldn't get into it. He talked about characters that you had no background on and knew nothing about. I continued reading hoping it would get better, but it never did."
3,Third time not a charm,The first two are awesome. Somehow this one lags behind. Similar styles as the first two without some of the vocal strength. The combination of Afro and Celtic is great to spin too if you teach or like these combos. Good to stay on top of this group with the album. Can't wait to see what they have next time around.
2,"HORRIBLE, NO, WORSE THAN HORRIBLE","There is no point to this disc. The songs have no substance. I am still waiting for the song to get to the end. Every song leaves you waiting for more; for the place of satisfaction. The singing is unbelievably bad. Soaring voice place over the music, totally ruining it. The voice is grating. The lyrics are inane. The beats are so common they are embarrassing. If some of these songs had no singer, they might be good. The ten minute song, which ends strong, is ruined with the singing that is so off key, I can't deal with it. There are two songs with good rhythms, but maybe those moments of clarity is why I gave this two stars. This should have no stars, because there is nothing to this. I can't communicate this strongly enough. If you know anything about music, you are going to hate this. It leaves you wanting for more, and never delivers it. Waste of time and money."
3,This isn't a slide!!!,"People are saying *the slide is only 6 inches long* this is not the slide. It is a little track for games. They sell Race Tracks seperatly. I do think this track is a waste of money, it's 6 bucks for a plastic stick. O well it's something to do with your beanz."
3,Really Fun!,"I think that this toy is very fun, even though it took me a long time to be able to do something that's in the instructions. I made up some of my own games with it and it really paid off. I really liked this toy, and I think you would too."
1,The best way to use mighty beanz,"Well, I had hoped we could do more with Mighty Beanz, to be honest. I will spend the money for things that my boys will use often and have fun with. But...we bought a couple sets of Mighty Beanz, and two of these tracks. I think we spent about $75 total (2 tracks and 12 beanz) and all the kids do is toss the beans around and play catch. We can't figure out the big deal is. yes they are cute rolling down the track, but after 3 minutes they put it down. And my boys are very creative, they can make a fun game out of just about anything. If we had only spent $10 then whatever, but I wish we had gotten something else instead. To watch beanz just flip over down a short track...the fun wears off quick. the commercials had made it look much more fun. maybe we are missing something...but I have to say this is one of the few toy purchases I have made that was a total waste of money."
2,A good place to hide beanz from little sister!,"I'm not so sure about this thing actually doing tricks and whatnot, but as a parent trying to keep little things out of the toddlers mouth, I love this toy because it closes up on both ends so that the beanz can't get out and baby girl can't get to them! Of course she could if she knew how, but for now, she just enjoys shaking the thing and hearing them rattle inside. Works for me! Now, if we could just figure out how to actually use it for its purpose and do some cool tricks, that would be even better!"
4,Good quality for the money,This is your basic bowling ball bag. It does the job and seems to be of good quality.
4,A classic children's fantasy set in Edwardian London,"E. Nesbit completed her best known trilogy of fantasy books with The story of the Amulet. It returns us to the lives of the brothers and sisters we met in Five Children and It and The Phoenix and the Carpet. But the tone is darker and the freedom from adult observation is due to lonelyness rather than holiday freedoms, as was the case in the earlier novels. The children's parents are in danger of their life, and they find themselves faced with the chance to help when they meet the iracible Psammiad again. It leads them to a time travelling amulet, which might have the power to grant them their hearts desire.Much of the charm of this book comes from the realism of the children's characters. No matter that they dress in the plus fours and petticoats of the Edwardian age, their bickering and wonder in the face of magical events makes them timeless.A marvelous book, and a farewell to a familier group of children hovering on the verge of adulthood."
2,Only lasted 17 months,"Disappointed that the cover rotted into strips after about a year and half of Ohio weather. Bought from Amazon for $13.99 in late Oct 2006 and the cover was rotted through after this winter. It did fit a stack of 6 chairs perfectly and no problem with mold or mildew. Chairs stacked and stored outside on protected south side of house under eaves for winter months. Maybe heat of sun did it in. Surprised me since I thought the light tan canvas-like material would last better than the (what seemed to be cheaper) rubbery black covers I bought at the same time from Amazon for both our over-sized grill and the captain-style swivel chairs for our outdoor dining set that I couldn't fit in our storage shed. At the time I was disappointed I couldn't get the tan canvas covers for everything, now I'm obviously glad I don't have to replace those items ... they are still going strong and they are stored for cold months in the same south-facing location."
3,chair cover,"This stack chair cover is for the plastic stacking chairs, not for the high back folding, stacking chairs. It did not fit over the 6 stacked chairs that came with the table set. The cover was not big enough to fit around the chairs when stacked. Hopefully it will keep some of the rain off the chairs in winter, but know that this cover is for the cheap stacking chairs. not the metal chairs that stack."
4,Very pleased...,"This cover fits nicely and the material appears durable and long-lasting. I've been pleased with this cover from Hearth & Garden. My chairs have been kept clean and the cover has withstood the elements, even on the windiest days. I hope to use this cover for many years to come."
5,EXCELLENT,"We purchased two of these covers for wooden rockers we had recently purchased. The covers fit perfectly on our chairs. Nice, durable material! I would not hesitate to buy this brand of covers...Excellent value!!"
3,Hearth & Garden Chair Cover - good,PROS: Good material for weather proofing - vented so doesn't puff up like a balloon when windy - chairs all fit.CONS: none yetJust got this this past fall 2010 so they've only been through one winter - it was a Michigan winter and they did weather it well.
5,"Strong, sturdy","This cover fits perfectly over a stack of four chairs. It is well made, strong and sturdy. In addition, it cleans easily with a hose. Best if used on a stack of chairs to keep the hem off the deck."
3,"Good book, bit too long though","I really liked this book. However, I found that at times he was a bit too long winded. A lot of the paragraphs could have been much shorter, and I feel like he would have gotten his point across a lot faster. Otherwise, I'd actually recommend it."
4,Southern Symphony,"Phase 3 of Bruce's ""Southern Trilogy"" worked then, and it works very well today. ""Across the River"" is an epic southern soft rock classic that showcases Hornsby's emphatic playing, songwriting, and Virginian sensibilities. Band support is strong. The other songs are also quite goodGive it a try. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,Bruce putting it all together,"I was surprised to see the relative negativity of other reviews -- this is my favorite Bruce Hornsby album. Thought-provoking lyrics (as always) buttressed by some really interesting and enjoyable music. ""Stander on the Mountain"" conjures up all sorts of interesting images, and ""Barren Ground"" and ""Lost Soul"" are just flat out lovely. There's a lot to like here, and I'd recommend it to anyone."
1,worst Hornsby cd,"This is without a doubt the worst cd of Hornsby's career. He tries to rock out here but it just doesn't work. Except for the single ""Across the River"" the whole effort falls flat. You can't go wrong with any other Hornsby cd, just stay clear of this one."
2,Hornsby night on the town,"I didn't seem to care to much for this CD, it seemed like he didn't have his heart and soul into it. I have always enjoyed a few of his other CD's such as, The way it is, and Scenes from the Southside."
4,Werewolves is an awesome game!,"I first played this game during my study abroad progam in the Netherlands, so I was very excited to obtain it for myself. It came in perfect condition, and after teaching it to some of my friends at school, they're very excited to get a big group of people together to play it. It's best when you have a larger group, makes it more mysterious and longer-lasting."
5,Fun game!,"In the village of Miller's Hollow werewolves come out at night to devour villagers. Players take on the roles of a witch, Cupid, hunter, the little girl, and villagers to help lynch the werewolves. A simple role-playing game which allows you to see the true character of your friends as they defend themselves and accuse others of being a werewolf. Test your lie-detection skills and see if you're good at reading people."
5,The Ultimate Party Game,"For any gathering of 8-18 people, this game is a must have. A role-playing game, Werewolves is a game of deception and trust where everyone must decide who is lying and who's telling the truth. Everyone looks as thought they are townspeople but some people (through radomly passed out cards) are secretly werewolves that are trying to kill all the townspeople. Every nighttime the werewolves kill and every daytime the town must decide on someone to kill, hoping that person is a werewolf. With many different variations to the normal townsperson (hunter, fortune teller, cupido, little girl, witch, and theif) which all have unique special abilities, the game never gets old. For those of you who remember Mafia, this game is very similar but more well balanced and polished. I hope you have as much fun with it as I have!"
5,Makes everything a party!,This game turns every group gathering into such a fun party. Adults as well as the younger kids all enjoy it!!!
1,Poor components and poorer rules!,"The cards are poor quality, the artwork is horrendous, and the game booklet is a tiny little thing. The rules as stated don't make for a balanced game, either!"
2,wish the card is more durable,"the card is too thin, we only used once, and some of them already got wrinkled and torn, the design on each side of the card is not very intuitive, wish they have print name on it."
3,material left over,"These are beautiful and lather up well however the user is left with what feels like thread/netting, and what do you do with it, and it is not easy to determine where the thread/netting begins and the soap ends. So if it were just me I would use them but if you are thinking about putting this out for a diverse group of guests, I have chosen not to chance it. Worst case scenario the netting gets stuck in the sink drain and then what problems ensue from there?"
3,Decent Game,"Basically the song is playing and different colored icons are coming towards you. As they cross a certain point you press the colored button on the guitar that matches the icon and press the button on the center of the guitar which plays the note.... this is the entire game. Characters were a bit cartoonish, could have a larger variety of concert locations. I also would have made the guitars a bit more decorative in the game, they look really plain.Really good soundtrack, lots of great music! Guitar comes with some stickers to decorate it with."
5,Freakin Five Stars,If they could just find out how to do every instrument in a band - that would be a air drummers dream...
4,My daughter loves it.,"I bought this for my daughter for X-mas and although it is a wired guitar, she still loves it...She seems to enjoy it and goes to her friends with it to play with them.The only complaint she had was that it was missing one song she loved.Other than that she drives me up the wall almost daily with it."
5,awesome,"I bought this game for my almost 13yr. old daughter. She has been having a blast, so has her dad. They have been having head to head competitions that end with a high five. It is nice to have a game they can play together without trying to punch each other or kill each other. I guess what I am trying to say is ""THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!"""
4,one of the best games i've played,"My fingers are smokin! i play almost every day, so does my sister and her friends. we think the songs are awesome and my mom and dad sing along with them!"
5,Guitar Hero II,"I bought this game for my boyfriend, and now his friend bought an extra guitar so they can jam together! It's awesome!"
5,Rock on.....,"This is a great game, first time i played it was right before new years. And i was hooked, i never got around to getting the game on account me working so much. But nevertheless, this game is beyond belief they should have more songs but oh well. I recommend it to anyone."
4,rock a little harder if they make GH3,"this game is awsome if you are a headbanger,punker,or a plain old rock junkie like me but the only problem with the game is that the songs arent as good as GH1 so if you want to by a gituar hero game I recomend GH1!"
5,Great Game!!!!!!!!!,"This game rocks,the sg guitar works perfectly.Good choice of songs. A must have for anybody who likes rock.Some of the songs are kinda wierd but the other songs are great.All in all it's a great game."
5,AWESOME GUITAR HERO,This is the coolest game. Keeps the whole neighborhood busy right in front of you. The children have so much fun pretending with this game.HIGHLY RECOMMEND
2,Frequently freezes,"Great game but it froze up a lot in ""tour"" mode. Had to return it. Amazon handled return nicely & refunded all charges."
1,Fun until it broke,The strum bar broke after a couple hours of use. Exchanged for a new guitar. We'll see how long the new one lasts.
1,Disappointing song list,"I LOVED Guitar Hero 1. I bought a PS2 just so I could play Guitar Hero, so I was really anticipating the release of GH2. On the positive side, the game play itself is much improved. I like the fact that the songs are broken down into sections so you can see how many notes you got right and where the problems are. BUT. The song list is too obscure. The whole POINT of GH is that you can play the songs you've loved and known. I only knew about 8 of the songs on the whole list. The songs I don't know are pretty hard core and I'm not very motivated to learn them. VERY disappointed. Next time please - less metal, more favourites PLEASE!"
3,Fun In The Beginning...,"I bought GH2 a while ago, and I have to admit it was pretty fun, and addicting. But after you play it for so long it gets extremely annoying. The songs get old fast and honestly, I don't think it's worth the money. Just go find a friend that has one and play on theirs, because after a few weeks of playing possibly non-stop, you will find it in your closet along with all your ""boring"" things."
5,Very Addictive Game!!,"I just played this game for the first time over the holiday, and all I can say is WOW. I have seen this in the stores but never got the chance to play it... I also thought it looked stupid. Let me tell you, once you pick up the guitar and successfully play your first song, your not going to want to put this one down. This game is so good, I went out and got a PS2 just for this game. Multiplayer is a blast with this one. One person plays the guitar track and the other plays the bass (some songs can have a lead and rhythm guitar)"
4,Excellent game for Metal fans.,"I have really enjoyed this game because it breaks away from the traditional console game by providing a new way to interact with the system using the guitar. If you enjoyed any of the Dance Dance Revolution games, you will probably enjoy this game as well.The main down side in my opinion is that many of the songs are so darn long!My wife complains that many of the songs are also obnoxious and repetitive, and I agree for the most part.If you love Heavy Metal, though, you probably would have less of an issue with this. (I had never even heard most of the songs in the game; I'm not a Metal fan at all)"
5,Rocking the Entire House!,"Ok my 50 year old husband is now rocking and seranading me with a plastic guitar! We are having a great time with our family gift and it has been rated by my family as one of the TOP gifts for the entire year! :) if you don't have any musical instrument experience (like us) this is a BLAST! I am sure you ""seasoned musicians"" out there may find this great fun as well. This item is a MUST HAVE if you are a playstation owner! We got the Red Octane Dance Mat last year and this is just as much fun!"
3,"Fun, but you won't learn how to play guitar","My nephew was having a great time playing this and really loves it. Unfortunately it does not teach you at all anything about playing guitar, so there is no musical educational value to it. You do develop finger coordination from using the buttons which are like frets, which may be helpful to a player. So as long as you know that going in, you should have fun."
5,Guitar Hero is great for kids,Guitar Hero is fun for kids and adults together. It teaches coordination and dexterity.
4,"Great Sequel - Song List Lacks, Though","This is a great sequel to Guitar Hero I, although the song list lacks a bit, IMHO. One of the great new features is the ability to have a player play bass or rhythm guitar while another plays lead (simultaneously). You can also play against each other in a ""face-off"". There are some great old tunes on here (like KISS's ""Strutter"", Kansas' ""Carry On Wayward Son"", and Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"", to name a few), but for some reason it lacks some of the originality of the first game. Still, it is worth purchasing -- it is SO much fun to play. And if playing with another person, you really do get the feeling of actually ""jamming"" together. It's a blast! Highly recommended!"
3,"Great Fun, but.......","This game is really fun. Everything about GH2 is an improvement from the first one, everything except the songs. Yeah there are some good ones, but overall the music from the first one was better."
5,Quite possibly the best game on ps2,"Guitar Hero 2 provides hours and hours of fun, expecially if played with your friends. This game is a blast from the first time you pick it up all the way through beating the game on expert. The new co-op mode and pro face off mode are great editions, and alowying players of different skill levels play at the same time is well implemented. all in all i would say this is a must have for any ps2 owner."
4,a solid purchase,"A very fun game, however I thought the first GH had a better song selection. If you are thinking about buying the bundle get GH one for $10 more"
3,"less metal, more classic rock","loved guitar hero 1, and # 2 makes vast improvements in the practice and cooperative modes, but the songlist . . they have 7-8 great songs, and the rest everybody I talk to just skips over them. Now, it they were smart they would come out with a classic rock version, a blues version, and a metal version"
4,Beautifully moving!,"The title track, Amazing Grace, is an absolutely wonderful rendition of the classic. I listen to it at least 3 times a week and it gives me the chills every time! A real thrill!"
3,Not just pipes,"I purchased this CD looking for bagpipe tracks to listen to. The recording of Amazing Grace is flawless, and inspiring. However - much of this CD is the entire band playing more modern music (of course this album was recorded in the 70's). The pipe playing is excellent, but this is not really a bagpipe CD."
1,"Trumpets and trombones and tubas, oh my!!!","If you've seen any of my reviews for bagpipe cd's, you'll know what I'm complaining about. Amazing Grace played on the Great Highland Bagpipe is a beautiful and haunting thing. When brass comes crashing in, it ruins it. The same with Scotland the Brave. I use this one to pick up the tune when I'm learning something new on the pipes (and it's the only cd I own that has that tune). If you want a pipe band cd, steer clear of this. If you like the full band sound with mediocre recording quality, then this is for you."
4,"A bit heavy on the band side of ""Pipes & Drums & Band""","I bought this CD hoping to get the definitive recording of mass pipes and band playing Amazing Grace. I was not totally disappointed, but I already had a version that I think I like better which is on a CD entitled ""The Music of Scotland: The Scottish National Pipe & Drum Corps and Military Band"". The sound quality is better and the transition from the first stanza of solo piper to massed pipes in the second stanza is smoother in terms of the introduction of the drones. The arrangement is basically the same except that it doesn't have the extra flourish at the end of the third stanza before returning to the solo piper. The ""National Pipe and Drum"" CD also has more emphasis on pipes & drums and less on military band than does the ""Dragoon Guards"" CD. Unfortunately I cannot find the former CD listed on Amazon. There is, however, nothing more stirring than ""Amazing Grace"" played with massed pipes--no matter which one you get."
5,Bagpipes and More!,"I've had a vinyl copy of this album since 1972 shortly after its first release (1971) and it is pretty well worn out. I've been scouring merchants at Highland Game gatherings for years looking for a CD version when I finally found it on Amazon. I see some don't feel it is the greatest, and maybe it's not from a strictly technical standpoint. However, it was never meant to be a purely Bagpipe offering. It is the final massed efforts of Pipes, Drums and Brass from the Royal Scots Greys and as a historical item is just superb! Limiting it to just the Pipes would not have provided the full recognition of all the musicians of this fine regiment. Of all the more ""technically"" accurate Bagpipe renditions and other Scots music I have (mostly vinyl as many still can't be found on CD), this album gets still gets played the most."
5,Finally Found It!!,"I have been searching for a CD of this recording for ages! In 1971, when it was originally released, I was 10 years old and couldn't appreciate the album that my brother played endlessly. As I got older I started to miss it. I found a cassette copy several years ago, but am afraid to use it anymore for fear of it breaking. My brother told me he had found a copy of the CD at his local Borders, and since I don't have one in my neighborhood I checked good old Amazon!! I have just ordered and I am looking forward to receiving it. I'm not a music critic, but after hearing many pipe and drum recordings, this has got to be the best I've ever heard."
1,Product left my hair extremely dry,"I purchased this product hoping it would help with my tight curls, unfortunately it left my hair extremely dry. I tried using the mist to help, but that did not last long. Considering the amount of money I spent on this product I am extremely disappointed with the result. I can't stay it will not work for you, but it definitely did not work for me. My hair is short and kinky so if you have similar hair texture I would not recommend, but do your research and decide for yourself."
3,humidity control gel,"This product is OK but not as good as its sister product, Botanical Boost. It somewhat control frizz but no better than other products intended for that use for less money. I will buy the Botanical Boost again, but likely will not buy this."
1,this is a joke of a product,I ordered this product thinking it was a good thing. When I received it and tried it I found it was oily and yucky feeling on my hair. The company then sent me another package even though I said I did not want it and charged me $29.90. I returned package to sender and because they did not receive in appropriate time frame charged my account another $19.95. I called and told them I mailed it back 3 plus weeks before and gave them the tracking numbers to which they then credited my account $39.90. When I called once again to ask where the remaining $9.95 was they said I was charged that amount for a restocking fee even though their advertisement clearing states FREE returns. This company is a JOKE and hopefully anyone considering ordering from them takes note. Otherwise you will feel as screwed as I do..... HAVE A GREAT DAY!
2,Leaves Hair Extremely Dry,"I was very excited to receive this product. I actually purchased mine off of hsn. While the product definitely puts curl in your hair, my hair was left extremely dry and stiff. I used the product twice just to give it a fair shot and each time, the hair was left dry. I also used her leave-in. I used the leave-in once and also used the gel without the leave, just to see if there would be a difference. Also my hair is very thick african american hiar. Overall, I am very disappointed with this product."
2,Not for me,"After reading the reviews with many people raving over this, I decided to give it a try. I have had many problems trying to tame my coarse, thick, frizzy hair. (It's like Julia Roberts hair when she first appeared on the scene) My solution has always been to flat iron it. I really wanted to love this product. At first I thought it would work, but when my hair dried, it had less frizzies but it doubled in size. It turned into that 80s hair. I tried this a total of three times and the same thing happened. I decided to toss it. I wish it ended there. The first time flat ironing my hair after using the product my hair looked like straw. I had no idea what that stuff did to my hair. My hair has been extremely dry and even more frizzy since. It may work for people with thinner, softer hair but for me it didn't work. It made my hair worse."
1,Save your money. Buy mousse!,"Just got the TV products the other day. I washed my hair as directed. Dried my hair as directed. Followed the instructions for the Botanical Boost and Climate Control and was NOT impressed with the outcome.I was expecting to have my curls more defined and less frizzy, but they weren't. My hair looked the same as if I didn't put anything in it at all, with the exception of it feeling like it needed to be washed again.I've had more definition from a $4 can of mousse. When I got up the next morning, my hair was a wreck. There is NO way I could just spray some Botanical Boost and look good. Maybe this works at a salon with a stylist, but it's not practical for at-home use.In my opinion, it's just another niche-marketing sales gimmick. Save your money, buy the mousse!"
1,My $2.00 hair gel works better!,I was so excited to see this product on t.v. because I can't find something that'll not make my curls hard. Well this product definitely doesn't make your curls hard because it doesn't even work! After I applied the gel and the spray it was as if I hadn't even put anything in my hair and it was so frizzy. I thought my hair might be too curly so I tried in on my little sister in law that has wavy hair and it didn't do anything for her either. I don't understand how anyone likes this product because it does nothing to your hair! Biggest waste of money! Stick with store gel!
1,Pure HYPE - Does Not Deliver,"Got this as a free deluxe sample at Sephora. Was underwhelmed. Did not manage my hair, or do anything to make it less frizzy. In fact, it made my hair dry and lifeless. I still have three unused large samples ... I wil give them away or toss.Also, I put a well thought out, but critical review on Quidad's website. They did not print it. If you go to their website, ALL the reviews are positive. Not credible at all. Just leaves a bad taste."
3,Average gel,I was expecting better results from this product. My hair was still a bit frizzy and the curls didn't look that great. I think that I can get better results with over the counter products.
1,Just Another Sales Pitch,"This product, along with the Botanical Boost, did absolutely nothing for my curly hair. Looks exactly the same as it always did even after using it several times. Just a gimmick!"
1,Made more Frizz,Well.. this product made my hair have even more frizz.. it didnt hold a curl.. HMMMM not for me
3,not for me,"i have pretty curly hair and like to wear it curly, so i'm always on the prowl for the perfect curl product. i'd heard about ouidad for a while and ordered the gel and spray from the infomercial (and just canceled the automatic enrollment later). for those of us with curly hair, we know there are all different kinds of curls and well, this just didn't suit my type. it didn't make it crunchy, which i liked, but it just made it WAY too curly. like shirly temple curly. and i'm 25 yrs old; that's not exactly the look i'm going for. after applying the product, i ended up taking a flat iron to my curls to soften them out a bit. it's not all THAT bad and i'll continue to use it since well, i purchased it, but i much rather prefer products like Aquage curl cream, which is the best product i've found for my curly hair to date (they have this on Amazon as well if you'd like to check it out)."
1,Horrible Service,"I recently purchased a Ouidad package. When it came in the mail, the conditioner had spilled out all over everything. I emailed the customer service staff and they responded it was the fault of UPS. Okay, well that could be the case IF the package was dented in any way. It was not, so I told them the conditioner must have left their facility with a loose top. They denied it, and were rude. Needless to say, I did not get to try the products yet, but regardless, I won't be ordering from them again. A customer should at the very least, leave satisfied, if not happy. I was neither."
3,Good but,"Do not order this if you plan on using it with your iTrip. Maybe this is obvious to some, but the iTrip will not connect in the USB thing at the bottom because it is blocked by the case. Now I'll have to order something else.."
4,pretty cool product,"pros:it's pretty cool, it protects your ipod, and lets you get the ipod right out, and it swivels, and has a really easy to put on/get off belt clip.it's also really cool cause you can really quickly and easily pull your ipod off the belt clip, by pushing a release button, and slide it right back on, so it's really handy if you need to take a look at something or go through the menus.cons:however, the swivel thing is slmost annoying; my ipod is always shifting around, and makes it kind of bulky when attaching to your belt. also, just today, the swivel attachment finally unscrewed completely, making my ipod crash to the floor!but luckily, it was in the hard case, so it was protected. it still worked after it fell, so that's good.also, i know the descriptions says ""silver,"" but the picture made it look like a very light silver, almost white. that looked awesome to me. but i got it, and it's a much darker silver, almost grey. why isn't it white?? that would so much better."
1,does not work,has bugs that prevent the s/w from functioning. Program stuck at the beginning of the program. Don't waste your time and money.
5,My First Evis LP in 1975,"My first EP album in 1975 and still one of my favorites. Noteworthy, there is a small message on my LP album sleeve from Elvis, thanking the fans for their loyalty. Before this album, I had only purchased the two nationally advertised double albums ""ELVIS"" and ""ELVIS IN HOLLYWOOD"" from television. After this I started to build my collection of EP albums eventually forming a band ""Ocean/Sky"" and immitating Elvis. Now I'm in the financial industry. But, I still enjoy listening to this album, now on my I-POD.Thanks for the music, EP.Rene, in Miami."
5,Elvis at his personal worst and musically at his best,"I love this CD. Elvis's pain drips through the speakers as you listen to it. You cant help but feel the pain and heartache this man was going through. Every song ooozes with depression, regret, heartache and sorrow.I personally feel that the best rock star is the emotionally messed up one. With that being said the CD is not without its faults. ""The last farewell"" is the weakest tune on the album and should have been scrapped. I wish he would have done a studio version of ""You can have her"" by Waylon Jennings and he would have had a great concept album and considered it a kiss off to Priscilla.If he could have just gotten over her and on with his life he might not have died at the age of 42 of a broken heart.My personal favorite songs are ""Hurt"" ""I will never fall in love again"" ""Danny Boy"" ""Solitaire"" and ""Bitter they are, harder they fall""."
4,For the Heart,"No single performer in the history of popular music gave more of himself than Elvis Presley. This album, recorded at home in Graceland near the end of his life, is melancholy to be sure, but a strong effort that has grown in reputation over the years; down but not out, Elvis still gave his all. ""Solitaire,"" ""Hurt,"" and ""For the Heart"" are the classics here, but Elvis' spare, reflective reading of ""Danny Boy"" and an impassioned ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"" are every bit as compelling. Essential!"
2,Over-hyped,"As likeable as Scott is, there's not a lot of pith to this film. Interesting behind-the-scenes stuff, but that's about it. Much of the sound is poor and it's difficult to separate the speaker from the background noise."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,"This reunion Cd of the Clarke sisters is phenominal! Every track really brings the spirit! ""Blessed and Highly Favored"", these sisters truly Are!"
3,One Last Time,"I was slightly disappointed by this cd. I have loved the Clark Sisters for a very long time, so I did not get the old flavor that I am used to from them. However, I was happy with ""Jesus is a love song"". May God continue to bless the Clark Sisters."
4,They Haven't Left yet...,"I was so anxious to buy this cd that I counted the days until its release. When I heard the first song I said, okay, this is definitely Donald Lawerance (It was good). Then I heard, ""Blessed and Highly Favored."" What a beautiful song! Then I heard, ""You heard my cry"" loved it! I really love the Clark Sisters, though this isn't their best CD, the anointing and presence of God is still there and that's all that matters to me!! What I didn't like about this CD is that it seemed like they didn't ""sing out"" like they could have, they didn't ""let loose"" all the way like I know the Clark Sisters can. But despite all that, the more I listen to it, the more I feel Jesus in it!!"
4,Die Hard Fan,"I love the cd and have every album made by all of the Clark Sisters corporately and individually. The ladies of Gospel maintain their post as the premier women of anointed gospel. However, I did not appreciate the overdubs added by the producer Donald Lawerence. I know the Clark Sister songs so well, I could sing on stage with them! Unfortunately, the cd left me wanting for more vintage clark and desiring less of what was offered. I wonder if we can get them to do it one more time? I am sure they could do a final tribute cd. Here's an idea - A Salute to Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Maybe they should consider using pajam for production."
2,Dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I must admit. As big of a fan as I am of the clark sisters. I am very disappointed with the cd. I bought it today and could not wait till I got to the car and play it. The only song I really like is Blessed and Highly Favored. I think they over did the music and took the hard core soul (which is the Clark sister trade mark) out of it. I did not hear that Clark sister sound. I will continue to listen to the cd just because I am a hard core fan. I will always have love fot the Clark SistersBe Blessed
1,Should be the Last Time!!!,I have loved the Clark Sisters for so many years. I was so disappointed in this project. This is the worst cd I've bought this year. What were they thinking? There may have been 2 songs off of the whole cd that is memorable. The rest is terrible. This cd should be the LAST TIME!!
3,Great Camcorder but with low photo resolution,"It's a great Camcorder despite still uses MiniDV tapes. However, the attached Digital Camera has a low resolution (640 x 480) and it's the weak point of this equipment. The Zoom is great but requires a support for zoom."
1,DO NOT buy this camcorder,"This is the second JVC camcorder that I have purchased. The first one is still working fine. The new one however picks up a terrible motor noise from the camera. If you want to listen to a buzzing noise during all of your videos then buy all means but it, otherwise if you like clean audio I would not reccomend this camcorder. The camera makes a loud whirring sound that is picked up by the microphone and is very loud on the tape."
2,Not like the original record as I was hoping,"This isn't bad I guess, but I thought it was going to be exactly the same as the original Music Machine Album from the 70's. It is not! It is a story adapted from that album. Only 2 songs are the same and 1 of those is used more as background music. Another 2 songs are from the album but are remade and not that great. The rest of the songs are left off - I'm guessing they're on subsequent DVD's in the series. I was hoping this would be exactly the same as the original album just with a little animation, but it's not."
1,All scripture and Christian references scrubbed out.,"We were excited to get this video because we love the original audio CD. We were very sad to find that all scripture references, (except a watered down explanation that ""Agape"" is an old word that means love), were completely cut out of this movie version. So sad that the references to the Bible and to Christian values were completely removed from the music of the original CD. I would call this more of a ""nod"" towards the original Music Machine audio CD, with somebody making the sad decision to strip out all Christian references from it."
3,A bit disappointed...,"I ordered this about the same time that I ordered ""The Fruit of the Spirit"" Music Machine CD because I thought it would help visualize the music machine for my children. I was disappointed in the songs not being the original Music Machine songs except for Herbert's patience song and also in the story being more about the bad guys stealing the music machine than about teaching my children the fruit of the spirit. Great for teaching your kids how to be sneaky and to steal, but not so strong in teaching the fruit of the spirit. =( Disappointed."
4,Fun video,"My granddaughters really enjoyed this video. It did a good job of teaching the Fruits of the Spirit, but I was disappointed that more of the original songs from the Music Machine weren't included. Of course, the girls never knew they were missing, so they liked it."
4,Wolf Moon Shirt,"Of all of my cannine related shirts, this one may be my favorite. I was amazed when after I ordered this shirt my wife gave birth to a happy healthy baby boy... the amazing thing is we were not even aware she ws pregnant. When I put it on I began the slow transformation into a wolf myself just like Michael Jackson did in the beginning of the Thriller video. I was afraid I would scare my young son but my fears were swept away when he looked up from his crib and spoke his first words...""I'm a Wolf too Daddy"" and with that he let out the cutest little howl, it was like music to my furry, pointy ears."
2,Huh?,"I give this book 2 stars only because it started out in an intriguing manner. It very soon devolved into an inpenetrably ponderous plot populated with a confounding array of inextricably interlinked characters.I had little idea what the heck was going on very early in the story, and had no clue where I was by the end. Maddeningly unsatisfying."
4,"Not as good as ""Black""","Thoroughly enjoyable story by an author whose credibility with his subject matter is unquestionable. His cast of supporting characters has already started to lose luster. Byzantine plots inside the Beltway are getting increasingly hard to believe as we watch the ineptness of both parties as they really ""perform the nation's business."" By creating a shadow government that is really running things, Whitcomb tends to equate D.C. with Hogworts. All that having been said, the book is well worth reading just for the clear grasp of HRT procedures and some of the seamier side of the world we live in."
5,Whitcomb Hits Bull's-eye !,"Christopher Whitcomb just keeps getting better. His second novel, a sequel to ""Black,"" shows he's hitting his stride in fiction writing (his first offering was his FBI autobiography ""Cold Zero""). Throughout this thriller you can see him draw upon his own real life adventures. He also pulls part of his plot line right from today's front pages.As the novel races back and forth across the globe,his protagonist, FBI elite Hostage Rescue Team special agent Jeremy Waller, follows a Byzantine path that leads him to terrorists and official power structures within our own nation. This is the type of ""inside baseball"" that only someone who has worked in harm's way would know. If your a book collector save your first editions because they should become sought after as this action series continues. Get going on the next one, Mr. Whitcomb, your readers are ready for more!"
3,Enjoy getting the tech right,"Most authors have not the first clue about tactics and gear, but truly not so with this writer. I could actually feel myself inside some of the offices he described as we both there in real life, but at different times."
3,"Decent thriller, not quite up to author's previous work","After reading Cold Zero and Black (see reviews), it seems like Whitcomb kind of added this on as a decent, but not great sequel. I did enjoy the many experiences of Jeremy Waller and G.I. Jane in this book, but it seemed to hit a little further away from Whitcomb's real life experiences than Black. Still, there were many vignettes in Waller's story that rang true, particularly the family relationship, secret training facility and undercover work, and so on. Again, the elements of the story not within Whitcomb's personal experience (the politicians' and businessman's world) did seem a little less well conceived, but it was still a good read.**/4"
1,Discordant,"After reading White, I won't be reading Black. Character development is spotty, and the storyline jumps from sub-plot to sub-plot every few pages. The ending reads like an afterthought - like Whitcomb was so worn out developing the plot that he just decided to come to an end . . . any end. My response after reading the last few pages was ""Huh?"""
2,White Missed the Mark with Me,"I just couldn't get into ""White"" -- a convoluted plot that bounced around too much wasn't helped by cardboard, unappealing characters. I normally like espionage books, but after reading ""White"", I have no intention of reading ""Black."""
1,Slow and then slower,"With his autobiography ""Cold Zero"" Whitcomb showed that he knew how to write. With his fisrt novel ""Black"" he showed that he could write fiction. But after reading his second novel ""White"", I have to assume that he had a ghost writer on his first two projects and tried to write this one himself. ""White"" starts out fairly good. But it quickly devolves into convoluted and frankly unreadable cliches and twisted plots that never do connect themselves. One can only assume that he had a good idea for the first chapter and then had an aneurism which prevented him from logical thought for the rest of the book. Save your time and money. Everything in this book has already been done and re-done by Ludlum, Clancy and the TV show 24 -- and they all did it much better than Whitcomb."
2,Big miss,"I picked up this book after having seen a ""comment"" by Frederick Forsyth, a favorite author of mine and the preeminent master of this genre. I was quite disappointed by this book, not from what another reviewer calls an unbelievable plot. Rather, I found the storytelling amateurish (at best) with weak character development. There also seemed to be exaggerated use of multiple storylines to attempt to artificially inducing suspense into an otherwise bland novel.On the brighter side, it is obvious that Whitcomb has ""been there and done that,"" drawing on his background to provide inside details and terminology that other books of this type lack. That, however, was not enough to offset a clear lack of skill as a writer of fiction."
4,4 1/2 stars,"In this sequel, Christopher Whitcomb comes through with another well written thriller that's perfect for a summer read. A fast-paced wildly plotted thriller sure to please fans of his previous novel 'Black'. I Look forward to more in this series.Highly recommended."
2,How long until this becomes a cheesy Craig Sheffer movie ?,I loved black and I thought the plot for it was very original.But White is just to cheesy. It reads like every other weak political thriller out there and doesn't have the realism that Black had.Islamic terrorists and white supremicists are teaming up to take down the U.S. and of course the President might be in on it ? Coming soon to ActionMax or Showtime Extreme.What a lame plot. I can already see Stacy Keach and Craig Sheffer signing on to turn this into a film.
1,From Back Cover,"UNDERCOVER...Protecting people was Ryan Fitzpatrick's business - but being Clea Mason's bodyguard was going to be pure pleasure. After all, ever since he'd first laid eyes on the cool, classy business executive, he hadn't been able to think about anything except her body...And - if Ryan Fitzpatrick gets his way under the covers, too...Of course, she didn't think she needed protection. But he knew better, and pretending he was her husband was the only way to keep her safe. And if that meant getting close and personal with the lady, well...it was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it...[3rd in The Right Bride, Wrong Groom series]"
3,I still don't know why.,"There's this bridesmaid, and a guy (who becomes her bodyguard) sees her across a room, talks to her and is in love. Why? He's so in love that he'll aggravate his family, lie to them, suspect them and use them. But why? She's cool and uninterested in him, and it seems an over-reaction when we finally (far too late) find out why. He's given her a nickname. What has she done to deserve it? There are too many emotions built on a hint, without susbstance backing it up. Despite all of this, I got through the book. I just really had to be willing to suspend my disbelief and accept that these characters have something special for each other. Ms. Hingle gets the 3 stars for building suspense, (though I knew who the bad guy was as soon as he was introduced), creating a hero who knows how to care for his woman, and for nice love scenes."
2,Over rated and over priced,"After being asked to review this book for a friend of mine, I found it to be grosely over priced for it's content. The diagrams are as old and out dated as the photographs. At half the price it would still be too high in my opinion. I would advise anyone to get good samples from any book they intend to buy on the internet.Professor Williams"
3,A Mighty Vagabond,"In this picaresque autobiography, Jim Tully takes us on a teen-aged hobo's ride through early-20th-century America. Set in the hobo jungles, freight cars, trainyards, flophouses and brothels from coast to shining coast, the author introduces us to victims of a society that has no use for them -- literally the great unwashed -- men and women whose morality is dictated by necessity (most notably, hunger). Frightening in part, but also touching, and at times damned funny, Tully gives us a fine portrait of a piece of Americana that no longer exists as such, but whose inhabitants have still not gone away. Though tame by today's literary standards (I doubt that it could have been published in 1924 had it been otherwise), no thinking reader's imagination will fail to fill in the gaps of this ""hard-boiled"" story. After you've read this book you will surely be anxious to read even more by Jim Tully."
4,Good book - Circus Parade even better,"Beggars of Life is the most famous Tully book, but I like Circus Parade even better. If you see a used copy - grab it."
5,The first time Elvis met Jerry Lee Lewis caught on tape!,"As everyone knows, it's not really a quartet because Johnny Cash wasn't caught on tape. But Elvis, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were -- and this was the first time Elvis met Jerry Lee, who was at the time just the pianist on Carl's session. At this point in time, Elvis was already recording for RCA -- so it was quite a treat to have him drop by the Sun Studios.One of the highlights of the tape is Elvis telling the others about seeing one of Wards Dominoes (in fact it was Jackie Wilson) imitating him in Las Vegas. Elvis then imitates Jackie Wilson imitating him! Elvis also sings a version of Paralized (a song he had already recorded) in the style of Wilson -- and it is much better than the real recording!How great to hear young Elvis with his contemporaries, just singing for the sake of jamming.You can't ask for more."
5,YOU'D HAVE TO KILL ME TO GET THIS CD AWAY FROM ME,"If you call yourself an Elvis fan and don't have this CD inyour collection, you should be kicked in the head. What on earthcould be better than Elvis and Jerry Lee, the King and the Killer, taking turns singing lead and back-up for one another? If you don't have this, GET IT. If you've got it, PLAY IT MORE to hear just how truely great these guys really were. The sound quality is top notch, recorded in the hallowed Sun studio, and don't let the abbreviated duration of the songs scare you off; each one is a rare treat and a gem no matter if it's only a few seconds or a full take."
2,I didn't care for it,"A great book should be able to catch and hold your attention within the first few pages. I kept expecting the same from this one (all the glowing reviews can't be wrong can they?) but sadly I skimmed the whole thing, TRYING to find SOMETHING that could catch and hold me in the story... Didn't happen."
3,Average book,"This book was okay. I thought the story dragged on a bit, though the concept and characters were interesting. I won't read another story by this author though, so that should tell you I didn't really get into the story all that much. For free it was worth reading, for money not so much."
3,Politics and Murder in the South,"I really enjoyed this book and would have given it four stars except for early on when the f-bomb was dropped a few times. I'm not a prude so when a character appropriately uses that kind of language, it's fine by me, and tells me a lot about that character. In this case, I almost decided I wasn't going to like the character (the protagonist) but I hung in there. Maybe it was supposed to suggest that she was pretty tough or something. Fortunately, I did like the character, she was tough, and strangely, she never used that word again. I felt like it was a totally unnecessary sort of shock language, though. That aside, the story was good, the cast of characters realistic, and the mystery solved in good fashion. All in all, a good read."
3,Well written,I found this writer interesting in that they used large words. They also provided intrigue and suspense . I will definitely look forward to reading more from this author.
3,"Enjoyable, but not great","I liked the characters but I thought Casey Jones was at times a little too over-the-top, like her attitude and actions were forced to make her look tough. Tough is fine for this type mystery, but she needed a vulnerable side to endear her to me, the reader. I'd probably read another in this series, though, just to see if this story was a fluke because the story was good."
4,Legwork,I loved the setting and characterization and she made me keep a lookout for her real-life version. I'm giving it 4 stars because I thought it felt unedited. There's a difference between proofreading and editing. It was funny but sometimes it moved too slowly. I'm excited to see what Munger does next.
5,Glad I stumbled across this one!,"What I want to know is why I had to discover Casey Jones by accident. Think Kinsey Millhone's sassy southern cousin...or Judge Deborah Knott with an attitude...and I can't understand why she isn't as famous. She's hilarious and effective, and I look forward to reading more of her adventures!"
4,great slueth book. funny and well written,what a fun story! loved the clever development of casey's character. one of the best free downloads. looking forward to downloading the next story to see if the author holds up.
5,One of the most entertaining mysteries I've read in years!,"Katy Munger is a great writer! Casey Jones and the other characters are so believable. Casey is a smart, funny, wisecracking woman. As soon as I finished this Casey Jones mystery, I was ready for more. In fact, I e-mailed Ms. Munger looking for her next book, which is something I've never done before - and I'm an avid reader. (It will be out soon!) This is a must read for mystery fans. If you are not a mystery fan yet, Legwork is a great place to start."
5,Super funky jammin jazz!,"I heard one of these songs on an internet radio station, loved it so I bought the cd and was very satisfied. These guys are so funky, jazzy, cool, hip, and last but most important, tight! The cd is a blend of 70's movie soundtrack funk, spy jazz, smooth jazz (not too cheesy though!), a tad of reggae, and some r&b, all rolled into a super talented group of musicians who blend very well together and keep the groove going! No singing, which I happen to really enjoy. It's almost like a super talented, tight back up band for a jazzy singer made an album without the singer."
4,Drove me crazy,"This book drove me crazy - I was always peeking at the next chapters trying to read ahead. It is a good historical novel which flip/flops chapters from old times to current times, filling in the years of the generations."
1,Slow story,"This was a very slow story that never really seemed to move anywhere. I had hoped the movie would have been better, but it was even worse. I have read Sharyn McCrumb's books before and enjoyed them."
4,Walk in the Shoes of the Appalachian People,"Being an avid genealogy hobbyist and lover of Appalachian, I feel that Ms. McCrumbs has really the nail on the head in her feel of the Appalachian people and their history and genealogy. She has the ability to make the reader feel as if they were in the shoes of the Appalachian people even giving them lessons, as in how to pronounce the word, ""Appalachian"" correctly. I liked the story of the history of the song better than Lark's story. Lark was written as more of a shallow person than those left up on the mountains, but maybe Ms. McCrumb meant to do this. Also, the LeDonne chapters could have been incorporated into other parts of the book than being in separate chapters--leaving the reader to wonder, ""why tell the story of this person, if only to tell of the old wrecked plane.""I hope Ms. McCrumb writes more of the Ballad series. She has a permanent fan here."
2,Not her best...,"I've read all of Sharyn McCrumb's Appalachian novels and eagerly looked forward to reading this one. I did finish it, but it seemed far more chore than pleasure. We spent so much time bouncing around between characters in different times and places that I never really developed much interest in any of them. I hoped I would become hooked right until the last page and was almost relieved when I finally finished. If you've never read Sharon McCrumb, try her earlier novels, particularly ""She Walks These Hills,"" and ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter."""
2,Is NOT the official autobiography!,"Be VERY careful to be sure this is actually what you want: I bought it when Amazon recommended it in response to my search for the official autobiography. Since the seller did not have a disclaimer that it is not the official autobiography, I didn't know until it arrived and I was able to see the publish date that it was an unauthorized printing.For everyone searching for the full autobiography, which was printed WITH permission (this book and all others were printed previous to 2010 and thus unauthorized), you want the one edited by Smith, Griffin, Fischer, Frank, Goetz and Myrick. Volume 1 was released in November 2010. If your book is not volume 1 of a 3 volume set, it, like the above book, was printed in violation of Mark Twain's explicit instructions not to print his memoirs until 100 years after his death."
2,Major Letdown,"I don't have any idea what April Derleth was thinking when printing this volume under her fathers imprint. The editor puts down all the major writers to the point that I have to write this review. I'd like to see some of this editors own fiction if he thinks so low of Robert E Howard and Clark Ashton Smith. The sad fact is that their style of writing is virtually non-existant. Originality like theirs nearly died out with Moorcock and Leiber in the 70's (though William King is a new notable worth reading). With the plethora of 800 page ""I wanna be JRR Tolkien"" poser's currently permeating the publishing industry it leads me to see this book as more of the wide spread jealousy held against these great writers. The book is worth the stories and the dust jacket, just skip the intro's."
3,"Unless familiar with Moroccan culture, keep google close","I was drawn to this book because of its unique organization. I loved the ""short story"" style. However, since I was not familiar with the culture these characters live in, I struggled to follow along without sitting near my computer to look up all sorts of references. Still a worthwhile read."
2,Not that great,This works only for a short while....not nearly as good as the panasonic battery...pay more and get the real thing...If you just want a battery to work while the original is being charged then this works.Otherwise it does not. I would not pruchase again.
1,"Cloying, trite, irrelevent. This book disgusted me.","Much has already been written on this topic already. Deak adds nothing but his own opinionated propaganda.He tries to dazzle with his style, but fails to come up with any substance. Even his style is a bit antiquated and jaundiced. Reading this drivel was like feasting on a stale, cheap cakewhich refused to go away. He stubbornly refuses to creditwomen, minorities and queers for the sizeable contributionsthey made to Habsburg culture. A hidden agenda? One must wonder. After the horrors of recent European history, we can only hope a more honest, balanced account will come soon."
3,"Interesting, yet difficult to follow","This is an interesting book on the Habsburg officer corps and its role within the Austro-Hungarian Army, state politics and the social structure of the empire. However, Mr. Deak bombards the reader with statistics and charts, while intersting and helpful, are not effectively worked into the study and would be difficult for anyone not already familiar with the subject to digest. Subsequently, the books effectiveness is seriously curtailed. Some conclusions are debatable and some also seem to be a matter of personal opinion. If nothing else, this book gives a good sense of the basic structure of the Habsburg Officer corps."
1,A Boring Book About A Fascinating Topic,"Hapsburg military history is usually quite interesting,but in Deak's hands it is reduced to bland statistics anddry analysis. Hopefully, a better book will come along so interested readers will not feel compelled to suffer the boredom of Deak's style."
1,One of the dullest books ever!,"Frankly, I do not understand why Mr. Deak continues to torture us with his inane blatherings on the subject of the Habsburg family. When was the last time a Habsburg accomplished anything of any import, like leading the NBA in rebounds or producing a really cool MTV video? I'm sure that the only people interested in the subject are more boring than Deak's book, if that is possible. Two thumbs down"
2,No big deal,"No big deal. Bear in mind the fact that this book is about only the 1976 season, when James got his World Championship. For a complete biography of this late driver, get Gerald Donaldson's book."
4,Good value,"This set is a great price. A lot of fun episodes from this series are included. My only beef is that ""In the Soup"" was not included in this set, and is probably the episode that most people remember."
5,Great!!,"Loved the variety of episodes. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who loved ""Leave it to Beaver"". High quality picture. Just an all around great purchase. I have enjoyed it so much!"
1,(Kindle Version) User Unfriendly,"Because there is no table of contents and no hyperlinked index, it is cumbersome to flip through this book and find the section you need, making it a hindrance to using while at the park. I was hoping for the convenience of having this on my iPhone instead of carrying around a book while at Disneyland. But, because of the format, now I'll have to read each page and mark the info in my notes to reference later. What a hassle to have to flip through every page to try to find the section we need! The one good spot is that each ""clue"" is hyperlinked to its corresponding ""hint"" although it doesn't quite solve the organizational problem of using this ebook while in the park.Kindle versions of reference books should always have an easy-to-access, hyperlinked index and table of contents. When they don't, it not only makes the hard copy a much better value, it makes the kindle version almost useless.I wish I didn't purchase this book!"
5,Christmas Gift that was Loved,My sister-in-law is now looking even more forward to her Disney Vacation so she can find the Hidden Mickeys all over WDW.
5,One book for each son,"Got this for my sons. As Disney fans, they were looking for a new adding something new to our trips.These books will keep them occupied while waiting in the lines for the attractions."
3,This book is for families with small children.,"I purchased this book for my trip to Disney World December 2004. My son is 14 yrs old and his friend is 13 yrs old. Neither of them were interested in finding the hidden Mickey's all over Disney World. I would recommend this book for people with small children. This book is good for keeping small children ""playing a game"" all over Disney's themeparks."
1,Needs work. Poor layout,"I was expecting to get a great book full of even better information. What a surprise when the whole entire book was setup in a very random matter. The authors hunts are random. For example, at the Magic Kingdom, one moment you are in Tomorrowland the next you are in Frontierland and then back again to Tomorrowland only to go back to Adventureland. Many of the listed 'hidden mickeys' are not Mickey's at all! You can find better information online or just by asking the cast who work there at the park."
2,Below Expectations,"The book is a good idea but there really is way too much filler used to try and create a book. First you have the clue which tells you there is a hidden mickey in the area. Most people will not be able to find the HM with just this clue. The next part is a hint which tells you exactly where to look. I suggest you go straight for the hint. Many of the HM are, as the author called them, ""wishful thinking"". For example, hint 38, ""you are looking for an abstract Donald Duck...."" Also many are in a dark, fast ride that you would have to ride many times to find the ""tiny classic Mickey."" Having said all this the book is good start to giving you visit a little extra fun."
2,Not really hidden Mickeys,"Cute format. Cute Book. Now, if only half of them where actual Hidden Mickeys it would be a good book. Ex. The 3 in Spaceship Earth is not a hidden Mickey it is a 3. The imagineers when they create a hidden mickey, they try not to do hidden pieces of of Mickey. They only real piece of Mickey, I can confirm is his shoes at the Great Movie Ride. How do I know this is incorrect? I am a cast member who teaches programs all over the parks. I know what is real and what isn't. Remember, this book is not written by Disney Imagineer, it is written by someone who has visit the parks a bunch of times. This book is not offical."
1,"Nice enough, but nothing special","This book contains good enough information, but for a ""field guide"" it is surprisingly cumbersome to carry around and leaf through. (A pocket-sized, spiral-bound book would have been a better design choice.) 99% of this info is available online, so next trip I will just create and print my own checklist for a family scavenger hunt.Also, while the definition of a ""Hidden Mickey"" can be somewhat subjective, I personally don't think the Mickey imprint on merchandise in a shop should count."
2,Not what I expected,This book is not what I expected. It's more like a written scavenger hunt with clues. I wish it had some pictures to show the different types of hidden mickeys.
5,Hidde Mickeys,This was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter who frequents Disney World. She loved the book and was thrilled with it.
4,Pretty Cool,This was a really interesting book and I definitely suggest getting it before going to Disneyland rather than buying it there. Some of the Hidden Mickeys I'm somewhat skeptical about while others are DEFINITELY hidden mickeys. Either way its a really good price for learning a little bit of Disney history as well as finding some of those hidden mickeys. Its a great thing to do while waiting in line!
4,Fun and Go Seek,"Enjoyed the book! Handy to carry in the park and fun to hunt. It gave my family a whole new dimension during our last visit to Disneyland. I appreciated the two sections, an easy section giving away hints--easier to find the Mickeys, and a more difficult section for those who want a challenge."
2,"Horse whispers (saddle club, no 74)","I really hated this book. I did not think that it was very realistic. I think other books in the series are much better. I think this book was just trying to cash in on the whole horse whispering interest. Carole is enough of a pain at times with out having this ""special"" quality.I like the books that contain stories which are realistic and could happen to other people who ride horses"
5,THE best SADDLE CLUB book,"This is such a beautiful SC book. Carole bonds with the mare and it is really thrilling! Then Carole rides the wild mare to set her free. When Carole gets hurt as when the mare stops at her herd, the wild stallion stands over her. Then everyone on the Bar None discovers her, and Carole must explain why she set the mare free."
3,Try another one,"The Jefferson Airplane's recordings are curiously overlooked today; the sound (and some of the lyrical concerns) may seem a bit dated, but the tension between Marty Balin's romantic love songs, Grace Slick's upfront weirdness, Paul Kantner's counter-culture anthems and the incredible musicianship of Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Cassady and Spencer Dryden made for some wonderfully vibrant, creative music. This, however, is not the place to learn your JA. The running time is extremely short and there's only eight songs on offer; even at the price it's not great value. Try finding the Fulton Avenue compilation, or at a pinch The Worst Of Jefferson Airplane (although that one misses quite a few essential items). If you'd rather jump straight in, try to find the box set JA Loves You. All of these are a better introduction to the Airplane's music. I'd give the music five stars and the compilation one; so I've given the package three stars."
3,Is this REALLY necessary?,"There are a lot of Jefferson Airplane sets out there. We have 'Platinum & Gold Collection.' We have 'The Best of Jefferson Airplane.' We have 'The Worst of Jefferson Airplane.' The list goes on.And, we have this one. I'm giving this three stars because it is Jefferson Airplane. But that is the only reason. This has 'White Rabbit,' 'Somebody To Love' and 'Volunteers,' but it's missing a ton.Where are 'The Ballad Of You And Me And Pooneil,' 'Greasy Heart,' 'Watch Her Ride,' 'Come Up The Years,' 'My Best Friend' and 'Wooden Ships'? And, at 8 songs, THEY COULD HAVE EASILY FIT HERE TOO!My advice is skip this one and buy either 'Platinum & Gold Collection,' 'The Worst of Jefferson Airplane' or 'The Essential Jefferson Airplane.' Buy this only if you see it in a bargain bin."
5,A Fun Trans-Atlantic Mystery!,"Kid Caramel and his trusty side-kick, Earnie Todd, are back on the job solving life's perplexing occurrences. This time they find themselves whisked away to the country of Scotland in search of a classmate's missing grandfather. In addition to the missing relative, stories of the infamous Loch Ness Monster surfaces causing Kid's keen detective skills to kick into overdrive. Will he be successful in finding his dear friend's family member in time? Well, you will just have to read this one to find out!Once again author Dwayne J. Ferguson has written a superb story young mystery buffs are sure to enjoy. All of the interesting facts he weaves into this story about Scotland (based on a trip he took there in 1985) as well as cleverly including tales of the infamous Loch Ness Monster, made this story a major hit among our book club members. Now the country of Scotland has made their top 10 list of interesting places to visit. Mr. Ferguson is indeed a great storyteller!"
4,Some very good recipes,"The Ma Po Bean Curd is very good, as is the spinach with peanut butter. A very nice book, I thought."
1,SAD,"My glasses actually arrived in one piece, delivered by UPS. I ordered 2 sets (for a total of 8) but I only received 6 glasses. One box only had 2 glasses in it. I want to keep the 2 since I can't get a replacement but I haven't heard if they will refund 1/2 the price, or make me return the 2. I am still waiting for a reply. They were delivered in a big box with absolutely no packing material other than a single small sheet of plastic, so UPS did a fanastic job of keeping them in one piece. I don't see how it was possible with so little protection. Especially after my mom received so many broken. What a waste of a beautiful glass. Does Amazon not realize how upsetting it is to get a broken product or just half a shipment. Shouldn't someone be doing a much better job of checking to make sure an order is complete and packed well????"
1,WRONG MERCHANDISE,"I ordered the set of Goblets for my grandmother. I was very excited because I had finally found something she would like and I could afford. When I received my order, it was all wrong and it was too late to send back and get the right order. I was very disappointed. Apparently, this must happen often because when I went to the site to see about returning the item. There was a special link for people who received the wrong merchandise.The price may have been great. But the quality of service sure wasn't."
5,Mit 17 fangt das Leben erst an,"This CD is wonderful. Ivo Robic has a fantastic voice. I could listen to him every day and never get tired of him. If you like beautiful music, this is a wonderful CD to add to your collection."
1,Disappointing in the extreme,"Jay Brandon is one of my favorite authors and I looked forward to reading his latest. What a disappointment. Absolutely preposterous plot. Cartoon bad guys. Predictable ""surprise"" ending with short shrift given to major plot elements. Though, somehow, it's probably his book most likely to be turned into a film!"
3,Its Strengths Come Early,"I put this CD on the player for the first time in probably a year last week, but the fresh listen only reconfirmed the long-standing impression that, backhanded compliment, it would have made an almost perfect EP. Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning, 'Cause Cheap is How I feel, Thirty Summers and, most powerfully of all, Neil Young's Powderfinger are fabulous songs performed beautifully. Where Are You Tonight? salvages the second half of the CD a bit, but the other five cuts frankly are much closer to two stars than five stars. Rock and Bird and Witches in particular manage to be both silly and pretentious at once, the kind of writing a college sophomore looks at a few years later and cringes. I'd advise checking out Cowboy Junkie Best of's for the top cuts here, rather than buying The Caution Horses."
4,Great alt-country/country rock,"The Junkies started their catalog with The Trinity Sessions, an EP of refreshingly slow songs and covers recorded in LA's Trinity Church. Caution Horses' songs are faster but still slow, and feature a melancholy accordion in addition to the usual country instrumentation. This is one of the Junkies' best albums, second only to their third, Black-Eyed Man. The lyrics are tart and sardonic yet delivered in a breathy, flat contralto by the lead singer. This album and the aforementioned Black-Eyed Man are their most distinctive and therefore their best. As they gained experience, the Junkies' began to play faster and faster, losing much of their distinctiveness."
2,A Cautious Album,"I am a HUGH Cowboy Junkies Fan. However this is I feel the weakest of all the albums released by them in their career. Especially after their first two worksWhites Off Earth Now!! and The TrinitySession. Still this album is not without its moments. Certainly a couple of my all time favorite CJ songs can be found on here. ""Cause Cheap is How I Feel"" and the Neil Young song ""Powderfinger"" are amoung the best hits that the group has ever put out. While these songs alone make it worth the while to buy this record ""Caution Horses"" is a disappointment compared to their work they released prior to this album and what they have released sinced then."
1,This album is a flop,"I had heard that the Caution Horses was a terrible album, but I love the Cowboy Junkies so I thought that there were bound to be some redeeming qualities. There weren't. This album sounds like the band wasn't really interested in making a quality piece of art, but rather wanted to recapture the succcess of the Trinity Sessions without putting in the effort or the love of music which that album so abundantly had. This album was an anomoly, it is a horrible album from a band that has consistently maintained the highest standards of song writing and performance. Any other Cowboy Junkies album will be well worth the price you pay for it, this one isn't worth a nickel."
3,The Secret... Polynesian Style,"An interesting take on the law of attraction, or ""The Secret"". The author explains that ""huna"" means ""secret"", so ""the Huna Way"" of the subtitle is ""the secret way"", and likewise, ""kahuna"" means ""the secret"". There was a good mix of practical meditation techniques and tips, and a general reminder to be in the present, aware of the now, and to see the world the way you want it to become.To be fair, this is a reprint of a book from the mid-1980s, reprinted to take advantage of the hunger for all things law of attraction related. But the author lost me regarding such discredited and fraudulent phenomena as Orgone energy, Kirlian photography, the telekinetic powers of children, and other, very much firmly in the area of pseudoscience.If you can mentally redact this portion of the book, you would enjoy what the author has to offer here."
2,"Disappointing and way, way out there.","I am open to all manner of philosophical and metaphysical thought, but this Huna business was too much for me. The tenets spelled out on pages 10-11 of the 1993 paperback version are the pay-off of the book. The rest is tedious and devoid of any practical applications. Not passing judgment on the validity of this school of thought as a pseudo-religion, but I could not connect with this material."
5,Excellent Psychological Information!,"I have been a student of many books and courses, including ""A Course in Miracles"" and ""The Way of Mastery"". This book does not contradict what I have learned, but it DOES ADD critical information about how to create and implement the positive life changes most of us want, particularly in regard to the workings of the subconscious mind. The author is unassuming, direct and clear about all he says. It easily rates five stars."
3,Interesting and boring,"I kind of skipped around. Its good info, I just found it boring. So look at the outline and see if its right for you."
4,Wisdom-filled and practical,"Good introduction to Huna worldview and philosophy. Particularly interesting for those readers who are familiar with basic tenets of other belief systems, e.g. Eastern, Native American, Judeo-Christian, etc. The parallels shared by all major religions and worldviews are brought to the fore. This short read is worthwhile; wish it were accompanied by a CD for guided imagery and meditation."
5,The truth!,"This book explains everything, psychology, sociology, cosmology and it is easy to read, best self help book I read."
2,Not impressed,"Heard a lot of great things about this book, but I wasn't impressed. Most of this stuff you can find online, but I guess its useful to have all in one place. My own humble opinion is that if you are making the effort to make your life better by reading books like these, then you are already 90% there."
5,"Great read, enlightening, and empowering","This book is a wonderful addition to any personal library- learn more about your perspectives in life, etc."
2,fraud,"The blurb above touts an optimizing compiler. The product box does too. When you get to using it you find that the first line in the build log states ""This edition of Visual C++ does not support the optimizing compiler."" When you try to set the project propety for optimization you find it greyed out and unavailable. So much for truth."
1,An overwhelmed beginner C++ programmer,"After starting out learning on Bloodshed Development's free C++ development suite, I bought Microsoft C++.NET in hopes of finding it easier to understand. Now I am totally confused!The resources (wall charts) included with the software look pretty when tacked on the wall of my workroom, but they have done little to help me create any useful applications.If you are new to working with C++ (or programming in general) you will find that Microsoft increases the learning curve dramatically with this product. Find something less complex."
4,good,If you like Dj'ing or music in general you will love this....im not really into djing very much but I like A-Trak's sheer. Musical talent. Not enough house music but its more about his rap influenced style.
1,Boring Beyond Belief,"If you find paint drying a thrilling thing to watch, then this Quaalude of a movie will be for you. Want to know the story?: Married guy has a mistress, loves her more than wife, tells wife who doesn't like it, and they try to get along at a Christmas gathering. The end. There; now you can save yourself the money and an hour and forty minutes of excruciating boredom."
3,For small pliers does the job,"Not for large pliers, average to small sizeFits standard pegboardSuggest using plastic pegboard locks to avoid frustration of putting back peg every time you remove tool."
5,Must have toy,"I bought this for my 5 year old for XMAS. It did take 3 hours to put together, but boy was it worth it. My son loves all of the games and when he misses he says he must keep practicing to get better.The electronics on ours works fine and it is such a wonderful added feature."
5,Worth the time & money!,"Our seven year old son desperately wanted this for Christmas. He was delighted to come down Christmas morning to it. He has already spent hours playing it and went to it immediatley upon waking up. With so many ""game cubes"" and ""play stations"" out there, we wanted a toy that was fun, but did not allow him to sit in front of the tv for his entertainment. (That and the fact that dad was very excited to try it out). Very detailed instructions. Great pictures and written directions to figure it out, BUT plan on at least 3 hours to put it together, especially if you are doing it solo. Great gift that is fun and durable. Even our three year old is enjoying it."
5,Great Game,This was purchased as a Christmas present for my twin sons (5). They absolutely love the game. It was assembled on Christmas eve with help in just two hours. The only problem was that the basketball sensor for scoring did not work. Contacted Fisher-Price and the replacement parts are back orders for 45 days!
3,A little dissapointed,"When did the ""HOT"" toy start costing $200? Well, my son had to have it and overall he really likes it. The Baseball and football are pretty much identical and the basketball is the best. Golf, soccer, and hockey...well, he did it once and thought it stunk. The golf ball is rubber and sticks to the carpet or floor so i had to give him real golf balls to use. The hockey doesn't slide well either. Essentially, if interested, consider saving $100 and get a basketball only toy.Also, the size is rediculous. I don't have enough room in my 1,800 SF home to put it and not block something else."
5,THANKS SANTA,"This was the only thing my five year old son wanted from Santa and thank goodness he delivered! My son has spent hours, along with his dad and his three year old sister playing on this monstrosity! It took my husband three hours to assemble it, but he is mechanically inclined so this may not be reflective of how long it might take the average assembler. It was next to the Christmas tree for a couple days before he wrangled it upstairs to the bonus room. All we have to say is if you are planning on purchasing this item you better make sure you have plenty of room! Hopefully we will not experience any difficulties with the audio as others have reported, as we think this is one of the greatest features of the item."
1,Set aside lots of time to assemble,This toy arrives in a million tiny pieces. I can't imagine my child playing with it for as long as it has taken to assemble. Take a couple days off from work...
1,One of the worst toys in years !!!,"This toy is one of - (if not the) worst made toy that I have seen in years - there are way too many of pieces that need to be put together and very poor instructions telling you how to do so.It is an over priced nightmare, that will cause you more stress putting it together than you can imagine. The first hint of this should be the piece of paper that you read when you first open the box (saying in large bold print) : DO NOT RETURN THIS TO THE STORE! Save yourself alot of strees and do not bother with this over-priced piece of junk!"
3,Nightmare to Pure Fun,"I can not believe they expect people to put this together, my brother and I put bikes and toys together all the time. It took us over five hours and the instructions were poor. I know many people that could not put this type of thing together and it would have ended up in the trash. All that aside it is a great toy for anyone over the age of say five or six. Nice sounds and great gameplay and does fold up nicely. I would have paid someone a lot of $$$$ to assemble."
2,espn gamestation,We bought this as a Christmas gift for our son and we have already had to replace the scoreboard once. The replacement scoreboard is not working now and we have only had it for about 3 weeks. The basketball hoop has infrared lights to tell when a shot has been made and they are not working anymore. I am really disappointed with the product considering the money that I paid for it. If I had not had so many problems with it I would have givin it a 5 star review.
1,Disappointing,I was hoping this book would give me some quick new ideas to add something extra to my photos. What I got was some of the same stuff I've seen in books that have already been around for a while. I was really disappointed. I especially didn't feel like I got very much for the price.
4,Very nice for collectors of Waterford crystal.,"This is a large (13.75"" x 9.25""), 256 pages, heavy book printed on high quality paper. It was published in June 1981, so any new suites introduced in the last 30 years will not be included. It has a lot of good quality photographs and a good review of the history of Waterford.It's a must have for people interested in collecting Waterford crystal that was produced more than 30 years ago."
3,Peppermint Patties,"My order came when I expectd it to come, I had no issues with the seller. I am enjoying my order. There is only one thing that I am unsatisfied with this order and that is that all of the bars seem to be stuck to the wrappers and are wet. Not sure if this was due to weather or not, there wasn't a cool pack to keep them fresh in the package. Other than that I am pleased with my order."
4,A Starting Mint,"York Peppermint Patties are another of my favorite mints. While Junior Mints are little dime-sized bits of peppermint flavored candy covered in dark chocolate, York Peppermint Patties are significantly larger, though the patties are also peppermint flavored candy covered by dark chocolate.I think it is interesting that York Peppermint Patties, which I think I remembered eating for most of my life, only began national distribution after Peter Paul acquired the York Cone Company in the early 1970s. Also of historical note is that Cadbury Schweppes then merged with Peter Paul, and Hershey Foods then purchased Cadbury Schweppes' U.S. candy operations.If you like this delicious mint pattie, you should also consider trying York Limited Edition mints that are produced from time to time. Enjoy!"
5,A Rhyming Adventure,"""Suddenly, Thomas' driver saw trouble ahead. `Slow down!' said the driver."" -From the bookIn this rhyming adventure, a huge thunderstorm hits the Island of Sodor, and hail from the storm creates a crack in the track-bringing the entire Railway to a screeching halt. Thomas was carrying many passengers, but the crack in the track forces them to get off the train. Bertie the Bus eventually comes to the rescue, but a toad in the road requires the passengers to unload. ""What will happen to us?"" the people ask. Percy, Gordon, and James get stuck behind Thomas, and the Troublesome Trucks refuse to back up. Will the passengers ever get to their destination?Unlike many Thomas the Tank Engine stories, especially the ones geared to older children, there is no taunting or rudeness among the engines. Everyone cooperates and helps each other (except for the Troublesome Trucks!).A Crack in the Track is a hardcover The Cat in the Hat Beginner Book (a division of Random House, Inc.)"
1,Not written well,I cannot believe this book was ever published. It is the worst book I have ever read. There is no flow to the book and the rhymes are a stretch. The book jumps around and doesn't have any flow to it. I believe this book was written in a matter of minutes. Perhaps it was published because it has Thomas the train in it. VERY disappointing. My son does like the toad in the road but that is about it.
5,Essential material for the serious Cornell fan,"I'm immensely satisfied with this book. The photography is beautiful and does as much justice to Cornell's work as can be done in a 2D format. But the meat of the package comes in the DVD-ROM included. the sheer volume of information, images, films and resources presented is nearly overwhelming. The close-up, navagatable, hi-res images of Cornells collages, boxes and objects, the written essays, histories and intervies, and especially the elusive collage films presented in a beautiful, fun to navigate wonderland of extra stuff make the DVD alone worth the price. and you can get it for something like 20 dollars less online? and even if you buy it for full price, if you're seriously into having everyday access to this amazing artist's work, you almost can't afford not to get this. anyway, i like it. hope this helps."
2,poor bookbinding,"I was considering purchasing this book so I borrowed a copy from the local library to have a look at it first. I'm sure I was only the second or third person to borrow this copy as it was just entered into the library catalogue. The book literally fell apart in my hands the first time I opened it. The binding is extremely poor. This is inexcusable for a book in this price range.As for the content... it is nicely illustrated. I haven't read the text yet but I suspect you would get more information about the man by reading the ""Joseph Cornell, Master of Dreams"" book which I thought was very good. The DVD-ROM is very good as well but I find all that clicking here and clicking there to see various things to be a bit annoying. I would have prefered a DVD movie that would play on a TV.I would say it's a good book (4 stars) but the atrocious binding ruins it."
1,BEWARE! No DVD included!,"The book is ok, I guess, but if you expected the much-lauded DVD to be included, you'll be disappointed. There is no DVD! The photos in the book, alone, do not do justice to Cornell's creations!(Especially for the cost...)"
1,Do NOT buy these headphones!,"When I opened the package, one of the leather ear cushions fell off. Luckily I was able to put in back on. Also, when I plugged them into my iPod, the sound was horrible. Then, the worst part of all, when utilized the noise-cancelling function, the internal microphone caused a horrible, witch screaming high pitch noise that was extremely painful to my ears. My ears hurt for over an hour after it occurred. Please save your money and do NOT buy these headphone. The earbuds that come with the iPod blow these away."
2,Disappointing,"This is not what I hoped it would be. I should have read the fine print. This dvd proclaims itself to be ""The ultimate self-teaching method."" It tells you have to assemble and maintain your instrument, how to produce sounds, how to read music. It gives you a chance to play songs with a ""backup band."" Does that sound great? Sure it does. Do you think you can legitimately do that in 22 minutes of instruction? Ah...nope. Yes, this DVD, this ""ultimate self-teaching method,"" is 22 minutes long.This would be a great thing to pass out free with a new trombone. But it's not a self-teaching method. I imagine that the average buyer will be as disappointed as I was."
5,Stunning.,"I'm not generally moved by music. I'm not a luddite or a square, but music doesn't do it for me. This did it for me, and I mean it: hit me square in the gut. By the end of the album, I felt changed, which is the mark of great art. I loved it. You will, too."
2,Eh,"It's not terrible, but you can get all the same information online easily....if you like to own hard copys its alright but otherwise I'd say save your money and get something like Rosetta."
5,Great product!!!!,Awesome quality! Awesome background paper! And I didn't have to spend hours steaming it like I did with my fabric backdrops.
1,But...,"His pants don't fall down.Kind of gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""12 inch action figure.""Also he doesn't say ""I feel your pain"", ""Bridge to the 21st century"" or ""I did not have..."""
3,Roman Empire Book,"The book was fine, but it was marked on more than what was let on. It was shipped quickly and was traceable."
2,it reads like a gossip column.,"Although this book is highly informative, Starr's writing style often hinders the reader from fully comprehending the scope of what is being written about. Starr seems to jump from topic to topic and cross century lines with little or no notice to the reader. This book would be a great companion text to another volume of Roman history, but on its own, it is very difficult to decipher."
5,Advice You Can Use,"Believe it or not, my bank advisor suggested this book - after my umpteenth phone call asking her advice about various financial problems I was having. And now this book has become my new bible of advice ! I could not believe how much I learned in such a short time - and how easy the book made it seem. There was something in just about every chapter that applied to me, my life, my finances,my future - you name it. Highly, highly recommended. If, like me, you thought Dow Jones was the designer who made those great wool slacks ( that's Jones NY !) it's time to buy this book - it's the best money you're going to spend all year."
2,disapointed,"I was expected real zen quotes and parables not bob dillan and Coco Chanel and other similar characters quotes . ...there are probably 30% of the book that are truly zen sayings, but even they are not the best ones"
5,Just a real handy check-up,"From the inimitable Walker Percy (""not to be onto something is to be in despair"") to the counterpoint of cosmic interrelationships between zen and nuclear physics, this book can be anything from a 'thought for a day' to a thematic bible for speakers.I hand it to first-year law clerks who ask ""why"" too often, as much as recommend it to people who try to answer Les McCann's question ""real compared to what?""This is not a zen book as such. It is a wonderful quote-by-quote reminder that simplicity of thought and action is closer to truth than noise and clutter. It's zen lite maybe, while it is also accessible and thought provoking. A traipse through it's pages will always raise a smile and some recognition of having seen something clearly. Pick it up. If you don't like it, you know someone who will."
3,Okay but not great,"This book is okay, but not great. I like some of the entries in it, but if you are looking for a source of Buddhist wisdom, be aware that many of the quotations in this little book are not from Eastern sources. I prefer a book of Buddhist wisdom titled ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold."
4,"Wit and wisom, abbreviated","First, it's not ABOUT Zen. It's a collection of quotations and anecdotes that -sometimes - illustrate a few Zen concepts. It's like looking at a flower through a multi-faceted crystal. Every viewpoint changes the perspective and gives you something else to see. Meanwhile, the flower remains the same.Some of it is wise, some of it is deep, some of it is funny, some just clever. Sorry - it's not the can-opener to enlightenment. Some people get upset when they don't get that instant gratification. This isn't a step-by-step instructuon manual.Just read it and enjoy it without preconception. Meditate on it if you find something particularly worthwhile. Or don't. But just don't make it into something bigger than what it intends to be; take it as it is: a small collection of interesting and often pertinent pieces, with a little humour thrown in.Read it one page at a time, and it'll last a long time. I find a different view of the flower each time I read - or re-read - a page."
5,FOR ANYONE who doesn't mind thinking...,"This book is wonderful, even if you are not into zen. It has all the best quotes and sayings, eastern AND western, funny, profound, or familiar. It is a good book for a break at work. Keep it handy on your desk or in your bag for a quick time-out!"
2,Could've been sumed up in a paragraph.,"Basically the book makes one point -- it just keeps making that point over and over again and explaining it detail. I read the book cover to cover in just under 2 hours. Hire people who click with your organization. Just because someone is successful someplace, doesn't mean they will be in your organization. It's because of poor hiring that the average executive lasts only two years. Analyze your specific needs and how the candidate will help you overcome it. A better book for hiring is: ""Sales Management"" -- details about hiring a sales person, but very applicable with all employees."
5,Great Item,Just what I needed to store my 12 x 12 inch papers. Will have to buy more for the rest my papers.
3,Not What I Thought,"I have several other Artbin storage containers for my 12x12 scrapbook paper. I thought this one was bigger than what it was. So, it's ok, it's Artbin, but it's just smaller in depth than I wanted."
2,"Why, God, why?","Why was Skal given the inspiration for a concept he just couldn't handle? Oh, the agony! The idea of a robotic body replacement syndrome in modern America is brilliant. So was Skal's idea of how to treat the topic-- a societal neurosis, like anorexia, a talk-show scandal. But the execution! Arrgghh! The therapist who helps the afflicted is not only unbelievable, his character is gratuitously disgusting. The novel works when it keeps us on the edge of being drawn into a technofetishist's fantasy... but suddenly, we're there, the robots are here, beep beep. The effect is stupid. Would have been better if Skal had just stayed in the now-world and made a mainstream novel instead of going bad SF on us. Shame on you, Skal! You should've spent an extra year on this novel, or let somebody else write it! In addition, Asimov's intorduction is insufferably vain, something like ""I thought of this first in my short story _Segregationist_."" Whatever, Isaac."
3,Microsoft has a very deceptive website,"For the money, I guess I can't complain. The standard edition is a fraction of the cost of the ""full meal deal"", but wish that MS wasn't so deceptive with their advertising. Microsoft's web page for VB.Net 2003 standard edtion displays all the features of the full blown version and none of the limitations that are in the standard version are listed. Given that, I would still buy it as this is my only choice. The one big limitation is that the standard edtion will not talk to a real SQL server data base. It will hook up to a MSDE database. I did discover that I can talk to an Access database that has tables linked to a SQL server database, so you can fake it, but I can't do Stored procs.MS used to have a page that listed the differences between versions, but I can't find it now. I don't think you can develop mobile applications either.Good luck"
2,Great marketing - short on delivery,"Microsoft has once again succeeded in making a fairly uncomplicated programming enviroment, COMPLICATED. That is not, however, my problem with VB .NET, because after all, if you read up, you will quickly adjust to the platform. My problem is that if you don't buy Visual Studio, you will simply not have the tools to build advanced applications. As usual, if you want a robust MS product, get ready to shell out a weeks worth of pay."
2,Just Get VS.NET,"Although this package is cheap, you'll be severely limited. I highly recomend buying the full blown VS.NET package, you'll be glad you did."
1,Pure Garbage Buy the FULL VERSION-TRUST ME,Dont waste your $$$$. I couldn't even create a class library. I cant imagine using this to develop anything.
4,Foundations,"Its been a pleasure to work with Lee in his Kenpo video series through Panther Productions. This book titled Kenpo Foundations illustrates the basics of Kenpo stances, blocks, strikes and their applications. I would definitely recommend this book to Martial Arts of all ranks. Its easy to follow and gives an excellent illustration to the foundations of Kenpo."
5,"""Simply The Best""","This album is timeless. I loved it when it first came out back in the late 70's and love it even more today. The vocals are right on and the music has a melodic haunting quality about it that keeps you coming back for more. One of my favorites on this album is ""sunshower"". The drums will put you under it's spell and the child vocals will pull at your heart. If you listen carefully to the background vocals at the end, you could swear the Manhattan Transfer had a part in the song."
5,i betcha the love bug done bit cha.... oh yeah.....oh yeah,"as their song says ..... "" it's hipper than hip "" and i love it.... the dr must have had a great time operating on this patient .... you can certainly hear it and i am sooo glad to see it on CD .... i think this is one of the all time best records ever recorded ....... enjoy"
1,Incomplete and poorly done.,"New to the state, I hoped that this guide would give me some variety from the few areas I was familiar with. However, I was disappointed that, as an intermediate climber and familiar with getting my way through the woods, I had a hard time finding the climbs as depicted by the diagrams or text. Once I did find them, I was disappointed by the quality. Furthermore, there was no data on lead lines and the info on Shenandoah Park climbing regs were a ""little off."" Politely pointed out by a Park Ranger.Nice try but it needs more substance and perhaps more research."
2,"O.K., but not great.","I bought this book because I wanted to get additional beta on climbing at Old Rag Mountain (Shennandoah Nat. Park). The maps and drawings of the climbing routes were pretty vague. However, the book does indicate some climbing areas in the state of Virginia that I was not aware of."
1,Useless as a climbing guide,"The author clearly spent a lot of time driving and hiking around VA, but the actual climbing content is basically useless. For example, the Old Rag information is impossible to decipher. Crag photos and overview topo are a must in a climbers' guidebook, but there is not a single photo in the book. I think the publisher is to blame for printing an ""unfinished"" book. Certainly NOT worth $22..."
1,Not worth the money,"Climbing in Virginia is predominately done by locals and this book does nothing to bring many of the obscure crags to the attention of local climbers. Many good areas in the southwest portion of the state were not even mentioned, which is sad because some of these areas are the best in the state. It is obvious that there was not a great deal of research done in the creation of this guide and its diagrams of the individual areas published leaves much to be desired. Line drawings can create confusion for the reader which is not a good thing for a guide, however topographical diagrams in conjunction with the line drawings could have made this situation better. Yet the best alternative would to be to combine the drawings with actual photos of the cliff line. Due to the lack of information and poorly designed maps I cannot recommend that anyone buy this guide. They would be better off asking a local climber and saving the money for gas."
4,Virginia Climber's Guide is an excellent resource.,"Reading some of the other reviews, I almost wondered if this guide book would be worth the price. I decided to read it however after glancing in the introduction and seeing what was the basic intent of the book. Jeff Watson clearly states that the purpose of the book is to provide a listing of areas and routes for climbing in Virginia. I found the overall map on pages 6 and 7, as well as the opening paragraph in each section to be very informative. This book is only a guide and does not have all the information for each area because it covers many sites in Virginia. Climbing is an adventure and many of the answers are discovered along the way. This book is helpful in knowing where to start the adventure in the beautiful state of Virginia."
1,worst guidebook i've ever seen,"this guidebook has absolutely no info on trad lines and contains little detailed info besides driving directions to an area. plus the cliff drawings are either incomplete, too sparse or generally unuseful in orienting yourself. there are no topos, little indication of bolt lines or anchors but if you just want an idea of where a few climbing areas are go ahead and buy it."
1,pathetic,"General information is bland. Descriptions of routes sketchy at best. The parts dealing with 'ethics' and 'accessibility' are potential entries to a yet unwritten history of content-dodging.There are standards to how climbing routes are described in sketches and diagrams. This book ignores them. It will be a miracle if you find your way based on this information.As someone that wants to *actually* climb in VA, I simply had to toss Watson's book and get another one."
3,Great song!,Unfortunately this CD had a small count of tracks. It is more of a sampler than anything else. I just bought it because Electrica Salsa is a song of the past for me.
4,Perfect to complete the Spode Christmas table setting!,"These are the first pieces of Spode glassware I received as a gift over 8 years ago. I love them so much that I now collect all of the china and matching pieces. I bought another set of highball recently and these are not as durable as the older ones thus the 4 stars vs 5 stars. Noticed that the newer batches has ""Handwash recommended"" stickers on them to prevent the gold rims from wearing out. I used to load all of them into my top rack dishwasher without any problem. Nevertheless, these are perfect for the holiday season. I would highly recommend this pattern to anyone who is looking to start a collection!"
3,Doris Doris,"Not bad. Songs from different periods of her career, and with different sound quality. Most of them sound corny these days (you know ""I'm a woman and I desperately need a man to become a perfect housewife"" theme) but all in all a good collection of sons.Cheers"
3,Postwar photographs of people in SS uniforms.,"This is a little 66-page book of people wearing SS uniforms. There is some limited amount of descriptive text. The information is not of sufficient detail to be of interest to the collector, but should be quite useful for the model builder. The photographs are of excellent quality."
1,bosch reconditioned saw,"the blade guide assembly was defective, the saw did not work---I had to purchase a new blade guide assembly from bosch for 9.00. If this does not work then the saw is worthless Thanks bscdray1@verizon.net"
5,A Perfect Gift!,"I bought this book for my mother, and she reported that as she started reading it she started to cry. It hit the spot! I also bought a copy for Aunt Belle, my 86-year old aunt in Ft. Lauderdale. She reported that she loved reading it, but it seemed to be ""too much work"" to actually write down her memories. I told her to let the idea simmer for a while. Aunt Belle called back the next day to say that she had shared the Legacy Guide ""with the canasta girls at the pool"" and they started fighting over it. It seems that everyone had a story to tell, a memory that they had not thought about in years - maybe decades. The ""canasta girls"" talked Aunt Belle into working through the book, and writing it all down. This is the perfect gift for anyone in your family whose stories you want to know."
1,Cracked during install,I received the pump and was hoping to do a quick install. I am using it as an in-line pump (not submerged) and so it requires that a fitting connect from a tube to the intake port. The connector was a plastic piece and just tightening that into the pump cracked it! Fortunately Amazon is sending me another and I hope the next pump will work.
3,Danner Mag 9.5,Description is incorrect. Notes it some with a foam prefilter and only comes with a plastic piece for the end. I would rather of had the foam prefilter as advertised.Too bad.
1,Amazon get your act together ! ! ! !,"Here is a discription of what I boughgt :Danner 02720 Pond Mag 9.5 950-Gallon-Per-Hour Pump with Foam PrefilterInstead of giving me a FOAM PREFILTER they gave me a cheap plastic cage in the shape of a cone to protect ther filter. Any small debris could pass throught the openings in this cheap plastic cage. I called Amazon and told them how I was cheated they did make it right and are overnighting me the proper foam filter that was advertized with the pump. On one hand I was so mad on the other hand I was happy that Amazon made it right with me. It almost seems that Amazon is slipping a bit in customer satisfaction from 2 years ago. Even the picture of the pump on the product page is misleading. The picture shows a smaller model than what you actually recieve. I am seriously concidering not shopping with amazon because of their mistakes. PS: the factory box was damaged but the packing box was in good shape, no contents were damaged.Aaron"
3,Not good for what I was Using it for,"I got this pump because it is a measurable or an inline pump. I have a rain water collection system and I wanted to use this pump to run my water sprinkler. The line pressure was not very good.... maybe 7 psi. I would have given it 5 stars because it seems to do what it is supposed to, but the intake and the outlet are made of plastic, when I was screwing the inlet onto the outlet of my rain water collection system, it cracked the pump head. I was not turning hard, I just put some Teflon tape on and turned it one handed a few times, then ""CRAACKKK"". I will be sending it back and will be looking for a product that gives higher line pressure."
5,Great pumper,I purchased this to replace a Barracuda 1/4 HP Thermoplastic Utility Pump which continually tripped the GFCI and would occasionally stop working altogether. The old pump was rated at 1800 GPH as compared to the Danner at 950 GPH. The Danner pump vastly outperforms the Barracuda pump despite being rated at 50% of the flow. NOTE: This pump comes with the Rigid pump filter and not the foam filter as stated in the listing.
5,this is the second of these pumps I have purchased,"I have been satisfied with the performance of the first of these pumps I purchased, and I expect the same performance from this one. I purchased this pump to keep my pond going while I maintain the first pump (clean the impeller). These pumps are dependable and easy to maintain."
5,Great Puppet!,This fireman puppet is easy to use -- and expressive. We love his removable clothes and rod system. His elbows are marvelous. We can do a lot with him. He helped his policeman friend give CPR a few weeks ago -- and was very convincing. We are truly enjoying him. What's not to love? His clothes even have reflective strips! How great is that?!!
3,"Good Puppet, Wrong Color","My mother and I got together to order a bunch of these puppets for my son's new puppet theater. He is very excited about it because he got to help build it wih me. We were all very excited and anxious in our wait for the puppets to arrive. These puppets seem very decent quality for the money and are in fact a lot of fun to play with. Our one caveat to that is that they each look the same as the other, save clothing, and are not the color shown in the photos. The fireman puppet photo, for example, looks like a light complexioned, red haired fireman. There is a lot of defininition in the face and contrast between facial features. The reality is much different. The skin color is more of a hispanic or latin tone, and the hair and mustache are roughly the same color. There is little to no contrasting definition between them. We feel that this detracts from the overall image. All of them came this way. Still, they are fun to play with, and my son loves having them."
5,Perfect Gift,This was a gift and it is everything we expected. Really nice puppet. Well made! SATISFIED! Quality product! Thank you very much! I recommend Melissa & Doug
1,"""Say It Right"" lacks psychological insight","Ms. Malandro's book ""Say It Right the First Time"" has surface appeal, yet ultimately fails as a self-help communication manual, primarily due to its inability to understand the psychological principles (such as unchangeable self-interest) behind much miscommunication. The book is full of advice that seems intuitively right, but when put into practice does not pass the ""reality"" test."
4,Say it Right,The book is a very good resource for anyone who is in a supervisory capacity or needs to talk to other people in the performace of their work.
5,Right on the money,"As a veteran communications trainer with over 20 years of training and leadership experience, I found this book encompassed very 'actionable' advice, practical insights, and meaningful guidance for those sincerely interested in becoming better communicators, leaders, and people. I strongly recommend it."
3,"Does NOT include ""Fuzzy Sapiens""","Believe the product description, not the reviews. The current edition ONLY contains ""Little Fuzzy,"" which is available free from Manybooks.net. There was apparently an earlier edition that included ""Fuzzy Sapiens,"" which is the book I really wanted since I already have Little Fuzzy. Thank goodness for Amazon's 7-day return policy."
5,Worth writing a script about,"I first read the Fuzzy stories over 30 years ago, at which time I began drafting a screenplay based on the Gashta (Fuzzy) saga. It lay in a notebook until a few months ago when I renewed my commitment to bringing the story of Little Fuzzy to the masses. The script now resides on my laptop where it is being polished while I await word on the legal aspects of carrying out my dream... to see Little Fuzzy join (if not lead) the ranks of Gremlins, Ewoks and other sapient furry beings everywhere. Is the world ready for ""Little Fuzzy""? let me hear from you..."
5,read it a long time ago and often. Its still a good read,I read this book when It first came out and bought it again every time I found it. One of my favorite books
5,Great Story,"Great story, I read it years ago and have been wanting to reread it for a while now. I was greatly pleased to see that it was free on Kindle. It's a wonderful heart warming story!"
3,"Enjoyable, but simplistic","I did enjoy this book, but it is rather two-dimensional. The only complexity offered by the book was in regards as to how sapience is defined.I didn't find much mystery or adventure in this story. It's the kind of story that is so sweet and simple that, when you are done, you feel like you're on a sugar high. I just like my sci-fi with a little more complexity. But, despite all of that, it is a quick read and an occasionally sweet/simple story isn't that bad :-)"
1,Buyer Beware,"As for the story Little Fuzzy by H. Beam Piper one could not ask for a better read.As for the product you get when you order the story ""Buyer Beware"" you, as I did, may get something other than ordered if you don't look very closely at every element of the description page. The ""Paperback"" I ordered turns out to be 8 x 10 inches and has a generic cover which is appropriate as the book has no copyright or publishing information. If this story is not copyrighted then this is clearly a cheap copy by someone looking to make $9 for something which is otherwise free, if it is still under copyright then this book must be an illegal copy. Either way what you will get is a great story in the worst form I have ever seen."
4,Great flats,"great flats but the heel is covered in leather and the sole is very thin, heel wears out quickly."
3,Very cute but also very OUCH!,I'm just not sure I can tolerate the pinching around the toe area enough to break these shoes in. They look adorable. I want to wear them so badly but they just kill my feet. Maybe once the blisters heal I can try them again. I just don't know.
4,Beautiful Shoes,"These ballet flat are beautiful and comfortable. They do hurt in the beginning, but I used a few old tricks to get them to loosen up. When I was growing up, my older cousins used a thick rag soaked with rubbing alcohol and tightly put them inside the shoes for a few day, I did two days and it worked like magic."
3,Inside the Inside Passage,"This 250-page book contains factual information regarding many activities at the ports of Ketchikan, Sitka, Juneau, Haines and Skagway. The ports activities are divided up by the amount of time you have to participate in the activity. This is a text heavy book without many images. The descriptions are short and concise including addresses and contact numbers for the activities. The problem is that there is not enough of a description or recommendation to allow the reader to pre-plan which activities they really would like to do."
5,Elvis Presley's favorite fragrance,"Brut was Elvis's favorite fragrance, and this size container is not a misprint. Enlarge the photo and you can see the ounces as stated on the container you receive. It's a great value!"
5,Brut by Faberge,"I got tired of always buying the little bottles of Brut and when I saw this bottle on line, I immediately purchased it. I can't imagine ever needing to buy another since it was so large. The price was very good and the service and delivery were excellent. Thank you"
2,fragrance is not so great,Well this was my first time trying Brut and I am disappointed with how it smells. Either amazon sent me a stale bottle (as if it matters) or it is popular in certain type of people :-)I did not like the perfume.
1,yuck,Terrible. I'm ashamed to give it away. A skunk might find this odor to his taste. Maybe Pepy Le Phoooo.
2,Brut Barber Shop Scent,"It smells like a barber shop, that's about it. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it's good to spray on sweaty workout clothing to make it smell better."
5,Brut Cologne for Men by Faberge,"Brut Cologne for Men, by Faberge, is a man's cologne - but designed with us women in mind. My husband doesn't buy it, I buy it for him (Me)! If it were up to him, he'd still be wearing that stuff with the ship on the bottle!Brut's unique smell encourages being close. It doesn't enter the room well in advance of its wearer - then linger to drive people away. Close is good... even in us married folk!Brut Cologne for Men is available in several sizes, splash or spray - but I like the value I get buying the 25.6 Oz bottle from Amazon.com. Generally, I'll buy a small Brut spray and then use the large bottle for refills."
2,Not so great,"Gifted half a dozen of them to my dad since he is a big fan of Brut, unfortunately he didnt like it so much. Says that the fragrance doesn't match the original Brut. Disappointed!!"
4,My Old Favorite,Just like I remember it when I was a young man. It was my favorite cologne back then. Very inexpensive by today's standards but same nice product.
2,Hardback is Misleading,"I purchased this dictionary from Oxford's voluminous line because it was a good price for a hardback cover, which I felt would be more durable. While the cover may be more durable, the binding is cheap glue rather than a more reinforced binding that usually comes with a hardback. This weak binding becomes a particular problem because the book is very thick and requires the reader to force it open widely to be able to read at the inside margins of the pages. I have only had the book for a few months, but it does not seem as though the binding will last very long."
4,"Something old, something new...","This is the dictionary I grew up with. For more years than I can remember, POD stands for an authoritative yet handy source of guidance for the English language. I still keep an old edition, which was published long before the Soviet Union collapsed.I bought this latest edition out of curiosity. This new edition obviously bears a modern look. Its definitions are concise, clear, and unequivocal. Unlike the Merrian-Webster series, which sometimes substitute a synonym for a definition, this dictionary defines every single word in such an accessible way that the probability for confusion is largely minimised.However, the apparent dismissal of IPA and the adoption of a brand-new system of pronunciation symbols have caused some confusion. Having been used to the IPA and the system of M-Webster, I don't think I need to bother to learn a third respelling system."
2,"Well, it had to happen....","Twenty years ago I bought this book (7th edition) when I arrived as a foreign exchange student to study in the US.I vividly remember the joy of finding a bounty of precise and clear definitions in thisfantastic book. I even copied a number of them out by hand and pinned them up on wardrobe, and I was a science major!For example, I remembered the definition of ""concise: ""brief but comprehensive in expression"". How couldyou say it any better.Well twenty years later, I proudly buy the current edition for my young son, hoping to pass on this joy.And boy, did they dumb everything down into oblivion. This stinker of a dictionary is now fullof trivialities and consciously low-brow wordings. The new entry for ""concise""? It says ""using few words"".The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is that none of the other dictionaries I looked at were any better; seemsto be a lost cause."
2,topper,I purchased Topper Volume 3 for $ 7.69. It is okay if you have never purchased the Topper series but a while back I bought TV Classics THE ADVENTURES OF TOPPER for only $ 3.99 which has 9 episodes. Volume 3 only has 3 episodes and 2 episodes out of the 3 are in the other DVD. there is a bonus episode of Joe Palooka which I didn't think is very good. Buy the ADVENTURES OF TOPPER. Is is a lot cheaper and a lot better.
3,Should have been all mono,"Although I enjoy the stereo masters, the original LP was done with original mono masters. The CD should have also been done with mono masters. We have all kinds of Elvis greatest hits packages in stereo. I notice some people mention this collection does not have this song or that song. This is the CD version of a 4 LP set that was issued in 1970, so that would leave out anything released after mid 1970. And, it also would leave out anything that want not released as a single and, it would also leave out any single that did not sell a million copies as of 1970. This is a GOLD SINGLES record compilation.The Other Sides: Worldwide Gold Award Hits, Vol. 2includes million selling flip sides and million selling 45 EP releases, and a couple of million selling A sides that sold a million copies since this was issued in 1970 and The Other Sides was issued in 1971."
1,Complete Fiction,"This is what Roman Polanski had to say about Thomas Kieran's book on him in a 1984 interview: ""It's really humiliating having to delve into these books, but there is one by a certain Kieran, for example. Everything in it is false, from start to finish. It's complete fiction, pure and simple."
1,Red belly ring=bad idea,"This belly ring is really ugly. It looks like a growth or a zit or a sore or something. It wasn't worth $1.99. It is not the company's fault, I wanted a red belly ring. But I don't want it any more."
1,NOT A GREAT GUESS WHO COLLECTION!,Take my advice buy or get The Ultimate Collection 3 discs retrosepective overview [Box] set is much better than this one and you'll thank me for it later on someday.Because this CD ranks a one star review in my opinion!
4,God still delivers today!,"I just want to comment that Jesus Christ is truly sufficient. Even though some people turned to doctors when they are severely sick, I have personally known of cases where people diagnosed with level 3 cancer (cancer which has spread to lymphatic systems) has turned to Jesus Christ for help instead of chemotherapy which only promises a 50% recovery chance. And these people were healed fully, in Jesus Name! They went for medical scans and the cancer cells are totally no more. And I talked to doctors about this, they said it cannot be fathomed medically. Trust in God, He calls us to have faith in Him."
1,Not worth the paper,"This book is poorly documented and poorly argued. The bias and reactivity of the author get in the way of anything that might have been potentially useful. Basically, Christian psychology is reduced to enhancing self-esteem and nursing victimization, thus reducing a highly complex discipline to the stuff of ""pop-psych"" books. The author has no apparent credentials to discuss the topic intelligently and it shows. He is driven by his agenda and this is nothing more than a conspiracy theory."
1,Horrible,"Horrible product. Spring did not work on arrival. Even if it did work, there is no way this product would last long. There is just one ""spring"" (a bent metal rod) in the middle of the door sweep that flips the door sweep up. This mechanism is cheap and does not work well."
3,An odd confectionery,"The Doctor takes Ace to Terra Alpha to investigate disturbing rumours, they are soon plunged into the political intrigue of the planet: a dominating leader, secret police, the chief torturer, and a suppressed native race add up to a standard-style story, but here presented as an interesting confectionery.Taking a leaf out of the Second Doctor story 'The Macra Terror', the environment of enforced bonhomie manages to make being happy somehow threatening. It also has a nod to Franz Kafka - like Josef K in 'The Trial', all the inhabitants of the planet have a single letter as their surnames.Containing several obvious swipes at the British Government under Margaret Thatcher, although one would hesitate to try to name who the Kandy Man represents! The Kandy Man is the chief executioner of Terra Alpha, and specialises in death by confectionery.A little bit odd, a little bit traditional, a little bit over-sweet. You might like it, but it may also be a little bit rich for some tastes."
4,Pastoral perfection,"The very essence of John Denver is presented on this album of his most famous compositions. Leaving On A Jet Plane and Goodbye Again are different in that they deviate from his well-known pastoral style and are moving on a more personal level. One can just about smell the pure country air on songs like Take Me Home Counry Roads, Starwood In Aspen and Rocky Mountain High. Denver's talent for the soaring, inspiring melody is enhanced by his poetic gift. Although Denver is not considered one of the more profound songwriters, he definitely made a valuable contribution. As an exponent of melodious folk pop in the bucolic vein, he was superb. The only big hit missing here is Annie's Song. This album is all you need if you just want his most memorable songs."
5,Laughed and cried!,"I met Marlin a few months ago in Chicago. He was our guide for the ""Tragic Events"" Running Tour and made the most terrible stories in Chicago's history absolutely spellbinding. I ran with 6 other family members and Marlin would bolt ahead of us to take pictures of us and definitely put his own personal touch to the whole tour. Afterwards I found out he wrote this book and immediately ordered it as I enjoyed his storytelling on the tour so much. I am so glad I did! Once I started reading it I just could not put it down. I found myself laughing out loud often and crying several times as well. Marlin is so very inspirational and such a genuinely giving person. Like other reviews said, even if you are not a runner, this is a must-read. It is one that is relatable to anyone on so many levels. I think the part that touched me the most was the love he displayed for his wife, his best friend. Thank you Marlin for sharing your family and your beautiful stories!"
5,The Real Deal,"Having known Martin on a personal level as a friend and business partner for several years, you will not find a more genuine, likable human being. His story will captivate, inspire, and motivate you to find and pursue your purpose-driven life! Enjoy the read!"
5,"breathtaking,exceptionally well writen ...",at this book Kadare reveals the his genuis on what just a few contemporary writers of that time could ...and as a matter of fact i was deeply disappointed when he was not awarded the nobel prize.i have read many of his titles and they are a world class..
5,Wars and their aftermath,"One of the most brilliant novels by a much neglected novelist, finally coming into his own, the beneficiary of excellent translators and a prestigious literary prize."
4,Truly mind-bending!,"Surrealism is not really my cup of tea, but I did enjoy reading this book, which treads on slightly firmer grounds of realism than Abe's other works. The structure is certainly interesting, as the reader is given as few clues to understand the story as the protagonist has in his case, and things get progressively more confusing and unclear. The whole thing has a dreamlike quality to it. I can't say I loved it, but if you are looking for a challenging and slightly avant-garde read with a surrealist bent then this is worth a try."
3,Old stuff compiled,"Greetings to Sherlockians. This collection has the three Arthur Wontner titles: Murder at the Baskervilles, The Sign of Four, and The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes. If you can stand seeing the house as 221A Baker Street, they're not too bad.The final selection is the delightful (though painfully miscast) Reginald Owen in a nice cover of A Study in Scarlet.For my money, I'll stick to Rathbone. All the best to all."
5,The Best of Faron Young,I think this is one of the best Faron Young tapes. I bought it for My elderly Mother and its all she will listen to...Thank You.
4,Not really a KJ-52 fan...,This dude is crazy in the Christian world like Eminem is in the secular world. He a very talented artist and this album is very nice. I can't even knock this dude a little bit. There really are some bangin tracks on this album.
4,Worth your money,"This guy has been around for a while and though I prefer The Cross Movement, LaCrae and Flame he's got a fun sound. Flame is super serious and Cross Movement is crazy meaty so sometimes I want something light and fun as well as deep and he's able to do that. Check him out."
3,Good Stuff,"This is a good lighthearted cd. He doesn't ever seem to take himself to seriously. Few good songs that are strong in the word. If your looking for some good strong Christian rap, I would like to recomend a group/rapper(not sure if its his band or just him) called Flame. Just started listening to them and every song is pretty powerful!"
4,KJ IS A JUST MAN,"KJ says ""just"" way too much on this album. Anyone else notice that? Top 3 songs: Do You Got That, Push up, You Can Still Come Back."
4,Excellent General Background,"I wanted a general background of Southeast Asia before I traveled to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. This book was exactly what I was looking for. It leaves out Burma and the Philippines, but it goes all the way back to prehistoric tribal migrations and ancient language groups. I recommend it as a general history of SE Asia (minus Burma and the Philippines)."
3,OK book to read on the plane to SE Asia,"It is an OK little book, and covers a lot of ground... Would buy it again (partly because of the paucity of other choices) - but it is a bit incoherent, jumps from subject to subject and leaves one quite confused at times. Poor Messrs. Barwise and White had a monstrous task to accomplish - condensing so much history in a tiny volume; perhaps this undertaking could not ever be successfully completed! - and hence sometimes his decision to keep in or omit certain events appear a bit whimsical.But all in all, I do wholeheartedly recommend this book if you are going to SE Asia for a couple of weeks, and want to have some historic context."
5,A quick read and a great way to get up to speed on SE Asia,I thought this was a super book. The authors have done a great job of synthesizing the history of Southeast Asia into a very readable survey of the region. I would refer this book to any traveller or international business executive needing to quickly get up to speed on the history and culture of the region.
1,Cheap ploy to capitalize on real artists,"As with most of Belden's music, his formula has been to pick up on real artists' innovations, Sting, Prince and rework the music into varying sizes of big band ensembles. True, most of the jazz up through the 50's was based on preexisting songs, that is indisputable. But those songs lived on their own without lyrics, so instrumentalists could play them and make them live. Most of the musical part of pop music today, let's face it, is a life support system for the lyrics. Without them, the music is one-dimensional and uninteresting. Belden has skill, to be sure, but his well-worn formula of parading out current stars' music so that he can try to popularize himself is just another example of me-ism of the 60's and 70's culture."
2,Very short,"When you activate the chirp/song it only last 5 seconds! Too short to enjoy. There are samples of this bird song, on line, that are longer.I am very dissapointed. There was no indication that it would only be 5 seconds. On the up side, it does have authentic song."
5,good for anybody of any age,"I purchased this for my new girlfriend (she loves giraffes) well when i gave it to her i wish i had a camera so i could share to you the facial expression she had when she saw it and then the smile she had for the rest of the day we started dating 2 days later, she loved it. i belive its soft enough for small children to have, (btw im 23 shes 21, thanks for reading my review ;)"
5,Very pleased,"I ordered this product on a Friday, and it arrived that next Thursday. Excellent service! Also, the collar was just what I wanted. It matched the leash that I ordered, was made of good material, and had a standard plastic snap clip. It's also easy to adjust, and not a huge hassle. Overall, it's great. Fabulous product and service!"
2,I would not recommend this book.,"I am a practicing engineer (in analog design), with an MSEE. Having taken numerous courses in linear analysis, circuit theory, and DSP in my college and graduate school study, I tried to use this textbook in helping my understanding in Matlab modeling of signals and systems.I found the matlab examples in this book terrible. The code were poorly organized. (I personally write in C and Perl.) I also agree with one of the reviewers: There are a lot of typos in the textbook.I would not recommend Amazon readers buying this one."
2,"poorly organized, poorly edited","The text certainly has very comprehensive coverage of signal analysis for an introductory course, it certainly lacks the depth needed for an advanced course. And unfortunately the writing is so poor and the typos so numerous that the book cannot help but confuse and discourage those first learning a pretty complex field such as signal analysis. There were several mistakes in the Fourier and Laplace transform tables in the rear of the book which is simply abominable. The emphasis on computer examples and solutions is a nice feature and is implemented better than most other comparable texts. But I don't think that it's enough to redeem the numerous other flaws of this text. If I was to recommend an introductory text, a good one would be DSP First by McClellan which has lots of good computer examples and some nice exercises with real signals such as images and voice. A nice intermediate text is Digital Signal Processing by Proakis."
2,Poor,"I've bought this book, and I am quite sure it doesn't worth.I'd recommend ""Linear Systems and Signals"" - Lathi (much better choice)"
1,Poorly done examples and poor book,"This book has too many typos to be considered anywhere close to an authority on the subject of Linear Systems. In the first day of class, I received a errata sheet over 6 pages long. Also, the professors that teach this class barely use the book for their class, and I go to the Universtiy of Missouri-Rolla, the Univeristy that the author is still teaching at! I never open this book to supplement my studying of the subject, and at times, this book confuses me even more than I already was."
1,Horrible Book,"I'm an undergraduate electrical engineering student at the University of Kansas, and I can't stand this textbook. Consulting this text is nearly worthless. There are occasionally some decent examples, but the depth and amount of mathematical analysis presented before you even understand the concept is enormous. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone seeking help in the signals/systems area."
3,An Interesting Story . . .,"The author is a dwarf, married to another dwarf. His form of dwarfism carries with it severe orthopedic handicaps, causing him to need crutches, while hers is more benign. Matt Roloff is a plucky little guy, an extrovert, ready to meet all and take on any challenges. He has an amazingly positive attitude and has coped well with his ""handicap."" He and his wife are less than four feet tall; together they have four children, one a little person, but three of average size. Matt speaks of his Christian faith in helping him to cope. Part of his story didn't appeal to me much--he builds huge play structures on his property, yet claims to not be overcompensating. This book was written with a ghost writer, whom I don't think did Matt justice. At least, the writing style was rather pedestrian. But all in all, an inspiring story, and an intimate glimpse into a world not my own."
5,"Got problems? Read this book, wake up, and start living!!!","If this book doesn't teach you how to see past your problems and realize ""Hey, I'm alive, I should start living!"", nothing will!A truly inspiring story. Matt is truly different from the rest of us in one remarkable way; he dwells on life's highlights, and figures out how to make them brighter. It's an ability we all have, but it's amazing how infrequently most of us practice it.Buy this book and remind yourself how to live life to it's fullest. Thank you Matt!"
5,Asian Underground,"If you loved Talvin Singh, as I did, you may love Karma Club. It has more of an authentic sound of India.. It's not as ""slick"" as Talvin Singh and I like that. There are many different atists on this CD (mostly from India and Nepal).And the cover art is GREAT!!!"
2,one hit jewel,"I heard THE PINEHURST KIDS' ""The Onceler"" on the radio and I liked it a lot. It had a nice, energetic BUILT TO SPILL mixed with SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE sound, and I had high hopes for the rest of the album after reading reviews of their ealier work. Unforunately for me, the rest of the album is unremarkable, and track 2 stands out like a diamond in the rough."
3,Meh,I expected more from James Allen to be honest. I read a lot from his web site and that is pretty decent for the most part but this has put me off buying any of his other stuff. I like some of his analysis points but for the most part it's just a boring chronology with very little flare and VERY uninspired writing.
4,Objective,"I was a Ferrari fan (not anymore) and never like Schumi. I have to say this is an objective book, do like it. Quick shipping from UK"
4,used purchase,"Item arrived very quickly in great condition from the UK. Good read, very happy with purchase."
2,Good book about Dick Dastardly,"This is a fairly good book about the most ruthless driver ever. He raised the bar upon Ayrton Senna legacy, trhat's for sure. He was ruthless, unapologetic, friendless, cruel on the track.Schumacher never allowed a competitive driver to take the second seat in the teams he was. He upgraded the ""art"" of downgrading a team mate to levels previously unknown to Formula One. So, however his numbers and records, I don't miss him a bit in F1 races. Much on the contraty: his five championships in a row for Ferrari where, for me, the blackest time of Formula One."
5,Wonderful panoramic view of the history of Delhi and India,"William Dalrymple has a great writing style and a deep apetite for understanding the historical and cultural context. He neither takes the clinical distant approach to his subjects neither does he use a patronizing attitude to India. If you have been to Delhi, the book will be a great reading; if are planning to go there, it should be required reading. You will enjoy your trip so much more. Even if you don't go to Delhi, it is just a wonderful reading. Olivia has done a great job in her illustrations."
5,Good journey.,You have to be really into India and all its madness and glory to enjoy this one (which I am) but it really transports you to this country's magnificent and tragic past and to its tragic present of garbage heaps and crumbling domes and beggars in the streets. A keeper.
4,Historical book about India,Fascinating vivid historical descriptions of India...... I found it riveting at first but it became somewhat dry and repetitive as you passed beyond the first third.
3,is really so easy?,"this book is great.I really like the way W.D. describes his living in Delhi, he is funny and he never patronizes.I found strange how he always finds this amazing people there just to help him.he is very educated but sometimes I think he shows off all his knowledge..anyway my next trip to india will be to delhi"
4,Don't Replace Oneself With a Stranger,"Mildred, a heart-broken girl, wants to run away from everything. When a hitchhiking girl killed herself, Mildred takes her identity to live a completely new life.It is crazy to replace oneself with a complete stranger. It would be an artificial story if Mildred's despair were not convincingly described. And it would be tiresome if her misery were tediously described. Gardner describes her hopeless feeling concisely but convincingly. He is an excellent writer. No more explanation will be needed. Please enjoy how Mason brilliantly rescues Mildred from predicament.This book is written in 1958. The general public is so strict to an unmarried pregnant woman that she will be driven to suicide. It is interesting how times has changed."
2,Disappointing,"When I purchased this book, I thought it was going to be much more scathing and critical of the Bible than it actually is. I delved into the book and was done within 20 minutes. The book is much too short, contains obvious mistakes and oversights, and seems unprofessional in many ways. It makes an attempt to be humorous, which it does occasionally pull off. I myself am a freethinker, so I expected much from this book but was left dissapointed. Pass this one up!"
4,A Case of Mistaken Identity.,"It is a staggering coincidence. Like the author of this book, I see the Bible for the rank absurdity that it is. And like the author, I wrote a tome debunking it. But unlike the author, I have both a M.S. and a J.D., and my unpublished book was by all accounts better....And yes, I am involved in writing religious comedy: I run the Bob Larson Fan Club website, an expose of the wacky world of televangelism. It reveals what Christianity REALLY is: The original inspiration for Amway.Obviously, my anonymous critic is frustrated by the substantive criticisms I level against Christianity -- and his inability to refute them. And like the Christian he evidently is, he sought to punish me economically for beating him and/or his views to a bloody pulp on USENET.And like so many of his counterparts before him, he missed. :)"
5,Hurray for Honesty!,"When I read this book I felt Al Franken looking over my shoulder. And that is good. Seems that all these fundamentalist (and somewhat fanatical) Christians want you to take every single word out of both the Old and New Testaments literally and without question. The thing is they select chapters and verses they want to preach, interpret them for the proper amount of fire and brimstone, and conveniently ignore how the whole Bible makes no sense nor has any applicaton today. Then again, evangelicalism is big buck business. Thank you, Ken, you gave me a lot of chuckles sticking pins in this ballon!"
3,"A good book, but incomplete","Ken's Guide To The Bible is an enjoyable, quick read, but is not complete enough for readers not completely familiar with scripture. While Mr. Smith's analysis is often amusing, a lot of times, he does not print the passages he is interpreting, and the reader is not able to draw thier own conclusions about his interpretations. A better read for people interested in this kind of stuff would be ""Don't Know Much About The bible"" By Kenneth C. Davis. Mr Davis offers the in depth analysis that Mr. Smith is lacking. I did like Mr. Smith's theory that Jesus may have been a fatso,though."
5,oh what a breath of fresh air,"I wish this book was widely knownso tired of the social control maniacs wrapping themselves in the hodgepodge that is ""the Bible""this lays out how completely contradictory it is, and how full of nonsenseChristianity is the ultimate blasphemy, created by Paul. Who killed Jesus? easy, the Christianswhatever it was that the actual Jesus was up to, it was quickly and thoroughly coopted into its oppositeand now we have Armageddon locked and loadedhistorical basis? no longer relevantd"
1,"Funny, but...","While this book reads with a great deal of hilarity and many seemingly convincing arguments, it seems irresponsible to draw these arguments from any other source but the original language (Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, etc., depending on the section of the Bible). The Bible is simply not meant to be taken literally word-for-word, especially in a language so far-removed from the original. Even the most fundamental of fundamentals must refer to the original texts to acheive a greater understanding of what the Bible contains. So, before you go out and inform the world of what a hoax the Good Book is (if you are a non-believer) and before you go run out of the house screaming (if you are a believer), think twice before reading this book and realize that not only has the Bible been proven even by the hardest atheist to be a valuable archeological resourse, any descriptive literature--especially translated literature--will breed shocking results when taken word-for-word."
1,P.T. Barnum was right.,"I've read many so-called refutations of the Bible, and this is yet another. Most are based on the author's lack of understanding of the time period of the particular biblical book they attack, ignorance of Jewish and early Christian history, and a general bias designed to rationalize their chosen sinful lifestyle. Such a pity that people would waste all their time reading such sophomoric nonsense as this and not spend any time reading the Bible itself."
5,Tongue in cheek truth,"Although Ken Smith presents his analysis as if it were a tabloid newspaper (see cover), the book is all quotes from the Bible. It is hard to dispute the ridiculousness of some of the things he quotes. It was certainly an eye-opener for me, and would especially be so for all those who are devout Christians or Jews.His commentary at times is insensitive, but he obviously is a skeptic of organized religion. Also, at times he blatantly applies his own interpretations. However, he is forthcoming with this in the introduction and later.It would be a great starting point to find controversial verses for anybody who is feeling the heat of Christian or Jewish fundamentalists, or missionaries in the prior case.A good start, but it could be offensive!"
4,Intentionally Unhistorical,"Critics of this book argue that it is not scholarly--it takes passages out of historical context and absurdly applies contemporary values to ancient scripture. This criticism is entirely correct, but I think Ken means to do just that in order to counter all the Bible-beating-bigots (like Dr. Laura) who just love to cite the Bible out of historical context and pretend as if it were the repository of incontestable truths. Ken's just fighting fire with fire--albeit he has a better sense of humor than any Christian I've ever met.The book is somewhat modeled after the ""Idiot's Guide to..."" series, with short introductory sections and little pictures in the margins to indicate what topics are being addressed. A quick read, Ken's Guide to the Bible gives you plenty of ammunition against Bible Studies people (not students of the Bible) who know only the Bible that they want to know."
1,awful,"I feel that the book is misleading. Ken Smith has taken bible verses and twisted them around. If you want to know the truth, sit down and read the bible yourself, if you don't understand some things, seek advice from from bible study groups or just ask God to help you understand."
1,Dumb Book From Any Perspective,"Don't bother buying this book. It has little to offer in the way of scolarshhip or content.Those who believe the Bible will find fails to understand what he reads.Those who don't believe, equally will find his arguments shallow.Many of his ""facts"" are in error. Single sentences taken out of contex and read in today's English can be laughable if one doesn't attempt any scolarship.Believing or not believing, this book offers the most cursory coverage I've ever seen.If this is an example of Mr. Smith's intellectual reach, then it brings his other works into question.Don't bother spending money on this one!"
1,Utterly wrong and deceived,"All I can say is, May the Lord have mercy on someone that defames the Lord Jesus Christ and his word. Anybody that does this is speaking out of total ignorance, I challenge you to research into the Bible for yourself with an open heart and not go by what others say about it."
4,cant go wrong,"here it is an incredible collection of tunes from the sonar kollektiv label. enough said. sonar kollektiv is in my opinion the most interesting label around. track two is the reason i bought the disc. joe dukie and fitchie ""midnight marauders"". this is the most crucial reggae track that i have heard in years. forget sean paul, ""midnight marauders"" is a masterpiece. be on the look out for remixes, heard a drum and bass version that was outstanding although i like the pure roots reggae vibe. the other tracks are all of outstanding quality as well, you cant go wrong with sonar kollektiv tracks.... especially when they are mixed by jazzanova and dixon......"
4,Concise book for reading,"This handbook is easy to approach. It provides general information about infectious diseases, although not comprehensive in detail. For medical students and those who are not specialists of infectious diseases, this book is the one that you can buy and read."
1,Irresponsible,"As a music therapist, I found this book insulting. The music choices sited are simplistic and unresearched, and could hurt (in some cases) more than help. Just listening to ""The Sunny Side of the Street"" when you are depressed is not enough and can alienate and compound a problem. Music is an extremely powerful medium, and without understanding elements besides just tempo and lyrics it is impossible and irresponsible to give informed advice on ways to use it therapeutically."
2,Useless pop psychology,"Nothing in this book has any basis in psychology, neurology, musicology, or taoism. It's anecdotally-based self-help fluff, and the doctor who wrote it is either incompetent or is going for a cash-grab. Useless for anyone seeking real, meaningful change in their life; worse than useless for people who actually need help. For the former: when you're stressed, listen to relaxing music. When you're sad, listen to happy music. I just saved you $20. You're welcome. The latter will only be further alienated when they don't feel what they're ""supposed"" to feel listening to the author's minimally-considered ""music menus"". And for the emotionally-shallow people to whom this book is targeted, I'm sure there are cheaper placebos available."
5,Conne Boswell at her best...,"As far as jazz singing goes, this is as good as it gets. Connee Boswell really digs into these jazz standards, with her big New Orleans Southern drawl, and her innate sense of rhythm. Her phrasing a delight. BUY IT"
1,how sad,"w a lh - ea - ttor, in rebus speak, what a let downI have dipped in and out of Jakes web site for a couple of years now, and have always found teasers that are both challenging and funny. Regulars such as Mad_Ade, dumbell, mogmatt16, MrIxolite, Tissue, Datra16 (the list goes on), all have become almost real to me over time from reading their banter and reparte. The humour carried over into the tasers, although not all those who contribute do so with teasers.When I picked up this book I expected wit and humour in the brain teasers. Instead I found badly copied and poorly reconstructed immitations of what is found on line.I feel Jake has done those who have trusted him a great discredit.This one is going stright to the second hand shop. It is just a shame there is no option for no stars."
2,"Not for true ""geeks"" at all.","This is another book that implies it's for power users, yet most of what's in here can be found in any garden variety book on how to run Linux. Only part of this book is aimed at ""geeks"".The promotional text on the back cover implies that it's aimed at sysadmins. And while *some* of it is, most of it is stuff that a system administrator would already be familiar with.Much of what's in this book is the same stuff aimed at beginning to intermediate Linux desktop users. It's not for real ""geeks"" or sysadmins by any means.If only the truly useful stuff for sysadmins/geeks were included, the book would be 1/3 it's size.It's not that it's a bad book; it's just not marketed well at all and has a very misleading title.I found it a complete waste of money. It's hard to find books for ""intermediate to advanced"" users. I figured this would be one of them. It's not.I was quite disappointed."
3,Very Helpful,"This book will help you understand SmartSuite Mill. It does cover everthing from the very basics to the more advanced parts of SmartSuite Mill. The only problem with the book is that the author spent to much time covering the basics, and not the more complex parts of SmartSuite. But it is never the less an informative book."
1,Pricey User Manual,If you took out what was not directly related to the vastly overpriced costXpert product you would have about 10 pages.
5,The perfect gift,"This book is a must have for women and girls who have the horse ""bug"". It also makes a perfect gift for any one who loves horses. It is about love, determination and the natural and mysterious connections that women and girls have with their horses. The illustrations are gorgeous and perfectly depict the tender moments of growing up with a horse. A very special book."
5,Lovely/ordered the set but got one for the price of 12,"I ordered the set of 12 but only received one, I was charged for the set. I emailed Ross Simon but haven't heard anything yet. I'm sure I could give a better review if the Ross Simon responded to me."
2,What happened!!!,"I am still in shock over season 5 with the overtones on mafia homosexuality. Where they were going with that I have no idea. I need to talk to Dr. Malfi now. In mafia history never ever have storylines goneout in left field to this extreme. Season 6 was a reaching attempt to keep us ""ganster fans"" glued to the tube. And Tony's dreams... MINGA MIA I would have bought that whole dream sequence if he was on acid, crack, or magic mushrooms. Now OZ and Six feet under when out in style. I would have writen better story lines for these last two seasons. Well time to my prozac to get over the shame of a capo going down on the braciole."
2,disappointment,"this is the worst sopranos season. tony in a coma went on for too long without a reason, same goes with vito's story...i think they were trying too hard with this homosexuality thing. if they really wanted to do these two, they could've sumarized it in two episodes and move one with more important things which is something that is lacking in this season. If you cut all the fat and go straight to the point and to the real relevant stuff that happened, this season would've been 5 episodes to say the least. buying this is really not worth it, especially when its going to be released as part I and II. this is really something i didnt expect from this guys. anyway, if you really want to catch up with whats going on go to block buster or any other movie rental or wait for some re-runs."
3,Half a season for full price?,"What's up with half a season for a full season's price?Is it a new rip-off, like when Friends started coming on one-sided disks, and they almost double the price? (This was UK, I don't know how it went in the states.) (Now you can buy all ten seasons of Friends in nice compact boxes for a third of the price! Wish I'd known.)"
4,Items Ordered,"I ordered this product, exactly as advertised and the price was great. I also received it in the time that I expected and paid extra for. I have ordered from other sites and paid extra for a specific delivery and they did not come through. I would of liked to have known right away though who is delivering my package. I like to track them, so that I know more or less when to look for them."
2,"Welcome to ""Mafia goes arty""","As a German fan of the Sopranos from the very beginning I've ordered series six directly in the US. And was disappointed. Nothing new, stereotype actors, just another sequel to make money. If you like movies which are done ""the very slow way"" (nothing happens, but it looks very arty) than go for it. For all others: buy ""The Shield"" and be astonished that even Series 5 tops the the 4 predecessors, the stories never loose speed and the actors are actually evolving - in a credible way. 2 Stars because Tony still has his moments we love him for"
4,A great start to the season,"The bad news is that this is only part of season six, so the payoff to all the plot lines isn't there, and the set just sort of ... ends.The good news is that there's been a ton of great set-up for the end of the season and if the payoff is half as good as the set-up, season six, in its entirety, will definitely be a series high water mark.And it's not that there aren't great stories told in this half of the season, either. In particular, Vito finally takes center stage and the Soprano family's relationship with the New York mob takes several violent twists.As an incomplete season, this DVD set is unsatisfying in that so many plot threads are left dangling. If this is the kind of thing that will bother you (it seems to bother a lot of people), wait on the next DVD set being released before picking this up."
5,Great Series,Sopranos is one of the great Tv series of all time. Pick up some canoli and red wine and clear out a weekend for some great viewing.
3,Spinning their Wheels,"This is probably the most dispensable of the Sopranos seasons. At the time, the show was intended to run several fewer seasons but HBO was dangling serious money in front of the creative team to extend the show. Chase should have turned them down. Instead, he indulged his most pretentious inclinations with a multi-episode dream sequence that amounts to a lot of cliches about the afterlife and the nature of identity. This is followed by the Vito is gay storyline which could have been a fascinating exploration of a hot-button issue. Unfortunately, the actor who plays Vito just can't carry it off. Chris trying to start a Saw-clone franchise is among the also-ran sub-plots of this season."
2,Slow and boring,"I thought that these season was terribly slow and boring. It was definitely not worth buying new for US$70! But as a Sopranos fan, I grit and bear each episode in hopes that it would get better. It didn't."
4,Not Bad At All...,"I was a little concerned reading the reviews for the latest season of the Sopranos here... many of them were very negative. However upon actually viewing it myself my fears were relieved. While this is certainly not the best season in the series it is overall still great! I watched the whole thing in two days (as quick as I ever watched any of the other seasons). The season did seem to be lacking a little... something. But perhaps when Part 2 is finally released that missing ""something"" will arrive. In any case if you enjoyed the first five seasons there is no reason why you won't like this one."
3,Misunderstanding,Unfortunately we couldn't see this DVD because we are in Europe (Spain) and it seems it's only ready to watch for America.I recomended you should warn the customers about thatI expect some explanation from your sidethanksregardsJoan Bove
1,MORE COMSUMER GAUGING - NOW BY HBO!,"Let me begin by saying that I love ""The Sopranos"" series and have watched it religiously since the begininng. I have all 5 seasons on DVD and was anxiously waitng for Season 6 to be released but to charge so much money for half-of-a-season is totally unacceptable!!First the Gasoline Companies rape the public out of I don't know how many millions of dollars and now HBO is doing the same!!! And then they wonder why so many people pirate/copy their products!!! I will not purchase this product, I'll be waiting to borrow it from someone else or rent it. I missed a couple of episodes last year because of transitioning but if what I saw (Like 8 episopdes) was any indication - SEASON SIX BLOWS! (or should I say the first half of Season Six bLOWS!)"
1,Junk TV,"Soprano's-The Ultimate in Trash TV!It is no wonder there are so many sick minds in the World today.Why do we take so much enjoyment out of misery, stupidity, and individuals abusing everyone else!This is not entertainment, I am more than happy to see it finally clear our Netflix list. My friend likes it--- and-remember mysery loves company!!! so maybe that explains all!Someday we will all wake up and fire anyone who cannot create better television or movies etc., than this.Including the actors!!Six seasons amazing, it didn't deserve even 1!"
1,"Not impressed, no improvement over dvd version","First off: season gets FIVE starsI own a PS3 (blu-ray) and a 46"" Samsung 120hz 1080p set.I own seasons 1-5 on DVD, and all of season 6 on Blu-ray.To be honest, there is no improvement over the dvd version of the set. Seasons 1-5 (DVD) look exactly the same as season 6 (blu-ray).Also, there is no reason why this season could not be on 3 blu-ray discs. I own other shows on blu-ray, and the ENTIRE **SEASON** is on ONE disc. FYI, you can fit SIX HD one hour shows on blu-ray (see Weeds on blu-ray, 12+ episodes in 1080p (30mins) on ONE disc))I love the show, but no one should waste money on the blu-ray set with no improvement in quality. (Luckily, I purchased season 6 on blu-ray cheaper than the dvd version)"
4,"THIS IS STILL A GREAT SHOW,BUT ALL GOOD THINGS COME TO AN END","This is another very good installment in the series. I do think the show is running out of steam a little. I enjoy it,but I think it is a wise decision to end this series while it still good. I hope the last episodes live up to the rest of the series. The DVD transfer is good in this set."
4,more TV series on blu Ray please!,Good series finally on Blu Ray. hopefully theres more to come soon.I appreciate the Sopranos Series. I hope theres more to come.I Want the Complete Series on Blu Ray..... PLEASEPicture Quality very good for a TV series the series has severeal critics mostly positive I can underline the positive recomentations.
4,End of Sopranos,"The Sopranos series was great, except for this one! Did not like the ending. Maybe another 'tv movie' should be made with the characters getting what they deserve."
4,A must for Sopranos Fans,Not one of the best season's but a must for collectors of the Sopranos series.
2,A lot of worthless filler,"Wow, where to start. This is by far the weakest season of The Saprano's by far. Tony's coma/dream episodes went on much to long. The whole Vito storyline, I'm sorry, did nothing to further the series. Carm's trip to Paris, more filler. It's just what most of the episodes felt like. Maybe the whole 20 episode season was just to much.This has been one of the best shows ever produced for T.V., certainly the best show in years. This first part of the last season just seemed to be one big waste of time. I won't be wasting my money on it. So little happens that it will hardly missed."
3,Why just Part 1?,"Of course, I haven't seen this DVD yet, but WHY Part 1 only? ALL of the previous seasons have included 13 episodes, so why stop at 12? Does this mean that Part 2 will be ONE episode? If it's going to be MORE than that, why not just call it Season 7?This set has a hefty price for only 4 discs, although I'm sure this has to do with demand for the DVD (aka taking advantage of a thirsty public), as well as the quality of the program. Let's hope we aren't being duped again.Will I buy it? Probably. Will I be upset if it later comes out as a COMPLETE season 6 for a more reasonable price? DEFINITELY!!!"
1,disastrous!,"seasons 1 through 5 were phenomenal. this season seems like it was written by not-very-talented high schoolers. not one character rings true. each episode is worse than the one before. if you love the sopranos, skip season 6."
5,Very Positive - International Shipping Very Quick!,"I would use this company again and again for future purchases, The shipment came much quicker than expected, considering that I am from Germany.Condition of the used DVD was excellent!"
5,Still The Sopranos (Spoiler Alert),Although this season has been bashed by many it's still the best show on all of television. I think it's just perception and expectations. People have in their mind what should happen and when it doesn't happen that way they are upset. I just sit back and enjoy the show as I always have. I believe there were actually only 3 Soprano crime family members killed not 4. The other major killings were of New York faction.
4,Good as it Gets -- Almost.,"The Sopranos - Season Six comes reasonably close to keeping the ball in the air, not an easy exercise given the early burn out nature of the exercise. The problem this time around, if there is one, is that while the curve of excellence peaks beautifully at both ends of the season, it seems to go flatter than usual in the middle.How flat? Flat enough to make any viewer with a keen production eye guess that one or two of the mid-season episodes might have been strung together using sequences scripted and shot with other possible uses in mind. Maybe its creators were counting on 'The Sopranos style' to knit these random elements into a whole. Who knows! Perhaps for all but the most ardent of viewers, those looking for each episode to further thicken an already ample mix, maybe they succeeded swimmingly."
2,"NOt Bad, but there's better",I think there is some pretty good material here but for the price there is definitely better videos. Ginastica Natural is the best. You will see movements on both videos but Ginastica natural has been around much longer and has developed a better routine in my opinion.
4,a pain to install but work well,these are difficult to install but work great once you get them lined up properly
3,"Functionally sufficient, but aesthetically deficient","I ordered these about a month ago. They certainly get the job done, but I must say -- they leave TOO much to the imagination. I ended up deciding to use the abalone-encrusted diamond-studded lift-off hinges from Penn-Elcom's main competitor, because they understand the importance of aesthetics in an industrial application. For shame."
1,"Don't waste the money, read Cisco's press releases instead","Truly a puff piece. The authors don't acknowledge any of the major challenges facing Cisco or give any sort of balanced review of the company. Cisco and technological innovation are about as far apart as they are at Microsoft. It's just a marketing machine, pure and simple."
2,Agree; Puff Piece,"I agree with the reviewer who called this a puff piece. Cisco has feet of clay in the internet telephony, voice-video-data over IP and fiber optic internet connection spaces. They are especially out of it in internet telephony and fiber optics. Further, valuation in ""Cisco dollars"" is a problem soon to be shared by many ""New Age""companies; specifically, extreme valuation supported more by hopes and wishes than anything truly tangible. Personally, I would bet on Nortel Networks. Lucent and the others are also rans and disqualified by the Jack Welch 1st., 2nd. or not at all philosophy."
1,"Sloppy, poorly written, and content-light","Perhaps I'm echoing a lot of the other comments here, but this book is severely disappointing. It appears to have been written by someone who is both a poor writer and who has very little understanding of networking or the infrastructure industry. There are no crisp descriptions of what Cisco does, how its products work, or how its strategy has evolved. Instead, there are glib, useless platitudes and a lot of fluff. Complete waste of time."
2,Just an image control piece.,"As a ten year veteran of cisco, I am discouraged by the misinformation presented in this book. Many omissions, factual errors, incorrect attributions are present in this book. Very few of the mistakes cisco made along the way are documented and discussed. Mistakes that lead to the formation of companies that now successfully compete against cisco like Juniper Networks. Or near misses like almost giving our source code to Microsoft. Cisco has an amazing story to tell, I am sadden to see this puff piece instead. I look fondly on most of my association with cisco, but this book does not accurately document the company and its inter-workings, it only demonstrates that cisco has one of the best image control infrastructures around."
5,amazingly original metal,"With the release of Nothingface Voivod left their harsher tones and rhythms displayed on such albums as Killing Technology or their debut album War and Pain for a more experimental sound. From the very cool intro you know you're in for someting special. the music is dark and dissonant ; the lyrics and themes of the songs deal with very ""out there"" science fiction. The first time I heard this album I was amazed and captivated by this unique sound and vision. has been hugely influential to me ."
1,These Smarties are Dumb,Let me begin with there is nothing wrong with the candy--just the price. It is not specified in the description but these are the mini smarties rolls. Most smarties contain 15 candies per rolls. These contain only 10. A box count of 120 (of the 15 candies/roll) can be obtained for half this price from other non-Amazon vendors. I should have done my homework. Most expensive smarties I ever ate.
4,Perfect for the Price,This is a good price on a basic coffee tumbler mug. The coloring on the picture matches the actual tumbler pretty well. Good size and can be easily held. Fits nicely in the car drink holders as well.
4,"Intruiging, different, and varied views on memory","This book differs from the standard theoretical texts on the psychology of memory. It offers a view of the role of memory in a variety of contexts, thus looking at its subject from many perspectives. I think the book offers an excellent companion text to a course on theories of memory. In addition, it may be of interest to the lay reader as well, because of its emphasis on practical aspects of memory, and because of of its clarification of many phenomena that give memories a mystical air. If you're interested in a thought-provoking psychology text, this is a book to go for."
3,Middling 70s Top album,"""Tejas"" opens with the great single ""Its Only Love,"" then segues into the grungy ""Arrested for Driving While Blind."" Then it shifts into a lower gear for awhile before reemerging a couple of times in the second half with the rocking ""Ten Dollar Man,"" and the supremely catchy ""She's a Heartbreaker."" The filler in between is blander. All in all, not among ZZ Top's best albums, but still worthwhile for anyone who enjoys the music of the little ol' band from Texas. As for the harping about the changes made from album to CD, I've owned both and do not find them to be as dramatic (or tragic) as other reviews make them out to be."
1,Pure crap,I listened to this album on tape and LP for 20 years when I finally decided to pick up a CD.Oh my god....the CD is pure crap. It sounds like it was played under a pillow and the drums were replaced by a cheap drum machine.Please whoever is in charge of such things fix this crap and put the original recording on CD.This is one of my favorite albums of all time and the Cd release is one of the worst of all time.
1,Remix Disaster,"This was my favorite album back in the days of cassette tapes. I wish I still had the tape. It would be better than the remixed garbage put out on CD. Why would anybody want to take a perfectly good drum track and make it sound like a casio drum machine on PURPOSE? The original Tejas was one of those rare albums where EVERY song was good and the sequence was perfect. I'd never get sick of listening over and over to this album. But three seconds into ""It's only love"" on the remix and I'm sick to death.I bought the vinyl album from Ebay. It's wonderful. I was thinking that it's so common for good artists to go commercial and destroy the beauty of their art for the sake of a buck. But in the case of ZZTOP they even went back and ruined the really good stuff they made before they went commercial."
1,Another Re-Mix Bash,"Ok, I will go ahead and say it again. This is a really great album but the remix on it is AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good Lord, someone got these guys to fix ""Tres Hombres"" and ""Fandango"" already and they sound incredible but WHY WON'T THEY FIX ""Tejas"", ""Rio Grande Mud"" and ""ZZ Top's First Album"" as well???? I am literally going out of my way to get these albums on vinyl so I can turn them to MP3's so I can get the sound of these albums as they were originally intended to sound. I'm usually not too anal about remixes but these are downright un-listenable. The songs are great but this needs fixed. Who else is with me?"
1,Do not buy this CD,"I should have carefully checked the reviews beforehand. I don't normally do because I like to form my own opinions but in this case I would have saved money and would not have been disapointed.I'm a great fan of ZZ TOP and I wanted to complete my collection by adding their very earlier stuff like ZZTop's first album, Rio Grande Mud and Tejas...what a disappointment!!! Who's the brilliant person that switched the drums with electronic drums or a drum machine??? Man-o-man what a mistake to have screwed up such classics as these. What a waste, can I return my purchase? Good job Bill Ham...wow an engineer!!"
1,GEEEEEZ!,WHEN IS THIS GETTING REISSUED IN IT'S ORIGINAL MIX?!! WHAT THE HELL IS TAKING SO LONG? THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEIR TOP 5 ALBUMS EVER AND IT'S STILL ONLY AVAILABLE AS THIS HORRIBLE 90'S REMIX PIECE OF SHEEEET! HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET THIS REISSUED? IT SEEMS TO BE LONG AFTER WE'RE ALL DEAD. WHAT A CRYIN' SHAME. KILLER ANALOG ALBUM DESTROYED BY DIGITAL NITWITS.
1,5 STARS REDUCED TO 1 FOR AN AWFUL REMIX,"This is ZZ Tops best album.I loved this on vinyl for over 20 years.When I finally got rid of my record collection I bought this on CD and the remix,particularly the drum parts make me ill.Another problem on my copy which I haven't heard anyone else mention is that the first two words of""arrested for driving while blind""are missing as if they were omitted.It has been so unpleasant not being able to listen to one of my all time favorite albums as much as I would like."
3,A great original drummed into the ground,"I was just as disappointed and appalled as other reviewers with the re-mixing of this great album for the CD version. I actually bought the ZZ Top Six-Pack CD, which includes their first 6 recordings, all of which were re-mixed with a 1980's drum sound. I went to Amazon in search of the individual Tejas CD, hoping I would find that it was cut from the original. Thanks to all of the reviewers that saved me from buying another version of the crappy recording that I already own. Your opinions are right on-- this CD, as all of the ones on the Six-Pack, needs to be re-cut using the ORIGINAL mix. Then I would rate it with 5 Stars."
1,Drum Tracks Ruin Previously Great Album,"When this album was remastered, the original drum tracks were altered to coincide with the band's more recent sound on albums like Eliminator, etc. What a tragedy! This was a great album and should be reissued in its original form. I am only grateful I still have a turntable and can play the original. I threw the cd out. I could not get past the altered drum tracks. I cannot believe the band chose to ""revise"" the album. I hope that it is eventually put out on cd as it was originally meant to be heard. Nothing on the packaging even warns you that it is not in the original form. Dishonest and disappointing is all I can say."
4,In Short...,"In Short, Tejas was my favorite zz album for many years, and still is. ""Album"" is the key word here. An amazing album full of great songs with plenty of raw feelings. The CD, however, is horribly mixed, overproduced, and sounds like it was EQ'd in a tiled shower. A perfect example of technology trying to fix something that wasn't broken. If you've never heard the vinyl version, you'll more than likely enjoy the cd. I'll just have to stock up on turntable stylus' until they decide to do this right."
5,Best Album I've Ever Listened to Without Having a Radio Hit on it,"I first bought this album in vinyl in the late 70s and wore it out. I recently was scanning through some ZZ Top work and sampled some songs of Tejas and had to buy it again. This album didn't have any hits, but it contains some very good music. If you don't have Tejas in your ZZ Top collection, buy it...you'll luv it!!"
5,My favorite ZZ TOP record (sans bad eighties mix),"Maybe it's b/c Ive never heard these songs on the radio and none of them are hits but this is my favorite, hands down. Maybe it's the country twang ?In my opinion, the best song is ''Pan Am Highway Blues'' but all the songs are standouts among their catalog, with the exception of '' Snappy Kakkie''"
5,New MP3 Release of Tejas Sounds Like Original Vinal?,"High rating is only for the new MP3 version!!! I just listened to the MP3 soudbites for Tejas (released April 2012). I have not heard the full recordings yet, but they sound like the original drumset from the vinal record! Yea! Many years ago, I owned and lost the original vinal, then recently re-purchased the CD with the digital drum overdubs. The CD with the overdubs is horrible to listen to. These MP3s seem to have the original drum kit instead of the overdubs. I'm glad to see someone listened to our need for the original recording, but I will wait to purchase revision on CD IF it is released."
3,Could Provide More In-Depth Info,"Though this book does discuss character emotions, it does so with seemingly as little depth as possible. Not to say that the book is no good; it is an interesting read & helpful as well. However, I believe more depth is necessary in creating character emotions than this book provides."
3,Short but good,"This book makes a good attempt at explaining how to convey the emotions of ones characters. As an Augsberger, however, I need a little more assistence than this lent."
1,too simplistic / bad method to grasp character feelings,I threw this book away. I could not stoop to give it away. It falls far short of understanding charater emotions let alone as an aid to help writing any. I wondered that anyone could write a book on this subject. Examples in context might help if they were elaborated to get a feel for the way they work. Perhaps a contrast with the difficulties of life and facing heartrending needs of our being. I think we must seek to understand our humanity. Step out of your security and comfort zone. Emotions hang on the unknown and fear and passions. After all the purpose is to create feelings. I don't think you learn something from reading bad examples. I can contrast anything I write or citations I use as good when compared with bad. It is called using a straw dog. You must know the true and study it in order to grasp emotions. A little pain and compassion helps too.
3,Worth reading once,"This book does an adequate job of cataloguing the numerous feelings a writer might write into his or her characters. Think of this as an emotional reference book for the writer, not a menu of emotions to employ in your work.I found this book valuable for a handful of reasons, notably the author's ""good example"" sections, which contained contributions from notable authors from a wide literary basis. These collected ""good examples"" help the reader identify exemplary manifestations of emotion.However, in some cases her ""bad examples"" seemed repetitive and simplistic. In other cases the examples didn't seem so bad in my opinion (i.e. in a certain context, the text would be perfectly acceptable).In the end, her advice on trying to write emotions freshly and from new perspectives is a useful reminder, making the book a worthwhile read."
4,Wish It Could Have Been Expanded to Other Emotions,"Slightly limited. What emotions it does cover, it does well. I wish it could tie them all together, perhaps for mixed emotions or conflicted emotions. And then there were some emotions not included in the book at all. I've used it dozens of times. So it is well worth the money."
3,Good emotions one at a time,"Ann Hood did a great job. pick any emotion you need, and read how to develop it. 36, emotions targeted in independent chapters. This is a super reference book for any writer. Sooner or later, every writer will need this book, or one like it. This kind of research, will prevent flat characters."
4,THIS CD IS WHAT MY HUSBAND WANTED,"MY HUSBAND IS THE BIGGEST ELVIS PRESTLEY FAN.. HE ALMOST GOT ALL OF HIS CDS. THIS CAME QUICKLY, VERY WELL WRAPPED, CAME AS DESCRIBED, ALSO CAME BEFORE THE ACTUAL DATE. THANK YOU. WOULD BUY FROM YOU AGAIN"
1,Nice Try,"One of the worst zombie films made. As is so often the case with ""no budget"" films, the film makers had some good ideas, but not enough money to pull them off. Might be real instructive for aspiring film makers. I did not hate it, but don't predict you won't."
4,Good Collection of Mancini Hits,"I first heard this collection about 25 years ago on cassette that my cousin loaned to me. I have always liked the newer version of ""Peter Gunn"" which features a funky guitar opening leading into the main melody. If you are searching for the original version, you won't find it here. However, there are other collections of Mancini's music that feature the original ""Peter Gunn"" which is also a favorite of mine. All in all, it is a good arrangement of songs (Mr. Lucky, Pink Panther theme, etc.) for anyone looking for a comprehensive CD of Henry Mancini."
3,Creative Zen Leather case,"The case fits my Zen plus perfectly. It has a cutouts for the power button, the volume control and the joystick. I wish I'd of known there wasn't a cutout for the play\pause and back\options buttons. I have to press them through the leather or pull it out the case. Otherwise it's nice, it has a vinyl window that protects the screen."
1,Can't recommend,Very cheap. Pay a few extra dollars for a good tube. So cheap I didn't bother to contact the seller for a return. The main problem is the quality of the stem. My pump could barely stay attached because it is smooth. The tube threading was missing so the cap would not stay on.
5,Pat your ownself on the back,"This cd is so befitting for a time such as this. If your going to survive you must encourage yourself. You will find many times that it's just you and JESUS. I played this song until it got into my spirit, now it's not just a song but a true inspiration."
5,Tri City Singers,Wonderful CD Tri City Singers farewell concert live in Atlanta.It is inspirational and foot tapping. Recommend any of their work.
2,Stains easily and not waterproof,"Used it last winter. Since it is light color, it doesn't hide dirt very well, at the end of winter, I saw specks of black stains on the cover (could it be mildew?) I didn't bother to wash them off and just stored it in my crawl space for the summer season.I just pulled it out yesterday to cover my patio table and the mildew(?) did not get worse nor better. I still used it, but just a bit annoyed by the ease of attracting dirt.Also, it is not waterproof, when I pulled the cover off the table at the end of last winter, I saw a pool of water on my tabletop."
4,nice,this album is a well put together album. i was shocked that the cd has two songs u can step to. the only bad spot is that the album seems a lil short. other than that the album does not sound like a trditional south cd. it has combination between south and east coast its a nice mix.
2,what?!?!?!?!?!,"When I found out Yung Wun was signed to Swizz Beatz label Full Surface, i couldn't wait for the album to hit stores. I've been waiting since May, and FINALLY it dropped.Yung Wun tore up the Ruff Ryder volume 2 album w/ 3 classic tracks on there. then droped some bars on ""Some South S***"" from Volume 3. After hearing all this, i heard his debut single "" Tear it Up"". the song was crazy! When i saw the album was finally droppin, i HAD to buy it. I did right after school. So i put the album into cd player and expected fire. SUCKS! hardly any swizz producing, only 4 bangers, at most. I tried to tell ya, tear it up, yung wun anthem, and cadillac doors are the only good tracks. save your money, dont buy it, download tear it up. HOLLA"
5,Paradise!,"The recipes seemed easy enough to follow(can't wait to make more of them) and the book is quite beautiful..also, everything sounds delicious and takes me back to the Islands!"
3,Simple 35mm film camera,"Kodak KE25 EZ Load 35mm CameraThis camera proved easy to use and load. On a recent trip to West VA, I visited the Greenbank Radiotelescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. I was the only one in my group who could take pictures, because digital cameras or film cameras with advanced electronics were not allowed as they would interfere with the telescope. In other words, such basic cameras still have their uses!I was able to purchase this camera at amazon.com after several attempts to purchase a film camera in stores failed."
3,Disappointing but still very informative,"If you've read the four volumes in the series before this one,you will find The Revolution against Christendom a bit disappointing. Warren Carroll says he was already ill at the time of the book's writing (he passed away mid 2011) and it shows. Missing are his asides, commentaries, analyses and insights related to doctrinal issues. The book reads more like a chronicle of events or research paper. That is both its strength and its weakness. Still, given its enormous bibliography, the book is still an excellent reference unless you have access to all the books he referred to. I still look forward to the sixth and seventh volumes originally planned for the series."
1,Very Disappointing,"This is the fifth volume in Mr. Caroll's series on the history of Christendom; and I have read them all. It really saddens me to not recommend this book after enjoying the first three volumes, but I should have realized something was up when I was reading the fourth and began to wonder if I was reading an original text or just a collection of quotes. The unfortunate stroke suffered by Mr. Caroll apparently played a large part in the sudden downturn in the quality of his manuscripts. I would attribute no more than 25% of this book as original literature, with the remainder being extensive quotes from other authors and direct lifts (entire chapters) from his previous work, ""The Guillotine and the Cross."" As it is this final volume, which should have been the crowning achievement of Mr. Caroll's life long work, in no way serves as a viable history of Christendom during this period. I regret that it would have been better if it had gone unwritten."
5,Easy to Change,"OK, so it's a die head. Big whoop, there isn't anything special about it is there? Actually, there is. It is easy to switch with other heads into a threader, and it is made by Ridgid, so it is the best die head on the market!"
5,USA Made Set,Nice set for the price. branded for northern Tools. Bottom of case states HUOT and the bits are HHS stampled U.S.A. Bits have a nice coating of oil to prevent rust.
5,Very Inciteful,As a busy manager this book was a great find. Very practical and clever instruction in influence techniques that I have used successfully in many different contexts. A real individualistic picture of my influence patterns and tips on how to use them effectively. Highly recomended
3,Be Understood or Be Overlooked,"My profile was so accurate and explained much of my influence and communication difficulties. Using the book, I was able to improve my understanding significantly."
1,pretty much a waste of money,"Rarely have I got so little from a book like this. The entire contents of this book could have been written on a double sided sheet of paper. It is patronising, drawn out and overly politically correct. Very disappointing read. This might be relevant for someone who works in a very junior role in the public service but is of no value for middle or senior management in any kind of modern organisation. I actually laughed at loud whilst reading a lot of what it purports to present as advice."
2,Don't go with the new...,"If you have a choice between ""old school"" industrial/electronic, and this album... GO WITH THE FORMER!Made the mistake of purchasing this over Abscess' ""in your mind"", and it was a complete waste...There are about 4 full good songs on this album, and most of the music is good, but it tends to go bad with the lyrics and vocals."
4,Andy rocks,"Not as good as combichrist and some of the songs are hit & miss but the good songs such as: pure tension, panzer, its all in your head, and especially when death embrace me make this a album worth purchasing"
1,Return to the Shelf,"This book is not worth the time of anyone serious about history and biblical exegesis. The historical research is shotty and the biblical exegesis is horrible, even offensive in places. As a Christian Bible student and an African-American, I can confidently and credibly say the Bible speaks nothing, I repeat, nothing of the return to glory of African-Americans. It speaks clearly and overwhelming of the Return of Christ in Glory. I don't advocate the burning of books. Just return this one to the shelf and see if it might spontaneously combust. Hopefully."
2,no real stirring here,"A bit disappointed, maybe because I'm a grown up...The first half of the book is a bit informative and interesting, but I waited for more historical facts, and not an analysis of the holy scriptures. I live in Europe where people don't read the Bible as if it was history. We consider it more metaphorical. So if the authors are really heading towards glory, this is not the way for our black youth here in France. The second half of the book appears useless. I think it's just there to show that some white folks care. It doesn't really help."
2,"Not another spineless Harlequin heroine, please!","This story is exceedingly silly - BUT, it might have been a good read, if only the heroine hadn't given up her house, her job and her spine, just to marry the man who fathered her biological daughter. (She's got HIS biological child, due to a mix-up in the IVF clinic.) I could have accepted the marriage of convenience, so that they can each be close to their biological child (and there's the convenient fact that they are both madly attracted to each other). But the spineless and helpless heroine who dumps everything to do what the hero tells her, really annoyed me. The hero is not much to write home about either - he's a stiff, and too controlling, taking over the heroine too much (but then, she allows it.)If the author had only written stronger, more attractive characters, and given the reader a more reasonable give-n-take between them, this would have been a good quick romantic read. As it is, it's pretty poor."
5,YOU'LL HOLD ONTO THIS BOOK TO READ AGAIN,"Wow! A heroine who really can take care of herself and doesn't need a hero to rescue her. But take heart, ET works our hero into the story and all is well. Another original plot. Another prologue that grabs you. Good secondary characters. Another great one from ET. If you haven't read her books, you will be thrilled with all of them."
3,Average,"The plot of this book had great potential, but in my opinion it was never fully realized. The characters where well developed and the writing was good, but the story just never grabbed my attention. It actually took me a few days to finish this book and that is very unusual for me. I would still recommend reading it, just don't expect too much."
5,Great Christmas Music,Just GreatThis album of Christmas music is a work of art. It is just great.This brought back memories from years ago when I first bought this album on vinyl.
2,Not worth the effort,I just love Christmas music and I love Mancini's Pink Panther and others. I thought this might be a good addition to my collection and it turned out to be a dud. Nothing special at all.
5,Mancini is Magical,"I come from a very large family and since the mid-sixties when my parents bought it we'd play this album during the holidays. We played it until you could hardly hear some of the songs without the crackling and skipping the LP's were notorious for. By the time it was totally inaudible the LP wasn't being made any longer. We were all crushed because our Christmas mainstay album was gone. (Particularly because we lost both parents some years ago within 2 months of each other and we always listened as a family to this album.) When the CD came out we were overjoyed to say the least. I ALWAYS cry as do all of us in my family when ""Carol for Another Christmas"" plays because it holds such dear memories of my parents listening to us massacre that song on our instruments EVERY SINGLE CHRISTMAS!!! But they always swore we played beautifully."
5,The Best Christmas Memories,"To me, this album represents one the best part of Christmas - Childhood. Although most of the songs are very familiar, the arrangements, even when I was a young girl, stayed in my mind as special. The track ""Carol For Another Christmas"" was so beautiful and opened our fresh minds to the idea that the birth of Jesus meant different things to different cultures. I remember we danced a clumsy ballet to it, thinking that we were as good as any professional. My whole family knows every nuance to this album and I'm looking so forward to seeing their faces when they unwrap this present from us."
3,Techno Grease!,"Definitely a must-have for any who loves bad musical theatre. Debbie Gibson is Sandy (pre-Deborah) and hits her ever-popular shrill high note at the end of ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" once the techno drums kick in for her big finish. Be prepared for plenty of sythesized instruments and some questionable ""American"" accents."
4,Best book for a non-baseball fan wanting to learn baseball,"I am a baseball fan, a huge fan, but my wife, however is not. I bought this book for my wife, in hopes of it prompting her to watch a few games with me next year. I thought there was nothing this book could teach me that I don't already know about the game. Boy, was I wrong. The author, M.S. White, has done an extraordinary job of starting out with the basics of the game and building it up to a simulated game experience in which the reader will see all they have learned ""put into play.""The straightforward writing and light-hearted humor throughout the book is refreshing, and the knowledge you learn about baseball is rewarding.A must read for anyone who love or hates baseball, from the all-star fan to the Bush League rookie."
2,Watch out if your reader still believes!,"I have the original Felix book plus the one about time, and was eagerly anticipating reading Felix's Christmas Around the World to my four-year-old. However, I had to heavily edit the first half of the book. The main character talks at school about believing in Santa and is laughed at by all the other children. The book goes on for pages about her feeling terrible for believing in Santa. If I had read it verbatim I think I would have ruined Santa for my daughter. This plot point wasn't necessary in order to present the rest of the information in the book. Yes, the pictures are lovely, the real letters from Felix are a delight, and the facts about Christmas in other lands are fascinating. But you can get the same quality in other Felix books. If your child believes in Santa, avoid this book for now."
3,Review Felix,"I was pleased with the service, but unhappy with the product. This book has 7 letters inside the book from Felix....three letters were missing...very disappointing!"
5,Very Happy,I was very happy with the Felix book. It came earlier than promised and was in great shape.
4,The best so far in the series!!!,"ALthough a fan of Nora Roberts, I had avoided these books due to a dislike for romance writer's sci fi, however, I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised. Should have trusted Nora's writing ability. This book is by far the best of the series that I've read so far. It is in the style of Dame Christie, and if you love her work you'll enjoy this futuristic take on the genre. One caveat, Nora or her publishers should really take the time to put in the front cover or on the back of the book a spoiler warning as this book gives away the ending to Witness for the Prosecution and Murder on the Orient Express. Yes these stories are famous and a lot of people have read them, but not everybody. Be coureous to those young readers who might read Robb before Christie and have two great stories spoiled."
5,Love it!!,"Another great one. Of course, the In Death series, as a whole, is one of the best I've ever read!!"
4,Witness in Death,These books are always so interesting. I am just so bad at reviewing books on amazon I can't remember the difference between this one and the last one I read. I know I loved it but I don't remember it well.
4,Fun to read,Series is interesting and fun to read. The characters keep me coming back. Can't wait to read the next one.
5,Vintage J.D. Robb with some Agatha Christie thrown in.,"Once again, J. D. Robb manages to pull a superb thriller out of her hat. This is obviously a tribute to Dame Agatha Christie. As a Christie-lover, the various references to her work made me smile throughout the book.With a cameo appearance from Mavis, the reappearance of both Charles Monroe and Officer Truehart, and the continually building relationships, now between Peabody and McNab as well as Eve and Roarke, as well as some interesting twists here and there, this book is definitely an excellent read, with a very satisfying - and surprising - ending. I hope Ms. Robb continues to delve into Eve's and Roarke's pasts, especially since she handles it with such sensitivity.I'm only sorry we have to wait to read ""Judgement in Death."" The scene with Eve and the baby was absolutely priceless."
4,Pretty good - but not my favorite,"Let me start by saying that I love the ""In Death"" series and Nora Roberts is the best. However, this book has been my least favorite so far in this series. I found it a little slow moving at times, and thought the ending was a bit anticlimactic.That being said, I still enjoyed the book and believe that you can never go wrong picking up a Nora Roberts book!"
4,Eve and Roarke's Relationship Grows,This case begins when one actor sticks a knife into another on stage and kills him. Roarke is bringing back a play by Agatha Christie and Eve has to investigate the tangled relationships between all of the actors. This one incorporates mothers in many ways and gets both Roarke and Eve thinking about theirs. Peabody and McNab are in a relationship and Trueheart becomes part of Eve's team.
5,Witnes in Death Review,"I'm reading the whole ""in Death"" series and I'm really enjoying it. Eve Dallas is really a hard working copy who loves her job for all the right reasons. Excellent books."
3,Moves slow but she pulls through in the end.,"I love Nora Robberts as herself but also as JD Robb. This book was a little slow at first but picked up speed about 50-75% of the way through. There were a plethora of characters and i found myself referring back in the book to keep them all straight. Overall, okay read. Worth it as a building block in following the lives of Eve and Roarke."
1,"Abysmal writing, stupid story","It's tempting to sue the publishers for mental anguish. Cartoon characters, and an unlikable protagonist, make a dumb plot dumber. And what is the future-setting in aid of? It commits many minuses, and adds no pluses. My guess is it's pure laziness, so that the author doesn't have to know anything about her topics and can blame anomalies on ""things will have changed by then."" And speaking of change, her notions of where we'll be by then are worthy of deep derision."
3,"Fun as Usual, But That Spoiler...!","At some point, i'll probably get around to writing a longer and more comprehensive review of this book -- i hope top review the whole series eventually -- but i have got to say one thing here.How could she?This book, with no warning at all, begins with a total spoiler for a famous mystery novel/play!While the work in question, one of Dame Agatha's neat little thrillers [not ""The Mousetrap"" or ""Ten Little [Whatevers]"", though), can arguably be said to have been around long enough that most people who might be interested will know the ending, i still couldn't believe my eyes as i read the first chapter of this book.Foul!What if i wrote reviews giving away the endings of the other ""in Death"" books, on the theory that they've been out for a while and anyone who cares will know the endings?"
3,Unpleasant,"in her manner with others, Detective Dallas barely has time to solve mysteries since she is constantly engaging in sexual activity. If you like romance novels you may enjoy Robb. If you enjoy pure mystery or police procedurals, you probably won't."
1,I wish I knew what the rest of you see in this!,"My husband read about 200 pages and quit and I'm at about 100 pages and that's it. Maybe we shouldn't have started so late in the series but I can't imagine wanting to read any others. There's nothing attractive about Eve Dallas and I can't imagine what her gorgeous, billionaire, great in bed husband sees in her (isn't he just what ALL women want?). Their romance is as realistic as a Danielle Steele novel. The mystery is not compelling. Who cares if this jerk was murdered? And it is truly poorly written! I'd give it 0 stars if I could!"
5,ANOTHER WINNER!,"I have read all of the J.D. Robb books, & have enjoyed this one the most. Character development, themes within themes, & a harder to solve mystery make this book the best in her series so far. I agree with other readers, it is always hard to wait for the next one. Keep them coming, please!"
5,compelling and must have read!,"Great spot to start and then start from the beginning to know the characters and just an amazin storyline to get hooked on, I've read and read them over..."
5,Great book,"A wonderful addition to the ""In Death"" series, and a wonderful tip-of-the-hat to Dame Agatha Christie!"
4,High School Musical Board Game,The board game provides a dance tutorial for the kids to practice. It is a must that you have the movie in addition to the board game as much of the trivia questions come from scenes in the movie. My kids love this game.
3,Too hard,"If you are a serious HSM fan then this is a great game for you. Otherwise its just too hard. I bought it to use at my daughter's birthday party and we didn't even use it because I knew they would get too frustrated, especially on the dance step questions."
3,fun,"My daughter had a lot of fun with this game, for 2 weeks. Then she lost interest in it, if I'd known how quickly it would fall out of favor I wouldn't have bought it. The game itself is fine but limited in scope, on top of that it was based on a fad which I thought would last a bit longer than it did (with my daughter). I would only recommend this game for die-hard HSM fans. If you have a video game console, I recommend Disney Sing It! instead as it has the HSM songs and other Disney channel stars' songs as well."
3,Good for Little Kids,"Is a great toy for little kids between 6-10 yrs that have seen the movie many times, for the older ones it becomes boring, my 6 year old girl enjoys it very much as she sings the songs and dance while playing but my older daughter just played once and then she became bored. If you haven't seen the movie you can't play with your kids because this game is 100% based on movie clips, songs and dance."
1,Not what we expected - boring!,"I bought this for my 11 year twin daughters, who are huge HSM fans. They were so excited to get it, and couldn't wait to play the game. Unfortunately, after we played the game for about 15 minutes, they got bored and wanted to stop. I have to admit, it was not too thrilling or interesting to play. The game set up is a little odd, and rather dull. Save your money for the ""Jump In"" CD - the next hot Disney TV musical out."
4,Get your head in THIS game,"If your a parent of any kid from 6-12, you will be shocked to play this game and find out you know more about High School musical then you EVER thought you would want to. There is basically trivia and finishing the lyric of the song (I couldn't believe that I could remember, but then again, I find myself singing ""get your head in the game"" at work sometimes) but there is also dancing, where you have to complete the move. This is hilarious. My daughter (9) gets a big kick out of me doing the dance steps. She has wiped the floor with me a couple times, but I am getting better. This is basically Scene It for High School musical and we love it!It also is a game that can be adjusted for time. Sometimes games can drag on and on but this one allows you to set the mark on how long the game will be, and as a busy mom, I LOVE that. I would highly recommend this game for kids as well as for a family togetherness game."
3,Know your stuff,"This game is cute, however a tad difficult. I bought for my 9 year old daughter and even though we love the movie and have watched it a hundred times we had a hard time finishing the game. The hardest part is the question regarding missing dance moves. They will show a clip from a dance number and skip part. You then have to do the missing moves. I don't think that I have gotten one right yet! There are other questions and singing parts to help you through."
4,Fan must have!,"My daughter, who absolutely adores High School Musical, loves this game! But so should others who play this game. And keep in mind, some of the questions will make you get up and ""finish"" a dance move as indicated on the dvd question. So it may or may not be a family game, but if it is, you have to get up and dance in front of everyone to answer some of the questions right, so you can't be dance-shy! :)"
4,What I wanted,"I was looking for a spare battery that would work with my iPod Nano, iPod, Shuffle and motorolla cell phone. The battery works great except for the Shuffle. Overall I'm pleased."
2,"It works, but there are problems.....","This is an ""ok"" USB battery. I have had it for over a year now and it still works just fine. I only use it once a month or so, but when I need it, I am very happy to have it.I have two problems with this device that drag it down to two stars;1) The case is starting to split a bit along the edge. It has been that way for a while, and not getting worse, but it does detract from the product. If that had not happened I would have given it three stars.2) There is no gauge of the amount of battery power left in the device. This is an issue for many external batteries. Without a gauge you never really know if you have an extra charge with you or not. I just charge it up before I go somewhere, but it would be nice to be able to check.Between the lack of a gauge, and the crack in the side, I give this two stars. While it is perfectly functional, it could be a lot better."
3,"Works fine for some devices, but NOT my iPod Touch or iPhone","This is a light and easy to use USB battery pack that effortless powers my Sony PSP, a USB reading light, or USB charged/powered cell phone. If you're thinking of using it for the iPod Touch or iPhone you might think twice. My unit will not charge either the iPhone, iPhone 3Gs, or the iPod Touch. If you want to charge/power these devices you migh consider buying an IMP500 (use ""imp500"" as a search term for All Departments on Amazon and you'll find the correct link) which does power the ""Touch"" and iPhone 3Gs (at least in my hands)."
3,Great on the go solution,Charges every thing that normally charges from USB except devices that need a software installed on the PC to charge like Sony Ericsson phones .(Update)Can't charge Iphone (all Models )
3,"Eh, it's ok.",This item when fully charged can charge my smartphone up to about full and then it's dead. So it's better then nothing when you're on vacation and your phone's about to die this thing will save the day but don't expect to much from it.
2,WEAK PULSE,"In spite of its intriguing premise, PULSE ultimately falls flat due to its slow pace and mediocre performances. The story focuses on a mysterious lightning storm that somehow converts electrical energy into a self-serving, intelligent killer. A little boy (Joey Lawrence) is visiting his father and new bride in California and he is convinced there are voices in the electricity. Cliff DeYoung is lifeless in his role as dad; Roxanne Hart brings some conviction to her role as the new wife. We're never really sure just what is going on and how electrical energy can also manage to lock doors, including a shower door and all the terror elements are so underplayed, they're never really all that threatening."
5,PULSE - The ultimate terror.,"Ellen, the young boy's stepmother, gets involved in this frightening story quite by accident in the shower. It is necessary to actually tear apart the shower door to attempt to save her. The ""Pulse"" is in the TV, the electricity, the hot water... everywhere. Naturally nobody believes them when they try to explain what it is. I have watched this video several times and I'm still not sure myself. A real thriller: Get it while you can. Exclusively at AMAZON.COM."
3,Not Quite Ghost In The Machine...,"I remember that there were a number of movies dealing with electricity around this time. This one is a bit confusing, as we don't know why the electric in the town has turned evil, or why it's targeting any one individual. It's worth checking out if you like these more generic ""the electricity is the enemy!"" movies."
3,"Destroy Your Home, Before It Destroys You!...","PULSE is about electricity gone bad. A young boy named David (Joey Lawrence) travels from his mum's home in Colorado to stay w/ his dad (Cliff De Young) in California. Little does he know that a freakish bolt of lightning has unleashed an evil, homicidal intelligence into the electric grid! This PULSE has taken up residence in a transformer just outside David's new abode, and has already jolted a neighbor to death! I was expecting another hilarious appliances-gone-mad movie like GHOST IN THE MACHINE, and was a bit disappointed by the ultra-slow build-up and lack of killer dishwashers, but the story was fairly engaging in a sappy sort of way. Joey Lawrence was a decent actor for his age, and should have done more than become a teen semi-icon. Oh well..."
3,some scenes didn't make sense!,"The movie was pretty good overall, but some of the scenes didn't make sense. Like the scene where the boy is in the garage and the ""pulse"" splits the gas pipe and jams the motor of the garage door opener. If the thing only moves through the electrical wires, then how did it get into the gas line? Also the door to the kitchen was mysteriously locked. The shower scene is also far fetched. I understand how the pulse could make the water heater kick on, but thats it! How could it increase the water pressure, make the water scalding hot, jam the nozzle so the water couldn't shut off, and jam the shower door? It's all bacially bad luck."
3,Pulse,"You can't SEE it. You can't HEAR it. But you can FEEL it. And it's growing stronger and more deadly by the minute. It turns televisions, microwaves, computers, dryers and furnaces into demonic weapons of destruction. It's PULSE--an electrifying tale of terror starring Cliff De Young, Roxanne Hart and Joey Lawrence. At first, 11-year-old David (Lawrence) is excited about visiting his dad Bill (De Young) and stepmother Ellen (Hart) for the summer. But when he discovers that the house next door was violently destroyed and the old man living there electrocuted, David begins to panic. Even in his own home, the lights...the appliances...the electrical systems are taking on an evil, vengeful life of their own. David and Ellen know something is wrong, but Bill just thinks they're paranoid. Is it crazy to fear that ""power"" can destroy you...if it wants to? From writer/director Paul Golding comes a well-crafted thriller that will keep your heart pounding. It's PULSE...the ultimate shocker."
1,Way overpriced and made for series one,"This plastic case, although a good idea for keeping Mighty Beanz in place fails for 2 reasons...#1 It is made for Series One Beanz...Each space is labeled with a name of a Series ONE Beanz...they are now selling Series 3 .#2 It is way overpriced.I suggest they reissue it without the Beanz names and cut the price in half."
3,Not the greatest,"The kids were excited to have cases for their beanz, and they learned to read a bit by reading the beanz names on the case, so they'd know where to put each one. But after lots of use (opening and closing) the ""hinge"" part started to tear. Perhaps if you are strictly a collector, and will put the case aside, it would be ok, but my kids are young and they wanted to play with it, taking the beanz in and out."
5,An exceptional book...,"Pilates Fusion is a great introduction, as well as an excellent resource for the more experienced Pilates student. The fitness industry has spun the work of Joseph Pilates in many different directions, but this book has a true spirit of evolution. In chapter one, the author has clearly articulated the intent of Pilates Fusion, while explaining the origins and honoring the the foundational work of Joseph Pilates. I have found this book to be a constant inspiration as well as a practical guide. The Spirit~one with nature, Listen To Your Body and Benefits side bars are encouraging as well as clarifying. Even after a number of years, I refer to Pilates Fusion to develop and grow my own integration of Pilates into my fitness routine."
5,Three way manifold,I have not had a chance to use yet but I would think it will work great if you are going to use it for low air volume such as nailers which is what I will use it for. I dont think it will work well of high volume tools at least not this size. shipped fast
3,The commentary is more interesting than the recipes.,"I am not wowed by this book as the recipes do not inspire me to try them. Also, the book is poorly designed and the finger pointing woman giving tips on every other page really turned me off. The best thing about the book is the commentary by the author."
3,Thomas goes to the circus,"My 3 year old son is a BIG fan of Thomas the Tank engine. He saw this book, and we have read it several times already...and it has only been at home for one night. :) It's a simple book, with nice bright illustrations. Any toddler who is a fan of Thomas will enjoy this book."
2,Spode Christmas Highball Glasses,"I ordered these glasses to add to my collection. However, they are cheap imitations of my original Spode glasses. First of all, the Xmas tree ""decals"" on these new ones are faded & matted in color compared to the original. Also, they are placed lower on the glass rather haphazardly compared to the original. They are not the same Spode glasses and I was so very disappointed. Same was true for the wine glasses which I ordered from Amazon. Poor quality compared to original. I did not return them because we were having a holiday party and I needed these glasses. They were better than nothing, but certainly not the original Spode glasses which we have loved over the years!"
5,Race Code War,This is a very informative and helpful book. I have learned a lot and seriously recommend that everyone read it!
5,OK! The most beautiful movie of all time,"This title would say more if you could see the author of it. I do not look like a guy that would call a movie""beautiful.""With a little bit of a subtle background on the Cultural Revolution and it's horrors, this movie transcends anything I ever saw. First, I watched it years ago and almost did not sit for the showing...a 40 year love story...""oh brother...give me a break.""Well...on review of it...about 7 minutes into the flick I was hypnotized.Zhang zi yi is about 18...she is an accomplished actress now...and well-known in USA.Forget this review...get the movie...RE: Amazon...excellent service...excellent delivery...excellent condition...as usual..."
3,"Good start, but I wanted more","The previous reviews by C. Goodwin and R. Walker pretty much sum the book up. I liked the book, but would have preferred a little more depth."
1,Anti-Siphon Valve,"The product was fine...but the shipping charges were outrageous! If I hadn't had to have this product immediately, I never would have bought from these people. The shipping charge amounted to $2 each for a product that only cost $2.60 to start with! Totally nuts!"
1,WORST PIECE OF CRAP,The Worst pos I've ever seen. There's only a few scenes repeated over and over again. It's extremely SLOW AND BORING. There are so much more in New England than what this shows. DO NOT BUY IT
1,"Fall in New England, not what I expected","I was disappointed with this video. It was not what I expected. The scenes were indeed great and the music was OK but I was expecting a lot more composition as far as barns, churches, views of small towns etc. On the back cover it states that it has content from Me, VT, NH and Ma. While watching the video you have no idea of where these scenes were shot. They should have included captions on the locations of where these places are. The waterfall was a gorgeous location, but where is it?If you are interested in only leaves, ponds and waterfalls then you'll like this video. If you're looking for more than this, then you'll probably be disappointed."
5,Fantastic Item,Had the video playing while family was over for Thanksgiving. Wonderful comments about the beautiful scenery.
1,edited like a bad music video,"I was hoping for something serene and peaceful that I could leave on in the background while I was writing. Instead, this piece is cut like a bad music video! For the subject matter it's practically hyperkinetic! I have to wonder what ADD film school dropout assembled this. Cut cut cut! Maybe we could settle on a shot and let it breathe a minute before another cut, huh??? Instead of buying this here, check my local Goodwill. Mine will soon be on sale there."
2,"Willing to read, but not for this price.","One hundred dollars is a steeep price for a book. The author should consider an ebook edition. If that happens, I will return and improve the ratings."
5,Horror in a sad way.,"The silverchair song ""Cemetery"" has a very haunting feeling bad makes you want to cry. The song ""Slab"" is a kickin mix of No Association, Slave, and Learn to Hate. Nick Launay, who produced the Freak Show album, mixed the songs adding parts that grind! And the final track is ""Cemetery"" but without the drums and violins. Throw it in you computer and have an interactive look at the band. Good single."
1,BIG Dissapointment!,"This album STINKS!!! I have The Grabbers' album ""The Way I Am"" and I LOVE IT! It's one of the best punk albums I've got (and I have over 500 CDs, so that should tell you how good it is)! I liked it so much that went out and found this other album by The Grabbers. The difference is like night and day! Whereas ""The Way I Am"" is a virtual punk rock masterpiece, ""The Hand Your Dealt"" is a total waste of time! How a band as good as The Grabbers could be responsible for a debacle like this is beyond me! In any case, don't waste your hard earned cash on ""The Hand Your Dealt"". IT'S AWFUL! It's inferior to ""The Way I Am"" in every respect. If you really want to hear The Grabbers at their best, skip this joke of an album and track down a copy of ""The Way I Am""!"
3,A great compilation in its day,"""Welcome To My World"" stands out in my mind for two reasons. First, it had much more the look and feel of an original release than a compilation. Second, it was my fourth Presley LP. I played it a million times between the time of purchase and Elvis' death 10 days later. I've played the CD less than 10 times.Since 1977, RCA/BMG has released a barrage of compilations -- including a few gems. I refer you to ""Walk a Mile in My Shoes"", box set of 70s material, ""Essential Elvis"" Volumes Four and Five, and the new ""Burning Love"" CD (not to be confused with ""Elvis Sings Burning Love and Hits from His Movies"")."
5,Much sought after cd for my library,"Great value when I see silly prices. Wanted this album as my tape is damaged and is now much sought after as a durable cd. I got perfect service via Amazon and supplier, correctly described and gret value."
1,oh god .... drunk uncle at Karaoke night?,Singing completely out of tune .... any wondering why the album is a flop. I really have to wonder about this guys sanity. Sounds like it was recorded in someones bathroom on a Tascam. The vocals are terrible. Is he drunk? Seriously ... wow. This is bad. This is like a really bad demo tape from a 40 year old used car salesman who decided to make a record one night with no previous training or experience. Called some neighbors over who could pay intruments but were not really familiar with the tunes .. or maybe just showed up for the session fee and tried not to laugh? My god .... this is just bad. Cant get over how out of tune the vocal are. Its really really bad.
1,ego driven drivel,"Well here we are. The beloved cat man of Kiss Peter Criss is deep into his solo career. He had felt Kiss held him back from the main stream. Now the new Kiss disc has reached number one and the best Criss can do is go on talk shows and take shots at the group that made him a millionaire, I suspect some creepy agent types are paid to hang around Criss and praise his genius. This disc is a poor effort at best. You could go to the local bar and find better players. Peter WE THE FANS have voted with are dollars. Dont waste any money here."
1,Peter Criss just doesn't get it,"I was looking forward to this CD. I was hoping it would have songs on it that resembled the straight ahead rockers Peter had written occasionally with KISS. Songs like ""Dirty Livin"", ""Baby Driver"" come to mind.There is NOTHING on this CD that remotely resembles a rock and roll song.Apparently Peter sees himself as a Frank Sinatra...This CD is sad, it's depressing, I had to force myself to listen to it completely. Yes, It's that bad. I rated it ONE star because amazon does not give the option of ZERO stars, or NEGATIVE stars! At one point I contemplated sticking sharpened pencils into my eardrums so I wouldn't have to hear anymore.I'm a huge KISS fan, but I have to believe song writing like this is the reason Paul and Gene didn't allow Peter more songs on KISS albums.Peter says this CD is for his fans. What fans want to hear this sludge?Do something that rocks like the aforementioned songs and maybe I'll buy THAT CD"
2,Below Average,I love Peter's voice but his song writing is weak on this and his voice has lost a little edge but this is an easy listening recording so maybe if he rocks out on the next one it will bring him back.
5,A new side of the Catman,"For those expecting a Kiss album, you are going to be deeply disappointed. But, if you want to hear a pure, clean and well-done mix of music, you will be very pleased. The words to several of the original pieces brought me to tears or made my heart soar. Each has deep meaning. Listen! The standards are all done with a unique interpretation and interesting phrasing -- and are more than pleasing. The instrumentals on almost all of the numbers are simply awesome. I listened through the CD at one point, just marveling at the quality of the different instruments on each recording. The arrangements are outstanding. Peter's voice still has the unique quality that is Peter's voice and, is strong, clear and more than good. His heart is in that voice and it shows.As I said, if you want Kiss, don't buy this. If you are comparing it to that genre it comes up short; but for a fresh and wonderful new side of the Catman, One for All is a MUST purchase."
1,Kittie Litter!!,"Lets be honest , Paul Stanley is ,was and forever will be the man in Kiss . Even Gene is but a bit player when it comes to talent in the legacy of Kiss as real writers because after the make-up years , he sucked . Ace and Peter both had moments of cool in the band , but when left to make a full album they would be left wanting. Although the first solo's by Ace and Peter were great (Ace) and good (Peter).So what can I make of the Catmans newest piece . I could not even get through it. His voice cannot , I repeat handle a full album of slow numbers. It just is not that strong and the songwriting is at best , weak. There are two decent numbers here but that is it. Hopefully when he comes back with a rock album it will make up for this very poor outing."
1,Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"This ""album"" is a nightmare. It is 12 songs with no melody. Even the 2 he remade are awful, and don't get me started on his singing. His singing makes Ace Frehley sound like Freddy Mercury!!! As bad as Gene Simmons' last album was this is even worse. Do yourself a favor and get Live to Win because this one is a joke"
2,Please don't make me listen to this ever again,"The only thing good about this album is the production is good quality.The material lacks any merit.The songs are weak, not even a snowballs chance in hell of any charting here.The vocals are lame, the lyrics are dull, Sorry to say it but it's true.What is this supposed to be? Blues, Pop, Jazz, I' couldn't tell you anymore than it is a failed attempt to make something.....Peter needs to focus on something that old fans would dig, stop trying to be someone you are not, and or ever going to be. Try anything else but this crap. Team up with someone who will carry you.Peter, you are not a crooner.This album will tank if it has not already and it will be most likelyimpossible to ever get backing on anything else.The final nail has sealed his career coffin.Its a damn rotten shame."
2,ROMANCE & SLEEPY TIME,"ROMANCE & SLEEPY TIME, these songs are good for a romantic mood, or just any old music in the background, sum talent in there, im not bagging this product, but i KNOW peter can do much better, ive heard his genius album SOLO 1/KISS, and the other songs his written within kiss,and his 3rd album let me rock you. not bagging him as if it wasnt for a peter criss album i would not no kiss or peter criss, not his full potential"
1,Another lousy KISS member solo album,"I really would have loved for Peter to put out an excellent album, just to rub it in Gene and Paul's face. They have destroyed KISS' legacy (more so Gene than Paul) Peter's last chance was on the KISS reunion album, Psycho Cicus and he blew it along with the rest of the band. This album sounds as if it was thrown together over a weekend, I understand trying to capture that organic, genuine ambiance, but you risk coming off sounding amateurish, and unfortunately with this effort it's the latter. Good luck next time Peter. C'mon school those fools, Gene and Paul on why their fans have stuck around for over thirty years."
1,TERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIBLE,"I love Peter, in fact I think his 78 solo album is the best one, and also like ""Let me rock you"" and ""Out of control"" quite a lot. Peter was involved in many of my very favorite KISS songs ever (""Dirty livin'"", ""Baby Driver""...)But this album is PLAIN AWFUL, starting with a cover that Peter designed himself, that sucks big time. The songs sound pretty much the same, have no power, no chorus to remember, no nothing. The lyrics are laughable, And the song about Ace? Probably Ace won't ever talk to him after this one!!!I have given it a second (and a 3rd, and a 4th...) try and, well, there's something here, and there, some hooks, some melodies... but the problem is that not very many people will be as patient as me giving it so many chances."
3,Team Player,"I think Peter is at his best as a contributor...as part of a band, working with a team...getting feedback on his creative ideas. This is the best situation for most musicians in my view. Peter needed a producer on this one. A few of the songs on this record are ok, but thats it.I'll always remember Peter in KISS singing Black Diamond, Nothin to Lose, Baby Driver, Hard Luck Woman, and Beth. The classics can't be matched."
2,Disapointed...,"It's not a terrible cd, but I expected more from the catman. ""Send in the Clowns""??? Come on Pete, you can do better than this. I wanted more ""Black Diamond"", ""Hard Luck Woman"", ""Out of Control"" and maybe even a ""Beth"". But ""Send in the Clowns""??? ""Space Ace"" is kind of cool. Some nice jazz moods on the cd. But all in all, the songs are not memorable and you don't find yourself wanting to hear them again. Sorry Pete."
1,YOK BEURK :),"Peter where are you ?Well I was waiting this brand new album, hoping for great tunes as the catman used to make, but after listening to this CD I am very disappointed. I do not like it at all.Now I am waiting for Ace new album, please spaceman remember your true fans."
1,Bury this one in the literbox,"I also a KISS fan from day one wasn't expecting a KISS album.I was kinda hoping for a follow up to the Criss Cat#1 CD,but didn't get that as well.This was more like rock star turning lounge singer at best,there is nothing here that could even give Beth a run for it's money.(I mention Beth because of the mellowness of the song.)Don't waste your money on this unless your a true hardcore KISS fan such as myself and have to have everything they release just to keep my collection complete.Go to the BestBuy and get the hand written autographed edition,and get something for your money."
2,Like a PUG,"Have you ever seen one of those flat nosed dogs that was so ugly it was cute? This reminds me of that. The songs are so bad that they're almost good. There is a certain comic effect to this record that nearly rates it a three stars. Pete can't sing, can't play, but this is so awful that it's entertaining, almost!"
1,Wat The!!!!,"Man This cd is as bad as the 78 solo. Peter should have staid behind kiss and not ventured out.Im a fan of 32 years, all I can say is god bless gene,ace,and paul for finding Eric Carr when they did. The only true drummer of kiss. Singer is kool to.By the way How did he write beth and dirty livin? Maybe he didn't. I am ashamed,for kiss. Not for peter. He should have been in a Jazz band."
3,More Purrs than Meowing...,"If you are a Peter Criss fan, it's worth having just for your collection. Overall, it's good. Be aware, though, if you're looking for Dirty Livin' or Tossin and Turnin', you won't find it here. This album is more Easy Thing and Hard Luck Woman, with a splash of Bobby Darin thrown in for good measure. 'What Difference a Day Makes'is one of my favorite songs, and Peter did a nice job with it. It's jazzy, a little bluesy in some places and is nearly all slower(with a few really good)ballads. A very sweet album. No big balls or thundering drums on this one. The only thing holding it back from really shining is the production quality. It could have been a bit more polished."
1,It's Time to Hang it Up!,"Out of all stars in KISS, Peter and Ace have always been my favorites. The only Solo's I bought in the 70's were those from Ace and Peter. ""I can't Stop the Rain,"" from Peter's Solo, being my favorite of all time favorite Peter Criss song - even more than Beth. That being said, I can't understand this album. I was listening to it with my son (KISS fan too), and I was embarrassed when he said that it sucked. This doesn't diminish my feelings about the band, my favorites Ace and Peter, nor all they have accomplished throughout years because I will die with my KISS shirt on; but when it's time to hang it up, it's time to hang it up.!"
2,"Sorry Pete, but this one sucks.","Love this guy & everything he has done besides this. Absolute trash, off-key, & horribly written / executed. Simply a waste of money."
3,"some good info, some biased material","This book is worth reading for the appendix and details on trip handicapping, but the material on track biases smacks of type 1 errors (finding differences that aren't really there)."
3,A little basic,"This book is a little bit on the basic side, but gives a nice review of different option strategies. Nothing advanced, but still a nice summary of different strategies."
3,Tough Problem - Weal Solution,"""Plan B' is divided in to two parts - the problem including increasing population, environmental degradation, food shortages, disease migration, and the solution to them. This was a superior analysis of the scope and depth of the problems this world faces. Unfortunatgely I found the ""Plan B"" solution(s) familiar, ie. hydrogen fuel, population control, etc. I wanted to see some real creative ideas which were just not there. Ideas like redesigning public education, a global task forces on food allocation, or free morning-after pills. The time for being ""politically-correct"" is running out. Something this author just didn't face."
4,A must read for anyone concerned with the future of the planet.,"The author outlines the problems that we face today with water, energy, pollution, aids, global warming, etc. and he proposes solutions.In other words there is a way out of this mess but it will take a great deal of will and courage by all peoples of the world, particularly governments, to move us to Plan B because Plan A, business as usual, will ultimately lead to catastrophe."
1,Not Worth The Wait,"I'm sure the product itself is great (I've purchased Herb Pharm products in the past and am always extremely pleased!), but the wait just isn't worth it. I could find it somewhere else online and get it 10X faster. I ordered my Red Root on June 26th. Today is July 27th, and to my knowledge, the item still hasn't even been shipped, due to some backorder problem. I needed this Red Root to help cleanse my lymph system; I suffer from Lyme disease and get swollen, painful glands. Waiting over a month to get a product to help just doesn't cut it."
4,Good Example of an Ethnography,"A classic example of an ethnography. I read this as part of a qualitative research course in grad school. Based on research from 1979-1987, the material seems dated at this point (2008), but is illustrative of the second wave of feminist critical theory."
1,actual color not shinny,actual color not shinny at all...it was dull black and had to return it. they should say in their descrip that it is not glossy paint
4,Functional and keeps mail dry!,"I bought this as a replacement for our old mailbox, which leaked and got our mail wet whenever it rained. This has kept mail dry in major storms, which was my biggest concern. It is easy to open/close and is very large (at least compared to our old mailbox). Looks nice from the front of the house and overall I am very pleased with it.My only complaints are 1) I wish it came with mounting hardware and 2) the magazine hooks are so loose they are always crooked, so I took them off. I wouldn't use them much anyways so it wasn't a big deal, but the little things are why I didn't give it 5 stars."
3,Mail Box,"This is a nice size mailbox, but the newspaper hanging down things are just loose and wobbly. I recently took them off of the mailbox. I keep the lid open to prevent from scratching against the wall when it is opened and closed. Overall a nice mailbox for buying it online and not seeing it in person."
4,Sturdy Mail Box,"Overall a pretty sturdy mailbox. A few flaws though, the newspaper holders are very flimsy and mounting screws are not included."
4,Gets the job done,"I like how it's like an envelope, although the little arms on the bottom are wobbly and that's a little inconvenient. Nonetheless it does get the job done."
3,Nice Sampler,"Normally samplers are bad, but on this one at least 50% of the songs are good. Bigwig, Blout, Drunk In Public, and 30FootFall are good bands."
2,Remote Electrical control,Purchased two of these units and one has failed in less than a year. It is a good concept but must have a longer life. Very senstive to temperature.
3,museum wax,Good wax to hold down small hummels and other small items -I wish they made a larger size? Thanks Larry
1,Don't waste your money,"As a ""no stars"" rating is not available, I am giving this the lowest rating possible, 1 star.There are lots of good guidebooks out there, this cannot be counted among them. This guide seems more cobbled together than anything else. I would recommend the Passporter guide or the Unofficial Guide over this. Both would be money better spent."
2,OUT OF DATE,"While this may be an OK guide, please note that it was reprinted in 2006 withOUT being updated. Much of the information here is no longer true -- there are tips for attractions that don't exist anymore! Particularly troubling are inaccuracies related to ticketing, park hours, special events, on-site amenities, and dining/recreation/reservation policies. Some hints are still applicable and therefore helpful, but unknowing first-timers (or anyone who selects this guide as his/her sole source of information) will be misled in significant ways."
1,Disappointment,I ordered this edoc to help me think about talking to my 11-year old daughter about her weight/heaviness.This edoc was not lengthy nor was it filled with concrete helpful guidance about this topic. Do not bother purchasing this!
3,Book Review,This book consists of a collection of works (articles) written by Palestinian authors regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is a historiographical work and introduces works that have been written regarding the conflict since 1948. It adds incite into various issues that are recently being brought to light regarding the conflict and issues that have been previously explored. This scholarly edition adds to the ever growing understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1948.
1,How low can you go,"The editor of this volume Ilan Pappe has devoted his academic career to deligitimizing the state in which he lives and works. He has slandered Israel at every possible opportunity, always denying and covering up the basic truth that the source of the conflict between Israelis and Arabs has always been the refusal of the Arabs to live in peace with a Jewish state, even in a small part of the Holy Land. Pappe ignores the daily propaganda of the Palestinians, the hatefilled rhetoric that has accompanied the conflict from its outset. Even more importantlyall his retellings ignore the part the Palestinians, and the Arab states have played in initiating aggression against Israel.Pappe is a low- grade propagandist and Benedict Arnold.Who reads him reads misinformation only."
3,Could Be Better.,"The arrangements included in this book are simplistic. The melody line is written into the piano score and its faith to the original recordings is middling at best (One Flight Down isn't even the same key). ""The Nearness Of You"" is easily the arrangement that shines the most.As a warning, if you struggle with rhythm, you may have some initial trouble, as this book is filled non-standard (read: Jazz and not classical) rhythms. Break out your pencil, sub-divide and give it an hour or two and you should be alright."
1,Didn't work in my Pond,A friend recommended this product for the Algae. I was expecting it to work for mine. It didn't do anything. I even used a second one hoping for better results. I just have a 100 gallon pond. I want buy again.
5,Keith Whitley is one of country music's best.,"If you're an avid country music fan and are knowledgeable of the Keith Whitley story, you will be mesmerized by this CD. I own this and will play it on repeat for hours at a time. Keith's rich voice and touching lyrics get me all choked up as I listen to him. He also reminds me to hang on to every day as it may be your last."
4,really soothing,I really loved the soothing effect his songs and voice has on me especially after a hard day. Music you can never get tired of listeneing to. My husband and I really love listening to him. No regrets buying his cd as this is the first time I am buying a cd of keith whitley. If your a total romantic then he's a good choice.
5,LOVE IT,You make it so easy to check things out before I buy. Your information has been correct on everything I purchase.
2,messed up,Though the item did arrive in a timely manner. The songs on the cd are out of order and its missing some songs. i would not recommend this item.
3,Balanced Healing,This book contains some good tips to improve your health using alternative means. If you are into natural treatment this book may be for you..
5,First choice for medical information and treatment,Balanced Healing is the first book I consult when I have a medical question. I was a patient of Dr. Altshuler and greatly respect his advice.The book is easy to read and follow his suggestions. I expecially like the fact that he starts with the simplest and least potentially harmful treatments and progresses to those which are in line with current medical practice.I have used this book for at least six years and have purchased and given copies to relatives.
5,Balanced Healing: Combining Modern Medicine with Safe & Effective Alternative Therapies,"Excellent publication. The author is to be congratulated for a Balanced presentation of topics described therein.Easy to understand with extensive references, that are easily followed and actually ecourages you to apply practically in your desire to overcome various ailments that afflict you."
2,Blues Played At 1/4 Speed,"This is blues played at about a quarter the regular speed. Of course, that's Cowboy Junkies' style: play everything slow. But in this case, it doesn't work. Listening to this album does nothing to prepare you for the quiet, simple brilliance of the Trinity Session album. What a leap up that was!"
2,Does not have any Date feature!!,I was happy that this watch would have all the basic functionalities in it as it is mentioned in the prduct description but I felt very cheated once I gt it deliverd and found that there is no Date display on this watch. Is this just to mention or I have got the wrong watch? Please make sure before u purchase it.
1,"Been There, Done That.","The usual SoCal Fat Wreckchords sound. only this band is from NJ. and they try to sound like they are from CA. It's been done before - by many other bands, many many other times."
5,Best Skate-Punk Around,"This album is one of the best skate-punk albums I've ever heard. The music is fast, with a heavy poppy sound. The lyrics on this album go from serious to humorous depending on what track you listen to,and the vocals are perfect for this style of music. By this album if you like skate-punk that is top of the line."
4,It cooks!,"Actually the review title should be ""it warms!"". This is a nice little oven that will warm food but you have to use it a few times to get to know how long cerain items will take to heat. Depending on if your food is frozen or just cold, it will take between a half hour to an hour to heat up sufficiently. It's a little smaller that I thought it would be but it's easy to transport. I use little tin pans and with a little planning, this product does what I need it to do."
2,man... dont buy,"two stars because it worked for two days, I was on the road truckin... and needed something to heat up leftover pizza from lunch for dinner worked twice and then for a reason unbenounced to me only the bottom of the unit would heat up not allowing the cooker to fully heat my food. it would take a good 30 min when it worked good to heat pizza up to a good temp. not recommended"
1,garbage,very very cheep quality and they send broken item.oven is not good quality and he wast my money 2 time i send back oven
1,Put a clothespin on your nose before viewing this film,"Because it stinks. Some cool recycled spaceship footage, an unlikely mystery acceleration transports our unlikeable heroes into the future, some goon-like cavemen attack them, they fight comically awful giant spider puppets, they meet the subterranean human survivors of a nuclear holocaust... blah blah blah. It's dead boring, folks, there is a good reason you've never heard of this movie. Yes, it really is that bad."
2,"oh no, wrld w/o end...","...as far as monstas in this show-only 1 brief scene of 2 rubber spiders rt. aft. the spaceship lands, no more monstas next to the weird cavepeople vs the too normal spacepeople. some good actors in the ok story. i like to see more monsta action first in these type films."
3,I'm not a big fan of the Mad King,"There are Burroughs fans who love this novel, but I'm not a big fan of this particular story. You can read about it in the reviews of much cheaper editions than this one. Just a reminder that McClurg is the first edition and G&D's are reprints. ""All Lustadt was in an uproar. The mad king had escaped."""
1,Not worth it.,"I am a member of Bowie Net. When they heard about this CD, they put out information on it saying not to buy it. It contains clips of interviews that if you're a Bowie Fan, you've most likely heard before. The booklet contains some slightly rare photographs but no actual Bowie music. I'll try to copy and paste the article as soon as I can. The article also said that the package says on it: ""Maximum Bowie is presented in a format that Bowie himself would surely approve of.."" And then Bowienet said: ""We seriously doubt that."" Trust me, this album isn't worth it."
2,This is not Elvis. . .,"Elvis Presley is a hard-rocking man from the fifties, banging out hit after hit, such as ""Hound Dog,"" ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" and ""All Shook Up."" That is Elvis. During this period, drugs were in control, and he was not able to play as he could before. He is weak, out of energy, quiet and dull. He has also lost his looks since the fifties. This is not Elvis at all, and don't be fooled. This CD looks like it has a lot of good songs on it. Elvis is two verses short on ""Johnny B. Goode,"" two verses short on ""What I'd Say,"" and two verses short on ""Jailhouse Rock."" How can you like music that's only half of the music? I feel bad for Elvis; I really do.Still, there are a couple good songs in here, such as ""Hound Dog,"" and ""That's All Right Mama,"" and for those two songs I give it two stars. Other than that, I really didn't think this album was very good.If you want to hear Elvis, and not this weak old guy, I'd recomend The '68 Comeback Special, or Live at Madison Square Gardens."
3,lack luster performance,"recorded in 1977, this recording offers nothing new to the fan or collector, other than a worn out fat elvis trying to belt out song like he did 7 yrs earlier. a few songs are done ok and are acceptable...elvis's last hurrah !"
4,Elvis was the best,"I was never a big Elvis Presley fan while I was growing up in the 50's; I just didn't like much of what he did, musically. In 1977, shortly after his passing, my wife bought the boxed set, ""The Other Sides"". These were the ""B"" sides of many of his hits - I was blown away by his mastery of some great songs that were not recorded just to sell to the ""POP"" crowd. I became a big fan overnight and now have most of what he recorded. This particular CD is very good, but he was obviously in declining health and it is not his greatest concert recording. That being said, I think I will sit back right now and watch his 1968 special, again."
4,Elvis In Concert,I loved this CD the performance i thought was very good in spite of his bad health his voice never failed him and that was a gift from God and Elvis knew it. That is why he always gave his all to please his fans no matter how bad he felt. This is what sets Elvis apart from all the other musicians in the world he cared and he never forgot where he came from and especially his fans he gave his all that's why i recommend this CD to every Elvis fan who doesn't own it.Anne
2,An unfortunate ending to a landmark life,"As doped as Elvis was, he still pulls off some miracles on this record. But unfortunately, RCA seemed to be cashing in on his death with the release of this double album. ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" is truly sad, as he forgets the words and laughs his way through the ""Act one"" part. On ""My Way,"" he says, ""I don't know the words, so I'm reading off a piece of paper."" Sad, sad, sad. Plus, RCA put on fan responses to his death in another cheap ploy to milk his death to the bone. For Elvis enthusiasts only."
5,A Must Have!,This album is awesome. There are so many great tracks on thisalbum I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start at See SeeRider. This is the best version RCA ever recorded. Its really upbeat. The Teddy Bear/Don't Be Cruel melody is also very good. Hurt was never better. I really don't want to know sounds very lonley which makes it sound awesome. My favorite version of You gave me a mountain is on this album. The I Got A Women/Amen melody is awesome because of its raw energy. If you love me let me know is also very good. There is a ok version of Jailhouse Rock on this album. Overall a really good buy...
1,He was human afterall,"I saw Elvis in Dayton, Ohio during 1972. Some of it (maybe all) was recorded for 'On tour'. He was the greatest performer, singer and showman that ever was and probably ever will be. He was blessed in so many ways. I wondered in 1972 if the man was human. This album and movie proves that the blessing may have been a curse and yes, he was human. In 1972, he didn't come on stage, he mounted it. He was in 100% total control of us, his voice, his manerisms, etc... I don't ever want to see or hear this again. Elvis is a VERY, VERY sick man. I'll stick to 'That's the way it is', On tour, and Aloha..... They are timeless."
1,Listen to him slip away,"One of his last concerts is difficult to listen to. Elvis forgets his lyrics and is obviously barely going through the motions. At this point in time, he is incapable of performing. A mere shadow of the man who stunned the world a few years earlier with his NBC special. The glorious pictures on the cover are not indicative of the contents of this CD. A sad finale to one of the greatest performers of all time as he would be gone a few months after this."
4,Elvis not at his best but ..,"The media has made a concerted effort to degrade this last concert by Elvis. For certain, it is not his best performance of his career.If one looks objectively at the state of the man's health at the time, there are some brilliant performances here. One only has to listen to the passion expressed by Elvis on Unchained Melody to find his talent carried through to the end.This cd will surprise."
5,No Dissapointments here!,"Elvis' voice was terrific and his delivery will be yours to enjoy for many years. A great selection of songs along with introductions of his father and Ginger Alden and, of course, his band. Overall, everyone was in great form the night of this concert! Faith-Bloomfield Hills, MI"
1,Not good.,"Keep in mind there are great live Elvis concerts but this is far from one of them. Elvis was burning out and this concert is solid proof of that. From slurred speech, to missed lyrics, to incoherent mumbling, this was a sad sad sight on the dvd and sounds just as sad on this live release. If you must have a complete Elvis discography pick this up but if you are looking for a great live Elvis performance pass this one by and avoid the DVD/blue ray of this concert."
1,Gives a rather dated and distorted view of Christianity,"This collection of poems about the Galatians was a severe disappointment in all aspects. I concur with the first reviewer, who suggested that the poetry was appalling. The numerous errors and typos made the poems very irritating to read. I can only assume that this was the author's first attempt at writing poetry, as it needs much improvement to be considered `top class'.The poems conveyed messages that portray Christianity as a violent religion setting out to convert and subjugate followers of other faiths. Whilst it is true to say that in mediaeval times Christians took part in the crusades, which involved a certain amount of violence etc., it is a fallacy to suggest this is still the case.As a Christian I've always alluded to the view that Christianity is a tolerant faith preaching goodwill to all mankind.I would recommend giving this one a miss because it gives an inaccurate impression of Christianity and may cause offence."
1,Very poor and presents an ante diluvian view of christianity,"The quality of this piece of literature is amongst the poorest I have ever read. The standard of English used was very poor indeed. The langauage used in some of the poems did not flow well and this made it particularly annoying to read.e.g. What led this leader of a violent mobPersecuting ChristiansTo this stage?To pen a letterTo churches in GalatiaIn encouragementAnd supportA masterpiece of the didactic epistleA part of the christian canonNeed I say more?The messages conveyed within some of the poems portray Christianity as religion that tolerates and uses violence to achieve its aims. I can only assume that the author holds rather ante diluvian views when it comes to the Christian religion.If you enjoy reading good poetry, this book is best avoided."
1,Terrible poetry!,"The standard of poetry in this book by Kim is a joke. I've seen better poetry from 10 year old schoolboys. Kim's poems are uninspiring, dreary and convey dangerous ideas. The underlying messages portray Christianity in a very bad light i.e. violent and uncompromising. Kim seeks to attack Jews and Judaism at every opportunity, which I'm sure many Jewish readers would find offensive. Christians are likely to find this book equally offensive as the poems preach messages in the name of Christianity that are contrary to its beliefs and ideals. Kim's approach is rather supercilious such that he comes across as being `preachy' and condescending.This book should be left on the supermarket shelf as it misrepresents Christianity and could cause offence to many readers."
5,brave,"In an age when Christian writers write pop-junk and refuse to treat relevant issues of the day for the average Christian, I have to appaud Heerak Christian Kim for being brave and being faithful to the Word of God. This is an inspirational writing that can be used even in preaching. Certainly, this book is great for spiritual meditation and Bible study discussions."
1,Mormon and Pyschic based program,"I was shocked to find out that this program is filled with Mormon theology. It is based on such theories as Suggestology, which is listed under Pychic studies in Amazon search. This is just not a program that I think any child or adult should expose themselves to.Here is a list of the other theories this method is based on and where the information can be found:Suggestopedy by LoranovTotal Physical Response by AsherSilent Way by GattengoComprehension Approach by Krashen*As described in Dr. Blair's book Innovative Approaches to Language Teaching."
2,Not as tough as I had hoped,"Used this product on our glass-topped outdoor patio table. It worked well for about a month, then the table and leg I had glued came apart again. I will have to keep looking for a better product"
3,lack luster performance,I bought this product to fix a cake stand. While it was shock proof it didn't exactly dry clear. There was a white powder like residue around the surface when it dried which I had to remove with acetone. I was not overly happy with its durability. I hand washed the product rroughly a week after fixing it and it fell apart again. The glue was tacky where the piece had been attached. I feel like it would have been ok had I never washed it but that was not the case here.
1,Did not work for me,"I purchased this to try to glue a piece of glass that had broken off a small replica of a gondola purchased in Venice. Unfortunately, it did not do the job, perhaps because the break was in a spot with insufficient surface area for the pieces to adhere."
4,This worked great to mend a piece of glassware...,"I used this to mend a piece of expensive glassware that had a piece split off... and it did the job with no trouble. Dried clear, can't even tell there was ever a problem."
4,Wonderfully Written,"I extremenly enjoyed reading this book. You don't have to love poem...if you love God and love to praise him, this book is for you. It is very easy to read and to understand...makes a wonderful gift to anyone."
2,popcorn,did not like this it was too gross and all the bad things in it i would recomend you read more carefully before you buy this not happy with this
4,Startling and beautiful Deck,"I've wanted this deck for a long time, but i knew it was more of a past life recall and reflection deck than a tarot deck, which is what i read with. I have found that although i can't tell what is actually going on in someone's life with it, i can tell where they are emotionally with a situation, and i use it all the time for myself to find out what is really bothering me about a situation , what a particular person or circumstance is bringing up for me subconsciously and underneath my every day insight.The pictures do reach into my subconscious and i actually do get flashbacks at times from reading them. No matter what you do with this deck, i think its lovely, fascinating, and i can't imagine a day when i wouldn't get something completely new from reading them. I wish the author's had written more. It is simply the most consistantly beautiful deck i've ever seen."
4,I love this song!,"The Wilkinsons continue their tradition of fun and positivity with their new single ""I Wanna Be That Girl."" This upbeat tune is very catchy, and I always find myself singing it. If you are looking for a song that is fun and always keeps you in a good mood, choose anything by Wilkinsons! None of their songs have a negative message!"
4,Musician Alert,"If you are a classical musician (or wannabe like me), this is a fun poster to have. Your musician friends will immediately recognize the music stands everywhere, and your other friends will think you're a little more avant garde than they thought. The price is right, the artist is famous, and you can't go wrong if you are happy with prints and not originals.I have given this as a first job gift several times, and it seems to be a hit. Thanks, Amazon for making it affordable."
2,Just too boring....,"I wasn't happy with this book, but to be fair to this fabulous author, I went back and read it again. Unfortunately, it was just as boring the second time around. I don't know what happened to this one. The characters didn't shine, and there was no spark in the story."
4,works good,it takes off the nasty white stuff that develops on your tongue...just wish it took off even more than what it does.
1,"Sorry, it gave me a bump on my lips",Perhaps I have allergy to metal but I developed a zit like bump on the side of my lips. I cant say what caused that reaction.
1,too sharp,"too sharp found my tongue bleeding from using this,I used it once and its put away somewhere. will stick to targets plastic brand."
5,Simply outstanding.,"On my 1976 Gremlin 258, this fit perfectly, and replaced a multi-part seal that was prone to leakage. I'd highly recommend this. There are washers molded into the gasket that help prevent overtorquing the bolts and crushing the gasket (although that is still possible...)I wish I'd had this gasket type on every oil pan I've replaced, sure saves the hassle."
4,does not fit on every bow!,"I just purchased my first recurve bow and ordered this thinking it would be better than just shooting of the shelf. When I received it right away I realized the string was meant for a compound bow, to short to attach to a recurve. All the instructions were for attaching it to a compound bows pulley string. Being new to archery I have no idea if these rest are exclusively used on compounds or can be used on recurves. All I read in the description was that it fit on any bow! Well long story short I got a longer string and attached it to the recurve, and it seems to shoot fine. Still don't know if your supposed to use these arrow rest on recurves but hey it works!"
3,the rest is ok but the stick on arrow hold isnt,the pakage arrived promptly it was in good condition with clear instructions on set uppros.it has full adjustibility and was more or less as acurrate as a buiscut.the rest function is a good idea a works quite well untill the stick on grove falls off.sturdy constructionconsthe stick on arrow hold that you pop the arrow in came appart(but not unstuck. the sticky part is still on the bow but the hold came off the sticky part) this means the arrow needs to be held in position with a finger until the rest rises to the fire position... rather pointless for a fall away arrow rest. would have gotten 4 stars if that arrow hold had stayed on...go with a buiscut i think you will be happier.
2,Slightly better than Divided We Stand,"At first I couldn't put this album away, I enjoyed the skate punk sound from these guys, but after about 6 months I realized that all their songs sound the same on each album, while also realizing that they were a lot less talented than I built them up to be. I can say one thing, I enjoy the lyrics on this album."
4,Deeper and Deeper,"While not quite as complete as the first volume, this second volume really fills in the story quite well. Lenore and Spiaggi are still on the trail of the truth.Here Lenore first meets the Raptors and what they represent. We also meet Aznar Akeba and learn some of his fate in all of this. We learn of the origin of the current troubles. We also learn of Lenore's family and how it has shaped her.While this is less of a complete adventure it does serve very well to move the plot along and develop the main threads. Although the story remains fresh, there is something almost deja vous about Lenore's predicament near the end of the volume.Once again the story develops and moves at a good pace while being backed by excellent artwork. The story continues and the reader wants to follow it to its conclusion."
4,Part two of a gothic melodrama,"The second part of a semi-erotic gothic melodrama. The main characters are a vampire brother and sister who prey on their fellow vampires because they have become weak,""too human."" But the story really follows a female cop as she tries to make sense of all the wierd killings going on (doesn't help things that her ex-boyfriend is a vampire!). Sort of the X-files meets la femme Nikita meets watered down Anne Rice. It's actually quite good and not predictable on how it's going to turn out. A good hour or so read and lovely art."
3,Review,"The product was good, beautiful music; only problem was I was disappointed to find a cassette when I expected a CD."
5,5 Star Sound,"I bought this Receiver to create a custom setup of 7.1 channel system in the living room. JBL Wall-mounted Front Left/and Right Channel, Cerwin-Vega centre channel, These Speakers as Ceiling Mounted Surround Left/Right and Surround-Back Left/Right and a powered sub-woofer. Installation was hassle-free, the included templates to mark the spot for holes were a nice touch and very thoughtful of the manufacturer. Excellent sound quality."
5,Phoenix Gold ATc8 first impressions,"I put these in as surrounds in my basement this week and they were real easy to install - took about 15 minutes per speaker to cut the holes in the drop ceiling tiles using the cut-out template provided and to hook up the speakers and mount them securely. They sound great, though they aren't being taxed very heavily as surrounds. I would definitely recommend these if you can get the pair for under $100"
4,Very Nice,"These are a great addition to complete any surround system (especially 7.1) Purchased them for 79.99, which was a steal. Deliver a medium level amount of base (but not something you need to be concerned with if you already have a decent subwoofer and are simply using these as surround speakers.) Very crisp and clear sound. Adjustable tweeters are also a very nice perk!"
3,3 stars for the artwork 1.5 for the story...,"This was okay. Batman was a wussy alot of the time, his whining about killing Judge Death in the first story was really, really annoying. Otherwise the stories were okay...Unlike some other reviewers, I really liked the artwork, the campy bright gore filled pictures made me smile. There is a nice picture of the Joker juggling the 4 ""bad judges"" (I cannot remember their real names) that is almost worth the cost of the book...."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This is one of those inter-company crossover stunts, really. Two granite jawed lawmen with little tolerance for outsiders with strange abilities in their cities, must find a way not to beat the hell out of each other too badly, and eventually work together to stop a threat in Mega-City. Dredd tells Batman at the end of the Gotham based part of the story that it is foreseen he will be needed in Dredd's town."
2,Fun Game - Very Poor Directions,"This is a pretty good game, but the directions were very poor. My wife and I read and reread the directions for 15-20 minutes or so. There are several cards that just don't make sense. We played the game and it was fun, but it 'didnt feel right' because we werent really sure what to do in certain situations.It must take a lot of effort to make a game like this. Wouldnt it make sense to have some people test it for playability before release?"
2,Game review,"Growing up, my favorite game was called ""On Assignment"" put out by National Geographic in which players had to travel the world identifying countries via pictures and clues. When I saw this game, I hoped it would be similar in nature.First of all, the directions on this game were confusing and had to be read repeatedly before I finally understood how to play.As my husband and I began to play, we quickly lost interest as there was no challenge in identifying the locations- the cards just state what the picture is. It's simply a roll of the dice game. I think this game would be good for young children as a fun way to expose them to various famous landmarks."
2,"Had Potential, but Very Disappointing","The story line had so much potential but was a jerky, choppy, rush through a dozen story lines. Too bad the author did not take time to explore each character and their story line more thoroughly. It was unbelievable and unrealistic right from the beginning for the female, and I'm sure, male readers. For the heroine to have been brutally raped within the first few pages then enjoying fantastic sex with her ""soul mate"" within hours made me want to puke. I continued to read the book hoping that it would have some redeeming qualities and due to the fact I was stuck at the airport. Otherwise I would have fed it to the closest trashcan. Folks don't waste your time or money. Save it for authors like Sarabande, Cockrell, Harrison, O'Neal and Gear."
1,What were the first words out of that kids mouth?,"Could they have been, I am going to kill you while you sleep? Also, I don't believe that a woman who has been raped will fall into the arms of another man in so little time.This book could have filled the big void that waiting for Mrs. Auel's next book, but it didn't."
4,Great performance by Scott Ross,Nothing much to add to what the other reviews have already said.Scott Ross was the first harpsichordist to record all of Scarlatti's sonatas and his performances remain unsurpassed.I have gave 4 stars because sometimes the engineers have miked the harpsichord rather too closely butScott's playing is of 5 star quality.Pieter Jan Belder's complete set on Brilliant Classics is also a 5 star performance although he is sometimes recorded with too much reverb.Overall you really can't go wrong with either version and both will give hours of listening pleasure.
5,The Finest Folk Trio,"A witty live album by the finest folk trio ever. Alex, Lou, and Glenn will have your toes tapping and singing along all day long. Hopefully, we'll see more releases come out on CD (Our Men In San Francisco?) from the classic Limeliters lineup."
4,"Talk about a ""blast from the past""!","This recording is an almost song-for-song replay of the live performance I attended in 1962 or 1963 when The Limeliters performed at Kansas State University. It was great stuff then and it's still great stuff now and is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys folk music. The only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars is that the audio transfer quality isn't quite as good as it could have been. This is a vintage performance that is bound to be enjoyed by all, including those (such as many later generations) who've never had the pleasure of experiencing Lou, Alex & Glen and their unique brand of outstanding musicianship and humor (or in many cases, never even heard of The Limeliters)."
5,A Trip Down Memory Lane,"I ran across this CD and just had to have it. It's as fun now as it was when it came out! My friends and I used to get together every weekend and sing along to folk music. I remember singing Hey, Li Lee Li Lee to this LP. What fun! ""Madeira, M'Dear"" still embarrasses me makes me laugh me after all these years. This album is great and a lot of fun."
5,The Limelighters are Sensational,"This is one of the early Limeliters concerts. The wonderful songs, mixed with Lou's humor, are hypnotic. I also own this album as an LP disc. I now have added it to my iPod. The Limeliters, along with the Kingston Trio, Chad Mitchel Trio and several other amazing folk groups defined the generation of the late 50s and early 60s. These groups followed The Weavers, who inspired all of the above groups. No collection of folk music should be without The Limeliters."
2,Don't bother,I am a big fan of Glenn Yarbourgh (sp?) and hoped this album would highlight his talent. Sorry to say the group as a whole while probably talented has nothing on this CD to make it worthwhile. I Gave it away after one listening.
3,Review of Folk Music,"The handling of this transaction was superb. However, the musical content was very simple, too simple."
5,A Must Have!,"As a 30 year fan of Big Country, this is my favorite concert DVD of theirs, and one of my favorites of all. This is a ""must have"" for Big Country fans. And for anyone that wonders what the so-called ""cult"" label is about (I never considered their music in that way, just great songwriting and recording/performing), watch this and you will understand. RIP Stuart Adamson."
3,DVD does not play in my DVD player,"Beware, this DVD is in PAL format. (European format) It works only on my computer. (I'm in the US) Even on the computer, the video quality is quite poor. But I give 3 stars only because of the quality of the band, BC, and this is a wonderful concert because it's both acoustic and ""loud guitars"". Stay alive."
1,"Poor Quality, BUY OEM!","This engine mount failed after only one day of use. It may look like the OEM Ford equivalent, but it is inferior in its build quality and performance. The hassle of having to remove and reinstall the engine mount is not worth the few dollars you will save by buying this product instead of a quality OEM mount."
5,Great,Great item! Exactly the same as the newer editions so i really recommend buying this editions over the newer ones.
5,Brain Fanatics,"This textbook provides a thorough introduction to the brain, starting from the nerves to actual sensory systems (motor, auditory, visual etc.,). Even though I spent some time reading this book, I was disappointed the professor only referred to it once or twice and relied primarily on lectures to create tests. Besides providing the mechanism behind the flow of information in the brain, its discussion of how injuries to the brain result in certain conditions (visual agnosia, neglect syndrome, amnesia, aphasia etc.,) also helped my understanding of the material a lot. The biggest hurdle is understanding how nerves function, after that everything is more or less memorization."
1,Zero value add,"I personally make a living in the management consulting space. At first appearances, this book looked like it would provide me with some new insight or a least one new technique.Sadly, all this book is able to do is to take common place events in corporate America and create an analogy for them. In fact, the analogies go to the truly ridiculous to fill space towards the end of the book.My suggestion for anyone who is interested in real knowledge, avoid this material. It is clear that there is nothing to offer here.Better Luck Elsewhere,Freitz"
5,Father Like a Tree - A Great Story!,"Father Like a Tree is a wonderful story about life and about love. The story offers ample opportunity for interaction, and my children love acting out the part of the baby birds. The book is beautifully illustrated, and would be a great addition to every child's bookshelf!"
5,Mama loves her babies,"My babies loved the story and illustrations so much we purchased several to give as birthday and holiday gifts to our friends. Each year, we also give a book to our school's library and my children have chosen this as their gift."
2,Not impressed.,"I am astounded at the number of glowing reviews for this book. Found the illustrations poor, baby birds almost scary and the large type font offsetting. I shared this book immediately with three other teachers and they all had negative reactions. Is it a nice story about raising a family - I guess so but there are many other excellent titles that do a better job. I also felt the title and opening paragraph do not coincide with the story told. A title about a mother would be more appropriate. To clarify my postion, I am an elementary librarian and read hundreds of childrens' books a year and was very disappointed in this offering esp. given all the positive reviews."
3,"Atomic Bomb, and huge","This poster is awesome. With that said the only bad thing I have to say about this poster is it's freaking huge. The cheapest mountig shop quoted me $140.00 for a plain black frame with no glass of any kind. If you want to build your own frame and have time to build it, that's the best option for this behemoth. Another option is poster hangers, but for this size of poster, is still quite pricey. Think about mounting before you buy a poster of this size. Mine stayed laid out for weeks until I finally decided to hang it up with several 3m poster tabs which don't look that bad but a frame wouldve been much better."
4,Not Yet Fully Recovered,It has become much more greater than Bone Against Steel which I think is not live up to their reputation. Now that Don Barnes was back and with the support of Jim Peterik(formerly Survivor) they launched another tour de force. Overall impression is they turned back to where they started. 38 Special with southern rock flavor. It is not 80s primetime 38 Special but great rock nonetheless. Just Can't Leave You Alone sounds familiar to me because of Don Barnes vocal. Changed By Love and Shelter Me show excellent talent of songwriting pair Don Barnes and Jim Peterik. Particularly Shelter Me is one that you can never miss. Starting with R/B and gradually turned into dramatic rocker with enhancing chorus at the end. So this album shows 80 percent recopvery of one of the greatest rock bands of 80s. I just look forward to the next one.
3,The right solution ?.,"I don't really know what to think of this album. - It's good, and it's bad. Don Barnes is back (where he belongs) after a million years in no-man's land, and that's good. -But Jeff Carlisi is gone, and that's bad. Carlisi was, and is I guess, simply the best guitarist on this planet. The songs are great as always, although I've detected something very strange: Don Barnes doesn't sound like Don Barnes all the time. What I'm talkin' about ?. -Well, a slight touch of what I label: ""false rock'n'roll"", or ""indie voice"", or whatever you might want to call it, creeps up here and there. The strained and faked hoarseness doesn't become anybody who uses it. Please lose this new-found habit, mr.Barnes; it's way below you. Thanks."
3,Still firing but missing a few bullets.,Always good to hear new music from one of the tightest southern rockers ever. They still tear it up live. This album has some good stuff and some not so good. The song fade to blue is good but glaringly misses Carlisi's soaring guitar. It's great to have Barnes voice 'back where it belongs' but until Carlisi rejoins the band- it will just be a shadow of itself.
4,"This was an ABC ""In Concert"" performance","Blackmore was Pissed because they lost the coin toss with co-headliners Emerson Lake and Palmer and had to go on first, before Dark which detracted from the light show.The destruction of the 80 thousand dollar TV camera nearly caused ABC to stop production of the ""In Concert"" Series.The California Jam was broadcast over 4 successive Fridays on late night ABC."
1,HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY! BUYER BEWARE!!,"I have bootlegs of this show that have picture quality 10 times better than this. I'm NOT exaggerating. This is so painful to watch. It's not simply the quality on each frame either. It appears as if they took out frames - it looks like you're fast forwarding through the video. It's distracting and annoying. It gives me a headache trying to watch this video. I'm particularly amused by the phrase inside this DVD warning people of purchasing bootleg versions, as they might be poorer quality. NOT A CHANCE OF THAT. I haven't seen poorer video quality of this show anywhere. The audio is decent though."
2,"Poor show quality, poor image ... almost aceptable sound","This video ia parody of what DP used to be.. only Blackmore saved that show with the now famous demolition of the amplifiers and his guitars, together with the almost totally destruction of a TV Camera... but the rest is a shame.. maybe Blackmore, Paice and Lord are great musicians, but this time is very little what they did for the band.. not to mention Coverdale/Hughes who really are the weak part of this DVD. Recommended only for die-hard MK III fans."
5,A CLASSIC CONCERT!,"This is an amazing concert. Iv'e seen many many versions of this concert on dvd, and in videos I downloaded. THIS dvd is the best version of this performance. The video quality is pretty good, but the audio is outstanding.I like David Coverdale's voice a lot in this dvd, and Ritchie Blackmore is in top form! He destroys three guitars, and his amp, after delivering solo after solo.If you like Deep Purple, DEFINATLY buy this one!"
1,Deep Purple Live in California,This appeared to be a great concert but the recording in analog back in 1974 was bad and the conversion to DVD made it even worse.
3,Ignore three stars - It's a (5) five star,"I'm editing my review. I discovered if I set the TV to ""VHS"" screen size the video is much better than watching it widescreen.I have 9 DP concert DVD's now, even Paris 85. DP's performance at the California Jam has got to be their best live recorded performance ever."
3,Julio Erreart is right. Image not even close to Japanese VHS,"It's tough to review this DVD. I own the Japanese VHS and the picture is crystal clear as though they were in your back yard. Why is that? Here, on this DVD, it doesnt look like video but looks like film, very strange? The sound is good, but I am just baffled by the image quality. Clearly if you dont have this gig you should buy it, but I don't understand how my video purchased back in 1985 from Japan has perfect image quality as though you were watching it on TV, and this is looks like the equivilent of a sample rate being dropped in the digital realm? Weird. Blackmore is just so cool...even if it isnt his best performance. Now, if only someone could find the whole Castle Dnnington footage of Rainbow in 1980, now that would be incredible!"
4,"Don't ""BURN'' Your Money","This video is the same release as DEEP PURPLE 1974 CALIFORNIA JAM, which is currently selling on Amazon for over $28.00 on Amazon.as far as I can see. It is also recorded in Dolby Digital Stereo encoded to an AC3 bitstream when played through Dolby Digital equiptment sound will be heard from left and right speakers only. Save yourself half the money on buy this DVD instead."
4,Great Classic Concert Rock!,Definition of loud and large - Deep Purple gets it right - well worth it!
4,Amazing performance,"There's something unique in this show. The vibe, the dynamics, the individual performances... everything is captured to perfection here (nevermind the generally poor video quality comparing to today's standards... This was never meant to be released as a DVD!).AS always, unfortunately, Deep Purple left a lot of great songs out of the set list, in order to perform an indulgent and overlong ""Space Truckin"" version, the kind of ""love it or hate it"" thing they did at the time.But it's great. Really, the sniffing of Glenn Hughes is sad... But the voice of the guy and Coverdale's quality are amazing. Paice also is performing at the top of his game and Lord is perfect as always."
3,Another Version But It's Good,"After watching this DVD in comparison against my old VHS bootleg of the same show, I was impressed with the audio but I was more than slightly disappointed in the video.However at $12.99 to $15.00, it is a good value.I would have paid more for a better video transfer.Yes, the footage is over 30 years old but this is from ABC television and not cheap German TV footage. I expected the video to be quite a bit better than my VHS copy and I'm not sure it even matches the quality of my VHS bootleg.The sound quality is excellent and is the main reason to purchase this DVD."
2,"OK, 2.5 stars and that's generous","The infamous Deep Purple at the California Jam, what a great event. If I were to pick either getting this on DVD or CD, I'd go with the CD. The DVD, well the video is really disappointing. First off, the camera work is just frickin' terrible...I mean every time Blackmore solos the camera is at his back. And also Glenn Hughes...I love you Glenn, but man you are annoying here. Both vocally and your in between song banter. Those are my 2 main gripes, but they are big, and really ruin the experiencing watching this. On the plus side, David, Richie and Ian and Jon all sound great and their performance on Mistreated is amazing. Like I mention go with the audio experience on CD where it cuts almost all of the in between song banter and just concentrates on the music."
5,use it all the time,"I have a whole row of cookbooks, but I actually use this one all the time. As a newly married 22 year old my sis gave me a copy, and 14 years later, I still love it. Her white beans with pasta is AWESOME. And her recipes aren't full of crud, like cream o' sludge soup. They only have a few ingredients and they're always the stuff I have on hand. Wish I could find her and tell her thanks for such a great book!"
5,The ONLY way to really get rid of these little nuisances,"The information is presented in an entertaining while very informative way. Quit fighting the same old over-the-counter routine...get this information so you can eliminate these critters for good, and KNOW with complete confidence that it's going to work Greatly. Then you can share what you know with others who you may find, need it as well :O)"
3,"Highlights important things, but also contains some misinformation","This book has a lot of good info, and we're following its plan. One thing that's a little concerning is that it contains some misinformation about some of the chemical products it advises against. It states that Malathion (which we were just prescribed to use, for better or worse) is banned in the US by the FDA. This is not true.[...]Maybe the FDA has been bought by the head lice industry (wouldn't surprise me), but statements like this should be corrected."
5,Great Family Game for all Sports Fans,"My 14 year old son received this game for Christmas. We had one of his football teammate's family over and played this game. First it was the Dad's against the Son's...the Son's won! Then it was the Dads vs Sons vs Moms...the Son's still won but it was quite competitive. They have some questions about sports in the 70's that the Dads did well at, obscure questions like what color was the guy's suspenders in the video clip that the Moms scored well at and then of course all the other current questions that the avid SI & ESPN readers (Sons) dominated. We had a great time and would recommend it to any fellow sports fans!"
1,THIS SUXS DONT BUY IT!!!!!,this cd really suxs beacuse when i went to go but it and i listened to it it is an interview. there is no music on this cd at all! it is a biography on how they made it big and it was boring so dont cheat yourself out of 10 dollas people
3,marine carb,"This is not a direct replacemnt for a quadrajet/spreadbore on a crusader 454 or 350 engine without modifications. The gas fitting is not the same size and you will need an adapter. The throtle bracket will need to be lenghtend 1"" so you need a welder. And last and not least, the right front bolt is impossible to tighten with a wrench. It is under the bowl and even with the linkage removed it sucks."
3,You get what you pay for,"Although I agree with the other reviewers about the price being very reasonable for what you get, you do however still get what you pay for. I also notice the light and steady static when the noise cancelling is turned on, and you do sort of get used to it, but should you have to? Also, I've had my headphones for a year now, and as happens with many cheap headphones, I have lost sound on the right side. If you are in the market for a cheap pair of noise cancelling headphones, I do recommend these. If you want quality or better noise cancelling, go with Bose."
4,Decent Quality,"When powered on a noticable hiss is present in the background. While the noise cancelling part does an adequate job, it's not great. Headphones are very comfortable to wear."
4,Creative Labs HN-505 Collapsible Noise-Canceling Headphones,"Received the headphones the other day and for the low prive AND a [...] rebate, you can't go wrong. It was a good deal."
3,Fit well but NC gives me a headache after a while.,Fit well but NC gives me a headache after a while.ComfortableGood tonal quality.Noise canceling hurts my eardrums after 30mins
