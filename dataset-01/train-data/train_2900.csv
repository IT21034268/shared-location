2,"May be a fun game for some, but parents please use caution!","I personally don't find games of this nature that fun, but there are some that do, so ok. I would just like to emphasize that this game should be for older teens and adults only! Parents please use caution when buying this game for your children. It is one of the most violent games I have ever seen and certain elements of it make me cringe and I'm 20 years old! The thought of young children playing this game makes me very sad and worried."
2,Could be better,"When i first heard about this game i was pumped. I thought this was gonna be the best game for the PS2, probably like alot of other people who are thinking about buying this game, but its not even close. Maybe for the first few days was this game fun, yeah it was violent, but come on, its not real. The reckless killing of pedestrians and criminals alike quickly grows boring and there doesnt seem to be much if any real plot. So drivin around the city gets very repetitive and it loses almost all of its fun. It could have been better in many ways, by having a better plot, more interactions with pedestrians, (there was virtually no interaction with the people on the street) and a multiplayer would have made this a 5 star game all on its own."
1,They said that...,"Was really a good game. My disc was too scratched and my Ps 2 cannot load it. So, no way to enjoy it..."
4,terrible worst game ever !!!!!!!!,this game is a must have. The best game ever hands down. You get to kill do illigel stuff. ROCK ON It gets boring after a little while thogh. Like after you beat it.
2,Not a big fan of language,Not a big fan of all the language and violence. My sons really wanted it but I reallly dont care for them to play it even though theyh are teens.
5,I'm real :),The seller did good. I'm just mad that this game is old. The graphics suck. But that's a whole nother story -_- it's still a good game though. No scratches. And it's amazing -_-
5,"What Zelda and Mario were to the 80's,this game is now...","What more can I say than what's in the topic? This game is not only fun on so many levels, but is so innovative, unique, and ground breaking that it has set a standard for excellence and is the genesis of a type of raw, realistic, creative, fun gaming. In short, this is the first game of the next generation of video games, just as Zelda and Mario were on Nintendo in the 80's. As a matter of fact, I do believe this game goes beyond being just a video game. In graphics, sound, concept...in every way, this game is an innovative piece of electronic art.I cannot recommend this game enough."
5,A Review/Rant,"This review is aimed at all the people that said GTA3 was bad because of the violent content, and because ""the point of the game is to kill innocent people"" come on now. are you oblivious to the story line?! did you honestly kill people till you got bored? and about the violence, it has a mature...rating!...in my opinion this game has more freedom than any game ive played, except maybe the sims, you can run around doin missions, or jobs like the taxi and stuff. most of the time when i play, i just get a car, kill everything in my way, and evade the cops. its just so unique, and open, your own storylines build up as you play. its my favorite game, and i bet you will like it. (...)"
5,This......game........ROCKS!!!!,"I cannot describe how much fun this game is. I've been playing it for about 3 weeks now and cannot get enough of it. After a day of crap at work, it is a blast to come home, get in the tank, and commence TOTAL CARNAGE, but usually I try to complete the missions as required. I could have spent twice the money I did getting this game and still been satisfied. Try it...you will not be sorry (unless your under 18 and your parents catch you)."
5,Grand Theft Fun,GTA3 is one of the big suprise games this year.The first two games were [not as good] with poor graphics and shallow gameplay.The third installment of the GTA series is just the opposite with good graphics and great gameplay.When I rented it I thought it would be a waste of money but it was just the opposite.GTA3 is one of the best games this year and I am definately going to buy it soon.
1,Pure filth,"This game is not suitable for children under the age of 17, yet so many children are playing it. I think this game should be banned. This game has horrible language,strippers,and you can kill innocent people. YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR CHILD!"
1,Do NOT buy this game,"I would totally NOT recommend that you buy this game it is absolutly mind blowing, no game should contain prostitution!DO NOT waste your money."
1,"Childish, boring and repetitive!","I bought and played this game since it was so hyped up. I made it through many missions and the game's boring! If you fail a mission, you have to go through the same steps again. Stealing cars and seducing women is fun for only so long! No replay value."
5,A terrific game. PERIOD.,"First off, this game is NOT for the queasy, faint of heart, or the easily offended. If any of those is you, I suggest you go buy Metal Gear Solid 2 (another great game). Now, for the rest of you, this is a must have. Ever come home from work angry? Why not kill a few people lol :-)This game is sooo good. I don't know whats more fun: playing the missions or running around creating havok. It has terrific weapons including a pistol, a bat, flame thrower, missle launcher, machine guns and even a tank! Pick this game up and you won't be disappointed!"
4,Ground-breaking entertainment,"This is a rare game that seems to utilize the full power of the PS2. I am amazed at how far they come since the first GTA, a ground-breaking game in itself for its time. The graphics are outstanding, gameplay is smooth and non-linear, so instead of marching right off to the next mission, you can heist some more cars, make some jumps, steal a taxi and collect fares, beat up some unsuspecting pedestrians, whatever you want; the missions will wait for you. It can be bloody and violent, so it has earned its rating, but for the mature crowd that knows right from wrong and views this as escapist entertainment, it is a fabulous game."
5,PS2's best game yet !!!!!,"This is the best game for PS2 so far. It is much better than the last two. No more overhead view like the other two. Better weapons (sniper rifles, bats, machine guns, and more). More cars (ambulances, police cars, fire trucks, limos, buses) plus boats, planes, helicopters, trains, subways. BUY THIS GAME."
5,"way too violent, but irresistibly FUN","Joe Liberman would HATE this game, and he would have good reason to. But I love it. Everything about this game is great. Whether you are on a mission or just roaming around looking for trouble, this game will keep you entertained. But be forewarned, it is not for the faint-hearted. Not only is this game a blast to play, it reminds us that we live in a free country. Only in a democracy would a game like this be allowed. To be sensible though, I would not reccomend this game to anyone under 18, but they still have a right to play it. To wrap up, this game is a must have for action lovers."
3,grand theft auto,I liked playing this game. You can choose any car to drive. You can put in cheat codes to get different vehicles. The thing that is not good is killing people. Even with the bad things this is still the coolest game I have ever played.
5,I didn't like GTA and GTA2 but...,"its third sequel rocks! I didn't like the first and the second because their 2d graphics and their simple and boring gameplay but in GTA3 you have so much things todo, it's never boring. Graphics and gameplay get four star, the sound and value get five.A MUST HAVE FOR GAMERS!"
5,DYNO-MYTE!,"This game is nuts, absolutely nuts! I love it! I wasn't the biggest fan of the earilier titles in this series, but this is something else, let me tell ya! The 3 city sections are absolutely huge! You'll get to the point where you know the streets as well as those of your own hometown. Plenty to do, plenty. The only complaint I have is that you cannot enter any of the buildings. They could have created a few generic convienence store interiors or something. It'd be great to be able to hold up a 7-11 or a liquor store or something. Other than that, hours upon hours of fun. Get out there and buy this now, assuming you're of age that is."
5,Da bestest game in ze world!!,"If u like hijacking cars,going VERY fast,and getting the cops and military chasing u,this is the game 4 u! At first it diddn't look very fun. but then my dad got it and i played it. i coudn't tear myself away from it.U DO need a memory card 2 save"
5,"A great movie, probably more so for Kitano fans","I took this movie on the shelf one day even though I had never heard of it, only to discover how great it was.I've never been that big a fan of Takeshi Kitano, but I have to say that Kid's Return is a great movie and in my opinion his best. It's very funny, especially in the beginning and has a great score. It seems like most movies involving boxing never fail."
4,Nice!,This was one of the biggest feuds in wrestling both on screen and behind the scenes when I was into professional wrestling. It is a great dvd set.
5,Warrior & Hogan,"I have seen bits and pieces of this and it looks great but I'm writing just to get an idea out there. How about a WWE Rivalries: Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan shoot interview such as this one.Just saying, I think it would be a big seller. I know they only wrestled twice but the longterm rivalry is really big and I think a lot of older wrestling fans would love it.WWE please look into this."
3,[...],"Great DVD Best rivalry of the decade as far as i am concern, ranks 3rd on my list. the 2nd being McMahon vs Austin & of course who can forget Hogan vs Andre as my top pick of all time."
5,documentary made it worth it.,"I bought this DVD with hopefully a little more insight into the 2 greatest wrestlers of all time imo. It was more than worth it. Just to see the emotion made it worth it. The minor qualms I do have wasn't with the actual contents of the DVD, but the condition the DVD was received in. Disc 2 was missing the holder to keep the disc in place and therefore has a very noticeable scratch that makes me miss out on one of the matches but what can ya do? Definitely worth the purchase nonetheless."
4,High class salad spinner,Very nice salad spinner and you can use this to serve the salad in as well. It should be really nice for the price.
4,nice salad spinner,"This salad spinner makes washing greens much, much easier now. I wash, strain, then spin in the same bowl. It gets my greens mostly dry; the grippy foot at the bottom is a helpful design. I prefer the look and durability of stainless steel over the all clear plastic one. I figure if I broke the plastic somehow, I would at least be left with a stainless steel bowl. Recommended."
2,fancy but defect,"this item came in really nice packaging and looks really well made.however, the handle presser keeps on getting stuck.i assume this as a defect."
1,junk,I bought this item after the two dollar version I had for 10 years broke. This salad spinner did not dry my lettuce well and broke after using 10 times. Very dissapointed.
5,top of the line salad spinner,my wife loves this salad spinner. she says it works great and not worried about breaking it as what happened to the plastic one she purchased from the local wal mart. highly recommend this product.
3,Fix OXO Salad Spinner - Push down mechanism sticks,"Do Not Pry!1. Hold the inside center piece and turn the cover until it stops, turn a little more 'till you hear a click, and the pusher part will come out.2. If the pusher part is now off center to the lid and a little sticky: Hold the pusher part and turn the lid until it stops, turn a little more 'till you hear a click, and the pusher will again be centered and free from sticking.3. In future operation, swear off holding the pusher part and helping it by twisting. Simply push it.5 stars if it doesn't stick again with only pushing!"
1,"Poorlymade, breaks easily","So, we are on our third one of these, and it also broke after a few uses. The plastic shell is thin and brittle. The first one broke where the inner spinner mechanism meets the top. The second and third cracked across the top during use. Not sure what to replace it with, but I will definitely look elsewhere."
1,Don't Buy,"It broke beyond repair the third time using it. The plastic part of the spinning mechanism snapped. Great company, but this product is worse than cheap salad spinners that look terrible but last decades. Pass on this one."
5,nice large metal spinner,"I had plastic oxo spinner for about 4 years, but it broke recently - plastic bowl cracked after I washed it in dishwasher a few times and inner basket became warped from the heat of the dishwasher. SO I wanted something more sturdy, since I use spinner almost every day. I put handful of salt and baking soda into spinner, add water and soak my salad (or fruits, or berries) in it for about 5 minutes to remove dirt from plant pores. Than I rinse 2-3 times with water, and spin salad (no need to spin fruits or berries). And Voila! clean stuff! I have my metal spinner for 3 weeks now, works good. I will not put it in dishwasher again. Also I am trying to press gently on the spinner mechanism to not brake it. Unfortunately spinning top from my old plastic spinner does not fit to metal model, or I would have backup. But in case if my spinning top will brake I can buy OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner for $30 to replace top (it fits, I checked)."
1,"Cheaper than original, broke in just a few uses.","I had a plastic version of this for many years and it worked great. I broke it and it was my fault. I had no problem purchasing a second one and I thought the steel version would be an upgrade. I was wrong. They changed the plastic spinner top to a much cheaper non-flexible plastic. It broke the same way the other reviewers said theirs broke. This is not the same quality product I purchased before, do not buy this item. I wouldn't buy the smaller one either, it has the same lightweight plastic non-flexible lid."
1,Save your money,"I bought this spinner believing it would last longer than the plastic one I previously purchased, but it is poorly constructed. The spring mechanism used to ""pump"" the spinner broke after only two uses, rendering it completely useless. It seems to me the majority of the fabrication cost goes towards the stainless steel bowl, with only a few pennies for the functional parts of the spinner."
5,Oxo Steel little salad spinner,This is such a great product. I used to have the plastic version and I broke it. I was so glad when they made it in steel. It is easy to clean and very durable.
1,Disappointing for an OXO item,I have to agree with the negative reviews on this product although I love the OXO line of products. I had an all plastic version of this spinner for many years and when I renovated my kitchen I thought I would treat myself to the stainless steel version. The plunger part broke within 3 months. I thought it was a fluke or that maybe I was pushing too hard so I bought another to replace it. The new one broke within 3 months. When I looked online I found that its a common complaint with the stainless steel version. I'm kind of bummed; 2 x $50= I blew $100 on salad spinners in 6 months!
4,"Oxo steel little salad spinner - good product, great customer service","I've used a large plastic version of this salad spinner for years. About a year ago, I treated myself to the smaller version in stainless. It's great for making salad for 2-4 people, and for drying herbs and greens for cooking.Shortly after I got it, the tiny ""oxo"" logo fell out of the central knob on the lid. Apparently, that holds the whole lid mechanism together. An email to the manufacturer was answered almost immediately and they sent a new lid in a few days without a fuss. It's worked fine ever since.Gracious responses like that have become the exception, so despite the original problem, I can recommend both the product and the Oxo customer service policy."
4,Space-saving & handy salad spinner,"Having limited storage space, this little helper was just the right size for our kitchen (and for the two of us). Love the stainless steel, and it's pretty easy to operate. Spins well but don't expect your greens, herbs, or berries to be totally free of water. Because of it's small size, it's probably best-suited for use by a family of 2 (maybe 3 if you prefer small side salads)."
4,OXO will replace the bowl!,"Just called OXO (1-800-545-4411) and ordered a replacement bowl- for the plastic spinner, not the stainless. $9.59 including shipping.Great salad spinner, btw."
4,does the job,"This is my first time using a Salad spinner, works like it is stated in the information and it is easy to use."
5,A great improvement on the humble salad spinner!,"Stainless, not plastic, but the strainer is still plastic.Quick and effective. Easy to clean and stays looking good.Clear top means you can see it's clean inside.A good size for enough salad (or vegetables) to be cleaned, rinsed and dried without mess.Sealed lid is good for avoiding spills.Useful stainless bowl for tossing a salad or preparing other food, vegetables, etc.I was thinking it's a tad expensive, but now it's one of the things we use every day in the kitchen."
4,Works well,I've used this salad spinner for a few weeks and have no issues with it. I love that it has a large bowl which can be used for other tasks as well. It's effective in getting water off the leaves and is easy to clean. The spinning mechanism is smooth.
3,This company can do better,"When OXO came out with their Good Grips line, they made me a customer for life. But this item has been something of a disappointment. I had the plastic version of this spinner and was very satisfied with it, but after a guest mishandled it, I needed a replacement. I thought the steel construction would be a virtue, but it hasn't been for me. Of course, it's a heavier product overall, but it also doesn't seem to have the freedom of movement that the plastic version did. So, in a nutshell, I just can't recommend this product. Sorry, OXO."
3,"Great design, so, so manufacture.","We are big on salads. This model got a good workout and after 12 months the bowl cracked. Glued the bowl and the lid mechanism gave out shortly thereafter. Upgraded to the steel bowl model--thought it might be sturdier than plastic, and it is. The spinner mechanism failed after less than a week and I returned the lid to OXO. They sent me a whole new unit, so now I've got two sturdy steel bowls! Unfortunately, the spinner has now failed again, but after almost two years of fairly heavy use. We'll gladly get another because the thing really does its job beautifully. Now, if only the spinner would match up with the bowls.............. The bowls do make excellent mixing bowls."
2,salad spinner,This salad spinner is a little disappointing as lacks efficiency: the salad remains quite wet. The spinning lack speed. I like the steel part though.
1,beautiful but tempermental,"OXO makes great kitchen products but this one seems to have a production flaw in some of its spinners. The pump mechanism breaks/strips after just a few months of use. Bummer, because this is an expensive gadget. The serving bowl is lovely and the basket is fine, it's just the lid with the pump mechanism that fails for some customers. I want to emphasize SOME because there are some very fine reviews of this product also.OXO customer service was very helpful and offered to send us a replacement lid at no charge. It is nice to do business with such a reputable company like OXO. Let's hope they review their production of this product."
3,Deceptive Labeling,"We've owned OXO Salad Spinners for years but decided to upgrade to a stainless steel model. Our thought was that the basket as well as the top would be stainless steel. To our great surprise and disappointment, only the bowl was steel. They may as well call it a rubber salad spinner because there is rubber on the bottom of the bowl. The plastic top cracked, and OXO gave me a hard time about replacing it; and I kept arguing with them that they should stop calling it a steel salad spinner just because 1/3 of it is made of metal. Ultimately, they did replace the top, and we like the way it works. Just don't expect a long-lasting product for your money."
4,Spinning salads and herbs with a stainless steel OXO,"I like OXO products - as a retired engineer I believe they possess fairly good quality - although I have to gain more practical experience about the use of this little salad and herb spinner in my life.Rest assured, however, this little thing can whirl like a ""dervish"". Shipping was ahead of schedule.If you like your salads and herbs spun, this is a good product."
5,5 alarm fire alarm,"This video may look pretty basic when it comes to the production, but the women are unbelievably hot and seem to be genuinely having a lot of fun. In fact, they almost seem to be having more fun than the viewer, if that's possible! Some of them might make you sweat even if they DIDN'T get naked, but (gulp) they do! If you like erotic videos with beautiful nude women, GET THIS!!!!!!!"
2,Thought it was a great deal,The radio worked great for the first year and then for some reason the next year the radio stopped working.
1,Don't waste your money,"Extremely disappointed with this product. Sound quality very poor, even at highest quality setting. Too much background noise - hissing and sounds similar to water trickling in the distance. Dictation quality is okay, but overall quality should be much higher for a product of this price.It does come with some interesting software speech to text and translation. Perhaps the inclusion of this is what inflates the price, but Panasonic should focus more on greatly improving the quality of the voice recorder in the areas of sound quality and feel (cheap, lightweight plastic.I ended up buying the Olympus DS-40. It has a similar price, sound quality is far superior, and the overall appearance is much better."
3,Needs to be Mac. compatible,The recorder it's self is a nice little unit. The editing software is another story. Panasonic only makes a Windows version. That doesn't help us Mac. users.Is there a warranty on this product. It stopped working two days ago after three weeks use.
5,A great place to start when considering law school!,"This book offers a wonderful base of knowledge for someone who is considering lawschool who has little to no pre-law experience (e.g. someone with an English or History degree). It gives the reader a good sense of understanding of the legal system with easy to understand definitions and examples. Through the use of one particular legal issue, and the help of several different case examples, the author enables the reader to see the legal process as it goes forward and backwards through the court system.You finish this book with a much clearer understanding of what to expect from law school, from casebooks to exams, and what you may be able to expect in professional lawyer/client setting. It even recommends and illustrates helpful ways to study and make it through that difficult first year. For such a tiny book it covers and enormous distance from start to finish. I highly recommend it."
3,Overstated title,"This would be better titled something like--A Taste What You Can Expect in a Very Limited Way From Law School. Respectably done, but slight. And compared with the personable narrative voices of other law prep books, notably, 1 L of a Ride, Law School Confidential, and Getting to Maybe, Ms. Nygren's style is quite dry."
2,A Disapointment,Unfortunately this pump has been a disappointment. None of the included nozzles form a tight seal with my bike tires meaning it is impossible to get much air into the tires. It is good enough in an emergency to get the bike home but otherwise it is a pain.
5,Intriguing,Loved yet another in the Alex Cross novels. I always wonder and am still wondering why Patteson starts new chapters so often.
4,Not much difference,"Most all of these drip system end closures have the same problem. If your water pressure is high, the pressure blows off the end closure on your 1/4 inch end closure. I must admit, these seem to be a bit better, and will take a lot more pressure before blowing off. That saves me literally hours of work, finding out where my leak is, and then fixing it with a new closure. So they are a little better."
1,very disappointed,So much for 'going green.' The second time my husband used this bottle he discovered rust on the inside around the mouth piece. I am planning to return it for a full refund.
3,Good bottle for the price,This is a good little bottle. It fits in the drink holder nicely and is a good size. The cap isn't the greatest. It feels a little cheesy and doesn't always seal tight. As long as you keep it upright it's ok. I bought 2 of these and the lid is the same on both. Certainly a less expensive option than other stainless bottles on the market. I can live with the lid but YMMV
5,Great and reliable.,"I have difficulty understanding the negative reviews here. After observing someone using this bottle for close to a year without any complaints, I finally got my own. I am incredibly happy with it and have no complaints. The water tastes great and the bottle is quite light. Some reviewers complain that the paint chips off. However, it explicitly says in the instructions to not put the bottle into a dishwasher. If you are mindful, there should not be any problems."
3,NO ICE,"THE MOUTH OF THIS BOTTLE IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT REGULAR ICE IN THE BOTTLE. OTHER WISE THE BOTTLE IS GOOD. IF YOU LIKE LUKE COLD TAP WATER, IF YOU WANT ICE IN THE BOTTLE BUY A KLEEN KANTEN BOTTLE."
1,Don't Buy,"I have never written a review of a product before, but felt compelled to write one after ordering two of these bottles off Amazon. When you screw the black plastic cap on or off, the plastic comes off the cap and floats in the water inside the bottle. Unless you like drinking small bits of plastic, I would not recommend buying this bottle. We did not have this problem with the Sigg bottles we ordered."
1,Bad Idea,The bottle is brand new and already leaks. The seal doesn't work and if you put carbonated liquid in the bottle it makes a bubbling noise! Terrible! Don't buy this.
3,bad cap,I like the idea of getting away from the plastic bottles and this is lightweight and in lots of nice colors. The negative to this design is the cap is hard to fasten and can leak if it's not on perfectly. Hopefully they will redesign the caps and then it would be a perfect bottle.
2,Plastic Cap is poorly designed,"The plastic caps for these bottles are poorly designed. Probably the manufacture did it on purpose so they can make more money on customers who need to buy extra caps to keep their bottles. The plastic cap threads are not properly made so it would not be thighten or losen smoothly. Then the threads are tripped easily. So you not only have to buy a new cap to keep the bottle, but also swallow the stripped plastic in the water."
3,stainless steel bottle,nice size ss bottle for general use. but they use a plastic cap with fine threads so you must be careful not to cross thread. One of the 5 bottles I received had bad threads and is very hard not to cross thread wear as the others are not as bad but could be a problem in the future. The 40 oz bottle uses stainless cap with large threads which I think is the only way to go after comparison.UPDATE: After 1 yr. we don't use these bottles any more. The threads are shot and bottle painted colors are peeling. Don't waste your money. Buy Klean Kanteen with large threaded cap. Cost more but much better prod.good luck!
1,Bottle leaked,I bought two of these. One started leaking from the base within a week and the lid didn't fit properly on the other.
2,leaky bottle,"The bottle looks cool, but it takes about 10 turns just to open and close the bottle and it leaks. The paint is starting to come off of mine too. I didn't realize at the time that I bought it, but stainless steel sweats pretty bad too. If I had known these things, I would have chosen a plain silver bottle with a different type of top."
2,Not as good as their other bottles,"I bought two of these earlier this summer for my wife to get away from more plastic since she was pregnant. The bottles work fine. The seals are great and we never had leaks, but the caps were VERY easy to cross thread. One of the two I ordered actually came cross-threaded and I had to send it back. Amazon was amazing and we had a new one very quickly.The cross-threading issue continued tho and every so often I'd find a sliver of black plastic in my bottle(or my mouth). This was very unsettling so we ordered some of the bottles(also by New Wave) that have the large threads(a la kleen kanteen).New Wave Enviro Stainless Steel Water Bottle (1-Liter)We LOVE these and have been using them since. The others are sitting in our cupboard, waiting for the next garage sale."
3,It leaks.,I have pretty much the same complaints everyone else has:1.) It leaks. Turn it upside down and watch the droplets come out.2.) Carabiner hooked to the top makes it difficult to unscrew cap.3.) Slight metallic taste to the water.
2,Not easy to use,"While it holds water well, it's a pain to get it open and closed. The screw top doesn't easily screw back in and I found myself spending too much time getting closed. It now sits on my counter, unused. I recently purchased NALGENE bottle, which is a plastic BPA FREE bottle, and I LOVE it! I would recommend it over this one."
1,Bad Customer Service,"One of the bottles I bought had several thin, curled metal shavings inside it. I tried phoning the company during business hours, and was sent into an endless maze of voicemail that eventually hung up on me. I tried again on another day, thinking I would get a live person and ended up in the same situation. Finally I emailed the company and got this response: We will notify the manufacturer.No offer of reimbursement or even an apology for sending out what could have been a potentially dangerous product.Thankfully, Amazon refunded my money.I would not recommend buying from this company-spend your money at a place that is more consumer-friendly.Update:I got a comment that this forum is to comment on the product, not the service-To me, the company that makes the product is responsible not only for their product, but their customer service. So I stand by my review. Bad product-Bad service."
3,Better in winter!,"We decided to try these bottles on a hot day. Big mistake. I guess since metal is such a good conductor of heat, the water warmed up very quickly. I tried adding crushed ice to the water but it really didn't make much of a difference. I'll save them for use during the winter months."
3,Could be improved,"For the most part, this is a great water bottle. The biggest problem is that the cap has to be screwed on REALLY tightly to keep it from leaking - I'm worried that with normal wear and tear on the seal, I won't be able to close it tightly enough to keep it from leaking. I've used a Sigg before and it's much higher quality."
1,Cheaply made buy a Sigg instead,"You are paying for what you get. The screw top is made from cheap plastic, the threads are very easily damaged if you are not careful when screwing the lid on. The paint chips easily and the little carabiner is worthless.Bottom line, by a Sigg brand aluminum bottle, they're a little more expensive but they are top quality."
3,Tops hard to align to screw on.,The only problem with this bottle is that the taping on the top is hard to line up properly to screw it on. I have a hard time with it and my kids can't do it at all. Otherwise it's a great product. No metal or plastic taste in the water. And the loop on the top is handy for attaching to it to things when carrying a lot of stuff.
1,Tight Threads Leave One Drinking Plastic,"The threads on this bottle are entirely too fine and not carefully crafted. No matter how carefully I thread the cap I end up with very fine slivers of the plastic cap floating in my water. So, instead of chemicals leaching from my plastic bottle into my water, I can consume the plastic directly.The bottle cap design also makes it rather slow and tedious to replace the cap without thoroughly shredding the plastic threads."
4,Wouldn't give it to someone with low patience. :-),"I like this bottle; the size is just what I needed, and the color is durable. I think this type of finish is preferable to the opaque paint-type finishes you see out there. My only (and small) complaint is that most times, the lid does not want to thread correctly; you have to slowly and patiently turn the cap. Not good for someone who doesn't have the patience to do that every time. I just get the feeling that the plastic that the cap is made of would not be able to handle multiple incorrect threadings. Maybe it could, but I like the bottle so much I am not willing to take the chance."
5,WATER BOTTLE,"I find it ideal for my purposes, am happy with the quality of service and the merchandise. I have 'retired' my old, plastic bottle and am pleased to be going 'green'!"
4,"Cold Drinks, Safe Water, Annoying Cap","I like the size of this bottle and that it keeps our drinks cold. You can freeze it for a little bit before you go out, too. The hole is too small to fit ice cubes in easily. I have to push each one through by running water over it at the same time. The cap is a PAIN, especially at the gym when you're really thirsty. It's hard to twist the cap on and off while you're on a treadmill or elliptical machine. At least the water is safe and you're not drinking out of a plastic bottle. This is much healthier for you and of course, we use filtered water in ours."
3,Water Bottle,"The mouth of this bottle is small, so it is hard to clean the inside of it, but it does keep drinks cool."
5,best I've had,"Good value, wonderful colors, easy to drink out of and I have experienced no leaking. I would definitely buy them again."
2,Leaks and tricky to use,"I ordered 4 of these. One leaked right from the beginning, as soon as I loosened the top the water just flowed out of a tiny hole in the bottom. The others are OK, but the tops tend to get cross threaded and the color comes off very easily when scratched."
2,Stainless steel water bottle,"I like the bottle because it is stainless steel, however I have only had the bottle a few weeks and the paint on the bottle is chipping already. Before I purchased the bottle I read the reviews and the suggestions to avoid this, and followed ALL the sugestions. I don't understand why the paint is chipping because I have NEVER placed it in a dishwasher or dropped it. Lastly, the bottle leaks no matter how tight the cap is, so I'm not sure what that is about."
3,"good quality, doesn't leak, but be careful with threads","Preferring stainless or glass for supposed health risks of plastic and aluminum I purchased this drink bottle and use it often. The plastic top has not significantly leaked, but you need to carefully screw it on since the threads are not too deep - you could strip them if not careful. My only objection to this product is that it was made in China. I did not know that before I bought it. Not that I fear Chinese stainless steel, but I have tried to boycott China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre."
1,no good water bottle,The top is sharp where a person would drink from. The water smells moldy if left overnight. And the paint chips in the dishwasher.
5,Great Water Bottle!!!,"Love these water bottles, bought 8 of them. Water taste great, flows out smoothly and best of all does not leak."
2,LLB,broke out the bottom when I froze the water. Paint comes off real easy and the lid is a pain to get off.
2,Funky Flavor,"I bought one of these through my school bookstore since i was looking to replace my plastic eddie bauer bottles. Boy does thing make water taste funky. its really quite bad and for an avid water drinker like me, its a crime. It bends out of shape real easy although a good two or three wacks with a hammer should work. Paint comes off very easily. It is stainless steel which is good and it keeps water nice and cold (+1 star). It is also cheap (+1 star)I'm going to go with a klean kanteen instead."
3,Not bad but still looking for better,"I've had this water bottle for a few months now. I wasn't using it a lot because I've heard mixed opinions on whether its material is completely safe/better than plastic. Also, I think it's hard to wash with the tiny opening and the lid is difficult to screw on and off and sometimes takes a couple tries to line it up properly. I've been washing it in the dishwasher (about 4-5 times now) and the paint is chipping and there are a few small dents. The water tastes clean as far as I can tell though I never drink it after more than a few hours. It hasn't leaked. It works but I'm still looking for something better."
1,After a year or so the bottle started to smell like dirt.,"For the first year the bottle was fine, no problems. But so far 2 or the 4 I bought I have had to throw away because they started to smell like dirt which made the water smell and taste that way also. I tried soap, baking soda, and vinegar with no success to get rid of the smell. They say they are stainless but I do not think that should happen if that was the case. Not to mention the paint chippings."
1,its ok but not worth the money,"I had this for a few days and the paint is peeling of already. guess the brushed metal look was a better choice but i though that ""powder green"" was more my style. the bottle swets a lot when filled with cold water and leaves water rings on the table counter. last night it left a lot of paint on the table. $5.00 would be a better price for this item."
2,You get what you pay for,I bought this bottle after I was unable to find a SIGG bottle. This bottle has a metallic taste. I also do not like the seal between the bottle and the cap. The threads from the cap are already warping and leaving little black pieces on and probably in the watter bottle. I'd recommend SIGG bottles (finally found one) and I also like Klean Kanteen. They are worth the extra money. Both are lighter (my 40 oz Klean Kanteen is lighter than this bottle).
2,"Gorgeous when new, but needs improvement","Like many, I'm trying to transition to stainless, but darn it, this doesn't quite work.Pros:1. The bottle is gorgeous when new.2. Some colors are wonderfully inexpensive at Amazon's current price (less than four dollars).Cons:1. I don't like drinking directly from stainless... it has a taste. (That's not this bottle in particular.)2. So: It needs a sports cap. (They don't make a sports cap for this bottle.)3. I would prefer a wider mouth, for easier cleaning.Note: To preserve that pretty color, don't put it in the dishwasher. The metal and the coating are likely to expand and different rates and you will lose the coating."
3,Blue Bottle,"I wasn't very satisfied product because it was poorly made even for the amount that was paid for it. The cap was of very light plastic, the rim of the bottle was very sharp for a person's mouth. The bottle itself was dented and had discoloration at random places. the clip that came with it was very faulty and improperly made."
1,Bad top,"The top to this bottle is cheap and does not seat well. Each time I put the top on, the threads don't match up and it needs to be reseated. It is very annoying. The mouth of the bottle is also poorly built - its rather rough/sharp and I'm always worried about cutting my lip on it.I do not recommend this product."
1,Not that great,I am disappointed in the product. The screw top lid does not go on easily and the water bottle gives the water a metal taste. I would not reccommend this product at all..............
2,Paint is chipping after the first week...,"I bought this after losing a very expensive Sigg bottle, hoping that the quality would be comparable. The paint chipped after the first week of use, and i'm not very tough on these bottles. I guess I'd rather spend twice as much for the durability of a Sigg."
2,Good for the price --> Cheap,"Not a great product. Plastic lid looses threads, and my mustache hairs get stuck in the ""ring""."
4,"Great product, one had a defect","I bought 3 of these. I really like them because they are stainless steel and not plastic, they fit in the drink holder in the car. good size, not to big or too small. fun colors. out of the 3 I bought, the neck of one is messed up somehow so that the screw top doesn't screw in nice and clean, it's sticky and kind of shreds the plastic cap as it goes in. Other than that, nice product."
3,"It works, but costmetically it gets worn very quickly.","I purchased the item at the beginning of April 2009. It works just fine for the purpose that I intended it for, which was to hold water.I didn't need the hiking clip on the lid, so I took it off.I first noticed the wear on the item about 2 weeks after using it. The color on the bottom started chipping away. When I first washed it, I washed it by hand. The second time I washed it I put it in the dishwasher. Big mistake! I should have known better, but I wanted to sterilize it. That is when the color started chipping away in bigger chunks and it wasn't just at the bottom, but along the top.Needless to say, the item still works, but cosmetically it is ruined and I don't want to be seen in public with it. Also, I've only used it for water and it gets a slight metal taste after a while.I should have listened to the other reviewers, but I wanted to try it for myself. I will be shopping for a better product in the next couple of days. Hope this helps."
3,Weird taste,"The bottle arrived to me scrapped on the side, but still functional. It is very handy, however it has this weird taste when you drink from it. I think it's because of the rubber screw top. Other than that, it works just fine."
2,Could be better,I bought 3. One of the them started leaking after a few weeks. The cap on another one stopped screwing in without coming loose. But I switched caps and they work fine now.
1,Not satisfied,"I'm not happy with this bottle, or the other 2 just like it. First, it was difficult to wash in order to get rid of the steel taste. The first few times we used them our drinks tasted like pennies. Second, after just 2 washings, the paint started to peel. Third, i've already had to get rid of one because the cover started leaking after only 3 weeks of use. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the product."
1,Disappointed,"I bought three of these water bottles for my family for Christmas because they were inexpensive, bright colors and stainless steel. Within a week the paint on the bottles had begun to flake off, and the caps no longer screwed on and sealed properly. I will be sticking with other brands of stainless water bottles, that may cost more initially, but are more cost effective in the long run!"
1,new wave enviro,"yes, the price is right... if you want crap. it's worth the extra $10 investment to get a bottle with a metal cap. I am still finding tiny fragments of the soft plastic cap floating around in my water, and I've been using the bottle for over 2 weeks! Also, there is a problem with the ring inside the mouth piece. Not only does stuff get stuck in there, making cleaning difficult, but the cap has to be perfectly aligned to screw on, otherwise it will just send the ring spinnin round and round, the cap loosin plastic as it goes. Stainless steel is definitely the way to go,so for that I gave this product one star. Very disappointed."
1,Spend the extra money,This bottle is cheaper than the price you pay for it. It is really not worth it. Within 5 uses of the bottle the threads for the cap have already stripped out and I refuse to spend 4 more dollars to buy a new one. There are much higher quality metal bottles for only a few bucks more!
1,"okay, but...","I bought three of these bottles because they were inexpensive and looked cool, and it seemed like a good idea to stop using the disposable plastic water bottles.But they seem cheap. The bright colored paint started to peel off after a couple weeks. I did not get a response from the company when I emailed a request for information about lead in the paint.After a few hours in the bottle, the water started to have a metallic taste.But they did get me accustomed to the idea of carrying around my own water bottle, so I did a little more research and bought the more expensive ones by Sigg. The Sigg aluminum bottles have a flexible ceramic coating on the inside, so there is no metallic taste, even after several days.So, while the Enviro bottles are cheap and seem okay for limited use, I highly recommend spending a bit more and buying the much better quality Sigg bottle."
1,Does Not Last,"I loved this water bottle when I first got it and I used it all the time. I was able to put it in my bag and I never worried about it leaking. However, after just three months of constant use, the bottle began to fall apart. The blue paint began to wear away, the cap no longer screws on (the stainless steel wore away a lot of the plastic), and the clip on the top of the bottle broke. If you need a leak-proof bottle that holds up with constant use, this is not the one for you."
3,Great idea but cap doesn't fit well,"I recently purchased this bottle at a local health food store to replace my heavy glass bottles that I use for drinking water. Three negatives I've found with this bottle:1) I've heard that stainless steel is as light as plastic but I haven't found this to be the case. Stainless is safer than glass where breakage is concerned but not lighter when filled with liquid.2) The cap on the bottle is made of plastic and the inside threads of the bottle are stainless. Needless to say, they don't fit well together and so it leaks.3) The cap has a carabiner attached which makes it awkward to turn. It would be much easier if the carabiner and ring were attached to the bottle rather than the cap.Although stainless steel is an excellent alternative to plastic and safer than glass, I'm going to return this bottle and look for a different design."
1,Stainless Steel Water Bottle - Bronze,"Within the first week of use the ""Bronze"" coding on the outside of the bottle started to scratch off. But, more troubling is the lit....it doesn't lock into place to seal properly. The threads catch, but right when you crank it down one last turn to ensure it's closed, it goes completely off track and loosens up. Final words...weak lid with a crappy paint job. DON'T LET THE LABEL FOOL YOU, AS IT DID ME.....ENVIRO PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN CHINA. WHO'S ENVIRONMENT ARE THEY GOOD FOR?? I'm calling the company."
3,Good price for decent product,"This is a no-frills bottle for a good price. I recommend the non-tinted bottle, as other reviews have commented on the paint chipping over time."
1,Horrible bottle and even worse customer service!,"The bottom of my bottle separated from the sides after two months of use. I brought this to the attention of the company and at first they ignored me, then told me it was my fault. I'll NEVER buy from them again!"
2,peeling paint,"Looks like other people have experienced the same thing - the color started to peel, reducing this very nice looking bottle to cheap junk. I switched to a flip top Nalgene that I bought at the grocery store and am very happy with that. I would not recommend this product for all the reasons that others have listed: cheap cap, peeling finish. Unfortunately at the time I bought mine there weren't this many reviews warning me about what I would get. Oh well."
1,Didn't Like,"Didn't like the water bottle, my 10yr old son dropped it on the first day of school & the bottom dented & split open."
3,"Good bottle, bad lid.","These bottles are great, I bought one for my wife and one for myself. They keep the water fresh tasting and cool. However, the plastic lids have both stripped rendering the bottles useless. I have not been able to find replacements via the seller's website either.Hopefully there is a place to buy stainless lids that would fit these bottles or maybe somewhere has an ample supply of bad plastic lids that I can keep replacing."
1,Disappointment,I bought this product to eliminate plastic bottles. DOES NOT keep water cold even when I tried adding ice cubes. I'm sorry I bought it. Bought one for a friend and she doesn't like it either. My water stays colder in plastic!!!!!
1,One fatal flaw,"The plastic cap is difficult to open while exercising and worse yet tiny bit of plastic break off and get into your water. Not a well thought out product, I just ended up tossing it before I was tired of little bits of plastic getting in my mouth."
2,"Cap doesn't fit well, Pinches mustache","You have to be very careful to avoid cross threading the cap when screwing it back on. Also, I have a mustache, and the way the inner and outer liners are put together, you can often can a mustache hair caught there. Won't kill me, but it is annoying.Updating review. As others have commented on, mine has started to leak."
2,Bummer... Paint is chipping off and top is hard to put on,"I bought 2 of these (blue & green) and gave one to my mom. Both of them are used differently, but the paint is chipping off from the bottom of both. BUMMER! I was hoping to use this bottle instead of plastic bottles, and it has accomplished that goal, but I'm really disappointed in the fact that the paint is chipping off in less than a month and I constantly struggle with the top. It is still usable, and I never experienced any funny tastes, so at least it's got that going for it. You get what you pay for with this product."
1,Have not had a chance yet to see how my grandson actually does with it,"I had purchased the photo children's book of Klondike and Snow from the Denver Zoo for my grandson 3or 4 years ago, after I was told he showed an interest in polar bears and I had bought him a stuffed polar bear(from Amazon.com I think). Jake is now 6 and still has 'Polee', the(15""?)stuffed polar bear, who has spent many a night in Jake's bed. I was a math major and computer programmer and so have always loved math. I think this book may be too advanced for him at this time, but I feel when he is ready, this has to be the BEST possible presenter of this info to Jake. I was very impressed with the sample pages I saw from the book. I'm going up to Seattle this weekend to see him and hope to check out how he likes it.. and get back to you!"
5,No surprises!,This product fulfills the need to remove an unsightly trashcan from view and clear up my kitchen area for easier traffic flow. It is well constructed and was easy to install.
5,sturdy pull-out trash can,"Wow, love this can! The pull-out design is great and very sturdy. Also fits normal size trash bags and you can stuff them to the top with trash. This is definitely a must-have."
5,Just ordered my second one,"We've owned the Simple Human under counter pull out trash can for over two years and it works just as great today as the day we installed it. The roller bearings are super smooth, the strength of the unit is rock solid as well. Now that we moved to a single sort recycling setup I just ordered a second one to install in a different drawer."
4,great product,"I have this product for over two years now and it's great. The size is perfect and it easily pulls out and in. The only down side is that the canister can't be removed to be cleaned, so I have to clean around it."
4,Nice way to hide the trash,Provides a nice out-of-the-way area to hide the trash.It's a little high though and just barely fit under our sink pipes.
4,Makes cooking easier by saving steps,"I didn't know what I was missing until I installed one of these handy trash cans under my sink. I had been walking across the kitchen leaving a trail of drips and splatters on the floor! This product takes care of that problem, saves some time, and installed easily and securely. It is sturdy and feels like it will hold up over time and functions like a built-in part of the cabinets. I'd like to see a way of attaching the trash can so it pulls out when you open the cabinet door to make life even easier. A good value for sure."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"Too many under the counter trash pull-outs secure the can only 1/2 way up the bin, and require that you use the bin itself as the ""handle"" to slide it in-and-out from under the counter. Assuming you are 5-6 feet tall, this would inevitably lead to pulling out the bin entirely, leaving the sliding mechanism behind with trash spilling and touching of garbage. Not good.This product solves that problem perfectly. The construction is solid. It holds the trash bin securely. The install is simple. And, the handle ensures the bin comes out from under the counter with the trash in place.Also...I saw some reviews indicating that the mechanism does not pull out far enough, requiring that you angle the trash bin to get it out from under the counter. I did not find this to be the case. I did install the mechanism the minimum 2 inches from the front edge of the cabinet. If I went any deeper that 2"" into the cabinet I could see this might be a problem."
3,Check measurements first!,"I love the Simplehuman brand generally, and this is a good product. However, it's not meant for everyone's kitchen cabinets. While I measured before I bought it and knew it would fit, when I actually placed it inside my cabinets, I realized I was wrong. The hinges make the can taller...1) I can't screw the hinges in, and 2) I have to tilt the can downward to pull it out to change the bag. It's still usable though! So I kept it. It's a good product, just one that's not good for my kitchen in particular."
5,Great Trash Basket,I used this basket to replace a flimsy one I had purchased earlier. Think this one is sturdy and well designed. I really like it!
5,Under sink pull out garbage can-Fabulous!,Heavy duty pull out garbage can with strong attached metal handle. Glides easy to pull out and use. So glad I spent the extra few dollars and bought this model. It's worth it! Now my friends all want this model too. No more backaches and unnecessary bending to pull out fa garbage can.
5,well built,"I have owned others like this, but none work as well. It slides effortlessly, it stays where you leave it, it seems well built... overbuilt! I love it. If I had any complaint, it would be that it does not come out quite far enough. If you have a cabinet with a drawer above it (as most kitched cabinets do), when you pull it out to take out the barrel (ie to change the bag) it does not lift out without some strange angles to clear the drawer face above. This sometimes results in some garbage on the floor if the barrel is too full. another half and inch of range and it would be fine. overall a pleasure."
3,Could be sturdier,"I love the benefit of having the trash under the counter and out of the way, but I have noticed that the frame should be more durable. Mine has already jumped out of the track and had to be adjusted. Now we are just really careful not to put any pressure on the can when we pack down the trash."
5,Hands-Free and Mess-Free Convenience,"In general- SimpleHuman makes great household products! I got a few of their products- and all are awesome!this under-counter pull out garbage can- a must have! It quietly sits in the cabinet under the sink (i used only 4 screws vs 8- less holes! still stable and works great) and whenever I need it- it rolls out! No mess, no fuss! Most of the time i even use my foot , not hand, to pull it out!Very convenient! Installation took no more than 5 min (if you have electric tools)Everything is a matter of personal taste- this product satisfied mine!!!Was totally worth the money"
5,Absolutely perfect,"The illustrations are drop-dead gorgeous but the story really steals the show. My husband and I are always quoting from this one--""and then I'm gonna DRINK SOME BUTTERMILK!"" I love the dialect and the wonderful similies (""like an elevator up a greasy groove""). Can't wait to have kids so I can read it to them."
2,Not sure this is a good buy,"The last pages are a waste (glossary, about 100 pages), but the rest of it is in a question answer format that at times seem to contradict themselves. I think he should stick with nutrition he seems to know that, and leave the bodybuilding questions to people who know what they are talking about. Also just one side note I thought that he was disrespectful to Mike Mentzer calling him ""ignorant"". I am not a huge fan of Mike Mentzer, but I think that he forgot more about bodybuilding than Chris will ever know. I usually like Chris Aceto's books, this one however is not typical of his work."
1,A complete waste of time,"This ""book"" is a series of bland questions compled with hyperbolic answers. The author is incapable of suing the english language, and appears incapable of undertakking research. Far from being scientific in approach, often there will either be a bald contention (I do this so it must be right) or simply wrong statements (eg the claim that there are no studies on the preferable number of sets). The book is barely readable, coming in the form of stream of consciousness q and a's, dogmatically presented with no real analysis, depth or insight. The layout is decidly unimaginative, sparse text interspersed with (wholly unrelated) pictures of body builders. There are no explanatory graphics or charts. I feel decidedly cheated in purchasing this book. And SURELY publishers should be able to correct a guy who doesn't know the distinction between your and you're. Buy a men's health instead."
4,One of the Greats of Afro-Peruvian Music,"The first album to get if you're interested in this wonderful music is ""Afro-Peruvian Classics: The Soul of Black Peru"". If you enjoy Lucila Campos' two cuts and want to hear more, this a an excellent choice."
1,Not Good for the Price,"I spent nearly $400 for this translator, thinking that the premium price would maybe yield a premium product. I was highly disappointed. The unit is so thick and long that someone not-so-wittily joked, ""The 1980's called and they want their PDA back."" The problem was that I completely understood his point.The controls are not intuitive, the screen is difficult to read, the software seems antiquated, and the dictionary's speech function isn't helpful at all because the computer voice is not close enough to natural speech so that one can emulate it and still be understood by native speakers.Over 6 months of living in Latin America, I found myself using my paper dictionary exclusively, while this 'brick' collected dust on a shelf."
4,"Okay, I Guess.","It's holding four bikes right now. Which is nice. In this era of crap and junk, at least this thing does what it says it'll do. Unfortunately, I suppose that rates four stars. Mediocrity is the new excellence."
4,Excellent book...binding ridiculous,"This book has a tremendous amount of information. It has enhanced my life and has tons of resources in the back. Like others' stated previously, the book fell apart at the first opening of it."
3,"Good, but maybe hard to implement...","I thought the book was very interesting and thought provoking; however, I don't think it would be realistic for me as a mother of two young children to implement all of the lifestyle changes recommended at this time. I am hoping to start the process of ""shedding,"" as the author refers to it, but I'm thinking it will be a long process (several years). Also, there is a lot of cost in changing all of your cosmetics, etc. And, I tried the organic deodorant (without aluminum) and I stunk too bad to keep using it--I went back to my old stand by. This is a good book to buy, though. It is well written and contains lots of good info and websites to go to for additional info. Hope this helped."
4,Nutrition and Beauty,This book explains how the foods you eat can control your health and beauty. She explains how to manipulate your system and well-being with nutrition. Powerful information.
4,The Truth About Beauty,"Oh, boy! I purchased this book after watching her interview on PBS. I already practice a lot of what Kat preaches. This book reinforces it.I found a lot more useful information in the appendices and resources. Add this book to your library!"
5,An amazing book!,"This is the best book I've ever read on health and beauty. It is truly life transforming. Who knew we were literally showering ourselves with toxins at every turn? I have suffered from a wide variety of horrible skin problems including cystic acne, rosacea, and many different kinds of rashes. My skin is getting a little better every day that I implement this program and an added bonus is that I've lost several very stubborn post pregnancy pounds as a result of working to eliminate white sugar and flour. I am so grateful for Kat James's amazing work."
5,Life Transforming,"This book is so full of information that is backed by scientific evidence. James lists all of her sources. This is not a book about some one's opinion, it's a textbook for those that want to change their body and their life from the inside out. The way we should live. Cures for everything and practical information. This book has benefited my 3 children, my husband, every one that I come in contact with and my life as well. I feel better than I have felt in 10 years or more. I have kicked so many bad habits and without sacrifice. I eat more now than I have ever eaten. I gained a few pounds at the beginning, but am steadily losing weight. My skin is glowing, my hair is silky, my thyroid is correct, I have no migraine headaches, I have no cracked heels, I have not been sick since I began this process and I look years younger. It's amazing and correct and tried and true. If you choose, a total transformation awaits. :)"
5,I love Mary Beth!,"You'll find yourself singing these songs in the car, in the shower, on the street -- this is a truly talented artist whose creative, evocative songwriting and clear voice will definitely take her places. If you like folk or country women singers, or just appreciate beautiful melodies combined with good, solid writing, you should buy this disc."
2,Mehndi Henna Kit Missing Essentials,"We bought the Mehndi Henna Kit for our 13-year-old daughter for Christmas and are very disappointed in the product. Years ago, I had my hands hennaed with traditional designs while traveling in India, and we expected the kit to include stencils, examples, and instructions for those kinds of traditional designs--as is implied by the illustrations on the box itself. We also expected that the kit would contain some information about the culture and history of decorating the hands with henna. No such thing. The kit includes the raw materials and equipment for creating the designs. It does not include examples and instruction for creating traditional designs. Very disappointing!"
5,Wonderful,Noa has a beautiful and sweet voice. The songs are very good. I'm very happy for buying this cd.
5,burn your record collection,"set them afire. no, actually keep 'em as reminders of what OTHER music sounds like because VCR sounds nothing like anything you have in your collection. no, not even you electroclash dude with the fauxhawk. no, not you, dirty record shop obscure dude with the dirty white t-shirt and rivers cuomo glasses.no, they DON'T sound like the faint. they sound like a garbage truck running over keyboards crashing into plugged-in hairdryers being dropped into bathtubs filled with acid parading down bourbon street, minus the jazz and old ladies flashing their baggy t*tties. with punk vocals. but not the annoying 1-2-3 type of vocals.the album will blow your mind and your speakers. but see them live for the real deal."
2,"Bad singing, bad songs, bad everything.","I picked up this CD for $1.95, when i was hunting for random dance music for my collection. let me tell you: it wasn't worth it. this band is an assault on my ears. i'm not someone who is obessessed with interesting or even good music. but this is really the pits. in all likelihood, if you don't know them personally, are sane, and are over 12, you will probably hate VCR with a passion. I can really not see dancing to any of this. the lyrics are absolutely terrible. the synth sounds are cheesy and have badly written parts. the singing isn't even singing, it's just yelling semi-rythmically. and i'm a fan of hip-hop. but this is just bad. i urge you to not buy this CD. just look at the fact that as of now, some people are trying to sell it for a quarter here on amazon."
2,not effective,"This product did not work well for me. I did, however, notice that although my nails did not grow longer, they did not chip and split as much. I would have given this product at least 3 starts for that fact, except that the bottle was half empty when I received it. I did not get the promised .45 oz."
2,Did not work,Based on the reviews I decided to try this product I have been a nail biter for several years and recently stopped so I bought this product its 7 dys nw and no result the Miracle growth in the gold bottle worked better in 5dys my nails were longer with that product I guess everyone is different.
3,lazer guide,I used the lazer guide on a small floor saw application and found that it did work well unless you are operating in full sunlight. The sun seemed to erase the line I needed. However inside of a room without the sun the line projected about 6 feet in front of the saw. I continue to use this product inside with great results.
1,Eats batteries,"OK, it eats batteries because my workers forget to turn it off. But a set of the batteries is nearly $6. Stopped using it."
3,works but flimsy,The laser works fine but the mounting system is flimsy and unstable. Plan on making your own support bracket if you want this to be accurate and useful.
5,Great Chakra Healing Tutorial,I have other DVDs and Books by Steve Murray and I am always happy with his programs. I bought both of his new DVDs Chakra Healing Step by Step and Aura Healing Step by Step off his web site and both are great tutorials for Healing the Chakras and Aura. I highly recommend both if you are interested in learning how to heal the Chakras and Aura.
3,The Greatest Terrible Book Ever!,"This classic weight loss/medical book is one of the funniest pieces of literature I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The author is convinced that chewing one's food to a paste will cure most diseases and cause you to lose weight. This alone isn't the most humorous aspect of this book. The most amazing part is that the author believes this discovery ranks him with the likes of Columbus and Alexander The Great. If you can ever get ahold of this book, you must read it!"
3,4 oz. Stainless Steel Ice Scoop,"Not what I expected. Larger in size than I need and quality was not what I hoped for; I cannot use it for guests. The picture makes it look more solid than it is. But for the price, it is not worth returning."
1,Stainless steel scoop,Price point was low but recommended with the portable ice machine that we bought. Quality was also low. Not very durable.
2,Sent Back!,"This scoop is more commercial standard that general consumer. Like stated before, its made out of two pieces of stamped sheet metal and not very ergonomic on your hands. It's too shallow of a scoop to be used in a normal sized ice bucket, however it might be better off used in a cooler for parties or scooping out small amounts of dog food."
1,Don't waste you efforts,This scoop is nothing but a piece of junk! Do not waste you time and efforts much less your money to order this inferior scoop!
2,Bad Handle,"The handle is very odd shaped. It's rough on the edges and I can see where it would be painful if used for an extended period. Honestly, I'm not sure I'll ever use it but it was too cheap to bother returning."
3,Shipped wrong size,I order a lot from Amazon and have never had a problem before.I ordered 2 of the 4 oz scoops and 2 of the 6 oz scoops.Unfortunately on this order I received 4 of the 6 oz scoops - ie wrong size on the 4 oz scoops.
2,Sheet steel,"Although thee scoop is made from stainless steel, it wasn't clear from the photo that it's actually made from two pieces of sheet steel: the handle is one sheet, ""cupped"" to form the handle, and the bowl is another sheet. The two pieces are then tacked together at the handle joint. Although it's reasonably strong, and doesn't seem to flex, I'm looking for something a bit more substantial and presentable, with a solid handle cross-section, for use on my bar. I like the look of steel, to match my ice bucket, but it looks like I'll be moving to a solid cast aluminum scoop instead."
2,"Handle isn't solid, doesn't look good upside down, cafeteria-esque","I was a little disappointed with this scoop. It looks like something from a lunch room instead of something presentable enough for home entertaining. The handle is just a piece of curved metal (like a half moon); it doesn't have a complete cylindrical look as expected. I've used it for scooping birdseed and it works great, but I think I overpaid for something that will just end up in my garage."
2,Not a keeper,"I wasn't too enthused with the light gauge of this metal and sent my order back when I received it. For an ice scoop, I think the manufacturer could have used something a bit heavier gauge than this because I can imagine scooping chunks of ice with this would bend it in short order. I purchased ice scoops from a local housewares store and they were 3 for the price I paid for this and were a heavier gauge of aluminum, which fit both in my ice bucket and I keep one directly in the ice bin in the freezer. Shop around unless you have no other options."
1,Wish I had read the reviews,"I don't know how I missed reading the reviews on this. It is cheap, and I will probably pay more to return it than it cost."
1,"Dull, Duller and Dullest",This book is not very enlightening. Most of it is filled with familar lyrics. I thought it was going to be a Broadway Producer's Journey. No such luck. It is filled with traditional Broadway folklore. This book is filled with stories everyone has heard many times over. A major disappointment.
2,A poor publication of a brilliant work,"As an owner of this book and an actual student of Ostrow at the University of Houston, I have a particular insite to this piece. We covered the material in class and somehow the energy, excitement, and passion we got as students is missing in the printing. Ostrow is one of the great ""thinkers and doers"" of the theatrical world. Unfortunately, the book doesn't do justice to the passion Ostrow has for the art form. What this should have been was two books--a formal critical analysis of the genre and its history with a separate biography of his involvement and life story. Those are two books I would buy, read, re-read, and cherish. Is this one worthwhile? Yes. Better yet--beg, borrow, or steal to get to Houston to take his classes. Anyone serious about the future of theatre should be begging to be here.One of the lucky ones."
3,"Poor splice connectors, you may need to shorten cable too","The wiring kit comes long and unless you want to have a coil of wire before it is attached to the contactor, then you will need to shorten it. The kit does not include additional 6 gauge connectors. I bought the connectors locally and then needed to crimp them on. I ended up using a small diameter punch to cinch/crimp them on.A second problem is that for the multi-mount you need bigger connector boot covers that Warn supplies due to the fact that you will have doubled up 6 gauge wire attached to the contactor and the single wire boots won't work.I ended up using a quality silicone to water proof the wire leads at the contactor."
5,Great Transaction,"This was a great transaction. I have ordered several products from Dr. Christopher's, the Kidney Formula being one of the more recent ones. I received it here in Iraq in a very reasonable amount of time and it was in perfect condition. I would have no problem ordering from Dr. Christopher's again and most likely I will soon. Good products, reasonable price. Reviewed by Mark Grant, author of Blood of Scotland, available at Amazon.com"
1,"""calligraphy""","This is one of the books that display examples of ""pseudo-calligraphy."" The author's other professions or backgrounds in visual arts do not necessarily guarantee a sound knowledge of writing. I'm sorry to say that it tends to a book of bad influence. The book (almost a pamphlet in terms of depth) does not deal with the roman and Foundational hands so essential to a decent knowledge of lettering. I would recommend a more prestigious or trusted publication (with English scribes, for example)."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Two fleets of ships war through time. The Captain of one vessel falls prey to one of his staff, a member of a secret cult. They both survive, and the Captain, exposed to the timestream and amnesiac is convicted when court-martialled. A capital crime, he will be used as a time courier.Exposure to the 'strat' twice affects him differently, and he discovers that the conflict is definitely not as it seems, and there is a much greater battle raging."
3,"Better than nothing, but not by much","First, the good: the flashlight works as advertised. Shake it and light comes out one end.Second, the bad: the flashlight's design is screwy. Instead of placing the LED bulb inside some sort of reflector setup, as in every other flashlight you've probably ever used, the LED is mounted on a tiny circuit board suspended in body. This means that much of the light leaks through the side of the body instead of being directed out the front. Also, the normal protective lens from a normal flashlight was replaced by a magnifying glass - to serve in place of the ""missing"" silvery reflector, I suppose. The result is a beam that's neither well-focused nor evenly diffused.Still, it really does work. Although I wouldn't use one to replace a normal flashlight, it makes an OK emergency backup."
1,EVERLIFE IS LITTLELITE,"EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005Reviewer: AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviewsLIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT."
5,Noticeable difference,"In the process of doing my 60K service on a 2004 Mazda MPV, I decided to switch to synthetic. Hands down Royal Purple gets the best praise and reviews so thought I'd give it a try.I was amazed that I actually noticed a difference after changing the oil and replacing with synthetic in terms of fuel economy (about ~2mpg improvement). Performance is slightly noticeably better but I also replaced the air filter, spark plugs and tranny fluid at the same time so not sure I can say the oil alone helped there.My only complaint is that I failed to realize what a great cost Amazon has for this item. I ended up paying $8.99/qt at the local Schucks and won't make that mistake next time!"
2,Royal Purple 15W40,"I have been using 15W40 R/P oil for about 4-years in my 2001 Ford 4X4 Diesel Excursion. I also run a High End Bypass Filtration Solutions Soot Oil Filter. The oil stays clean almost like new for a good 10,000 miles and oil samples are like new due to the soot oil filter doing its job. That's good, but mileage improvement verses Rotella regular oil is no different whatsoever. Nothing! So while it may be a good extended use oil, its not anywhere what they claim it to be. At least not in Diesel Engines. So for the cost of what you get it is really a big-looser. This is the last time I'll likley run it in my Excursion, I am going back to Rotella and save a good deal of money per oil change. I give it 2 stars"
5,Mr Toyman,I am always looking for a better price and Amazon is where I found it. Have been using Royal Purple oil for sometime and find it to be an excellent product
5,"More power, cooler engine",Just switched to Royal Purple today in my 2008 Chrysler Sebring convertible with the 2.7 V6. Noticeably more power and the temp gauge is lower by a hash mark (not sure of the actual temperature) and I'm happy.
2,item recieved is not the one in the picture,"This is not a review of the product.This is a review of the actual packaging.This item was received in a 5 gallon pail with out a dispenser spout. The item pictured is not a bucket.Surprise is usually not a good thing.I also am not fond of the idea of having an open 5 gallon bucket that I have to dispense a product from without contamination of either the product in the bucket or the dispensed product.A 5 gallon pail without a dispenser spout is tough to work with. The price and product is great, just bummed I didn't receive what was pictured."
5,Excellent Motor Oil,"Royal Purple is always considered as one of the top synthetic oils available, and this specific oil is definitely one of the best."
5,Made a difference right away,"This is my first time running synthetic oil....I researched brands, specs, product loyalty, and customer service reviews, etc...Royal Purple got my vote, so I got some and had it put in two days ago. I immediately noticed smoother idle, better response, quieter engine and a slight increase in gas mileage. It seems to go down the highway easier, so I'm not surprised that I'm getting closer to 31mpg now.The car is a 2005 scion xb (automatic trans) with 81,000 original miles.I'm sold on royal purple....having never used another brand, I couldn't tell you if my car would have had the same difference in performance/mileage/etc. as the royal purple made...all I can say is I noticed a difference, and that makes me a happy camper...."
1,Just another synthetic,"I have previously been using Mobil 1 in all of my vehicles and boats. Royal Purple claims of ""feel the performance"" as well as improved mileage and more horse power. I didn't receive any of that! I'm a certified GM technician and this is good oil however it is ""just another synthetic"". It's not the ""magical mystery oil"" Royal Purple claims.Not worth the additional cost in my opinion. Jr"
1,"Dont waste your money, Totaly useless!!","It is true RP is all hype , changed my oil in my jaguar x-type , from Castrol edge 5w30 with KN oil filter to RP 5w30 with RP oil filter.Which from RP Ads and promo vids thought will be an upgrade.Well I was so wrong!!! MPG dropped from 29 to 24 HWY ,even worse my car has acting up in rough idle and knocks. It might be that for Ford engines it is just not the right oil ,I will be switching back to Castrol edge or Mobil 1 0w30 as they always delivered in performance and fuel economy.In short Do not buy Royal purple!! for me it was a total downgrade and waste of money."
4,Good digital frame for the money.,"I bought the frame as a gift for my mother in-law. We played with all the features and found it easy to use. She has used it every day since Christmas (over a month) and has had no problems. The picture is not really ""spectacular"", but what do you expect from such a small screen. In all, we are very happy with it."
5,great gift,This was really a great gift to give. My wife a devout photo nut has really enjoyed it. I found the quality of the replay to be great and very easy to use. they were on special in the treasure chest when I bought it. I wish I would have bought 4 or 5!
2,Great Info - Poor Kindle Edition,"The information in the book is great. I am using it for graduate school. However, if you need page number / indexing for citations or working in a mixed paper environment then choose the paper edition. I did notice that it is scanned work as well, some of the letters don't display properly (reading on the new iPad). I just ordered a paper copy."
1,Great Book. Lousy format for Kindle,"Our team utilizes this book as part of out training. We all have paper copies and I wanted an electronic version on my Ipad. I paid for another copy of this book for Kindle. What a joke! It is photcopied! You charged me $40.00 for a photocopied book. No wonder piracy is so rampant. I want my money back, or at least discounted."
5,Actually recommendable/Muy recomendable,"Clear, observative and Easy-going on the subject. It reflects the key guidelines of Team Management. Do not hesitate. Claro, observador y ameno en la temática. Retrata los puntos clave de la Gestión de Equipos. No lo dudes."
4,"Cal Poly student review, Brian Leininger",This book was well written and easy to understand. It gave a lot of information that would be useful for anyone attempting to use teams for projects.
1,I got no book,I need and want my book that I have not yet received. Please Please Please Please send it. You have already taken my MONEY
5,A Direct Answer From God,"This Trials to Ministry Cd ministered to me in a way that I never had experienced before. It was the direct answer to questions that I had asked God. I wondered why I was going through so much in life. ""TRIALS TO MINISTRY"" started out telling me about me: crying all night long, wondering where I went wrong, fustrated and disappointed, yes I too was ready to give up, thinking that I couldn't make it. Just hearing this song I knew that I wasn't along and that someone else been there and it really felt like they knew what I was going through. It was a blessing and confirmation letting me know what was really going on and that there was hope. I thank God that I know that ""IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON"". I had to ""GET PASS MY PASS"" so that God could lead me forward. Yes, I am still crying but Thanks be to God, they are now tears of joy.."
4,Great Alternative Country/Rock/Pop/Bluegrass,"Track 5 is my favorite. Tracks 1, 4, 8, 9, and 10 are great, but so different that the album's genre is hard to classify. Overall, the CD fell just shy of getting five stars from me, and that's only because three of the songs were just not quite at the same level as the others. I'd recommend this CD to a friend as a good value - this is a top notch group that'll have your friends asking how you discovered them."
3,Did not live up to my expectations,"Reading this book was a bit like riding a gentle roller coster. At times I kind of liked it, at times I kind of didn't. At the end of the ride, I was down at the bottom, not very enthusiastic. An Abbott enthusiast (who had just about quit looking for a new book by author), I found that the book did not deliver. The plot is very convoluted and the ending is rushed. The main characters are likable--creating characters might be Abbott's strength--and the dialogue is fairly strong, but overall I felt that the writing was choppy and the quality of the book very uneven. I will try Abbott again, because of the strength of his other books, but I have a hard time giving a strong recommendation to this one."
4,Great twisting plot!,Abbott keeps you guessing throughout the book. It's a great light read. One critique I will make is that the stoyline contains a few too many twists that add no value to the story.
2,Quite different from the previous series,"I am thrilled to see that Mr. Abbott has picked up the pen again after so many years. I purchased his first book on impulse at a grocery store in Austin, TX. Since then, he has been one of my favorite authors. Over the past several years I kept checking to see if he has written a new book.A Kiss Gone Bad was nothing like I expected. Language, Serial Killers, gore, etc. kept me from finishing the book. He took the path of Patterson, Sandford, and King. I'm sure that there is a large audience for A Kiss Gone Bad, and I hope that he finds it. Call me sentimental and bring back Jordan Poteet."
4,Good...but Jordan Poteet is better!,"Nothing Jeff Abbott writes is poor reading, and this is an excellent book. But his Mirabeau, Texas-centered books with Jordan Poteet are much more enjoyable reading...you actually grow to care about the characters. Wish he'd bring 'em back!"
2,"As for me and my house, we will brood","When nurse Larcy Ryan takes a job as caregiver to cancer and heart patient David Magnam, she has no idea what web of secrets and lies she's inserting herself into. Everything is oh so mysterious, and there's even talk of.... murder (I swear, the author actually writes ""....murder"" and she isn't even being funny).As time passes, Larcy learns more and more things that leave her fearful and suspicious. That brooding house, it broods, broodily. Larcy lives in a state of panic and trepidation, which worsens with every new incident that occurs. The puzzle pieces begin to form a picture, a climax is reached (and I'm not talking sex-- by the way, there's no sex in this book, if that makes any difference to you), everyone takes their bows, The End.We're all familiar with these types of storylines, I'm sure, and you'll find nothing revelatory or unique here. It's an okay way to pass a few hours, but that's about all it is."
2,Uneven Lewis Comedy Gets Widescreen Treatment,"Finally available on DVD, the erratic ""Which Way to the Front?"" (1970) has a few classic sequences featuring Jerry Lewis in top form. After a slow start, the World War II farce improves when Jerry impersonates a Nazi officer - highlighted by his brilliant Chaplinesque ballet with Adolf Hitler. Though a major hit in Europe, this Lewis effort was barely shown in America. Opening credits begin near the 20-minute mark - a rarity in cinema history. The Warner Archive release has an excellent widescreen transfer, but no extras.OVERALL RATING: **"
2,Which Way to the Trash?,"Bought this to try unusual movies. And to see Dack Rambo in something other than Murder She Wrote or Guns of Will Sonnet. However, this had no plot. Was choppy & lacked any humor. And the actor who is the voice of Classic Tigger as a Nazi is most unsettling!"
1,broke in 15 months of normal wear,"I placed this in a newly renovated home with new front door. There were three room mates - nothing crazy. We entered and left like sane, normal people. Fast forward 15 months and the handle breaks off the door. I come home to check it, and the metal housing on the INSIDE of the handle case had snapped - and from normal wear. No one attempted to break in or anything. The damage had nothing to do with the deadbolt or receiver area - the break occurred inside the handle screw housing. I'm contacting Kwikset for advice on replacement now. Will update once I hear back from them.Update: Kwikset was able to send a replacement, but since this was discontinued, they sent me a different handset BUT NOT the lockset. So I have a sliver handle and a bronze lockset. Great. Thanks for that, Kwikset."
1,It's not silver!!!,"We were very upset when we received our doorknob and saw that it was gold. (Not at all what it looked like on Amazon.)We, my husband and I, both thought it looked silver and there was no reference to it's color in the description except that it was steel. A color description would have saved us alot of trouble. Not only do we need to send it back now, but there was no phone # or address for customer service. When I contacted the distributor(Ace) directly ,they told me they would call me back, and never did! I am still sitting with an unwanted doorknob, out the money, and hesitant to order from Amazon again."
3,A little smaller than expected,"I really like this tea set but was a little disappointed in its size. It does make two nice cups of tea but even with preparing the cast iron before brewing tea by placing hot water in it, I found my tea got colder than expected after a while. But I bought a tea kettle warmer and it works great. I love the tea strainer for bulk tea as well. Still a much better bargain than the tea pots I've seen in the pricier stores like Teavana - a good bargain"
4,As much as I like this set...,"I am left wondering why the box it came in also lists the trivet that is not included. I bought 4 sets total, 3 as gifts, from 2 different suppliers. None came with the trivet, only 3 were shipped in the original boxes (same dealer). I really love the set, it is beautiful and quite functional. I just feel a bit duped. I guess parting out a set is just one more way to make money."
4,Detail Sander,"We build custom furniture and needed something to get into tight spots. This sander works for us, little heavy but great price."
1,I miss the cool mouse features,"I also compared this to my Black & Decker Mouse, and I'm disenchanted. I miss all the neat attachments that come with the mouse for detail fininshing. I have a higher powered 1/4 sheet sander for my more agressive work and reserve my Mouse for all the fine details. the GMC just doesn't get in all those tight places. If you're using this sander as your primary sanding tool, you'll be there a long time. Try stepping up to a 1/4 sheet or a Ros (with a little more muscle) and buy a new mouse to get into those impossible spots."
3,OK for the price paid,"I bought this on sale. For the price, it is an OK mouse sander. Be aware that the dust port, doesn't not function as describe. I would give the dust port 1 star. It works well enough. Also, it should bring a small bag or some to place over the dust port, that is NOT included."
2,Disappointing,"I was rather disappointed with this book. Many of the recipies are overly simple and uncreative. The majority of the recipies call for canned items. The worst offender is this salsa ""recipe"": one can tomato sauce, once can chopped tomatoes, one can diced green chiles, 1/2 cup diced red onion, salt & pepper. Too bad they don't can diced red onions or I'm sure they would have been in this recipe as well...."
2,Left Out,"This is a beautifully written Biblically based story - BUT we have a multi-racial family. The book has the recurring phrase ""And God made me a beautiful brown!"" Some of my children are brown and some aren't - in fact we are all shades. I felt like this book didn't acknowledge the beauty of ALL skin colors God created."
5,Great dialogue starter,"My family is blended, my husband and I are white. We have 2 biological kids and two adopted African-American kids. We need bridges between two different looks, this book helped. Also, great for families who are African-American and families who are white or Asian or whatever. Starts discussion with kids about skin color and what it does or doesn't mean. Does it in a spiritual, not religious way."
1,LOUSY PRODUCT,Ive used mood lipstick for years...I finally ran out and ordered a multi pack from Amazon...each one theoretically should produce a slight shade variation...but this is not so with this product...all of the mood lipsticks in the multipack all produce the same exact shade.
5,hard to find lipstick,"Order was a week late being delivered. Product arrived in good shape and was exacly as ordered. this was a gift for my mom, and we can not find it anywhere around were we live. This is the only lipstick that she likes so i was very glad to find it. I will be ordering on a regular basis."
2,Behh,I bought these at my local beauty supply but they are the same brand. On my lips they all apply the same color; hot pink or fuschia. They is no other shade. Plus side is the formula is moisturizing and staining
3,"Not bad quality, not the best either","I'd been looking for the ""mood"" lipsticks--no other kind has their staying power. These are not bad, but they don't work as well as other brands I've used. They are colorful and fun, but the tubes are very loose so applying the lipstick requires more-than-normal holding. It is fun to have so many colors."
4,Mood Lipstick,"I wish that they would offer only the colors that I needed, instead of ordering all the colors I don't like or need"
2,Literal Heir,"Hartin selects a proper title for the book and then resorts to Catholic apologism for why Jesus and James weren't really even related at all, when James is in control of the movement after Jesus, the reason is best found in the title for this book! The genalogies in Matthew and Luke that show Jesus as legitimate King of Israel, must be carried to the next step. After Jesus dies with no offspring, and Jesus next brother, James, is given honor by all Jews who hoped for a Messiah, (including Pharisees), sense is made of James being in charge, and how the thought of being observed by envoys from James cause even Peter to end behavior that may not be found lawful, (as in Galatians)."
2,"adequate, but nothing special","Each page has an image of one animal, such as a tortoise, pig, fish, or frog. the animal word is at the top of the page, and in slightly smaller text, there are animal ""part"" words placed near the appropriate areas lower down on the page. For example, the frog drawing has eye, mouth, toe, and leg labelled.The drawings are very simple and colorful. Children should be able to relate to the drawings just fine. My toddler son has no problem identifying the animals, and even the parts (he doesn't understand ""gill"" just yet), but he's not at all excited about the book.I guess the book is pretty boring. Other similar books are exciting for him. If you want a book that shows animals and animal parts to young children, you should shop around. You'll be able to find better books than these.ken32"
4,Myself Belts,"This was the second ""Myself Belt"" I purchased; my son outgrew his first after much use. Now 4, my son is able to quickly and easily unfasten the belt to use the bathroom, then refasten it without assistance. We really enjoy the independence it's given him, and appreciate the many colors and styles. The one drawback is the limited ability to tighten the belt - so you can't go a little larger and allow for growth. Other than that, we have only good things to say about it."
5,Great for Horselovers,"I love horses so when I saw this game I wanted it instantly! It was easy and challengeing depending on the race. There are lots of pretty horses to chose from, besides the different tracks and it's condition. It also helps you learn about different racing terms and picking the best odds."
4,Great horselover game!,"This game is great!I bought this game because I love horses and I love to ride them! The graphics are great and the practice mode you can have ANY horse you want! I must say though, the season mode is very hard to keep up with since you can't afford a top winning horse right away- and you might loose alot of races and lose even more money. Otherwise its great and if you don't want what I just said to happen, practice mode is where you want to be! I highly recommend this to horse lovers everywhere!"
4,"Pretty fun, tons of horses and races to choose from","I really love horse racing, so I found this game to be pretty fun. There are an enormous amount of horses to choose from to race with lots of statistics about each one. The game itself is a little bit tricky to figure out how to work, but only for a couple of races. I have found it to be a challenge though - not too easy!"
3,HARD!,This game is fun but REALLY hard to win i only won one race and I've been playing for over a month. You should rent it first so you can see if you like it. Other than that the game is pretty fun and easy to work.
2,Mikasa futsal ball didn't hold up,"I really liked this ball when I first got it - weight, touch, everything was good, but it doesn't hold up well. After only a couple games I could see the stitches being stressed and the ball had deformed into a slight egg shape. Bummer."
1,"Defective product, do not buy!","This ball came with a defective valve and it does not satisfy the ""Futsal"" standard. Mikasa has a great name with volleyballs so I suspect the seller (Amazon) sold me the rejects of the warehouse. Very unhappy with this purchase, even further that the seller is Amazon."
1,Mikasa ball does not last,The covering tore up in one session. It did hold air for 5-6 games. I am still searching for a good indoor ball.
1,Not worth it. It won't last.,"Bought this ball 3 months ago and it started to deteriorate after the 1st week. Finally, last night the stitching became undone. I was only using it once a week on a hardwood basketball court. Amazon will not take it back, lets see if Mikasa USA will."
1,Mikasa doesn't last,"Bought 3 of these for a weekly futsal game, and all 3 had the panels begin to peel off after a dozen sessions or so. Now trying the Baden, hoping it's a little tougher, but only have 6-7 weeks on it so far."
3,One ball won't hold air,"I purchased 2 balls. At first I was very happy as the balls appeared to be of good quality and have a good feel to them. However, one of the balls won't hold air over time. I have to fill it up before every practice. More annoying than anything."
2,Falling apart after 2 months,Title says it all really.We use it once a week for one hour. Maybe twice every month. Already starting to see cover or outside material fall off.
2,Did not survive contact,A seam in the stitching broke during the first training session with the ball. Never had that happen before with any other futsal ball.
1,Not a proper futsal ball,"I own three other futsal balls (Baden game ball, Vizari 600, and Uhlsport Medusa). This ball bounces far too much (about twice as high when dropped from 3 meters). The surface also feels sponge-like and is not solid enough. I wish I could return it, but we have already used it."
5,No matter what.....this is a classic movie!!!,"I am not one for image quality (even though to my unrefined eye...it was good), or this digital whatchmacallit or doodad. I am one who grew up in the 70s/80s, and remember watching THE LAST REMAKE OF BEAU GESTE with my buddies on HBO (remember the old HBO???).This movie is a classic comedy that was beautifully crafted by the mind, body, and ""eye"" of a British comedic genius known as Marty Feldman, may he rest in peace. It is a classic melding of British comedy with American flair, and a huge helping of Mel Brooks flavor to boot. The humor is not for everyone, and that is ok. Thank God we're not all the same, and have different tastes in comedy and what we find funny. And, Thank God....I find this funny.This DVD is on my ""must-have"" list of movies, and now I am damn grateful that I could find it through Amazon.com.Thank you Amazon for making this available to all of us."
3,Last Remake of Beau Geste,Great movie. I was disappointed that I could not get the closed captions on this movie.
2,"The movie would be great, if the disc played...","But it doesn't. To describe the problem in full, during the first ten minutes the disc keeps skipping ahead a half second at a time, then about at the scene when he is first adopting Beau and his twin, the player could no longer read the disc. Now I am attempting to play the movie in the U.S. on a Playstation two, and the back of the disc has a deep, bluish green reflection, but I do not detect any scratches. It may just be the Playstation itself, but it played a new copy of Inception perfectly well, and it has a problem here. Perhaps someone could make suggestions."
3,memory lies,"been waiting years for this film to be released on dvd. sigh ... wasn't worth it. although there are parts that are as funny as remembered, overall it's a lame effort only a little less cringe-inducing than ""yellowbeard"" (which also wasted mr feldman's talents). the lack of extras & the excessive price make it even more disappointing. you can watch this film on hulu interrupted with the occasional irritating advert. probably a more suitable waste of time than dropping your hard-earned dosh on this package."
3,a Marty Feldman movie with Ann-Margret,"i love Ann-Margret and this is a 70s hoot. a strange comedy of Beau Geste with Michael York as the blonde hero. Marty as the director and comic of this movie. and Ann-Margret is the vixen cheating wife mother...what else is there to want in this film. it is a bit confusing plot wise, it is a comedy adventure film. still a 1970s movie, not a M-G-M movie of the old days, or a straight remake of a Gary Cooper film of the past. but you've got to admit AM is worth looking at, through out the film."
4,Marty Feldman at his best,"After 30 years of not being able to view this film, it was a great find. I laughed just as hard as I did when I saw it at the movies when it first opened. This movie is loaded with some of the great comic genius' of our time. Marty Feldman was at the height of his career and stars as Beau Gest's(Michael York) twin brother. Peter Ustinov is brilliant as the French foreign legion Sargent. If you love classic comedies you'll love this film. Stars include Michael York, James Earl Jones, Ann Margret, and the list goes on."
4,A british Mel Brooks film,"Marty Feldman proves that he learned well from the master parodist Mel Brooks with this humorous spoof of BEAU GESTE. Recommended primarily for fans of raunchy humor, and fans of British comedy. This film has several hilarious bits: the used camel salesman, clips from the old BEAU GESTE films, and Jack the Ripper (""We ask no questions here.""), and Feldman's tribute to silent comedy."
4,"A bizarre comedy, good sight gags & every British comedien!","I like it! From the opening gimmic of the 'finger in the sky', which we've all dreamed of, to the 'Damn this thirst' ending it's a feast of the odd-ball. Mr Malten is right, Spike Milligan is superb as the butler but I think the scene stealer is Peter Ustiniov's horse! If you have an interest in British comic talent (yes there is some) then just about all British comedians do a cameo here. The original movie cops a hit as well and why not? This movie is best viewed with normality suspended and the ability to laugh at the absurd jammed on full."
5,Brilliant Comedy by Underappreciated Genius,"I hadn't seen this since it was released in the theaters in 1977 and not only does it hold up, it's funnier than I remembered it being. The story of twin brothers - Marty Feldman and Michael York - who end up in the French Foreign Legion, it's hysterical. Feldman is incredible with his comedic delivery, physical comedy, and directing. ""The Escape"" scene is five minutes long and funnier than most entire movies. Immediately after watching this I looked up some of Feldman's British shows and they're just as funny. This movie has it all - brilliant wordplay, intelligent parody, and some outstanding slapstick. If you're a fan of Monty Python or Mel Brooks you will love this movie. It's easy to see where the Pythons got their training after watching Feldman at work. Most people know Marty Feldman from his work in Mel Brooks' movies but I'm hoping that this movie will be successful on Amazon and encourage the release of his British shows as well."
2,Backup Exec will empty your wallet,"I am not and never will be a fan of software that is sold to a consummer as ""al-a-carte"". Once you purchase the basic version of the Backup Exec software, you will be required to pay handsomely for remote agents, server agents, SQL and other types of agents to make the thing work. Don't get me wrong, if all you're having to worry about is your own personal machine, then this might be a good application. But in the event you want to backup across a network, be prepared to dip heavily into your budget to accomplish this task. Do not rely on the people who work for Veritas. They tell you anything you want to hear, then ask you to pay handsomely to make it work correctly."
4,Progressive R&B Music,"This is mostly club-style late 80's early 90's dance music with some uptempo R&B music. I found about half of the songs to be worth listening to, which is better than average. The album is fairly sexually charged. The tracks Show and Tell, Come and Get It, and Satisfied are exactly what their titles suggest. Holiday is a good slow song. Lifetime Groove is one of my favorites, and late 80's R&B at its best. For the rest of the album, you have to like 80's dance music to like this album. It's really good for that. Definitely don't buy this album for the cover art because the front cover is all you get. But the music is good."
5,This is a must read!,"Traveling the Purposeful Path is a life changing experience. It is simple and powerful. I have read so many books on how to find passion and fulfillment that my book shelves are full. Yet, my life didn't really change that much and I never really found the peace and fulfillment that I was looking for. Traveling the Purposeful Path helps you realize the gap of where you are starting from and where you want to be. You identify the self limiting beliefs that are ingrained in your being and learn to shift to a more purposeful place. A place where you show up every day as you truly are meant to be. This isn't a book to me....it is now a way I live my life. I am crystal clear on my life purpose and I spend everyday that I am given truly being and doing what God has planned for me."
5,Practical guide to purposeful living,"I have experienced the Purpose Process in person with Brad Swift and through his website. This book is another opportunity to meet this heart-centered teacher and to learn a practical way to uncover your life purpose. Although it is filled with gems, it is worth reading just to become acquainted with what Swift calls your ""inherited purpose."" With this one new perspective you will begin to understand how old messages and beliefs sabotage your attempts to be happy, fulfilled and fully alive."
2,not good,"this dish rack was an extreme disappointment. It is not stable once put together. the tray underneath it does not drain the water into the sink, it just holds it, the drain tray is smaller then the rack so water drops on the counter, and the rack rust, it is only stainless steel coated."
1,Simple and Amatuerish,"This video is neither for the person who wants to learn how to massage or to be a voyeur watching beautiful people get a nice massage in an aesthetic environment. This is basically a ""what is massage"" and ""what different types there are"" video and not even a good one. This seems to be a home video type production of a massage center somewhere in Australia. You will not learn how to give yourself a massage or anyone else, nor will you enjoy the beautiful people and scenery. You won't even learn much about massage itself. Stick with other videos such as ""Professiona Therapuetic Massage"", ""Full-Body Massage: The complete Home Guide"" and especially, ""A Basic Massage Technique with Ann Kenyon"". Don't waste your time and money here."
4,George Washington film,The movie is great if you don't know much about Washington but it does leave some stuff out. I don't think it mentioned Sally Fairfax even one time and it kind of brushed over some things in his life that I felt were important but otherwise it's a great documentary.
4,GREAT PRODUCTION,"This was a very unique view of a man I have only seen on money and paintings. School and college do not do this man justice. However, in this program you really get a better idea of the man and how antimated he was with his men and in stressful situations."
3,Washington the Warrior,I feel that the authors tried to present a balanced view of Washington. In trying to present this balanced viewpoint I feel they spent too much time on his errors and minimized his accomplishments.
3,Just Like That Review,"In the novel, Just Like That, Hanna is a troubled teenager going through typical challenges for her age. She soon finds herself in a not so typical situation though. With Will's help she is able to sort out and come to terms with it.Hanna and Will are both very likable characters. Through difficult obstacles, Hanna is confused and troubled and you find yourself falling into the action of the book having hope for her. There are many unexpected twists that will keep your interested and wanting to know more.I think the theme for this book is to realize you actions determine your future and to make smart decisions you will be happy with,"
4,Not perfect but a good story,The story is really inspirational. The acting while not great was pretty good in my opinion. Ron Livingston did a good job as the lead. The film was rough at times with cuts and cinematography but the story and Livingston's performance combined with the witty humor make this a film worth watching.
5,A truely amazing and inspiring movie and life!,"This is a truely inspiring movie about a man who has made a difference in many lives. Watch, listen, and learn."
5,Excellent Movie!,"This is an excellent movie -- funny, serious, and educational. We use it in our foster care education programs to talk about diversity and consideration of others."
1,Missed Opportunity,"The biopic aspect of the story is interesting, but everything else--from the acting to the use of music to cue nearly every plot event--is downright ridiculous. Huge waste of time. I couldn't make myself finish it. I'd rather find a well-written account of the events and have a good read instead."
5,Incredible film!,"This is an incredible film. I made it an extra credit assignment for my neuroanatomy students last spring. I bought the DVD when it came out so that I could have more students watch it. I teach in Speech and Hearing Sciences, so the story of a man with hearing loss and his friendship with another man with a cerebral palsy is very relevant. The story is educational, funny, and heart wrenching, as well as being based on a true story."
4,This film captures the attitude and humor of Art Honeyman very well.,"Art and I were very good friends during the 60s at Portland State. I have watched him brace against a wall and dance with us in stoned glory as we partied on weekends. He raged against the war, and injustice, but I don't recall him raging against his life. As we were going to the Hillsborough airport from which I would take him flying, he remarked to his live-in friend, 'I'm going to get high. Literally!' I hope that I was able to serve him as a friend in some small way. The events of life separated us in 1967 and we met only rarely from then on. Now he is gone, and the world should miss him."
4,Superb! Red beans and Rice.,It's great to know that someone knows the way to good eating. Not saturated with meat or garlic. Great read from start to finish.
5,Excellent reference,"This book was recommended by a friend. When I received it in the mail, I could'nt put it down. It has a million details that are useful but could easily be missed in another guide or reference book. Although the advertisements were a bit much, they too were helpful in our decision-making process. Recommended!"
3,"If you sell Alaska, this is a must!","Excellent guide for the travel consultant or traveller. Mile by mile guide, city guide, lots of pertinent information in this publication."
4,Not what I expected,"I bought this as a gift for someone, meant to inspire them while they were thinking about driving the Alaska Highway. While it's comprehensive, and I'm sure a great resource when you're travelling, it looks like one of those free travel guides you'd pick up on the road. It is magazine size (though much thicker) with thin, cheap pages with lots of ads. I'd recommend it if you're travelling, but not as a nice gift for someone else."
4,Essential Reference,"Having lived in Alberta & British Columbia & travelled above the 60th parallel only once, I feel the need to go ""way north"" again. This tome provides excellent information, albiet with quite a bit of embedded advertising. Not a major problem -- many of these towns would have a fraction of the business, were it not for tourism.I'm heading to Dawson City (not Creek) in July & will come back via Haines & Skagway. Looking forward to it."
1,Too much advertising,The Milepost is hard to use due to all the advertising that is inserted into pages. I much prefer the other Alaska book that I purchased which cost less and has better information about camping etc. with no advertising. I would not recommend buying it. If I hadn't cut the map out (which looks like a kiddie map) I would return it.
5,Ultraportable that's better than a netbook,"At 8.5 by 11 inches, fits in my wife's purse.Great keyboard, good screen, more powerful than a netbook, saves on power as a desktop replacement.Is currently running PlayOn and Tonido, acting as a server."
2,Pencil Neck,"I was hoping that this book would be a more detailed guide to penciling. Most of the illustrations were inked, though. It also has a LOT of text, which makes it not so easy to sit and read while trying to actually draw. I would recommend the ""How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way"" over this book."
2,Improperly Titled,"Sadly, the art form within this book is great, but this book totally lacks instruction or better details... I recommend ""How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way"" instead."
3,Useful,"This is a useful guide no doubt, as with many other how-to books, however it's not at all the best I've seen.I'd still recommend getting this book if you are an aspiring artist, because it's always important to stock a library of information within your field(s)."
1,Not What You're Looking For!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I bought two of the books from this series and they were fantastic! (DC Comics Guide to Digitally Drawing Comics & DC Comics Guide to Inking Comics.) I was expecting this book to review the fundamentals of actually penciling comics. As it turns out, there were only two chapter in the entire book devoted to penciling - and none of those actually covered the techniques of penciling. If you're wanting a book to teach you the do's and don't's of penciling comics, then look elsewhere. Epic fail!"
2,disappointing,"after reading a few reviews and the bad luck bride series, I expected more than I got out of this book. I read the whole thing but at times the going was tough as the story lagged and lost my interest at some points. All in all the premise of the book is a good one but the characters were predictable and the style of writing was inferior to some of the other books I've read by this author."
5,Captivating characters,"Loved the characters in the book! Pirates, Texas cowboys and romance wrapped into one story. Mary Margaret St. John is the central female figure surrounded by all these men who turn to mush when she uses her charm on them. Very entertaining read!"
4,Excellent Second Book,"This is yet another ""Examples in C++"" style book.I like the author's style of explaining complex topics. The writing is very fluid and the concepts are explained sufficiently. However, this book is no different than long listing of well-document code!I would recommend this book as a second book after an introductory text in C++. If you are capable of reading C++, this book will give you some insights in developing real-world solutions.If you are a professional programmer who is fairly proficient in C++, you might not need this book. The examples in the book are fairly useful (see table of content), but similar code is available on the web for free. For example, if you want to study programming language issues (garbage collection, compilation), you can easily download an opensource project off the web and study it."
1,Don't waste your time (Negative 5 stars),Don't waste your time;1) The code is available from the publishers site for free (It's not really very complicated stuff and a whole lot of it isn't really even C++)2) Don't even bother with the code - It doesn't work. The simple Garbage collector samples in the second chapter will fail to function - The reasons for the failure show a serious lack of understanding of the standard C++ libraries. Not what you want from the author of a C++ programming book.
4,I like No.6 Disk,"I love the Disk title "" Salve Regina / Cantatas & Motets ""by James Bowman.So I bought these Disks.It's very nice number of 6 , because STABAT MATER is wonderful.and this is nice price at US amazon, because US$150 in Japan!"
3,"Correction to Previous Review, Webmaster please edit","Hosea's wife's name was Gomer, rhymes with Hagar. Webmaster, please edit the mistake in two places in the review.You can see why I did not fill out the opportunity to become a recognized reviewer....Mea CulpaMarietta Pope, Plymouth, NH"
3,Satan,"This is a gory movie. There is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. Its an exploitation Satan film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring, this film would be a nasty classic.Lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse, and the ugly monster, this movie is a snoozer.It's such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims I'd recommend this as a sleep aide.This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every Euro-Satan movie."
4,Enchanting,"I have had this novel for 17 years. Never have I let it go. That should say something for this book.After reading a couple of the reviews, I will agree that there are a couple of scenes that are slightly unbeleivable. Even saying that, the character of Arrah is so strong. She has to be the strongest female character I have ever read. She has more faults than most of the current heroines, which I personally like. Being a writer myself, I do see errors in this novel, but I think it is her 'voice' that gives it so much life.Even though Seaghan, the hero, is portrayed as very strong and masculine, Arrah is the stronger of the two, without making him appear wimpy.Very rare.I found this book at a time in my life when I needed to be stronger than anyone around me, and it gave me that strength.A good book can do that."
2,The passionate side of the Irish,"This is the only book by Elona Malterre that I have ever read. Just like the comments I read for the Celts, this book is full of unnecessary sex. I have to admit that the entire plot/story and characters are very creative, and the only things that kept me reading. I have to say, if you want the passionate side of the Irish, this book is for you, but if you want a nice quiet reading, turn to another alternative."
4,very mellow,"Lots of sounds of nature. Good for when you want to listen to something subtle, like for medatation, or going to sleep, or wish you were out in the forest."
4,Excellent Sci-Fi Detective Series,"Richard Paul Russo's superior series combines the best of the Science Fiction and Mystery genres into one package. Detective Frank Carlucci is an honest cop and a good detective in the hopeless corrupt world of the mid-21st century. He is determined to do the right thing despite the potentially negative consequences. The real strength of the book is the vivid desciptions of the streets of San Francisco that leave you feeling that it is inevitable that the world will turn out this way. Any of the books in this series, which include ""Destroying Angel,"" and ""Carlucci's Heart,"" are well worth owning."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this book to take with me on a trip just recently. It started off promising but ended up being very sub-par. It felt rushed at the end, it was very predictable - after the first 1/3rd of the book it was easy enough to figure out exactly what was the driving crime behind this whole thing.Some of the plot and character actiosn just felt childish and contrived.I would not recommend this book at all."
4,Generic cyberfiction but with an element of realness,Russo's writing reads like a candid conversion at the bar and very real. Carlucci is less of the rehashed hard-boiled detective and seems more like a character from NBC's Law and Order or NYPD Blue. Very believable.
2,Wish it was not broken.,"This item was purchased as a used item. This is okay, except, when the shears arrived they were filthy. No attempts at cleaning them were made, so they had caked on scum stuck to the blade and cutter from having been used on dirty livestock. There were also several teeth broken off of the blade. The worst factor, however, is that the power switch was also broken. It would not remain in the on position, so that it required me to depress it continuously to keep the shears on. The best factor is that there was paperwork included that directed me toward the Oster warranty department. It means more money to repair the shears, but luckily for me, they are reparable. Ultimately, after the repair costs and replacement blade, there is no savings from purchasing these used as I ended up paying what I would have for new shears.What I learned in this transaction is, I should have considered the price as an indicator. Buyer beware!"
3,a good sophomore-level book,"a nice sophomore-level book. it introduces basic set theory and logic concepts, but at ""gentle"" pace. the type of book that would be used at a liberal arts college, but not at a ""real"" engineering school. has a nice examples and does a decent job in explaining the basics."
3,disappointing.,"this product was not as good quality as expected. Not awful, but disappointing.The 'cracker' arms are thick and bulky to operate."
3,Nice starter kit!!!,"Add power to your Pocket PC with this collection of programs for professionals. With 300 tools and applications you can write and send SMS messages, display spreadsheets and Word documents as charts, create and edit databases, and much more. It even includes programs for special interests and hobbies: music, photography, health and nutrition, sports, stocks, and investments"
1,DO NOT BUY A SONY CLIE TJ27!!!,"The Clie TJ27 is a piece of garbage!!! I wish I had stuck w/Palm. Not only do very essential features not work, but Sony product support is worthless and time consuming. Here is a list of what is not working:1. Power/Hold button does not correctly, therefore the screen backlight is always off. I've trouble shooted this w/Sony, the power button is not working correctly & they confirm this2. The 'capture' button for the camera is inoperable.3. Silk screen area is unresponsive, rendering this PDA worthless4. Sony support sucks. As I write this, I have been on the phone w/them on hold for over 2 hours!I have attempted to return the Clie to the place of purchase, but they would not take it because I bought it 38 days ago & their return policy is 30 days. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A SONY PRODUCT ON ANY KIND!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! GET A PALM OR HANDSPRING!!!"
1,back light does not work,13 months ago ago I bought a Sony clie tj-35The back light doesn't work and I am told it from their tech support website it is going to cost me $124.00 to fix it.I am going to buy a palm tungsten E. I feel I've been ripped off.
1,No support services! - Avoid this Sony product!,My battery was non-servicable after a year. Battery is very difficult to get and change out. No one wants to talk about it ... I thought the COMPAQ PDA I bought was bad! I never expected this level of non-support from SONY. Get a Palm!
2,"Problems, problems, ...","First I could not sync. Returned the unit to Sony for repair (warranty). Then they forgot to ship the sync cable back with the unit. Now, after the warranty period, the camera on the Clié no longer works - a message says ""the lens cover is closed"" but it is not... So I can't use the camera in the unit any more. I will go back to Palm next time..."
1,Lousy Software Support,"If you want to synchronize with Outlook or Lotus Notes- you can't get your past appointments to show on the handheld. There is a patch provided for Outlook 2003 but not for 2002 which is what I have. I bought my handheld back in April, and just figured this out.I don't know if Intellisync or Sony will help me since I haven't gotten a response from either one yet- but I am not holding my breath.VERY FRUSTRATING"
4,very pleased,"happy with product and seller, this is a hard item to find. But as Amazon to the rescue."
2,Pretty to look at....,"One of the things that originally attracted me to the Clie was its sleek styling and compact design, especially since I carry it everywhere I go. However, after the disappointing technical/customer service I've received from Sony (ignoring my e-mails) and the difficulty in finding a replacement stylus for this product, I would not recommend buying this handheld. Even if Sony is discontinuing its handheld line, they should have some sense of loyalty to their customers and continue to support their product. After going to four electronics stores and visting the Amazon and Sonystyle websites, I am still without a replacement stylus (extends & retracts) for this product. If customer service and ease in obtaining replacement parts is a consideration in your purchase of a handheld, don't waste your money on Sony."
4,Good Value,"I replaced my Palm 105m with the TJ27 shortly after the first of the year. It's a good value for the $200 price tag. Of course, it has the usual fearures such as addreess book, calendar, etc.I also like the built-in digital camera (the picture may lack some quality, but it's quite good for everyday use). I also can give the back light screens high marks. The only two negatives are the battery has to be recharged frequently and unlike the plam there's no free built-in games. For your everyday use this is a great little unit. One last thing - their customer support: once you finally get through Sony's stupid phone menu and speak to a real live person, they are friendly and helpful. I had a small problem with the Hot Sinc and they fixed it right away."
2,TJ27 - Fragile Glass,"I've had my Clie TJ27 for 3 weeks and generally liked it. However, the glass cracked when I left it in my vehicle due to the heat (about 80 deg F) outside. Customer Service wasn't interested, claimed it had been abused because I left it in my vehicle and so not covered by the warranty! Also, the replacement glass was quoted at $130.Just note that Customer Service/Warranty don't count for much on this product, spare parts/repair costs are ""over the top"" and the glass is fragile."
4,MAC Compatibility Update,"I have had my TJ27 all of one day, so I am withholding the 5th star until I have a chance to get to know it better. But so far I love it! I had a Visor Prism, and this has all the functionality of that and more. With all that you get, including the camera (which I plan to use for info-gathering purposes rather than artistic ones), it does seem like a great deal.REGARDING MAC COMPATIBILITY--The TJ27 will NOT sync to a Mac without MissingSync. I purchased the software online, downloaded it, and was able to sync my Clie all in about 15 minutes. The software is $30 ($40 if you need it on CD). Even with that, I consider the Clie an excellent deal."
4,Great for the Price,"I had a Handspring Visor Edge and the battery died on me, so, I thought it was about time to upgrade my PDA. I purchased the Sony PEG TJ27. I was shocked on how easy it was to convert all of my calendar and addresses information from my old PDA to my new one. The jog dial is very nice and the camera is a nice perk. The camera does not compare to a real digital camera, but it is fun to have. I do think that I should have paid the extra $100 to get the PEG TJ37 with the sound and wireless capabilities, but overall I enjoy my new PDA and I am very happy with my decision. As far as battery life, I have not yet tested, but it does require a lot more charging than the Handspring Visor Edge."
3,beware,"I have a PEG-TJ37 and like another reviewer, my back-light has quit. I think it is because the screws fall out of the casing. So..beware. I love the unit though and hope to replace it on e-bay. Good MP3 player, decent low-res camera, and unlimited memory if you don't mind using memory sticks. This is the second CLIE I have owned and both were trouble-free for about 2 years."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I purchased my Sony PEG TJ27 and it worked great for the first 6 months then the battery died, then the screen light phased out. What a nightmare, Spend the extra money for a PALM, you'll be much happier."
3,Doesn't fit a large downtube,"The product was good at its price, however there was no warning that it would not fit a downtube on a typical carbon fiber bike. Also, there is no ""adapter"" piece. As a result I had to return it. Should try the Pro or Elite if you have such a bike"
4,It works!,"For an in-shop bicycle stand, there are better choices. But for portability, and at the price, this is a winner. It works! And you can fold it up and easily take it with you to work on your bike where ever you need to do that."
3,Gets the job done but not so versatile,"For maintenance that requires some torque/leverage, this stand is hard to work with. The hook for the downtube is useless unless you have something fat enough for it to grip but thin enough to fit in the chassis. I wind up wrapping old tire tube around the middle of the downtube to try to get it to hold on to the bike, but it still tends to want to tip it from side to side. For the price, it is ok; I would probably spend a little more if I had the choice to make again. For frequent maintenance this stand can be frustrating, but for minor tune-ups it works."
4,Topeak Bike Repair Stand,"Shipping was speedy, and I was impressed with the quality when it arrived. It's certainly less expensive than most of the other repair stands I researched, and with the basic repairs and minimum maintenance I perform on my bike - it's perfect!"
4,Good bike repair stand at a good price.,"For the price of this stand you can't ask or anything more. The bike rests right in the middle of the stand so there's no tipping or falling over of the stand and the front wheel hooks really helps with the stability. It would've been even better if a parts tray could've been added, but no complaints here."
4,Great product - needs a little practice to get right,"I am very happy with this tie dye kit and the video that comes with it. We have tie dyed 4 children's shirts so far with great success. However, we used much more dye than I anticipated. I was hoping to get 12 children's shirts dyed (4 one week with one child and 8 the next week with a younger sibling)but we used more than half the dye for the first 4 shirts. I am sure we used more than needed as the colors really soak in and blend together during the 12-24 hour setting period. We allowed the children (9-10years old) to apply dyes by themselves and hence some went a little overboard. But since the video just always shows the beginning of the process, it is hard to know how much dye is adequate until you have practiced yourself. I will buy this product (or at least the dyes)again as the children loved the process and the shirts turned out great!"
5,Fantastic starter kit,"Purchased as a gift for my 11 year old niece. It had everything you could want, and the clothes she dyed turned out beautifully."
5,Tie Dye Day,"I hold a tie dye day at the end of the school year with my kids plus another family. We used this kit last year and it was a HUGE hit! ages 3-9 handled the mustard-like squeeze bottles with ease to create BEAUTIFUL tie dye shirts, socks, towels- pretty much everything we could get our hands on! The dye is brilliant and stays that way through many washes - ours are now a year old and look brand new! Kids are asking when the next party will be so I'm about to buy this years kit and thought I'd review! GREAT kit - don't hesitate!"
3,Only made 5 shirts,"This kit is great except it doesn't have enough dye for larger shirts. It only made 5 shirts and a pair of socks for me, and that was going lightly on the dye. Maybe it makes 10-15 children's shirts, but by no means makes 10-15 extra large adult shirts."
4,"lots of fun, comes with a short DVD too!","The kit has some good quality dispensing bottles, an excellent and short DVD, and great die. However, the blue gloves included were too cheaply made, and tore just putting them on. Do yourself a favor and invest in some decent gloves, because you don't want this die getting on your hands.The included rubber bands were nice, and could be easily doubled up for small children's clothes.Speaking of kids, my 5 and 4 year old boys easily contributed (with the proper protection, of course).The DVD was a bonus, because it went over several designs, and showed the finished product (unlike this $10Tie Dye! The How-To BookI bought from Amazon)"
4,Much better then drug store dye!,"I have tie-dyed many times, always with RIT dye. Never again, this is SO much better!!! The colors are brighter, they don't bleed very much so the white parts stay white, and the dye rinses out of the shirt right away so finishing the shirts is easier. I'm confident I won't ruin any other clothes when i wash the shirts in the future. The directions seemed clear and accurate. The DVD didn't work in my computer (skipped a lot) but I watched a tutorial on youtube. My only problem was that there wasn't enough dye! I got maybe 5 fully dyed adult XL tee shirts out of each kit, and we ran out of yellow way too soon. (It takes a lot more yellow then red to make orange, and lots more yellow then blue to make green. The extra color-mixing bottle is helpful!)The soda ash and bottles are reusable, so next time I will order more dye separately, especially yellow. Other than that, we were thrilled!"
5,Tie dye,I have enjoyed using this tie dye kit. The instructions were easy to follow and my tie dye shirts came out nice. I would suggest this item to anyone!
4,Great And Reccomended,This kit is amazing although it wasnt enough dye for 15 shirts ...a little less. i wish this kit had one more bottle because i would like to have orange and prple at the same time.. but the overall review is really good :)
4,Perfect BUT...,"This tie-dye kit is perfect! Instructions (in writing and demonstrations on DVD), rubber bands, soda ash, bright dye... This kit definitely provides everything besides the 100% cotton items needed for dying.My only complaint is that it is a FAR CRY from the 15 shirts advertised that it can do. I normally wouldn't complain because the label says ""UP TO 15 Shirts"" BUT what they fail to mention is that they are probably very small shirts. I was able to use the dye in moderation and get 3 toddler shirts, 2 men's XL's and one women's L long sleeve.I wouldn't dare soak 15 shirts in the soda ash; just to be left with almost ruined t shirts if you have no more spare dye. Soda ash can damage the clothes if left in longer than the 20-25 min suggested. It can weaken the fibers of the shirts."
5,Absolutely fantastic product!!,"We just purchased and used this Tye Dye kit for a birthday party (for 7 year olds). It was wonderful in every way! Easy to follow printed instructions. Very helpful DVD. Very well packaged (making the whole project easy). And BEAUTIFUL quality dyes, even after machine washing! I would HIGHLY recommend this Tye Dye kit to anyone wanting to make their own Tye Dye things!!"
4,"Great kit with vibrant colors, won't do 15 adult shirts as advertised","I received this kit as a gift & shared it with friends. It is a great product & there was plenty of soda ash for us, just not enough dye! We did mostly kids stuff, but nowhere near 15 adult shirts worth, I think we got about 8 infant/toddler-sized things done & maybe 3 adult-sized things done. Overall a great deal though."
2,smells and feels good,I used this and the cream just to make sure I was not getting stretch marks. I used it every night every morning. last month....got stretch marks. didn't work for me :(
1,Stained My Dress,"I used the Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil on my breasts and belly, waited 15 min. and then put my dress on. The oil stained my dress, not sure if it will come out since I washed and dried it before noticing the stains. I have now sprayed a stain remover on my dress and will wash it again. Also, when you pour the oil out you have to be careful because it drips down the side of the bottle. I will be trying lotion next, no more oil for me. I cannot return this product to the individual seller I purchased from because they do not accept returns of an item that has been opened so I have contacted the company to see what they can do for me."
4,Feels and smells great!,"Absolutly loved this during my pregnancy! I still got stretch marks but I know it was inevitable, but it feels so good on and smells fabulous."
3,Fine . . .but now WOW,"Like most expecting moms, I was paranoid about stretch marks. I purchased this hoping it would help keep those pesky marks at bay. I'm not sure if it helped or didn't. I did moisturize but I felt more greasy than anything else."
1,"Very Bad Business, order from another vendor!","Item showed up broken, package leaking. They packaged it in a tiny box with mini styrofoams instead of bubble wrap. I cut my finger in an attempt to save the bottle that I soon saw was in pieces. Beauty Bridge did not take full responsibility. Blamed USPS and then blamed me for not inspecting the package and not rejecting it. Thing is... the package was dropped off on my doorstep. There was not an option to sign or review the package before accepting it. Beauty Bridge even suggested that I keep the broken peices and packaging for further investigation. Which of course I did! They are very unprofessional, bad business and customer service is beyond belief. This item is sold from many other vendors. Please save yourself the time. I should've read reviews for this company before ordering from them... my mistake."
2,well that didn't work!!,"I bought this literally as I got pregnant and was applying it every day like it says on the bottle, however it didn't keep the dreaded stretch marks away and I am now the owner of a stomach full of horrible stretch marks, personally the only thing going for this product is that it smells nice and makes your skin soft and it was dispatched quickly and efficiently."
5,love this stuff!,"This is my second bottle and I love this stuff! Smells great, soaks in the skin fast and I put it on at least 2 times a day! Definitely recommended"
4,Great product,I love my new tummy rub. It absorbs fast and the smell is nice and light. As much as I do love the product I probably wont be purchasing again because the amount you get for the spendy price would burn through my wallet fast.
4,"Product is great, just too pricey","If money is not an object to you, this would be your product. I do have to admit, this oil does last long. What I ended up doing was using this with another product for (a stretch mark prevention cream) to make it last even longer. Both my mom and my sis had stretch marks so I thought I was doomed to have them. Thank God, I didn't. I think it was the combination of using 3 or 4 different creams/oil and the fact that I only gained 25 lbs total. I also delivered at 37 weeks! Who knows!"
4,I will buy again,"Both my mother and sister had stretch marks so I figured I was doomed, but I had to try anyway. I used this oil around the beginning of my second trimester untill I delivered. I didn't get stretch marks until the last 2-3 weeks of my pregnancy and they weren't very bad, but that wasn't surprising since my baby and I were small. What DID surprise me was how fast they went away even though I didn't use it much after I gave birth. 19 months later I can't see them at all and I'm going to purchase another bottle for bump number 2."
2,It Doesn't Work for Me,"The first time I used the product, everything seemed great: the smell is good and my tummy felt hydrated. However, starting from the second use, I gradually developed an itch on my tummy. I don't have a history of allergy to anything, but this oil gave me such an unbearable itching sensation that after two weeks of use I had to stop. I then switched to another product and the itch stopped. The time I used this oil was too short to tell whether it is effective in stretchmark prevention, but I can tell you it is not for everybody. :("
3,Enjoyed using this product,"I used the Tummy Rub twice day from my 2nd Trimester on. Smells great but is a little oily!in my LATE 3rd trimester, I received two stretch marks. Whether or not you get stretch marks during pregnancy is up to genetics, not a $30 bottle of oil."
1,Did not work.,Didnt work for me I would slather my tummy with this oil and the butter to morning ang evening everyday and I still got a lot of stretch marks.. =(
4,I love it but the smell...,I ordered this after reading many reviews. For some reason I never paid much attention to any that remarked about the scent. When you first put it on it smells like citrus peels (orange mixed with lemon) or lemon starburst. After its had a while to soak in to my skin I feel like I have a teenage boy following me around. Smells very musky and makes me want to remove it. If I was still had morning sickness I do not think I could use it. The oil is very heavy but absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft. I use the stretch mark butter with this at the same time. I hope I can get use to the smell because I do love how it makes my skin feel.
4,Strong smelling,"Mama Mio Tummy rub oil works well. Swore by it during my first pregnancy. I Purchased another bottle my second pregnancy and because of 40 week morning sickness and a sensitivity to smell, I wasn't able to use it again.It is getting plenty of use now as a moisturizer and I love the smell. I don't recommend it for anyone (partners included) who might be bothered by strong or distinctive smells."
4,"Stretch marks aren't preventable, but this stuff is nice!","I've loved using the Mama Mio Tummy rub because it smells great and soothes my itchy belly. However, if you're prone to stretch marks and you get big enough then you get stretch marks. My dermatologist told me there is nothing I could do to prevent stretch marks, but that using this may help them from being too bad. I'm 31 weeks pregnant with twins and up 30 pounds and the stretch marks just started appearing, even after using the Mama Mio and Palmer's every day for months. Maybe they'd be worse if I hadn't used this stuff?? Regardless, the oil relieves the itchiness and burning. I find it very soothing. If anything actually prevented stretch marks all together then I would give it 5 stars, but that product doesn't exist!"
5,Love this product,"I love this oil. I started using a product called ""Beauty for ashes tummy oil"" this product was good but I thought it was very expensive at $56 which includs tax and shipping. I then looked on amazon for products that had similar ingredient's. I read the reviews on this oil and thought I would try it. I started using this product when I was 3 months. I am now 5 months pregnant and no stretch marks. I did get some stretch marks on my lower back, buttocks, and inner thighs from teenage years. So, I'm hoping that as I get bigger this product continues to work. It feels good on my skin and it also has a pleasant scent."
1,A MOTHER'S REVENGE,This is a great movie but can not be watched in the U.S.A. BECAUSE OF THE STUPID REGION 2. If the movie is made in the U.S.A. it stands to reason it should be available here in the U.S.A. and if someone from another country want to watch it why can't they have to be the ones to get it in a certain region. This is so aggravating that we get screwed out of owning great movies!!
1,"Poorly writen, filled with errors, very long, poorly indexed","We used this book in a graduate course at UCLA. The professor had to hand out a list of all the errors we encountered, and it was about ten pages typewritten. The professor, Geoff Mess, wrote at the top of this list that many of the students had complained about this book, and that it was a disappointment to him as well. I often found myself scanning hundreds of pages in search of what should have been contained in their sparse index. The book is unnecessarily long and wordy for the matter covered. In the introduction, the authors mention that they invite comments from the readers. It seems that they depend on their readers to correct their copious errors and their poor writing."
3,Not for making baby food,"I bought this food processor with the intention of making baby food for my 6 month old son. I've found that it does not do a good job pureeing the food, so he will gag and cough most of it up. I think he'll be fine with it by the time he is 10 months old or so, but if you are looking for a food processor that does a good job of pureeing food I would not recommend this. However, everything else I've used it for has been fabulous and it really is nice having one with such a large cup capacity. I also agree with others - it is relatively easy to clean."
4,great for the price,"It's easy to use and works great. The only drawback is that I can't store it under the cabinet fully assembled, it's to tall."
2,Broken and Unhappy,"I have had this monster for a couple of years but only recently started using it regularly. As soon as I did, the lid grooves that slip it into the bowl broke off. I still tried to use it the other day to puree - maybe the first time I've done this - and the liquid squirted all over the kitchen outside the top of the lid. The crazy thing that it was not through the bowl and the lid, but between the side of the lid and the top of the lid! It had nothing to do with the broken clips.I intended to buy a new lid (at abtecparts com which carries them), but after reading the reviews and pricing out the replacement part, I think I'll get a new processor.This thing does a great job on cookie dough, though. I also used it to make pesto and that was not a problem."
3,Esther Bunny,"An excelleny product!! Previously owned a Cusinart and I really like the Big Mouth much better. The extra wide mouth saves time in preperation, is easily cleaned and I'm just super happy with it."
2,"Nice, but watch out!","I loved this processor at first, it was great to shread cheese and slice potatos. But do not drop it, it is made of very cheep plastic. I droped my lid and it cracked in several places, now it is no good, i have looked every where to find a replacement, and there is no way you can order parts. DO NOT DROP THE LID OR THE BOWL."
4,Well Worth It.,This is a great product and well worth the money spent especially if you spend a lot time in the kitchen.
4,EXCELLENT FOOD PROCESSOR,I GIFTED THIS PROCESSOR TO MY SON IN ST. LOUIS. HE IS SATISFIED WITH IT'S PERFORMANCE.
5,Big Mouth food processor,My husband got this to use at his German restaurant - he said he's tired of chopping everything by hand after 25 years! He loves the processor especially the large opening and the ease of use. Would recommend to anyone seeking a good processor.
3,Light plastic - Might break,This spoon rest was very beautiful but the plastic seems a bit thin to be placing it on a stove. I hope it doesn't melt. I gave it as a gift with my fingers crossed...
2,A poor ballet film,Plisetskaya deserves 5 stars but this is a very poor ballet filmThe first act is heavily cut and there are too many shots of theaudience even in such important scenes as the second act and black swan pas de deux and also many shots from the stage showingthe back of the dancers and the theater. The audio and the video are poor.
3,"Great performance,bad filming and sound","Having been lucky enough to have seeen Plisetskaia in Carmen (in Buenos Aires), I was so looking forward to this DVD.Pity the filming and sound are so bad, plus the fact that the cameraman kept showing faces of the audience during critical passages; the ""tempo""of the first and 3rd.acts way too fast. But you can still see her splendid Odette/Odile.I can only imagine what it would have been if had been filmed as it should. Anybody who has seen The Red Shoes (filmed in the40""I believe)knows what good ballet filming is."
2,Don't waste your time on this one!,"Almost every other dvd with Plisetskaya is superior to this one. Maya Plisetskaya ia a great dancer and well worth seeing and studying, but if you want to see her dance, see ""Plisetskaya Dances"",""Anna Karenina"", or her version of ""Carmen"". This Swan Lake is very poorly presented. The only reason to purchase this dvd is if you must have a sample of her Odette/Odile, then go ahead, but don't expect much."
1,Frustrated,"I did not receive the item. Please inform me the status of the same and estimated delivery date,Hernàn Llosas"
3,How I saved the President.,Cute story line for kids under 11 years old.Bradley Pierce is a good boy actor andhe should go far in the industry.
4,O.K but not as great as what I expeced.,"Great to see these videos after all these years. However the transfer is bad quality, grainy, color washed out. Balls to the Walls video is in black and white, I remember it in color on MTV. The videos begin with some idiot narrator talking jibberish that has little to do with the band or video. Would have been nice to remove that. The concert footage is poorly lit and hard to see, but the band sounds so much like the albums that you think they are lip synching. The interview section has exactly one sentence from Udo and alot of ""the new album/next concert will be great"" prattle from the uninteresting other menbers of the band. I realize Accept does not have the fan base and finances to do this up right, but the whole effort feels slapped together for quick cash."
3,"good, but...","I bought this scale to replace an older Salter scale I had used for years. (the battery finally gave out and wasn't replaceable). Love this scale--when the battery isn't dead! I've only had it about 3 weeks, and have already had to replace the battery twice!!!"
5,Great Scale,"My old Salter scale died after many years of use. I needed to replace it and after searching and reviewing scales, I decided to go with a new Salter and we love the improved design.From weighing our meats to flour for our baking, you can't go wrong with this work horse.We highly recommend this product."
1,I sent it back,"I was disappointed with this item. It showed the weight in fractions instead of decimals and it turned off too quickly on it's own. I ended up ordering a model that was a little more expensive but worth every penny. The ""help"" was cute when you turned it on, but reminded me that it just wasn't very good quality. I ended up ordering the Escali model that has the optional AC adapter, a bigger display, back light, decimal read out, and back light if I need it. This model was just too disappointing and caused frustration."
1,This is not the Salter 6055!,"This is probably a great scale, however this is not the scale I received when I placed my order. The scale I was sent has a rectangular platform and it does not stand on its side for storage (the feature that sold this scale for me) though the box clearly lists it as model #6055.When I tried to get the correct scale I e-mailed to explain the problem, but was sent the same rectangular scale AGAIN."
1,Pray that you never need service,"The 11-lb Salter scale is very nice as long as it works. On our scale, four sectors of the LCD display quit working after 2 years making it impossible to use. Salter scales are made in the UK and they no longer have a factory distributor in the USA. Salter is now represented by Taylor which has its own line of scales and they will not honor the Salter warranty. So the Salter 10-year warranty is a bad joke. I was told if I ship my scale to England and pay the return postage ($30 each way), Salter will fix it ""free."" If you're looking for a scale, get one from Oxo; at least they're based in the USA."
2,"Small Display, Very slow Calibration","I bought and used this scale for a few months to measure food quantities at each meal for a new fitness diet. The measurements and features worked great. The two main drawbacks (that led me to replace it with the Escali Primo) are:(1) the very small display size -- I have ""young"" eyes, so if I'm having trouble reading it, I'm sure many others would.(2) very slow calibration time (around 5-10 seconds average, but sometimes up to 20 seconds if it ""feels"" unstable), every time you turn on or tare. (This gets really old when you're measuring 5-6 different food items.)"
1,Best Fryer Cookbook,"I PAID FOR 2 COOKBOOKS but ONLY RECEIVED ONE. I also ordered TWO Fryers...thank you, my son and DIL are pleased and rate the product 5 Star. I wouold like my 2nd cookbook for them...as their WEDDING IS JULY 24TH."
5,good,is a good book lots of fun recipes i realy like the doghnut section but theres lots of others to choose from i would recomend this book if you like to deep fry
3,A Few Novel Ideas,"I used a few of the recipes in this book and they worked out well. Some repitition, but otherwise worth having."
5,Awesome,"I like this book, easy recipe's and allot of them. Whoever thought up the small size was a genius. A large cookbook is hard to store. This little guy packs allot in a small package. Totally recommend."
3,Seems to be good recipes; zero images.,"While the recipes seem to sound good, in this day and age not having images of the cooked product is kind of backwards.Definitely NOT the BEST FRY BOOK EVER...but not bad.Still, certainly a throw back in comparison to modern culinary books."
3,A good BASIC frying cookbook,"This book does a good job of covering the basics of frying, but I confess I wanted more detailed knowledge of frying. I wanted to understand better the ramifications of using different oils, or different batters, and what temperatures were the best for specific use.The recipes cover a broad range of different types of food, and look like simple, solid recipes. They are certainly not too complex for any cook to undertake.The discussion of the advantages of the different models of fryers is already dated, but offers some good pointers on what to look for.If you have not done a lot of frying or do not own a deep fryer, this is a good basic investment. Otherwise, you may want something with more details.RECOMMENDED"
1,fry cooker recipes,"Unfortunately, the look of the book was very dated. No good photos of the recipes. Not a book I would recommend to anyone else. There are much better and healthier recipes on the market today."
1,Quality is unacceptable,"I ordered the item and was very disappointed after receiving the item.1. The shipping was very sloppy. The product was tightly wrapped in a cheap plastic bag without protection(considering this is a electronic device)2. The product looked old and the copyright was ended at 2006 hinting it's be in store for a long while. Upon opening it, one of the battery was leaking chemical indicating indeed, the product must be in storage for a long time.3. Using my own battery, I tried the device and right the way, couple of words I entered had no sounds.I requested a full refund and was told that, based on the store policy, I am responsible for the shipping even though it's defective, and I was told that, when I returned the product, I better make sure I have a tracking number.Well, what can I say?"
4,ECTACO EC300T,The spoken English portion of the talking dictionary is not always easy to understand. It sounds like a machine. The Chinese people using it gave it very high marks and use it constantly for high school homework when they come across a new word while reading. Their parents also have one and they use it daily when they hear new words. It's easy to use and is a great buy. It does all that we wanted it to do.
3,This item is not convenient to use,I think this electronical dictionary is not convenient to use. The key of keyboard is too small and insensitive. Its reaction is also too slow.
1,Weak Magnets,I've purchased multiple Therion products and I find that unless you buy their most expensive model the magnets used in these products are so weak they are almost useless.
1,Very Cool - Price is wrong,"This is a very cool toy. If it was just a toy rating I'd give it 5 stars. The current price of near 60 bucks is way to high. I picked up this three piece set at a warehouse store this weekend for 17 bucks and each individual potato is only 8 bucks a piece.This rocks. The case is cool and my two year loves the giant potato to play with, just don't pay more then 25 bucks for it is all."
4,"Oh, Gee, One Canoli","Even though I'm an avid collector of all things potato, 99 dollars for this set is a bit rich for me. Instead I bought a used set on Ebay for considerably less. Since I'm also an odd ball who hangs Potato Heads in the trees on Spud Acres, I was most interested in the large Darth Tater for its size and visibility.The trio of space spuds inside the large Darth are great collector items and probably fun for little ones who like to make funny configurations. I keep the regulation sized spaced potatoes at work, where the students distort my tater figures into all sorts of weird configurations when I'm not looking. With an active imagination, all sorts of looks are possible."
1,Ouch! Phewy! Ughhhh!,"This is almost certainly the worst film I have seen in ten years. Though I spent real money to purchase it on this site, I discarded it, unrewound, immediately after it was [mercifully] over. The film starts out reasonably enough. A killer starts to plague the arts community of a metropolitan area. This burg appears to be New York in the opening credits but very soon becomes Toronto. The killer starts to kill artists and those associated with artists by painting their dead bodies into a still life. After the first murder, a love affair and some false leads develop that fool you into thinking a real movie is developing, but the whole plot degenerates into absurdity as it progresses. Police don't question people about crimes. Love affairs disintegrate without explanation. And finally, the killer is revealed to be.... Oh why spoil it? Buy it and torture yourself."
4,"Love it, but...","Great can, wonderful vibrant graphics, larger size than expected, high quality. Lost a star because the bottom rusts! Just like the shave cream cans in the shower used to. We have this in our Ohio State bathroom that's just off the Ohio State man cave. The moisture in the bathroom has caused a rust ring where the trash can sits. Go bucks!"
3,good for certain types of shoes,"These liners are really good for loafers or other slip on shoes that have more coverage in the upper foot area and on the sides of the shoe. They don't slip and feel comfortable. They are not as great for shoes like ballet flats, where they show more."
2,Not that good of a product,"The sleeve was way too small for my big toe and it stretched a bit but if i had tried to push it on, it would have hurt so much"
2,Nice when new....,"As an amateur soccer player, occasionally I hurt my toenails and well, loose some of them. Using sandals when your toe is growing is really not a nice view for others, so I bought these more as an esthetical item and at the same time to protect my growing newborn nails. The protectos look great for the first three to four uses, then become dirty and no matter how you wash them, opaque stains perdure making them useless for the main purpose I bought them (Making my hurt toes look decent). They are actually disposable once the get dirty, making them an expensive disposable toe protector. Will look for other options in the future."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"Basically the product is well constructed, but I needed cushioning on the big toe and this simply was too tight a fit."
3,Toe Protector,"Packaging was better than the drugstore version. However, it was not that much less expensive. I would not buy it again."
3,"works great,but falling apart","I got this for a callous I kept getting on my big toe. It works great and is easy to put on,but after 1 week the gel started to tear and fall out,so I switched to a cheap insole"
3,One more size please,"Good product, not too cheap, but too tight on my toe and quite uncomfortable, one larger size would make it perfect."
2,Too tight for a bigger hallux (big toe).,"I bought this item because I injured my big toe by dropping a mirror on it. My nail is damaged, black and painful. However, this toe cap is so tight that my toe started bleeding again as soon as I rolled it over the toe. It may be good for a little finger (pinky), but way too tight for a big toe, which is displayed in the picture. I do have a larger sized big toe though, so it may work for you if you have a smaller big toe."
4,Handy and works great!,"I bought this to protect the end of a very sensitive toe due to an old injury. It does the trick. It's thick, but not too thick or bulky. It turns the skin a little white, like a band-aid does on your finger, but it doesn't feel sweaty or anything. It was a little pricey, and you have to be careful not to lose it. Nice that you can cut it off to the correct length, too."
2,Not WorthThe Money,"I personally didn't think this product did the job. After putting it on my big toe and put my shoe on, my ingrown toe nail still hurt. It might have been the seam at the top of the product rubbing against the shoe, but for me, I won't be buying this product again."
4,Not bad little book. A tad out dated.,Pretty good guide. Would like these books to be updated quicker than they seem to be. Not just newer copy right dates but the most up to date information and references. Otherwise....better than a lot and you can't go wrong with it in general terms. Also remember every individual has a different or slightly different situation and out come with diets and treatments when they are diagnosed with diabetes. Take care and remember what works for one doesn't always work for all.
4,A Chorus of Cultures,"What a nice book this is! ""A Chorus of Cultures"" has hundreds of multicultural poems and activities that will greatly enhance a primary classroom's literacy program. The book is organized by months, making it easy to plan and incorporate the poetry into your daily activities. It also has several indexes to help locate poems. Some of the poems are too difficult for the younger children, and I found myself having to explain some of the poems to my first graders, but it is easy enough to pick and choose what to use. I found the ""Developing Literacy"" activities most helpful, and the book includes poems written by children, which greatly impressed my students!"
2,Parables,The first Parable was very nice. After that it was just paranoid producing interpretations of the new testament. If you are a fundamentalist you will love it.
4,Garfield wins again!,"Although a used book, the book is in great shape and at a great price. We enjoyed this book very much."
3,Okay,"This book is, in comparison to the other Garfield comics, not as great as I hoped it would be. The puns and jokes throughout the entire book seemed a bit too stressed. The jokes weren't surprising, and could also be called ""predictable"". However, Garfield has always been a favorite of mine, so I'm sure that there will later be a coming book filled with great strips."
5,Great Price Great Product,Great product. Great price. Would buy from this seller again. Fast shipping You cannot go wrong with these blades as they stay very cool when using. I groom/show Standard Poodles and only use Oster blades.
1,Canterbury Tales,"The book that arrived was not the one I ordered, though I didn't discover it until the class began. The one in the picture is in modern english. the one I got was middle english and unintelligible to all, other than middle english scholars."
5,Great book,I really love this book. It's was easy for my 3 and 4 year old to understand. Each value is only 2 or 3 pages long with lots of pictures. I like how they had a section on how the value relates to the bible and how God wants us to live and a section for ways to practice a value at home and at school. It's a great teaching tool.
4,HOYA makes consistently reliable and affordable filters,This is my fourth Hoya filter. I keep coming back to them because they use real coated glass that keeps accurate colors. And the price is always right.
4,Cinderella glass slippers,My husband and I went as Cinderella and Prince Charming. We won third prize. The shoes made the outfit. Everyone loved them. Thank you Amazon.con.
4,If ever you need a girls glass slipper...,"...these are the ones to buy! I thought at first that they were a bit expensive($28.00)for a one time performance but they are quite beautiful, well made and realistic looking. They are also quite comfy according to the young actress who wore them in our school play. I would have preferred the sizes be specific with a greater variety of choices rather than small, medium and large."
4,Too expensive and slow for what it is.,"There are much smaller pieces in this set then I thought. Had to remove them for my younger son as they are a chocking hazard.But overall, I continue to be disappointed on how long it actually takes to get them once ordered compared to other things shipped the same method. And lastly, in my opinion for 10-pieces they are overpriced so I won't buy any of them again, I'll just buy more letter and numbers which are a better deal."
3,"Good test, lacking list of careers","I took all the tests and ranked both Superior in Clerical (C) and Social (S). I believed that these scores and analyzation were accurate, but the list of matching careers was lacking. For example, the only two careers listed in the CS cluster that requires college is College Financial-Aid Officer and Religious-Activities Director. The only career listed in the CS cluster that requires graduate school is Patients' Librarian. I am not interested in any of these three careers, but I am a college graduate and I am interested in graduate school. What now? A longer list of careers, with detailed descriptions, would have been appreciated."
5,This Book Made An Impact On My Life!,"Once in awhile a book comes along that impacts one's thinking and decisions long-term. Finishing my second year at a liberals arts university I was desperate for focus. I took a series of tests and read other books designed to help me gain clarity into the career I should choose. Of all the tests I completed this was the least time consuming and I believe most accurate. Some of the other evaluations concentrated on interests (I knew them already) others on aptitude, this book blended both remarkably. The career this book pointed me toward was so unique I had to research it. After eleven years of excelling in my field and enjoying my job everyday I'm often grateful to Linda Gale. I can highly recommend this book to individuals looking to identify and use their talents more efficiently. I give this book to potential employees before hiring and I bought copies for my entire church youth group."
5,Discover what you're best at,I am presently using this book in realationship with my Transition Ministry. This will help guide the unemployed or underemployed in which direction they should place their attention in searching for job oppurinites.Linda Gale system will open some people eyes and build their self confidence.Thank you for a great tool
2,DON'T Discover What You're Best at!,"This book just gives you the standard little logic tests and addition problems and so on, minor skill tests. If you have any experience at all, you already know how to do most of these things--or you need to finish high school. I can do those things, because I have had to, not because I am 'best' at them. This book was absolutely no help to me."
5,helpful,This book is great for help in determing where your strengths are. A good book for anyone looking for a career path or vocation. The tests were very thorough.
2,Doesn't account for skills/interests,"The tests in this book only measure aptitude, and do so poorly. It does not account for individual skills (such as organization, communication etc), artistic ability, interests, or motivations. The test results are broken into ""career clusters"". There is very little information provided for each cluster - a big disappointment after spending so much time on the tests."
2,A limited look at abilities and aptitudes.,"This system of testing is extremely limited if you are not interested in a business or exact science career. My wife and I did the tests on the same day. Whilst she scored Low to Low Average on every single test,I scored Very High to Very Superior on all of them. What's more after I had completed all 6 tests, I was already certain about her results before she even sat down to do them. Yet she is a highly successful physician and a talented artist/decorator. I am a fairly good computer programmer and mediocre businessman. This test needs serious revising - sections on memorising, creativity and spatial aptitudes, to name a few, need to be included."
2,okay for youngsters,"I did not find this book helpful. I think it is more appropriate for young people who have not been in workforce. Once you have been in the workforce for any length of time, the results will lean toward whatever field you are working in."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This has to be one of the worst books that I have ever used. I'm currently looking for another job and I thought this book would be great. Well after spending almost 3 hours doing the tests, which are difficult SAT type questions, the results were a joke. It recommened that one of my careers which would be an excellent fit is a Fish Hatchery Manager. Come on....Even if I wanted to do this how many jobs are available in the USA that match this. Just a small handfull I would guess. Another career path was Airport Reception Lounge worker. Give me some larger categories. I would not recommend this book at all. Waste of time and money."
5,Great!,"This book really helped me. For someone who was pretty lost, it is a very helpful resource to get to started in some sort of direction."
1,Misleading,"First, the tests suffer from knowledge bias. In order to do well on the Logical test, one must have a pretty extensive vocabulary. In order to do well on the Social test, one must have extensive knowledge of how to deal with people in a psychiatric, counseling, and education environment. Second, some of the suggested careers are really quite laughable. Hydroponics nursery manager? Airline lounge receptionist? Embalmer? I realize that these are in fact jobs/careers, but these types of careers make up a large fraction of the careers suggested, which means, I think, that the author has simply tried to fill up pages to make the system appear workable."
2,I wanted to Love It...,"But there just wasn't anything there. Even after reading Garth's intro, where he says that he is just writing ""entertainment"", nothing complex, even after that, I was still felt terribly let down. The story is extremely shallow, the characters less than paper caricatures. The whole series, it seems, was cranked out like shovel-media, in order to fill pages with minimal thought, and fastest market delivery.I hope that Garth realies that some of his fans need more than thoughtless, perdictable pulp, and puts his thinking cap back on."
1,Sad,"I am not a big fan of what Garth Ennis has done with the Punisher. For some reason I was expecting something gritty and rough, something to match Tim Bradstreet's covers, but what we got here instead are silly and ridiculous tales, about as thought-provocative as en episode of teletubbies. If you like childish stories, with a poorly drawn Punisher who kills people in lame and silly ways, by all means, pick this up..."
3,Delivers in blood-soaked spades,"Welcome Back, Frank is a nice return to form for The Punisher. Garth Ennis knows what fans of the original series are looking for and he delivers it in blood-soaked spades. Plenty of innovative killings, tons of smarmy remarks, and more attitude than Dirty Harry at his nastiest. Ennis is still warming up to the character in this book (he gets progressively better with each Punisher graphic novel), but he still packs plenty of bang for your buck with this first outing. As an added bonus, this is the book the movie was based on. If you liked the film, you'll LOVE this graphic novel!"
1,OK performance marred by bad recording.,The event is recorded in a open-air damaged building. Can you imagine the quality of (a) the camera angles and (b) accoustics. Avoid!
1,"Nice document, poor sound and picture quality","The main reason for switching from VHS to DVD is high quality (pure sound and image). Unfortunately in this case (and in most of the classic music editions) the sound and video quality is very poor. Even worse than in one normal audio CD. Anyway, the couple Mozart-Mehta is wonderful."
2,Very Disappointing.,"The only reason I gave it an extra star, is because Mozart still speaks to us with his haunting Requiem. The quality of the video and the music is horrendous--not to mention a good amount of war torn Sarajevo. If I wanted to see painful images, I would of tuned to one of those hunger drives on TV."
1,Poor Mozart!,"This Requiem version is such a painful experience to watch. I've never been so dissapointed with a performance of my favorite Requiem. Sound is bad, and not even Dolby Digital, video quality is VHS quality, plus camera work is awful, mistakes everywhere, bad design. When the camera is not in the orchestra, they put some footage from the Sarajevo war, very depressing and manipulative. The last straw was in ""Rex Tremendae"". The lyrics of this majestic movement are about the majesty of God and His glory. These ignorant producers put footage of a building in flames during this piece, a building in flames to describe the majesty of God?!?!? It looked like something satanic instead. I can't believe Zubin Mehta, who obviously had to be aware of this poor choice, and obviously has to know the meaning of the latin lyrics of the Requiem (I hope he does), allowed this to happen. It's a nightmare or a bad joke. Stay away from this version. It should never had been produced. It's an embarrassment."
1,Andreas H. Bitesnich's Nudes is Disappointment.,"This book is a major disappointment. The images are too dark, the style is overly contrived and the subjects are likely to please only those who are who like their women to look like men and vice versa. The only reason I rated it one star is because there is no lower rating."
2,"Technically excellent, but artistically disappointing","I was actually fairly disappointed by this book, though it does merit very high marks on the technical issues, i.e. the reproductions are of high quality, and the photographer knew his tools. It's just that I didn't care for the choice of images. Most of the images are very contrasty, moving quickly between almost oily highlights and deep shadows. The poses, while visually interesting, were very artificial and to me, unappealing. I guess the photographer was going for presenting the structure of the body and different kinds of lines you could generate with it. In that regard, he did a good job, but it was not a goal that appealed to me. And one final FYI, the book is black and white -- no value judgement on that, just information that I didn't see elsewhere on this page."
3,overall worthwhile but has some questionable content--,"This collection features many superb examples of the play of light and shadow on the human body. Most of the photos are indeed artistic & in good taste but a few fall short of the best taste in my opinion; a notable example of the latter is a quite explicit close-up of oral sex on one full page plate which falls more into the category of pornography than art in my view.Being an artist who considers the unclad human form the greatest aesthetic creation of God, I am not a prude but I buy books like this with that in mind. However I don't believe in throwing out the proverbial baby with the proverbial bathwater so I am keeping my copy of this book but I do give it a very qualified recommendation.You pays your money and you takes your chance (with the option of returning it to Amazon if it is totally unacceptable for whatever reason)."
3,Artistic but poor print quality,"The book could have been a major title in nude photography had it not been for the poor quality of prints: almost half of them are too dark, overcontrasted, with almost no discerning details seen. Now, the intention of the author was the black and white low key photography and there are some photographs that are simply excellent - very artistic with a wide spectrum of shades, showing the beauty of human body in exquisite detail, particularly in the first half of the book. But almost none of the images in the last third of the book are any good for the very reason of poor quality of print: close to black and white blobs.... Too bad. Hopefully another edition will be better, for Bitesnitch is worth paying close attention to."
5,Good,I liked alot of the readings we had to do for my English class and it's examples help guide us in class.
5,Good quality crate,"I am very happy with the quality of this metal folding crate I purchased over the summer. It is heavy, but sturdy, and the three doors give added flexibility in positioning the crate for use. I only use the crate for long road trips in our large SUV with the family of 5 and our 100 lbs Golden Retriever. This crate is very large, so check the size to make sure it will fit in your vehicle if that's where you plan to use it. It's nice to be able to fold it up for storage when it's not in use. The plastic tray had a small crack in the corner when it arrived, but it wasn't a big deal to me and we have used it several times without any further cracking. This is the best quality folding crates for the money that I could find. I would order it again without hesitation."
5,Everglades up close,This is a great addition to any animal science curriculum. The movie is very informative and at the same time enjoyable to watch. It is 30 minutes long which makes it very easy to fit into a class period as a special treat.
1,wrong product,"This will not connect your wii to the internet, you need a separate part that attaches to the wii. The wii is usb this cable is not usb at all, it is an rj45 on both ends."
3,Very small boat and trailer for the price!,We thought for sure this toy boat was bigger than what we had recieved. Our grandson has some smaller trucks that he can use the boat with - It is what it is.....
5,Vladimir Vasiliev,"I'm glad that the majority of the reviewers agree that Vladimir Vasiliev is the best dancer in the world -- because he is. Why do you think Baryshnikov, Nureyev and Godunov left Russia? Not because they were so good -- but because they had to contend with so many excellent dancers as Vasiliev, Liepa, Solovyev, etc. Too bad about Godunov, because he was up there with Vasiliev in terms of technique and performing abilities. (I guess he just didn't get along with Baryshnikov whom he had known since his childhood--they are both from Riga and studied in the same ballet school.) As a testimonial to Godunov's abilities just watch ""Anna Karenina"" ballet with him and Maya Plisetskaya. Back to Vasiliev, I wish there were more full tape ballets released with his performaces, i.e. ""Laurencia"", ""Giselle"", ""Stone Flower"". BTW, Balanchine left Russia because there were so many other talented choreographers. There's no way one can even start comparing him to Grigorovich."
2,a strange book,"King of Cats was recommended to me by a friend, along with another gay novel, a historical called Phoenix. Loved the historical, though I don't usually like them, but I didn't understand King Of Cats at all. It jumps around from year to year, the characters are nasty and unpleasant, the writing is pretentious. I believe the author has a lot of talent, but thinks he's some kind of intellectual. Maybe he is. Maybe I'm just too dumb to get it. I give him two stars for trying, anyway. There were also a lot of typos and grammar mistakes. Well, maybe his next book will be better and worth spending money on."
4,"Swingin' ""King of Cats""","Don't let the structure of this story, in ""five novellas,"" affect your judgment before you pick up this excellent book.The five interconnected stories center on Jimmy Lyons, an English rock guitarist. A la Tarentino, these stories are out of chronological order on purpose. The sequence ties the stories together with their organic emotional progression.Based on the idea that ""our secrets define us,"" this story of relationships and self-discovery starts with others peripheral to Jimmy. Subsequent sections reveal when Jimmy joins a band, the Bogs, is bedded by band leader Adam, then finds musical success with the group.The last section is the most disturbing and perhaps the most revealing, as it covers the rough terrain of Jimmy's childhood.The author, Blake Fraina, has crafted a tale of of what drives attraction and the back-and-forth of power in a relationship. It's a gem that deserves a larger audience, and I suspect the name Blake Fraina will loom much larger in the future."
4,Fraina: King of New Writers,"The brilliant first line of Blake Fraina's King of Cats grabs its readers by their genitalia and pulls. But the reader quickly realizes that the pain is mixed with pleasure; the line is also tickling his funny bone. It is an attention-grabbing hook and it is classic.That hook introduces its readers to Fraina's brilliant, intelligent, thought-provoking, entertaining, and stylish first novel. It is a book, the author would like people to believe, that evolved by accident. It began, he says, as a short story, then became five linked stories and ultimately a complete novel. But talent like Fraina's is no accident.King of Cats is about the lies people tell and the truths they never share. It is about fictional characters Sam, Elliott, Jimmy, and Adam. It is about what they choose to expose to the world, their veneers, and it is about what they hide deep inside at the core of their souls. But, more important, King of Cats is about you and me."
2,"Some interesting points, but below average overall","I am a admirer of both Ellis Spear and Joshua Chamberlain. They were brave men who served their country well in a time of crisis. After the war it appears that Spear and Chamberlain had a falling out. Neither Spear or Chamberlain are without faults, no one is. However, the author has attempted to make mountains out of mole hills.This book is not without merit, but does not measure up to John Pullen's work."
3,A Hero Under attack,This is an unfortunate account of a real American hero. Longacre seems to be doing his best to discount many other historical works on Chamberlain. His countless references to Ellis Spear as his authority tells the tale of this very flawed and critical work. Make no decisions on Joshua Chamberlain until you have read other author's accounts.
4,"Joshua L. Chamberlin: Forever a Hero, Finally a Man","I found this book on my favorite hero of the War Between the States, totally refreshing and very interesting. Opinions and conclusions presented by the author are well supported. These will be received well by those who wish to know more about this very complex and beloved human being. Less by those who seek only hero worship. An Excellent Read!"
3,The Facts as presented,"A thoery that the author of this book menchend in a 1999 Dec. issue of Civil War Times the author states a theory that Chamberlain didn't do the right weel forward at Little Roundtop on July 2,1863. In Mark Nesbitt book about Chamberlain a report Chamberlain wrote whice was written on July 6,1863 gives insterctions that if you take step by step clearly comes out to a right weel forward. Chamberlain made that charge but didn't want to defend himself in 1884. He didn't have to if you are awarded the Medal of Honor you shouldn't have to defend yourself. I think the author should get the facts staright."
3,Not a big as it should be.,"I have a 14.1 inch screen Dell and this fits ONLY if stretched. Poor execution if it should fit a 13-15"" laptop."
5,very sturdy,"The Built sleeve is perfect for my 13.3"" laptop, to prevent scratches and provide cushioning. The sleek curves on the sides make it easy to carry around.The only thing is that it doesn't have a pocket to store your charger, but this is the case with most sleeves since it's assuming you have a bag or backpack to carry it in."
4,"Great case, fit perfectly","Bought this for my boyfriend's 14.1 inch HP laptop and its great. Fits like it was made for it. Good quality product to protect the laptop while in a larger bag. Overall, happy so far with the product though he's only been using it for a couple weeks."
4,major Finnish rockers return!,"Jim Pembroke and guitarist Rekku Rechardt return in fine form. Top pop, Dylan-esque rock and '70s prog unite in style. Wigwam rule!"
1,"Beware: This is NOT a ""Ray Charles"" Collection!","This book is, mostly, a collection of the original sheet music of songs Ray Charles performed and recorded. In other words, they are the original versions, NOT the versions that Ray recorded. For example, ""Georgia On My Mind"" is the original Hoagie Carmichael version from 1930, NOT the ultra-smooth version Brother Ray so cooly laid down. Some of the sheets are useable, like ""Crying Time,"" and ""Born to Lose,"" but almost all are NOT the Ray Charles version. You have been warned!"
1,Not true to size,These boots do not run true to size. I wear size 8 1/2 so orded up to a 9 but my toes were crammed into the front of the boots...a lot of money wasted on shipping. I am dissappointed.
1,Los Diablos,"Obviamente este grupo es imitador hasta del nombre del que fue famoso y talentoso grupo español cuya voz principal era Tony Ronald. Entre los exitos de este grupo español de los sesentas y setentas destacan entre otras: Un Rayo de Sol, Lazos de Amistad, Acalorado,etc."
1,These are not the real Los Diablos,"The real Los Diablos are a 60's group from Spain. With hits like ""Un rayo de Sol."" Which were great hits all over Spain and Latin America."
3,Going solo,"If you're interested in Harold Litten's subject matter and books, this is the one to read. I feel it overcame some of the limitations of his first book, ""Joy of Solo Sex,"" which was criticized by some who strictly wanted a book of techniques.This book covers the topic in a more accessible way, but be aware that it really does seem to be targeted at gay men. Some straight men would be offended by it. It's not every day you see a book on this topic, and Harold Litten truly is the guru of male self-pleasure.I also liked this better than his ""fantasies"" book, which is not for the faint of heart (seems like some fantasies should stay in one's head and not be committed to print).Though ""More Joy"" is not erotica, many readers will find it hotly exciting--especially to read about a subject you don't see much about."
1,Primarily for gay men,This book does not only concern the enjoyment of solo male sex as it pertains to oneself but goes into great detail in the admiration of the physical attributes of other men. The publisher's description of the content is very misleading and borders on false advertising as they know it wouldn't sell well were the truth about its homosexual nature be known. I sifted through the few chapters that were of interest to me then tossed the book into the garbage.
4,You're not alone,"On a retreat with Restored To Serve, a ministry I'm involved in, we used this and two other books by Cecil Murphy to open dialogue between all of us. As we read page after page someone would say, ""I really need to read this whole book.""What we got was that the books let us know there were others going through the same things we were. Those who are caring for elderly people who have their ""moments"" were helped and we read and found comfort in the pages of When Someone You Love Has Alzheimer's."
4,Good nutritional guide -- not a cookbook,This book is basically a list of foods with the nutritional content important to renal patients. As such it is a good guide when preparing a meal. It should be noted that this IS NOT a cookbook. It has no recipes in it.
5,Excellent book!,My father is on a new renal diet. He just started going to dialysis three times a week. This book helped us cope with the sudden demands of a renal diet and really helped calm our fears. Cooking for a dialysis patient isn't nearly as complicated and daunting as we thought. Highly recommended!
5,Moving,What a moving and wonderful book. I found this book to be so insightful and educational. A must read for any concerned parent.
2,"Lots of ""Intro"" talk...prefer her excellent orginal CD Progressive Relaxation &....","I've been listening to Carol's first CD ""Progressive Relaxation & Autogenic Training"" (for sleep/relaxation) for years (consistently) & decided to try this one back in 2007. There was so much ""intro & instruction"" talk, I gave it away. I'm not sure why Carol made this one as it is similar but not as good as her first one....the Progressive Relaxation & Autogentic Training CD is superior."
2,good book... bad movie,"Well i read this book in college, and then saw the movie as my first date with the girl I'm gonna marry. This hardcoevr addition was perfect for hidding a ring."
4,THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK,"I HAVE READ ALOT OF ASTRONOMY BOOKS LATELY AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HOW MUCH I ENJOYED THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK COVERS ALOT FOR ASTRONMERS WHO CANNOT GET OUT OF THE CITY AND HAVE TO PUT UP ALOT WITH LOUSY SEEING CONDITIONS, THIS BOOK EXPLAINS HOW CERTAIN TELESCOPES WORK BETTER FOR SUBURBAN SITES VERSUS SCOPES FOR CITY FOLKS. THE BOOK ALSO GOES INTO DETAIL ABOUT HOW BY USING CERTAIN FILTERS WE CAN HOPE TO DO BETTER AT A CERTAIN SITE. A REALLY GOOD BOOK FOR THE AMATUER WHO WANTS TO GET THE MOST FROM HIS TELESCOPE."
1,Needs a good editing job---,"This is one of the poorest books I have read on the subject of amateur astronomy. In principal, the ideas behind this book are sound. I especially liked the instructions on how to build a 'barn door' mount for a camera. Unfortunately, these 2 pages were the exception to what should have been a much better book. There are quite a few editor's mistakes - including a picture of Orion that is printed backwards. I found some of the information helpful, but the errors and simple mistakes were so much of a distraction as to preclude my suggesting this book to anyone."
3,All About Paul,"The photos here are great, but the prose is so pro-Paul it's incredibly sickening. The writer's opinion just sticks out everywhere, making the reading very frustrating. Paul can do no wrong, and the other three can do no right. Harumph!"
3,Not really Darcy,"While I did enjoy parts of this book, it didn't measure up to Jane Austen's characterizations of Elizabeth and Darcy. The author has them doing things that seem contrary to who they are. So, if you must read more of E&D this will do, but it's not a satisfying continuation of their story."
1,jane austen turns mills & boone,"Pride & Prejudice is one of my favourite books and Marjorie Fasman's spin off is sheer mockery of this classical lovestory. It seemed to me that she hadn't even read the original but only seen the BBC drama series of it! What seemed to me most uncharacteristic of the two lovers was the fact that the last third of Mrs. Fasman's book Darcy can hardly wait to be married to Elizabeth to get her in the sack and then when they are married we find descriptions such as ""he took her there on the floor""...it just does not suit the subtle romance that is described so elegantly by Jane Austen and to me mocks the original."
2,Not What I would expect of Mr. Darcy...,"I would have to agree with the reviewer who stated that this was more of a continutation of the BBC miniseries than of the book itself. I would find it hard indeed that Mr. Darcy would write like an infatuated awkward teenager. I was quite disappointed with this book, especially after reading great reviews and hearing from co-workers about how good this was. While I found it better than Bar Sinister, I still found it lacking a great deal. To me the reason why Darcy is a romantic icon is because he's mysterious, confident, moral and intelligent. This book would have you believing that he had no self-confidence, lacking a keen intellect, and that he was unable to deal with his self realization of being in love. It's too bad Freud wasn't around just yet, because this Darcy could have spent much of his life on Freud's couch."
1,It's not Jane Austen- but it is OK,"Apart from the fact that it was obvious that the author had not even read the P&P it was quite entertaining although totally unbelievable. She got dates, times, names wrong had absolutely no idea how to capture Austen's style and wrote about subjects that Jane would not have even dreamt of alluding to. And it had American spelling throughout!!(YUK) It is quite sexy- so if anyone has ever fantantised about Lizzy and Darcy's sex life this is the book for you."
2,The Diary of Henry Fitzwilliam Darcy,"I was a bit disappointed with this sequel to ""Pride and Prejudice"". One should note that it is more of a sequel to the BBC movie (which I loved) than the Jane Austen book. The author force-fits some of the characters into a history that contradicts the novel. The concentration on the sexual side of the relationship disrupts the feel of the characters one has grown to know. The writing is fine and the Diary a quick read, but the substance of the writing will be disregarded in any of my musings about what happened to the wonderful characters of ""Pride and Prejudice."""
2,Just The Correct Facts Please!!,I rated this two stars because I thought the concept was interesting. I have to wonder however if this author ever viewed P&P. I can accept mispelled words and gramitical problems but not basic plot devations. Darcy's father dies first?? Darcy admit's to seeing Jane in London?? these are just the medium to big issues I had with the book. There were many such discripencies that made this sequel one I would not reccomend to anyone even with the very cute cover and concept.
2,Not Fitzwilliam Darcy,"HENRY Fitzwilliam Darcy. I don't understand the name change, for one. My real major complaint is that Darcy's tone from childhood into manhood scarcley changed at all. He sounds immature even when he writes about falling in love, his struggles, his rejected proposal and his path to acceptance. The disparity between Darcy's letter to Elizabeth and his diary entries is so distant. It's understandable that he was more formal in his letter, but again, the tone is not Darcy's.If you don't take it too seriously, you may find it funny and ridiculous. If this diary reveals the 'essentials' of Mr. Darcy, then Mrs. Elizabeth Darcy may not check herself. Like her father before her, she will find her spouse amusing and will laugh at him!"
5,"Wow, Wow, Wow! I loved this book!","I wanted it to go on and on forever. It is such a wonderful glimpse into what Darcy's life ""might"" have been like. I wanted to cry for him as a child. Then...the relationship between he and Elizabeth AFTER the marriage was incredible. What a delight! It is also a brilliant insight into the workings of the male mind. I think I even understand my husband a bit better after reading this.A must have for all Pride and Prejudice fans."
5,Longing for Dad - Review,"The author synthesized a lot of information & presented it very well in terms a layperson should easily understand. If you, or someone you know, has lost a parent and you're interested in finding out the effects, or just interested in the subject for whatever reasson (e.g. a psychology student...) this book will provide a lot of insight in a short, easily readable, space."
3,Good but left me hanging,Good but left me feeling like it didn't cover aenough about how to move forward after processing how it can affect your life
4,texas,"good product. works on new blemishes but if they are the larger inflammed ones it might take away some inflamation but not really help clear it as fast as the others. i'm sure it helps but it works better on newly forming ones. if you've tried the pro-active spot treatment, then to me it's very similar."
3,Not having good results,Not sure why this isn't working for me. It came VERY HIGHLY recommended by a friend. I hope it works for everyone else the way it works for her.
4,Works on the big painful ones too... Just don't over do it,I'm 31 and have had acne since I was 14. I have tried everything under the sun. I stear clear of benzoyl peroxide products like proactive as I have sensitive skin and ruined countless sheets towels and shirts. I tried this when I was searching for a sulfur mask (I was using DDFs) and thought that this product was better priced than the other similar surfer lotions at 3x the price. 24 hours later the deep painful pimples were smaller and didn't hurt. The next day the blackheads were gone. Third day I only had tiny whiteheads left. I got greedy and tried to get rid of those and woke up with dry skin. I over did it. Works great on almost all my pimples but the tiny ones were unphased. The clear liquid goes faster than the sediment but there are some good suggestions to consider in the other reviews worth trying.
2,Tiny Breakouts,"This product worked on one pimple on my chin, but then when I applied it to other pimples, it caused me to break out with tiny bumps all around the pimple I put it on! Like Heat Rash bumps...I figured it was bringing out toxins, but it continuedso I stop. Besides an occasional pimple here and there , my skin is in great condition, that's why I purchased it, for the overnight drying since I dont break out much... I really wanted it to work for me, the reviews were great...but it did'nt. : ("
3,Works okay,This product worked ok for me. I have Severe nodular acne on one side of my face and when I put the product on it did shrink the size of the pimple but nothing dramatic. when I would get a pimple on my neck area I will put the product on it at night and the next morning it will still be there. So it helped on my face but not on my neck.....weird! I think this product might work on people that get the occasional pimple.
3,I thought it would Zap zits.....,My daughter has been using it for about a month now and at first I thought I saw some clearing up but I don't see that anymore.....Not sure about this product :(
2,Did not work for me,"This may work for some people, but it did not work for me. I wanted to use it for the occasional large, resistant blemish. I followed the instructions carefully, but this product had no discernable effect."
4,It's a good product,"Over all a good product, smells kind of funny but does bring a pimple to surface rather quickly and helps heal faster. With that I guess that means it does it's job. I've already recommended to friends. I have isolated pimples here and there and this works great for that purpose."
3,Just a sulfur treatment. Works okay.,This works similar to the Proactiv sulfur mask for me. I dip a q-tip down in to the liquid and then cover my zit(s) with a pretty decent layer of it.Over a day or so it definitely shrinks them down a bit.
5,Nothing Works Better,This product works so well. Dab it on at night and blemishes of all sizes are reduced or eliminated by morning. I've had a friend tell me she thought it burned but I have very sensitive skin and have never had a problem. Where was By Bye Blemish when I was a teenager?
4,Bye Bye Blemish works well,Use as directed and it works really well. Reduces redness and shrinks pimples over night!
3,"OK, but Very Drying!!!","This product is essentially calamine lotion with sulfur added. They have also added tons of alcohol, which makes it dry out your skin further. For those of you that have found that Bye Bye Blemish dries out your skin too much, you can achieve better results using plain calamine lotion every night and applying a sulfur mask (such as the one by Acne Free or Proactiv) 2 or 3 nights per week. That way you won't have to deal with the excessive drying effects of too much sulfur and added alcohol. Overall, Bye Bye Blemish is a decent product, but it's not something to be applied to your whole face nor should it be used everyday if you have dry or combination skin. It seems that it might work well for someone with oily skin, but I can't say for sure."
5,works,"I have tried a number of products, including a few benzoyl peroxide based ones. None really worked. This product dries most of them in in a night. The only con is that my whole face gets dry too, even though I apply it on certain spots mostly on forehead."
5,This stuff Works,After trying every single product on the market...including ScriptsThis is the one product that kills acne in under a day. It dries the acne right out and doesn't over dry or irritate your skin. The first couple uses may be slightly irritating but once your skin adjust I no longer get the irritation. Apply lightly and watch the acne go away including redness. This product is a life saverand keep my flair ups under control !!!!!
5,Excellent Face Medicine,All the family uses the bye bye blemish and can't find it in stores anymore. Hence found a place on net that was best price and bought 4. Will be buying some more soon. Came with a free FM radio. That was awesome. Hope my next order is so cool too. Came quickly and just what I needed. Thank you so much. Hope I can remember exact place I ordered it from because need that to order more in the near future.Thanks
3,Worked like any other acne stuff I tried,"This was going great for me at first... But then after a few days, I noticed a NEW pimple on my face.. this was a pimple that isn't even in my T-zone, where I get the most of my pimples. Plus, this drying lotion cannot get rid of all your pimples. In fact, blemishes are still visible after using this. So I say, trying something else first."
1,what the...,"I tried this stuff after having great success with Mario Badescu and I regret the decision. Mario actually stops my acne literally overnight. The bye bye product seems to have the same ingredients but they must have different proportions. The bye bye product would dry to a flaky mess that would just fall off as soon as it dried. And I felt no tingling whatsoever. Not even after I applied it on a zit that had already popped. Try that with Mario and you feel the burn!!! After a few tries, I threw this knockoff in the garbage and placed an order for the real stuff; Mario Badescu."
1,ByeBye Blemish?,"I ordered By By Blemish a couple weeks ago after reading all the ""good"" reviews on it. I was breaking out really bad for some reason and was desperate to find something that worked. Bye Bye Blemish did absolutely nothing for my pimples. They didnt shrink nor did they disappear. The only good think i got from this product was it stopped my mosquito bites from itching."
2,Doesn't work!,"I bought this after seeing all the great reviews, I'm glad to see it work with everyone else I only wish I got the same results. I've been using this for 4 nights on the SAME pimple and it's STILL there. Waste of $8 bucks"
2,set up for the let down,i was hyped up for this for 2 years only to be let down in 5 hours. i dont like the fact that she didnt even give the REAL FATHER a chance. she did that to herself and sheldon smdh he had been an upstanding man in the other books what happen Ms. Alers?????? dont answer that
4,( ;D),"lOVED THE STORY but with Sheldon being 53 kinda wasn't my cup of tea because she was 35, me personally don't like when characters are so far off in age... but other than that LOVEDDDDDD IT GREAT STORY...."
5,Just what I needed!,"First, the book came earlier than stated (great!) then I couldn't put it down. Secondly, I read it through and through in one night! Would recommend this and all of Brenda Jackson books. Got my cousin reading them now. Great story line."
1,Not Happy,i was not happy with my purchase.it is nothing like the picture.the links were so small i had to get a magnifying glass to see them.and is very thin.. i am scared to were it.and i don't...very unhappy.
5,Wife loves her birthday present!,"Just the right with and length for her! The gift box was nice so I didn't have to wrap it again. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a true anklet, not a bracelet to fit your ankle."
2,Scares without balance,"Most of the book is devoted to all the things that the authors suggest are likely to go wrong, with all kinds of scary statistics about an increased risk of birth defects. The book mentions that even taking folic acid might not help a large mom prevent spina bifida in her baby. I don't think this is helpful, especially since nowhere do they point out that even if you face increased risks, the odds are still overwhelmingly in your favor that you will have a healthy baby. I would not recommend this book to anyone since all it seems to offer are reasons to be scared, and doesn't provide any better nutrition advice than you could get from any number of other, much less panic-inducing, pregnancy books."
1,Scared me to death - HORRIBLE book....,"This book was TERRIBLE! It scared me to death! It just made me feel like there was no way for a large woman to have a healthy baby and that I should be ashamed for even getting pregnant! Two MUCH better books would be ""Big, Beautiful, and Pregnant"" and ""Your Plus Size Pregnancy"" - they are more along the lines of what to expect - step by step information. If you feel nervous or wary of being plus size and pregnant - DO NOT get Carrying a Little Extra - its cruel."
1,Horrible Book,This book scared me to death and I was for sure I would have a miscarriage. Made me feel like I was not worthy of pregnancy b/c I was overweight! My husband threw this book in the trash and we are better for it!!!!!
1,If I could give it a zero,"This book is HORRID! I am overweight and had a great pregnancy. I did get pre-eclampsia in the 36th week, but that is because it runs in my family - not because of weight. I had a c-section because I had another medical issue NOT related to my weight. I gained 22 lbs and my son was perfect. THIS BOOKS STINKS!"
2,Not what it's name says,"This software product is like one of those little cheap things you buy just before a trip. Once you're 10 minutes (20 for this) into the trip, you'll wish you had spent the money on something else. Sure, it's got some OK ones, but the rest are cheesy and no fun. (...) I give it a 2 out of 5 because of about 10 good games out of the 200 that are just so sadistically horrible. (these might be for people like my dad, who just cant get into the groove of the new 3-D games. He's stuck on Donkey Kong 2.)"
5,Facing cancer,I highly recommend this book for anyone going through cancer treatment or a spouse of a person going through cancer treatment. It conveys strong hope and gives the reader the support to face the future. It helped to give me the strength to be more supportive of my wife as she went thought each day. The book helped me with the stress I felt so that I could be calm for my wife
2,low quality,"The clamp is made from flimsy plastic, and the clamp is riveted to the light so you can't change the position of how it clamps to the boat."
5,Excellent knives,"These are amazing steak knives and cut effortlessly, even my children use them effortlessly. They are very sharp and stay sharp and cut through the toughest cuts of meat easily. I sometimes use them for prep work on vegetables as well. Sturdy and well made."
2,Do not recommend,I was hoping for a narrative written by the actual driver and not some fiction writers ideas and thoughts of how the trip supposedly commenced.
5,hobble free!,my little toe pushes into the toe next to it which results in a painful corn the width of a dime. I work in retail which means i'm always on my feet running around in dress shoes. i finally broke down and bought these corn protectors and i love them! i don't hobble around wincing in pain anymore! the only con- is if your shoes are narrow or have a limited amount of space in the toe box- you will experience pressure on your other toes which may result in another painful corn!!!!i still gave it 5 stars though- it solved one problem for me! i'm going to buy some aetrex stretchables and see if those solve my problem of my pinkie toes pressing too hard on the sides of my shoes!
2,NOT WHAT I'D HOPED FOR.,"HAVE A VERY PAINFUL BIG TOE PROBLEM. AS I HAVE SMALL FEET I'D HOPED THIS MIGHT HELP. I CAN EASILY GET IT ON THE TOE BUT ONCE I START WALKING IT MOVES AROUND AND CURLS UNDER. NO RELIEF LIKE THAT! PITY, I HAD HIGH HOPES. PERHAPS ON OTHER FEET AND OTHER TOES IT WILL BE FINE."
1,not worth it,It was not worth the money. It did not stay on toe rolled off after about 5 min of walking!
1,Not recommended,The protective gel is only on half the surface. The protector turns as you walk; twisting the protective gel surface away from the area needing the protective gel and sliding off the toe entirely. It doesn't do what the previous full gelled ones do and I recommend you look elsewhere.
2,Too pricy for what you get,"You get two small corn protectors. (The picture could be a bit misleading since they show 3 - but the product description does say there are only 2 per package.). These are very small and not very long. They fit my short, smaller toes ok, but they would never fit my husband's longer toes. As shown in the picture (the piece to the left) there is a small patch of gel attached to only one side. The problem with this is two-fold:1) you do not get protection around the entire toe;2) because the side without the gel has nothing to support it, it tends to roll down into a tight band, much like a thick rubber band. This causes some pain where none existed so I generally have to stop walking and find a bench to rotate the protector.My other objection is these only last a for a few uses. After shipping they ran $7+ which is way too expensive for such a disposable item - one that really doesn't work all that great either."
2,"Disappointing, sorry to say.","The problem for a beginner like me, trying to learn ""Alice's Restaurant,"" is that Gilewitz goes too fast with his instruction. He talks fast and shows all to quickly the chords, and which strings to strike. I got lost right away. I prefer Mike Herbert who has instruction in ""Alice's Restaurant"" and other pieces. Instruction done slowly for the beginner, with tablature provided. Richard Gilewitz isn't a good teacher for the beginner, I'm sorry to say."
4,"Highly usable, homework done for you","This is a pastor/teacher/student's dreambook. Rare is the commentary that pulls you on to read further after you have finished your reference. This one does. Guzik avoids jargon and deals with translation problems only in controversial moments or to avoid misunderstanding. As you read, you discover that he has done the homework for you that you normally spend hours gathering and researching. Guzik includes analysis of some modern scientific theories and handles them well. I hope he lives long enough to finish the series and I live long enough to read them."
5,Daniel Green Dormie Slippers,Bought the slippers for my Mother-in-Law. She has used them for years like shoes because of sore feet. She is very pleased as usual.
3,Good but variable,All aspects of getting and using four of these in three colors were great accept that the quality varied.Three pair are perfect and wear well but one fell apart. It was re-glued and has performed well since then.
3,Fit,Doesn't fit as well as the last time I purchased this slipper. Perhaps there is a similar model altho these look the same as the last ones I purchased.
5,"Daniel Green Women's Dormie Slipper, Blaack, 8.5M","My mother likes this slipper very much. It gives her support and she won't break her neck. I will always wear this slipper, says mom."
1,Poorly made,"These slippers are a HUGE RIP-OFF.I purchased a pair of these slippers for my mother's Xmas gift this year and was so disappointed when she told me the pair I bought her last year fell apart in just a couple months. Her past experience with Daniel Green slippers had been so positive---they used to last for years---but they have begun making them overseas and the craftsmanship is now extremely poor. She said after the previous pair fell apart, she sent the shoes back to the company along with a letter expressing her disappointment and received no response. So as it turns out, not only is the quality of their product poor, their customer service is as well."
2,Meh..,"To be fair, there's nothing really wrong with these slippers. However, I found the quality somewhat subpar. Looks and feels like any cheap pair you can get in Chinatown. For the price, I expected a little better. Looks better in the picture than in reality - very plain, and something that your grandma would wear. Definitely not for a younger person unless you like the frumpy look. My last annoyance was the comfort factor. Now, I'm the type of person who can overlook A LOT as long as it's comfortable. This is not all that comfy as the reviews lead one to believe. The foot bed is hard and inflexible. It also makes loud noises when worn on hard floors, so wearing it around the house can be annoying for others. So, all in all, I'm going to trash these at the earliest opportunity and get something else."
4,comfort,"Very comfortable, worth every penny! A must have item for woman with tired feet. Slide into comfort after working all day."
5,Favorite slippers,These are my mother's favorite slippers. They hold up well with daily use. She likes the support they give her as opposed to soft soled slippers. She is a satisfied repeat buyer.
3,Danel Green Dormie Slipper,"Pretty well made slipper, however, it runs wide. I always take Medium but it's much too loose. Next time I'll get Narrow as it stretches."
2,Too wide,These slippers were too wide for my feet. I returned them (postaged-free) and ordered a different slipper which fits quite well. Shoes.com was very helpful. I appreciate this company very much.
5,great gift for mom,"My mother loves this brand of shoes. I buy her a pair of these every year at Christmas. They have an excellent selection of sizes and colors, and even have wide width."
1,not satisfied,"This item was not sized correctly. I have worn Daniel Gren dormie slippers for many years....a 9N..was good....I have many old pair inmy closet that are worn out and they are all 9N. Perhaps the fault liesin who is making these slippers now...CHINA!...I was very disappointed tosay the least. I ordered a pair from Old Pueblo and the sizing was better, but not the best....again they were made in CHINA!I also need to cancel I singed up when I ordered these slippers in orderto get free shipping....I will not need this program....Can you cancelfor me. Thanks,Mary Fairrington"
3,"A Difficult, Yet Rewarding, Analysis of Machiavelli's Works","Mansfield has written the perfect reference book for upcoming term papers on Machiavelli. His analysis of Machiavelli's writings is insightful and innovative. However, the book is written is a very formal style that makes it difficult to appreciate the interpretation that Mansfield puts forth. This is definitely not a book that one takes to the beach for some casual reading. That is a shame, because Mansfield's conclusions have practical implications for the modern politician or executive. Unfortunately, the dense style makes this book attractive only to academics"
3,"Good history, but no color pictures","This is a good book if what you're looking for is the history and description of Islamic tile styles. I was, however, disappointed that all the illustrations/pictures were in black and white. Bummer. The best part of Islamic tiles, as far as I'm concerned, is the use of color! I was hoping for lots of color pictures of Islamic mosques, etc. Nope. Anyway, I guess it's good as an art history book."
4,Very good beginner disc,"Excellent for anyone who is a true beginner playing the drum set. The videos go from unpacking the boxes, to tuning, to playing."
4,Loose Adaption,"Although the case may say its Kurosawa's version of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth', it is a very loose adaption. 'Throne of Blood' was more or less inspiried by 'Macbeth', but the story is very different. I'm willing to bet the same is true for 'Ran', which is an adaption of 'King Lear'(which I have not read). Nonetheless, the story is pure Kurosawa as dividing clans fight for territorial disputes and castles. A female character here is very similar to Lady Macbeth and many scenes do come right out of the play. She pushes her husband to do evil thing before the evil is done to him. If one is expecting to find Shakespere here, do not rent or buy it. The film does not have the unbelievably awesome monologue given by Macbeth at the end of the play. But if one is wanting to find a gem from Kurosawa's early years, this is bound to satisfy. As always in all of his movies, at least one unforgettable sequence exists. In this one, it comes at the end. You will know it when you see it."
5,Lean and Mean!,"An electrifing performance by Toshiro Mifune dominates this superb film!!! This is Kurosawa at his best. Spartan sets, crisp dialogue and extremely unsympathetic characters make this movie a tour do force of extremism! Of all Kurosawa's film this is the most surreal. There is nothing warm or smooth in this film. It is all right angles and cold calculation. The entire cast is magnificent. The sets are oppressive yet beautiful. The fog is like an approaching army. All of these elements together make for one of the best films I have ever seen. Mifune's death scene is not to be believed. Incredible!!!"
4,Samurai Macbeth,"I am a student of NIS(nagoya international school), and I saw the 'throne of blood' during my English liturature class. I afraid that I 'm not either japanese nor american, so I thought I would not understand clearly, but since I read Macbeth, and saw some of movies Shakespeare's verson which means I know basic story of Macbeth, and fortunely there was a caption in English, so it was easy to understand. Also I afraid the languages of Shakespeare's, becuase I didn't sure that Japanese can use the magnitude languages which is used by shakespeare. As I respect, the language was not rich as much as shakespear's, but director shows some scenes of interest scenes to cover the language that couldn't translate everything of shakespeare's language. Also it was pretty interest to see the Macbeth of samurai verson. I would strongly recommend this movie for student who wants to know Macbeth's interest."
4,video review,"In the English class I take, I read the original Macbeth which was written by Shakespeare. We watched several different versions of the play in this class. One of them was this version ""Throne of Blood"". Before watching this, I wondered how the director was going to express the rich Shakespearean language which is the main thing that makes his plays so fascinating in a totally different language, Japanese. As I watched this video, I felt that the director was very successful in expressing the themes and motifs that were used in the original version. The director had changed a lot of the sceneries and the plots, but the story seemed to flow very well and I believe that these changes were the keys to success in expressing and keeping the rich Shakespearean language.I would strongly recommend this movie to people that have read the original Macbeth. It is very worthwhile to take time to watch this version. It may be even better if you are able to understand Japanese."
4,Jap Macbeth,"I saw this movie ""Throne of blood"" during the class and I really enjoyed it. I think Akira Kurosawa was able to show the main point of Macbeth by using Japanese style movie. Still, there was some part where it was little different from actual Shakespear's Macbeth, such as, the ending, or the climax. Washizu was killed by his own men. I think this ending showed Kurosawas uniqueness in significant way."
2,"Great Looking, but Witless Version of Macbeth","I love Kurosawa, but this stripped down version of Macbeth is no Ran, his tribute to King Lear, which even my 11 year old loved. The dialogue is tedious, the wife is boring and not the catalyst she should be psychologically, and all but disappears once she takes matters into her own hands-- until the out damned spot scene. Too many scenes of riders approaching the castle in real time, etc. Some great scenes, but lo-oo-nnngg dry stretches in between. And where is the stand in for McDuff? That's the dramatic tension along with the wife. Both are inexplicably blown, here."
2,Kurosawa...well,"Strangely, most of the movies by Kurosawa just didn't click with me. Only exception is Yojimbo. I was disappointed with Seven Samurai too. I like his style of exploring chracters and conflict but Throne of blood was just OK.As a movie lover, I prefer B/W. Often I think B/W is more expressive but in case of Kurosawa, it just make movie dated. Not well balanced. Also, I feel his directing is kind of clumsy, pace-wise. Please do not throw a stone to me.Also, I didn't like Mifune's acting too. From the beginning to the end, only one expression on his face. Widely opened eyes. last scene was the only scene I enjoyed. How could they do that? Check Yojimbo. Mifune is cool, too!And is there any real battle scene really? I haven't seen one..."
1,Somethings are missing.,I will rather watch the original version of Macbeth than this film. Washizu is such a bad actor and I could do better than him. Only if I could speak Japanese.
4,William Kurosawa,"I was interested in the film ""Throne of Blood"" because it was directed by Kurosawa, the film making Legend of Japan. I've seen some of Kurosawa's work and I wanted to know how he would screen Macbeth in Japanese style. It was a good thing that Kurosawa didn't change the story line too much. As always, his screen shots were very stylish. I liked the climax, how Washizu was killed by his own men. It added more tragedy in to it."
3,Review is of BoYing edition,"I purchased ""Throne of Blood"" from one of the other listed sellers. It is clearly an asian version (though it plays on U.S. systems), it says ""BoYing"" on a corner, . The print quality is just O.K. but the sub-titles and other english translations are not the usual bad but are atrocious. I don't know if the Criterion Edition is better, perhaps someone who reads this review and has a Criterion Edition can comment. If it is better, spend the extra money and do not get the BoYing version. This is acceptable only if nothing better is available."
4,Throne of blood &#65533; Macbeth or not Macbeth?,"This was a very interesting way of representing Shakespeare's Macbeth.Before I saw it I was skeptical that Shakespeare in any other language than English would be lacking.I think that Kurosawa makes up for the lack of rich Shakespearean language with all kinds of interesting cinematic touches, such as the eerie white makeup he uses for the witch(es) and ghost(s). I also liked the camera angles used, even though many of the cuts were held too long.Even though the overall plot was similar to Shakespeare's Macbeth there were one or two things that I feel made it a completely different story. Macbeth's motivation to kill the king was very different in Kurosawa's version. I think the fact that Washizu (Macbeth) tells his army about the witch(es) radically changes the overall ending."
5,Could be huge !,"I saw her video on CMT and immediatly wondered why I had never seen her on MTV. She has a real good voice and the song is country flavored pop, rather than country. She appears to have more natural talent than some of the other teen girl pop singers. This song would really go over well with the MTV pop crowd and her record company would do well to try and promote her to that audience, they could have a real winner."
5,GREAT SONG!,"I loved this song. I just saw the video on GAC and it was great. I want this single really really bad for Christmas. She is, like everybody else has said, the Britney Spears of country. (Although in my opinion it isn't really country.)"
2,Predictable?,"I have not seen the movie which this featurette is about, so maybe I am at a disadvantage in reviewing the featurette, as well, but I practically knew everything the actors were going to say before they said it. The cheerleading camp was harder than the football camp, doubles were used for this and that, etc. I kind of like to be told something I was not expecting in these featurette/interviews, and that just was not the case with this one. Nor did it make me particularly want to see the movie, so it may not be serving its intended purpose in that regard, either."
1,just rubish,I do not know whats this it.It is 16 yeras old crap.They sell it as a new one.So everybody do not buy these dvds I bought them and I was lied to.we I asked some questions to them they never answered. So I am warning you it is old and obsolote do not trust them.All teh dvds witht thes offer are old and rubish
3,From the back cover,"Who - or what - is ""OMHA""?For over a thousand years the alien Gaddyl have ruled Earth, reducing men like Murno to bare existence and a Stone-Age technology. Now the Gaddyl have changed their tactics, and men are to be hunted and slain like animals.The only hope for man is the mysterious slogan, ""Omha Abides!"" If Omha, the long-promised savior, exists, then Murno must find and awaken him ... or it. Pursued by the Gaddyl and their savage mutant hunters, Murno must make his perilous cross-continental journey on foot in search of a legend.And if he fails, mankind dies...."
3,Very Strange Poet,"This book is a comprehensive work about James Whitcomb Riley. Anyone wishing to research this poet would use this book thoroughly. It is a fairly large volume with a lot of detail. It delves into the ways in which Riley used his real life to put forth his poetry, and I regard it as kind of dark, especially the Flying Islands of the Night."
5,Replacement Rotor Fixed the Filter Pump -- Great Buy,"My Millenium 3000 Aquarium Filter had stopped working -- it was rattling and did not pump water, even after I had tried to reprime the pump by pouring more water into the filter reservoir. I took the filter apart and found that the old rotor impeller for the pump had come apart in the middle (between the red [mine was green] and black shaft pieces, so it would not turn the impeller portion to move/pump the water through the filter. I searched and found this identical replacement piece (the photo shows a red impeller, mine old one was green and the replacement piece that arrived was also green). The price here was the best, so I ordered this one. It arrived very soon -- I put the new piece into the Millenium 3000 Filter and the filter now works perfectly again. I highly recommend this replacement part and this seller -- high quality, good price, reasonable shipping fee, arrived fast, fixed the problem."
4,Nice watch but big and heavy,"This watch certainly looks good and appears to be well made. I bought a watch repair kit on Ebay for about $15 to remove the extra links, and that worked fine. I doubt it could be done with ordinary small screwdrivers.While I am happy with the watch, especially for the price, prospective buyers should know that it is pretty big (the case is over 1.5"" in diameter) and it is heavy. Whenever I switch watches to this one, my arm definitely feels the difference for a short period of time before getting used to it.As I said before, overall I am happy with the purchase."
1,This is a worthless product,"I bought this product recently but unfortunately was a worthless since only worked for no more than 20 days. This is not a true apple product, it is falsified. Please don't buy this product because this is a waste of money, this is the worst product that I had bought in amazon !!"
3,The price is exactly what you get.,"I originally lost my original Apple earphones somewhere. I bought these in the hope that they were legit earphones. There isn't any bass and I had to push some of the parts into place near the earpiece. If you need cheap earphones, these are your best bet. You get you pay for."
1,worst thing ive bought on amazon,this was the worst thing i have ever bought on amazon. they dont send you the actuall apple hadphones they advertise they give you a cheapass knockoff of a different model of apple headphones. they also broke without warning in two days. i just pulled my ipod out and they didnt work so go ahead and waste two bucks. you would be better off gettting headphones from the dollar store
3,Could be better,"This product is just ""ok"". Construction is very cheap and tends to pull apart very easy. I would not buy this product again."
1,Don't own but....,I can't imagine why anyone would buy headphones that even look like the ones that come with an iPod. The iPod ones SUCK. Probably the crappiest headphones I've ever used... I'm just saying...
3,Earbuds,They work fine and they are cheap. Look just like the Apple headphone. They are not the same quality however. They break much quicker. Great for kids who always break their headphones.
1,Ear buds,These are not worth the money no matter how cheap they are. The sound quality is terrible. I got 4 pair of these one set only one ear worked. Another set the sound was weak. All 4 of them had AM like sound.
2,Stereo headbud earphones,"Purchased these earphones and received them rather timely. I used them for my mp3 player and they sounded really good. However, they stopped working after a month. I would not buy them again!"
1,Why NOT to buy!,So I just got this item in the mail today and I put them in my first thought is well they are very uncomfortable but oh well I don't care as long as I can listen to my ipod. So I turn the music on but only ONE earbud works so I try them on my computer but they don't work! Don't order this product it isn't even the one in the picture. when you hold them you can just tell they are cheap and not well made. The reason I bought new earbuds was because on my other earbuds only one worked! I was so angry I broke them I ripped them apart!
1,white earphones,"I bought these headphones and it took over a week to get to my house, on top of that i tried them and THEY DIDN'T EVEN WORK!!!! They were broken and i had to throw them out"
1,earbud,"i am not happy with my ear buds so far its ripping , i can hear through them very well , but I'm not happy at how they look."
1,Was not the quality I expected.,The headphones looked exactly like iPod headphones however they rattled when shaken and they had the quality of aan AM radio. Contacted Seller first day with no response. They were obviously not concerned with my satisfaction.
2,They do what they have to for a little while,I mean you get what you expect for what you are paying - the thing is they don't last much and I would recommend going for a higher quality product if you want something that doesn't give you too much trouble... or just get a bunch of these...
1,Bad Quality,"The quality of the product is very poor. You can actually feel it. They are BIG, that means they hurt your ears. The day i received them, i was excited because i wanted to use them already, but when i touched them i was disappointed... also, just one earphone worked. I highly recommend not to buy this product."
1,Ear bud,"I brought this product August 8th and it stop working on September 7th so I'm back not having earbuds for my Ipod, I wouldn't suggest purchaseing this product."
1,disapoined,"I bought this for my daughter to go on vacation,it was defective,lots of static,now I have to buy her a new one because I had to literally hold on to it for it to work,we'll be going on vacation it four days so theres no time to return,the product,I guess I got what I paid for :("
1,"Hands down, the worst thing Ive bought off the internet","They not only fell apart after 3 days, but the metal part on the inside of the bud which is supposed to protect your eardrum, actually came off and cut the inside of my ear! I should really sue, Amazon you should be ashamed of yourselves letting shady dealers such as BrilliantStore sell on your site.Only buy if you want to flush your $6 down the toilet, or you could just give it to me, either way you arent going to be happy you bought this completely useless product. I tried to give this no stars but it wont let me."
1,Misleading,"The item that is given to you is not at all what the picture is. You expect the quality iPod earphones, but what you get are cheap imitations. For $5, it's definitely worth it, but with the shipping, it costs nearly $10. I never used the earphones because they were terrible and fell apart the next day. I never bothered returning them because they aren't worth my time.If you want cheap, temporary earphones, I don't even suggest this. There are much better earphones that cost about the same for a better quality."
2,I don't like it...,"well, for earphones at $0.01 + $4.99 shipping fee, these earphones are useable, but only useable. When i opened the package, the first word popped out of my head was ""plastic"", yea, plastic. And the earbuds are a size bigger than the REAL ipod earphones. So when I put them on, it's not very comfortable. I haven't been wearing them for a long time, but i predict that my ears will hurt after wearing them for a while.my suggestion is that if you are just looking for cheap + not too good quality earphones, these are good for you. Otherwise, don't get it, you will be very disappointed..."
1,NOT EVEN THE SAME HEADPHONES,when you buy these headphones they are not the same in the picture the ones the give you suck.
1,Did not last more than a week.,"It stop working in a week time. Since the cost was very low-$1.98, I did not bother to report to the company. While it was working, I found it to be useful."
1,CRAP,"THE SELLER OF THIS ITEM IS FULL OF COMPLETE BULLSH8T...IBOUGHT THE EARPHONES HE WAS SELLING, AND THE EAR PIECE BROKE ON ME JUST MINUTES AFTER OPENING THE PACKAGE...DONT BUY FROM IMPORTER..HE'S COMPLETE CRAPPPY SELLER AND HAS CRAPPY SH8T TO SELL.."
1,Don't Buy These,"My wife bought two pairs of these for my two teen-aged kids to use with their iPods. One of the two arrived inoperable. The second one worked for about a week and then died. The first inoperable pair was replaced with another pair, which also died after less than two weeks. Do *not* buy these. They are a waste of money. I will say I had no problem returning them and getting the replacements. But what was the point. Spend a few extra dollars and get something that will work."
1,Do NOT buy,"After plugging them in I thought okay these are exceptable for the price, but then after about 3 minutes (one song) the right ear bud stopped working. I bought two so I thought maybe it was just this one, Let me use the other, and the same thing happened! These are a peice of junk. Avoid buying them at all costs, even though the price is so cheap, you will end up buying a different pair within moments of receiving these."
1,Not Satisfied,"I know these are cheap headphones, so i ordered 4 sets. 2 out of the 4 sets of headphones only worked in one headphone. What a rip off. I ordered these once before and the new headphones I got on this order are not the same as the ones I got before. I will never order these again."
1,not what I expected from a previous purchase,"I guess I got what I payed for, but the items I bought were of a poorer quality than others I purchased before"
1,not worth 2 dollars,These are not real ipod earphones. The sound quality is just horrible. Not worth $2. I will never use them. Waste of money and time.
1,Do Not Buy,first off they are not the Apple headphones.. they are just regular cheap headphones that are white. I got 4 pair. After 1 day the first ones left ear side stopped working. So I threw them away and used the 2nd pair. After 3 days same thing. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY COST. I was only expecting them to last for about 2 or 3 months since they was only $2. but 1 day? thats just sad. The seller should be ashamed for even selling them.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought these back in October of 2010. It's now January and I've used them about 4 times. I bought them with intentions of using them when I'm sitting on the couch streaming movies on Netflix. Like I said I've used them 4 times and the right speaker is broken. I know these were super cheap, but I really thought the build quality would stand up to sitting on a shelf 98% of the time. I was wrong. I would not recommend these, spend a few more bucks and get some that will last."
1,terrible.,These headphone are junk. I used them once and they snapped in half. I do not recommend this terrible quality.
1,Bad quality. Do not buy,The quality of the earphones is awful. It is literally painful to listen to anything in it. I had to throw them away because using them for even a minute causes a headache.
1,Stereo Earbud Headphone for Apple iPod nano/ iPod ...,"It's the worst earphones that I have, I bought three of them for my kids and one of them was not working when I received the same day , the others didn't work anymore in less than 1 week to received. Its a waste moneyStereo Earbud Headphone for Apple iPod nano/ iPod mini/ iPod video/ iPod shuffle"
1,Poor Quality,"This item lasted about a week before the screen over one earbud fell off. A couple weeks after that, most of the paint marking the left and right earbuds had already flaked off. These are what you pay for - cheap headphones, cheap quality. Steer clear."
2,Not your Apple ear buds,"Bought them, wore them, they fell apart. Unless my ears have some kind of special nasty wax that makes glue melt, these buds were worth the price I paid for them..."
1,Wish I never purchased,"Cheap, purchased 2 pair(s) for Christmas, they both broken, ear piece broke, wire on the other pulled away from plug"
5,Excellent,This product is amazing and great sound quality. I have had no problems at all. This is alos a great seller by the way. I was skeptical about ordering from other sellers besides amazon.com but this seller turned out to absolutely fine. I received my product on the exact date as expected and I was charged the exact amount as promised. Great prodyct and seller!
2,Ok for the price,"I bought these headphones for .60 cents, and when I got them, they were cutting in and out. I believe it was caused by a bent end. I dont know if I would buy again."
4,Good quality,An Excelent choice. Very good quality at accesible price. Perfect for replace your broken headphones or to have a pair of spare ones. I am very satisfied and I recommend it.
3,head phone,This headphone is not to the best and the sound quality is poor and low. I bought it a couple of weeks and it start shaking.
1,Generic,"Not iPod headphones, only look-alikes. Cheap, light, low quality, and break very easily as well as an easy shortage. Don't recommend."
1,BROKE IN 2 DAYS,this thing suck do not buy this thing will break in 2 days i rather spend 50 dollars then to by this thing
2,Not good quality,The quality was not what I expected and the sound quality is not that goodI bought them for my computer and they just don't sound good.
1,Earbud headphones,The first time i used them they can apart. So i went to the best buy store and purchase another pair.
2,Ok,They sound like all other stereo buds 2nd gen apple earbuds have a better fit and ear pods better than that can't even compare to my beats
2,ipod headphones,"Purchased two pairs of ipod earbuds,the first pair only one of the earbuds worked, the second pair fell apart."
2,Worked Great for a Little while,These had great sound for about a week or so and then all of a sudden the sound died.... but I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Uncomfortable and low sound quality,"Extremely uncomfortable for smaller ears; I cannot wear these for more than a few minutes. I am a full-grown adult female, so likely others will have the same problem. Also, likely because of the size, they fall out of the ear easily.The sound quality is not good, not the worst I heard, but pretty close."
2,ok!,"this item was, hate to say it, waste of my money...i am sorry but i wish i hadnt made this purchase because it stopped working in like a week!!! n i was taking great care of it! it was just very weak!"
1,Don't bother with this item,"I bought this item and it arrived quickly however, the left earphone went out the SECOND time I used them. I could tell they were cheap as soon as I took them out of the bag (not Apple ones as I thought) but I thought they would at least last a few months... Very disappointing."
1,Earbud headphone that does not work,"I purchased this item on September 19,2008 and received my order approximately four days later. The earbuds worked very well until yesterday (October 29, 2008) when the left earbud stopped working completely. I would advise against purchasing this product."
1,Never again!!!!!!!!!!,"Just because its an awesome price, save your money and buy real headphones that work!"
2,Ummmm...,"I really like the style of these earbuds, but.... one side is louder than the other. I am not trying to go deaf in one ear, major disappointment. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,Do Not Buy From GadgetDweeb!,"Earbuds were NOT Apple products as shown, but cheap knockoffs. This seller is purposely deceitful. Do not buy from them."
1,SUCKED,"These earbuds barely lasted me a week, and I guess that's to be expected of something so cheap. Do yourself a favor and don't buy these."
1,onelia acosta,"No puedo calificar porque el producto nunca llego a mi direccion en miami, y la compra fue cancelada en vista de que en dos oportunidades se hizo la solicitud y nada nunca llego"
2,faulty ear buds,THe ones I got don't work well... the right one goes in and out depending on movements which is annoying. THeres a band on the cord which the wires come out from very easy.
1,Cheap Chinese knock-offs of ipod ear buds,"The photo of the item is inaccurate.I wanted to give this seller the benefit of the doubt, but these ear buds are horrible.The grey part of the ear buds is shoddily attached and nothing like the original ear buds. The frequency response isn't as broad as the original ear buds--they sound worse."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Basically i just needed a pair of headphones that worked. i didnt need the traditional ones that come with the microphone for hands free use. When i received these headphones, the left one did not work AT ALL. And the right one was really ""static-e"". I was lured in by the price, but complete waste of money"
3,Weird Thing,This headphone do work but it do say name of the song it werid voice.It has a long cord too it is 13 in
3,ehhhh,"The length of the cord is kind of short so it makes it a little more difficult to use them in the gym. Also, the sound quality emanating from the headphones isn't great; however, that was kind of expected from $2 headphones."
1,crap,"at first i was siked, but they broke after the 3 use. a little tug and the cord separated from the earphones!"
2,Not the Apple Headphones.,"Similar looking, but not the actual Apple brand. Though in retrospect, it never claimed to be."
2,Cheaply painful,"I purchased these because they were replacement headphones to the apple ones I had origianally. The prior headphones where amazing, and I thought these were the same ones. Boy, was I wrong. Although they arrived in less than three days, they are made very cheaply and they are physically painful to put into my ears. I guess I should have known that seeing as the price was so low. I really wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless they just don't care if their ears hurt like hell. Maybe you could get them for someone you generally don't like? Who knows. These are just cheapo headphones."
1,I rated this because it was required but is a bad product.,"These headphones are a mess, i ordered them after my iPod, and kept them stored and when my iPod headphones broke, i used these and only worked for a week , i don't recommend this product at all!"
1,Waste of Money,The headphones I received were not the ones I was expecting. The quality is really poor and after a week I only get sound on the right side. I recommend that you buy this product only if you like wasting your money.
1,Useless earphones,"I ordered these as a backup pair of headphones. After trying them on for about an hour only one side worked. About 40 minutes after the sound lagged and the I could hardly hear music... O well, really cheap anyways. Still a waste of 3 dollars, save your money and go buy a pizza."
3,the length of the cable is way too short,"okay sound, really short cable, cool cable expander which keeps the cable from tangling, it's definitely not the picture shown, if you plan on playing sports with these headphones just forget it because the cable is so short that it wont even reach your pocket."
1,Tastes bitter & doesn't work,"This product took about a week to arrive which is fairly slow, but it was well packaged.The herbs don't seem to really work for my hyperthyroid condition, which is a shame, because the bottle is pretty expensive.The tincture smells quite strong & tastes very bitter.I wouldn't recommend it; I'm going to stick with taking ThyroSoothe, which is more expensive but it actually works for my symptoms."
5,Seller was great,"Fast shipping, Item was packed well and the price was lower than in stores. The supplement itself apparently works, I dont take it myself but my girlfriend likes it and seems to think it is beneficial."
3,Knowing What You are Receiving,"This book is a rather excellent book for its price; imagesare clear and informative. I purchased this book on a recommendation from my Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy instructor (college level).He said it was the best book he had seen at such a low cost. And, I agree to that point and in the value of the text.However, be aware that this book comes LOOSELEAF and THREE-HOLE PUNCHED. It is not a meer paperback bound book; it is NOT BOUND AT ALL. You must place it in a binder to keep it together. Would have preferred a bound text, but the publisher only offer's those to college instructors."
3,But the Responsibility...!,"I must say, I was really turned off by the constant underlying theme of, ""Yeah, my actions were bad, but it's everyone else's fault."" Parents? Hey, many of us had it way worse at home. Had to work in college? Many of us had to pay for everything! And then giving such short shrift to having sex repeatedly after knowing he was HIV positive? Where's the bitter remourse for all those he likely infected? It's great that Bob repented, but the real story here isn't about him at all. It's about the forgiveness he received from other in spite of all. Hey, Bob, take yourself down off that pedestal."
5,Heaven's Back Row,"This book is about a journey of Hope.....Hope in the midst of a devestating illness called AIDS. Hope in the midst of a confession to a homosexual relationship while simultaneously being married to your high school sweetheart. Hope in God when the rest of the world is spinning around you and your painful choices. It is difficult to put down, and as each page unfolds, you feel the HOPE starting to penetrate your heart. Heaven's Back Row is about real lives, in the real world, believing for something that this world does not have to offer... HOPE"
5,A droll take on a very troubled time,"Lately, I have read quite a few historical novels set during the periods of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and pre-World War II. This is not a novel, although it is a story-telling. I had never heard of Egon Erwin Kirsch, but will remember his name from now on. In Sensation Fair: Tales of Prague, he begins with his childhood memories, which resurface at odd times throughout the book. He moves on to a series of events in his career as a journalist on the crime beat. He also includes his experiences as a grunt in WW I, striving to become an officer because their benefits were so much better. His humor is light at times and other times very dark, as befits the period and corruption of his time, with much irony. I was sorry when he had no more tales to tell. If you are a history buff, Egan Kirsch will open a new perspective on the machinations before and after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the match that enflamed Europe in WW I."
1,Mary Kay Oil Control Lotion,This product is not for someone who blots more than twice a day. The Mary Kay Oil Mattifier is much much better. For really oily skin like mine this product was NOT effective whatsoever at minimizing shine. I still had to blot around 10-12 times a day (average). This product seems more suited for someone who may be shiny during summer months but fine the rest of the year. Definately NOT for someone who experiences oiliness & shine all year round!
4,Good Stuff,"I have oily/acne prone skin and i like using this stuff before i put on my makeup and it really helps me keep my oil under control all day plus it doesn't break me out. It could smell a little better, but its not horrible. Would definitely recommend to someone with oily skin!"
2,stale,"I tried to overlook it but since I apply it to my face, it is hard. It smells rancid which means it is old stock. It is not worth returning for the price , so I will just buy another one."
3,Old? out of date?,"As much as I like Mary Kay, I think I got the price I did, becasue the stuff seems to be old or out of date....the gold ring was missing on the cap which makes me think it may have been seconds. The product works fine, but is a little runny."
4,Handy Little Contraption to Have!,"I use mine with my Palm M505 (color version) and it is a very useful little tool. Because of it's compact size, I carry it with me in my purse always, and since I go nowhere without my Palm, I always have a camera! During a recent remodeling project at home, my husband and I went on many ""exploring"" trips to see if we could find just what we wanted for this or that....with the camera, I took pictures rather than just taking notes on where we found something - it was very helpful. Plus the ease of downloading during a sync operation can't be beat!"
4,magnet not useful,The push pull device works great. Don't expect to hang it by its magnet as it has not enough strength to hold up a tiny piece of paper. Put on a string and hang it from a hook.
2,Definately NOT a book for beginner,"The illustrations are great, but the so-called step by step, is actually from black and white to coloured. If you are looking for a book to learn how to draw Japanese style animation characters, keep looking. But if you are looking for a cool Japanese animation art reference book, this will be a good choice."
1,A Bit Of A Disappointment,"An avid Manga and Anime fan, I'd do anything to be able to create beautiful Manga characters, or even practice the technique used to eventually create a more personal character style. I had hoped this book would sort of ""take-me-by-the-hand"" and teach me how to start sketching manga characters before anthing else. But, it's more or less copying rendering and coloring techniques.the artwork published is neverthless impressive."
2,"""Someone's calling me back from the dead...""","Nothing really special here, except an unusual design for the CD casing. Songs contained on the CD are Moonlight, LOA House, Black Hill Santitarium, From The Other Side and Voodoo. An absolute must for King Diamond fans who must have everything."
4,The Best Ice Cream Maker Cookbook Ever,"It's a very nice book, with lots of fun stuff to do inside. I have tried a couple of them, they turned out nice."
2,Beautiful Outside Outdated Inside,"Beautiful hardback cover, however entire book is without photos. I guess in 1998, this was not a popular feature. Book looks outdated and boring. Needs an update and re-issue to be in-tune with the times."
5,ENCYCLOPEDIA FOR ICE CREAM,"A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR ICE CREAM COOKBOOK LIBRARY. I LOVE ALL THE RECIPES BUT ESPECIALLY THE CHAPTER DEDICATED TO ""THE LIGHTER SIDE""-YOU CAN HAVE YOUR ICE CREAM AND YOUR REDUCED CALORIES, TOO. GOOD REFERENCE COOKBOOK. THIS BOOK HAS A RECIPE FOR EVERY TASTE YOU CAN THINK OF PLUS SAUCES,GRANITAS, FROZEN YOGURTS, SORBETS AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FROZEN DESSERTS."
2,Book review,"This book is just so-so. I agree with another reviewer about pictures would be great. I have been using the one that came with my ice cream maker and found on the internet over any in the book so far. I will be trying a few over the summer, but feel I could have been just as well off by not purchasing this book."
3,"OK, But No Nutrional Info Provided For Any of the Recepies","Just got this book, and while it does seem to have an ample supply of different recepies (and all that contain raw eggs do have you cook them into a custard, unlike the Ben & Jerry's cookbook), none of them contain any nutritional information. I purchased this book along with my Cuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Ice Cream Maker, and I guess the recepies included with the instruction manual (there are quite a few, all with nutritional info) spoiled me. I suppose if you're making ice cream the last thing you might care about is calorie, fat, cholesterol, etc. details. But for me, I am so conditioned to tracking the nutritional info of the food I am ingesting (even ice cream!) and I am so used to this info always being readily accessible, that I returned this book. It seems this content would have been a minor addition and I feel it was a big mistake for the author not to provide it."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book based on other reviews, but was disappointed when I received it. I really prefer to see some pictures when looking at a cookbook and there are none in here. I also did not realize every recipe in the book requires cooking before making the ice cream. I don't want to take the extra time to mix and cook,cool, and then make ice cream. I have returned the book for that very reason. If you have the time for the extra steps you might like this book."
2,Pretty much the same as others,"I have bought several books on ice cream making and have been making lots of ice cream since Christmastime 2009. I have been working to perfect a recipe for sugar free ice cream and found nothing of assistance. I have found lots of recipes online and lots of assistance in unpublished sources, but very little in the books.Perhaps when I have perfected my own recipes, maybe I'll have to write my own book."
2,Didn't know making ice cream was so hard!,"Bought a Kitchen Aid ice cream bowl for my husband and this book. After looking at the recipies, I realized what a poor choice I had made. Dumb me, I thought you just put some milk/cream, fruit or other ingredients into the bowl, mixed it with the Kitchen Aid and had ice cream. My husband wanted to make french vanilla so he slaved over the stove for at least an hour, then had to do more things to actually create the final product. It's a lot easier to just buy Breyers!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This is the worst book of ice cream maker recipes I have come across. it Includes recipes that are not complete such as the ""Enlightened Vanilla Ice Cream"" recipe that calls for only cream, sugar and vanilla extract. I believe they left out a major ingriedient....maybe some egg whites or yolks to give it thickness. I tried this recipe and ended up with 100% liquid. What a waste of time!"
5,Great book,"Great recipes for homemade ice cream, and easy to follow instructions. Definitely a MUST have in your home. Even if you only use this book a few times, it's well worth the purchase. However, you'll probably use it over and over again, because there's so many good recipes you'll want to try. Definitely worth the buy!"
2,Sound problems with the DVDs,"The low rating is for the sound quality on the DVDs, not the movies (I give 5 stars to those). The dialog is so quite that I can't hear it. It is really bad in Casablanca where I had to change the volumn from 14 in the music seans to 25 for dialog, and still had trouble hearing it.No one else has mentioned this in a review, so maybe I just got a bad set and should return it for a replacement."
5,Collection contents.,"This collection will include the titles: The Big Sleep, Casablanca, Key Largo, & The Maltese Falcon on four separate discs.Each of these rates 5 stars by itself - should this collection then rate 20 stars ?Actually - I've seen the existing DVDs of these movies and not the actual ones in this collection. But since I have no information about any new editions being produced they are likely to be the same.A great way to start a Bogart DVD collection."
5,At steal at this price.,"By far The Big Sleep is the most underrated film ever made. This alone is worth the price. The interaction and chemistry of Bogart and Bacall is second to none. Even if your a fence sitter on classics, this set is an absolute must. I purchased this set about 6 months ago and still can't believe it does not sell for more."
1,Bogart collection,"I thought the movies would be presented in their original format, however they appear in standard TV format. For those with widescreen TV's (like me)you will be disappointed."
2,famous movie,"I would wait for the two disc release ( if it ever arrives ) of Maltese Falcon, and Big Sleep.Maltese Falcon was sloppily restored, and is missing the tail end of the scene during which Bogart was threatened by Lorre, in Bogart's own office. I do not know why the scene was deleted, but it came as a surprise!"
4,"Easy to play, great for learning",These cards are great for my 7 year old who is an advanced reader and bored with many of her age-appropriate educational games. She loves learning how to pronounce the names of other countries and figure out what countries border each other. Great for the rest of the family too ~ who couldn't use a little refresh on their geography?
3,Book is Just as Disgusting as the Manual.,"Book is pure and simple sickening. lots of info but all presented in a sickening array of cluttered calculator data. is the book worth twenty dollars? I suppose so, but it will make you sick trying to read through the enormous array of confused and confusing examples and language. mr. cane needs some writing courses."
2,A very broad but cluttered calculator book.,"Book is very broad but very cluttered. The reader is hit with a confusing array of calculator features that he or she will never use unlerss they will teach the hp12c calculator to other instructors! But, then what??"
1,Aweful,"I haven't even read one chapter and I have already made my decision about this textbook. There are glaring errors every page! And I'm not talking about just the exercises, in the examples and descriptions, too! I am not normally able to spot errors in this textbook, but this is just crazy. A rip off of money. The prose is forced, boring, and dull. Sounds like someone wrote this thing at the last minute."
1,Toilet Paper,"This book has SO MANY errors. Every page I find a mistake, and I don't mean little spelling errors I mean they didn't add correctly, or the formula that's being presented is wrong(!!!), or their charts are labeled incorrectly.Also most the problems start out with ""refer to Exercise __"" which is on some other page or sometimes another chapter, so you have to constantly flip back and forth. Even the solutions manual was like that (which, by the way, you will need, because it's not always clear how they got their answers- only to find out they did it wrong!!)And worse of all is the tables in the appendixes are not labeled right, so the book refers you to appendix D table 4, but it's the wrong set of values, the one you actually want is printed on the inside back cover that's not labeled at all!Did this book not get edited? I kept wondering if maybe it was a semester project for some class."
4,The Essential Father is an excellent book!,"An enjoyable, informative book that doesn't spend time trying to find a cause to disagree with. Srodes is a masterful story teller who reports information without judgement, a refreshing concept these days.Very pleasant book to re-read. Makes one wonder if this quality of leader will ever emerge again."
3,Colonial Superman,I found this book worthwhile but I would have liked more personal and perhaps more intimate insights about Franklin as a person. Perhaps a bit more his writing would have helped. The book does a good job describing Franklin's surroundings and the people with whom he associated but I did not get a thorough enough picture of the man himself. Franklin was quite remarkable and the book does make that clear however. I would have liked more about his scientific exploits and also about his personal relations. The other characters in the book are too often the diplomats with whom he dealt and they are actually secondary players in this drama. The book did not have Franklin jumping out of it altough it was reasonably informative. I have read more interesting things about this man.
4,Ross this the king of money-making books!,This is another one of his best-sellers! Veryinformative!(web site name)
5,A great butt-kicker!,"Mindy is an excellent instructor, and this is by far my favorite spin bike video! It provides a great all-around workout -- cycle, legs, cycle, arms, cycle, core. I love listening to Mindy, she is very encouraging and makes the workout fun. Not gonna lie, it's tough - a great butt-kicker!"
5,Wonderfully sweet story,"My mother bought this wonderful book for my 18-month old son and it has become one of his favorites. It is a wonderfully sweet story about the love of Grandparents for a grandchild. Several of the story items fit exactly with things my son does, making it almost seem like the story is about him. This is a book I will keep forever to remind me of what he was like as a young child."
4,Heaven is Having You,"very cute book! I also love Love is a Handful of Honey. This book, Heaven is having you, is more for the grandparent and child."
3,Magic Date Ball,I love the original Magic 8 Ball and was so excited to see it in pink. However this one has gliter in the solution and the gliter seems to collect right around the viewing spot which makes it very hard to read the response to your question. But the answers are cute when you can read them.
3,Just so you know...,"According to the package, the Magic 8 Ball Date Ball was issued in 2000, which makes the product nearly 8 years old. No wonder the pop-up answers don't pop up so readily anymore. I bought 2 Date Balls as gifts for my nieces, imagining giggles when consulting the ball about pre-teen crushes. Disappointing responses (""I don't know"" and ""How should I know?"") seem to pop up more than normal. Shouldn't the magic of the Date Ball be that it DOES know all the answers when it comes to boys? Mattel needs to update the Date Ball. The product exterior is perfectly girly, glittery and exciting. The interior workings? Not so much."
5,Firey!,"How I let this book set for so long, I do not know; however, once I picked it up and got started I could not put it down.When Rachel Calloway meets Nicholas Hunter, the prosecutor who will prosecute her father for burning down his restaurant, she instantly looks at him as the enemy, but doesn't feel that way. The same goes for Nick.Not only did I want to know how long it would take Nick and Rachel to realize they were going to get together, but I had to know which of the three people I suspected was really the guilty party.Ms Smith wrote a book with plenty of suspense and some hot romance. Though, she has received accolades for this book, I tip my hat, stand and applaude and say BRAVO."
3,Just a 3.5 awright!!!!,"I've read other books by this author and will continue because I think Maureen Smith is a good writer, however, I wasn't blown away by ""Ghosts of Fire"". I really liked the characters Rachel Calloway and Nick Hunter. They were well developed, and the mystery in the story plot kept my interest not the romance between these two people. I've noticed that when the author focuses on romance it is too hot to handle such as ""Touch of Heaven"", but some how when she combines both mystery and romance, the romance falls a little short. I would recommend this book, but not for the price I'd paid. Any other reader wouldn't be disappointed if you're really looking for a mystery with a little romance to pass the hot summer months away."
3,"Haven't seen it yet, but here are the contents","Contents include:The TNT Punch / The Sign of the Snake / Blow the Chinks Down! / Breed of Battle / Dark Shanghai / Mountain Man / Guns of the Mountains / The Scalp Hunter / A Gent from Bear Creek / The Road to Bear Creek / The Haunted Mountain / War on Bear Creek / The Feud Buster / Cupid from Bear Creek / The Riot at Cougar Paw / The Apache Mountain War / Pilgrims to the Pecos / Pistol Politics / Evil Deeds at Red Cougar / High Horse Rampage / ""No Cowherders Wanted"" / The Conquerin' Hero of the Humbolts / Sharp's Gun Serenade"
2,Surprisingly Dull,"This book starts with a bang, but whimpers from the second chapter all the way to the end. The writing is leaden, the plot is drawn out, and the characters are unsympathetic. The final chapters provide a twist that does help to explain the relationship between the father and son at the center of this story, but the ending is so contrived and implausible, and the characters so disconnected, that its hardly worth reading all the way through."
4,"Fast-paced, suspenseful and troubling","This book moves quickly but still delves deeply into the psyche of a cruel and gifted teenager (one of those ""beautiful people"" most of us remember from high school) and the fragile, dysfunctional relationship he has with his father. The lengths the characters go to to avoid facing painful truths will have you pondering how far your own familial loyalty would stretch. I read it all in one sitting; short and suspenseful, it's hard to put down.I also enjoyed the book because it's a male narrative; most of the books I read are from a female voice."
2,Diamond Dogs: A Novel - not for the younger teens!,This book contains perversion which should not be read by young teens.
5,What a wonderful book,I bought this book for my daughter who was 8 at the time. And she loved it. She still brings this book to camp with us at the age of 10.This is a great book. Made with lots of love and imagination. And it would make a great gift for any child into the fae folk.
3,fun with air,Great toy but not for the little kids. It takes a lot of strength to pull the trigger on the airzooka. Takes a while to figure out how to aim the thing but once you are over the learning curve you are messing up coiffures all over the place. Good times.
2,Broke the first day and wrong color was sent,"I ordered 2 of these for my sons birthday. He had played with them before and they can be a lot of fun. One of them broke the very first day it was used and there is no way to repair it because the plastic broke. They also sent the wrong color, not that it mattered because he never got an opportunity to use it. I think this could be really fun for boys if it's working."
3,Fragile Design,"My son and I had a hard time getting the rings to lock on both sides. Eventually we did it by ignoring the instructions and winging it. After a half hour of usage the edge ring (1cm thick) that holds the diaphragm in place came off and we couldn't get it to snap back in place even with tools. We have to keep re-taping it now. The tolerances of dimensions for plastic tabs and snap-through's seem too narrow. It could use some serious re-engineering. When it stays together, my son finds it fun."
4,AirZooka Air Gun,Items were shipped very well. The Airzooka is an awesome toy that is really fun for little kids (they freak out) all the way up to old people (they freak out too). Little babies tend to cry ;-(
3,Interesting but a bit dry,"If you really enjoy reading Australian history, and have a bit of a background in academic history, you will probably like this book. Lots of references and research, with connections to current theories in feminist theory and Australian history. Avoid it if you aren't willing to slog through a certain amount of academicese to get to the interesting stuff."
1,Interesting topic poorly written,"The title is (after reading) obviously over-hyped since I failed to find anything ""depraved"" in the book. The topic of telling the life styles of early female ""transportees"" is fascinating but this appears to be some sort of a graduate thesis which was attempted to be expanded into book to sell (with a catchy title). The ""book"" is massively repetitive, shallow, and refers to the same people/incidents over and over. Even as a thesis, it is very disorganized."
3,"Inconsistent, poor recording quality","Most of the pieces were recorded separately at various points in Mr. Caldwell's illustrious career. Sometimes the sound quality was pretty poor, as if they were being recorded with a tape recorder. However, the classic Ravel piece which leads off the album is a classic performance from the late 1960's. Mr. Caldwell really shines here. His playing was quite outstanding and it is unfortunate it wasn't recorded better."
3,Good Not Great,"Shipping & cost were great. The music is good, but not great. 2 discs for the price of one is nice though."
2,very light weight.,these are very soft and light weight. maybe they are good to wear inside shoes. you could go by any pedicure place and get a pair of these for .50 to $1.00.
1,Too soft to cushion,"I really expected these to be what they say...cushions, but the material they are made from is way too soft to provide any cushioning effect."
4,"A little pricey, but do the job","I bought these to aerate my toes ( I have chronic athletes foot), This is kind of an off-label use, but I'll try anything. These work OK, but cotton seems to work better because it's porous."
5,Best toe cushions around.,I purchased the Pedifix toe cushions for my mother. She says they are very soft and comfortable. Her toes are very sensitive from a prior surgery that went wrong and wearing shoes is very painful. The toe cushions give her alot of relief.
1,pedifix supersoft toe cushions - horrible,just a cheap piece of cut foam - too flimsy to be of any use. Wasted my money. No return instructions or address. Such a rip-off.
4,shai's new singer,this is the first thing i've heard from shai hulud after thier first singer and drummer left. i'm not dissapointed but this is just a split and most of these songs are covers. linolium's cool though so is set your body ablaze. another victim is ok not that good though.
3,"Good for beginners, but...","This book is a great book if you are just starting to build your bar from scratch. However, there should always be more than one recipe book in your bar. If you intend to do some serious bartending, this is a good place to start, but don't limit yourself to this one book."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"I have been wanting to be a bartender for a long time and a co worker suggested i buy this book because that is what they use. half of the book is pointless crap if you want to work in a bar. I read some of the reviews on here and saw a few that said the recipies are wrong so I checked them. I asked my bartender friends and co workers how to make half of these recipes and 75% were wrong. Most dont use enough of one ingredient, some add ingredients, some are missing ingredients, and a couple are even in the wrong glass. 2 actually have the same name but are two totally different drinks. They are simple mistakes like 1/2 instead of 1 1/2 its like a paper that wasnt spell checked its really annoying and rediculous. This is not a college paper there should not be this many rediculous mistakes. This book was a total waste of 4 dollars."
5,Great Short Read Filled with Info,"I really enjoyed reading this book, it was short and did not take long to read. It is also filled with a lot of info and can't wait to keep referencing it."
4,awesome,"The book is like a refresher for me. I took bartending school and forgot some of the stuff I learned, but this helped me with that."
1,Bartending for Dummies,"The actual Bartending for Dummies is a great book, but this is the mini book version, although Amazon does not say so. It doesn't have as many recipes or information. That's why it's so inexpensive."
4,Love This Book,Very informative. Well put together. LIke the fact that you also have drinks listed by name so you can find them if you have no idea what's in them. Also like the fact that they use sweet and sour in drink recipes instead of things bars don't really carry.
2,wasn't very impressed,"There were parts of this book that were very imformative and well researched. However, as a professional bartender and author, I feel there were a lot of mistakes he made in writing his book.A lot of the recipes given were incorrect. Certain drinks like an Old-fashioned, and a Sex on the Beach should not be wrong. Also, I noticed that he had ten or fifteen drinks featuring Absolut Vodka. Absolut Vodka is a very low-rated vodka, and should never be involved in a recipe for a good drink. Crystal Palace or 5 o'clock vodka would have sufficed just fine."
1,"Not only abridged, but badly formatted",This kindle book is one of the most difficult to read that I have ever purchased. The formatting for the recipes does not fit on the kindle screen so all of the words end up in a mish mash that is very difficult to decipher. Chapters are not clearly defined and it is difficult to search for a drink and find the recipe quickly. I am very disappointed that I spent money on this book and would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Pretty good,This book is really good in the sense that it teaches basic grammar and has useful phrases...I would recommend this book to anyone who looks wants to start with the basics!
3,French Phrases for Dummies,French Phrases for Dummies is OK but difficult to find a phrase in a hurry when you are trying to communicate with someone quickly.
1,"Not very good, but not useless","Written by three people, it contains errors throughout. The pronunciation guidance seems to change depending on which author wrote the page. When I saw ""samedi"" pronounced wrong, I knew this book was not going to be very good. It has it pronounced right in another section, but this just made me wary. The structure of this book would be for studying before going to a French speaking country. If you are going to Montreal in a week, then this book will not help you after you get off the plane. I found over 50 errors in the book and was going to send them to the publisher, but in the end I just dropped the book in the paper recycling booth at the Salvation Army."
1,Not recommended,"I do not recommend this item. It is very easy to accidentally reset the combination to a random unknown number. If someone who does not know how the reset procedure works, it is very easy for them to; 1) Open the lock using the correct combination. 2) Lift the handle up and slide it into the 'change' mode. 3) Change the combination rollers to a random number.I also don't like this item because if you want to leave it unlocked for a period of time and don't want to leave the rollers on 'your number', you must roll off the number. Of course, then the bolt won't lock until you change it back to 'your number'.This is where I got in trouble. We have this lock installed on a wooden gate. My wife accidentally did the procedure above. Luckily she only changed one number and I was able to reset the lock. I do not want to explain the reset procedure to everyone in my family that I give my combination to. So if this ever happens again, this lock is going to get the deep six..."
5,DISCOVER THE BUDDHA,"A wonderful introduction into a basic understanding of Buddha. The cards in this deck are great meditation tools - one for each week of the year. Osho brings a contemporary freshness and understanding to a special selection of sutras, taken from Buddha's main work THE DHAMMAPADA. I can recommend this title as a gift for the upcoming holiday season."
4,"Fits perfectly, but has a minor flaw.","This products fits my MacBook perfectly and makes typing a lot quieter. It covers the keys, the trackpad button, and both sides of your trackpad (where the palms of your hands might rest when you type). Maybe mine cover has a defect, but I notice oily like smudges on the keys and palm rests. They can be removed with a good laptop cleaner, but it's an annoyance to have to do so. I usediSkin ProTouch 13"" MacBook Keyboard Protector - Arcticfor my previous MacBook. It only covers the keys, but I thought it did a better job."
2,"Great concept, faulty execution","I've tried and tried, and I can't get mine to fit. The little bubbles for the keys aren't in exactly the right places for some of the keys, and I have to keep stretching the skin down so that the click button bubble fits correctly over the click button. It's not awful, but it's darn annoying. I bought this hoping it would be better than the iSkin I previously bought, but it's not. I wouldn't call the Rasfox skin a waste of money, but it sure is an annoyance."
4,"Good, with some down side.","Like the cover because it protects Bit awkward to get used to, but very good once you do. My only real complaint is that it pulls off when I open the laptop and when it pulls off stuff, like dog hairs, etc, get stuck on tacky backside, which are very difficult to get off."
2,was ok but sort of useless,"I got this for my boyfriend's macbook about a year ago. He used it for several months and was constantly annoyed by it. He said it got dirty easily, was hard to type with, and he constantly had to readjust it. Eventually he decided it was harder to keep clean and nice than the computer itself and not really worth the hassle so he threw it away. It looks nice and everything at first, but i think overall it's pretty useless."
2,Didn't fit,Based on the description this is exactly what I needed. But when I received it it didn't EVEN fit my keyboard! I have returned it but have yet to see a credit.
3,Rasfox Keyboard Skin,"Very nice product although it's not suitable for the new white macbook keyboard. It doesn't fit over the ""enter"" key"
2,egh...,"The cover fits the exterior edges of the macbook nicely, but is not a good fit for the keys or trackpad. The cover sticks up over the keys to the point that I can't see the letters. It also doesn't fit around the trackpad enter key. It does mute the sound of the keys, which is nice, but because it doesn't line up properly there are a lot of typing errors.I would honestly return it but it was cheap enough that it isn't worth it."
4,"Sturdy, Colorful Puzzle","My 5-year-old enjoys this large, sturdy, brightly colored floor puzzle. We're hoping it gets her interested in learning Spanish, too."
5,Excellent Security Resource,"This book contains very solid advice on how to secure your network. Early on the book describes things you must do in order to keep your network secure from Hackers, Viruses, and other external and internal threats. The author explains not only things the hacker will try, but things that we as administrators often forget to do or do incorrectly. The straightforward style of the author gets the point across in no uncertain terms, security is a must in today's world. If you need advice on what you should be doing and why you need to do it this is the book for you."
4,Fun way to get to know a mate (or potential mate) better!,"My husband and I played this game with a couple of friends I was fixing-up. The questions sparked revealing conversations -- things you might be cautious talking about early in a relationship -- but because it was a game, it was ""ok"" to talk about those issues. It's a great way to learn more about the people you're playing the game with - even if you've known them a long time. We played for four hours and could have played longer. If you're looking for a hysterical game with non-stop laughs, this isn't the best choice. But if you're looking for a pleasant evening with friends - with lots of good conversation - I haven't found a game better than this one."
4,Great Fun for All!,"I absolutely love this game! Makes a great party game for couples ... one warning, though -- couples in serious relational discord may not want to participate in this game -- Issues are definitely exposed during play!"
3,Bachmann digital commander,"If you are a ""little"" train enthusiast this is the product for you. If however you plan on remote dcc switches forget it. This has only ten control slots so if you have two trains and a couple switches you are fine. More than that i suggest going with a bigger ""prosumer"" type of product like an MRC or something of that nature.hope that this helps."
2,Not the best scale for a 7 year old,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for a 7 year old. Big mistake. HO scale is too small. Hard to put train on tracks and even harder to keep it on track. If i had to do it over I would probably go with bigger O scale. Much more stable and easier to handle. I suppose HO would be OK for an older person, especially if you have limited space.."
4,Okay but....,"I was always a big fan of the gossip girl series but i have to say this one was not as good as the first two. I still could not put it down but Blair seemed brattier then ever Nate who once was thought of as a cute preppy boy who just liked to get high seems like a horny snobby pothead and I even found my self skiping certain parts because they were moving soo slow. If you have not read the first two Gossip Girls read those before you read this one I cant say I am not still hooked on the series but All I Want Is Everything was not everything i wanted,nor expected"
5,A fabulous book that you wont put down.,"The book is just exciting and you can't put it down. At least I know I didn't. After reading the first and second I was hooked. It took me about 6 days to read all three. That is a record for me considering I don't like to read. This was a great book to read, especially while on a vacation. I can't wait for the 4th book to come out. They are so interesting and always something new is happening. There is never a dull moment in the book. For that matter in any of them. The first few pages are a great lead to start the book off."
3,Not as Good As The First Two In The Series...,"Now that Blair and Nate are over, Serena and Blair have become bestfriends again. Vanessa is in deep trouble for posting a video of Nate and Jenny half naked on the internet, getting Dan mad at her. A rock-star Flow becomes obsessed with Sernea, and falls in love with her while Serena has no interest in him. Blair then goes with Serena to St. Barts for Chrismas vacation.Theres not much to say about this one, its defenitely fluff, I gave the first two installments in this series 4 stars, but this one 3 since its not that good."
5,When Gossip Is Good,"Oh my God this just has to be like my favorite series of all time! I just simply love Serena, how she is so beautiful and yet doesn't act like a total ... like Blair. Not that I don't like Blair, she's actutally my second favorite character (although she does get on my nerves sometimes how she disses Aaron and Miles). Oh, and I just HATE Nate (hey..that rhymes) and how he just dumped Blair for a ninth grader. There relationship should be ILLEGAL!Anyways, back to the book. The series is really good and my favorite so far has been ""All I Want Is Everything"". Blair and Serena friends again is just too cool. But I must mention tha before you just buy it the story does contain underage drinking, smoking, and cussing like a sailor. But overall, the story is hot. You'll just fall IN LOVE with the characters. Way to go Cecily!!"
3,Still funny...,"I read the book very fast, but I'm still not sure whether I liked it more than the previous two or not. The writing style is still funny which makes the book very enjoyable. I admit that these books are not the best out there, not even close, but I'm addicted to them. I guess this series is my guilty pleasure.My only complaint is that the story gets a little repetitive, the characters doing the same things over and over again (Nate getting high a few times a day, Serena shopping at Barneys). I hope the next books will be better."
1,PARENTS BEWARE!!!!,"Parents BEWARE!!! This author writes complete filth. Her frequent use of the ""f"" word is proof of that. She uses it throughout ALL of her books, she writes about teens smoking joints, casual sex, children (8-10 years of age) drinking alcohol like it is common throughout the USA. This author has written her books to appeal to the 13-16 year olds. Do we really want our young adults and young teens reading filth like this? Where have our morals and values gone? I have personally had her books removed from our schools library and the local public library. Check them out in any bookstore, your jaw will drop."
4,hm,okay i think this book is awesome! it's a bit stereotypical trashy teen novel but it's entertaining and a good way to pass the time between school and rehearsals and soccer practice. just don't expect to be challenged.
4,Holiday Drama at Its Finest,"Blair and Serena are best friends again - and that's a good thing for when she's with her mother and Cyrus in St. Bart's for Chistmas. Who would help her get through all the new family drama going on in her life that used to be perfect?Dan and Vanessa are in love but go through several hurdles to overcome differences. Jenny and Nate are happy - at least they seem to be until he goes to Maine. Serena is serenaded by Flow and a strange Bird. Miles makes the moves on Blair much to the chagrin of Aaron. And what about a baby?This third book in the Gossip Girl series is the best so far. Of course, it leaves the reader hanging on for the next book, but isn't that what good series books do - even if they are for teens? These books are wonderful because you can have all the drama you want without it screwing up your own life!"
5,All I Want Is Everything,"All I Want Is Everything, Gossip Girl novel, written by Cecily von Ziegaeser is a book full of action and drama. I read this book a few weeks ago and I have read it along with all the others in the series. This book is number 3 in the series. So I suggest that you read the two others before starting this one because it might not make sense. In this book, Blair and her new best friend Serena go to St. Bart's for the Christmas vacation with Blair's family. Blair recently broke up with her boyfriend Nate and is meeting all new kinds of guys, but at the same time, she really misses her ex-boyfriend. Also Blair, the main character in this book, is trying to get into Yale. If you are a teenage girl, who loves realistic fiction books, you will love this series! Enjoy your reading!"
3,good!,i loved this book...like i have loved all of them but nodoby is as pretty as they make serena seem...nobody is perfect like that and it makes blair seem ugly. The part where she doesnt put on anything nice for the dinner and she was still 10x prettier than any girl on the island....and then aaron realizes how BEAUTIFUl she is when he gets over blair its just kinda fake but i still love love loveeee these books and u should read them. ALL 4 OF THEM!!!!
4,a great sister to sister gift,It was purchased for my three sisters. A great sister to sister gift! Our stories are all different but when reading the printed stories you quickly can relate. A fun read.
4,Intriguing Plot,"Very good book. If you read ""By Reason of Insanity"" by Stevens, don't expect this book to be anything like it. It is, however, worth the time to read. It gets a little slow in the middle, but not enough to put down."
3,Surprisingly Good,"I was surprised how good this movie was. A bit of a shame it wasn't released in theaters while other worse films were. The Lazarus Project isn't amazing, but it nails it's goal as a psychological thriller. Definitely worth seeing, and if you're just looking for a psychological thriller you haven't seen, and won't be disappointed by, get this.The plot twists are managed very well; you don't know what is really going on until near the end. I thought the final scene was a bit over the top, but the overall experience of watching the movie was suspensful and kept me engaged to want to see what was going to happen next, and care for the main character, Ben. I was hoping he'd remember this or that, etc. Other than that very last scene, I can't think of any other faults with the movie at all...it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. It isn't Se7en, and it doesn't try to be. A lot of movies ruin themselves like that.Anyway, this is a good movie. Check it out."
4,"Do all of us deserve a second chance, don't you?","Supported by a smart script, the basic dramatic premise resides into rehabilitating missed existences of human beings who instead of having been sending to a better life, are sent to a dark Valley where the apparently redemption sense is masked of a merciless analysis of the human being under certain and prefixed conditions, where memory, feelings and all the emotional universe may supposedly be arranged and shifted for their own sake.What they didn't prevent is how the last human specimen would be far to react according the theory. A man of dark background who once was released understood and assimilated the value of the family as life's project. That feeling will be the key liberator that will break the impossed laws.A cult film since its immediate release."
1,Children deserve better.,"Julie Berg's book inaccurately gives the impression that she interviewed Tomie dePaola. However, she never interviewed him. She took quotes from newspapers and other media. Yet, she never credited those sources. Her facts are also in error. Poorly researched. Poorly written. A poor excuse for a biography. Children deserve better. An adult would do best to consult Barbara Elleman's wonderful retrospective look at Tomie dePaola's work, TOMIE dePAOLA, HIS ART & HIS STORIES. Children should simply read Tomie dePaola's autobiographical books: the ""26 Fairmount Avenue"" chapter book series and his picture books, such as, THE ART LESSON and THE BABY SISTER and NANA UPSTAIRS & NANA DOWNSTAIRS. Don't encourage Julie Berg to write more biographies by buying this one."
5,beautiful music,"Songs are sung in Hebrew and English, it also has the meaning of the words in english. Great way to learn so Hebrew. A Great Buy!"
3,Easy Read,"Easy to read, was exciting and interesting until the end. I was not happy with the ending. The story did not seem completed."
4,EXCITING READ,Jackie is definitely at her best with this novel. I really enjoyed her characters. I was just not happy with the ending. I felt she left her readers up in the air with Nico and Fontaine which were fabulous throughout the whole book. She could have written a much better ending. Is there another book with these characters in the making? I sure hope so. Would love to follow them. I found myself reading every free moment. When I do this I know I have enjoyed the book. Keep writing can't wait for the next book.
3,"Intriguing enough, but...","Intriguing enough story that I wanted to read until the conclusion, but not one of her best. Definitely not worth the money or worth keeping on my kindle."
4,BETTER THAN THE STUD,"This book is a very fast read. It's certainly better than The Stud which is the first book to have these characters. It's only a little over 200 pages and the language and actions are a little dated. if you a fan of jackie collins, you would like this book. if you are not and a first timer, be careful and try one of her more famous books such as hollywood wives or something of that matter."
3,So so read,"I thought this book was too short, there was more that could have been developed, I felt like a was left hanging"
3,It ended too soon,I love this book. I wish it lasted a few more chapters. Love that it was updated. Please update the World is full of married men!
3,The notch,"Not as good as some of her other books, but I still enjoyed it.I look forward to readingMore"
3,Good but too short,I'm used to Jackie Collins novels being long & juicy. This one was short & sweet. But a bit TOO short I'd say.
3,wasn't impressed,"This was much better than The Stud, but still not good. I just wasn't into the plot, and the characters were too generic and boring for you to really care about them.Read this and The Stud when you have read all other Jackie Collins novels. It seemed this novel was trying to do for Fontaine what Lucky would later do for Lucky Santangelo."
3,Jackie can write better [stuff] than this,"Of all the Collins' books I've read, this is one of my least favorites. I just didn't care for the two main characters. However, some of the dialogue did make me laugh out loud. It is a very quick read."
2,not nearly as good as her others,"This book didnt really come out to me. It was an alright book, but definantly not one of my favorites. Save your money for chances, and the whole santangelo books!"
5,The Bitch,Wonderful book Jackie did it again. I hope she never stops. Love the Santangelo saga and it's so entertaining she has me hooked
4,Classic Collins Camp.,"Sequel to Collins 'The Stud', this one sees her heroine Fontaine Khaled pitted against the wits of another high-flyer - the hard gambling Nico. A light, raunchy, entertaining page turner."
2,"If this wasn't a textbook, I'd never have read it.","This book aggravated me, Wolf would set up arguments and then never argue for them. He'd give a few vague examples that neither backed up or rejected his hypothetical argument. The book is money driven and gives a rip the rewards from the earth at all costs praxis. I would not recommend it."
5,A defense of globalization,"Martin Wolf cuts through the opinions and the generalities and takes readers directly to the numbers. From there, his thorough analysis explains to readers that the world is better off with free trade; that Adam Smith was correct, trade brings a positive sum gain, and that poverty continues to exist partly because there hasn't been enough globalization. He is also very balanced, equally criticizing and exemplifying both the proponents and detractors of globalization. The book needs to be read slowly, however and with great focus, especially for those without an economics background. Even having a few economics courses under my belt, I found some of Wolf's points got lost in the details. But he comes out of those details to explain his analysis in clear, thoughtful ways. The book greatly adds to the globalization debate."
2,"An academic, rather than refreshing, read","This book could have served a better purpose if Martin had selected to write in such a way that it focuses on either the educated general public (who may have a rudimentary knowledge of economics) or the well-read few who already have a strong grasp of the basic issues.Martin's writing is too heavy for the educated general public and, at the same time, huge chunks of the book dive into areas that are really common knowledge for the ones who are already well-read. I think he has unconsciously spread his net too wide.The writing style lacks the crispness expected out of a seasoned journalist. Sorry Martin, no offense."
1,Worse Ice Cream Scoop Ever!,I really don't write bad reviews unless I really feel I completely wasted my money. I know this ice cream scoop doesn't cost that much and you may be tempted to purchase it because it is so cheap but you shouldn't.I recieved this ice cream scoop really fast (plus) but it smelled horrible!The fluid inside the handle was leaking. I it would have cost me more in shipping to send it back than to get a refund. I wouldn't recomment this ice cream scoop for anyone. I don't know what the other person was talking about in their review but I wouldn't waste my time with this one.
1,Mislead,"This movie has been recommended by many Russians and I bought it for my aunt who was visiting. We were excited to receive it quickly and got settled in to watch and the problem began right away. We could not pick the language we wanted to watch the movie in, so we had to watch it in dubbed English without even the Russian subtitles. Although she understands English, it would have been nice to view it in the language we paid for. It really lost alot in the translation.If ordering foreign films, make sure you can actually hear it in the language you want it in!"
1,Going Back to the Store,This digital frame has probably the worst resolution I have ever seen. It will be going back to the store ASAP !! Shame on you PANDIGITAL
1,AWFUL!!,"I purchased a Phillips Digital frame for my mother for Christmas and absolutely loved it. A friend saw how excited I was about it and went and purchased a Pandigital frame for me. When I saw the pictures come up it was a real let down as the images and resolution were terrible. The Phillips was so much better and literally all you had to do was put the memory stick in and up came beautiful, crisp, and clear pictures. I am very surprised that Pandigital sells this product for the price that they do. I am going to have to return this and will eventually buy the same frame I bought for my mother."
2,"I knew Mr. Lewis, and he's not here!","Wyndham Lewis and I were more like brothers than anything else, so I take great offense to the pervasive coverup about the real life and views of Lewis that take place in this book. What of his belief in the Universal Debate? Or his idea for the Rotating Senate Whip? If you read this book, you wouldn't know about 'em! The omission of Lewis's idea for the Endless Speech Party - a party he founded but later betrayed - makes this book a juvenile attempt at a real review of Lewis. I did, however, enjoy the frank way in which Lewis's obsession with politics was delt with."
4,My Baby Broke!!,"I was reading the reviews for Jasmine the my sweet baby. And i agree with another lady on the batterie problem. After two months of having her, she had problems. SHe started talking like a squeaky, mumbling, alien. It was becouse her batteries are dying. So my dad looked everywhere to get them and could not find them. And there is no screw driver small enough to open her head. THis toy needs better batteries. AND like the women said, it has really no value if you dont have batteriessigned,Disapointed"
4,save your money,"Fine toy for the 36 hours that is worked. My 4 year old and 1 year old liked it, but after playing with it for a day and a half it was completely dead. We considered exchanging it for another, but decided it wasn't that great and kept our money. I suggest you do the same."
1,No ISP; don't buy,I have owned ( and still do have ) many makes and models of mail station from the past 12 years. I still have my Mivo 350 and it would operate fine if there was a connection. Its easy and affordable to use except theres no ISP currently servicing this gadget so don't buy it. This is an obsolete item that will not be serviced in the furture as it was made by Earthlink and then Cidco bought them out but currently in the year 2012 there is no ISP providing a connection for this gadget. Save your money and don't buy a worthless hunk of electronic waste.
4,So far great,"My mother-in-law's PC recently bit the dust. We suggested a mailstation for her instead of a PC. The unit set up without a hitch. She has used it now for about a month and loves it.She also takes it with her when she travels or visits, and has no problem in using it.I just ordered a second unit as a alternative to ur PC. We will use it for travel or backup should our broadband service go down.I think that the Mailstation is a great alternative to PC's. Many older pepole are frustrated by the complexity of standard PC's, etc. Simplicity and reasonalbe cost makes this a good choice...."
2,dissappointed,Once I brought this to install at my mother in laws I discovered that Earthlink since Feb 2012 no longer supports setting up new products of mail stations
5,Great Tea Glass,I love the Tervis insulated glasses! They are much better than other brands I've tried. The welding has stayed together better. My friends like the pretty decorations inside them. We buy the coastal themed ones.
3,Amusing toy,"I bought this for my nephew, aged 13, for Christmas. He really enjoyed it--I don't think it'd be a great choice for kids much younger because it takes a decent amount of strength to work it. It's also pretty loud, but 13 year old boys love that. I can see how it'd be fun to set up cans to knock over. It does require some assembly, but that was pretty easy. Overall, it's a fun toy for older kids."
1,Fun while it lasts,"Got this as a gift for a relative. It was fairly easy to put together, and once he got the knack down, he had fun tormenting his wife and cats with it. However, it was dropped from barely a few inches off the ground and broke. He superglued it back together, so we'll see if it still works - and if it works better. The toy is fragile and not made well. It broke less than a day after I gave it to him!"
2,Broke after 3 uses,I bought 2 airzookas for my 9 year old twins. This one broke on 3rd try- the plastic came undone- probably can be fixed but not sure how to secure the plastic again...
2,Band keeps coming apart,The band keeps falling off and a child cannot fix it by him/herself.Another not so fine product made in China.
2,wish it lasted a bit longer,"Fantastic fun. Shoots a blast of air across the room, people are baffled and surprised.Fill it with smoke and fire giant smoke rings!Sadly, the retaining ring for the flexible membrane came off after a day of adult use.I guess I have to agree, buy a nerf gun."
3,Fun while it lasted,"Unlike many reviews here, I found it went together pretty easily...line up the arrows and pull to snap into place, twist and pull, and it was good to go in under 5 minutes. We bought it for a White Elephant gift exchange, and I ended up with my own gift. Once you figure out how to aim (the sight actually worked fairly decent for me), you can consistently hit folks with an air ball. The firing action makes so much noise (WAP!!), good luck sneaking up on your dog...she moved before the air ball reached her. Had some fun with it, and then the membrane came detatched after a day. It is fixable, but meh, we had our fun. You might be better off spending the money on that Nerf bow and arrow set, or any Nerf gun."
1,Bad Book. Don't buy.,Segal is too presumptuous about how you as the reader think and feel. She is all about the touchy feely stuff. She expects readers to take 28 days per chapter and sit there and feel emotions. I thought the book was a waste of time.
1,Don't waste your money,"So I'm reading through this book when I find this sentence that says 'so you shouldn't expect to feel emotion fully with an unfit body, any more than you would expect to play chopin on an untuned piano' and I think oh wow, what does that do for everyone who isnt like absolutely perfect like the 'beautiful people' out in California?I mean if your unlucky enough to be born with something not physically regular, like Stephen Hawkins, then you wont feel emotion fully? or if your suffer some permanent physical injury during your life then you wont feel emotion fully after that happens? or if you have a weight problem, like the majority of Americans! then you wont feel emotion fully? And this is a book about emotional INTELLIGENCE?I dont think so, bro!More like 'Emotional Dumb and Dumber'My advice is like the reviewer from New York - don't waste your time or your money on this manual for airheads."
1,A waste of time period.,"It is common mistake that people think other people have better ways to live their lives. However, EQ, though a word of ""a la mode"" should belong to science. This book does not. The first Part is just a bad Yoga lesson. You will be much better off to take Yoga lesson from a qualified instructor. The second part is not practical at all. Many Similar books claim to teach those practical skills and Dilbert is the best of them. You don't need a book to teach you how to live."
1,I want my money back! Don't waste yours!,This book is NOT about emotional intelligence- it is about learning to get in touch with your bodily feelings. The author confuses intelligence with learned skills. You can't raise your IQ nor your EQ but you can improve your maths skills and your self-control and interpersonal skills- none of which she addresses. I was so disappointed and truly want to ask Amazon to refund my money!
2,Think about it first...,"I received this item as a gift. I wanted something that I could carry a couple of cards in, and protect my phone. This looked like it would work for me. This item does protect your phone, but there is one major problem with it. If you keep any cards in it, it causes the cover to press the buttons on your phone, which really drains the battery. I would look for another option before purchasing this item."
1,Terrible,"what a piece of crap, its cheaply made, doesnt stay closed, scratchs your screen. i would suggest never getting one, the leather isnt even real, the clip is junk, what a waste of money"
1,I got the wrong product TWICE!,The picture you're advertising for the case is not the one you're sending out.... Not once but twice did you send me the same WRONG pouch...The issue still has not been resolved
2,wallet,This is not exactly what I was looking for. It is very difficult to use the phone while in this wallet. You either have to take it out of the wallet or have a headset to use the phone. I would look for a holster or some kind of pouch before buying this.
3,fine,just finebought for dadhe's happy with itbut lacks screen protectorand little bit harder to talk by putting near ear
1,NO!!!!!,Possibly the WORST case for this phone ever conceived. It barely fits and obscures multiple buttons. If you purchase this case you need a cat-scan! However the leather would make a nice eye patch.
2,Leather wallet style pouch for Motorola Q,"I received a pink leather pouch rather than the one i ordered. i guess the company is trying to get rid of them. I can't, or won't use it and am not going to send it back as it's not that expensive."
2,Not recommended,"To start: The item I received was mostly, but not entirely, like the picture. And it's the not entirely part that got me. The image shows a full leather connector between the cover and the case. Mine had a .75"" or so pivot.And that's why I gave it away to someone else in the office. The cover felt flimsy, didn't fold back well, and just generally didn't work for me. I like the idea of it - the slots for cards, the open case for the keyboard, etc. But in practice I used it for about 5 minutes, and swapped out for a case that is no longer in stock."
2,Not bad for the price..,Not bad for the price. But really ineffective at protecting the Q's screen and being useful as a sturdy case. Not of high quality. But as expected.
4,Hard to talk on phone,"It works very well for the intent I purchased it for, which was to protect it in my purse from all the buttons being pushed and using up my battery even faster than it already does. But it is a bit of a pain to talk on the phone and have to hold the flap back folded over"
2,Entertaining in a brainless sort of way,"Talents. Elementals. Good guys. Bad guys. We've seen it all before. Blade of the Poisoner joins a multitude of other generic and contrived young adult fantasies. There's nothing new or particularly inspired; while it does move quickly enough, there's absolutely no substance. 'All sound and fury, signifying nothing...' If you liked this, try The Secret of Dragonhome by John Peel. More of the same doggerel."
5,Also good for preventing beard dandruff!,"I apply thus product twice a day to my beard. It has eliminated a problem with beard dandruff that no other product (including other moisturizing or anti-dandruff products and prescription Nizeral) had resolved. You won't see this listed as a benefit by the manufacturer, or anywhere else for that matter, but this is a miracle cure! Just a little bit goes a long way."
5,F A N T A S T I C PROCUTS,I've been using Goldwell Kerasilk for over a year and now I can't live without it !! It doesn't leave a residue after use and it make a silky shine and puts your short hair right back in place and you're ready to charge the world.This procuct is a hit - buy it - you will agree with me.
2,There's better out there,"I use kerasilk shampoo and conditioner for extra dry, damaged, and unmanageable hair. These are staples that I could not live without. The silk fluid to me makes no difference on my curly hair. I prefer redken glass to make my hair shiny and soft - this is almost just too light. perhaps it works better for straight and fine hair, but if you have curly hair, it's not thick enough."
4,"Illustrations great, writing sometimes a mouthful","Fun adventure of a little girl with her stuffed animal friends. Each page is dedicated to a different animal. Some of the poems are fun and witty, others can cause your tongue to fumble and stumble when trying to speak in a lyrical manner. Over all my daughter likes it and thus I have to recommend it."
5,It should be a classic!!!,"My one-year-old daughter adores this book. She shrieks and claps her hands throughout, pointing each new animal and even kissing them. Once we get to the end, she flips the pages back to the beginning and I have to read it all over again. But it's such a cute book, I don't mind at all. The illustrations are fantastic and hilarious. The story really captures the imagination of childhood; little ones will certainly relate to this wonderful tale."
4,A solid lens hood,"I purchased this lens hood (it's 46 mm) for my Lumix 20mm 1.7 lens. It should also work perfect for the 14mm prime lens. It's not branded, and like all rubber lens hoods is a little oily at first. That said, for the price it's pretty fantastic, collapses as expected, and hasn't had any wear and tear problems yet."
5,amazing and beautiful,"totally worth the thirty dollars I paid for it. looks way too expensive here though. i don't know why it went out of print, this score is one of the most original and beautiful i've ever heard; every song makes you feel like you are in that particular moment in the movie. my favories are ""starnight"" and ""mythical waters."" the song that plays on the menu of the dvd is ""starnight,"" for anyone who wants to know."
1,"Would love to buy the cd, but people put the price above $59.99 on here!","So therefore, I'll take my business elsewhere."
1,Archaic Information,I purchased this book for my High School aged son to read and use to help his overall speed in tennis. It's like going back in a time capsual...it may have been cutting-edge 2 or 3 decades ago but it's so old it isn't even readable. It has found a place on a stack with other books that didn't pan out. No teenager on earth would read it.
5,Very nice!,Very beautyfull dessert plates but not fogot to hand wash them becouse are very sensitive
4,hmm,This book was helpful except the fact that it didnt really help me on the unscrambling part and no 9th grade math problems...
1,My Little Baby: Bailey is not worth it!!,"My daughter recieved My Little Baby as a Christmas present. She looked it over, but quickly put it down. The little doll ALWAYS cries, and is often put in the closet to avoid the noise. The price of the little doll is not expensive, but considering my it was never played with and avoided, it was a waste of money. I discourage anyone from buying this item."
4,good for email,"I would rather not bother with virus protection at home, so the mailstation is perfect. I get Internet at work and use computer at home for other activities. I let the employer worry about virus protection updates."
4,"SMOOTH, ARTICULATE PLAYING","Another Solid Air Records release I got through Acoustic Music Resource. This is relaxed, smooth, articulate playing from first to last. Familiar changes beautifully coaxed from his guitars without unnecessary flash, but certainly proficiently. In the haste of my youth and sometimes chasing the next big thing I missed some pure solo guitar playing. I'm not flush with time even now, but I will set aside hours for music this beautiful. Recommended."
1,It leaks. Very poor quality,I purchased Fasco A173 as a replacement for leaky but otherwise functional inducer in my HEIL furnace. I replaced the leaky OEM part with the FASCO A173 paying attention what other reviewers said. As soon as I turned the furnace on ithe new A173 started leaking at the outlet. I tightened the hose clamp to no avail. It kept leaking from the outlet area. Rather than going thru the hassle of removing and returning the product I used RTV silicone to seal the leaky area. For now it works I guess untill the RTV silicone wears out. A poorly made product with no quality control.
5,Intercity (Heil / Tempstar) Furnace Flue Exhaust Venter Blower Fasco # A173,All fittings and ports are identical to the OEM blower. It installed easily and runs flawlessly. This product is highly recommended.
4,A little noisy,"Used to replace original blower on a nearly 30 yr old furnace. Functionally identical but obviously lighter construction. Works perfectly but noisier than the 30 year old item it replaced. Still, well worth the difference in price relative to OEM which is likely to be no improvement in quality. Price point especially important for a furnace that may not be with us that much longer.SUPPLIER IS FIRST RATE! Had item in my hand the day after ordering!"
5,Great Buy!,"Purchased this blower at 1/3 cost of new one installed.Installed it myself in one hour. Exact match, works great."
1,Gone and messed up a great game.,"Uno is a wonderful game, simple, requiring thought, tactics, and strategy, posessing a good balance of chance and ability, easily carried, simple enough for a sharp four year old, and challenging enough for any adult.Uno Attack pretty much ruined all the advantages, making the game only of interest to people who are fixated on the badly made gadget. With the card shooter, the game is much more heavily dependant on whether you get cards from the machine and how many. With the machine, it will no longer fit in a jacket pocket. And frankly, the novelty will wear off very quickly, and you'll go back to the original Uno."
5,UNO ATTACK!!,This is a great game to play. It is fun for children but also enjoyable for adults. Great for family night or for kids to play at a party.
1,never worked - don't waste your money,Our family enjoys the traditional uno so I thought this would be an exciting twist. NOT. The thing never worked. Cards don't come out. It even has a disclaimer to say that cards don't come out every time - more like they never came out. It goes BEEP WHHRRRR..then nothing. We tried like crazy to get the thing to work! Ended up throwing it away. Do not recommend. We went back to the simple deck of Uno Cards.
1,DOES NOT WORK DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This game does not work. The launcher does not shoot out cards. We have tried all the ""fixes"" we have read about and nothing works. We will be returning this game and will not buy another. I do not recommend it [...]"
3,Replacement cards,"Haven't purchased yet due to my fear about the problem with the cards jamming, etc., Have seen many questions asking where to get the cards. Had to fill in stars in order to provide a comment.I went to Mattel's site. If you click Customer Service, use the words, uno attack, under product assistant, click the game, then yes, then click lost parts, it brings up the only part available for the game, captioned Bag(Deck 1&2). I'm assuming these might be the replacement cards."
2,It's an OK game.,"Hi, Tom the 12 year old toy expert at your service. Uno attack, I remeber when I had this toy, it was great the first couple time you played with it. Then after the first 5 games or so the belt would barely move, you couldn't put a lot of cards in or the belt would'nt move at all, you couldn't hear the sound, then when you put in batteries it worked fine for like 2 games, then you had to like warm it up and crap. But when it works its a good toy.*************** My top 100 ranking: 87 ****************"
1,"nice concept, but poorly made","I like Uno. Educationally this toy helps with younger children matching colors and numbers. This toy however, did not work. I bought this toy and we have to stop between every 5 button pushes to clean the card shooter. It does not work and it does not store well. I would love to have it if it worked. I dread everytime someone says the Uno word because it means 90% of the time cleaning this thing. I will be sneaking this toy out of the house Christmas eve night and replacing it with Uno Spin that does work as promised."
4,Great Game,Its a beatiful combination of luck and strategy.Good for the whole family.I am 12 years old but took 30 minutes to play on my own.The play guidelines could have been a bit more detailed as i had to ask my father several doubts.But the game by itself is simply great.Thanks Mattel !...
4,UNO attack,I actually ordered this as a gift for someone else. But I do have the game and it is a favorite for the family to play. Being plastic I wonder how durable it is.
2,Would be more fun if it worked.,"I bought this game for my son's birthday last week. We love UNO and loved UNO attack the one night we played it. The next night, the machine wouldn't spit out any cards. I have tried everything to fix it but to no avail. Will have to return it.With all of the problems I have read about this machine, Mattel engineering needs to get on it.It would not be a difficult problem to fix. I would not recommend buying this game, but if you do, keep the receipt."
4,A new way to play Uno,"I have played Uno more times than I can count and this just adds a little spice to the game. Instead of drawing cards when needed, you push the button and you either get none or it spits a bunch out at you. The kids enjoy watching the cards fly out at them and there is more anticipation when playing. Definitely recommended for those who are tired of playing the same old card game every night."
3,Great fun...when it works.,"I LOVE this game. It's fun in its unpredictability. However, since the moment we got it, we've had problems with it. Sometimes it will work just fine, others it will be a pain. The wheels roll just fine, until we put cards in it. Then it just kind makes the noise but doesn't produce anything. Then other times it seems like it needs to warm up to work properly. And it eats batteries, causing us to put new ones in everytime we play it. It's sad. I love this game, but we often end up playing monopoly rather then fool around with the Uno Attack hoping it will work."
1,Great Concept. Where's the cardssss????,"Great idea to capitalize on the UNO card game. If it worked, it would be hours of fun instead of Christmas Morning frustration. It's brand new out of the box, rollers clean, new batteries and it is a piece of junk. It's being returned for a refund as soon as possible.1 star because zero was not an option."
1,Piece of Junk,"Purchased this for our grandchildren. IT DID NOT WORK! Unfortunately we had thrown away the original packaging, so I assumed that it could not be returned. It gets zero stars from this household even if the form does require at least one star be entered."
4,Fun family game,We just got this game for x'mas and everyone in my family enjoy playing it including my 4 years old son and 67 years inlaws
4,Fun for the whole family,We have a lot of fun playing this as a family. The kids crack up if the adults get a bunch a cards attacking them. good fun for the whole family.
5,Great family fun,"It is a great family game to play, even my four year old loves it. I only have one complaint, the wheels that are to spit out the cards don't always work properly."
3,Durability issues,Its a fun game with a new twist but my launcher broke in the 6th round of the first time we played it. You could hit the button 100 times and the motor never turned dispensing cards. It would ding three times like its supposed to when its dispensing cards but it didn't. Mattel's customer service line is a pain as well. I was told 3 times that the call volume was too high and the telephony system hung up on me. The fourth time after answering my language was english I just hit a bunch of numbers and was promptly transferred to a customer service representative. Guess they were not so busy that time. I got an American which was a real surprise and she was very helpful. She eventually decided to ship me a whole new game free of charge. I do have a feeling though that I will end up taking this game back and exchanging it for something else because of all the durability issues I have read about.
5,Great way to have fun with your kids.,"This is a great game in which you can teach kids to have fun and learn to use their memory. When the cards shoot out they can be very surprised 1, 2, or 8. A great family toy. G.N."
1,"S U C K S - Game that never ends, shoots out too many cards!","I read somewhere that this is supposed to shoot out 2-8 cards, well every time it shot out cards it was 8 to 12 - EVERY TIME! The first and only game went on for about 2 frekin hours and then we decided to convert the game to normal UNO rules and get rid of the stupid shooter, which finally let someone win. This was a brand new game, just out of the package."
3,Unfortunate errors in English spelling and grammar,I enjoyed this cartoon story of the Buddha's early life -- his story is covered only up to his enlightenment -- but the not infrequent caption errors in English spelling and grammar were distracting.
5,Da BLUES - ALIVE FOR U,"Dis movie is da best!.. Secretly directed by Mike Ditka (Da Bears) and written by Harrey Carrey...dis is Chicago at it's best.Say yer penguin prayers, make a flaming nachoe and look for Second City performance by John Candy, Elwood, Matt Guitar Murphy.Rumor has is that Belushi, Brother Brown aand Ray Charles were doin the smashed potato speed ball."
2,Save your money!,"I absolutely adore the snoogle pillow; I bought mine when I was pregnant (with triplets! I was HUGE!) and the babes are now 2 years old and I still sleep with it! My sweet husband bought me a new cover (the one that comes with the pillow had been through the wash so many times it was looking a bit worn...) and after struggling to get the thing on I decided there had to be a better way. I took it off, bought some nice flannel and a very long zipper and made my own cover (I used the ""new"" cover as a template for the pattern). I should mention that I am not a ""Martha Stewart"" type, but I do know how to work a sewing machine. So my advice is find some nice inexpensive fabric you like, the longest zipper you can find, and make your own cover. Much better!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"AFTER WAITING OVER A MONTH FOR THE ITEM IT'S NOW ""NOT IN STOCK"" AND WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU A REFUND! SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN SNOOGLEING 35 DAYS AGO! RIDICULOUS!"
1,When are Mauve and Navy the same?,"I've tried repeatedly to contact you via email indicated in the review guidelines, but ""an error"" always occurs----that figures, as I was complaining about not getting the mauve snoogle covers and receiving navy covers--TWICE. Because I ran out of time, I had to give them to the young lady, who ended up throwing them away before she knew that I would try to send them back one more time and get a return. Your poor customer service left the young lady without a gift and me out the $."
3,Doesn't wash and wear well,"I love this pillow cover, especially because the color is impossible to get in Canada. My only problem is that after the initial wash and first use, the material started to pill. I've tried everything and can't seem to get the pilling under control. It still beats having to use the old pillow cover that came with the snoogle in the first place."
1,The best pregnancy workout I've ever had!,"Cripes!!! This thing is impossible to put on. It took me 25 aggravating minutes to put this cover on and by the time I was done, I was sweating and the Snoogle had been all over the floor! Forget decor and class, just use the pillow without the overpriced, hard to use cover!"
5,awesome pillow!,"This is a must-have for every pregnant woman! Helps keep you on your side, and really helps with those sleepless nights. I would have preferred a zip-around pillow case...the pillow cases are a bit difficult to put on. Other than that, it's great."
4,Leachco Snoogle Pillow Cover Color: Navy,"What can I say, it is a pillow cover. It seems to be of good quality at a good price."
5,it's giving me some of the best nights of sleep during my pregnancy,it really worked! It's given me some of the best nights of sleep during my pregnancy!! I'm so happy that my husband got it for me!
5,Great Game,This game was a great xmas gift for my 6yr old! its fun and easy to understand. Great price and good quality.
1,Cheaply made,"The first game to arrive had to be sent straight back as there was only two top pieces to the barrel, marbles would not be able to fall out of the bottom. We should have looked more closely at the construction before getting the replacement. The second game to arrive contained the correct barrel pieces, however, the plastic straws were so thin that they would readily fall out of the holes while setting up the game. We did not manage to play one game, the set went straight back in the box and another return-for-refund was requested.Full marks to Amazon for the simple and effective returns process though."
5,Easy entertainment to bring children and adults together,"With grandchildren visiting we always strugge to find games that are easy to set up and will keep the young ones entertained without boring the adults. There is enough positive anticipation and noise as the game progresses to accomplish both and it is inexpensive.The rating is for over 3 years, but the sticks are pointed and children really need to be supervised when playing."
3,"Still fun, but surprisingly poor quality","I loved Kerplunk as a kid, and now my own kids do too. Lots of laughs.However, the quality of the parts are now very poor, particularly the sticks, which warp easily."
2,Disappointed,"When I got Kerplunk home and opened the box, I was dumbfounded. The game was this little plastic thing made from cheap materials. As a kid, we had Kerplunk and it was much taller and wider. It was made of a heavier plastic, too. You could be extra careful when you removed the straws because the whole thing was solid and wouldn't budge. The new one is so little, you have to hold it with one hand while you pull the straw, making it difficult to move carefully. I think this is the same type of problem parents are having with retro games. The toy manufacturers know the parent will say, ""I had this game when I was a kid, so I'll buy it for my kid!"" Unfortunately, the new versions are smaller, cheaper and more fragile. If the original version of a game is what is desired, then a parent will have to buy an old game from Ebay. This is actually a cool game, just not the new version."
5,This is supposed to be a smaller version of the original!,"This is supposed to be a smaller version of the original game - for those who want the original try ""Super Kerplunk Game"" not much difference - just more durable. This particular game takes a little time to set up - count that as part of the game - delegate - first person puts in the first 10 sticks etc. etc. I LOVE THIS GAME."
2,Cheap and flimsy...not the game I remembered. Disappointed!,"It's too bad, there are so many great, classic games that I remember playing as a kid, BUT the manufacturers have RUINED them make making them cheap and flimsy. This toy used to be made out of hard plastic and was very sturdy. THIS version however is so flimsy making it near impossible to even play. The sticks are flexible and are impossible to fit through the holes, they bend and break, and then you can't use them, so what's the point? Played just a handful of times before it was unusable. Such a shame!"
2,Not worth the money,"This was another toy I remember playing as a kid. I don't think this game was made very well. When you try putting the sticks in, they slide back out. Plus when it is your turn your suppose to turn the tower, it falls over and tried to break apart. I would not recommend this toy to anyone it is made very cheap."
3,"Good game, Bad Box","If you are planning on buying this as a gift, think twice. The game was shipped to me super fast, as always thank you amazon, and the shipping box was great, but the games box was basically smashed to bits. It was all bent, the lid was torn and bent so bad they actually packing taped the boxed closed on all the edges. Inside the game looked new, but that box was terrible. I wasn't bothered enough to return it since it is for my kids and they will ruin the box soon enough anyway I'm sure...But I would have liked for something advertized as ""brand new"" to have come in store-shelf like quality. If I were giving it as a gift i would have been horrified. It looks like someone pulled it out of their closet from 5 years ago. Game is good fun for the kids though."
1,"piece of crap, Ker Plunk is the right name for it.","wow... this game is a shadow of its former self..The manufacture has cut every corner possible, thin straws, smaller overall hight, very lightweight plastic, (you have to hold it with your hand when pulling a straw so it will not topple over)..This thing is so cheaply made it is depressing!!! Its one of those items that makes you question everything. Who the hell made this? What genius revised the game to its current state and thought it was a great idea? Someone should fire that guy! How much did they spend to make this piece of crap ? 1$ ? 2$? The had to have spent way more on the packaging! What happened to america?also,The game back in the day already had to overcome that horrible name. A name that sounds like something going into a toilet after a big bowl of brand cereal.now , after playing the new version of Ker Plunk, I find the morning toilet bound version more hefty and better built!"
3,Takes imet to set up,"Takes time to set up for short play duration. If you do not mind the set up time, the game is fun for the children."
2,"Great game, super cheap new parts!","This is a great classic game that I personally loved as a child. We had to buy a new one when my sister got older because we loved it so much and had lost too many pieces. I was so excited to get this for my daughter and so disappointed at how cheap it is now made. I would have gladly paid a bit more for better parts. The sticks are now so thin and flimsy that two can fit two in one hole, and if not they are constantly sliding out the other side making this game hard to play when sticks just slide out as you turn it. Also the old tube was one sturdy piece when put together. This version barely stays together for the game! The parts are so terrible but my daughter loves it so much that I plan to buy honey bee tree and try that one instead. Same game concept and much nicer sturdier parts! A vintage Kerplunk would be great too! If it was more sturdy this would be a 5 star game in my book!"
5,Fun Game for All Ages,"Both of my grandsons like this game. They are 9 and 3. Does take a little time to set up, so we don't play as often as they'd like, but it's a treat when we do. Easy to play. And age doesn't give you an advantage. Guess that's why they love it."
4,We Love it!!!!,My 5 year old thinks this game is Awesome!!!! She plays it over and over again!!! :) Our only complaint is it takes a long time to setup after you pull out all the sticks!!! :)
4,Great Family Game,We got this game for something new to do with the family after Thanksgiving Dinner. This is a great game if you are looking for something that just about any age can play. The only limitation is that only 4 can play at a time. We overcame this by playing teams.
2,poor quality all around,i agree with the above review - even the box it's stored in is cheap and flimsy. pieces from game fall out anytime you move the box. not impressed. the game doesn't even hold together.
2,Great game but CHEAP CONSTRUCTION,"Isn't there a better version of this game available? LOVE this game, but the thing is made of such thin, lightweight plastic that we all get frustrated trying to insert the sticks which just slip right through and the whole thing topples over unless someone holds the game upright the WHOLE game. It's the kind of junk you'd expect from a cheap kids meal or something... the only thing real and sturdy about this game is the marbles. My daughter loves this game, but I really hope we can return it and get a stronger one. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is that we love the game."
3,"Flimsy construction, takes a long time to setup","I didn't have any problems with the pieces snapping together, but was disappointed when the sticks would slip out. You can't put big angles in the sticks until you get quite a few pieces already in that are flat. Otherwise they will slip out, and cause frustration. It's also very loose fitting to the base and flops around. It also takes about 5 minutes to set the game up between rounds.It's an OK game though for play, each game lasts at most a few minutes, and in my experience someone is going to ""lose"" very quickly, that is, you'll take out a stick and 20 marbles will fall.It's fun for about 20 minutes, just don't expect hours of play out of this one."
1,A Total Shame of a Game,I'm shocked that anyone would give this game ANY stars. It's so cheaply made and poorly designed as to be basically a throw-away. It's so flimsy that you have to carefully hold the top when pulling out a straw. If someone pulls the wrong straw and the marbles come out it will usually jam...every time in fact. The only fix is to use very few marbles. You'll spend more time threading the straws than actually playing and no attempt has been made to make the tower stable. It's just amazingly cheap and you'd be better served by playing with the box. Mattel should really be ashamed of themselves for taking such a simple concept and turning into what is little more than a pocket-picking scam. Any McDonald's Happy Meal toy is of higher quality. ZERO stars.Capt RB
2,Not the Ker Plunk you remember,The manufacturer's current production of this classic game is a disappointment. The game is much smaller than when I played it as a kid 35+ years ago. Worst of all the sticks are very thin and flexible so that they can run into holes other than the one directly opposite and do not support the marbles in later stages of the game. The tray is too small to hold all the marbles as they run out. The manufacturer has saved a few pennies of production cost but turned it into a toy that isn't worth buying.
2,Buy a vintage version instead,"I misplaced a version I purchased several years ago. Today's model is ultra-cheap.The sticks are too thin and slick, often sliding out of the holes on their own. This makes setup a pain. As a child I used to enjoy placing the sticks in various alignments. Now, unless the sticks are horizontal, they will slide out.The module rocks in the holder, easily causing marbles to drop as you change turns. This makes gameplay annoying for children who are not ultra delicate in their handling of the game.Instead of buying this cheap version I would suggest shopping for a vintage model."
2,Poor rendition of a classic game,"This is a redesigned version of the game. Its still fun to play, however the materials and design of the game are exceptionally poor. The thin plastic sticks (used to be wood) bend easily and are rather difficult to slide through the holes during set-up...making set-up take almost as long as the game itself. Additionally, the cylinder doesn't fit into the base, making the entire game unstable...someone basically has to hold the cylinder during each turn or it will fall. Its probably a better idea to find a vintage version."
2,Difficult to Set Up,"This game is very difficult to set up to even play it. You have to put all the sticks in the holes and they slide out a lot and you have to start over. If you can get it set up, it is a fun game, but there is a big if there."
5,Heart Touching,This book brought out many feelings. It went from my days in the hood to my friends who'd been using drugs and those who'd been physically or sexually abused. Like all of the books I've read by Lee Charles. The all dialogue/play-like concept held my attention and just like the other books it showed me ways to talk about many personal subjects that are sometimes hard to discuss.
3,Ugly Pleasures,"Lee Charles wrote about a subject that most authors shy away from. The ugly Side of Pleasure is a book that exposes the truth about the unspoken, sexual abuse, that frequently occur in some families. With the use of her characters, Lee Charles gets to the heart of the matter of the types of abuse that, in our shame, we try to keep hidden. But with exposure, we can come to terms with the truth, and maybe prevent other young women from suffering the same fate. Good luck to you in your future endeavors."
5,Why did it take so long?,Kitchen shears with a wall mount. No one could dream this up before this? Say Good-Bye to searching through that junk drawer.And my husband even remembers to put them back in place..
5,Love it.,"I really enjoyed reading Baaa it's funny yet a little disturbing. It's pretty cool, and I think it's the best picturebook, since I'm a little too old for picture books."
4,Soylent Green for children,"""Baaa"" is the story of an overpopulated world of sheep facing a food shortage. Each time the sheep riot, many are killed and a mystrious food called ""Baaa"" becomes available.Twisted in a fun way."
5,Love this reamer!,"I don't know how I lived without this reamer! It gets every last drop of juice from a citrus fruit. I use the green side for limes and small lemons. The yellow side is of course for lemons, but is also good for oranges. One slight down-side is that you have to pick the seeds out of the juice. I ream the juice into a small bowl first and then it's easy to retrieve the seeds."
1,"trite, self-engrandizing, egotistical, narcissistic, pulp","I was very disappointed by this self-indulgent, self-engrandizing piece of pulp. Mr. Ferry obviously wrote this as an antidote to his insecurity and it expresses a poor attempt at both self-examination and historical analysis. This product is an insult to the reader's intelligence; a grand waste of time to read. I don't think the Anglican church got rid of Mr. Ferry for the reasons he would have us believe. I think it was his apparent obstinacy, and inability to subject himself to the authority of the church! There are many gay priests in the Anglican church who have not left their lovers (of which the church is aware). Mr. Ferry was obviously looking to grand stand at the time, and to create a name for himself! This is a sad testament and not worthy of a major motion picture.I for one was not interested in his vanity, misrepresentations, half-truths, and rantings."
2,AC/DC Battery Charger From Dekcell,"Shortly after ordering this product I had Surgery on my shoulders and am typing with great pain. I was up set that the charger was sent with the wrong adapter plat it wont charge my older batterys nor will it charge the 2 batteries I recently purchased from the same company. The adapter plat should have 3 pop up contacts, + t - so if they want any mor of my buisness maybe they could send me the correct one as I gave them the # from my AC charger as well as my batteries."
1,Step By Step for Microsoft Front Page 2002,Many of the practice files contained in this book and it's companion CD ROM do not match. I found it very disturbing to work in. I shall return the book for refund. This Combo does not deserve a star at all.
1,poor book,"I agree with the reviewer who found this book confusing because there are errors in the instructions.Trying to use this book was extremely frustrating, and I finally gave up trying. Possibly Microsoft had the writers put it together using a beta version and then never had anyone edit it after the retail version was released.From now on, I'm going to try books first in the library before buying them. Interestingly, Step by Step for Excel 2000 is a good book.Best luck to everyone in learningFrontPage 2002,C. Smart"
3,"How To Plate, Polish, and Chrome","My main reason for acquiring the book was to learn how to polish my frame on my motorcycle. The book, however helpful, spent a great deal of the print dealing with painting. It was helpful to me in getting some the equipment for polishing but it it should have went more in depth and since it's title is ""How To Plate, Polish, and Chrome"" it should have a more step-by-step approach to polishing, plating and chroming."
2,a good read,This book is informative and interesting and covers a vast range of topics. Far more indepth and worthwhile than I had expected. A definate good book to have on the shelf.
3,Talk About a Wrong Title!,"If ever there was a wrong title for a book, this is it. Yes there was some information in the book about plating and polishing chrome and, surprisingly enough, it was good, useful information. That said though, the actual contents of the book were all over the map. There was a LOT of information about painting and powder coating, things not even mentioned in the title. That coverage was quite thorough and very, very useful.I think the title was contrived to grab the attention of the broadest spectrum of potential users rather than identify the actual contents of the book. I'm usually impressed by the Motorsports Series of books and while I am impressed by the contents of this book, I'm not impressed by the title of this particular book."
4,Wannabe-vet loves this box!,"Got this as a gift for my 10-year old cousin, who recently got a kitten. Apparently it is the hit of the holiday--family says she's hardly EVER this quiet! I haven't seen it in action yet, so can't speak to the quality of the contents, but it is definitely a good gift for a child who is old enough to understand and who can play unsupervised."
1,Disappointing,"Would not call it a ""Science"" kit at all. Included plastic bowls, catnip and plastic hoop that didn't even connect so how could your cat jump thru that???? No treats included - waste of money & stupid!"
4,The Flight from Truth,"Just started the book. Especially appreciate it because of the non-American perspective. Also, the relevance of media influence on public opinion, particularly, the spotlight on the deceit that misleads the gullible people who trust ""talking heads"" with hidden agendas. We need to develop a healthy skepticism of self-proclaimed experts who close their eyes to everything that doesn't fit their politically correct ideology. Any book that keys us to the practices that mislead us is worth our time. There is too much at stake for us to ignore the beguiling voices that conceal the truth about the evil in our world."
5,"Custom Hood Protector, Black","This item was a perfect fit for my car and it looks great. No problems during washing or weather, it wears well."
3,Not a bad cd,"this cd is okay, i heard better gospel music. but it wasn't bad. it was very enjoyable. the best song on this cd is Ride Of Life.If you liked this cd then check out all of 4Him's cds."
5,Perfect litterbox for an old cat,"I've got an old arthritic cat that no longer could climb into a regular litter box, so I was looking for something wide and low and smooth on the bottom (no ribs) to make scooping litter easy, and this works perfectly. It's a little flimsy like other people have mentioned, but for my purposes it doesn't matter."
3,Thin Material. Easily Cracked. Save Your Money,You get what you pay for. Cheap thin plastic pan. I ended up cracking the edge when I lifted the washing machine into the pan. It doesn't come with a floor drain. I ended up purchasing a heavy duty composite pan at the local plumbing supply house for $45. This pan would work (be super careful when dropping the washer in) and I have seen them installed in homes/apartments. I would save your money for something a little more durable.
4,Smaller than expected,"We bought this as we were moving into a new home where the laundry room did not have a floor drain. It works as expected but I could have sworn that it said it was 7"" deep. It is only about 3"" deep. It is also hard to get the washer leveled since the pan is just a couple inches bigger than the washer itself, making it hard to get to the leveler feet without tipping the washer back quite a ways. But the price was very good and delivery was on time."
5,Old Guy,"The ""pan"" arrived quickly, it is strong enuf, but dont set your washer down on it. (the edge) nice bright white, I like it."
3,product infomation needed: size,"I did not get this item yet!Amazon list a inconsistent size for this pan:Product SpecificationsPart Number 34051Item DimensionsLength 32.50 inches Width33 inches Height7 inchesProduct FeaturesOatey 28X30 Washing Machine Pan 34051OATEY SCS, INC.I check the Oatey's website the 34051 is 28x30. The reason I concern so much about the size is I need a small pan the the regular 32x30 pan which is available everywhere.Hopefully they will ship one with right size."
4,Diann-Washington,The product is a little lighter weight than I thougt it would be but does the job(will save my new wood floor from any leaks or overflow)Took quite a while to ship but I was told that when I ordered it. So I would recomend it to others.
4,Congrats to Simon Fuller for topping the Spice Girls.,Congrats to Simon Fuller for topping the Spice Girls with his latest find S Club 7. Four girls and three guys round the gender mix vocals on the first single from this sure to be hit.
1,S Club Woo What?,"S club yuck! If this is all Britain's got then trust me the rest of the world doesn't need it. The group doesn't suck, as a matter of fact they've got some talent, but they need some better producing. The only thing catchy about this tune is the chorous. Their music sounds like something the Spice Girls would do (coincidentally 3 gal members remind you of spice girl doubles...it's like traveling back in time). i don't know, maybe the US isn't ready for British pop (think of Geri, Billie, Robbie). They've done well @ home, but they sure do have to prove they're more than just a fabricated British singing group who'll break up on their world tour after doing a film two years from now."
3,cheesy pop,"This is teen-pop reminiscent of ""The Party"" (anyone remember them??). Nothing new here, just jumpin' on the bandwagon. A remix by K-Klass helps a bit, making it a poppy/house number, but nothing spectacular."
5,Get with the S Club!,"What can I say! This debut single from the undoubtedly talented S Club 7 is simply wonderful! Unlike the majority of British pop music, 'Bring it all back' fails to become even remotely annoying, even if you play it a hundred times! Perhaps surprisingly, the lyrics are in fact very meaningful, laden with encouragement and assurance for all the listeners. This combined with the it's catchy melody, clever harmonies and textural accomaniments gives the song an undoubtedly winning formula!"
5,This Is Worth The $4,"This single isn't the best you'll ever hear, but it does have a great song... Bring It All Back. It also has Bring It All Back K-Klass Mix, which is very good.Bring It All Back is an up-beat, feel good song. All of S Club 7 have great voices and give it a nice twist. I would recommend listening to it. Check out S Club 7's album S Club on Amazon, and you can hear a 30 second clip of the song.Bring It All Back K-Klass Mix is not the best, but it's good enough for your money. It's about 6 minutes long, and the melody they have sounds great with the vocals!It's worth the $4 you could spend on it. There's no fancy slip cover, or art work, but the music gives you a smile for sure.You can also find this song on S Club 7's album 'S Club', which I recommend if you like this song!"
1,SHALLOW,"you stupid teeniboppers, s club 7 is a media hoax set up by some big record company to make cash. The lyrics and tunes subliminaly stick in your head, making you want to buy it, and instead of using the real singers they employ attractive models to appear in concerts and in videos to lip sync, remember milli vanilli anyone?"
4,A Must Read,"I have ra and searched for anything that could help me. I came across Barbara's book it has helped me out so much. It has a wealth of information its a must read. The program works, you need to have disipline if you work it, it will work for you. It's not easy but if you want to get control of your life back please read her book."
4,Using The Book,Book was very organized and as a result was clear. The format of explanation and then giving a plan of action was excellent. The only thing it needed to be a 5 Star was a little more humor.
5,Great book,"A huge amount of research - both scientific and personal - has gone into this book. It is a document of pain, determination and success. It is also a roadmap for those who want to learn how to take better care of themselves for any reason. It is just full of information, methods and ideas. The author is intelligent, well-educated and persevering, and she uses those tools to sort through the flood of information and mis-information about arthritis and health in general, and then to present those she found most useful with step-by-step how-to's. It's a great book."
5,Lives up to its title!,"This book is a comprehensive,exhaustively researched,beautifully organized,detailed, and clear presentation of a remarkable journey. The photo on the cover of the book says it all. And though Ms. Allan focuses on arthritis, she also gives information and practical techniques that help her readers cope with other illnesses. Her knowlegable and clear presentations of how the body works and what it does with the food ingested is culled both from personal experience and a scientifically trained mind; her years of research and writing were a product of necessity, determination, discipline and scientific rigor. She inspires and teaches us to find approaches that work. By trial and error, patience and self-observation, with the hard-won information she provides, we can heal ourselves.The book is invaluable. To understate: In it are lists naming hidden allergens in the foods we buy--these lists alone are worth the price of the book!"
5,A Masterpiece,"Barbara's personal and passionate committment to understanding herself and her illness and the rich personal exploration she undertook is a living example to the potency we each contain to healing in a personal way. Her book safely opens many avenues of healthy practices to explore in our search for deeper health and wholeness. This book is a masterpiece.Jocelyne Leyton, R.P.P."
3,The Type of Arthritis the Author Has Should Be Revealed!,"I think this is a good book, but unfortunately, the author's type of arthritis (allergic) is not related to rheumatoid arthritis, which is what my husband has. So, basically, I wasted my money on a book we cannot use."
2,Not for Everyone,"Maybe i'm being shortshighted, but i feel as if the many concessions i already have to make with this disease are hard enough to incorporate into my daily life, without also including such intense dietary changes. I work full-time, including travel and client entertainment making it very difficult to always control every morsel i consume. also, don't share the author's background and early diagnosis symptoms. Mine are coming more slowly and i am entrusting my treatment and long-term care to my Rheumy. Sort of wish I had spent the money on a good yoga or meditation tape instead."
5,Have Arthritis- Don't take no for an answer,As Barbara Allan's father I am extremely proud of her book.She was extremely sick for many years and when she could not find help from the medical profession SHE WOULD NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. She set out on her own to find a way back to good health. For years I watched her suffer extreme pain. During this time she was constantly doing research and learning by trial and error the information she has put in her book. It is well written and easy to follow but takes will power to get results. The results should be a lifesaver for those with arthritis or food allergies.
5,Excellent tips for better health all around.,"Even if you dont have arthritis this book will help you become more healthy, but the authors account of her victory over arthritis is amazing. I know her personally and she is a accomplished person and author, I recommend this book without any reservations."
5,I love this series,"These books are written very well. I have read this series over again several times. For me, the characters seem to teach that though life has many inherent hardships, if you make wise Biblical choices, God will be on your side and help you through. For that reason, these books are great at encouraging the reader."
1,incredibly cliche,"I really disliked this book. It's a fairly cliche story, and the characters have nothing particularily special about them. Pretty much, it's about the ""perfect christian family"" that manages to, through goodness, help make a nasty environment better. The characters are all saccharine and have no distinct personality, except for being perfect and good and unselfish. They run into all sorts of people who seem like bad people, but the family helps them anyways, and of course it all works out. An extremely predictable book with nothing special about it. It seems like stephen bly is just churning out novel after novel without really making any one novel distinct."
5,best death metal,"This has got to be a masterpiece in melodic death metal. Arch enemy is pure talent. When i first heard 'ravenous' 'burning angel' and 'enemy within' i couldn't get enough of them.. Then I ordered their album and they are amazing.. Their guitaring blended in with their vocals makes an excellent sound that no other death band could produce, not to mention the great melody the music possesses. IF you like melodic death metal and you haven't heard this, i recommend you do so."
3,"Good, but not Arch Enemy's best.","For their best, delve into either ""Stigmata"" or ""Burning Bridges."" The tracks on ""Wages of Sin"" aren't nearly as diverse or interesting as on the aforementioned albums. The Ammot brothers still shred on guitar, but the new vocalist, Angela Gassow, doesn't offer much in terms of versatility. She can scream and growl with the best of them, but that isn't enough to keep someone captivated for an entire album. Some bands can get away with using similar song structures and monotonous vocals. This one can't. Still a fine CD, but they can do better. Why? Because this band's talents are limitless."
3,3.5 Out 5,"A decent follow-up to the excellent Burning Bridges release. Arch Enemy have another vocalist. With new vocalist Angela Gossgow the band has some of the most brutal female vocals heard. She has her own unique style and I personally like it better than say Rachael from Sinister. The 2nd CD is much better than the first disc(Rare And Unreleased)and Wages Of Sin has its moments but can't compare to Burning Bridges,the last CD. The songs aren't as memorable and lack depth on the 1st disc,not that they bad or anything,the Amott brothers always have great musicianship,I just think it will take maybe to the next release to have Angela fit more with music and band as a whole."
3,"Hey, it's pretty funny!","I gave this cd a few spins.The music is top notch.They do death metal good.But that's about it.Nothing new about this band.Everything from the solo to the beats, fills and vocals are very stereotypical.And, kinda funny too. Hearing the guitarists hit harmonics while making guitar faces in the video are hilarious.So is the singer posing like a bat or something. She can do diaphramic breathing, but she still as far as registers and variation go.I also have to mention that the only feeling of soul I get from listening to these guys are the guitarists.So, it's average at best."
1,ANGELA!!,everything is perfect except ANGELA whats up with this death metal crap cant you guys sing normally jeez!
3,Hm ...,"I don't know, I would actually have to give this CD a seven out of ten ... but since I only have five stars, I gave it a three. This CD seemed a lot more enjoyable the first few times I listened to it. Now when I listen to it, it's not catchy, it seems more bland and I tend to skip songs, which I am not in the habit of doing. Mike's guitar work is one of the only things that really keeps my attention ... it is fantastic, this is why he is famous. But over all, I'd rather listen to something with more personallity to it, to a degree this is actually a commercial CD. Nothing really (besides the guitar leads) sticks out as being super.I've also heard Black Earth by them, and I don't know if this band is over rated, or this CD ... I really do think this CD is over rated. If you are looking for a CD by them, I'd have to recommend an earlier release, or if you are just looking for Swedish metal, I'd go with, In Flames, The Haunted, or Dark Tranquility ... but I don't recommend this one very much."
5,Who needs a woman? You've got Arch Enemy!,"I knew this album would rock. Why? It was ARCH ENEMY. My friend turned me on to them one day after we were talking and I asked him what ever happened to CARCASS. He popped it in the disc man and I was hooked. Ever since I have slowly purchased their albums. I heard the release of their newest album and I was not willing to wait for it to come out here! I purchased it like within two days. It was worth the cash because I put it in my CD player... and had goosebumps from begining to end. It's aranged with a non-stop barrage of harmonies that you'd expect from them. The female singer... well I was a bit apprehensive about it, but.. Angela if your reading this... WILL YOU BE MY WIFE? Heh Well.. why are you still reading this? Place an order!"
2,I lost respect.....,"To start off, I prefer Johan over Angela. I think that you dont have to have ""Brutal"" vocals to make metal. Overall I think her presence is also very melodramtic(For that one video from this album). I also read in Revolver that they booted Johan because he was ""in the background"" (They wanted a more pretty person to get more publicity(they even said he was ""ugly"")). Well, I think the musics good, but somethings missing..... Like Johan"
5,Excellent CD and Band That Deserves More Attention,"This CD is amazing, However Anthems of Rebellion is just a hair better. I love the two disc music thing, instead of the DVD you get with Anthems of Rebellion. I like the remakes of Aces High and Starbreaker. Judas Priest and Iron Maiden would be pleased. This band is amazing, and deserves more attention then they get. I wish the radio stations played them, they are a kick ass REAL metal band. All songs are good but they just don't stand out as much as the songs on Anthems of Rebellion."
3,Great Family Card Game,This is a great card game for families. My wife & I have also had a good time playing this with other adults as well. I can't wait for my older children to play it as it is easy to learn. Well worth it & inexpensive to boot. Definitely a must have for any game closet.
1,I Know We're in the minority,"We love games at our house. All kinds of games. But 6 of us here, kids to adults, think this game is dumb. We play Pitch, which is card game with tricks and bidding, Cribbage, Five Crowns, Killer Bunnies, Munchkins, Bananagrams, Labyrinth and Chess...to give you an idea of the kinds of games that we love and play as much as possible. We love games that increase brain power.My mom loves Uno and so do my kids, but they also did not like Skip Bo. It reminds me very much of Uno, which is not a game I enjoy. It's like a dumb variation of Uno. We thought the game would never end. Tried it twice, sent to goodwill.I highly recommend Five Crowns over this game. It can be played with kids as young as kindergarten to adult and much more fun and clever."
5,Must Have Card Game,This is my favorite card game. Love the fact that you can make the game go fast or slow depending on how many cards you start with. My 7 year old's love this game as it's very easy to play since you only need to know how to count to 12. It's great with a group of people to play. This is another game that I like to give at birthday parties. It's a great game to have in your collection. If you don't understand the instructions to this game just search on youtube and they have some great tutorials on how to play it. That's what sold me the game.
4,Fun for young number lovers,"My 5 yo twins (boy/girl) received this game recently and even though it says the game is for 7+, they got the hang of it really fast. This is a great game for young kids to work on their numbers and think ahead about how they can make a sequence of numbers based on the cards they have and what they might get. They love playing this game, however, my daughter tends to tire of it faster as it does drag a little. The best way to play is to only deal 10 cards to each person for their stockpile. My son, however, loves numbers and is obsessed with this game. He loves playing it for as long as possible and insists we do 30 cards in the stockpile every time. After one day he was already working against me, looking at the cards I have and holding onto his cards which he thought would help me make a sequence and use up my stockpile. I personally would not choose to play this gave often as I think it's slow and boring. But my kids seem to enjoy it, especially my number loving son."
4,Fun GAME,"Its a fun game to have for parties and family gatherings, keeps your mind and brain working. my sisters love it"
1,This is the worst game and most unclear directions EVER,"I purchased SKIP Bo and would like very much to get my money back. The directions are terrible; three well educated and card savvy adults couldn't understand the directions. We quit the game, never to return unless someone can write decent directions."
1,no fun at all,"My boys LOVE to play uno and I thought this would be a new fun card game. We tried playing it several times. It is very confusing, the directions are really hard to understand, and not fun at all! I actually took it back to the store because we never wanted to play it again. Not sure why everyone loves this one so much."
1,Skip-Bo is good for young children to learn and play,"Skip-Bo is good for young children to learn and play.Very boring for adults.Requires minimal intelligence, mostly pure luck, almost zero stratigy.Long and excruciatingly boring lacking zero mental skills."
4,Fun card game,"I live in a Senior Apartment facility and we love this game. My only problem with this card set (my 3rd purchase) is that after using it at least 3 times a week, after about 6 months, the cards stick together - making it hard to deal correctly. I have not been able to find a way to solve this problem even after Googling it."
4,Excellent for adults,"It's a type of game that even dough is for children, we as adults enjoy more than them. Four players is what i recommend for this toy. So if you plan to have fun with your friends put this on the bag."
4,Great for Kids and Adults!,"I used to play this game with my grandmother years ago, so when my five year-old started growing out of her kid games (i.e. Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, etc.), I picked this up with some others. She really enjoys playing it, and has even won a round a few times. She really gets in to the strategic aspects of playing, and even taunts other players when they set her up to play cards from her ""stockpile."" The counting aspects are easy for her to pick up, and the use of the discard piles helps her understand how to make choices that will help/hurt her chances for winning in a much better way than a game like Uno might.Durability is what you would expect from a card game. They won't last forever, especially when playing with kids. But, you will have a lot of fun with this one when playing with your kids (or even other adults)!"
5,Science Funk Jam Monumental,"(sound tribe)Sector 9 is the best jam band that I came up to in recent light years.They have this kind of space travel journeys through the musical expression.I don't agree that repetition is their mark,yet unexpected changes might be.Once they hook you up to one rhythm and melody thing,they turn you on with a superb change that floats into another direction,but perfectly fit to what they were doing before.Very important thing is to say that if you haven't heard them live,then you can't judge at all.Their live recordings(although even albums are live too!) are like feeling of love all the time.This album is their first studio work and it is amasing,as they twisted the funk all around.My favourite is Hubble because that song really evoke acid trip on space travel.Other songs are great too,and all of them are total hits.Try them if you dare to explore."
2,Needs Tightness,"I'm a fan of the jambands and I really enjoy electronic music. I heard these guys were really influential so I bought this album. Most of the songs drag along on one riff and it gets really repetitive, especially when the drum fills don't come in right. That happens way too much on track one. ""Four Year Puma"" grabbed me because of some interesting bass playing but one good track is not enough, It doesn't sound to me like there was a lot of time put into this. There are electronic bands out there that use a main riff as the theme of a song but it sounds really good, they put more sounds into their music and the rhythym is tight. This rhythym on this album is loose, the person who said that it sounds ""mushy"" I think is right on. A lot of times it sounds like everyone is playing over each other. Try music from Tortoise or Slide Five."
3,Poor quality anatomical photos,"Besides the fact that none of the ARRT MR Registry review books (NOT published by the ARRT!) seem to be up-to-date, I mean, if you're going to charge $45 for this book and keep it in print is it too much to ask to review and rewrite it every few years? The questions and answers, ACR & FDA mandates have changed considerably since 2004.My main gripe is with the way-too-dark/high contrast anatomical images that ask: ""What is arrow #2 pointing at?"" Beats me! I can't even SEE arrow #2 OR the anatomy, I know its a Lumbar spine, I thing you are referring to the spinal cord. This is just terrible and very frustrating."
3,Good but needs to be updated.,This is a good (not great) reference for registry prep. It provides numerous sample registry questions along with the answers and rationale for each. While the information presented is accurate it needs to be updated to reflect current practice. Some of the explantions could be more straight-forward and less convoluted.
2,substandard,"The pictures in this book are unnacceptable. It's hard enough to distinguish MRI's that have good resolution, but these are completely garbage. And I have found at least 20 questions that are completely wrong. The book is outdated but some of the questions are helpful for studying. I'm just using this as extra studying material. The MIC and MRI in practice are much more accurate and helpful tools. This is not worth the money I spent!"
3,review,"This book has lots of helpful questions, however, it seems to be a bit dated as of today, 2004. For example, it states that the body coil is the best coil to use in imaging the pelvis vs. a surface coil. No one I talked to, and I talked to many with much more experience than I , could find the reasoning behind that."
4,Good Review,"This book has a great questions that I did not learn in the MRI in practice book. The questions are on the difficult side, which has it's good and bad points. On one hand, it is great if you can answer the questions correctly, you will probably pass your boards. On the other hand, unless you have successfully passed a MRI course or read the MRI in practice book, this review book may be difficult to extract information from. The book does give detailed answers in the back of the book, includes two practice tests, and has the questions divided into sections like the board exams. All in all, I would buy the book and would recommend the book. I hope this helps. Good luck to everyone taking the boards."
3,"Questions good, Pictures not so much","This book had great questions except for the anatomy part. You could not make out any of the anatomy on the poorly published pictures. I had to skip over all those questions. I don't know if it was only my book with such poor pictures or if they are all like that, but at the price they charge for this book, I think we should get full use of it."
3,Not That Hot,"I have to disagree with most of these reviews. I bought this book a while back to study for the registry exam and although it did help, there were too many typos for me to really trust the info in it. I'm sure Mr. Wheeler's seminars are great, but the editor of his book should have double checked the information and math calculations before publishing this book."
1,look elsewhere,"don't waste your time or money on this book. Extremely outdated, wrong answers on many questions, unable to see pictures clearly. this book should be pulled off of the market. MIC publishes an up to date 12 module review program that sets the standard for the MRI registry. Spend the extra money on that."
5,Alex Henshaw,Alex Henshaw was one of the world's great pilots. This describes his pre WW2 life as a racing pilot. Good reading for pilots.
4,Interesting,"I found this mystery interesting, but not 5-star. I enjoyed the characters and the setting very much, and liked the past and present woven together. But there's something about Indridason's endings that leaves me wanting more -- more what, I don't know, but I don't find the endings totally satisfying. Still, I like the series and so far have kept reading the titles."
5,First-rate police procedural.,"I was looking around for a crime novel to read, and I noticed this one available on Kindle for just $2,99. THe reviews were good, so I thought I'd give it a try. I don't want to be specific about the novel because I always worry about giving information away. I just wanted to add my voice to the many who have praised this brilliantly-constructed book. Just a word of warning, and that's that the book is grim, exceedingly grim. But it's a great read. Get it while it's so reasonably priced."
5,"Intelligent and profound book, excellent reading","This is the second book by A. Indridasson, which I have read. it is also the second in his Reykjavik Murder Mysteries series. The book is excellent. I enjoyed it from the very first page to the last. it is not just a police story, but a profound, intelligent writing with its slow, but exciting narrative and a deep insight into the subject, which happens to be a physiology of a domestic violence. It is brilliantly written, it's characters are incredibly realistic and the ending is elegant and optimistic.It is, indeed, the best book, I have read by far. I am now into the fifth book of this series, which I highly recommend for everybody, who likes intelligent and well wrought story."
4,great story but icelandic names are hard,"it is a great story, interesting angles....some learning of early WW11 days in Icelanduntil the end of the book one can speculate on the identity of the skeleton.I am old...and I had problems remembering who was who because the Icelandic names arenot obvious to the sex of the individuals.In my case it was better to read the book quickly without days in between.Hard to feet sorry for any of the characters."
3,Silence of the Grave.,"I was expecting an exciting mystery along the lines of Jo Nesbo or Steig Larson, but Indridason is not of their caliber. I wouldnot share this book with a friend."
5,Graveyard story thriller,What a book! Weaving two stories together for a huge conclusion. Great mystery and characters.
4,Good mystery,"I was introduced to the Icelandic mysteries through a friend. I enjoy Inspector Erlunder and learning about Iceland and its people. I have now read this and Jar City and hope to read more. Not as graphic as the Swedish mysteries, reads more like a BBC mystery series."
4,Silence of the Grave,"Excellent! I was looking for an interesting mystery after reading the three Steig Larsson books. The main character, Detective Erlendur, is quiet, unassuming and has family troubles of his own, but is determined to search the past for answers to today's murder of an old man. Very interesting character development of an unassuming man. Arnaldur Indridason will be an interesting Iceland mystery writer to follow.Stephanie L."
2,Ugliness with no Redeeming Qualities,"Wife and child brutality is a horrible subject. If well presented with some understanding of the situation, a book about that brutality might be worth reading. I found nothing like that in this book. Unremitting cruelty, coupled with detectives with somber overwhelming lives, does not make for pleasant reading. It took me several starts to get by the viciousness. The book finally sort of stumbled to an expected ending. The sidebar characters did nothing to enrich the book. They simply seemed to get in the way. I would have preferred a faster ending so I could put the book behind me.I certainly cannot recommend this book - especially not to any parent."
2,Tedious,"This is a book in which nothing happens; a skeleton is found and the events leading up to the death are told in flashbacks interwoven with another plot in which nothing happens. The first half of the book held my interest through the characters, their situations and the underlying themes but after the that the slow, brooding progress of the story was just painful. I skimmed the second half of the book just to see if it unfolded the way I expected (it did -- highly predictable)."
4,silence of the grave purchased at Amazon,"I enjoyed the book however, it was difficult to keep up with the characters. It could be because the names of the characters were foreign to me. I had to keep backtracking to know who's who. The story got very involved with each characters history. All and all it kept my interest,"
4,Silence of the Grave,Book was well blended with past crime and current day police inspectors. The murder mystery was very good. Who was buried in the makeshift grave?
4,Salence of the grave,Silence of the grave is one of those thrillers that one does not want to end. The author does an excellent job of mixing past and present to get his story across
3,hard to read,Good story but the names of the characters are hard to pronounce so it was hard to relate.Good story in the end!
5,New interesting Islandic writer.,"I love this Icelandic writer have not read anything from her before. The plot is exiting, persons well drawn. It's a sleep stopper."
4,Silence of the Grave,"I real nice follow up to Jar City, a solid story. I am looking forward to the next book in the series."
4,Silence of the Grave,I am enjoying his books so much! And I love learning about Iceland and her people. Great thriller.
1,Cruel book.,I'd prefer to give it NO stars. Anxious to discover a new good writer I got this book. Do not read this author. He knows a lot about cruelty and depravity and is determined to share it with us.
4,Enticing,I could hardly put it down!! Really good book I finished reading it within 3 days. Hmm it kept throwing in twists to the story!! The back flashes were easy to follow.
3,Silence of the grave,"In short, I found the book to be entertaining, but not memorable. The several subplots were each interesting, but failed to come together as a whole and I found the efforts devoted to investigating a grave from the significant past to be somewhat implausible. The book did leave me with a number of unanswered questions about historic Icelandic society that I would like to pursue further."
4,Facinating thriller,"I was thrilled to discover this chilling thriller about Iceland and to discover a new author. I look forward to reading other novels by Arnaldur Indridason and learning more about his many faceted hero, Inspector Erlunder."
4,Silence of the Grave,"Enjoyed learning a little of the history, learning names I have never heard before. Would eventually like to buy the other books by this author that include the same characters from Silence of the Grave."
4,"Intelligent, engaging procedural","I have not read the first in the series, but I was impressed with this second novel. The story was engaging and the writing lovely. The main character is interesting, though enigmatic at this point. It kept me guessing to the end. I enjoy Nordic mysteries, and while this series doesn't approach Mankell for depth and texture (yet) I would recommend it for those who like intelligent detective novels."
2,Maybe others in the series are better,"Readers who are not from and have never visited Iceland yet would like to know more about the country might find this book interesting (as I did) for the information about the country that can be gleaned or deduced from ""Silence of the Grave."" People simply hoping to read a good mystery (or a good novel) will probably not derive much pleasure from this poorly plotted book. Perhaps other books in the series are better, but this one does not prompt me to find out."
2,Badly off tune.,"The sound and construction is acceptable. It would make an okay beginner interment I guess.I bought it to play along with guitar and other flutes and that's impossible because it isn't in tune. The product description calls it D, while the tonic actually falls about 40 cents flat of E, so not only is it not D, its really not anything. By adjusting breath force I can bring it up to around an even E, but by then I'm blowing into it so hard the tone becomes very unpleasant, particularly at octave. It was cheap so I'm keeping it for messing around solo, but to sell me a instrument tuned off by almost 2 semitones is pretty shady."
5,Ocarina Necklace,"We found this Ocarina necklace to be a good value, and my son loved it! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a beginner Ocarina."
5,...,"So, this was my first ever ocarina. When it arrived, I quickly took it out of the box, and proceeded to try it out. It sounded off...too me, I was expecting it to sounds...different. However, since then I have learned that this ocarina sounds like it's suppose to sound. a little on the higher end. Eventually, I was very satisfied with the product, and wore it around everywhere I went. That is until my 2 year old daughter became obsessed with it herself, and ended up dropping it on the hardwood floor. Chances are, yours won't survive that fall either. Fragile. Not a bad thing though. Just not for children. Although, that became obvious the minute you get it."
5,The Must Have Book for Coaches!,This is the must have book for coaching boys sports. You can take the virtues described in Tim's book and transform into team talks. There is a group that advocates this book and has done wonders with sporting teams. [...] and see how they use virtue talks to spark the faith.
4,don't be put off by the lame title!,this book is a fine summary and practical look at the virtues. i highly recommend it for either reading or as a bible study. we are using it as a men's study.
5,Frank Lloyd Wright Gillin House Doormat,This is a great doormat. It has a unique style and seems to be holding up well.
4,Authentic WW2 film....glad I got it...,"I liked the film...An exciting, historically accurate look at the closing days of WW2 from a unique perspective..... I was very impressed by the quality of the uniforms, weapons, tanks etc.... used in the film.... looks at WW2 from a human side, not just portraying the Germans as Nazis, but as soldiers fighting for each other..... an accurate, enjoyable film that is worth a look.... more than anything, I liked the T-34 tank, the Hetzer tank destroyer, and the hand to hand combat...4 stars..."
3,A WWII movie of an old sort,"This movie has a strange joining forces of a British officer and a Germanwho are prisoners of the Russian at the end of WWII.Not the best movie ever but pretty good for what seems like a low budget film.The German uniforms are very strange, but the Russian ones looklikely. The weapon the Captain uses with a round magazinedidn't look like anything I remember the Germans having.The light German tank in the film just ain't so...ha, ha...I doubt any of those tanks exist today?The Russian at this point in the war were using a lot of American weaponsand probably uniforms? So what did Stalin intend at this time?No one knows, but he certainly had ideas several years later."
2,Panzers or T-54s?,Partial review: I just saw the first 20 mins of this and noticed the Germans called the Russian tanks 'panzers.' Is it just me or weren't the German tanks called panthers(panzer) or tigers(tiger) and the Russina tanks called T-54 or T-74(I may be off on the numbers)? It just kind left me a little baffled. It started good though. I'll finish my review once I finish wataching it this weekend. I just had to get that off my chest.
1,Wow.,if you can make it through this movie without fast forwarding then your name should be engraved on a plaque and the president should give you a little pin.
1,Oh Brother...'s War,"What a farce! Hogan's Hero's is more historically accurate, for the love of Pete! What were you guys smoking prior to watching/reviewing this B-movie? My 16 yr old is easy to please when it comes to movies, but even he was pissed that he drove 2 miles to the Cub Foods (Redbox) and wasted $1.99 of his money on this plotless, poorly acted, waste of everyone's time. He said, that he and his buddies could have made a more convincing war movie in the backyard, and I must concur. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY FOLKS!"
2,Good plot potential - but somewhat of a let down.,"At first the movie comes across as having the makings of a gripping story. The makers of the movie tried to capture the aspects of the period associated with the Russian advance through Europe. Also some good attempts at avoiding the dumbing down of the combatants as presented by a lot of the Hollywood Movies, with perhaps fairly good portrayals of the Russian and German soldiers. However, the outcome of the movie becomes some what obvious. The appearance of a well dressed Gestapo officer in the field with a shaved head and goatie beard sporting a modern designer style long leather coat almost makes the movie satirical."
2,Worst war movie since War Kill,"The uniforms and equipment looked accurate. The acting and the script were terrible. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The shame of it was that a few of the actors were fairly talented, but saddled with incredibly bad lines. The cigarette puffing contests between the brothers were laughable. The Russian commander whose face has adorned several horror movies demonstrated why he rarely speaks. We rented this movie from Redbox for a dollar and that was too much. I thought War Kill with George Montgomery was the worst war film I'd ever seen, but Brother's War is the ""Showgirls"" of war films."
1,detroit ain't 70's cleveland,"Let's just say these songs are not lyrically driven. So many songs sound unrehearsed, out of tune, though a few are amusing enough to keep some interest, ""here comes that sound again,"" ""cedar point '76,"" and ""they hate us in scandinavia."" I'm not sure why this collection leaves out their best tune, ""Do You See My Love (For You Growing)""? Much is borrowed from The Stooges and early Pere Ubu (Rocket from the Tombs), which offers nothing new. Mick Collins says the best stuff is on compilations, if he's right; (which he's not) try The Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit lp, which is the best Detroit has this side of the White Stripes."
4,A mechanical engineer's perspective,"Pejsa's book presents a well-researched examination of the theory of ballistics starting from first principles of physics and progressing through the effects of drag and elevation. I have personally verified his results at short ranges, and can attest to the fact that his formulas will work within their limitations.The problem with his results stems from the fact that his formulas do not easily transition through the transsonic and subsonic speed ranges. His formulas, by their algebraic nature do not automatically compensate for the point at which the bullet changes from one drag region to another the way a differential treatment can.That said, the algebraic methods described in this book bring individually tailored ballistics information to anyone willing to do the math."
5,You need to get one!,Unbelievable quality and craftsmanship. It's very bright and very lightweight. This unit is about twice as bright and about 1/4th the weight of my 3-D-cell Maglite. Charges fast too. I'm going to really love saving $$ on not having to buy D batteries any more!
4,a fresh look,"this book is targeted at the experienced cake decorator. It demonstrates the use of European style cake decorating with sugarpaste/fondant icing. It is full of exciting and sometimes elaborate decorations. The book is fully illustrated with enough detailed instruction to ensure good results. Inexperienced or new cake decorators can also get lots of ideas from this book, and could easily adapt many of the designs to a more simple example. the method for each cake design is explained in detail step by step and has many helpful hints to stop errors for the inexperienced."
5,Great Cryptos from Great Minds,"In this book, Louise Moll has collected 10 quotes each from some of the best minds ever and encrypted them. Accompanied by Jim Sharpe's excellent illustrations of each person before their quotes. People included are: St. Thomas Aquinas, Einstein, Epicurus, Gandhi & Oscar Wilde to name a few. There are 30 in all. The quotes range from sentimental to hilarious. Hours of enjoyment to be had by all who love good cryptograms."
1,No hints given!!!!,"Not as good as other books -- no hints means I'm stuck sometimes. Choose another title, or be prepared to be frustrated!"
5,Fun,Keeps this old mind busy and believe me it needs all the help it can get. Age only limits us if we let it
2,No hints.,"If the author wants you to buy the book, the least it should contain a set of hints.I will not buy this author again. Seems a lazy effort to me"
2,Please stop crying already!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. Some little girl in his class had one and he wanted the ""boy"" version (Jordan). This toy is annoying! It has a piercing high pitched laugh and cry that goes right through us. If you bump it by accident you have to put it back to sleep. The sounds it makes remind me of a weird Japanese cartoon.It cost a lot for what it does. It really was not worth the $$ but he wanted it."
2,Not long lasting,This toy quit working within 20 minutes of playing. We replaced it & it quit within 5 minutes! NEVER had this problem with any other toy. DO not recommend!
1,Kindle Version is Terrible,"I loved this book; I had it in print a long time ago. I culled my book collection a few years ago and this didn't make the cut so I was thrilled to discover there was an ebook version available. Imagine my disappointment when I tried to read it and it is so riddled with editing errors (""1"" for ""I"", ""Aria"" for ""Arla"", some sentences flat missing words, other words a jumble of letters and numbers, ""m"" commonly replacing ""rn"", periods missing from whole paragraphs) it is practically unreadable. I honestly do not understand how something so poorly proofread made it to production or how they could possibly charge people money for it. The free ebooks have significantly less errors than this book. If you are interested in reading Reclamation, please please please by a paper copy. You'll hate the book otherwise."
2,A tad too tedious.,"Having read the Foundation and Hyperion series, and enjoyed them tremendously, I was ""recommended"" Reclamation by my friends at Amazon. Reclamation isn't easy to follow. I constantly felt like I was reading the second or third novel of a series, missing a lot of the background."
3,maybe too well developed,"though i usually enjoy complex well-developed universes, this one was a little too well developed. there were so many details, at times it was difficult to follow and keep track of all the factions. by the end things cleared up a bit, but because of the long catch up period i did not enjoy it as much as i should have. maybe if the author had stretched the same story into two books it would have given me the opportunity to learn all the critical background information so that i could enjoy the plot without having to spend all my time trying to remember where each character fits in."
1,Worthless mass-produced junk,"Don't waste your time on this one, which is about as creative as whatever the latest sci fi shows on TV are--at best. Boring flat characters, a lame plot which is wrapped up so quickly it's almost perfunctory. Interesting bald black robed figures as bad guys, very remiscent, of, oh, just about half of all recent movies? Borg like? Like the guys in Dark City? Skip it!"
1,Why'd I have to give a star?,"This is a sophomoric, poorly visualized first sci fi novel. Too bad it won't be the last. Characters are cardboard, plot is tired, and many of the images are rehashed from sci fi movies--the most interesting characters appear to be ripped off from Star Trek (the Borg) or the film Dark City. Don't waste your time."
5,One of the best Sci-Fi books I've read in years.,"What makes this so interesting is what made the ""Foundation"" Triology by Asimov so great: there is a grand design whichthe author hints at throughout the book. It's final revelation had me wanting to reread the final 50-100 pages because I wasn't sure I actually ""got"" the grand finale. Considering I skip over a lot of nonsense in this genre I found that I couldn't afford to skip one paragraph becaue then I would miss an important aspect of one of the characters or part of the plot. A must read. C"
3,Maybe it's just me...,"Lots of people really liked this book. Maybe something is wrong with me.Although the novel was very good conceptually, I found it to be very long and tedious to read. I could understand what she was talking about, but the details all seemed vague nonetheless. 500 pages and I feel like I have virtually no imagery to show for it.Still, it is a very well written book. I just couldn't really sink my teeth into it. For someone else it might be a great read."
1,Breaks easily,First one broke in less than a week with moderate winds. Replaced it and the second broke the first night. Wouldn't buy again.
4,Does its job,"This mount was easy to install, and is sturdy and well made. I use it to hold a pole mount for birdfeeders."
5,Sturdy bracket for flags or other uses,"I bought a pair of these brackets to install some flags. They work wonderfully. They are adjustable through a large range, and solidly built. They have not been out in the elements long enough to comment on their durability, but if their construction is any indication, they'll hold up just fine. Although we are using these for flagpoles right now, I could see any number of other uses where you want a 1"" pole attached to a wall. I would even consider using them to put up a temporary handrail, they're that sturdy."
1,HORRIBLE FLAG POLE BRACKET,"I had my flag up no more than 30 mins, in winds of 10-15 mph and the base of this bracket cracked and fell on my car. I would NOT buy this bracket!"
4,very good,"It's perfect, I like it so much. I ordered the whole set because I like the design, simple but yet so elegant."
3,"An easy choice - a fun, bright read","This is a bright and breezy book, the sort that Krentz excels at. Juliana is a wonderfully memorable heroine, a shade under 6 foot, a shade too overpowering, collecting marriage proposals but never getting married as the men start to realize how powerful her personality is and run away. But Travis isn't running. He hunted her out initially because she belonged to the family that wronged him. The revenge plot winds its way through the book but isn't integral to the romance. Juliana dismisses all his plotting with a swipe at how could he have thought himself in love with her paler, quieter cousin in any case. I liked her, she feels like a quintessentially 80's woman, and I'm glad Travis could keep up. This book predates Starbucks, but Juliana and Charisma coffee feel prescient to me. This is a reread and a keeper for me."
2,The heroine was crazy. This book wasn't for me!,"Lady's Choice by Jayne Ann Krentz has one of the bossiest and craziest heroines that I've read in a romantic book. The heroine has just slept with the hero for the first time, and the next morning she is telling him how they are going to get married. What? And the hero is not running for his life! This book just wasn't for me. And I love Jayne Ann Krentz, but this one jumped the shark. I wanted to quit reading it several times just because the heroine was so pushy and unlikeable. But the hero was great though. He wanted revenge against the heroine for the way that her family treated him. If it hadn't been for the hero, I would have put this book in my yard sale pile unread."
2,Krentz's heroine is snappy to the point of annoying.,"I have yet to read a Krentz novel I couldn't put down but, ""Lady's Choice"" almost became the first. Her heroine is just a bit too snappy and self absorbed to be really likeable. Ms Krentz takes family loyalty too far. Somewhere someone should aknowledge and attempt to make amends for their unscrupulous behavior. Unlike family members in other novels by Krenz the Grants' have no charming or eccentric traits to make the reader forgive their behavior. They just come off selfish and rude. In the end Julianna does make the right choice but her character would have been oh so much more likeaable if her decision was made sooner. I never really could reconcile why Travis put up with Julianna or her family's antics."
5,"Exciting, romantic book!","I loved it! The hero and heroine are much different from Krentz's usual characters, very unique and interesting. I couldn't put this book down."
5,An awesome gift for your kids!,This is was the best Christmas gift I have ever received and am SO grateful my dad was so willing to give up his time to fill it out. I knew a lot about my dad but this definitely filled in some of the gaps. We have highly recommended this book to many of our friends. INCREDIBLE!!!
2,Very Religious,I never expected the heavy Christian overtones in this journal. It's way too hokey for my Dad--or at least for what I was hoping to give him.
2,The New Bette Davis! She yodels! She jumps about to music!,"This is the cast album to a 1952 Broadway musical starring Bette Davis. It has (mostly) mediocre songs written by Vernon Duke and Ogden Nash, and probably never would have made it to Broadway without the star power of Miss Davis. Naturally, I never saw the show, but judging from this album, Bette was the worst thing in it. Vernon Duke was quoted as saying, ""Bette had four notes to her voice, all of them bad"". Most of the other people in the show sang well enough, with the exception of Hiram Sherman. But most of the songs aren't that great. The bonus tracks include ""Vernon Duke Plays Vernon Duke"", which was a Double EP from 1953. It consists of four medleys of Vernon Duke songs played on piano by Vernon Duke himself, with occasional vocals by a female singer. The CD ends with two more Vernon Duke songs, ""I Can't Get Started"" sung by Nancy Walker and ""I'm Gonna Ring the Bell Tonight"" sung by Jack Smith, both of which are quite good."
5,Excellent,My husband requires gluten free food and Bob's Red Mill products work very well for me in my bread machine and when I make other items requiring gluten free flour.
2,Poor Condition,I love what I got but the item failed me both ends of the barbell are not screwing in. They fell off during the first wear.
3,Mysterious beginning,The background or history of the main story is almost half of the book and the main story starts with the amnesia victim in the battlefield. It kept me wondering about the main plot of the story until I reached the section about the amnesiac meeting with Hannah Rose. It's mysterious at first because of the unknown assassin which could have been cut shorter on how it'srelated with the amnesia victim who's the main character . The biblical passages are somehow enlightening and inspiring.
4,Pretty darn good,"Keeps her arms from escaping, helps her stay asleep, can be warm (wish it were made of muslin, can get her feet out of the bottom, overall really happy with this product, def. serves its purpose, use for every nap and night"
5,Must Buy!,My child has reflux/colic and she has slept through the night since we brought her home thanks only to this miracle blanket. I want to keep her in it 24 hours a day. It is fabulous. I have two right now. She is almost three months old. I'm not sure what we will do when she is too big for it...
4,Expensive but worth it,"I had several moms tell me that I had to have the Miracle Blanket to swaddle my newborn daughter. At first, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. I thought it was too big and too complicated to use. Once a friend showed me how to use it, however, I didn't use anything else. The Miracle Blanket did what others couldn't - keep her hands tucked in all night long. When we used receiving blankets to swaddle her, she always managed to get at least one hand out, no matter how tightly she was swaddled. We also tried the other swaddle blankets with the velcro. Those were loud and annoying to use and were easy for her to wiggle a hand out of. It's true that you get what you pay for. The Miracle Blanket might be more expensive that the rest, but it's well worth the extra cost."
5,Turned believer,Ok so I didn't really buy all the stories about this blanket -- I mean it is just a blanket that swaddles a baby. We have been swaddling our babies since they were born but our boy was a poor sleeper and had lots of problems with colic. I did not want to give him any drugs and after many people telling me to try the miracle blanket I finally decided I had nothing to lose. Well I am now a believer -- the first night was a huge difference but I thought maybe it was a coincidence. After several more nights I know that it works. I would recommend this to anyone who has a baby that needs help sleeping.
3,So-So,"This blanket is nice because it is a little more flexible to the size of your baby, but does not cause baby to stop fidgeting or sleep through the night as suggested... but maybe this is just my baby."
1,Looks good - but didn't work for us,"I cannot comment on how useful this item is for swaddling a baby as we are not due for a few months.However, I just wanted to comment that the colour of the blanket is much nicer than the online picture. We have purchased the green with beige trim. The picture doesn't do it justice. It is more mint colored and the beige trim highlights it rather than making it look a little like a bandage (as I think the picture online does).The original manufacturer also has a website and there is a video of how to use this swaddle on there. That was useful to me as a soon-to-be first time Mom.***********************REVIEW:Baby arrived. He HATES LOATHES DESPISES this. He can kick his legs out of it in sec. I bought 2 as I figured he'd be likely to soil it in the night and since everyone said it was such a miracle I didn't want to be without. I'd recommend you buy just one of these and try it out."
2,No help for my baby,"Didn't work. The swaddlers that have velcro are so bulky and get messed up in the wash. I bought this cause of no velcro & hoped it would help my baby sleep, who sleeps like 3 hours out of a 24 hour period.It didn't. Baby busted right out of it and bawled her eyes out."
2,Worked for Two Weeks,"I bought this because a friend recommended it to me after my daughter, at 4 months, was able to break free of the HALO swaddle blanket. My daughter was NOT ready to not be swaddled, she still did (and does at 6 months) have a very sensitive startle reflex. She would only sleep if she was swaddled. I had hoped that paying $30 for a blanket, it would work longer than it did. I was happy at first because it seemed to work, but within two weeks, my daughter learned how to break free and it became more of a safety hazard than a sleep aid. It's pretty, but it isn't good for older babies...maybe little ones who can't move much yet, but then why bother spending so much money on a swaddle blanket?"
5,Lifesaver!,"This is by far the best swaddling blanket-period. I have 4 of them and used them for two kids. My first was a real Houdini and could get out of EVERYTHING else- except for this. The material and stitching are excellent and have survived countless washings in boiling water. It really takes the fudge factor out of the swaddling and you can even get it on correctly in the middle of the night when you are have asleep. The only other one that seems this good is the Woombie but you have to buy multiple sizes of that one and as each is around $30, it's way more cost effective to get the Miracle Blanket- which you can use from newborn until pretty much when your baby doesn't need to be swaddled anymore."
4,Surprise - it works!,"This toy is reasonably accurate and reasonably safe, as long as players wear their eye protection. I can tell the guns won't last long, but they're fun while they last. Be sure to buy extra darts."
1,The Tunguska Event,"Hi! I have not read this book. Just a comment, though. I see that he argues that no trace of the incoming body connected with the Tunguska event 1908 over Sibera has ever been recovered. Well, that is simply not true. Tiny particles assumed to be from the comet/asteroid has been recovered from the inside of chared trees by scienticif expeditions investigating the disaster area. I have a picture of these particles if anyone is interested. So they are not inviseble at all.RegardsJorgen DanielssonSweden"
4,Grooving tunes from 1969,"Never ever heard of them, despite having been born in the same year, but that has never ever stopped me from listening to new (and old)things. And this is a real classic psychedelic treasure from the 60's! Cool well played grooving tunes mellowed out to the ethereal bonfire smoke that drifts across hazy landscapes of your dreams.It is the second of the two albums recorded for Capitol in the 1960s. It is often regarded by some as the better but as I've not heard the first offering I cannot say. This final Stained Glass Release has a somewhat stoned smoky, more impro jamming feel that I really dig. I would highly recommended to any psychedelic fan.The guitar work is superb, the drums and percussion are first rate. The singing is mostly top notch occassionally let down now and again by being weak. I really like it. Get it while you can!!!!"
1,Extremely Outdated!,"Obviously transferred from an old vcr recording, the coaching techniques in this video are at least twenty-five years old. They don't even lift in the lineouts! This DVD is a total rip-off. You are much better off going to web sites and downloading coaching videos."
1,Wrong Item sent,"Horrible service from Target who advertized the battery on Amazon! They sent the wrong item! It was not even close to what was advertized and ordered. When I complained, they said they had no more batteries like the one I ordered in stock. I'll never do businesss with Target again!P.S. Amazon.com helped me correct the problem and sold me the correct battery--even cheaper than what I ordered from Target. Hooray for Amazon.com!"
5,Great YA fiction,"""Janie's Girl"" was a great novel, similar to Naylor's ""Ice"", which I'd also definitely recommend.Claire, 14, and her single mother decide to go visit her grandmother's farm for the summer, and Claire is very excited, having never really known her grandmother. There, she begins to discover the secrets of her family: who her father was, what her grandfather was like, how her mother's life was as a girl, and why she never knew these things.Throughout this book, Claire also deals with a friend sick with leukemia, family ties, and a romance with a ""farmboy"" neighbor. An excellent read for any teenager!"
4,Secrets and Family,"Janey's Girl read easily, with beautiful, simple descriptions throughout of nature and life. The pages of this book had a sweet wood smell.Claire learns about her family that her mother kept secret when they both visit Gran. (From an astrological point of view, Janey sounds like a Scorpio or Capricorn, what with all the secrets and control [plus being a workaholic with a cold demeanor].) Claire learns the whereabouts of her father and meets Jamie, his son. She helps Jamie in a unique way at the end. Claire encounters Jack in interesting places and kisses him. After Claire read her mother's diary about her getting pregnant, Claire sneaks out with Jack to see the birth of a calf. I enjoy seeing themes and coincidence in books.I liked this emotional story of secrets and family."
3,Author needed a good critique group,"This book was okay, and that's all. If she had had a reallygoodcritique group some of the weaknesses would have been eliminated andimproved this overall presentation. Too many issues are raised to deal with any of them successfully. I would like to see something more from her in the future however."
4,Studying Congregations Review,"The book is great. It outlines how to study a congregation with objectivity as the key. It also provides sample surveys, which is great. Good for individuals or for group research."
3,"Good ideas, bad illistrations",The ideas and methods that this book presents are very good and useful. I have used some of them in my own ministry. Some of the illistrations that the author uses are very liberal illistrations to make her point.
5,An excellent debut CD from talented Nikki,"This CD is great, I highly recommend it to everyone. It has had 3 singles from it, Strawberry Kisses, Depend on Me, The Best Days and has the potential for many more. They are very catchy songs that display Nikkis amazing vocal talent. Get this album today!!!!!! I'm sure it will be the first of many great albums from this talented young singer."
5,Amazeing.,"This CD is absolutely amazeing.Nikki Webster has the potential to become a star throughout the world, if only shes giving the chance. So far she's had her first single ""Strawberry Kisses"" in the ARIA chart for about 7 weeks as number 2, and this album went straight in as number 6.All the songs on the album is fantastic, it's impossible for me, to choose a favorite, in Nikki's words ""I love all of them"".Keep up the good work."
1,A waste of money,"I wear a 9 1/2,the first pair I bought the ankle strap was torn,Amazon took care of it,but the 9 1/2M was narrow.I reordered this shoe in a size 10M,and are still a lousey fit.I love Nine West shoes,they always fit real nice,but this style sux,I can't wear them because they feel as if they are falling off my feet,I'm stuck with them.It will be a long time befor I buy shoes from Amazon."
4,A different view of New Order,"I never had the chance to see New Order perform live, and having listened to this I'm sorry I never did. New Order on stage is a vastly different proposition than their fussy, perfect production studio albums. The music has a whole different feel live. The spontaneousness actually makes some of their songs more tuneful. The only regret is that the album contains only nine cuts, drawn heavilly from their 1986 album ""Brotherhood."" That said, this one is definately for fans only. Like most live albums, the appeal is likely to be lost on casual listeners."
1,Another disappointing live performance,"Sadly, I must agree with Christian Turk. Some New Order live performances are great (my favorite is still the 1981 Radio Order recording in Stockholm), but this one is just bad. Both Barney's singing (a generous term) and guitar work are horrible. The sound mixing isn't great either, often masking the bass guitar sound characteristic to New Order. Save yourself a big disappointment and pass up this record."
5,brand new as described in excellent condition,brand new as described in excellent condition never used. Will be using for school and personal growth. Will use the book with a group setting.
4,Great Overview of Tiling Fundamentals,"This book covers all of the tiling basics: floors, countertops, walls, etc. Written for the novice, this book was helpful at communicating all of the necessary steps for a successful tiling project in a layout that was easy to understand. The author has had many years experience doing tiling projects himself, so I felt comfortable with all of his suggestions and advice.My only complaint is that some of the areas of the book might be a bit dated. I believe that there may be some newer materials and techniques that are not mentioned in the book. Nevertheless, it was a great introduction to tiling fundamentals."
1,Not well written,"I purchased this book hoping to get valueable information on the understanding of tile work.In addition to aquire ideas that would benefit me in achieving such goals.This book I found to be poorly written, the examples (pictures)provided were outdated and poorly presented to say the least.Save your hard earned money, this to me was Not worth the price !!"
4,good choice for amature project,"Some friends and I wanted to do a tie dye project for upcoming mud run team t-shirts. We wanted vibrant colors. The fact that this kit comes with a package of soda ash to fix the dye is really important. Unlike some other kits I've seen, the soda ash will ensure bright colors that don't fade to pastel with one wash! Super easy to understand instructions. My only complaint...in my opinion the box saying the kit will dye up 5 t-shirts is a stretch. No way it will do 5 adult t-shirts anyway. Maybe 5 small kid sized."
3,Tye Die Kit,"I got this tye die kit for my son. The colors are very vibrant and he enjoyed making his own shirts.However, the shipping was terrible. The box got to me all smashed up and not in very good condition. I would not purchase from this vendor again if they consistently ship products this way."
2,Disappointing,"Fabozzi was the ""editor"" of this volume but he offered no comment or introduction. Some of the articles appeared to have been hastily written. The articles in the book are so brief and inadequate, and yet the book contains no suggested further readings or bibliography. Given the book's disappointing quality and brevity (262 pages), I strongly object to its price of 75 US dollars. I have seen better books with Fabozzi's name on them."
4,"Instructional, a part of the puzzle","Read this and The Art of Inking, and you have probably read the best two sources of info regarding this subject available from a book. The two books are complementary in a way, covering different aspects. Klaus Johnson isn't my favorite author in readability/page-turning writing style, but the book is effective and helpful. I would look at both books and PRACTICE!!"
5,"Understanding the ""WHY IS THAT?"" about inking","When it comes to drawing or inking you have to understand the rules. Some people have natural ability when it comes to inking and they couldn't tell you exactly ""why"" they inked in a particular way. This book definitely goes into that realm. It will tell you the fundamentals of the inking process and in time you will develop your own inking style. This book is worth adding to your drawing reference library."
2,Nothing new here,I guess I expected some insider perspective and more. Klaus' writing is good and informative but I expected more than basic inking techniques.
4,Lot of samples but need more analysis,Great book! Has lot of references from a whole gamut of comic genres. But I feel that it could have done better with more analysis of those examples.Paper quality and the printing does justice to the book.Worth keeping a copy.
3,"Wordy and preachy, but still helpful.","Klaus Janson has been working in the comic book profession for decades. He is a proficient inker, but not the best author of instructional books. There are some good tips in this book, but you have to slog through his wordy and preachy writing style to find them. I haven't read any other books that are devoted solely to comic book inking so I can't recommend a perfect alternative, but here is one suggestion. Andy Smith devotes nineteen pages to inking in his book Drawing Dynamic Comics, which is excellent. You can get almost as much out of those nineteen pages as you can out of Klaus' whole book. If you pick up a copy of Smith's book and one of the many books about pen and ink that aren't specifically related to comics, you should do quite well."
