4,So far so good...,"I was a little bit nervous when I bought this Travel Mug because of the other reviews saying that it leaks internally, I have used it for 2 months now and I am happy to say that it's still perfect. It has a leather kinda material that wraps arround the Mug and the handle wich gives it a classy look and feel and the cap mecanism is very, VERY good against spills... I'll be updating my review if anything happens..."
1,Leaks,Cup leaks around top. I have ruined 2 shirts with coffee stains. This is unacceptable product liability. I know you can do better.
3,ehh...,"I drink coffee or latte at least twice a day, and I can't stand lukewarm drink;so I may be on a little more picky side.<2 flaws: 1 major and 1 minor>1) barely keeps my coffee hot/warm for less than one hour.. no way near 2 hours as claimed. I'm in NJ and tried it out for the past 4 days at around 40~50 degree outside temp. in my car. And I usually don't turn on the heater unless it goes below freezing.2) the leatherette cover LOOKS and FEELS very nice. I actually like it very much. However, water seeps out for quite some time after each washing/rinsing as I, sometimes, rinse it right before pouring a fresh coffee. I obviously air dried/wipe dried the mug thoroughly before use, but water that gets between the leatherette cover and the body takes quite some time to dry. I suspect that it would grow mold after some time.It's a return for me...Hope this helps"
3,coffeelover,"The best thing about this mug is the way it looks. I get compliments on it all the time; however, I purchased it hoping that it would hold up and do the job of keeping my coffee hot and be spill-proof. I has let me down on both counts. I've had it for less than a year and the hardware is loosening. I tried to tighten the handle, because there is a screw in there, but it would not tighten. It is not, nor has it ever been, completely spill proof and the coffee starts to cool before I've finished drinking it. In conclusion, if you want a mug that looks sharp this is it. If you want something to take care of your coffee, look elsewhere."
2,Travel coffee mug,"This mug is great looking ,however it does not keep your beverage hot .I had to buy a other one instead .also when you clean tge cup it has a lip on the inside that does not come clean si you can taste old coffee or cream .nit very sanitary .i would pass in this one unless you want it for tge office and don't care about the temperature"
2,Cheap stiching and junk,I was so disappointed in this mug that I gave it to my kids to use. I expected better quality for such a high price!
1,Disappointed by Quality,I bought this mug for my husband for Christmas. I liked the design and it looked like a good product. I was highly disappointed when the handle broke off after only 4-5 uses. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,It's alright,"Delightful in theory and attractive, but it requires hand washing and it's very narrow and makes it hard to reach my hand in to clean it. Additionally, when left in the sink once, the mug took water into the insulating part which took quite a while to drain out and when it would, it would do so randomly and drip on my desk and papers. This mug is alright, but I wouldn't purchase another one of these."
4,Valentine's Gift,I bought this for my hubby and he hasn't seen it yet but I know he will love it. The style and the handle of this mug is great. I like it that it helps to control the temperature of the liquid when you travel. This will help with the coffee that he drinks daily to and from work and home.
5,Very Cool Travel mug,Very Cool Travel mug. Great spill proof design. Looks real nice. Locking lid is watertight. You can drink from any side of the cup.The lid comes apart for cleaning.
2,Same as all the other travel mugs,"Very disappointed. I thought after reading reviews, this was a mug to keep coffee hot. It did no better than the ones I already have"
5,Perfect Travel Mug!,"This is the best travel mug I have ever owned. It is well made, very attractive, and holds a lot of coffee. Just like the description says, it honestly doesn't leak. I also like the clear OPEN/CLOSED imprint on the lid. There are other colors available but I really like the soft pink. You do need to be careful washing it - hand wash only and DO NOT allow it to soak in water."
2,Handle is not sturdy :(,"I liked the fact that this mug had stainless steel inside than plastic. But, the handle is really poorly made. I bought two of these mugs and after 2 weeks, the handles of both mugs started to shake. This mug would have been perfect if it had a sturdy handle.. Disappointed :-("
3,Finish not good,I have purchased two of these. 1 with and 1 without the Handle. The units are excellent except for the Finish. Both have begun to peel off from the top down. One unit has lost the top third of the finish! We do put these in the dishwasher but it did state that they are dishwasher safe.
5,Great cup,"I'm a sucker for a great travel mug. I have to work a bunch so just having something nice to look at while I'm busy doing my job is a plus.Stainless steel throughout. Many are metal on the outside and plastic inside. This is not. Handle is great. Not too wide for cup holders in the car. Lid has a sure switching motion for ""open"" and ""closed"" to avoid spills. Very secure.Like the handle. Bought a really nice plastic travel mug and the handle broke on the first drop. Doubt anything short of a mack truck could harm this thing.I would get lazy and drop my mugs in the dishwasher. Out of respect (and the leather trim)I hand wash all my travel mugs now. The leather trim would probably not survive a dishwasher for very long. However I soak it hand washing and the trim does not seem to be affected."
3,GOOD IF YOU ARE A SIPPER AND NOT A GULPER,"I purchased 2 for my husband. He drinks 1 on his way to work and 1 while on the job as a contractor. He complained his old cups no longer kept his coffee hot. These are sturdy, well made and insulated, but the lid is a poor design. It is great if you are a sipper, but if you try to tilt it any farther than that it comes out around the entire opening and floods your face. I have traded my mug for one of his. It works fine for me because I do sip my coffee...also it is difficult to get the last couple of sips out without removing the lid. If you take large sips or gulp your coffee I don't recommend."
3,slow drinker,The cup is good and keeps coffee warm for a good amount of time It did take some fiddling with the lid to adjust the flow for drinking but aqfter that it worked fine
1,moldy,I used this mug for approx. 8 months. I was very careful to empty and wash/rinse after each use. I noticed a horrible musty smell coming from inside the mug. I thought it was the lid at first so I unscrewed the lid and cleaned thoroughly. However it came from under the rim at the top of the inside of the mug. I am unable to clean the mold out and have to throw the mug away.
1,bad seal design,"Looks nice. Locking lid is watertight. BUT, on mine, there was a gap in the seal between the aluminum and plastic on the inside that allows liquid to get in and fester. I couldn't figure out why it kept smelling like spoiled milk even after several extreme washings (and no, I did not put it in a dishwasher). That was because there WAS spoiled coffee with milk up inside the gap between the plastic 'seal' and aluminum body! While cleaning, I noticed that stuff was coming out from under the plastic rim.I took it apart and resealed the lip with epoxy, but I should NOT have had to reengineer their product!For this price, that is ridiculous. (p.s. I only paid $9 for it at Target, so maybe I had an 'earlier' version)."
1,Unhygienic !!!,"This mug was great for the first couple weeks I owned it, until it started smelling consistently like bad milk. No matter how well I cleaned it or soaked it, I couldn't get rid of that smell. Turns out (and I see a lot of others have the same complaint on here) that the liquid has a habit of getting between the walls of the mug and festering in there growing god knows what... I pulled the top off and had a look at what was inside and immediately threw the entire product in the trash.The mug looks good, the lid works well, but unless you like the smell of sour milk and drinking whatever mould and bacteria decides to grow in the walls of this mug I suggest buying something else."
1,Poor quality control,"Beautiful, put did not seal from the moment it arrived. I've asked for a replacement; we'll see how that goes!"
1,Leaks alot!,"The mug looks great, that's about it! I bought two so that my husband and I could have coffee on our morning walk to the beach. About halfway through our walk I noticed that my mug was leaking from the lid seal and where the aluminum/plastic join together. A half mile later my husband complained about the same thing. By the time we got home both cups were a sticky mess. As my husband says when we get a bum meal or a bum item, ""Scratch that place!"""
1,Mold -Yuck!,"Hate this mug! I got it as a gift from someone who thought they were getting all fancy by spending WAY too much on a mug. I used it for several years out of guilt. The liquid gets trapped between the layers of the lid and there is NO goood way to clean it. I ended up soaking it in Sigg cleaner tablets and inserting small brushes in between the layers. Even with doing that every day, mold built up in the layers. YUCK! I threw it away, gladly."
2,Battery Eater,"This camera goes through batteries so fast it makes it nearly useless. You're probably thinking ""So what? All digital cameras run through batteries quickly."" Not like this one my friend. Even with the LCD screen turned off, you've got about a half hour and a handfull of flash pictures max. It also has extremly little built in storage, but this isn't that great of an issue since SD cards are getting pretty cheap. Picture quality, features, software, and everything else about the camera is fine. I just can't get past having to cary a pocket full of back up batteries around just to be able to take some pics."
2,BATTERY EATING MONSTER,"This thing eats batteries, it can literally go through a set of 2AA batteries in 15 pictures or less. I have had it over a year now and I rarely use it because it is such a pain to put in new batteries every time you want to snap some pictures. I just use my camera phone now to take pictures."
3,Never in stock - power hungry - broken upon receipt,"I really wanted this camera - a great price for so many pixels. Their were 2 problems, however. First, the camera is almost never in stock. I would think that with such a high demand, Vivitar would get the idea & start making a few more of them.Finally I received my camera and, to my disappointment, it drained the batteries constantly whether it was on or off. At a trip to Disneyland I found I had to buy and change the batteries 3 times.I wanted to exchange the camera except for, guess what, there were none in stock. I would love to have one of these models that worked, however, I am entirely frustrated with the process."
1,"Do not buy this junk, seriously",I bought this camera for my daughter's birthday and I regretted that deeply. It does not format SD cards appropriately and the built-in memory can hold only 20 photos. The quality of the display screen is terrible and it is overall made cheap like a 5-dollar toy camera.
2,batteries always need recharging,"I bought mine at the local Wal-Mart for $132.00 in Nov.03. My first set of batteries that were included went dead the second day I used it. After two more sets of batteries I got the rechargable nimh type, and I constantly recharge those. I'm not taking but a few pics each time I use it but jeeze it sure does drain the power. Also, every time you put the fresh batteries back in you have to set up the camera again. I wish someone could tell me why my windows xp system won't retrieve the photos from the usb port-I've tried everything and asked many others what could be wrong! I've uninstalled the ports and reinstalled them and the instructions say I don't need to use the drivers included, my xp system is supposedly ready for this system. Meanwhile, my batteries go dead again trying to download the pics to a cd instead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,ASSISTANCE ==PLEASE,"I HAVE HAD THIS CAMERA FOR 5 WEEKS AND AM STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT ??? IN LOADING THE SOFTWARE [PHOTOSUITE 4]THE PROGRAM ASKES ""CHOOSE A CAMERA"" . VIVITAR ISN'T LISTED ??? I HAVE WINDOWS ME--I MAY HAVE TO RETURN IT !!! CAN ANYONE HELP ME ??"
3,It's Alright,"For an artist who doesnt have big hits, she is very well known and liked. Me personally I dont think Keyshia Cole is a bad artist but I dont think she's nothing special either. It's obvious she's been through a couple of bad relationships, she makes that known throughout the whole album. Keyshia has a nice voice but at the same time, she tends to kill alot of songs and Im not talkin about killin a song in a good way. Keyshia Cole lacks vocal control, especially when she's trying to hit high notes and I can't feel that. Her ablum overall is decent but she needs better production. She has nice lyrics that women (and men) can relate to but other then that everything else is pretty much average. Maybe on her next album she will step her game up but this album aint doing it for me. She need to expand her writting and become more creative and diverse. There is more to life."
3,"Good, but it could better","It took me while to actually get used to this album. But when I did it was pretty good minus a few songs. SUPERSTAR was a tragedy. It starts off with a smooth beat until you here these guys in the backgroud screaming 1-2-3-4! It's like, what the heck is that! Then she absolutly killed Luthers song. So sad. And LOVE could have been a good song but she ruined it with the chorus. ""I found, I found, I found love..."" She need to find some new vocals. Okay, now that i've got that out the way the rest of the album is pretty solid. My favorites YOU'VE CHANGED and 1through 3 and 8."
3,A Missed Opportunity,"I must admit I was skeptical about purchasing The Way It Is, Keyshia Cole's freshman LP. After reading so many reviews highlighting Ms. Cole's voice, I had to make the purchase. I'm not disappointed that I did because the girl can definately sing, but she had the chance to do something special with this album. The album starts off as powerful as they come showcasing Keyshia's soulful voice, mixed with the production of Krucial Keys on the first track and Kanye West on the second. Another standout song is ""I Should Have Cheated"". Its climatic, the hook is perfect, and Keyshia's full vocal talents are on display.The song that ruined the album for me was ""Superstar"". The song had such potential but the military-like hook with guys screaming ""1-2-3-4"" killed the song. In the end, The Way It Is is worth buying for Ms. Cole's amazing vocals, but 2-3 songs took this album from a 5-star rating to 3-stars."
5,LOOOVE IT!!,"Keyshia Cole resembles tha kinda artist we need more of. Too much of watz out rite now sounds tha same. I agree with a previous person who rated this album.--Keyshia Cole is different because her voiced isn't polished, and hasn't been trained for years, like (although VERY good artists) Beyonce and Mariah Carey. But isnt that what we like about her? This album is HoTT. Her management sux tho. i've only seen her on TV twice, and i wouldnt be surprised if 2/3 ppl didnt kno who she was. Which sux 4 her, bc she has an amazing voice. KEYSHIA: FIRE YOUR STREET TEAM & FIND ANOTHER LABEL. NOBODY is pushing this album enough."
2,Keyshia COLD (is what it should be),"I really can't believe that people are actually feelin' this ablum the way they are, because it sounds no different than anyother album from a female artist that you would have heard in the mid 90's. Yes that's right I said the 90's besides maybe ""I've changed my mind"", ""I just want it to be over"", and ""Superstar"", the rest are really lacking. Lacking in content, lackin in production, lackin in true talent. She's not doing anything out of the ordinary that make her stand out from the crowd. It sounded like this cd was done like 10 years ago, and they just got the budget to release it or something. I might have listened to this cd like 4 times since buying it. I am very disappointed!"
2,Love.........only three of the songs on the CD deserve it!,"Okay, I got trapped with the Love song, too. I am guilty of buying CD's for just one song which is what I did with this one. But I did listen to the entire CD and besides Love, there were only two songs that I like to listen to which are Over and Over and I Should Have Cheated. Her voice is really great, but the other songs are really boring to me. Much respect to Keyshia for doing her thing and I love the show on BET, but I don't think I am going to run out and purchase her second album."
5,Keyshia Is Hot!!,"Her album is one of the best CD's I've heard from any female R&B artist since Mary J. Blige's ""What's The 411?"" debut.....She brings the realness and I haven't seen this in any other female artist since Mary J. Blige....PERIOD!!!!"
3,LOVE NEVER KNEW WHAT I WAS MISSIN TILL I BOUGHT THIS CD,oh my god i love this cd so much i listen to it every day my top 5 favorite songs on her cd is lovei shouldve cheated wow i only got well i have to give advice to the prople maybe you should go by the single insted of the cd yeah that will be smart
2,not very good,"it wasn't very good to me. i liked it the first time i heard it then it just got annoying from there on. The only one song that i still like and still do listen to on a daily basis is ""We Could Be"" other than that, i don't really listen to her album."
5,Passionate and Soulful Debut!!!,"Crispy voice Keyshia Cole delivers powerful, balanced hits from the aftermath of her pain. This album is truly for the ladies. From the climatic I Just Want It To Be Over 5/5 (on second thoughts who needs him) to I Changed My Mind 5/5 (it's all about what a girl wants) to You've Changed 5/5 (love don't live here anymore) this richly textured album is sure to be a chart climber. Miss Cole is talented vocal powerhouse and a rising star who has Alicia Keys written all over her. And for you hopeless romantics...in Keyshia's own words ""If LOVE is your focus...pay attention."" Whoa! She's deeper than a puddle of mud! Fellas don't step to her because she's all about business...That's the way it is!!!"
2,Decent songs,"The songs are decent but this girl can't sing! She reminds me of Mary J. Blige when she first came out, except Mary has way more soul and better songs! It's like the record label created her. They must have thought Mary was getting older so they bring in Ms. Cole for the younger generation. I'm sure will fit in fine but for a true music fan, don't believe the hype."
2,what?,"To start, I will say that I listened to this and hoped for the best since Keyshia is getting all of these comparisons to Mary J. Blige. I just don't agree; this CD doesn't do anything for me and it seems like everything is sung in the same key. Yes, she does have the emotive feel but not the power and pain of Mary's voice so let's stop those comparisons. Little Ms. Cole has potential but has a long way to go. I would say this is a decent first effort but definitely nothing to rant and rave about... What is music coming too????? Bring back the Jills, the Whitneys, the Faiths, the Kellys, and then we can talk about some females that can really blow."
5,You Go Girl!,"This was an ecellent cd, bought it because i liked one song and ended up loving the whole cd. Whether you like rapp or r&b, Keyshia Cole came with it."
5,I Love This Album,"I got to give it up to Keyshia because she got me out of a bad situatuion with my ex. I tell you it took me forever to get over him but when i heard ""I Changed My Mind"", I changed my mind about his behind. Me and Keyshia could share some stories about troubled relationships. Well I really love that song and also ""I Should've Cheated"", ""Superstar"", ""Love"", ""Down and Dirty"", actually I like them all. Thanks Keyshia. I wish you continued sucess."
5,This CD is HOT!!,I fell in love with Keyshia's soulful voice immediately!! Then I heard I Should've Cheated - this girl is bad! Although young it appears shes been through some things. I can put this CD on and let it play from beginning to end then repeat. She has staying power. Not to mention adding Kanye West & Krucial Keys to the mix- that was a recipe for success!!
1,-1 star,This girl should not quit her day job. Somebody needs a new set of ears. If it is me I will be happy to accept. My goodness. Song styles are similar to Brandy's but Brandy can sing. Help somebody please. And to bout she has 4 1/4 stars according to the amazon poll. What is the music world coming to. Since I know there are a lot of appreciation for this CD. And any comparison to Mary J. Blige should be immediately discarded. She could never have the depth of Mary. Someone call the Fire truck and hose her down. I have one for sale anyone interested hit me xison@hotmail.com
1,The Gap Tooth Diaries,"The gap toothe diaries is what this sob story of a cd cd should have been called, I mean it really was the worst this i never did spend my money on and i'm so glad. as u can tell i didn't buy it but heard it from a friend, and i wanted to go to the store a ask 4 a refund 4 him. It was so depressing maybe she is mad about her teeth who knows? Well, furthermore, Cole's attempt to paint a picture of R&B artisry ultimately ends up bleeeding into a mesh of muddy brown....disgusting. How can one bare to listen?"
2,Give Me A Break,"I can't believe the reviews I've read about this album. Who's rating this album................4th graders? Keyshia Cole's album is no different from the so called ""hottness"" out there today. How dare some of you compare her to the late great Aaliyah ! Amerie's Touch CD knocks this one out the box. Ms. Cole does not have a strong voice as some suggested; frankly her voice SUCKS! It's TERRIBLE! Anyone that listens to ""Love"" (Track 6) should understand what I'm talking about. Sounds like she's screaming for help insteading of singing. Alicia Keys, Beyonce, Jill Scott, Fantasia, Lauryn Hill, Mariah, Vivian Green, Mary J. Blige....These are the REAL soul divas of this era and tomorrow. Please stop giving props to these non-singing, no talent having wannabees. I want my money back for this album. In the words of the great Hov....""Grand Opening, Grand Closing"". Forget a sophomore jinx, I don't even think she will make a second album and for God sake, I hope she doesn't."
1,Keyshia....:::yawn:::.....,"We all know Keyshia can sing, but so what. For some reason her song ""Love"" annoys the hell out of me. Especially the part where she says ""I foooooooouuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnd you"" or whatever she says; that part makes me mute the tv or change the radio everytime. It's actually unbearable for me . And, she's just too boring to overlook that part. nothing new or original here. 1 star for a pretty face."
5,terrific,add to your collection of cole's recordinmg. She can do no wrong and you should purchase it and give as gifts
5,It's Hot for a debut Cd,"Keyshia Cole is very talented, and when me n my sister went to Nelly's SweatSuit Concert in Madison Square n she was the opening act, we decided after a did a song acapella, i can't remember right now,to go out n buy the album. My faverite song that im liking more n more each day is We Could Be. But the cd is hot and if u dont have it than u dont know what you are missing."
5,Let iT be kNoWn,Let it be known that this R&B; singer has one of the most beautiful strong voice out right now! You cant compare to Mary J or even Patti...but if Keyshia keeps its coming like this...then she wiLL be up there in a few years!==Tasha
4,A Solid Debut,"Keyshia Coles reminds me a lot of Mary J. Blige. She is young but her voice goes beyond her years. You can feel the pain she feels on this CD that even the casual listener would appreciate. From ""I Just Want It To Be Over"" to ""Love"" and back to ""I Should Have Cheated"" you will feel her. I look forward to what Miss Cole has to offer for years to come."
2,Disposable Female R&B Singer.,"This is why we cant get quality singers anymore because people like to hype up the average ones and overlook the great ones. This girl is so average singing over average songs talking about nothing but He Cheated, You've Changed, I should of Cheated, Im like girl shut the hell up it's not serious. She act like it's the end of the world. Talk about something else because this is depressing and uninspirng. I am so sick and tired of these medicore singers destroying R&B music which is hanging on a thin string. I'm confused, I dont understand why people like this mess. It's boring, bland, worthless, and forgetable. I am not a singer but I can tell you that Keyshia Cole need to practice more on her singing ablities because she's not that good. She tries to overdue notes she cant even hit. All she doing is screaming wasting her breath."
4,Thanks E.J.D.,"I never thought I'd purchase a Keyshia Cole cd. I heard ""I should have cheated"" and that was ok but when ""Love"" started getting airplay I didn't like it and thought nothing else about it. This is crazy but I was reading Eric Jerome Dickey's new novel ""Chasing Destiny"" and in the afterward he goes on and on about how ""off the chain"" Keyshia Cole's cd is and how he's rockin it on a daily basis. When your favorite author raves about a cd, you gotta pick it up. Thanks to EJD I'm a Keyshia Cole fan. My favorites on the cd are ""I thought you had my back"" and ""You've changed"". This cd has been in my car cd player since I bought it. I've told my friends to pick this cd up because it's worth the money. Keyshia should thank EJD for endorsing her because sales are going to go up without a doubt."
5,Now This Is Music,"This is the best cd in my collection. She sing so beautiful on her songs especially her song Love. To me Keyshia always had a beautiful voice and this album proves it. Her cd is just bangin.(I Just Want It) To Be Over 10/10I Changed My Mind 9/10Love, I Thought You Had My Back 10/10I Should Have Cheated 9/10Guess What 10/10Love 10/10You've Changed 10/10We Could Be 10/10Situations 9/10Down And Dirty 8/10Superstar 10/10Never 10/10"
4,TOO REAL,"THIS GIRL HAS A SOUL, AND SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH IT!!! SHE MAKES YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SHE IS NOT ONE TO PLAY AROUND WITH!!! THIS CD IS FIRE.... I WOULD SAY ANY WOMAN WHO NEEDS SUPPORT DURING A ROUGH TIME IN A RELATIONSHIP, MUST HAVE THIS CD!!!! THE TRUTH HURTS AND THIS CD HURTS SO GOOD."
2,Let Me Tell You The Way It REALLY Is,"First of all, I don't give a rat's behind if she was raised in a ""tough neighborhood."" Who isn't raised in a tough neighborhood these days? I'm tired of these so-called artists claiming street credibility, as if that alone makes them the ""real deal."" Um, no, it doesn't. Anyway, this CD is okay, but it gets boring at times. It really doesn't sound any diffferent than the crap that's already played on the radio. The songs could be sung by anybody, were probably written for anybody, and are forgetable. I'd be more interested in Keyshia's music if she did something different yet still enjoyable. A combination of hip-hop and jazz would've been great for her."
3,Okay album,"The album is okay but Keyshia Cole can't sing and is obviously tone deaf because she don't realize that. The beats and some of the lyrics is what hold her together. If she relied on vocals alone, she'd get boo'd off stage the way Aaliyah did at one of her concerts."
2,You People Need Some Help,"Whoever is behind Ms. Cole's management team picked the right songs to release. After hearing ""I Changed My Mind"" and ""I Just Want it To Be Over"" I really thought Ms. Cole could sang! Ummmm....I was wrong. Her lack of vocal control really turns me off to songs that may otherwise be pretty good. She simply has a very weak voice. I dunno, I may give this c.d. another try but right now I'm listening to Vivian Green and Lizz Wright's new c.d.s, so I got some good stuff! The only other song that I like on this c.d. is ""Never"". Very catchy, but 3 songs was not worth the money I spent on this. Just burn it!"
3,She alright!,Ok In my opinion Keyshia Cole really cant sing TO ME! But she have the bomb lyrics and beats so I will give her credit for that!
4,The Way it Is by Keyshia Cole,"Keyshia Cole is one of the few female singers out there that have material good enough to match their vocals. Keyshia's debut its a home run. The album opens with two of R & B's hottest singles this year, ""(I Just Want it) To be Over"" & ""I Changed my Mind"", both of which showcase Cole's impeccable delivery & undeniable talent. Elsewhere she shines on ""Guess What"" with rap-star Jadakiss & blows fans away with ""I Should Have Cheated"" & ""Love"", two of the album's many ballads. My favorite track would definetly be ""You've Changed"", Cole's cover of Jay-Z's ""Song Cry"". This track is currently in the lead for my favorite song of the entire year. The only thing that made this album better was the fact that I was able to get it for $7 at Target. Don't let the low price fool you, this album is great."
3,It's like that and that's the way it is,"Keyshia Cole has slowly attracted a large following and I admit that this album is good. Her voice is rough around the edges but it's not as bad as, say, Fantasia (whoa, there goes my ""helpful vote""). ""I've Changed My Mind"" is hot as well as ""I Should've Cheated"", even though both songs are overplayed. However, my favorite song is ""Down and Dirty"". The album falters with ""Love"", ""Superstar"" and the song from Barbershop 2, ""Never"", which uncreatively samples Luther Vandross' ""Never Too Much""."
1,Nice...,"This girl can blow. Her voice is so sensuous and soulful. And, she puts so much of herself into every song. This album is wonderful. I'm just wondering from the content of her album, was she one of those girls who got passed around on the block? One of those door-kob chicks where almost any who wanted to got a turn? Cuz it sounds like she got ran on in her day. Just a curiousity. Anyway, like Kanye said (i'm paraphrasing here) ""It was those wrongs that helped her write her songs"" and come up with her album. Good job on your album , girl. Good job!!!!!!!!"
5,This girl is on fireee!,"Keyshia's album is blowing up! This girl is so popular here in Philly its crazy. Almost everyone at my school has this album, I hear it blasting in peoples cd players and ipods everyday in class and even on the public bus! So I had to check this girl out to see what all the hype was about. Lemme tell you this girl can sing, I love this cd, I love her vocals, so raw and gritty and she hit some pretty high notes. Keyshia definitely will be here for a while, she has the staying power & talent."
4,EXCELLENT DEBUT ...,I REALLY LIKE KEYSHIA COLE'Z VOICE.. I MEAN SHE CAN SING...AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT TRACK.. I CHANGED MY MIND.. I JUST HAD TO GET THIS ALBUM... I MEAN SHEZ GONNA BE A BIG STAR IN THE FUTURE....
4,Grounded and easy but still comrehensive thoughts,"about colors and chakras and their meanings. References to diseases from homeophatic view. Introduction to writer's self developed homeopathic color remedies. I found this as good first-step to colors, which are examined from physical, emotional etc. ways. This would also give new ideas for homeopaths !"
3,Let There Be Light,"Book arrived in good shape. It was an older book that what I was expecting, but I can make use of it."
5,GREAT!!!!,It was GREAT!!!! It has all he greats and it gets you in the mood for the season. All of the singers are #1 in the latin world and beyound.
5,Great as a dog bowl!,"I purchased 3 of these casserole dishes. I use them as water bowls for my dogs because my dogs don't like to drink out of plastic or metal, and the ceramic bowls break too easily. These are perfect, even to use outside. I can put them in the dishwasher and have no smells that the dogs don't like. By the way - I have two dogs, and the third dish is for me to cook with."
2,It's not corning,"Disappointed but...I don't intend to cook in it anyway. I lost my original bowl when I shared some pasta with a neighbor. I like the shape for storing and salads. It seems heavier than my original. I won't purchase another Corning French White. Just remembered, I ordered the 1-1/2 quart size...sorry."
4,A terrific place to start!,"This is a wonderful book if you have little or no knowledge of German and want to get your feet wet. This book explores all of the basics to get someone well on their way to understanding German. However, this book will not teach you in-depth knowledge of German; it will only provide you with a good beginning."
2,good for very young students only,"I bought this book and returned it because I was so disappointed in the content. It's very simple and has very little content. It has stickers for you to stick all over to help you learn the words, but this method of learning did not interest me. It might be good for young students who are learning German, though."
4,Super way to learn,"After purchasing this book I took a college course - guess what, this book was the curriculum. Excellent book with lots of pictures and many engaging exercises."
2,Disappointing CD-ROM,"In early September I will be taking a motorcycle trip around Germany and norther Italy. I wanted to ""brush up"" on my two years of college German. The book is fine. The CD-ROM has no sound and, surprise ! It is partially in RUSSIAN ! The phrases are printed on a little strip ccessed by the CD with the phrase, ""Ich mochte"" and the pronunciation - nothing else. No Englis translation. It relates to absolutely nothing. I'm just gonna have to make do with the book which, incidentally, is quite good.jamie adlerjiadler@aol.com"
2,It is just Alright,"I bought the book because I was trying to learn German from scratch and with a busy lifestyle 10 minutes a day sounds great. At first I enjoyed it, but then I started realizing that this is mainly about repetition. I felt like I was trying to memorize a translation book. The book says it comes with interactive sticky notes, but some of the sticky notes do not make sense when it comes to labeling things. For example how am I supposed to label a cat, or a dog? In the book they said to be creative but I think they should have let a spot to make your own sticky labels. I think this may be a good book for learning a couple of German words, but not if you want to become fluent in the language."
2,bookbuyer,"Hi,This book was not the one it was supposed to be .... ordered three unfortunately... was without cd rom in the back.. disappointing...Sarah"
4,Worthwhile and a good value,"Bought this prior to a trip to Germany and Austria. Studied German in high school 30 years ago and this basic course brought many basics back. Practical text with great flash cards and stickers. I would recommend also getting a course that has tapes or CD, as understanding spoken German is the biggest challenge. Also see ""Just Listen and Learn German"", very practical and a good value. Guten lernen."
5,A workhorse monitor,"I agree with the other reviewer (moose) that this is a good monitor. My company uses numerous of these monitors (in pairs) for dual-monitor workstations. The bevel is thin and not distracting. Color, contrast, etc. are good for computer programming work.Can be connected to two computers via the dual-dvi inputs."
1,Hockey Puck -USELESS ON XP!!!!,"Yes, I had hope this would work on my normal XP computer.No such luck- it won't run, and it knocks out the whole computer with a black screen & freeze. I am not about to disable my firewall and not going to change registry just to run a program. Piss-poor.Don't waste your money. Too bad- Gateway had Scrabble loaded on this laptop and I can't even buy that, as it's discontinued. Anyone reading this? We would like SCRABBLE........- ;("
4,Scrabble game on CD-ROM,"I purchased this item because I love Scrabble. I had 2 previous board games and a cd-rom game that no longer would load. Although this item was advertised as ""used"" it works perfectly and have enjoyed playing this game again. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep their mind active and improve their spelling and vocabulary."
2,Bad software,"My wife likes the game. I hate being the help desk for this poorly done software. ONE - YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE CD TO PLAY. But, good luck finding a decent one where you don't. TWO - The game started playing itself all of a sudden. She plays it for 4 months, all is fine... and Raven (the computer player) is playing my wifes turn as well. Really improved her rating, but not the idea. Eventually, after searching who made this lovely game, I found the website and it's a common problem. Changed some preferences, and it's good. THREE - A week later, you play one hand (or whatever you call it in scrabble, I hate the game), and boom - windows error ""Would you like to report this error to Microsoft?""... As if that's going to do any good. Back to the user forum on the website, and I undo what I did to fix the ""play by yourself"" problem, flip some other switches and it's working again. For now anyway. I'll be dealing again next week I'm sure.BE WARNED."
5,Great child seat for your bike,Super easy to get on your bike. My son loves riding in it. Super comfortable with all the padding and the adjustable feet settings as he gets bigger. Would advise anyone with kids to get one.
5,great seat for a large child,"We got this for our three year old, who is 35 pounds. He fits in it with room to spare. It reclines backwards to allow him even more room between him and his mom, who rides with him. The feet strap in so they don't get caught in the spokes. The sides and back have openings which allow our son to look all around him. This is our first bike seat, and it wasn't cheap, but it is really, really nice."
5,Happy biking!,"The seat is very comfortable and safe. My grandson really enjoys getting to ride along with the family. There are less expensive seats on the market, but this one is secure and easy to install."
1,Rack doesn't fit all bikes,"The Blackburn rack that comes with this seat doesn't fit all bikes. Neither of our commuter bikes worked with the rack. I called CoPilot and their customer service person was extremely rude and unhelpful. Our local bike shop said that people often have to buy longer length stays to get the rack to fit. While it is understandable that it would be difficult to make a one-size-fits-all rack, it would have been nice to know the models of bikes with which this rack would fit.I hope to be able to provide a more positive review and info about a workaround when we get this sorted out."
1,Not worth the money,"CoPilot Limo Bicycle Child SeatThis seat was great... while it lasted. The rear security catch snapped off after just 18 months, which is not what I expected considering the cost. I don't think the design is great to have a flexible piece of plastic taking a lot of force. If I was buying again I'd look for something cheaper and simpler."
2,Just wasn't the right for for us!,"Although the seat itself is very well made & seems to provide all safety features needed it's a pain in the tush! It is extremely heavy on the bike, very awkward & hard to balance! I was unable to put my child in the seat without someone holding the bike still (which defeats the purpose of biking with just my children)! My son wasn't comfortable at all and basically through a fit the entire time he was in asking to get down! We were only able to keep him in the seat long enough to make it around the block once...no trail riding for us! We returned this item and are going to try a pull behind seat!"
2,Same Story Here--Worked Just Great until...,"This is a great little dehumidifier: it's quiet, nicely designed, and it draws a lot of water. At least, it did until this past Friday.We've had our Bionaire dehumidifier for a little over a year and then suddenly it simply stopped pulling in moisture.The turbine still spins and the display indicates that there is 95% humidity in the air, but there was no water in the reservoir. Not good.I've emailed their customer support and await a reply.Bill"
5,quiet and effective!,"This dehumidifier works great! I love that it is quiet. It has many options re: how long you want it to run ie: continuous, economy, or at 2 different humidity levels. I don't like that the water container does not have a handle to carry in order to empty it, but it is a small enough water recepticle that I don't mind that much."
1,Not worth the Money,Had this item for less than a year and it died. Called up the help line. They requested a receipt. We sent the receipt. Three weeks later nothing. Called up again to find out what happened. They were still waiting for the receipt. Sent it again. Three more weeks and still nothing. We had to send the receipt three times before they would honor their warranty. For the bad service and high price I would recommend looking else where. It's also very loud and useless.
2,Hydrometer 10 degrees off!,"I just purchased this product to help lower the humidity in a finished basement bedroom from 60 to 45-40. It works, and its relatively quiet, but...THE HYDROMETER IS A CONSISTENT 10 DEGREES LOWER THAN ACTUAL HUMIDITY (based on my two 'control' hydrometers).This is VERY bad, because it means that if I put the unit on the lowest setting (45-55 degrees), since the unit is reading my 60 degree room at 50, it doesn't run itself. And I DO NOT want to run it continuously, and have to manually turn it on and off...Is anyone else having this problem? I've emailed Bionaire for input on whether its possible to reset or recalibrate the hydrometer, but... based on what I've read, I'm not holding my breath...I'm going to give it another week or so, and then if it hasn't improved, or if Bionaire hasn't responded- its OFF TO THE RETURN DEPARTMENT.I'll update in a week or so to let you all know what happened..."
3,"Works with quirks (energy hog,but a dust mite killer).","I thought it was broken when the humidity readout read WAY off on the room humidity,but it seemed to readjust itself after running and having been moved around. However the purported energy saving rating is only valid for lowest setting. Otherwise it's like having a heater going. Otherwise, a good product (with no information at Bionaire website) with a 2 year warranty (limited?). However it probably costs $60. just to ship it. I used AMEX for an extended warranty if it dies at the 2 year mark.I'm on my 20th month with 6 months of use. There's also the updated BDQ25 model that costs more. Did you know that a dehumidifier will kill all the dust mites in your room if you lower the humidity enough."
5,good dehumidifier,it is pretty quiet ( compared to what exists on the market) it works correctly. We have been leaving it on all days and it works very well.
2,No quiet at all,"I need a dehumidifier in my bedroom. I called the company to find out the decible of the noise. They wound not give me a number. So I have no choice but to get one. It is loud, running like a F35, not just a 747, next to me now in my bedroom. I would need to have ear-plugs to sleep. I guess I have to continue my search. Soleus CMF-25 has a noise level of 41 db. The quietest seems to be all Japanese products. Toshiba has one that has a noise level of 33dB, RAD-100DWX. That is the best I can find now. The trouble is that it is not on US market, and I need to get a friend's help to get it from Japan. It is also much more expensive, about $300 + whatever shipping I need to pay."
1,Never Again,"In the beginning this product worked fine, collecting moisture from the air, shutting off automatically when full. After several days, the machine started rattling and eventually stopped shutting off automatically, causing a flood and water damage in the surrounding area.After several attempts. I was able to reach DealYard, who claimed there return policy was within 7 days, no matter what the problem. They suggested calling the manufacturer.The manufacturer was willing to replace the item. After the time, frustration and cost invested to replace water-damaged carpet, I just want my money back. I don't want to take another chance.I contacted Amazon, who said I had to make a written claim to DealYard through Amazon before any action could be taken. I submitted the claim. DealYard responded once again with the same 7 day return policy. Amazon has not responded.I will never do business with DealYard again. I'll think long and hard before doing business with Amazon."
5,Awesome product!,"I've owned other dehumidifiers that sound like 747's. This one is sooo quiet compared to them. There is no such thing as a silent dehumdifer, but this is as quiet as they get. When I got this my apartment was always wet. My bed and clothes always felt damp. I plugged this in and it said the humidty level in my room was 85%!!! I guess I was living in a swamp. I set this unit to keep the room at about 50% humidity and it worked great and made a huge difference. It was amazing how much water it took out of the air."
4,Highly recommend!!!,"I have read the all amozon reviews and bought this unit. We are living in a house, always feel dampy. We have a creek near by and a flat-roof on top has been making the environment worse. I turned it on, the humidity level was 86 so kept it on for a few days. WOW! I can feel and see a HUGE DIFFERENCE. I don't see any water on windows in the morning even. It seems,this unit is effective to the whole house. (Approx. 1200 sqft)The last thing we must to check is a electric bill, we haven't receive yet. other than that, I really recommend this unit. Runs quietly and does great job!"
1,Poor customer service,"Mine was purchased last July and it was broken after two months. Called the manufacturer for exchange, but they do not have the model in stock. After alsmot half a year, I am still waiting. They do recommend a new model, but I have to pay $180."
4,Horrible experience,The product is usually a good product (reason of the four stars). It does what it promises. But I bought 50 units and they have sent them one by one!!!! If you don't have the stock you should have say it.
4,The champagne of prank letter books?,"I haven't read all the prank letter collections out there, but from what I've seen I think that Sterling Huck's brand is a cut above. In general, his efforts tend to be brilliantly subtle, impressively creative, and often refreshingly innocuous as well (most of the recipients can be seen as playmates rather than victims). His voice is a compelling -- and varied -- one, and he always fleshes out his correspondence with the extra little details and digressions that make the absurd worlds he creates surprisingly plausible and vivid."
5,Great Table for Camping!,"I bought this product for my husband for Father's Day. We needed a little table to sit next to our chairs while we sit around the camp fire. It is a great table. Light weight, easily folds and stores and is very sturdy and stable. I highly recommend it! I'm thinking about buying at least one more!"
3,Three of Four = Poor Odds,"Three of the four Alps camp stools we ordered had at least one slat that was riveted on incorrectly, i.e., crookedly. Whether this is and example of poor workmanship or an assembly machine out of whack we don't know, but it does leave a bad impression. (Of course we could have returned the lot to Amazon, but it wasn't worth the time, energy, and resources to do so.)Other than the questionable quality control at Alps, the stools appear to be sturdy enough for their intended use."
5,Beautiful!,This is beautifully put together. Title song Teranga is the icing on the cake! I can listen over and over again. Excellent execution as usual. I'd like to hear more of this original style from Jon Faddis in the future! Bravo!!!
5,My favorite mic...period.,"My Sennheiser 835s are 9 years old, so understand that this review is written well past the honeymoon period. They have been tested.The first time I used then, we hooked these up and some Shure SM58s and compared them side by side. The Shures were louder, and that was enough for our lead singer to decide he wanted to use them. I wasn't as convinced because I was looking more for tone than volume.My mic collection includes EVs, AKGs, Nadys (surprisingly good for the $), an SM57, an SM58 and a few others. The 835 is the best sounding dynamic mic I have ever used or heard. It is not as loud as the Shures, but it is not hurting for volume and it delivers a much, much warmer sound. It beats everything else every time."
5,My favorite mic right now,"I am a soundman and I use these for lead vocalists, backup vocalists and to mic guitar cabinets. I love the look, feel and sound of these. I prefer these to the SM58s and 57s I also use. The handling noise rejection is excellent and you don't have to eat it unless you want to."
4,Things Are Worse Than You Think,"I mean the state of privacy in America, not the book.The author provides shocking and ""eye opening"" information about private data companies that are building dossiers on each and every one of us! But in the end I also think that the problem lies with the government's hunger for surveillance and control.I was a young girl in Nazi Germany and can still remember how we were shocked that a totalitarian state could spring up so easily in what was a free and democratic country. The problem was that we were complacent and we waited too long to recognize and challenge what was happening. I think America, my beloved adopted country, is on the same path."
5,People Should Read This Book First Before Leaving A Review,"It would most helpful and only correct if people would read this most revealing book BEFORE leaving a political commentary or review, which has nothing to do what so ever with the subject of this book. It is most misleading not to do so.This book is not about Saddam at all, but rather about frightening privacy issues that are facing Americans post 9/11 under the guise of Security and Protection for the USA.Really, do yourself a favor and read this well researched and most informative book. The author has more then done his homework. He has compiled thoroughly established facts in an understandable book that anyone, even those who DON""T take the time to read books before leaving reviews will find enlightening. This book is a most essential read for all Americans."
4,Scared? You should be!,"First, I gave this book 4 stars rather than 5 ONLY because the volume of information provided and the writing style make it a bit of a chore to slog through. That said, the information contained in this tome is genuinely frightening stuff.Between the truly sloppy practices of the commercial info brokers who buy and sell our lives (without any compensation to us) and the voracious appetite of the post 9/11 federal security apparat, it seems that we may have a lot more to fear from our ""friends"" than we do from our enemies the terrorists.Some other reviewers have complained that O'Harrow has provided us with no solution to the problem. Its true, he hasn't, but I will. Buy this book, and if it scares you enough, buy three more, and send one each to your congressional representatives under a covering letter asking them to tell you precisely what it is they plan to do to bring this exploding outrage of surveillance mania under control. Remember, they work for you, not vice-versa."
1,interesting but there's better out there,"This made for an interesting read, but there are other (many other) tech-spy books that are better."
3,not acurate,"This book tells the oft repeated propoganda idea tat everyone in america is being watched by 'big brother' since september 11th. Te eidence does not exist and this account is pure fear mongering. Not an acurate, but a very biased account."
4,Balanced But . . .,"If I could write as well as:It Can Happen Here, and It Already Is Happening, February 13, 2005Reviewer: Steve Koss (New York, NY United States)I would write the same review.I just want to add the author does not really spell out how this new information age can be misused, especially for those who do not see the value of civil liberties in more classical setting (road blocks for drunks, moranda (sp?) rights etc.He also describes the power and potential, at the same time limits of these new technologies to find terrorists who live on very modest spending - leaving it to the reader to try to figure out which it is - but as this technology evolves this may change anyway.I wonder when the FBI could not act on information from their own Minneapolis office was giving them and with porous ports, and with terrorist simply sent back to Canada to try to enter again just how effective this will be."
5,Polishing compound for... headlight?!,"I own a 17 year-old minivan, whose headlights had hazed terribly over the years. Upon reviewing products on Amazon, I came across several materials and tools whose reviewers described as containing mild abrasives. So, I checked my cabinet and found I had a bottle of Turtle Wax Polishing Compound . I had used this with great success over the years to polish our cars' finishes before putting on the final wax. I tried a small amount of Turtle Wax Polishing Compound on a corner of a headlight, and was surprised to see it clear up after rubbing and buffing. I then completed both headlights, and the difference is amazing. Took the minivan for a drive around back roads with no street lights, and for the first time in years, am able to see very well where I am going. Hate to think of all the risk I took with minimal lighting due to hazed headlight covers."
5,Great Job...,Thank you for getting my products to me quickly we are very happy with the way they where wrapped and I was very excited that they got here so fast the wife is already using the polish on her beads.Meguiar's G17216 Ultimate Compound
2,Not compatible with all devices.,"This switch works great with my desktop's 3Com 3C905TX ethernet card, but it won't communicate with the integrated Intel 10/100 ethernet port on my Toshiba Satellite notebook. I had to place a Linksys device between the two to get them to communicate.I give it 2 stars for being pretty though."
2,A bit deceptive,"This product looks like it is tailor made for a wheelchair. In truth, it is just a shoddy piece of egg shell mattress cut out from a master piece from some warehouse. You could probably get this piece cut yourself with a little investigation."
2,"Eggcrate Wheelchair Cushion With Back 18"" x 32"" x 3""","As was stated by another buyer this is very deceptive. They are not remotely the same as two I bought a few months ago, Duro-Med Convoluted Foam Chair Pads with Seat, Blue, here on Amazon and was VERY pleased; they were shipped by Global Surgical Supply. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HM34LS/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00 I was very pleased with those but needed another seat and bought from this company because the picture seat shown appeared identical. However, It is NOT the same seat at all. Duro-Med's seat has an extra 3-4 inches of dense foam under the sitting egg crate area (which does appear in the picture shown here too, but does NOT exist on the real product shipped. This seat does NOT have the additional 3-4 inch padding under the sitting layer at all and does appear to be cut from the cheaper thin egg crate top layer only."
4,Acceptable product for the price,"I read the previous reviews and decided to order this cross vise. I was hoping for something with smoother action on the handles but at the end of the day, I got something that will work and at a fair price. Like the other reviewers said, it's just doesn't have the feel of a precision instrument rather it feels like what we've come to expect from Chinese tools; a little loose."
4,Heavy vise and well made,"This vise is pretty well made, not for mill work but general drill press work. The screws have an expected amount of backlash. It does not appear to have locking screws. It is HEAVY, and that brings me to my one complaint. It is not packaged well enough for its weight. When mine was delivered, one of the threaded screw rods was damaged on the end, the apparent result of insufficient packaging and/or rough handling. I was able to file enough of the damaged rod end off to be able to thread the retaining nut on. It does require adjustments to allow it to travel smoothly. Overall pretty good for its cost."
4,work very well whiles battery lasts,"This unit would benefit from an upgrade in battery technolegy,it does an excellent job on cell mode and just as well in intercom mode.The only problem with it is without recharging, talk time is only about 2-3 hours.I may Have to buy second units to use enroute on long rides. Otherwise very good."
2,short battery life,"This works really well when it works, but I can't wait to throw it out.I've used it for over a year now, and I had 4 different intercoms before this one. It's by far the best in sound quality and ease of use.The problem is that you only get to talk for the first few hours of each day. It doesn't seem to help to try to turn it on and off every time you need to speak, (which is difficult to do anyway). With a removable battery so that you could carry extras this device would be really excellent, but as it is, the better it works, the more annoying it is when it suddenly stops working.The product description says 10 hour battery life. That is just wrong. We have two of these and we charge them all night on our trips. We get about four hours out of them with very conservative intermittent use.Maybe they are good for answering your phone on the way to work, but they are no good as an all day travel intercom."
2,MC Helmet Bluetooth,Affordable easy install. Difficult to hear over 30mph. Mic is great other party can hear at higher speeds. Unit will only work with one bluetooth. Can't use cell phone and GPS together.
2,BlueAnt motorcycle intercoms,"I purchased two BlueAnt motorcycle helmet intercom systems. I'm having a problem with being able to make out what the other person is saying at speeds above 30 MPH. It sounds like they are talking under water. Have tried several different things but no luck. I will be contacting the BlueAnt technicial support group next. Not real happy with them at this time. Might be a simple fix, but for what they cost they should work much better then they do."
2,"good sound, but not good enough product","i bought my interphone and it worked just fine like one or two monthsbut then i started having some troubles with the batteries. It started to sound like battery went down, but the intercom continued to work fine till the end of the day. Now, no matter how many times i charge it, its always beeping like the battery is down.But the real problem i had was with the mic. The mic stays in place with two little plastic strings that after like 6 months broke, and left the mic holding in place with just the wires. Sooner or later it was going to happen. Wires broke and mic was disconnected.For a 100$ just 6 months working... not such a good dealBy the way, now i have a midland bt rider... and it really have a worst sound quality but it seems to be a more quality manufactured product"
3,Charlie`s Angels,It`s a beautiful cd. Full with great music from all kinds of artists. All from heavy rock to no stress music. I recomend this album to a ordenery music listener who likes all kinds of music
3,Big Lebowski shirt,"I thought the t-shirt would have some more to it, but it was one of those t-shirts that look like a tuxedo shirt. It would of been better if the name on it was THE DUDE."
1,Good idea; bad execution and design,"The idea behind this t-shirt is great. I would love to have a realistic replica of the bowling shirts used in the Big Lebowski. Unfortunately, this is far from being even a bowling shirt, let alone the bowling shirt from the movie.The words ""Team Dude"" detract from the realism and the value of this shirt, and what's worse is the fact this is not even a bowling shirt. It doesn't have a folded collar, it doesn't have buttons, nor embroidery. It's just a cotton t-shirt with a print of a bowling shirt design on it. This great idea was done so horribly that I would be too embarrassed to own it, let alone wear it.If they scratch the words ""Team Dude,"" make it a real bowling shirt, and price it at $40 or less, they'll have a product I'd buy."
1,Works well unless you need one specific feature,"Appears to be feature-rich at first glance, but if you are like me, and need to SPOOF YOUR MAC ADDRESS with your ISP because they have your computer's MAC address in their database DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER. The MAC Spoofing feature does not work, and it causes the unit to be unable to obtain an IP Address from your ISP, and thus you cannot get online.UNIDEN technical support is open 24/7, but the person who took my call could care less to be working there. I was not walked through any kind of extensive testing or troubleshooting procedure. The only thing suggested was to press the reset button. After that failed, it was suggested I RMA the unit.I will be taking the tech's advice, however, I will not be getting a new unit. I will be getting my money back"
3,ENR 1504 is great for a hub,"Do not have a cable modem or DSL but bought Uniden's ENR1504 because wanted to experiment with it on home network. Upgraded firmware, downloaded from Uniden website, without any problems. Currently using it as a four port 10/100 Mbps hub and it works great."
1,YUCK!,"When I heard the original apothesis, I thought that this CD would rock the world. I didnt. This CD is probably one of the worst CD's I have ever heard in my life. Complete lack of rythm, and beat sensitivity. DONT BUY THIS EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!"
3,FrontPage2003,"Not very good. They ""forgot"" to add the folders needed for the lessons, and you have to take the time to go to the website and download them. I am STILL trying to find the data base they said could be accessed from the download site. Some of the lessons assumed you knew absolutely nothing(which is ok, that is what the lessons are for), but, in others, assumed you knew far more than you did, and had to hunt around trying to find what the heck he was talking about! Very frustrating in that sense, all lessons should be on the same level."
5,small size but worth buying,This is a small book but lots of learning will come from it. There are so many things to point out to your child on each page. Maurie Manning did a wonderful job illustrating each page. It's a nice size to carry in the car.
5,Another great Boynton book!,"We have almost all of Sandra Boynton's books. They are fun to read and also educational. This one starts with a lonely hippo who calls another on the phone and progresses to a large party and back down to ""one hippo, alone once more, misses the other forty-four."" A great book! Our kids would ask questions about why the hippo was lonely and how they fit so many hippos in one house. Her books and illustrations are fabulous!"
5,Family Favorite,"Read this book so often to the kids that the binding started falling apart and the book had to be put away. Was out of print for a bit, so am happy to be able to buy new copies for grand kids to enjoy and carry on a family tradition."
5,A boynton classic!,"Our household has many Boynton books, this one is our 3 year olds favorite at the moment. If you aren't familiar with the book, it starts off, ""One hippo all alone...calls two hippos on the phone"". It goes on until theirs a big party at the hippo's home. It's hilarious. Not only does mom and dad enjoy readying it, our daughter loves hearing it as well as looking at all the pictures. My daughter now counts out the hippos on the pages and tells me about them (like the hippos that come overdressed). If you don't have this one, get it and add it to your collection."
5,One Hippo All Alone... a back and forth counting book,"A wondrous counting book that tells of a lonely hippo who calls two others on the phone. Then larger and larger groups keep arriving (three though nine) until all 45 hippos and the beast (a guest of one of the groups) go berserk and party all through the hippo night. But at the hippo break of day, they all begin to go away (nine through two) until all that is left is the original one.Most counting books only count in one direction. This fun book counts up and then back down again (although it doesn't use zero). It even makes mention of how many they add up to.Typical Boynton illustrations add to the fun of this book."
5,Another great Boynton book,"We have lots of Ms. Boynton's books and all of them, including this one, are excellent. This one is one of my favorites."
3,Good book,This book is cute but it is not as good as some of the other board books for little ones offered by this author. It's just okay.
5,Amazing,"I love this book. It is really hard to find where I live. I remember my father reading it to me when I was around nine years old and I have been looking for it ever since he left. You can bet I am buying it. I always remember this one line... ""take with you my love. My one love. My only love."" I love this book!"
5,A Wonderful love story,"As the previous reviewers have gone over everything I was going to say...all I can say is ..run don't walk to read this book. This is an amazing love story between two lonely people. One willing to take a chance and marry without love the other scarred from a fire that took the love of his life, lonely thinking he could never love again. This book had me in tears again..Ms. Grasso knows just what heartstrings to pull. You get to read about Samantha, Rudolph again plus those crazy Kazanov brothers and Isabelle and JamesThis is the first book in her new series about the Kazanovs."
1,Horrible,"This was my first book by this author and will be my last. It was horrible to say the least, the hero if you can call him that was rude, mean, insensitive, i could go on and on but I think you catch my drift.And every time he was cruel to the heroine he then offers a simple apology and is off on his way and the heroine just keeps taking it.I read other reviews to this book before i purchased it and one person wrote how the author really knows how to pull at your heartstrings - my response to that is read - Catherine Anderson, Anne Gracie just to name a few."
5,Primera black ink cartridge - Right on the mark...,"This cartridge is designed to function with a printer that's integrated to a Discmaker's CD/DVD duplication unit that I've been using consistently every week for the last eight years - The printer is obviously the final step in the duplication process that prints a text file of my choosing to be printed on the face of the blank media. Literally hundreds of copies are produced every year with just one cartridge per year meeting the task - Like most OEM cartridges these cartridges are a bit pricey but, once again, you get what you pay for - I would highly recommend this cartridge to anyone in a heartbeat...Sincerely,J.T."
2,Beautiful but Broken,"I was excited to receive this mug yesterday, as it was on my birthday wish list. When I opened the package, the first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful look of the mug. That leather wrap-around is a classy touch.Quite unfortunately, the second thing I noticed was that the handle was not attached to the mug at the top. The bottom part of the handle looked as if it would fall apart at any second. It appeared both were attached via glue only.I hope to have better results exchanging it than another commenter did. However, this was the very first package I received from Amazon with no labels of any kind inside. I am counting on still being able to exchange it. Worst case scenario, if the return doesn't work, I'll try supergluing the handle back onto the mug."
4,"Well made, look great",Doesn't keep drinks as hot as my mug with a sipping cover but it looks very nice and is better than an ordinary coffee mug.
5,A REALLY COOL video!!,In addition to this program being a video it is also a tv show. I first saw the eppisodes on this tape on tv. I especially like the eppisode(which I saw in late 96 or very early 97) about the family who have ghosts in their house and how they deal with it. It is SO interesting!! I highly reccomened this video!!
2,wet hair,"I give this two stars because it looks cool. I bought it with high hopes of keeping my long hair dry, but it didn't work. I bought a one-size fits all, and it creeps up a little in the front/back. I don't know if any of these caps really keep hair dry or not - that's why I was trying to read reviews."
4,Corgis Adventures,"'The Courageous Corgi' is a delightful story about Ramsey and his adventures from Wales to America. I enjoyed reading about his trials, tribulations, heartbreak and joy that he endured and especially his mischieveous situations he & his brother would find themselves in after they both found each other and then their 'forever home'. I am also pleased that Ms. Herrick would share a portion of her proceeds with animal rescue organizations."
4,The Courageous Corgi,"A cute quick read. Given that it is a childrens book, I wasn't expecting too much depth. I definitely had my heartstrings tugged & rooted for the main character all the way through. Any dog lover would enjoy it. Corgi lovers gotta read it!"
4,Sweet and heartfelt,"For any dog lover -- young or old -- ""The Courageous Corgi"" is a charming book. The writing is not polished, but Ms. Herrick's love for her corgis shines through clearly. She captures the spirit of these little dogs very well, letting the reader participate in their triumphs and tragedies. I read this book with one of our own corgis curled up next to me and enjoyed the story even more."
5,"Run, don't walk to buy this book!","My local librarian ordered this book and suggested it to me. Having never heard of letterboxing I was instantly hooked. The book is well written, comprehensive, and inspiring. My life as I knew it is over.I have bought a number of copies to give away to friends and family as I know that they will become hooked too, so that way we can still do something together, hunting for letterboxes!For more info you can check out www.letterboxing.org and they tell you all about it too, but the book is just really special."
4,The Letterboxer's Companion,"Good material to get you started. Very good reading for the beginner. However, this book will soon be sitting on the shelf as it has no advanced information. Still, worth the purchase."
3,I expected more,"The book was much smaller than I expected. Read it cover to cover in an hour or so. Good information, though no real revelations. Kind of spendy for such a small book."
2,Not for Everyone,"This stuff burns my skin. I'm sure it works for some but it is obvious that it is too strong for me. If you know your skin is sensitive, try something else."
3,A little disappointed,I didn't find the arrangments that satisfaying .. these are a bit too simplified .. but then it is for easy piano ..
3,Don't let mom hear this one!,"I'm not easily shocked, but a few years ago when this popped up on a techno compilation I bought, I was mortified! Not that I personally was offended, but I couldn't believe that a kid could buy this and hear it! I won't even play it loud enough for the neighbors to hear. It is pretty filthy, but if you want to get the man in your life going, give him a call and put this on for him to listen to! He'll be home in 5 minutes! haha! Other than the lyrics, though, I actually like the song. Beware if you don't want explicit, sexual (very) content."
3,Good,I like this book and use it at my day job. Many of the people I work with enjoy it however dont really get a good understanding of thier own shame and embarrassment. This book is good for those a little more in touch with thier feels.
4,good on behavior/ bad on tracking.,"The chapters on animal behavior are excellent and truly some of the best i've read. This in itself is well worth the money. However the begining chapters of the book that deal with tracking are rather primitive, and designed for only the true beginner. It states things like ""the sex of the animal cannot be determined by the tracks"", but any semi-experienced tracker knows this to be false."
4,I liked it!,"I really did enjoy this DVD... I have to agree with the person who said it was a bit cold, but watching preformances on tv will never be the same as watching live prefromances. I got this DVD the day after I saw the Bellydance Superstars prefom live on stage and they were amazing, but I still wasn't disappointed watching them on the DVD.I'd also like to reiterate that the DVD was filmed with 2 different camera angles... one with close ups, and one with full body frames. All of the people who are complaining that the constant changing of camera angles gives them a headache need to change the camera angle on their DVD player (mine is a button on the remote that looks like a movie camera) and try watching it with the full body camera angles. You won't be disappointed.I think this DVD was very well done and worth every penny."
2,Dull,"I love the Live in Paris DVD and the first DVD was already. This one I found a bit dull. On paper it sounded great with Issam doing more solos with the dancers. But it just didn't capture my attention, not even with accompanied by an oud player.The only thing that was mindly interesting was the short interviews in the special features section."
1,"Couldn't watch it., but not because of the dancers","I was so looking forward to this dvd, but after just one minute of constant rapid camera edits, I had to turn it off. Its like other reviewers have said, the editing is awful. Sad."
4,Instant Classic,"The bellydance superstars have helped pave the way for a whole genre of bellydance DVDs. This collection isn't perfect, but it is certainly worth owning. As other reviewers, the editing is annoying, but the performances are lovely in the ""superstar"" style."
4,Better than I thought,"I was not going to purchase this DVD due to some of the reviews saying it was not that great. I went ahead and purchased it and watched it last night, and really liked it! The lighting is nice, the bellydancers are beautiful with wonderful outfits and wonderful dance moves. Overall I think it is a good DVD to add to your bellydance dvd library. There are many good performances and performers in this dvd. Try it!"
3,"Great Performances,Poor Production","I can't believe it,great talented dancers, beautiful performances,bad production.I've been video and photo graphing dancers for years. do not consider myself a ""professional"" but i know I could do better, i have done better.Miles Copeland backed this production. In the past i've come to expect better quality from his organization. the director and camerman do not understand dancers, too maney errors to mention here. the DVD finalization production was poorly done,gross error in chapter 18.I'm a professional DJ/VJ and have pro equipment in my home.I have charted the bit flow of the disk even that is not up to standards. i could not believe, the results so i asked Amazon for a replacement disk it came the results were the same.This is to mister Copeland, Please do this again, only better."
1,Do Not buy Nokia HS-4W,I bought the Nokia HS-4W Boom HeadsetThis Nokia Headset is horrific.I use the Nokia 6230The headset disconnects/loses its connection with the phone all the time so when the phone rings I have to answer from the phone since the ear piece just won't respondVoice recognition only works if I touch a key on my cell phone.It lowers the volume of the phone automatically by half when it does respond.Sometimes it even produces some horrific noise.In conclusion DO NOT BUY this product.
2,sound to low for outside use,"Item works great indoors but the sound is too quiet, I thought about having my hearing checked but after reading other reviews I learned its not just me. I work in building construction with lots of loud noises and can't hear unless I press it unconfortabally into my ear. Do not recomend"
3,Clear in the ear but bad for the other guy,"I really liked how the Nokia sat on my ear and didn't move around. It was clear to listen to but sounded fuzzy to the other person. After leaving myself a couple of messages to hear how I sounded, it went back to the store. C'est la vie."
2,Poor audio quality,"I am happy with this product with one exception: It needs more volume. I have good hearing but this thing is hard to hear. If I have to keep pressing it in to my ear, what good is it? I would not recommend buying this thing unless you only want to look stylish because you won't be able to hear anything unless it is dead quiet outside."
5,Great End-Times Study for Beginners,"Many books on end-times prophecy are over the average reader's heads. Either this, or they make great leaps in deduction from one thought to another, leaving the reader confused about how they got from one place to the next. This book is written at a level that most Christians can understand - walking the reader step by step through the basics of end-times prophecy. A great introduction to the study of the rapture. This book, which is endorsed by Sola Scriptura ministries, is destined to become a classic book on the prewrath rapture alongside books like Rosenthal's The Pre-Wrath Rapture of the Church, Van Kampen's The Rapture Question Answered: Plain & Simple, and Nigro's Before God's Wrath: The Bible's Answer to the Timing of the Rapture."
3,cheaply constructed,"Parts snapped together poorly, but is 'functional.' Expected a little bit better quality, so I guess I got what I payed for. For three dollars more,the other one I purchased was much better."
5,Wonderful,After taking a clinic with Anthony I went to the library and found this book.It was the same patterns we had used int he clinic.They worked wonderful for the young horse we had in the clinic and with my older and more experianced hunter.These methiods will work for any horse.
1,Quality has slipped in recent years,"We bought a single Savvy for our daughter when she was born 7 years ago and we loved it. That stroller went everywhere with us, through every kind of condition, and held up beautifully. The twin savvy started falling apart as soon as we got it out of the box. The clips on the straps broke, the bar pops off, and the hinges on the umbrellas are so flimsy that they bend if you try to use them. This stroller is made very cheaply and you'll find that out quickly as soon as you use it. The recline on the seats is not very far so sleeping children can not truly recline. The one drawback on the single Savvy was the small and inaccessible basket and that holds true here, as well.I used to tell people to buy Combi but now I tell them to look elsewhere, especially for the money."
4,Works good,For the small stuff tha I do it does a great job. Had to take it all apart and clean the greece offnext I used DuPont Teflon chain saver wax based lube and that made everything move easier
4,cross vise,It is ok but fust a little loose. When you go by the setting you have made and need to come back there is too much play.
2,Serious problems and a bit pricey for what it is,"The vise itself is quite well constructed for this type of item. The jaws seem to be flat and parallel, and the clamp works smoothly. The cross-slides are quite rough, though tolerable for this class of product; with some polishing, they could be quite smooth. The biggest problem is the leadscrew nut on the lower axis. It is simply inserted (not press-fit) into a hole in the slide, and it is very loose, with about 0.1"" of play. This makes it useless for almost any operation that demands tighter tolerances. On top of that, one of the handles has a hole that is at an angle to the machined bearing surface, and this causes severe binding if the handle is tightened. This causes another 0.1"" of play.Most of these flaws could potentially be remedied with some modifications. But I was expecting this item to be higher in quality.In short: save your money and buy one of the half-price versions of this. You won't be missing much."
2,"Bad metal, easily breaks.","I learned too late that the construction of this machine involved some kind of really cheap pot metal or similar. It wasn't more than two weeks of use when I went to cinch a metal rod into her when the metal holding the two vice pads together SNAPPED simultaneously straight in two on both sides! They were pulled cleanly apart along a perfect vertical line. Steel doesn't do that. Neither does iron. Anyway, it's completely useless now and thank goodness for Amazon's legendary customer service."
1,Utter muck,"I know this play well, and I'd guess half the plays. I have several versions of the major plays on video and DVD, and of course various copies of the text, some just for the particular editor's introduction. This is one of the silliest and poorly acted Shakespeare productions I've ever seen (and I've seen plenty). It's been months but I still regret wasting time (see the scene in Pomfret castle for reference) watching it. I don't want to waste more time saying why this production is [...], but the mercilessly bad acting should be enough to make anyone get bored within minutes."
1,Incredibly bad!,"How this video was ever released professionally is beyond explanation. The acting is well below any decent college production and renders Shakespeare's magnificent language utter undecipherable; the editing and direction are clumsy and inept, and the photography varies wildly from shot to shot, all the way from picture postcard pretty to low-level out-take quality... in fact, everything about this video is embarrassingly bargain basement. If you're not either a hopelessly naive novice or personal friends of someone associated with the production, you're in for a dreary experience here, because this piece is so bad, it's not even worth laughing at."
1,sound as if the cast is speaking in a barrel,"Poor sound, I actually looked for sub-titles as I only understood one word in four. Poor acting and the focus of the film is soft and grayed in color. DON""T BUY! I gave it one star as that is the lowest rating possible, but it should be a minus rating."
4,Best cam out there for the $$$.,"I don't have any need to lie about this camera. I don't work for Amazon or Vivitar or do I care much about their sales. This camera takes pictures bigger than your screen. It's amazing and it has a lot of flash power. The batteries drain somewhat fast, so get some rechargeables. It's amazing, try it out. I got one and I'm so glad to toss the old ""Web""cam.Update: Batteries draining so fast is gettting very annoying! There needs to be a A/C adaptor."
4,"Great pictures, strange controls","The indoor and low light picture quality is perfect. Outdoor light is more than the camera can handle and generally washes out, so it can't do flower beds. The lense cover is linked to a switch so that it is in camera mode when open, viewing mode when closed. I found myself constantly opening and closing the cover. Sometimes the camera will not respond to the cover unless turned off and on to reset. The options are seperated into a ""setup"" selection on the function wheel and a ""menu"" button, which is annoying. Someimes, generally in bright light when the lense needs to stop down, the camera makes a clicking noise. I fear that the clicking noise may be a sign of a defective shutter on my camera. All in all, it is a comfortable camera that can be used hard and does not feel ... even though it is."
2,Not a good catch,I brought this camera for my bithday and I had a blast with it. The pictures were great and everything. It was even used for my school newspaper! But unfortunatrely it does this glitchy thing while taking a picture and sometimes in order to take a see your pictures you have to take a picture first. The camera freezes a lot meaning you have to shut it down manually which is bad for the camera. I don't recommend this camera unless you have a rechargeable pack of PATIENCE!
5,Listen Up!,"There couldn't be a better title for this book. Each essay begs you to ""listen up"" and listen good. The women in this book focus on all areas of feminism, and their feminist experiences at different times in their lives. Some are about trying to reconcile their circumstances with their feminist ideals, such as the feminist aerobics instructor, or the feminist who nearly had to become a go-go dancer just to pay the rent. My favorite essays were the ones that focused, at least in part, on what it's like to be growing up now, in a time where all too many people think that feminism is dead and/or dying. I have too many favorites to begin listing them here, but I definitely recommend this book to any one who is a feminist (no matter your age); think you might be a feminist, but don't want ""that label""; or if you adamantly aren't a feminist, but you know one. I don't think any one will regret buying it."
5,Contemporary feminist perspectives on women's issues,"Now in an expanded second edition, Listen Up: Voices From The Next Feminist Generation showcases an outstanding series of essays by leading ""third-wave"" feminists on an impressive range of topics such as blending careers with feminists politics; the inability of a singular feminism to speak for all women, the intersection of traditional culture and third-wave sensibilities; feminist activism; sexuality; identity, gender formation, and more. Ably edited by feminist and women's issues expert Barbara Bindlen (Managing Editor, Family Fun magazine), Listen Up is a core addition to any academic and community library Women's Studies collection, and very strongly recommended reading for women seeking to learn contemporary feminist perspectives on important and principle women's issues of the day."
3,Average,"Well I am a multimedia student with only 2 months of Premiere Pro experience under my belt. This is a great program, and I enjoy using it and will continue to use it. Classroom in a book is what they gave me for my textbook at my college, and though it shows a newbie like me how to use the interface of Premiere Pro and some of it's cool features, I also found errors in the book that were so obvious. When I was working on chapter 6, I was supposed to use the zigzag effect and when I tried to complete the chapter I found that there was no zigzag effect in this version. There is no excuse for this kind of error. However my college publishes their textbooks through a third party publisher, who will remain nameless, that are absolutley horrible, so I'm glad I got Classroom in a Book instead of the garbage that I'm normally given. If you want to learn the basics of Premiere Pro this is about as average as you can get. Try to find a better resource if you can."
1,Doesn't work on Macs,"1 star because I was unable to open the files on a Mac. 0 stars for Amazon not mentioning anywhere on this page that the DVD rom won't work on a Mac. The book is probably as great as others have said. I've had other books from these folks and they were very good. The book I received clearly says ""DVD included for Windows"" in the lower left hand corner. Try clicking on the picture of this book and enlarging: The exclusion is not there. If you have a Mac look elsewhere, I'm sending mine back."
2,Doesn't explain the how's/why's of Premiere editing,"Being new to NLE editing, I bought Premiere Pro and this book. Unfortunately, the books simply tells the user to click this, and drag that. But it does not say WHY the user is doing these actions. I could follow most of the examples in the book, but couldn't figure out how to actually use the program for my own projects! For me, I need an explanation of why I'm supposed to click/drag/type instead of a ""march-in-lockstep"" and don't ask why mentality!"
3,Some irritating flaws in the lessons,"I bought this book with high hopes and was happy with the exercises until I ran into Lesson 5. Lesson 5 covers creating ""cut-only video"". This is a MAJOR part of video editing and, unfortunately, this lesson had major errors in it (more than one). The ""in"" and ""out"" points were completely messed up and it was impossible to do the edits as instructed. Very frustrating! I ended up having to completely skip this important lesson."
4,Premiere Pro 2,"This book was required for my Videography class, but seeing as how I have Adobe Creative Suite 4, Production Premium installed on my computer and everything is CS4, this book is outdated and I cannot use it. If your class has Premiere Pro 2.0, it will be quite useful. For me it is not, but it is still well written and educationally concise."
4,Great book with lots of errors on DVD,"The book was great - especially the first 2 chapters - overview and turorial. Quite a few files on the DVD cannot be used making it quite difficult to follow the step-by-step instructions. I've sent a request to replace the DVD and did not receive any feedback from Adobe. I recommend the book to get a general idea of how to use the product. However, it can be frustrating when the 'finished movie' and sample files cannot be used."
3,I did not like this book as much as I would have liked...,"My reason for not liking this book as much, and it it's truly not a knock against the author, is that it does not explore the area of unrealized potential as deeply as I would have liked.That is the problem that I have always had the biggest issue with is that those who do exhibit gifted qualities, so often, find themselves in such negative straits because they have nowhere to place their minds or have no idea that that is what their problem is."
4,To better realize our abilities,"The author looks at a number of issues that affect how people realize their talents, or fail to do so. As a teacher of gifted teens and a writer and poet herself, she knows how important issues such as recognition, attitude and encouragement can be.In our interview (posted on my site), she comments, ""One of the biggest aspects of it is to convince yourself that you are entitled to do this, that your creativity is important... I was well into my thirties before I gave myself permission.""In the preface, she notes that many gifted adults make outstanding contributions to society, but ""there are large numbers of frustrated gifted adults who do not find outlets for their potential.""The book is a very helpful tool for those of us who have not experienced clear and certain paths to eminence, to explore some of the reasons why, and what we can do to help ourselves more fully realize our abilities."
2,Doesn't quite deliver,"Great idea to have a book on this topic. Unfortunately, I found the book to be unscientific in the theories it presents on the gifted, as well as self-congratulatory in tone. A few helpful suggestions are present, however, they are hidden in mostly junk. I think it just makes people feel good about being uppity and acting like they are better than everyone else.Nothing really that revolutionary or new here. Too bad. Especially when you consider that her intended audience (the gifted) will probably want a lot more from a book than she delivers."
1,a waste of cash,"snobby and boring. almost impenetrably mindless.... if you're looking for insight and inspiration, look somewhere else."
3,Not As Good As I Expected,"This book is a bit too anecdotal and narcissistic for my tastes. The text is filled with naval-gazing personal conjecture, self-directed inquiry and subjective opinion that, unfortunately, merely regurgitates many of the theories of pop-psychology. This book offers no real revelation of deviant giftedness, the stories told are common human stories.It might be a good book for the average reader who seeks to understand a gifted associate. . . . maybe. Or maybe I'm being generous. I really didn't care for this book, but the entire genre is lacking. You might feel compelled to buy this book because there is a stunning lack of scholarship on adult giftedness outside of the study of genius and madness. If you're gifted, don't bother, go buy a book on B.F. Skinner's Operant Social Engineering or Prussian-era compulsory schooling and feed your mind something yummy."
5,Tear drippin WONDERFUL!!!,This book made a lump in my throat the moment I read it. So amazingly beautifully rhymed. I infact still choke up a bit just writing the review;-) Get this book NOW!!!:-)
3,IF I WERE A LION I WOULDN'T BUY THIS BOOK,"A WILD, YOUNG GIRL IS IN TIME-OUT & TALKS ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS THAT ARE WILD COMPARED TO HER. CHECK THIS OUT FROM THE LIBRARY BEFORE BUYING IT. I'D RECOMMEND 'BAD CAT' INSTEAD."
1,IF I WERE A LION,I guess i should have done a little more research on this book before bying it. It is more for a 5 year old. It has maximum of 15 words per every 5 pages. My daughter looked at it once and set it aside. Again not sure if it says what age range its for but definitley not for a 9 year old.
2,This is awful,This player is awful...because many of my wma tracks are tagged with licensing the iriver is a nitemare.....buy the samsung much better player for the money and wont lock you out of teh much smaller files wma provides
2,Avoid this like the plague!,"If you want this because it's upgradeable in the firmware, avoid it like the plague!I tried to upgrade mine to the latest firmware from a download at the iRiver site. I followed all of the instructions which include first formatting the unit and now my player won't work no matter what I try to do.I'm out $150! The return policy and procedure at Amazon is vague. There is no phone number to contact Amazon to find out if my unit would be received. Trying to do anything through e-mail is like a turtle trying to win the Daytona 500!Man! What a bad experience! I don't believe I'll be buying anything else from Amazon...for one reason only: no phone number to their customer service dept."
2,"Not so perfect, as of yet anyway...","Ok, so I just received the player in the mail and right off the bat, I started noticing problems: first I had an incredibly hard time opening the battery door, it's as if iRiver wants to keep a secret in the compartments or something (I had to use a piece of rubber to press against the door to open it). Then the earphones...for the longest time I couldn't figure out why the right one was longer than the left one. My biggest gripe though, was with tech support: I called the number (1800-399-1799) about 5 or 6 times and everytime all you would hear was a busy signal. So I tried the internet, which answered my earphone question. However, I just registered the player today, and on the page where it offers various links to more info and FAQs on the iFP-190T, all of those links gave me a 404 Error-page cannot be found. What the F*ck?! I mean, to my understanding this is a ""good"" product, but if the support sucks ass, then what's the use of having it?"
2,Weak products,"I do not have this specific i-river product, but I have purchased two of their products in the past and the quality of both began to deteriorate within months. Both of them damaged numerous sets of headphones, wearing the connectors to the point that only one earpiece would work. On one of my players the backlight on the LCD stopped working, and on the other the connection between the player and the USB chord no longer holds properly, preventing me from changing any of the MP3's on a 64 MB player. When I contacted the company about these problems they gave me the good ole runaround, basically vouching for the poor qaulity of their products. I will not being buy any of their products again."
1,Worst Trash Ever,"This has been my worst purchase ever! Highly Difficult downloading. Must has Windows98SE or better, forget about Windows98 users. The only good part is the radio. Assembled in China, should actually cost $25 dollars or less. Not worth buying, thank goodness the store I've purchased it from refunded my money."
2,I did not get headphone in the package. Any one else who did,Very surprised to see that headphone was missing. Tried calling 800-399-1799 more than 10 times but got busy signal. One time got thru but gave up after holding for 4o mts. No body came on the line.
3,Too delicate,I bought this model in June 2003 for about $200. Loved it. 5 days after the warranty expired [June 2004] the entire bottom [where the battery is inserted] fell off pulling the red power wire out of the circuit. The little plastic tabs that hold the 2 screws for the cover sheered right off. Very flimsy. iRiver customer service had no suggestions for repair. I guess it's safe to assume they're built to last about a year.
4,"Nice little player, but limited file space","I bought the IFP-190T for a recent trip to Europe. A few comments...Positives+ I like that you could remove the battery, which was key for the travels on the plane and on the Eurail. I considered getting an iPod mini, but didn't want to lug a charger around Europe.+ The battery lasts forever! I changed it maybe two times for my entire two-week trip.+ The tiny size+ You can adjust pretty much every little detail on the player. The backlight come on too long? You can change it.+ It worked flawlessly the entire trip, and still works great.+ The sound quality is excellent.Negatives- The 256MB size is hard to deal with. I ended up get Easy CD_DA Converter and shrunk my MP3s so more could fit.- Getting my Dell computer to initially recognize the iRiver player took some time and research.- I don't like the iRiver Music Manager, but you can use the 190T drag-and-drop hard-drive style trhough some updates."
3,"Oh, so close to being perfect","There is a lot to like with this unit - the user interface is very intuitive, the audio performance is superb, and the look is sleek.But...It fails on a couple of very important areas for me (recognizing I am very particular)1) The USB1 is a bit too slow for me2) It does not interface with MS Media Player. For me, that means that all the playlists I've built for workouts etc are useless.3)The software they bundle is a bit clunky, especially with WMA files.If these things don't bother you, this is a sweet little unit."
2,Good at first until dropped,The menu is unbelievable. Having 4 lines of text display you always know what is going on. All the buttons are easy to use and the menu options are numerous. This was no doubt the best mp3/wma player ever. You can make folders within the player. I created a folder for every album I had on the player so you could just change album folders instead of cycling through tons of songs. But I dropped mine and the battery compartment door broke. Then it slipped again and the navigation button got destroyed. My friend also had one and the on button quit working because he used it too much. If you want a great player go to iriver.com and look at the new designs they seem to be more rugged but with the same button design so your on button might quit working if you use it too much.
4,Great Quality!,"I got this mp3 for my birthday and I have to say, it's great! It only holds about 40 of my songs, but that might just mean my songs are too big. The sound quality is great and it's light and compact. I highly recommend it."
1,"Looked good, but lacked quality","After I finally figured out how to work all buttons in the right combination, the thing up and quite working. I'm glad that Apple has improved their products. We have two of them and I also have a Sony MP3 player. iRiver needs to make a better product. This one lacked durability and thoughtful design."
2,An update to my previous review...erm...complaints,"For history please refer to my previous review.So far, Amazon has performed admireably. iRiver, on the other hand, has not.Amazon has done everything they said they would do, they have been very kind, responsive and efficient. iRiver has just, this day, responded to my concern. I e-mailed iRiver a week ago.I told Amazon that I wanted to return the replacement MP3 player they quickly sent me because I didn't want anything to do with iRiver. The length of time that passed before iRiver customer service responded to my concern tells me they don't care about the consumer. I won't reward that attitude.Amazon has responded to my concerns within 24 hours of submitting them. I submitted several. iRiver, apparently, couldn't find the time to help me."
4,Good product,I enjoy my new MP3 player and also like the radio option. It works well and sounds great.
3,Can I buy a armband of this product,"I am not sure I can buy a armband or use a armband for this product. I only saw iFP-195T has this option.If anyone knows, please tell me. Appreciate!"
2,Grossly Overpriced & Horrendously Engineered,"While the iFP-190T is impressively compact, looks nice, and sounds reasonably decent, the controls and functionality were apparently designed by an incompetent madman with an evil sense of humor. The users manual is slightly more than worthless and the device itself is less intuitive than a box of cereal. Learning to navigate is a matter of painful trial & error. The Music Manager software that comes with the device is cumbersome and amazingly limited. Also, for reasons passing understanding, iRiver does not support MusicMatch downloads. In summary, the iFP-190T is an ill-conceived, poorly executed, absurdly expensive doorstop."
1,Read the other reviews!!!,"iRiver gives you a one year warranty and it WILL break after that one year. Contacted their customer service for repair options. They said, essentially: ""drop dead"".Same problem as other reviewers: these buttons break. Poor quality and poor engineering - great for a few days.You cannot do worse with other brands. Try them first!"
4,"Near perfect, wth a few flaws","I found the iRiver iFP player to be a great buy. 256mb for what, $150, how could you resist. However, there are a few small letdowns with this machine. Below I have listed the pros and cons I can recall.PROS-ample space for a great price-very simple, understandable software with USB port(For me about 5 sec. to download a song from my computer or vice versa)-sleek,small design with necband and armband-folders to organize music-takes a few days to get the hang of using it, but once you do, easy as pie-Great sound qualityCONS-Doesn't come w/ great earbuds, but their just a throw in-Does not support file types similar to those used in iTunes, which are blocked so you can't convert them-Radio reception is not great-Mike can't pick up sound from over 5 ft. awayOverall, it is a great buy for its price. Heck, I would have paid $100 more for it."
4,Good stuff,"It has a great sound and it's so little that you can take it anywhere with you. Too bad is only 256 Megs but, in a way it's all I need. I find it really usefull everytime I do the lawn at my house, ride my bike and also in the car with the tape car adapter that I had (too bad this didn't come with it, it would off be really usefull)."
3,good sound and bad interface,"I just got this player for exercising. It's small and light enough to carry around. The sound is excellent. The interface is bad, the buttons are confusing. Everytime I tried to lower the volumn, it took me to the menu. USB 1.0 is slow. But I will probably buy it again, just for the price."
1,makes you want to give up on technology all together!,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible...a crying 10-year-old and several friends with technology-related backgrounds to help and still no satisfaction. This gift was the ""Grinch that stole Christmas"" that comes with a bold insert disclaimer that says "" STOP Before you return it...call this number..."" That says it all. The Manual was written by people trying to save money on paper and printing (the only explanation for what should get the Technical Writers worse Written Award). The folks on the other end of the number were polite...but not encouraging or helpful (although they did admit to the manual's flaws) CAN'T download from LEGAL websites (this you find out after you purchase a membership online...and then Call the enclosed phone # and wait 37 minutes for a LIVE voice.) Get ready Amazon...ours is coming back!"
1,Poor service at Best Buy,"I made the mistake of buying my iFP-390T at Best Buy. I tried to exchange it after 30 days, but Best Buy refused to be helpful in any way. The customer service manager at their Gilroy store told me that they would rather lose a customer than modify their policy. Unbelievable! I should have shopped at Amazon.com!!! (The iRiver product is great!)"
1,Not for first time MP3 player buyers!!,"I'll make this really short...I had no idea going into this venture that processes such as 'encoding' and 'ripping' would need to be familiar to me. Nothing on the package, nothing from the salesstaff. Got it home, software manual lacking in a BIG way. Loaded the player up with songs and couldn't play one of them!! Neither the software nor the manual are for beginners. I am returning the item for another brand!!"
3,Not as functional as I thought.,"I bought this device primarily for the voice recording function. The voice files are recorded into a proprietary .rec file format. You are required to use their upload manager to move the files from the device to the HD and convert to .wav files. MP3 conversion isn't an option. Because of the 128 kbs recording format, an 8 minute recording converts into a 30 MB .wav file. I am required to use 1) iRiver upload manager to convert the file to .wav, 2) sndrec32.exe to convert down to 8K/8bit/mono and 3) MusicMatch to convert to MP3.It's a good device, but the functionality is very limited."
4,Really great mp3 player,"Well, I just got it yesterday and I immediately uploaded my music onto it and it was great! The music quality sounds just like my cds and I love how small and light it is! So far, nothing has malfunctioned and I hope that the buttons never stop working.The problem is that the package arrived in a half opened tattered box from amazon...that wasn't very good. Another inconvenience is that it took a long time for my Windows XP to recognize the player.Overall it's a wonderful product."
5,"Very good player for the beginner, and the advanced user.","I bought this item off of ebay for $47 shipped. I recieved it a few days later, today. What can I say? I'm very impressed. It's small, compact, and.. perfect. The buttons seem to be sturdy, along with the whole thing. I've already dropped it a few times and it's just absolutely great. I originally upgraded my firmware to UMS, but for some reason I decided to change it back. I got the wrong firm ware and really messed it up. I then formatted the drive using the software included and got it working. I'm now using the iriver music management software. I bought this as my first player and decided to use it for school, home, walking, bike rides, etc. So far, I've got about 20 songs at 128-250 bit rate quality. I honestly don't know what to say. I'm very impressed, it's a GREAT product. DO NOT hesitate to buy this!I hope this helped, honestly. IT's a great product!"
2,Owned 3 - All 3 failed with same problem - broken buttons,"I have owned 3 of these. All 3 failed with same problem - broken buttons. I am SOL with the third. Conclusion: This product (iFP- 190 T) has a very high probability of breaking and becoming useless. iRiver helped is not being very helpful with replacements.For more info, you can contact gmcjunk@yahoo.com"
3,Fine Performances In Claptrap Melodrama,"Fine performances help this otherwise silly story of a World I-era show girl whose romantic entanglements lead her to uncover a German spy ring. Harlow and Tone are acceptable in their roles, and Harlow's charisma is given full play with her singing voice believably dubbed by vocalist Virginia Verrill; Lewis Stone also stands out in a supporting role. But the film belongs to Cary Grant, who gives a truly fine performance as the reckless, philandering flying ace that Harlow loves.The first half hour or so of the film is both slow and improbable; the remainder of the film is just as silly, but with the entrance of Cary Grant, however, the film picks up steam. Most viewers will enjoy the dog-fight scenes; discerning viewers will be amused to find Harlow's 1930s gowns uneasily mixed with the WWI background. Fans of the stars will certainly want the film in their collection, but the claptrap plot reduces it to a minor effort that few others will enjoy."
3,Hollywood Legends Jean Harlow And Cary Grant In Their Only Teaming On Screen,"MGM's World War I romance ""Suzy"", is unique in being one of Cary Grant's rare forays into working for that studio of studios and his once only teaming with legendary MGM leading lady Jean Harlow. While Jean rather sadly only had a little more than twelve months left to live at the time of production on ""Suzy"", this 1936-37 period saw the real beginnings; (with his later smash hit role in Columbia Studios ""The Awful Truth""),of the ""Cary Grant"", that movie goers would grow to love so much over the next thirty years and beyond. While ""Suzy"", could never be called a movie masterpiece it is a typically polished product of the studio system that MGM in particular developed and nutured so well through the 1930's with its ""more stars than there are in heaven"" motto."
3,LDS,"I am a non-Mormon living in Utah. Its good to know the details of the religion that runs the government in our state. While Mormons often come off as a ""cult"" to mainstram religions, most religions do have their quirks. The LDS may have more than most and this film shares and capitlaizes on some of those. The film won't take an LDS member and make them non-believers, and it won't take a non-LDS and turn them into one. But the information portrayed in the film is accurate if produced in a somewhat amateur presentation. Worthwhile is the Mormon's interest you."
5,A good overview of Mormonism,"This VHS is a good, cursory overview of the Doctrines and beliefs of the ""so called"" Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, more commonly known as Mormons. Although the organization presents itself as a Christian denomination, their belief system clearly puts them way beyond the pale of what is commonly accepted as Christian. Many Mormons would actually be quite surprised at the contents of this tape as they are not all fully aware of the deeper doctrines of their denomination. I hope viewing this will spur you on to further study, as a deep study of this organization is a fascinating undertaking."
3,Don't waste your money,The information was okay but the movie was grainy and poorly made. What a waste of my money! You can get the same info in the book.God Makers (DVD)
1,The God Maker,"I order the VHS tape, ""The God Maker"" from Amazon.com. No where was it stated that the product was in Spanish. Since I speak English, some German and able to read Greek, the Spanish copy was totally useless to me. I contacted Amazon and was given a refund. That speak well for your customer services."
1,Don't waste your money,This dvd is so dated and horribly done. It made the subject matter almost laughable.
4,Listen to FM Radio on your iPod Mini,"Don't be confused about the purpose of this product. The 007-3000 enables you to listed to FM stereo radio using the iPod earbuds. The 007-3000 does not enable your iPod Mini to broadcast through an FM radio for other people to hear.The product performs much like other reviews predicted. The volume through the earbuds is definitely higher than my iPod was set.A factor not predicted is the quality of the sound. I'm not able to explain the difference except to say it's not vivid. Still, I recommend this product to those seeking a listening alternative. Particularly since Apple discontinued the MA070G/A. The Apple MA070G/A, designed solely for iPod Mini, is extremely difficult to find. Incidently, DO NOT confuse the MA070G/A with newer MA070G/B which is for newer iPods than the Mini."
4,This little Cool Gadget - a must for iPod mini,"If you have an old iPod mini, and still love it, then get this one. This little gadget works great with my pink mini, it makes it shine, I'll keep my mini instead of upgrading to nano for another year. :DPerfect match, great sound, very pleased with it."
3,Great idea but greatness has its limits,"There's no way to know if it won't work on specific models. If I bought this first, I would've bought a different I-Pod. I love my tunes but I enjoy catching the radio as well. I wonder if this would work on a fitting I-Pod while docked to a speaker?"
1,Not an S-Video cable.,"The one I received today, even though it has the right parts number, is not a S-Video cable. I received a cable that has a single small RCA type male plug on each end.The only use that I can think of for the cable I received is from a small stero to a single speaker."
3,one major drawback but otherwise a remarkable book.,"A remarkable/inspiring book in so many ways:i rather like Miss Cavalli's tone of voice... the only book i know which deals with the elusive (but vital) role of ballet accompaniment.However,i do hope that future editions correct the truly terrible sin of not attributing any of the music examples to the various composers.The likes of Debussy and even Czerny deserve SO much better than this!Also,a CD accompanying the volume would be a nice extra (as in Charles Rosen's Romantic Generation)."
2,VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE,I AM VERY VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE AS I HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT YET. I WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE A GREAT REVIEW HOPEFULLY IF I HAD ACTUALLY RECEIVED IT AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE THIS PATTERN.
1,Garbage Bulbs,"Three days after using these bulbs and I have blown through four of them. Using latex gloves, not touching the glass, setting up a clean room environment, using three different brand new light fixtures and they still blow out after a few hours use. Took a chance on them after reading some other bad reviews... Dont waste your money like I did!!!"
4,"An Epitaph For the Late, Great Rex Miller","The Complete Revelations is a hodgepodge of different scraps of conversations (and some lost writings) with and about Rex Miller (d. 2004). As such, knowing that we're probably not going to get any new Rex Miller fiction (man, how I'd love to be wrong!), this will have to suffice as a farewell to an extreme talent that never really received the notoriety he deserved. Miller was a fascinating guy with an interesting past, and this somewhat frenetically written book is a good way to say goodbye, assuming you can find it."
4,I liked it!,I liked the story but I felt it was to long and the filler was the couple having sex. This story would have better if it as shorter.Tracey and Jack were a sexy couple but I felt but sex was not their whole story.I as also disappointed that Brickman got away I hope there is a conclusion to this story.
3,Too many unanswered questions,"Too many details left hanging. Since there was no closure to the Brickman case from ""At Last"", I think it took up too much of the story. With Tracy's feelings about her family being such an important part of the story, the confrontation between Tracy and her father should have been shown. They never addressed Mr. Winthrop's reaction to Jack and Tracy. The story was good but could have been great if all issues had been addressed and it would have added even more if Tracy had gotten pregnant, which you expected with all the talk of unprotected sex. It could have added to her dilemma of her fear of loving Jack and his questioning if she got with him for the right reason. So much potential."
3,Caught Up In the Rapture,"The cover of this book is very misleading. I enjoyed Tracy and Jack. I wonted to know what happen to Brickman, Ida the Detective. I did not like the way the story ended."
4,"Enjoyable, But ...","I did enjoy this novel. I thought both Tracy and Jack were likeable characters. The love scenes were good although I prefer my love scenes to be alot steamier. In addition, I was grateful for the fact that Tracy was not obsessed by the racial differences between herself and Jack. Race was dealt with primarily through Tracy's relationship with her mother. This novel did not get 5 stars because of the interweaving subplot of Alex Brickman. This subplot is a carryover from the writer's previous novel ""At Last"" and I am quite fed up with it, since it is more of a distraction rather than an enhancement. It seems only to exist to allow the writer to parlay this theme into future books. There was also one major annoyance and that is the constant reference to Jacques rather than Jack (Jack's mother is French) Querido and Bella."
4,Good read,"i think that the romance between Tracy and Jack was great. Their seemed to be a real connection between them in Paris and they both have similar interests. In fact, both of them are talented linguists.The sex scenes are intense but not nasty, and the introduction of the discussion of race and skin color from Tracy's perspective gives an original spin on the interracial dating theme.It is probably helpful to read ""At Last"" first because some the same protagonists and villains from that book make an appearance in this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and hope to see more entries from Ms. Riley in the future."
2,Didn't even finish the book,"I read some of the other reviews and thought,""It can't be that bad"". Well, it was that bad. This had the potential to be a really good book. It had intrigue, sex, love, family conflict, interracial issues, but I just could not get into it. I didn't really care for any of the characters. The more I read, the less I liked the story, so I stopped reading and skipped to the end. That wasn't satisfying either."
3,Didn't keep me interest like I thought it would.,The beginning of this book started off hot and steamy but it didn't stay that way. I put this book down way too many times and as you can imagine it took me way too long to finish it. The storyline was average and naturely could have been better.
2,Very Disappointing,"Maybe I expect too much and I know I'm old fashioned, but I like romance and characters that are developed. I like a story where characters discover feelings for one another and I as a reader am taken on a journey with them to figure those feelings out. Sandra Kitt knows how to do this. We've all for the most part have been attracted to someone at first sight, but give me a break. There is a difference between romance and erotica. These characters just annoyed me and I didn't care if they got together or not. ""At Last"" was a little better. One reviewer was right, I too found myself more interested in what was going on with Caroline and Brian then Tracy and Jack. The one good thing I can say about ""Caught Up in the Rapture"" is that I love it's book cover."
2,Disappointed,"I rarely write reviews unless I feel strongly about the book. Clearly, I'm one of the only people that found this book disappointing. I was impressed with Ms. Riley's first book and looked forward to this one. In ""At Last,"" my impression of Tracy and Jack was very different. I found her to be superficial and weak and the reason for Jack's obsession with Brickman just didn't feel strong enough to illicit it. Also, I felt that they hi-jacked Caroline and Bryan's story. I found myself reading through the book just to find out more about Caroline and Bryan.I really did want to like these characters, but they kept irritating me. At one point, I vowed to stop reading if Tracy used the French pronunciation for Jack's name one more time. Tomato - Tomateo, I guess."
2,Disappointed,"After a long wait for the promising sequel to ""At Last"", I was disappointed with ""Caught up in the Rapture"". Whilst the main theme focuses very well on the interracial relationship between Jacques and Tracey and aspects of the emotional impact of internalised racism; the linkage between the two books i.e. the subplot I felt lacked bite and cohesion."
3,"Good, but read like a info booklet","read this book though it was okay but it was too much like an information booklet to me on, slavery and black women hair. All the conversations were drawn out and sounded a little unrealistic."
5,Fun!,"I read this sort of fiction for guess what entertainment! This series including this little gem, do it for me. A refreshing look at military sci-fi. Without imperialist (""whitemans burden"") overtones that are part and parcel of the Flashman universe. Which is(historical perspective or not)at times derogatory and to understate it annoying. Happily not an issue in this entertaining series."
5,Very good,"This would be a 4 star and , I rounded to 5 since some of the reviews here where not fair. First, I read so much here about how funny it was, and I felt cheated, and lied to when I read it.O.k. comedy in WarHammer is rare to none existent, so just because there is a few funny parts, peoples freak out, and feel it's the funny thing ever, but really, it's not that funy, I would say its like a Indiana Jones, it's not comedy, but it has it's funny momentsThe story and the way it is written is just great, nice, and a easy read, it's hard to put the book down, but the ending is very obvious, this is where it lost it's star.Still a great buy, and a great book, !!!"
2,Disappointing,"I am a fan of the well written Warhammer novels (such as those by Dan Abnett), and unfortunately, this is not one of them.Sandy Mitchell's characterization of the protagonist Ciaphas Cain is shallow and overwrought, and not at all believable. The writing style itself makes heavy use of ham-fisted foreshadowing (""And if I had known what I know now then blah blah""), interspersed with an absurd number of narrative breaking footnotes from the ""editor."" All in all not well done.The only positive aspect is that it is a fluff read and should not take the average reader too long to work through."
4,An Entertaining Book,"While the Ciaphas Cain books written by Sandy Mitchell lack much of the depth found in the 'Tanith' series by Dan Abnett, it is nonetheless an amusing read. If you do not take the exploits of the main character too seriously, and can read the book from the perspective that it is the memoirs of the main character (and as such prone to exaggeration), then you will enjoy it."
5,An excellent change of pace.,"Mitchell's main character Commissar Cain is one of the most unique, original and thoroghly entertaining in the 40k books I have read so far. This self proclaimed scoundrel's knack for looking out for himself while somehow managing to end up looking like one of the Imperiums mightiest hero's is, while a stretch, quite enjoyable. plenty of action and 40K goodness for all you hard core fans and just a good enjoyable fast paced read for any sci-fi fan."
5,Great humor filled book in the 40K universe,The Ciaphis Cain series is in general a departure from the normal gritty WH40k universe. It features a very unique and likeable character (Cain of course) and has a general great cast of characters. While the build-up of other characters is kind of a weakness (many are forgettable) Sandy does a decent job of it. The first novel really sets the tone for the character and the fact that he always seems to get himself into grave situations at his hardest attempt to avoid them. Highly recommended novel for Imperial Guard WH40k fans or for any WH40k fan that wants a break from all the seriousness.
5,close and intelligent attention to detail - compositional,"ABSOLUTE ZERO: Crashing IconsBased in Miami, this is a very interesting American band, ploughing its own furrow - whose accent is what they call 'prog' over there, but whose language is more complex by far. Pip Pyle adds a seasoned sophistication - in fact I think this is a great environment for him, he shines - but the whole ensemble is way past the foothills and keeping the oxygen packs handy. An excellent first CD, in a style that, features densely composed, layered, slightly post 5UU-school music - with some sung parts, high level rock/abstract improvisation. virtuoso playing and excellent clean, powerful production. In fact close and intelligent attention to detail - compositional, performative and sonic - is its hallmark. These are long-considered, sustained pieces. A fine debut ."
1,Make sure they send the right filter,"We bought three replacement Honeywell filters from Amazon, --3 Honeywell HC888 Humidifier... $9.99 3 $29.97is what the tracking order said. They may have trashed it. They are taller than the original filter that came with our HCM 890 unit, though. they were labeled as fitting the model. It was not easy to squash them down so the starting switch would actuate until they soaked a bit--and they need to be dried out between uses so they don't mildew--that's why we bought three. Last week, I suspect the filter had settled unevenly enough that the fan got caught. At any rate, instead of hearing it start, after a few minutes I smelled the motor burning up."
4,Very Good,"Does its job for a similar humidifier, only I had to cut off about an inch from top to fit my humidifier (not Honey Well). Very Satisfied."
3,Be Gone Allergies Be Gone!,The filters are fine-have used them for years. I ordered 4 from Allergies Be Gone and they sent me a cheap chinese knock off called Best Air. Just go Away Allergies be Gone.
3,Honeywell filter,Its' a filter - what more to say? assume you will need 2 for the season as they dry out if not running non-stop and who can stand the noise of a humidifier going full time 24/7? So after a few months time to change....
2,Not a Great Filter,Had this in my humidifier only a couple of weeks and it started smelling and was growing mold? mildew? Was suppose to NOT allow that to happen. Live and learn.
1,No Good!,"The filters, unlike the others I've had, are just falling apart..little pieces of white everytime they are picked up or moved!I am very disappointed with these filters!"
1,Items not as pictured,"The photos show a Honewell box with filters that have a blue dust catcher on the outside. The items I received were generic, not boxed and had no dust catcher. This is false advertising. Boo!"
2,Not what I ordered,"I received the order promptly, but the filters weren't the Honeywell HC888 that I ordered. The company had substituted another filter, and the diminsions listed are a bit different. I contacted them, and they stated that they were interchangable. I was disappointed that the product delivered was not the product I ordered, and only hope that they work as well as the ones I thought I was going to receive. The only reason I didn't return them is that I would have had to pay shipping, and I am on an extremely tight budget."
3,OK filter,Don't be fooled by the picture there is now blue material wrapping the filter. Just your standard Kaz/Honeywell repacement filter. Adequate but nothing special.
2,Not a good choice for Powdered Drinks,"I generally like Zyliss products but this particular one has a bad lid design. I purchased this to blend protein powder shakes. However, instead of being smooth, the interior of the lid is full of nooks and crannies so what happens is that the powder gets stuck and turns into soggy lumps. So first the powder doesn't get blended into the drink so that's a waste of money and then second, cleaning the shaker is very difficult as you have to dig and dig with a brush or pipe cleaner to get the gunk out of the crevices. While it may work if you're just blending liquids, there are much better shaker choices available for powders. Tupperware makes a good one."
2,Hard to clean the lid,"The mixing part works fine, easy to drink from. But, cleaning out the lid from flakes of the stuff you tried to mix up is impossible. You have to use a brush to get into the tight places, they should have molded it more solidly."
2,It leaks when you shake it...No good,"The bottle design is good but on the second day i used it, it started leaking from the top when i shook myprotein shake in it. I made sure it was tight but still leaks slightly.It's not bad enough to throw it away but not happy with the seal quality."
1,Bad design,"First of all it really doesn't mix things up that well, but the worst part is that when you flip up the lid there is a tiny hole to drink out of, so unless you are used to drinking from a baby bottle or have a straw handy, it is frustratingly slow to drink out of; there is no room for air to get in while you are sipping.I would recommend the Blender BottleSundesa BB28-MC01 BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Blueinstead."
1,terrible design,"The weight distribution is high, add to this a small footprint and your (badly mixed, more later..) drink will fall over if you sneeze at it. The lid is full of nooks & crannies, some cavernous structures are impossible to clean without a water-jet tool, and they all fill up with DRY ingredients that never make it into your shake! I put half a teaspoon full of Spirulina on top of some Whey Protein, and found that almost ALL of the Spirulina was caked into the lid with a layer of Whey Protein sealing it away. My shake wasn't green in the slightest. When I went to clean it, I found even more powder caked around the rim, hiding under that poorly designed mixing blade! I spent another 5-10 minutes squirting water into the deep crevices so I don't get a mold problem after the first use... Don't buy this if you're thinking about making protein shakes."
1,"Epic fail, sending this back","I bought this bottle because my sister-in-law has a similar one and loves it. They must have made some changes for this design, because this bottle is terrible and I will be returning it. I filled it with milk and popped it in my lunch bag this morning. It leaked all over my lunch bag! Once I added my protein shake powder, the mess grew. I had powder stuck in the drink spout and in every nook and cranny of the lid. Couldn't get it out, no matter how hard I shook. Very disappointed."
5,Cool item,"I bought this so that my husband and I can have different flavors of shakes. Worked well with our older Cuisinart. I have a Vitamix now...so it won't work or course, but I still use it just to drink the shake from it."
3,Great until it's not...,"I purchased 2 of these shakers and agree that they fit my blender perfectly. They are easy to use with the measurements on the bottle and the screen makes shaking in protein powder acceptable (the lid ALWAYS has a lot of half mixed powder that has to be soaked out). I've used mine (switching off between the two) daily for about 3 months. Unfortunately, over time the lid has begun to leak and not just one but both. They are inexpensive and easily replaced, but the lid is definitely the design weakness of this product. Between the difficulty in cleaning and the tendency to stretch over time, it weakens this products score."
2,"Well, at least I can still shake it...","I bought this specifically because I wanted to be able to connect it to the blender. I tried to pair it with 3 different blenders - and none of them fit. Two of what I tried were Cuisinart brand, one was a Kitchenaid. I actually tried it with another off-brand as well, with no luck.A list of compatible blenders would be helpful before you actually purchase one.Sturdy plastic; too tall for my dishwasher's top shelf; sometimes difficult to keep the lid opened to drink from it.Wouldn't purchase this one again. I'll stick with my old tried and true Tupperware shakers."
5,Live is the way to hear Selena in her full electric glory.,"A live album usually sounds distorted and weak compared to a musician's identical studio recordings. Not in this case. Selena was not just a singer. She was a Performer. You know that when you hear the audience screaming her name and the announcer introducing the one and only Selena. Turn up the volume, boost the bass just a touch and prepare to join a live performance right in your living room. Selena is awesome on stage, where she comes alive and works the crowd into a frenzy. If you like her music or want to feel what it would have been like to be at one of her concerts, buy this album. You will not be disappointed. And don't be surprised if one day you take it along in your car and drive to work or play jamming to ""La Carcacha""."
4,THIS DVD IS A MUST ...,"I have bought and seen this DVD several times. Finally there is a JENNA JAMESON DVD behind the scene look!!! The only thing that bothered me is that the picture quality is average (disappointing because this is a dvd not a vhs), besides that its finally nice to see Jenna talk her mind once in a while without haveing her legs up in the air in a V-shape! Anyways this is a great first behind look, hopefully there will be a follow up! THANKS"
5,HARD TO FIND,"I'm a lic. locksmith & use key caps all the time but after several suppliers went out of business, they are hard to find at a good price. What I paid here on Amazon is a very good price & they shipped very fast. Also they are good quality & are exactly as pictured."
4,He has Nothing But Kung Fu (Well - that's all he needed),"Loved it! Gordon Liu -what can I say - he has the moves! A few funny scenes. The plot was there all the way until the end! I can't say that about all Kung Fu flicks - some have none! This is a classic that's earned to be in my top 5% and one I can watch a few times over. Not only were the fighting scenes pretty good - it was well chorographed. Hey, I can see the talent in this movie!"
4,Gordon Lui's Kung Fu in this movie is great,This is my second Gordon Liu Movie to see and I was a little disapoited in him when I saw Shaolin Drunken Monk but in this move he is great. My only complaint about this movie is nobody is as dumb as the charcters in this move. There are many things that are so obvious that they don't figure out. If you can get past that the rest of the story and the Kung fu are great.
2,Fun,"This film is pretty fun, but not very good. I think it's one of those: So Bad It's Good. I would suggest a better script to the makers of this film."
4,An all-time Classic,"A young fighter left with memory loss after an accident he can't remember is teamed up with a local beggar and pic pocket. Unaware of where he is or how he got there the young fighter played by Gordon Liu relies on The trickster Wang Yue to help him around, and also keep him out of harms way. Instead the two men seem to find more trouble then they can get away from, and Liu's Past creeps its way back onto the scene. Can he find out who he is before something really bad happens? Or was his biggest mistake in who he chose to be his company? A great film with real good comedy, and astonishing fights. Gordon Liu and Wang Yue are brilliant, and this film is not to be missed by any martial arts film fan."
5,Curl up on the couch with this too-cute book.,"Make this your winter of content by curling up on the couch with the It Girl's Guide to Video, and then pressing the power button on your VCR. Meredith Alexander has done us all a huge favour by ""screening"" the movies that define glam. No more need to hesitate over what to rent at the video store. The must-see films are all there in this must-have book. The It Girl's Guide to Video is not only a great resource, it's a great read."
5,Must have educational tool in style and substance.,"This book takes us back to a world where style existed. An educational tool in film, fashion and fun. Meredith Alexander has sifted through everyones video store to bring us highlights of your favorite movies you haven't watched yet."
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL IT GIRLS (AND EVEN THOSE WHO ASPIRE),"BUT SERIOUSLY, HOW DID WE MANAGE AT THE VIDEO STORE WITHOUT THIS REFERENCE GUIDE? THIS BOOK IS VERY WELL DONE AND THE AUTHOR HAS AN ASTOUNDING KNOWLEDGE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF OUR TIME. IT MAKES THE PURRRRFECT COFFEE TABLE BOOK, THE COVER IS HOT PINK SO WE KNOW THAT IT WILL ""WORK"" IN ANY IT GIRL'S LIVING ROOM!"
2,The Poe Shadow,"I did not enjoy thiis book, I found it confusing at times. Several in my book club agreed. Only 1 person enjoyed the book"
1,Not the same as item purchased in salon,"This item is different from the Loreal Vitamino Color Shampoo I purchased previously from my hair salon. This item is gray and has a thinner consistency. The one from the salon is white and fluffy and you only have to use a little at a time. I tried to save money, but this does not seem like the same product. I won't make that mistake again."
5,L'oreal Serie Expert Vitamino Color Shampoo,"I absolutely LOOOOOOOOVE this shampoo! It is very gentle on my thinning hair. I also love that it does not strip the Natural (vegitable based/herbal) hair color I use. In addition it smells great! All around a great shampoo. I recommend the conditioner that is the same brand but comes in a ""Yellow"" container instead of the Pink like this shampoo. Sorry not in my shower right now and cannot remember the exact type. It's for hair that is damaged. Hope this helps."
1,what do I do?,I orderd the conditioner not shampoo. What do I do if I already recieved the product and used it. I know i orderd the conditioner and got the wrong thing
3,Not nearly as good as the original Howliday Inn,"Well, when I first started reading this, I was so intrigued. The uncovering of the bones and collar was SO dang spooky!! But then it all just fizzled out. I was really disappointed. And I missed the old cast of characters from Howliday Inn: Louise, Taxi, Max . . . especially Lyle, the secret agent cat! I swear, this book is nowheres near as good as Howliday Inn! The original is much spookier and cooler 'cause there's lots and lots of real dangers! If you haven't read the original Howliday Inn, I so recommend you do so!"
1,Never arrived,"I was so disappointed when I was notified the calendar was unavailable. I have a Beagle, and this is the first year I've been without this fun calendar!"
1,Don't waste your time,The cards are hard to read. The voice will drive you crazy. The same voice is on every game. The voice is hard to understand.There must be a simple texas hold em game out there to download and keep it simple. The one that comes with Vista XP is great. It is not on my lap top.
2,Hackneyed!,"This is the kind of movie in which the protagonist was beaten so badly that you would believe he would not be living long. Then, somehow, someway, he revived himself and next minute you saw him kicking asses!Like most of Shaw Brothers' 1000 plus movies, this production was also staged in the company's various studios. The tired storyline and the lack of any jaw-dropping ku-fu actions really couldn't ease the claustrophobic feel that a lot of Shaw Brothers' movies frequently impact on the audience consciously and unconsciously."
2,Undelightful Fight Scenes!!,"Story line and acting was decent, fight scenes were not! I watch these types of films mostly for the fight scenes, in this flick they are slow and fake looking almost to the point of being funny. I think the fight choreographer must have fallen asleep too....."
2,Problem witht he blu ray...,"I have yet to finish the movie it self, but with in the first min I already had a extreme ghost tear in the movie, then a 4 second freeze on the same part of the disc, I don't knwo why this is... but not too happy and scared of my future well go blu ray films."
2,I was expecting better....Ick,"These are not fresh strawberries. They are OK, but not worth the $28 you pay. They have a chewy, gummy-worm consistency. I ate two of them and threw the box away. The chocolate was good, and the seller is great."
1,Looks NOTHING like the picture,"Thought it would be better...the chocolate wasn't very good, the strawberries were tiny."
4,Must-have for the Die-Hard Skins fan,"This is a great little set. The original broadcasts of all 3 Redskins superbowl victories. You get the FULL TV broadcast, minus the garbage halftime entertainment. As other's have said though, that's it. There is no additional commentary or analysis, and the quality is what it is. This is especially noticeable in the '83 superbowl broadcast. But for the price, I ain't complaining. It's really cool to watch these, especially for you young bucks who are way too young to remember a time when the Redskins were actually good (and often dominant), and well-respected. And you can't beat a game called by Madden and Summerall."
3,"Super Bowls are nice, but...","Winning the Super Bowl is great, and watching these games is awesome. However, any true Redskins fan will tell you that the two greatest games in 'Skins history are the NFC Championship wins over Dallas. In fact, you could make an entire set out of wins over Dallas alone. The Ken Houston game, the last RFK game, even the Monday nighter in week 2 of 1991.By the way, Why is it that some teams get Greatest Games collections of up to 10 games, and the Redskins only get 3? It's time for an updated set."
3,Missing some games,"The Redskins, like the Raiders, Steelers and 49ers had many other great games outside of there super bowls. How about the 1972, 1982, and 1983 NFC Championships? 1990 wildcard win vs Eagles? 1986 and 1987 divisional playoff wins vs Bears?"
4,Correction on playoff games,"Actually there were three playoff games the redskins played before facing Miami in the Super Bowl because of the players strike in 1982. They beat Detroit 31-7,Minnesota 21-7 and Dallas 31-17 in the NFC Title Game, and then followed by beating Miami 27-17 in the Super Bowl. Hopefully,this set will contain all of these games..."
2,Not what I expected,"I have a Godinger Oblong Baroque Jewelry Box that my mother gave to me 12 years ago and I bought this expecting the same quality. Well, it's pretty and roomy, but light as a feather...VERY dissappointing. My Oblong box (half the size of this one!) weighs 2.8 pounds and this one weighs 2.4 pounds! I was going to buy more of the oblong boxes for my daughters (I have 4 and they all want the box Grandma gave me), but now I'm afraid that it will be just as cheaply made. Do not buy if you want something nice and of quality that you can pass on to your kids. Buy only if you want a cheapy."
1,Al plays the medieval fool,"If you want to see a video with any kind of depth, do NOT buy Medieval Soldier starring ""Al"" (Richard Karn) from ""Tool Time."" OK, there are some funny moments but Karn's antics get old in a hurry. This video has some good information but does not really give an accurate view of what a Medieval Soldiers life was actually like. Also, the historians interviewed for this video know history but, like most historians, don't know squat about medieval weapons or how they were used. So be warned: this is more about Richard Karn reading cue cards and acting like a fool than learning about medieval soldiers."
4,LICHENS,"This is an excellent introduction to the biology of the lichens. It is very well written, covers the topic quite well, and is profusely illustrated with first rate color photographs. it is not an identification manual, butt a great explanation as to what lichens are.."
3,hopefully better than CLC drywall pouch,"It seems like they are making these pouches cheaper and cheaper. The first one I owned I got about 7 years out of. Which is great considering the price. Eventually the hammer loop broke. I purchased the same pouch, both CLC, and the hammer loop broke again after only 6 months. I've been using the same set-up for 12 years and I'm not about to change. The Heritage pouch is the same design as the CLC. Maybe this one will last longer than six months. I'll let you know."
3,Better,They sounded better than my stock speakers but after a few weeks I am dissapointed with the clarity when riding at higher volume levels.
5,"Second Serve, ahead of its time...","I first read this book in the early 1980's. It is a book that was ahead of it's time on the subject of gender identification. The book is an autobiography and the author conveys her story in an intensely personal, yet well written manner. I remember being unable to put it down. I am not gender dysphoric, however the struggles and triumphs of the author are easily shared by anyone who is, or has ever been close to someone who is ""different."" I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a good story or the issues mentioned."
1,Second Serve reviewed,Dr.Renee Richards was much in the news during the late seventies when she sought to be allowed to take part in women's tennis matches. She was successful in her battles to do this. This book was later made into a tv movie starring Vanessa Redgrave. This book is clearly not about a true transsexual person. Dr. Richards is a transvestite who had many homosexual encounters. She someone thinks that having gay sex while in women's clothing somehow made her totally heterosexual. The book states 'heterosexual as a man and as a woman'. The book goes into graphic examples of her pre and post surgical sex life. Totally unnecessary. She claims that the surgery made her life 'unbelievibly satisfying'. Now she tells People magazine that the sex reassignment was a mistake and urges trans people to seek psychiatric help such as prozac or institutionalization.
3,Ok but not as good as I hoped,"The floor mats are easy to install and cover a good portion of the floor but I am disappointed by how much of the carpet is still showing. The sides are completely uncovered and living in the north, that's a huge problem. By the time winter was over, the sides of my tan carpet were a muddy mess. These would have been worth the money if they had a flap that also covered the side of the carpet. Kind of pointless to have covers when the first part a dirty foot steps on is totally uncovered. I wouldn't buy these again."
5,A wedding must have!!!,"From one stressed out bride to another, do yourself a favor and pick up this book. I spent a lot of time searching various resources for the prefect ceremony before I was given this book. The format and abundance of choices makes this book useful to a wide variety of engaged couples. There are several ceremonies outlined in the book. If one section doesn't suit you, there are pages of choices to pick from. You can mix and match the different sections until you have a ceremony perfect for you, or go with one of the full ceremonies detailed in the book. There are even option for second weddings, bilingual and civil ceremonies. I was able to set up a traditional, elegant ceremony, word for word in less than 30 minutes. I heartily recommend this book to any would be newlyweds."
4,2ND BEST,THIS IS THE 2ND BEST OF ALL WEDDING BOOKS FOR A MINISTER. THE 1ST IS THE BAKER'S WEDDING HANDBOOK. I PURCHASED 15 BOOKS AND WAS WORRIED BUT THESE 2 BOOKS ARE THE ONLY ONES I USE FOR MY WEDDINGS. THEY MADE IT EASY AND LESS STRESS. THANK YOU!
5,Worth every penny.,"As a woman who is also a business professional, my time is very valuable. I was looking for a book that would provide me with words, vows, readings, and ideas that were both familiar and yet fresh. That's exactly what this book provided. Other books I purchased were too involved and time intensive. As ""Goldilocks"" would say, not too much; not too little; just right. This book was worth every penny. If this book were ""time"", I got a bargain. The SIMPLICITY of this book took the STRESS our of my ceremony planning. I'm recommending this book to several of my friends who are also getting married."
4,Helpful but limited,"I bought this book to help write the wedding ceremony for our officiant (friend). It is helpful in the aspect that it lays out a variety of ceremonies from start to finish, but the selections are somewhat limited if you aren't looking for the basic cookie cutter ceremony. If you are looking for more options for readings and vows, I recommended you check out the book by Judith Johnson. If you just need a couple of ideas for a ceremony - this book will be helpful for you"
2,Not for non-religious ceremonies,"I was disappointed in this book. It was very thin for one thing...not a lot of choices. Also, if you are planning a non-religious ceremony, you will not find much to use. I was not impressed."
2,Okay but 'S' way too big for t-shirt,It's all in the title. The movie sucked but I licked the design of the 'S' and the way it stood out. It doesn't work on this t-shirt though.
5,Steam Album,5 stars all around. If you are a true classic rocker then this album is a must. I have been looking for Steam for a while. Thanks again for the timely service. Dave R.
3,"Good, mostly for hit song","I really don't listen to this that much outside of Na Na Hey Hey. It's decent music, though."
4,can I say WOW,"The sound is almost as though you are not wearing it, high fidelity and clear. When you shoot it silences it great! BUT they are huge, it barely fits in my normal/large ears. I wish it fit better they would be my go to ear protection for construction and farm work I do. But I will keep them in my shooting bag because an hour of wear is about all i can handle, because they hurt my ears."
5,Great price!,"Great product with good package, it was not the big box in the screen shots, they sent me two separate boxes but it the same thing, just a different presentation."
2,Early expiration,"The price for the 100 pcs Accu Check test strips is very reasonable. However, the manufacturer should disclose the expiration date of the product they publish to sell because I bought 2 cartons (200 strips) 3 weeks ago and they expires this Dec. 2012. I would not have bought them had I known the expiration date is very short."
4,Accu-Chek Diabetes Test Strip,"Insurance Co. won'tcover this item any more, so we decided to buy on the internet. Got a great price,fast shipping,and very satisfied with purchase."
4,Katy's Review,Charlie's Monument was a really good books that teaches life skills on learning to love others who have disabilities. And also to remember the good things and to keep on going no matter what happens to you.
1,wrong item sent,"Unfortunately the wrong item was sent.The t-shirt that was sent bore only a vague resemblence tothe t-shirt I ordered.Also, I returned this item a month and a half ago and have notreceived credit on my VISA card yet for the return.My other purchases thru Amazon have been great, but this onedid not turn out very well."
5,as described and fast shipped but...bizarre shipping,"The item was perfect condition, new, and now with the part my coffee machine is as if it was just gotten. The only thing I have an issue with is that the seller simply put the braun holding box with item in it that normally would be on a shelf and shipped it as that with not putting the shelf boxed item in an actual shipping box with packing material. The box was a bit battered from the mailing luckily the item came through the experience ok. While the item was as described etc. It makes me leary of ordering something else from this seller. It was somewhat like taking a bottle of aspirin that comes in it's own advertising box on a shelf, slapping a sticker on it and throwing it in the post office over the counter to ship. Bizarre. The item itself excellent and brand new but again....the shipping, I just couldn't fathom how somebody running a business would do that."
1,On my fourth vise,"I wish I was able to review this product. However every one I have received was damaged. This 84lb vise arrived in single layer cardboard box. The traversing rods were sticking out of the box and were damaged, preventing you from screwing the nut on. Yes, on all four vises, one of them had cement embedded in the rod and the allen key bolts in the side of the vise. Hardware was missing in two of the boxes. The packaging is totally inadequate for this heavy of a package. I have read that the 3 inch precision cross slide is packaged much better, I will be returning this 8 inch for the fourth time and I will give that one a shot. If I could buy this at a store it might be okay, but apparently shipping is not working."
1,Good grief,"If you want baby to benefit from early exposure to music, try another DVD. I recommend Piano by Dot (ages 4 and up) or Trebellina (birth up), the latter of which teaches babies how to read music (as well as playing mozart, groove, etc)."
1,This card doesn't really work on Macintosh as advertised.,"Let me save you people some trouble. 1). This card does work on pc's. 2) Apple Computer has pulled it from the Apple Store 3) It does NOT work on G4 towers with theexception of the ""MIRROR-DOOR Models ONLY! "" 4) ATI tech support acknowledged to me that they where only able to get the card to run on a MIRROR-DOOR MODEL G4 and nothing else, yet it continues to be marketed for ""AGP G4 Towers"". There are no AGP cards currently manufactured for the G4 Tower. THe only card which works at this time is the Radeon 9200 (PCI). If you need an AGP card you MUST go to éBy for it. Please Believe me on this...I learned the hard way and want to save you the hassles that I went through. :-)"
4,Works beautifully...,"I am using this with my 30"" Dell monitor on a PC at 2560x1600. I've never been happier."
4,Tarzan Finds a Son,I wanted to make sure when I purchased this product that the picture and listening quality were good and it was exactly what I wanted. It was like watching the original movie on TV when I was a young child.
1,Sent wrong item,"According to the description this is a pair of pants, but instead I received a pair of shorts."
5,Fantastic Product!,"This product is the best purchase I've made in a very long time! I start steaming right after work and then go for my walk. When I get home my juice is done and I can start making jelly right away! I've told everyone I know how wonderful this is. A ""MUST HAVE"" for jelly makers. Wish I had this years ago.SandyUpper Michigan"
4,DRAIN TUBE PROBLEMS,My brother purchased this product. The drain tube was rotten and broke off while he was making juice. He was lucky he did not get burned. It was rotten on the whole tube. Then the clamp does not shut off completely. Otherwise he is very happy with his steamer. Please check your other steamers tubes so no one will get injured.
4,One of the best investments I've made!,"This is the only way to make grape jelly! I've always used the boil and squish method. The boiling part is a cinch, but the squishing part is a pain and makes a really big mess. This unit isn't built to withstand a lot of physical abuse, it can dent and bend easily (which is why I gave it only four stars) but it does the job and is a decent price. If you are looking for a simple juicer, this is it. Just be sure to take good care of it and store it where it won't get banged around."
1,Nice juicer but the bottom is very cheep,We bought this juicer last year and found it works very well except for one thing. The bottom pan is very thin and won't take much heat before it will develop a pin hole leak. I patched the first leak but it just keeps developing leaks. The metal is too thin.
5,"Tickled by ""Words""","Quintessential Suid: intelligent, thoughtful, finely crafted, infused with a delicately-dry, cultured wit, and marinated in a child-like, exuberant curiosity.Then, dusted lightly with an unspoken intent to inform, entertain, and empower.'Tis a modest book written to quietly awaken, illuminate, and freshen the way we all see, hear, and use our living, fluid language. Simply ""relightful"".Stan Friedman - art photographerSanta Monica, CA"
3,Chicken fingers,"3 1/2Just the fact that this blues-rock still bristles with vibrancy over forty years after it was recorded says a lot. Embellishing just enough of oh-so-familiar structure to keep things consistently heartfelt and mostly engaging, it's one of only a handful in the endlessly repetitious genre worthwhile to me."
2,Astronomy review,"Although it covers the topic well, unlike other entries in the Quick Review series, it does NOT have start of chapter goals ('Chapter Check-In'), end of chapter questions ('Chapter Checkout'), end of book review test ('CQR Review'), a glossary, and worst of all considering the length of the book, an index."
1,poor quality,this ia poor design of a necklace. Very cheaply made. when I recived the neckalace there were two knots about 2 inches apart from each other which caused the beads to have 2 sepeart gaps where beads couldn't go. it broke on day 1 this was just a horrible cheap design i'm better off making one myself. NOT WORTH THE PRICE FOR NECKLACE OR SHIPPING
5,The First Book you should read if considering Self-Publishing,"This is by far the best book to get your feet wet with. This book gives you all the basic in's and out's without any sort of fluff and ""rah rah"" pep talk like all the other books do. Yes, many other books have great information to provide, but half the time they are so busy trying to sell you all their other books and products that they gloss over the finer points that are needed. Thank you H.L. for giving it to us straight. No BS, no ""you can be a world famous multi-million dollar author in no time"" kind of crap. If you are seriously contemplating going into the self-publishing world, read this book first. It will give you a general idea of which path is right for you and help you make more informed decisions as you venture through this realm of smoke and mirrors."
5,Wow...this brings back memories,"Jose Luis Perales is the ""James Taylor"" of Spain. I remember growing up as a child in Spain and listening to his songs on the radio and tape on the many car rides and vacations that I took with my parents. These songs...and his voice bring back so many memories of my childhood in Spain. Its a great ""nostalgic"" trip back in time. His songs, as I listen to them as a adult, I find them to be romantic and touching. He is a great songwriter, and he has this ""haunting"", ""romantic"" voice. One great CD!"
4,Great Machine,"I purchased my I mac g5 back in October. It has been working way better than my HP. I have upgraded mine to a GB of ram. It is really fast. No problams. My only complaint is how loud it is. I don't know if that goes for just me or everyone. But overall this is a great computer. The all in one feature is nice, because i don't have to have all of the extra cords. I am switching over to mac now. Way better then windows. I never have to worry about viruses or firewalls."
2,MacOS X is the greatest OS but this is the worst machine by Apple.,"Stay away from this thing! Runs WAY too hot, lots of early failures, the screen is so hot it burns your eyes like staring into a camp fire. Form over function taken much too far in this machine! This form in a Pentium M would probably be the best machine they've ever sold."
5,Best of the Best with a surprise.,"If you are a Chieftains and/or Jean Butler fan this is the something you will want to add to your collection. Not only do you get a great performance by the Chieftains, but you get to see a young Jean Butler in triditional dancing clothes before she became the star of Riverdance. The only down side is that you have to put up with Rodger Daltry for a few songs. His rock and roll style just didn't blend well with the Chieftains. The surprise was two lovely songs from Nancy Griffin. All in all this is not a bad show if you can ignore Daltry. His time on stage would have been better put to use if it went to Jean or Nanci."
2,not satisfied,"not very clear picture or audio, i would not recommend it to any one els to purchase, would not but again"
4,Not Their Best,"I enjoyed the DVD but could have done without Roger Daltry's contribution. I like the Chieftains, but sometimes I feel they try to over stretch themselves. Traditional is what they do best."
2,buy,"i've been trying to purchase goods from ur site but i don't rely understand the procedure to follow.Pls, kindly enlight me better"
3,Imation 512 Pocket Flash Drive,"I think flash drives are fantiastic, but this one was a bit of a hassle setting up the security and deciding how much of the drive to dedicate to the secured portion. (Shouldn't the entire drive be secured??) The instructions were not exceptionally clear, either. It was worth the price for the 1/2 gig, but, could be more user friendly."
5,Great Book,"This book has become my bible of designing. I am a home business gift basket owner , and thanks to this book I can now design beautiful designs."
2,Basic,"This book contains good info, but only on a VERY BASIC level. It's almost too basic. Not much new or innovative. If you've never made a basket or wrapped a package, then this is your book."
4,Informative and Helpful...,"While this book is informative and helpful, I find that much of the informtion is a bit redundant. I have one additional book from this author and although the format is a bit different, it does repeat itself from time to time. There are so many books available for those who wish to start a gift basket business, learn to construct a beautiful and well-balanced basket and for those who are really daring and wish to customize the basket or container with paints/embellishments before filling it. I must give kudos to Amazon for offering a good selection of the above. I did a local search first and it was a waste of gas and time. Most of our local bookstores carry one book (if any) in this genre."
3,nice but little information,"If you're looking strictly for pictures of beautiful baskets then this is the book to get. If you want to learn the ""ins & outs"" of gift basket making then get her other book: ""How to start a home-based gift basket business"" It's very informative & instructional."
5,the marbles,a very young grahame bonnet singing ''ONLY ONE WOMEN' PLUS ALL THE OTHERS ON THIS REMARKABLE CD OF THEIR GREATEST TRACKS '' a must for any grahame bonnet fans..the vocals are outstanding.
3,Tracklist,"The tracklisting for the Totally Diva DVD is:1. Why, 2. Legend in My Living Room, 3. Precious, 4. Money Can't Buy It, 5. Cold, 6. Primitive, 7. The Gift, 8. Walking on Broken Glass, 9. Keep Young and BeautifulUnfortunately the video that was made for Little Bird is not included on this release, actually it has not been on any release at all."
4,left disappointed,"I have been a huge fan of the Eurythmics and Annie Lennox since the beginning of their career, long before the rest of the world discovered their greatness, so anything less than compliments from my lips (or fingrtips) is quite painful for me. I was thrilled to have a collection of her amazing videos, but I cannot get over the fact that ""Walking On Broken Glass"" and ""Little Bird "" were so obviously missing. I actually felt slightly angry that they were not included. I love all of Annie Lennox's creations, especially the ""B-sides"", so I was not just looking for the big hits, but this is close to an unforgivable void. I felt a bit cheated. (Please forgive me for saying this, Ms. Lennox, I still admire you)."
5,buy it.,"annie's best solo album is DIVA. the video is amazingly what i was imagining when I heard DIVA. if you appreciate the ""unique and creative"" approach to life, then you will want this. IF YOU DON'T: DO NOT BUY THIS, IT'S TOO ""DEEP"" FOR YOU(?)"
3,Marks off for Imcomplete,"These videos look like they were shot on the cheap after the production company blew their budget on the videos for ""Little Bird"" and ""Walking on Broken Glass"" - both of which are conspicuously absent from this collection. Lennox and co. do their best with bare-bones minimal sets, costuming and camera angles, but it's just not enough to sustain interest for the full length of the tape. Lennox fans wanting to complete their collections shouldn't be put off, but those looking only for the hits from Diva should look elsewhere."
4,The only diva!,"Annie Lennox's Diva album was truly one of the classic albums of the 90's. The Grammy Award-winning video companion was a perfect audio-visual creation that was emotive and stylish. This expanded version includes Walking On Broken Glass and a bonus track Remember. The latter, an instrumental track, is placed in the collection but not listed anyway until you play the disc. In so doing, the sequence of songs got messed up after Cold. Dropouts were rather frequent but otherwise this is a disc to have. Thankfully, the original had great sound and even though the promise of 5.1 surround sound was ultimaely not delivered in this shoddy DVD, it still sounds great. 5**** for the excellent music but 0* for the package and encoding."
3,Annie Lennox Totally Diva Downer,"Annie is great, but her DVD version of ""Totally Diva"" is very disappointing. No booklet or photos. I was expecting something a bit more including several tracks from her CD that are not on the DVD. Perhaps, a revamping of the product would give it the DIVA standard it deserves. I still love you Annie."
5,"Please, tell me....","what does include this DVD ? Is it Diva album or Live in Central Park ? Please, send me a mail to acharlyz@hotmail.com Thanks Oscar"
4,Loctite 641,"FSA bicycle company suggests using this Loctite 641 on the bottom bracket spindle (axle) and the splined area inside the left crank arm. Purpose is to keep the bottom bracket secure.Applied this to my crankarm a few hundred miles ago, and it is working.The only disadvantage to the Loctite 641 is the cost. It is an expensive item.Much like other Loctite compounds, I will say this, the product DOES DO what the intention is."
5,"So good, they can't make a movie of it","This book has to be read more than once to catch all the nuances....great stories, interesting perspective on ""regular"" folks of the period (hot socialist divorcee authors? Bisexuality? Cloak and Dagger? Jews -vs-Poles in Detroit)...just great writing. I've found this to be the only one of her books I could read, but it's wonderful."
3,"Entertaining and enjoyable, but light.","If you are looking for a soap opera, you will like this book. The storyline is interesting, but the background of WWII is an interesting canvas. The book is very long (nearly 800 pages) and much of it is fluff. It can become tedious. Fortunately, it is divided into chapters by character, so if you don't connect with one you can skim their chapters and focus on others."
1,I hated this book.,I am surprised people reread this book. The more I read the less I liked this book. I found I did not like any of the characters either. There are better ways to spend your reading time.
1,Filled with errors,"A historical novel should at least have some connection with accuracy. This has so many things wrong I gave up counting. If you want to learn about World War II, read real history by a real historian, or at least by a good novelist like Herman Wouk who was actually there."
2,"Good read, Bad history","Here we go again. Well written, so so research, modern PC sensibilities. Cable TV quality in print. Assumes much with little to back it up. Perfect for the history lite, present politically correct crowd. Enough said."
2,If you loved Gone With the Wind,"I rarely read sagas, but since several friends recommended this, I gave it a try. Now I remember why I'm usually careful about which ones I read. It doesn't help when many of the characters are just plain not likeable. Oscar and Abra? Eeeeuwww!!!! Daniel and Gloria? Eeeeuwww!!!! Zach and Bernice? Gross!!!! I guess if you think World War II was about desperate people having sex this book is for you. Plus the coincidence of characters crossing was beyond belief. In the context of this being a ""serious historical novel"" I find that inexcusable.Some of the historical parts were interesting - Murray (with his nine lives) in the Pacific, Danielle's activities with the French Resistance, the bombings of London.Years ago I read Herman Wouk's ""War and Remembrance"" and I remembered that it kept me spellbound. A great, popular WWII saga. For insight into the American experience both and home and abroad try Studs Terkel's ""The Good War: An Oral History of World War II"""
2,Okay plot--certainly not well-written,"I really had a hard time getting through this book and forced myself to complete it because it was my book club's selection. I could have put it down for good at any point and not have given it a second thought.For me, the contrived plot, with its inaccurate history, was not enough. I enjoy a well-written book which this was not. It was totally bloated-- almost 800 pages. Although periodically Piercy included a metaphor that would sing, I had to wade through sentences full of unnecessary anecdotal phrases that added nothing to the plot or character development. It could easily have been trimmed to 450-500 pages and still had the same impact.There is nothing subtle or literary about this book, including the poor grammar. As I read, in my mind I had my editor's pen at the ready deleting superfluous text constantly. Is there some rule that no noun can stand alone? Must they all have at least one adjective?"
2,Blech,"I hated this book, it was much more boring than it could've been, plus the book tries to focus on both men and women but Piercy tries to make the women come off as having the harder time, and make the men fighting in the war look like panzies! I know Piercy is a feminist but come on. Plus 2 of the 4 men die off completey. Overall i'd say that this story was a flop and was very unentertaining. What a waste of a good 16 hours."
5,Great followup to Women Who Run With THe Wolves,"I had read Dr. Estes' book, Women Who Run With THe Wolves, several years ago. Listening brought back the disturbing and life-changing images and stories of the book. The 6 cassettes cover issues of intuition, body image, women's and mens experiences of sacred power, and much, much more. What I especially enjoyed was hearing Dr. Estes' voice and especially her laughter, which her books couldnt quite commuticate. I laughed, listened, cried, sighed from relief at truths spoken and wrestled with stories that poked at hidden places in my spirit. I highly recommend this,not as entertainment, but as soulfood."
5,A must have!,"This set is a must have! The warmth, humor and wisdom contained in these tapes will last you a lifetime. Dr. Estes is an unbelievable author and storyteller in print, but if you've never heard her voice - prepare to be mesmerized!!"
4,Okay GPS unit,"I wouldn't say this is the fastest GPS system in the world, but for the price (130$ from Dell), this unit does its job competently. Auto rerouting is kind of slow, but i think this will not be a huge issue since its directions are fairly easy to follow and rerouting does not occur very often. Software design is primitive. UI is of a Win 95 style. Despite its unattractive appearance (for both soft- and hardware), the unit have good signal reception and locks on to it pretty fast. It will have no problem taking you from point A to B."
1,"Hopeful, but let down by poor quality","Had a very difficult timer getting this unit to work. 9 out of 10 times it would lock up just trying to power it on and calibrate the touch screen. Once calibrated, it would lock up every 3-5 days of use requiring a power off and then try cycling it several times till it woudl finally calibrate and be used. unacceptable to have it crap out and require that I stop the car and fiddle with it to get it operating again so i could complete my journey. prolly just a defective unit, but the POI data was horrid as well so back it went. Even at $130 from Dell, not worth the hassle. Got authorization from Dell to return it even though they say all returns must occur within 21 days."
2,It freezes and the map has issues,This gps freeze a lot. The softwares has bug. Its has a low CPU 266 mhz which mean it take more time to do things which other gps with a cpu 400+ mhz does instantly. This GPS you will have to do a lot of resetting as a normal use.
3,A little out dated,"Item recieved has software and maps from 2005, and is a little slow. It also doesn't pick the fastest routes like advertised due to, in my opinion old software."
4,one drawback..he went too easy on them,"It was a delightfull read first of all. The likes of ""The Pet Psychic"" and ""John Edwards"" called to task. I loved it. However, my one complaint about this otherwise great book, was that the author had them down and squirming via obvious facts..but eased off. If this book ever goes into a 2nd edition, I hope the author will finish what he has started and ""throttle 'em good.""refreshing, open and logical look at all the sillyness people still believe in. A must own, unless your locked into Dogmatics..in which case avoid this book and stay happy (and oblivious.)"
3,Not a Stellar Collection,"I had high hope for this collection; loving Gorey and his bizarre sense of humor I expected him to find an odd collection of great stories. Unfortunately, they are mostly mediocre (to my mind), and with very few exceptions not chilling or startling at all.There was one fantastic story, though: ""August Heat"" by W.F. Harvey. I'm grateful for this entire collection, for that one story. It is short, tight and incredible. Not a ""ghost story"", so to speak, but a chilling one none the less. I highly recommend it and was thrilled to find that others liked it enough to type it up online. I found several places, so look it up and read it--you'll thank me later.The best part of the book, of course, was the full page illustration, incorporating the title and a bit of the story, before each selection. For a Gorey fan, that made it almost worth slogging through the not-so-good stories."
3,OK but excessively earnest,"I am reading books to my 89-year-old mother. We enjoyed ""The Unsavvy Traveler,"" subtitled women's COMIC tales of adventure. But despite the promising title, the ""Hot Flashes"" stories generally aren't funny. Many authors seems to be struggling to find something profound to say. All in all, a disappointing read."
1,Great short story,So glad to see a Harold Coyle book out. He is the best of the best at telling a story and this story is terrific. The problem is that it would make a great short story for a magazine not a hardcover book. There is one small scale battle in the entire book that takes a few pages to tell; the rest covers the tedious details.It's a great story but not at the hardcover price.C'mon Harold!
1,A book to tide you over till a good one comes along.,"This book is a disappointment. Hastily written and poorly edited, it should never have reached publication in its present form. The story never becomes sufficiently believable for the reader to immerse himself in it. Whenever there might be a chance of this happening some horribly tangled sentence or ludicrous malapropism pops up. It is as if the text has been carelessly dictated, transcribed by a person unfamiliar with the words and never proofread. For instance, ""eek out a living"" ""screw the pouch"" and ""gapping mauls"" (instead of gaping maws) should certainly have been caught before publication.The book is largely an account of the difficulties of an poorly prepared reserve unit being called for active duty in the Middle East. While a worthy subject, I think most Harold Coyle readers are looking for more action. The small portion of the plot that could be described as an action story is unbelievable to the point of silliness."
1,Disappointing Coyle,"I've been a keen and admiring reader of HC for several years.His ability to create powerful military tales is outstanding.'They are Soldiers'is a real disappointment. HC's understanding of the complex dynamics of the Mid East is surprisingly poor and he creates comic book characters (a senior Mossad agent who uses phrases like ""he won't be playing the violin again"" after interrogating a palestinian suspected of biochem warfare - come on Harold, do your research; Shin Bet do the interrogations and Israel has returned so many palestinian prisoners each year without any suggestion of torture since 1985. And a Hamas/PLA biochem warfare lab under a Crusader castle in Israel? Get real!"
1,a must-avoid!,"tedius, cliche-ridden prose. this book is enervating to the point of outright annoyance. an insult to the paper on which it was printed."
2,NOT his best,"A plausible setup marred by flawed execution. While Coyles early work (Team Yankee, Sword Point, The 10.000) is among the best (both plots and writing) military fiction I have read this latest work is marred by two fatal flaws, to much emphasis on military procedure which detracts from the action and an seemingly absense of editing after the work was written (which in addition to the writing could have also corrected the former flaw). Also the plot while overal believable - and disturbing - has a fatal flaw. The introduction of a biological weapon is handled so clumsily that it is hard to believe that the author has done any research on the subject let alone spoke to any person with even elementary knowledge of virology or epidemology.A good read for fans of the genre and this author, otherwise - especially if this is your first outing into military fiction - there are many books that are a lot better. Some of the best mentioned above by this author."
4,coyle comes back,As usual a strong well written novel with a familiar storyline.A word of warning - read 'against all enemies' and God's children' first.
2,"Doesn't fit Savage 111 7mm Rem Mag w/ 24"" barrel",The guide does not fit all the way into the bore. The little locking pin is to close to the tip. I had to cut it off and melt/glue it in the correct place in order to get it to work... Hopefully it will stay so I can use it.
5,Amazing & Enlightening!,"Are you seeking enlightenment and direction for the next step? Do you need a confirmation of what you have already been contemplating? If you are wondering about your spiritual life and asking, ""What's the point? Why am I here? God where are You? or What's next for me?"" you will probably benefit from reading Price's straight-forward talk. It is well written and easy to read. Not ""religious"" but he brings you to You/Self/YourSelf/HigherSelf and ....that's all I'll say for now.Personally, it far-exceeded my expectations. (Actually, I did not know what to expect.) A friend highly recommended it as I was preparing to fast. It has aided my spiritual growth tremendously. I take it with me everywhere! I was sitting in a recital with tears streaming down my face while reading pages 27, 28. So, for me, reading it has been a mind-blowing experience. So many ah-ha moments. It is just what I needed at this point in my life. Truly amazing...I would highly recommend it."
3,An interactive proceess,"A Spiritual Philosophy for the New WorldAn easy to read, but difficult to practice the program. It requires a daily disicipline for 60 days of ""letting go"" of all that is important.Any holding on is captured by negative feelings. I'm not that skilled or that smart. Clare B."
5,Simply Gorgeous,"The vase is simply gorgeous. The crystal rose stands out beautifully.I bought this to give as a gift for a 25th Wedding Anniversary. I received it in good time and good condtion. Needless to say, the couple was more than pleased when they opened their gift."
5,"Excellent, A Masterpiece, Awesome & Cute!!!","Too good an item, to be presented as Gift for any Occasion... This, for sure, is going to Impress the recipient. I had gifted to this to my friend (Girl:-)), and the response to this one was...Awesome... was well received... and 'reached' the person! This looks too cute & wonderful when seen raw, than in these images... Worth purchasing...gifting... and the Shopping experience too was splendid... I had asked for Two-Day Shipping (with few extra bucks), and to my surprise, it reached a day earlier, well on time... to impress the occasion!!! All in All... A Nice one...! Impressive...!!!"
4,Fine for Poe's Fans,"This is a nice compilation of Poe's stories. It was bought as a Christmas gift for a fan of Edgar Allen Poe. It was a pretty good quality paperback, but I felt it was a little lightweight. Still, for the price it was a good deal."
5,Superb Light,"Small, but exceptionally bright, this light outperforms any larger lights I've been able to match it against. Shining it on a huge eucalyptus tree outside our house, I'm able to see details at the top, something that no other light has allowed me to do."
2,E2D EXECUTIVE DEFENDER,"VERY NICE LIGHT AM USE IT IN THE DESRT BUT ONLY 5 HOURES USED AFTER THAT THE LAMP NOT WORKING??? , AM HAVE SCORPION fLASHLIGHT AND STILL USED IT 2 YEAR CHEAP ALSO FEEL STRONG THAN E2D , FOR BETTER USE SCORPION FLASH LIGHT , THANKSAHMADKUWAITaaaaxx30@hotmail.com"
4,"Awesome flashlight, a little outdated!",Do not get me wrong I love this flashlight. The design and construction is first rate and the quality is unmatched by any other manufacturer. My only wish is that it was brighter than 60 lumens. Surefire is just now catching up to other torch manufacturers who now produce 200+ lumen LED bulbs with multiple lighting modes. The incandescent bulbs are a thing of the past. To surefires credit they have recently produced the E2DL model that is an L.E.D version of the E2D that produces 200 lumens on one setting and 5 lumens on another setting to conserve battery power. I love this torch for it's self defense features and there is something to be said for the 60 lumens it does produce. This is still enough light to blind an attacker and the incandescent light is more natural than L.E.D light. I gave it 4 stars because It's younger brother the E2DL is the better option if your willing to spend the extra 40 dollars. Overall it is a first rate torch.
1,Very disappointing...,"There are 51 cuts on this CD, and the way they do that is by playing abbreviated versions of each song. Which is a terrible idea... children like repetition and, frankly, I would like to be able to sing more than one verse of some of these songs to my baby! All there is on this CD is the first verse (chorus) of each of 51 songs."
3,Not for me,"If you're looking for a fun belly dance workout, this isn't it. The cover picture is very misleading. I thought it would be more like the Neena/Veena workouts, with middle eastern music, belly dance inspired moves and workout attire. Well, they kept the music, but both the workout and clothing are very basic '80s stuff (suspender leotards!) and very ""same old same old"". If I want a good mainstream workout, I'll stick to masters like Kari Anderson. If I want a belly dance workout, I'm going back to Neena and Veena, Fat Chance Bellydance, Shamira, Dolphina and the like. BUT... However useless this tape is for me as a workout, I gave it 3 stars because of the 3 women's performances and costumes shown afterward, which I did enjoy and made me feel much better about buying the tape. The gals are very talented (love the sword dance!), seem like a lot of fun and have great personalities...just wished they'd included those moves in the workout!"
1,Negative Self Esteem Messages,"Although well intentioned, the key problem with this book (like so many others on this topic) is that the author assumes your child already has low self esteem issues (depressed, lonely, no friends, etc.) that will all be resolved with hearing aids. I would prefer the book started assuming your child has a positive self-image and not a depressed victim (i.e. I like Soccer, etc, etc, but sometimes I don't hear so well). Sadly, we decided not to read this to our child so as to avoid sending the wrong or negative message."
3,nice set,"Overall, a nice product. It could use just a couple more pieces of track because the corners are tight for the train to get around without coming off the track. Also, the ratio of police characters to civilians is alarmingly high. I know kids like police and fire trucks, but this set has too many of the former. Just regular, peaceful folk for this kids' toy, please."
5,"Good quality, adjustable angle and portable","This is high quality music stand. It's very strong and very stable. The prop on the back (which is a little stiff and won't move without a firm hand) pivots so that the stand can be virtually flat for storage or to adjust the slope of the stand for your music. If the prop ever got loose it has a large screw and nut that could be tightened. The main part of the stand has two felt table protectors on it and it sits nicely on a table or where ever you wish to place it. The only disadvantage is the height is not adjustable but you could choose a different table, coffee table or a dining table or put some books under it if you wished."
4,I have a Old Nokia 6680,I have loads of back up phones spare phones as such one of those phones is a Nokia 6680 i cant charge it on the normal charging point faulty contacts i have a new battary for it which works with phone. So im wondering if i can use this USB Cable for charging the 6680 with Let me know thanks.
4,Quality cable,There is not too much that can be said about a cable. It does the job it was intended to do and the quality is good enough that it should continue to do its job for the foreseeable future. This cable meets those criteria.
2,Only worth what it cost,"This item is an after market cable. It doesn't fit my phone very well even though it is listed as being compatable. The original cable worked much better. This one will not stay connected to the phone. It keeps slipping out and braking my connection and causing my ""synch"" to fail. I have to physically hold the cable in place. The locking device doesn't work. At a cost of $1.00, that's all it's worth."
4,Did what was needed.,"I received the Eforcity Nokia CA-53 Cable, albeit rather tardy from the USPS. The cable needed the newest driver from Nokia to work and so I downloaded it and it worked well. Good investment for the money...much cheaper than from Nokia."
1,"Incompatible for Nokia E62, E61 devices","The CA-53 cable is not compatible with the Nokia E62 phone, despite the title of this product which indicates that it is. The Nokia E62 ships with a DKE-2 USB cable anyway."
2,Didn't work for Nokia 6070,"The cable looked good, and it had a cd in the package containing windows driver installation. Installation was a breeze, but it failed to recognize my Nokia 6070. I just wanted to copy all my contacts before I threw away my old Nokia 6070, but, luck dind't favor me this time."
1,plastic footbase broke and now its useless,I bought this cable 3 months ago but its plastic base foot broke and now it will not remain in the phone. The company will not replace or refund. Just waste of money. Very poorly made cable.
1,As cheap as it gets,This cable is really too good to be true. The price for this cable is unbelieveably cheap..and so is the quality! The connection piece broke off after my very first insert of the cable.That's what you get for a buying cheap!
5,Nokia Phone USB Connecting Cable,"Excellent utility USB connectivity cable between Nokia Mobile Phone and the personal computer. It allows for storing, preserving, and securing all data from Phone to the computer, it helps prevent the loss of phone-stored data, and interact dynamically between the mobile phone and the computer. I highly recommend having this very useful Eforcity Nokia CA-53 compatible USB Data Cable."
1,Frustrated,"I feel foolish having even considered purchasing this item. The price should've been my red flag but I still gave it a try. A crutial piece of plastic broke off of it as soon as I plugged it into my phone and then remained there, thus creating a new project of removing it. Most importantly, the cable doesn't work with Nokia phones, the company claims it does, but Nokia's drivers can't read it. I fought with this thing for hours, then broke down and called Nokia only to find out that most third party cables are not compatable. However, Nokia's representative was extremely knowledgable and helpful and that did reduce my frustration. Thankfully I paid next-to-nothing for this product. I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE USELESSNESS OF THIS ITEM."
3,Nokia Compatible Phone Data Cable,"The price was right and the product came promptly but the accompanying CD did not work at all, however I was able to download the software from the Nokia to get it to work and once that part was figured out it does the job just fine."
5,Works PERFECT on our Nokia 2156 Cell Phones!,Not a single glitch. Fair priced and FAST shipping. NO problems or hassles connecting and syncing using Windows XP OR Vista. What's not to love?
1,cable,"i haven't got the package yet.i made a mistake on the address. the correct address is :4823 hwy 58 b.chattanooga, tn 37416."
2,Unreliable,"Bought my cable last year and only used it for a couple of weeks before I decided to replace it with a cable from Nokia.This Eforcity unit is made of cheap-feeling material. Takes a bit to plug into my computer and once it is in, still doesn't work a lot of times. So I had to unplug and go thru the process a few times.Yes the price is low. But overall the item is too unstable."
4,Met expectations,My phone did not come with the cable so I was struggling to transfer my music from the phone. The cable just made syncing and transferring files so much easier.
5,Darling baby doll!,"This doll is just gorgeous! My 3-yo daughter wants Santa to bring her a baby with curly hair for Christmas, and she is going to be so thrilled with this doll. Melanie has beautiful eyes/eyelashes and silky hair (attached wig). She has soft arms and legs above her vinyl hands and feet, so she wouldn't look right in a short-sleeved outfit. This might be an issue for someone else, so I thought I'd mention it. She comes wearing a beaded name bracelet and carrying a soft blanket. Both the blanket and her gingham outfit are appliqued with a baby chick. I can't comment on Melanie's durability as she will have to stay in her pretty gift box until Christmas, but she seems to be very well-made.I did purchase this doll during Amazon's Toy Savings Event for $23. She is a steal for that price! However, I wanted to add that I wouldn't pay $60 for ANY doll which was going to be played with by a young child."
4,Very helpful,Very helpful overview of the workings of an Elder. Some cultural insights/translations are needed but overall very much worthwhile for Elders and aspiring Elders to read.
3,Made in China-Not in England,I was disappointed to learn that this Spode pattern is now made in China. The quality is not the same as my other dishes made in England.
4,completes the Christmas serving dishes,"Very nice set, small but functional for those smaller Christmas parties. Wish there were a handle on the top of the butter dish, a little hard to grasp. Recommended"
5,psychological aesthetics,"This book is one of the classic books of expeirmental aesthetics. It is very important for person who study aesthetics and philosophy. It is the best that someone could sale of borrow this book for me to use for some, because the book is out of print."
1,MADE IN CHINA -Brooks D-Shaped Tool Bag,"The Brooks D-Shaped tool bag is indeed beautiful and once had the pedigree that made it worth the money to purchase. That is until now, when one actually reads the small print on the back of the box that says Handmade in China. REALLY, the bag still cost like it was handmade in ENGLAND. Don't buy it if you think you are purchasing a piece of riding history!!!"
1,didnt work for me.,"I guess you get what you pay for. It didnt work for me, my dvd player still won't read 95% of my discs. Even if they are brand new, it seems to only like my blu-ray disc's. Pretty bummed."
4,A Well Written Mystery; Insider's View Of TheFashion Mileu,"I would have given this book 5 stars except for the ending, which I found disapointing. Yes, the novel's mystery is solved but the hero ends up where he started. That is not my idea of the ending this book deserved. The look into the world of a major fashion magazine was terrific. Good characters and a plot that kept me guessing. The author writes very well. If only the ending showed some progress or some promise for the main character! Glad I read it, anyway."
4,Wonderful summernights thrash/thrill,"The story is quite simple; the editor/owner of a society magazine gets killed and her antipode in life, her brother, takes over as an editor. At the same time he plays the sleuth and finds out who killed her. What makes it a good read is the nice ""behind the scene"" view of the glossy magazine world.If we have to believe the writer ( and why not, he is a BIG player in this world) it is a ruthless and dangerous environment, interesting enough as background for a well developed thriller. The dialogues are OK and the plot has enough twists to keep the tension in the novel...in short, good fun for a nice long summernight"
2,OVER MY HEAD !!!!!,"I am interested in quick, easy salads, but these were too complicated for a novice cook such as myself. And after a long day at work in the emergency room of a major city hospital, I don't have time for the exacting and time consuming prep work. I cook to relieve stress, not add to my own. Even the dull quality of the photographs, didn't enhance my desire to make any of the salads. I have the chef's cookie AND chocolate book and were were PLEASED with those, thats why I purchased the salad book, unfortuneatly, I was very disappointed. Maybe I'm just a baker at heart. I guess I'll stick to chocolate as a major food group."
5,Packing becomes a magic trick!,"I love to travel. But packing is such a chore with airline regulations. This item makes packing and traveling a breeze! It is amazing how many garments you can put in this folder. I am plus size and I can load almost all of the clothes for a trip overseas in a small folder which I can hold with one handle. Even better, items do not shift when luggage is moved. And if folded carefully, they come out looking fine. We were given a second Pack-it folder and are set for our trip."
3,comfort zone,"I find comfort in the fact that it has been shown by the book that there are many ways to live and look at life. I believe that being called old is not a sign of disrespect but an acknowledgement of survival and joy. I have learned far more from the old folks than I could have on my own. Read the book very close and you will see that almost all are childlike in the way that they enjoy life. You have to love the way they look at the young, with respect and love. I would love to meet these people and thank you for showing them to me."
5,beautiful glass prisms,"I purchased a package of 10 glass prisms for an old lamp purchased in 1956 that I did not want to part with when it fell off table and broke all the crystal prisms. The glass prisms matched perfectly on the lamp even though they were glass not crystal. No one noticed the difference. I am very happy with this purchase and I didn't even have to go to any store just went on Amazon, as always, found exactly what I need whether it be makeup, shoes, blouses, DVDs, etc. Very happy with Amazon. If there is any problem I can just return product to Amazon and they will refund. Saves me lots of time and I have always been 100% satisfied. Thank you Amazon. Audrey"
5,Excellent book on Truman,"Democrats struggling to develop a foreign policy vision in the post-9/11 world would do well to study Harry Truman's tough response to Soviet aggression following the Second World War. This book, based on years of primary research, is an excellent introduction to the subject."
2,I was right there with him...Looked him in the eyes and..,"said, ""That's him"", when the SWAT team brought him to me to identify. Oh, Lord, I still get chills thinking about that night. I wish I could have written this book, you would have had first-hand and colorful knowledge from MY perspective. But in the meantime, buy the book, turn to the photos, and you will see me there with Matthews, my partner."
1,Are you sure this is what you need?,"I thought ""pay the extra $$ for a genuine Motorola product."" With only 8 weeks of usage the ratchet/swivel becomes worm and moves too fast. The holder elastic starts to give and only holds the phone bythe base. As the ratchet rotates out falls the phone......with nothing to stop it but the ground. Finally got to 3 times a day and scratches on the phone attest to that.It looks nice but be warned. YOU decide if that's what you want! Me, I'm buying a plastic case to have no sliding problems again."
5,Seem to work just fine and good price,"I just needed a whole bunch of AA batteries on hand because we have a lot of things that take AA batteries. These were the cheapest, decently rated, big pack of alkaline batteries I could find. I haven't noticed them going out quickly or anything, although I don't pay that much attention to batteries unless I need to change them. The smaller (not packing) box they came in had fallen apart but they were plastic wrapped in sets of 2. I've been happy with them and I think they are a good buy."
4,"Good performance, shorter life","I bought these to use in my Kodak camera. The camera eats batteries like a rabbit eats carrots. For that reason the shorter life of these batteries is clearly off set by their price. The perform great, just for a shorter life span."
3,"Dated, but interesting none the less!","This book is quite interesting, but more from a historical perspective than anything else...While it may still be possible to build the computer shown in the book, locating many of the components would be very difficult, and would likely end up costing much more than a low-end system available today that can do much more."
3,Too little substance and too many clichés....,"I really wanted to like this book. The first half of the book is well-written, and brings up good points. But the second half of the book is very light on substance and uses clichés everywhere one can see. I was also embarassed to read about the cross-national case study, as it hinted at xenophobia.The one rather good aspect of the book is its bibliography, since it provides narratives along with the books."
2,"Not bad, but not good either.","There are a few bright spots, but for the most part this book is just plain common sense. The guy does seem to know what he is talking about, but doesn't do a great job conveying that to the reader. The writing style was just plain annoying and the book constantly went off on tangents (ex: ""The philosophy of da Vinci"", ""Why you should read classical literature"", ""Anti-patterns"").At one point after reading an entire paragraph explaining why he used the word ""forecaster"" rather than ""prognosticator"", I put this book on the shelf in disgust. The author obviously has a thesaurus and a copy of Barons and uses them liberally. The theme of the book seems to be ""look how smart I am"". What I equally annoying is that this book is written like an informal e-mail at times, for example he inserts ""just kidding"" and personal annecdotes completely unrelated to the topic throughout the text. Overall there was a heck of a lot of filler in this book."
1,Very poor,"Well, I'm always looking for good books on this subject, but sadly I can't recommend this book to anyone.You would be far better off with ""Peopleware"", which I would unconditionally recommend."
2,Spaces to expensive,"I bought the book in the knowledge there would be some formatting problems. I thought I could live with that.Boy, was I wrong! There is a huge lack of spaces between words. I think every page on my Kindle has a few missing spaces. And it really distracts from my reading experience. In the end, I put the book down at 20%. There's a lot of books out there, good books, whose authors actually proofread the book and/or used a spellchecker.I don't think the story is bad, it could actually be quite good, but I for one would prefer to have bought another book."
2,Save your money,"This book was pitiful, I would like to say I read it, but it bored me so much I set it to my DOG file after abut 10 percent."
1,Do Not Bother,"This title was sent to me accidently and after viewing it am sincerely glad to be rid of it.This first problem is that there is no translation in any way from Japanese to English. The second is that (being unable to decipher what is being talked about) you wonder what the point of all this softcore nonsense is. The camera work is terrible and often on the rapid ""zoom ins"" on the face you involuntarily jump back.Further, while Jun Kusanagi is an attractive woman, she does not have the chasimatic beauty of her contemporaries that makes this sort of weak offering have even a voyeristic interest.Basicly what you get is a lot of topless exposure from different costumes and a lot of talk that means nothing if you don't at least understand the language.Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs."
4,Not his greatest..,"This cd was okay. I wasn't pleased with it, but i wasn't dissapointed either. If you really like jacky, buy this cd."
1,"Is this a ""made for tv"" movie?","I tried to like it, but I don't believe or care about the characters in this story. I live in Southern California. I read this novel hoping for insight or a connection. I got nothing more than cliches. This book is a one dimensional waste of time."
3,Drama In Palos Verdes,"The Tribes of Palos Verdes was an okay book. There are a few exciting parts, but a ton of dull points too. As I started reading, I could tell right away that this book would be boring except every once in a while something big would happen, and it did, but not until the very end. The end of the book was the best because so many exciting events happen.This book was very easy to read and understand. Even though it wasn't all that interesting it was easy to keep reading, and not make you want to put the book down. I would want to read this book again some day because it is one of those things where you think you have everyone and everything all figured out but in the end you realize you were definitely wrong."
3,Not appropriate for children,"I enjoyed this book but wanted to find a book appropriate to give a young girl. The references to sex, drugs and even the downer ending made me glad I read this before giving it as a gift to a young girl.It isn't appropriate in my opinion for young children."
3,A sad story about a family after divorce,"The Tribes of Palos Verdes was an average book with very strange characters. Its basically about a family moving to a new neighborhood and how they try to adjust to their new lifestyles. Personally I did't like this book because I could'nt relate to the character's problems. I didn't care about what each character was going through. Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you like sad stories."
3,Flowing with the Tides,"This is a highly emotional story about a young girl who finds peace and serenity in surfing. This book is not as spiritual as I hoped it to be but, a good, thought-provoking tale."
3,Paging Holden Caulfield...,"Oddly enough, this book felt like an update to Sallinger's classic, with a west coast twist. Nicholson's Medina is younger than Sallinger's Holden (and a girl to boot), but the alienation and wry powers of observation are there. The author managed to get a feel of what the Palos Verdes area (and lifestyle) is like, but as a previous reviewer mentioned, the relationship with the twin brother and their self-imploding mother is a bit too much to be taken seriously...An amusing read with bits of dream-like descriptions scattered throughout."
2,Undecided,"I bought this book after hearing mention of it on NPR. I have spent many summers visiting family in PV, so I could visualize the scene a little better. But the story was just so-so. I'm not a big read-fiction-for-fun reader, and it scares me reading the other reviews that rave on this book. Is this book that good? I didn't think so. Troubled youth, ... sex episodes to spice things up, and the world crumbling around Medina. I don't know. I finished reading it, but I wasn't really on the end of my seat. Buy it used if you have to read it. Good luck!"
4,Interesting Fiction,"Although I enjoyed reading this fictional account of Joy's teenage years in high school, I couldn't help but remember the popular existence that Joy enjoyed while attending the now nonexistent Palos Verdes High School. I knew both Joy and her sister fairly well and do not remember Joy to be the ugly, awkward girl that no one liked. I actually found it quite entertaining trying to figure out who the supposed ""fictional"" characters were in real life. Although the names were not exactly the same, if you attended PV during that time, you can pretty much figure out who she was talking about. I'm looking forward to her next effort."
4,Not Entirely True,"Although I enjoyed this book, having given it 4 stars, there are some falsehoods that should be corrected. Having lived in Palos Verdes Estates for most of my life, and it being a smallish town, one knows things. Mainly, the author is not completely honest with us. Although a good story teller, she was not unpopular. She was ""Soph Doll"" a ""beauty contest of sorts for a sophomore girl. The way one gets this is, not only being cute, but being popular, because it is a voted position by the sophomore class. People who knew her also iterate this."
3,A dramatic story with surprising plots,"The Tribes of Palos Verdes is a boring book with characters that I did not care for. There was the over weight mother, the ugly daughter Medina, and the pathetic brother Jim. This book talks about how a family surives after a painful divorce. The plot of the story begins with Medina and her brother Jim going si\urfing. Then they met some new friends and started to using drugs with them. Later on in the story, the mother demanded jim to stay home with her to play games. He patheticly obeyed her demand. He gave up his life to be with his mother. The book was full of never ending problems and I would not recommend this book unless you like to read about a tragic story."
4,It was a very good book.,"I live in Palos Verdes and thought that what they said about it was kind of off. Not all of that is true. I was somewhat affended by what they said PV had. I liked the story line very much, but I would have liked a little more truth about PV."
3,Intriging with unlikeable characters,"I was interested in reading this book because I too grew up in Palos Verdes. I enjoyed the back drop of PV and did relate to some of the tone of the community, however, I found many of the characters to be very unlikeable and extreme. The mother was completely repulsive and very unbelievable. The fact that the father would allow his children to stay in that situation was outragious. He was completely spineless. I also found the girls at the high school to be unbelievable. Yes, PV High had its share of cruel girls, but not like these girls. They were portrayed as hoodlums. The girls at PV are cruel in a more subtle way. The author did manage to bring it together with Medina. Even with all her negativity, you knew she was strong. I would love to see the author expore more of PV in future novels. It was fun to read about this strange and wonderful place to grow up."
3,Teenager from PV,The writing and story of the book was very good but being from PV I found her over dramatization too much. Many of the PV girls are in no way like the book describes. Also she write a lot about surfing which isn't very accurate either. However her book was very good it just rubbed me the wrong way how she described the PV people and on gings in palos verdes because we are not all like how the books describes.
5,The Tribes of Palos Verdes,I loved this book because the details were very realistic. I was looking for a book for a book report and this book stood out. The Tribes of Palos Verdes was amazing. My twin sister and her friend read it and they loved it too. Medina Mason is an idependent and unforgettable character. I would definitely read other books by Joy Nicholson!
5,Great purchase experience,"The price is better than we get at local stores and the quality is the same. The vendor was prompt and the product was well packaged, arriving on time."
2,why less quality than the originals?,"If litter maid makes these, why is the quality so much worse on these than on the ones that come with the actual machine? Wait, maybe I can answer that....they don't want you to return that machine so they are a bit deceptive about the quality of their receptacles for your initial purchase. Come on...come on companies!"
1,Captive Audience,"I love my LitterMaid, and the recepticles that come with the machine are ok. These replacements are terrible. They are about half the thickness of the originals. So when you try and get a full one out it bends and spills. Due to the high cost of these things i try and reuse them, but due to the bending getting them out, they don't last nearly as long as the originals. But it seems like we are all stuck with them...for now."
3,"Good idea, could be improved, try a bag inside from petmate","I agree these are somewhat expensive - I wish they'd improve these by making it easier to lift a full one out to throw away. I don't know if that's something on the littermaid itself that should be improved, or the design of these to include a handle of something on each side that sticks up so you can pull a heavy/full one up and out of the box. I recently tried a petmate that has a reusable plastic receptacle to which you place little baggies made for it, and its very much similar sized to these receptacles. Returned that terrible box and went back to the littermaid but I have a few extra of the baggies and I am going to try putting them into this receptacle. They are designed to lift out and cover/tie all in one and that's the only thing I liked about the petmate btw."
2,Littermaid recepticles,"Very thin plastic, flimsy if allowed to get too full. Lids don't fit very well either. These containers are a bit pricey too. I think I would prefer a heavier reusable container."
2,Littermaid receptacles,"My problem with these is that they are kind of flimsy and bend out of shape easily. Truthfully, I've had problesm and been disappointed with the whole littermaid system. For what it costs, it should work better and be of higher quality."
4,Must have!,"This is a must have product for the LItterMaid Cat Box - this pack is much cheaper than pet stores because it comes with the filter packs. At pet stores, these must be purchased separately at quite a price.I highly recommend this item."
2,Flimsy Receptacles,The LitLitterMaid Waste Receptaclester Maid Receptacles are a disappointment as they are very flimsy for the purpose they serve. Should be sturdier to hold the waste that's scoped into them. Removing full receptacles can be tricky.
2,What else are you going to use with the LitterMaid?,"Cheap 'n' cheezy, just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are. Sure wish they would bring back the older, sturdier ones. Really makes you feel like a captive market, since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid. I line them with bags, but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid, so have to be replaced despite being lined."
1,LittleMaid refills,"I love not having to check my cat's litterbox very often since purchasing the Littermaid; however, the refill containers are very cheap thin plastic. Will their poor quality make me stop buying them or using the LitterMaid? No. I will continue to take the good with the bad when it comes to the LitterMaid."
4,Better than the included bins,"Well, it's a bin, what can I say? They work fine. The LitterMaid comes with four of these in the box, but they are a little different. The included bins' lids never seem to stay on the bin cover. With these, I never have that problem. The lid stays put, the bin fits fine and they are easy to remove and replace."
3,Littermaid plastic tray,the replacement trays that fit in my littermaid electric cat litter tray seem to be made of lighter gauge plastic than the ones that came with the machine. As yet I have not had one split and dump the litter everywhere but I fear it is only a matter of time. I was surprised that there were no additional carbon smell absorbers within the package.
4,beats the alternative,"This is a good thing. Overpriced? Yeah. But I don't have to play scoop for poop anymore. The cat's box being in the laundry with the dryer running can be repulsive. This is way better than cleaning the box several times a day. Yeah, the plastic containers are a little hokey, but everyone's gotta make a dime. My cat's almost entirely automatic now! I have a self-filling food bowl, a water bowl with a resevoir that filters the cat's water, and now, the lovely self-cleaning box!Considering my cat has a new fun hobby of sitting on the kitchen table at night, I feel much better going to sleep knowing that she's not walking on piles of poo four or five times a day."
1,Donate your money to a charitable cause....,"and don't throw it away on this.If you have at least one, line it with a plastic grocery bag.Clean up is easier and cheaper."
3,Litter Maid Rec.,These do not seem to be as sturdy as they once were. I don't use them as often since I have the perma-lid bag-it combo
3,"Littermaid Receptacles, 18 Filter Pack","I have to use these plastic receptables as I have the marvelous self-cleaning cat litter box. However, the plastic in the boxes and lids is very thin and cracks easily. Very disappointed but am stuck. EFS"
2,Not as sturdy as the older ones,"It appears that they have changed the way these are made.When I first got my littermaid (which is a wonderful product!) I got replacement liners. They were all white and plastic. There were quite sturdy and I would replace them monthly (I would give them a quick rinse if needed). So doing that, the cost of the liners were well worth it.However, these replacement liners are terrible! They are a clear, flimsy plastic that rips/tears very easily. I have found that they tear away from the litterbox holder (where you push the liner underneath so it catches in the holder) and litter gets spilled underneath the litterbox.I am going to try the suggestions of the other reviewers and line them with the plastic bags. Hopefully that will get me back to multiple uses, because the price is way to high for the quality of the product."
3,Here's a money saving compromise..,"I buy these but extend the use by taking those plastic shopping bags to line them. When I empty it, I take the bag out and tie it up, throw it out! I can use one of these for about 4 or 5 changes before I need a new one. You would think Littermaid would design a sturdy one, sell the bags, and make some money on that!"
3,Suggestion for saving some MONEY,Put grocery bags or small trash bag around the liner. That way you are able to reuse the liner and get your monies worth from them. I have tried this method and am real pleased. If you are creative you won't have to remove the liner and take the chances of breaking the liner. Even with the liner being broken it will still work.
2,"wasteful, not durable, don't make cleaning litter any easier","They fill up too quick, they're too flimsy and litter can fall out, they get stuck too easily. On top of that, they're too expensive and too wasteful. Stick with plastic bags, or better yet, toss your Littermaid and get a better litter box."
3,"these work, but . . .",why are the replacement receptacles by Littermaid thinner than the ones packaged with the litterbox? They can be flimsy when emptying- need to make sure the bottom is supported
2,Do not recommend,"There are three main problems with this product. The first is that it does not fit the littermaid box well at the base (where the box fits into the botoom). As a result you end up with some cat litter on the floor as a result, instead of all of it in this product. Secondly, the top part does not fit into the top well. Some effort required to get it in properly. Thirdly, the product is made of very weak plastic. As a result, if it is filled up, it bends quite a bit (to the point where it makes handling a chore). Higher quality/harder plastic should have been used to avoid this problem."
4,Designed to be disposable,"These take a lot of flak from people who claim they are too flimsy, etc. However, I don't think people realize that they are designed to be disposable and therefore aren't designed to be ultra durable. They are strong enough to last through one use, which is how often I use them. I can easily see them being more useful with a plastic bag inside, however for my purposes, I don't mind spending a little extra to replace them and make my life easier, which is the purpose of the box anyway."
5,great,"my order came on time, great!!! will keep buying my refills here.it is always nice when your order comes when they say it will!!!that is a plus!!!!"
2,The only game in town,"If you own a littermaid self cleaning litter box you have no choice but to buy these receptacles. I agree they are flimsy and not worth the cost but the company apparently doesn't pay any attention to customer feedback. If I wanted to spend quality time with my cat litter wrapping bags around the box, I would have an $8.00 litterbox and scoop it myself. I agree the manufacturer should be ashamed of this product."
3,Not Much Help But than Nothing.,"We love the Littermaid unit BUT the Waste Receptacles are poorly designed. The lid does not sit on the bottom very tight. The receptacles are so thin, I can't use much pressure to close the lid. I am always afraid I am going to spill the ""contents"" when replacing the receptacle. I think they cost way too much for such a thin, poorly made piece of plastic. But they do help hold the ""contents"" between cleanings."
3,I Have Flange Issues,"I find that the Littermaid works very well for what it is designed to do. The only truly unpleasant task is changing these waste receptacles. The difficulty I seem to experience is inserting a new receptacle. It is difficult to get the thin retaining lip on the tray itself securely under the plastic flanges attached to the litter box which retain the tray. Once it is in place, it works like a champ, but in a future redesign, I hope that the good folks that design this fine line of electric self-cleaning cat boxes will develop a more secure retaining method that facilitates easier receptacle changeout."
2,Inconsistent quality so far,"The receptacles I got with my first Littermaid (for multiple cats) were very flimsy. The replacement box of 12 (as shown) I got afterward were also flimsy. This did not stop us from reusing the trays over and over. It doesn't make sense not to, but eventually they get pretty brutalised from removal and reinsertion.Oddly enough, when we got our second LitterMaid (regular sized) the receptacles that came with it were sturdier and more durable. Why they arent all manufactured at this thickness is beyond me. Actually, I'm sure it's a case of trying to get more money out of us at cheaper manufacturing cost, but it's a little ridiculous when they are that flimsy."
5,"extra receptacles for LitterMaid, last a long time","I reuse the receptacles by putting a small plastic bag in them so I can just pull it out to empty.Sometimes the container cracks or something, but I have used the same receptacles for 5-6 months. If you don't like the bags, they are still easy to dump & rinse out.A good bargain in my eyes."
1,Littermaid Receptacles,"These would have been great if I hadn't returned the litterbox. Did not need them, so they were returned for refund."
2,Nothing smoky about it,"I purchased this eyeshadow because I thought it was a smoky gray - to me, smoky equals some brownish tint. It is a pure dark gray eyeshadow. Nothing wrong with it if you want pure gray."
5,great book!,"easy to read. A lot of details. This book covers how to organize office, how to do estimation.scheduling...and everything.Love it."
1,Massacre,"This movie is a disgrace, and a massacre of the original. It has nothing in common with the first 2, it shouldn't even be considered part of the series. It is exploitive of the bushmen. It has no clever humor at all. The people who made this have serious mental problems. If you thought the Gods Must be Crazy series needed hopping chinese vampires with dialog written by 12 year olds, you might enjoy it."
1,Gods Must Be Crazy III - Crazy Safari - English by Billy Chan,"Enjoyed the story. Unfortunately, this seemed like a pirated video - the quality was poor and the Discovery logo was on the screen for the entire duration."
2,He is not a scientist.,"Why would someone who does not know science attempts to comment on common scientific theories?Granted, relativity may be deep to those who knows nothing of it. But surely pop-science explainations are sufficiently easy to understand for most of us. (We still need the PHDs to crunch the physics formulas)Basically Mr. Turner's objections to modern scientific theories are that they are too strange to believe.I know I do not know enough Bible to properly comment on it. Why is the reverse not true for the Bible authors who write about science?The way I understand the distinction between religion and science is that religion is about love, and the way to live a life. Science is about the gas engine. You need to know how to live, but you also need a gas engine to drive you to work."
1,"Understanding Electronics 3rd Edition/R.H.Warring, Slone","Save your money. This book is full of errors, incomplete formulas, mis-labeled illustrations, and just simple errors. For a third edition, it is very poorly edited. All these mistakes should have been caught and corrected in previous editions. Some of the information herein may be accurate, but the reader cannot trust it to be correct because of all the other obvious inaccuracies. An unreliable textbook is worse than unhelpful to the dedicated student."
1,Cheap plastic gears.,"I used this ice cream maker 3 times. Each time it was very hard to engage the shaft with the gears to make it turn. It worked better with the hand crank than the electric motor. The third time, the electric motor would not engage at all. The hand crank engaged but, once the ice cream was soft, the cheap plastic gears would just slip. A tip: If you get it to work, the owners manual says to add water to your ice/salt mixture. However, it freezes much better without the extra water."
4,Good but can be improved,This press is strong and compact. It is pretty good. The magnet attachment easily falls off from the tool. It would be much better if there is a hole for a pin to hold the punch tips.
1,Poor material,"I purchased this for my granddaughter's birthday and was very disappointed. The wood was split on the top, I returned it and ordered another one and same problem. Would not recommend this cart."
4,Hairball Preparation,"My cats are crazy for this medicine! They get it twice a week, but if they had a vote, they would lap it up every day. It has not completely eliminated their hairballs, but it has definitely cut down on the frequency. Buying it on Amazon is cheaper than buying it at my vet's office."
3,Not the best.,"I have seen almost all the videos in the series. This is the least impressive. I was very hopeful, but was let down. Coach Fulmer mostly goes over drills, and they are good, but he does not talk much about playing offensive line. The other coaches in the series really get into teaching and have a lot more to share than Fulmer."
2,I thought it was a cd,"The DVD not cd arrived quickly. I read on the description that it was a cd. This is the music videos. The videos are good, but I can`t play it in my cd player"
2,poorly done & mislabeled collection for such a popular band,"Despite the sticker indicating the disc features a 5.1 surround mix, there is no such mix on my disc. The stereo track that is there is okay, but I haven't listened that closely to it. Perhaps it is marred by the dropouts that others mention.Yes, this disc is inexpensive, but so is Sony's new ""12 Deadly Cyns"" by Cyndi Lauper. The latter DOES actually contain a surround mix.I probably would not have purchased this DVD had it been clearly labeled that it was stereo only. Unfortunately, the packaging contains NO address or contact information for BMG special products. After surfing around on the web, I found their website with some email addresses. I sent an email to their Western US representative (I live in California) asking if the packaging was wrong or my disc defective. I have yet received no response (after two weeks)."
4,Best available option...so far,"Eurythmics / Greatest Hits (DVD videos): The only way, so far (as of Jan. of 2012), to get ALL of the Eurythmics best songs is to buy every one of the Eurythmics albums because their anthologies are all incomplete and unsatisfying. I do not want ALL their album for, as good as they were, they had a Lot of filler in their albums. Therefore, this DVD of their video hits is about as good as you're going to find until (and if) they release a Proper anthology (which will have to become available After January of 2012 because all those before this date simply stink).This DVD is good enough but has some very odd `between videos' stuff which at times gets in the way of the beginning and or ending of a video. Overall, it is good. Four Stars."
3,It's just ok!,"False advertisement, there is no 5.1 Dolby surround sound in this DVD,there is no bonus menu, no Subtitles or close caption , no lyrics, It has the best songs but also some others less known and kind of boring."
2,Bad Transfer,"A previous review goes into details about the poor transfer and the compression problems with this release. I fully agree. I'd also like to add that I had previously purchased the UK PAL version a couple of months ago and was disappointed that they used the same transfer for this US NTSC version. I was hoping the label would have cleaned it up before another release. So much for the ""Rush"" excuse.The two stars I give this is only for the transfer problems. If you're hoping to upgrade your copy from VHS, don't. Believe me, if you buy this DVD you'll hold onto the videotape and feel all-around cheated.As for the older material on this DVD, some of it is available on the Pioneer ""Sweet Dreams"" DVD. And while the sound quality on that edition is not the greatest, you won't be distracted by compression as much as ""Greatest.""Maybe ""Criterion"" can rescue this failure."
5,"Good, Good","This is a great video, has 21 of their videos on it. I find the transition bits between the videos to be a tad annoying, but not enough to detract from the overall excellence of the video. And yes, it does have the song 'you have placed a chill in my heart' on it."
3,The Hits and the Bonus Tracks Saves it!,"I must I admit I was a little disappointed with this album. On their first two albums there are some fine songs outside the hit singles. This is not really the case here. ""The Tide is Turning"" is okay, and the two hits ""Zabadak"" and ""The Legend of Xanadu"" are great. Fortunately there are some interesting bonus tracks on this recent Repertoire re-release. I particularly find the two Coca Cola songs quite charming. Also the single ""Last Night in Soho"" and the B-side ""Still Life"" are good."
2,Been done before...,"I probably would have rated this 3 or even 4 stars if the storyline was more original. The movie's beginning and end appear to have the same message which reminded me of the movie ""When Trumpets Fade"". That just ruined what I thought was an ""ok"" movie at best."
4,Realistic and Well Done Effort,"After buying this movie I was more than pleased, but also driven to see it after the two negative reviews from Canada that appear to be written by the same person. For the historian and uniform expert you will be in heaven with respect to the German impressions and vast equipment employed. One of the things that jumped out to me was the calculated effort to keep the camera on the real actors to follow the story vs using the re-enactors fill the void of film footage needed.......as with such movies as ""Brothers War"" and ""The Red Rose of Normandy"". Actually I felt the actors in Rhineland were good/professional and convincing, and the plot was historically realistic to the enthusiast. Yes I would recommend it to the war enthusiast."
4,AWESOME four STARS,"Great Film! Shot on a modest budget, Rhineland Spins a gritty tale. While watching this movie it throws you into a war no one wants to be in. You follow a cowardly private, barely hanging on as his world falls in around him. I was impressed with the Battle sequences. Not as flashy as a Hollywood film, but for an independent film this movie is fantastic. Honestly after reading a lot of reviews for this movie I can see why people would pick apart things like this. But I say this, I hate watching movies with ""people"" who blurt out, ""that's not a period rifle"" or ""that kilt was only worn by the McSosandso clan."" Really? It is a film, and a damn good one. I look forward to the future work of the 88mm Production team."
2,Rhineland.,"This is a very realistic movie. Uniforms, weapons, people, and equipment. The ""Not Rated"" for this movie is not very helpful, true it is not rated but the language is very foul. If this does not bother you, Rhineland is great movie."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this product after looking all over the web for a quality stainless steel, whistling teapot. I will say that it has visually pleasing design and the pour spout works as advertised, however the lid doesn't fit tight so the pot barely whistles! Instead of a whistle it makes a fluttering sound of the lid moving as the steam escapes from the top. The problems with that are a weird noise, hardly any whistle, can't be heard outside of the kitchen and the steam escaping heats the handle and can burn your hand.Comparing to my 10 yro teapot which has a wider base it takes a full 5 minutes longer to heat the same amount of water. Finally the instructions say to empty the pot after each use so the stainless steel doesn't rust!! I should have sent it back but I didn't see any other options without spending twice the price. So, you get what you pay for, though it seems that we are paying more and getting less."
3,Not For Beginners... maybe..,"First, this is a pretty good record, but in Nick Lowe standards it's not near his best work... of course there is a couple of real gems also on this album, but if you are a N.L. beginner, this may not be the first album to have... Man Of a Fool has fantastic tricky nicklowe-kind of lyrics and a nice melody and feel, How Do You Talk To an Angel is a jazzy piece, kind of song you sure dig if you like his recent albums, Time Wounds All Heels is nice too, so's Ragin' Eyes, but the rest of the album is filler kind of stuff, some of it is o.k., some kind of tongue in cheek made boogie woogie, but there is also four of five quite boring numbers you may be bound to skip... But, anyway, I never will sell my copy away, there isn't a bad Nick Lowe record made yet..!"
3,so-so in HD,"This movie is pretty cool, but when viewed on an HD TV the overwhelming special effects are overwhelmingly CGI. They video is still fun for the most part, but I actually prefer the Destiny in Space film that came on the disc as an extra, simply because the shots of earth from space are real, and from the best cameras possible. It's just more fun to look at."
3,Pricey for barebones and dated material...,"The PQ is above average and the material/concept is neat (unfortunately presented at a very high level i.e. for kids), but why I give it only 3 stars is that its completely barebones other than the 2 features on the disc. For the relatively high price I'm expecting alot more. Boo. Also, the computer generated graphics is noticably old. I'd recommend renting this first if you can."
1,Serious Reliability Problems,All three bulbs died after only a few days.These are a complete waste of money.I would recommend any other brand over these.
2,It's mildly entertaining. Mildly at best.,"The book is very short, and I did not find that I related to the woman at all. This would not matter if I felt I learned something from the book or was entertained, which I did not and was not. Quick, light reading but I did not love it."
5,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!!,"I couldn't put down ""When Will My Ship Come In"" until I finished it! Perfectly delightful! LOVED IT! It should be required reading for all Navy wives and future Naval wives!!!"
3,yankees bandana,Yankees bandana was perfect for my yorkie... just the right size and great material :)
3,awesome,"Cookie Mueller provides the words that her friend's photos cannot. Candid, honest and too true, her experiences maybe interpreted as party fantasy to those who have not lived the lifestyle they distantly embrace in John Waters' films and Nan Goldin's color saturated photos. It is pure talent that she is able to tell her experiences from an observer's perspective. I am so glad that she is able to explicate the stories of sinking a yacht, hitchhiking and partying in nyc with clarity and ease. One who participated in such odd circumstances is rarely able to articulate the insanity - which to me makes her writings most sane. She lives life."
2,Grade 1 Art Class,"This book just tells you about very basic colours. Not helpful to me in learning to apply colour in different lighting situations, in different combinations - no discussion of colour theory."
5,great book!,"This is the book I had been looking for for many weeks... I found it very comprehensive. Being not too technical (there are other books on the how-to), it gave me great ideas on what techniques are possible and what the implications of a chosen color might be. i had never thought of mixing paint myself! i like the fact that it's has a separate section on each major color, and that it includes detailed thoughts on color therapy and feng shui. the swatches at the end are great to work with. the only negative comment i have to make is on the color mixes photos... most of the combinations don't look pleasant to my eye. overall, i truly recommend this book!"
1,Not Yet Majestic,"This program has the potential to be a great tool for improvement at chess, but I haven't been able to use it because it keeps blinking at me every two seconds or so, which prevents me from reading its advice. When I explained the problem to Support, a member of their team got right back to me, telling me that solving the problem I described was his area of expertise. The screen then asked me how much I'd be willing to pay for the answer. When I didn't reply, it then assigned its own price for solving the problem, which was more than four times what I had paid for the product two weeks before.Does my experience help you decide whether to buy Majestic Chess? I hope so."
5,Excellent Adult Trainer,There have been people who have reviewed this for kids. First it is a computer program therefore it will do the same thing over and over and doesn't learn like people do. When you do a move on one level you can move to a higher level to see how somebody rated higher will move.The true beauty for adults or kids alike is for those who play on-line. When you lose you can setup the board and then switch to Grandmaster mode and see how he/she would move. Then flip sides and see how the Grandmaster would handle how to do it etc.If anybody can read Ne5 or Qh1 they should be easily able to learn (with some help) how to setup a board and switch sides and switch levels.No matter which game you buy make sure it has these options and Use Them!!!After you have learn the basics go online and play against a computer(first) and when you lose come back to this game and learn how a Grandmaster would do it.I can't say it enough. If you want to learn and I mean Learn how to play chess...do this!
2,Win XP hangs with this,"After reading good reviews, I purchased this cd. What I expected was great, clean, and quality fun product. But this has just fancy background and graphics,and takes 100% cpu usage on my computer (windows xp) and we both computer engieers and chess lovers and our son 6yr old are dissappointed with the purchase."
1,Does not run on XP SP2 or SP3,"I got this game in April 2010 and so far I have not been able to run it. I have tried it on a Toshiba XP-Home-SP2 notebook and a year old Toshiba XP-Home-SP3 laptop as well as a two year old Dell XP-Pro-SP3 WS without any success. After many hours of trying and searching for a remedy, I have given up on this software. There is a high probability that this software does not work on newer PCs."
4,Great for ages 9 + - may require parents help.,"Really nice game. My 9 y/o gifted Son is having a great time with it, however it is too difficult for my younger (nearly 8 y/o) son. Lots of great critical thinking and fun in adventure mode. My Husband really enjoys playing this with his boys.For younger kids with less experience and/or reading skills I recommend Aladdin Adventure Chess. It is fun, starts at the mostbasic levels and very interactive for the kids!"
3,So So.,Sometimes it works fine. Sometimes it hangs up the computer to the point that rebooting is the only remedy.
4,Good film for educators,"This entire series is wonderful! It is fun, fast-paced, historically accurate and visually interesting. It is particularly good for use in the classroom. Holds student's attention and is enjoyable for them. I would notsuggest this for primary educators. It is strictly an intermediate/senior series."
3,This book has not arrived yet - and it was ordered several weeks ago.,This book has not arrived yet - and it was ordered several weeks ago! I am very disappointed in theseller for not responding.
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"I am a HUGE Maggie Cheung fan and this film has been for years somehow escaping my viewing, so when I at long last saw it just recently I seriously could have kept waiting.There is absolutely no chemistry between Cheung and Leon in this film and the characters are so one dimensional you cant relate and you really don't care either! Cheung's character was a TERRIBLE mother who in fact left her child with a friend so she could move in with this rich computer genius in their shallow sexually driven relationship. Their is NO romance in this film and it is weak all around.If you are a fan of Cheung's I say skip it. It is a blemish on her great career. Actually even if you are not a fan of Cheung's I say skip it!Awful film and in no way is this a romantic or enjoyable film."
3,Too much talking,"This DVD was ok. I did not care too much for the interviews that they showed throughout the video. The picture seem fake or the lighting was not good. They performed, but something was off somewhat did not seem live to me maybe because they were on stage in Las Vegas at some bar or something. It was ok to watch but nothing I want to see over again like some other performers I have reviewed."
2,SONGS CUT SHORT!,"I bought the DVD wanting to hear the full version of the songs that were listed on the jacket. Instead these songs were cut short. I had my heart set on number 4 and 5 ""Chocolate Girl"" and ""I only meant to wet my feet"", and was disappointed. Maybe one of their other DVDs might be a better choice."
3,Song Selections - Not My Favorite,"The sound and image quality of the DVD is excellent!The Whispers are still one of my all-time favorite R&B; groups,but the song selections on the DVD could have been better.They perform all of ""In the Mood"" and ""Rock Steady"", butmy other favorites were abbreviated and buried in medleys..."
5,"Awesome, Dynamic, Intoxicating!!!","Just finished watching this DVD for the 4th time; can't get enough of it. The Whispers sing, dance, and entertain like they did twenty years ago. The sound and technical production is excellent and professional, the band is Off the Hook, and they sing all the favorites, such as ""And the Beat Goes On"", ""Rock Steady"", ""Lady"", ""Say Yes"", and much more; one of the best (if not theee best) video productions of old school acts in the music market place. All R&B fans should have this in their collection."
5,Good Things Come To Those Who Wait,Very good concert. They played all the good hits. It would have been nice to have the concert recorded in HD format. The sound is good. The picture quality could have been better. SUMMARY: A very good show! Good Things Come To Those Who Wait!!!
4,Excellent,"EVEN NOW is a heart wrenching story of love, loss and finding common ground in the middle of a war zone. A daughter's quest to bring her parents together after decades apart will bring tears to the eyes and joy to the soul. ---Author's Choice Reviews: Reviewer Cassie Scheidies"
5,Tear Jerker!,"I love this author. I've read this two-book series and love it. I bought a copy for my sister in law also. It's a sad, but good story! This author is very talented."
4,"""It all good""","This was my first time reading author ""Karen Kingsburg"" - Even Now. This book is somewhat parallel to my life and daughter, which we both were involved in a teenage pregnancy. The difference were the parents of hearing of their children news and just thought about themselves and not their child.We all go through trails and tribulation in our lives, but you must keep ""God"" and have faith in the Lord to see you through - good or bad!This is an excellent book and recommends for mother, father, sister or brother to read."
2,Too Many Improbables,"Karen Kingsbury's EVEN NOW is too thick with miracles for this reader. The overwhelming style makes the preciousness of a miracle seem mundane. Teenagers separated by parents and then 19 years later are brought together (maybe) by their illegitimate daughter. Even her search in this modern age is rather improbable.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
1,Maybe if I was 17...,"This book would be a great option for a teenager, with its tale of forgiveness and its clean nature. I, however, am not a teenager. I read this book because it was suggested to me. I of course wish that real people were like the characters in this book--loving and forgiving and all that comes with those things--but they aren't, so this novel just reeks of fiction. Not for one moment can you believe in the characters or their story. Beyond that, I felt that Ms. Kingsbury tried to draw in too many political issues, whether to press her own views or just for filler information, but regardless of the reason, it was nothing short of annoying.As I said, if you're a parent or a teenager, there might be something in this book for you, but it all felt just a little bit messy to me."
1,Yuck,"I picked this up as a single novel, as Kingsbury's series are full of filler. The plot was good ... and evolving well until about 3/4 through the book. Then it turns into a commercial for the Republican Party (by name), the war in Iraq and the author's own political views which she equates with Christianity. Terrible!"
4,A heartwarming story of forgiveness and the power of love.,"Shane Galanter and Lauren Gibbs are teenagers in love. Their families are best friends and the future seems bright until the unthinkable happens - Lauren gets pregnant. Their parents determine they are too young to commit to marriage so they go to extreme lengths to keep them apart.Lauren becomes a war correspondent and Shane a pilot. Though they separated years ago, their hearts are forever knit together. Then one day a phone call changes everything. Emily, their daughter, seeks to bring them back together.A heartwarming story of forgiveness and the power of love."
4,A must read for student's of U.S. foreign policy,"Full of important historical information and interesting tidbits of trivia, The Barbary Wars provides an excellent overview of the foreign policy challenges faced by a young and idealistic United States in exporting its revolutionary (and necessary) economic ideas. It also explores the often difficult job of making good foreign policy decisions in the face of seemingly unrelated, but nonetheless complicating, domestic politics. Lambert offers a work that should be viewed as important by historians and contemporary political scientists."
2,Not a very good read,"This book looked more promising than it turned out to be. The first issue I have with it is that is not a smooth, enjoyable read. It does not flow well and fails to produce any desire to keep going. to put is bluntly, I had no problem putting it down. The second issue I have with it is that it is filled with statements describing the motives of people and nations with very, very little, to no references to back up those conclusions. The footnotes are quite thin and often refer to short, rather uninteresting and inconsequential quotes.I was afraid of this when I read the first few pages of the intro where the author lets us know what his agenda seems to be. It seems he had an 'opinion' that he wanted to express and thought that 'his' historical perspective should simply be accepted as fact without reference."
4,Something Missing,"I ordered this double feature for the films but also for the special features, to get detailed info on production and visual effects, etc. I was suspicious when I noticed that the disc for ""Bad Boys II"" had the numeral 'one' on it - as if there used to be a '2' with it. Sure enough, the sequel ONLY comes with the film, no special features. I figure the BBII film used to be part of a two-disc set that got dismantled for this crappy bargain package. ""Bad Boys"" (first film) was fine - all the features were included on the same disc.Don't buy this if you want the full benefits of the DVD package for BOTH films.I give it 4 stars for the movies, not for the rip-off marketing/packaging of this thing which, honestly, seems a little bootleg-y to me."
5,Love this set!,"I can't stop watching these move! Bad Boys I & II play on our 55in 2 to 3 times a week, complete with surround sound and popcorn. The action is freaking awesome and our 5 and 3 year love it!!!!"
5,My Son's Favorite,I got this movie for my son Josiah. His favorite actors are Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. He is in love with this movie.
1,Not what is shipped...,"This product is presented as the Bad Boys I and II DVD. However, when it arrived, only Bad Boys II, 2-disc edition was in the case."
1,Bad Boys,"the stupid movies are in wide screen and it says nothing about that in the discription or on the boxes for that matter. bad boys 1 is not that bad tha ratio only dropes an inch on each end but 2 is horndus with about a 2.5"" black stripe top and bottem"
4,Action and Excitment,"Good movie for explosions and shoot-outs, and the humor is solid between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Not much else there tho, and the story is kind of corny and far-fetched. Sounded great on the home theater though, and was fun to watch."
5,Great Movie,this is a great movie package also its like getting to for the price of one i always like buying movies like this
3,Just what we need... more critters.,"This book wasn't quite what I was hoping it would be but is definitly recommended. Most of the pictures in it are available online at various website, though there were a few good never-before-seen shots. The book is layed out into seasons and covers most of the major creatures created for the series. The commentary for each is brief and mostly focuses on some quirk of the costume. I was hoping for a more in-depth discussion of how the costumes were made with some behind the scenes pics of the creature shop but sadly this is not so. Also, asside from some initial design sketches, there is little in the book reguarding Moya, Pilot, and the DRDs. If you're looking for a well laid out book with some interesting commentary and beautiful pictures of Farscape aliens, get this book. If you want behind the scenes info and refrence shots, get the DVDs."
4,A usefull guide to know the basics,This book is a good way to know the basics about rugby union. I think it is a good gift to a rugby player friend or a kid interested in this wonderful sport. As a rugby player I give 4 stars.
5,Husky Floor Liner,"Great quality and fit, have bought Husky floor mats and cargo liners before and they have always been first-rate. I would highly recomend thier product line."
2,Good Case with some flaws,The case fits good and looks nice but the button on it scratched the back of the phone and comes apart easy.When I am on the phone the edge of the case scratches my ear and its hard to get the phone on the clip. Other than that its ok.
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this base on the review, however I failed to note that the great review was based on a differnt edition. The book I as ordered does not have the maps or comentary cited in the review."
3,Awesome For The Price,"This was my first digital camera, and for the dirt-cheap price I bought it at, it was amazing! As long as you are outside, the pictures come out nicely. The fact that it doesn't have a flash makes it almost impossible to take pictures outside, and there is no LCD screen to preview your pictures, but for the price, it is fantastic.It can take short movies, and it can be used for a webcam, which is very nice."
5,Great cult 'exposay',"The author has written more than a few things exposing the truth about the Watchtower Tract and Bible Society, and this work is the result of a great deal of research into the leadership styles of the major movers. Read this and you will have a better understanding of how these men have been able to enslave and direct the minds of thousands of poor gullible people. In order to join this organization, something deep within you must want you to follow the wisdom of men rather than the wisdom of the Holy Spirit. Peter said it best: ""Resist the devil and he will flee from you."""
5,Great book.,It gives a great deal of background information on public life during the times of the Bible. It gets into somewhat on how what gave Moses symbolizes what a Christian should do in his/ her life.
1,"Cool Lights, Everything Else, Not So Cool","The plastic housing looked cool in the picture. In real life, it looks cheap.The documentation that came with the unit was poor at best.There was no hard drive jumper configuration information at all. I had to research that issue on the internet for myself.On a positive note, assembly was a breeze. That is the only positive I statement that I can make about this ULTRA unit.Lastly, the cooling fan became very noisy after only a couple of days of use.I don't normally write reviews, but if I can save any of you out there from wasting your money, my time was well spent.My plan now is to trash this housing and go with an aluminum ""heatsink"" type housing with no fan"
1,This is garbage.,"The fan noise is NOT a small concern. It's extremely loud. Even more alarming, first one then the other firewire ports have failed on me. At this point it's still somewhat usable, but if the usb port fails too, then the entire unit will be completely useless. Don't buy it!"
2,Avoid this one,"Doesn't have the Oxford chipset that supports firewire booting for Mac. Cheap casing, fan makes lot of noise. Otherwise works decently as powered external storage."
5,Perfect Case and Good price!,"It is my first review. But I have to say sth. It is such a good product that it matchs with my hard drive and makes it work prefectly. Also it is fancy and beautiful and light. Before buying this one, I bought two, one from buy.com and one from cirtuicity. But unfortunately, both of them don't work. The store is also OK. On time shipping and not such expensive."
1,wonderfull when it works,"This vacuum is very quiet and does a good job, when workingwithin weeks the telescopic wand gave troubles, and I must say Bosch was happy to replace it and within days I had a new oneNow, my vacuum is almost 2 years old and it only worked when wiggeling the cord,Bosch has very little repair centers, they want me to send it to NY for repair! A local repair shop told me needs new mother board, needs new reel with cord, cost over $ 300!So no thank you, I rather have a Dyson, they are more powerfull anyways and you don't spend a fortune on bags!"
3,This is not a paperback!,"I too was expecting a paperback, but if I had read the review information then I would have known and not purchased it. It is a simple version of the Max stories, but good for young children. My 5 yr old son loves all the Max books, even the board books meant for toddlers. But this one is too young for him to enjoy. This is a typical Max story for toddlers. I would definately purchase it for a younger child if I had one. It is not very interactive, but I was not expecting it to be one (since I thought it was a paperback). This is a good introduction to Max and his personality. I love Rosemary Wells and her stories, as do my sons."
2,Mediocre overview,"This book provides only a shallow overview of some of the many aspects of hostage rescue and dynamic entry. It may be suited to give an outsider a brief glimpse of what's involved in hostage rescue, but it has little to offer to anyone in the business. Billing it as a `manual' is somewhere between an overstatement and outright false advertising."
2,Not quite,"More of an outline than an actual manual. Get some insight into what's needed to learn a hostage rescue operation, but very basic, common sense information. No real, practical, training information."
2,Hostage Rescue Manual- not really!,"Well I say like someone else ""more of an outline than an actual manual"" and that is true. If you looking for room entry-tactics, well then this is not the book. It show basic information of what is needed to do on a HRT operation but still not enough. It show veichle and bus takedown but only basic, and if you have read other books on the subject then you will problably know how to do this. Don't think you can start a HRT group after reading this. I learn some things but not worth buying the book for."
3,Textbook Type Reading,Not at all entertaining and very matter of fact. Sort of like reading about sex via a chemistry book. I couldn't finish it. I guess I expected different. Not for the entertainment seeker. For that I recommend Rainbow Six and both Delta Force books.
1,Really Disappointing,"This was bought for me as a gift so I can't complain about the price, but the content is sadly lacking. Black and white photos and no substance. If you have ever been in the military or in law enforcement, you already know whats in this book if not more. This is more for archair commandos and wannabees then professionals. And it is certanily not, a how to manual."
1,A waste of time,The author writes in quite a few gun publications and I think he is nothing more than a blowhard liar. his stories about past experience as a bodyguard and association with elite forces do not ring true at all. it's no wonder that his books are so mediocre. As someone who has been there I can tell you this guy does not know of what he speaks or claims.
1,Feed-screw steel extremely low quality,Cheap Chinese junk. The feed-screw for motion in the long-dimension is of such poor quality steel that the handle-mount threads strip under the force from turning the motion handles. If it wasn't made from such low-quality material it would be a pretty nice unit. The design seems pretty nice--it was just made from really low-quality steel. We're returning the unit to MSC and hope to find a unit that's made from higher quality material. Not recommended.
1,The Big Dud,This movie features Mickey Rooney when he was a child. It could've been his big chance but it turned out to be a dud.*It's about fixed boxing matches and it got boring real fast. Mickey did what a child does and acts naturally. Unfortunately the other cast of characters robotic monologue took it to its lowest depth.*If you could get if free of charge then get it. Otherwise it's not worth the shipping and handling. This movie was one of a 50 pack Family Classics DVD movie collection.
5,Delicate Balancing Act,"I've been a follower of the Indigo Girls since their debut and this album is now one of my favorites. I don't know what it is that makes it so much better than their other recent albums (I have them all). Perhaps it's the production by Mitchell Froom? Perhaps it's the pronounced balance of Emily's more pop inclinations with Amy's darker, more Southern Rock? Whatever it is, it's very good and highly recommended.I just hope that this album doesn't get passed over. It's not getting the same degree of airplay as did singles from their other albums when they were signed with the major label Epic. In particular, Pendulum Swinger should be getting tons of airplay--very classic Indigo Girls sign-along--but alas, nothing. So I guess we all need to make sure we play it for all our friends to hear!"
5,The most constant band of our generation,"Needless to say, I am a fan. Always have been, always will be. This new release from the Indigo Girls just reaffirms that these two women are some of the best lyricists, musicians and vocalists out there. While ""folk rock"" may not be your thing, you may want to give this offering a listen. This CD is an evolution in all that makes the Indigo Girls one of the greatest bands ever known that no one hardly knows. And even though you may say you don't know them, chances are you have hummed a tune or two if thiers at one time or another. Give this CD a chance and chances are, you will be humming these tunes as well. Simply awesome."
4,Indigo always great,"I've only had time to listen to this a couple of times since I got it, but It is great as usual. So far, I like it just a little bit less than All That We Let In, which has turned out to be one of my all time favorites."
3,Re working,"This album seems to be more of the same, I have 2 albums already. I like their music and style, but this is a bit dull compared to Swamp Ophelia"
5,Fantastic new CD from Indigo's - A MUST HAVE!,"This new CD is really great, it is a finely tuned clean record, and you can just tell that Emily and Amy have been at this a while and really know what they are doing in studio. There is a good mix of songs, some fast, some slow, all new and different yet still familiar to long time fans. They are a timeless act - catch their live show if you can, they are fantastic in concert and these new songs live are even better and seem to slip seamlessly into their line up of older music. Get this one, you will not be disappointed."
5,Must have new CD from Indigo Girls - fantastic!!!,"This new CD is really great, it is a finely tuned clean record, and you can just tell that Emily and Amy have been at this a while and really know what they are doing in studio.

Get this one, you will not be disappointed."
3,My least favorite Indigo Girls album...,"...and I own all of their stuff. Actually, their Rarities album might be my least favorite, but this would be my least favorite out of all their studio albums. They just seem to have lost something compared to previous albums. I'm not a prude or anything, but there's a couple of songs with some F-bombs that keeps me from playing this when the kids are around, so I can't get into this one as much as the other Indigo Girls albums."
1,Not their best,"I love the Indigo Girls, but I have to say that I found this album pretty much unlistenable. And I really wanted it to be good. It's not the music (which is pretty standard Indigo Girls sound, fine by me, but nothing that you haven't heard before); it's the lyrics, which mostly remind me of the sort of thing that you'd write in high school. At best. Compare this to an album like Rites of Passage... well, basically, there IS no comparison."
3,Not really a memorable work (probably a 3.5),"I absolutely love the Indigo Girls. They're up there as one of my favorite artists, and I pretty much love all that they put out. This said, I do not think that they have done anything amazing since they released Swamp Ophelia. That album is a masterpiece, with each song having different and intricate feels. Now, their latest works (Become You, All That We Let In, and Despite Our Differences) seem rushed and sound pretty much the same. Same old lyrics, same old style. I do hope that they use more instruments in their next work (violins, chellos, maybe a sax), and try to do something more profund."
3,I miss the old Indigo Girls,"Recent albums have lacked the ""oomph"" and originality of prior IG efforts. Here's hoping they'll get back to being more aggressive and less standard folksy."
1,Froom!,"At this later stage in their career, I don't completely understand this album. After waiting years for it, I am surprised by how it sounds. Froom covered up what is most interesting of IG, 1. their voices, 2. their lyrics, and 3. their music. He ruined a good album. And how they allowed it, i dont understand, smitten by $$$$ maybe (signing a new record deal) Not to be too harsh, the songs are excellent. They show a willingnes to try new sounds (rock, punk, rap...) which is exciting, but, Froom covers up their voices. I want to hear the harshness of age...the imperfection of knowing...it is all lost in Frooms percussion and sparkling strings. I think they should recover this album, only use electric guituars and relevant percussions and lose Froom and MOST of all----put their voices out FRONT!!! Froom took an exceptional album and made it dull and worst of all, IG let him. ???"
5,Very productive reading,"The book is full of productive suggestions for writing on contemporary visual arts. For a foreign reader, it provides a cogent overview of different moments in recent art; a fine sampling of commentary on theoretical writing, and valuable insight into current art criticism in the U.S. ""The Return of the Real"", meaning by that the Lacanian ""Real"", is a thought-provoking, stimulating idea that runs through the book and has refreshed my own critical work. I am indebted to this book."
4,helpful and interesting book,It's a little conplex but appliavle to many kinds of contemporary art theories.
5,What a great video!,I thought this was a great video. I watched it in History class when we were learning about the Czars of Russia. I really recommend this video for world history teachers to show in class. I was amazed at the skill and time it took to design and construct each and every egg. If you are interested in learning more about these beautiful eggs this is the movie for you!
3,"Adorable, but busted","When I saw this cute little radio/CD player, I just had to have it. Unfortunately the CD player stopped working after 10 or so uses and now it sits in the kitchen on my old-fashioned ""Hoosier"" kitchen cabinet, looking like it's been there since the 50's, but useless except for the radio. Like the other reviewer's radio, mine is turquoise, not red, and it doesn't have any place for batteries."
2,It's cute but...,"My wife bought this for me as a birthday gift. Mine's turquois and cream. I love the retro looks. It played CDs perhaps a dozen times before the CD tray jammed closed and now refuses to open. Pushing the ""CD Open/Close Button"" results in naught but an angry buzz.The radio, in both AM and FM, works fine but I have a number of other radios. I want to play CDs.Memorex's online troubleshooting help techs want $25 to tell me how I can FIX THIS MYSELF, making my $50 unit a $75 unit.I am not at all happy."
4,Encouraging Imagination,"Of all the kitchens I looked at I wanted to ensure that it was one that would last a while. My daughter is two and just starting to play ""make believe"" She LOVES the kitchen. While it doesn't have computerized parts she can do all the things that mom does in the kitchen. It is just like a piece of furniture in the room so make sure you have the space. When she gets older I'll use for storage of linens or some such. Don't be put off by all the small pieces, it takes some time to put together but can be done by a novice."
4,"Grat, but a lot of pieces!!","My daughter LOVES this kitchen, however, it takes some time to put together and there are so many pieces! Definitely a 2 person project!"
2,"So Cute, but Disappointing!","I bought this kitchen for my three little girls (aged 5 and 3 year old twins) for Christmas. I think it is so cute, but not very durable. Right after I put it together, the piece that held the oven door on broke and that caused the screws from the bottom hinge to come out and i had to find longer screws to put it back together. Also, the next day, one of the screws in the hinge of the microwave broke in half so the rest of the screw is stuck inside. Lastly I think this kitchen is just not as durable as I thought it was going 2 be around my rough little girls, I needed something that could last under lots of abuse and this was not it, just yesterday they pulled too hard on the oven door and snapped the wood off the hinges. What a shame. I think it's still a great product, but not for my kids."
5,Wonderful play kitchen,"This kitchen is absolutely adorable and very well made. It took me about 3 hours to put together by myself, everything was there, and none of the pieces were damaged. The quality is very good and my kids were itching to play with it while I was putting it together. I have no doubts that this will bring a lot of joy to them for years to come. I highly recommend this kitchen for any child. It is just fabulous!"
4,Large Kitchen Review,This is a beautiful kitchen. Very sturdy and realistic. My daughter just turned six in September and she loved it. It was here in no time. I was really excited to see it and it paid off. A very great buy. Thank you.
5,An incredible kitchen,"I purchased the kitchen for the four year old girl I was adopting. The kitchen was delivered within a few short days of my order, which was faster than the date I was given. My friends set it up while I was away. When we entered my home we took my daughter to her new playroom and she began to gasp, then laughed and jumped up and down when she saw the kitchen. She immediately ran over and began to play with it. She is the size of a two year old and is able to reach every area of the kitchen. The colors are bright and there is plenty of room for storage. She has played with the kitchen everyday since we have arrived. I researched play kitchens for several weeks before purchasing and this kitchen is well worth the money. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a superior kitchen for a family member."
5,Awesome... beat my expectations!,"I looked all over the internet for a decent priced good quality kitchen set for my two daughters. THIS IS IT. It is VERY HEAVY and will last years... it's bright colors make ME want to play with it. Not to mention the additional storage... this thing holds STUFF! I can't wait until my two daugthers open this... their ""big gift"" tommorrow morning... Christmas Morning! Mr. Claus does NOT get the credit for this one... it's all ours!"
2,Better buy the Marco Polo's tales,"The video tries to develop the long discussion about the reality and accuracy of the Marco Polo adventure to China, but for that purpose would be better a different approach and a different offer to the public. This is not a biography about Marco Polo, no the history of the book or the analisys of why scholars dispute about the authenticity of the Marco Polo's book. The video tries to go in everithing of that and the result is a poor work about everithing. So, don't waste your money on this video. Would be better to buy some commented edition of the Marco Polo's book."
3,Aardvarck - Cult Copy,"Detroit techno, slightly raw: that's what you can expect on Aardvarck's CULT COPY. The slightly unfinished feel to the rhythms give the album its raw feeling, whether it's the unadorned drum on ""Start,"" the rough thump on ""Cult Copy 2"" or even the cowbell on ""Cult Copy Dub 3."" The beats are overlaid usually with one harsh element (like the buzz on ""Delsin King"") and then Detroitian chords that come halfway through. He does make room for some more contemplative pieces (the ambient interlude of ""Coma,"" the mellow electro of ""Buuv"") and sometimes the techno elements hit the right spot (the smooth ""Theme Park""). But the harder tracks occasionally come off as a bit directionless. Not so when he pays attention to the melodic elements, like ""Aardbij,"" which samples Isao Tomita's electronic rendition of Claude Debussy's Arabesque for a more graceful journey, or the solid tech-house of ""Komt Goed."" Good enough to start a cult? Not quite yet."
4,Trio de voces perfectamente acopladas,"El grupo mejicano Pandora, un trío de voces perfectamente acopladas no decepcionan a su público. Canción tras canción, Isabel, Fernanda y Liliana le dan al público lo mejor de su talento en este CD recopilando sus mejores éxitos. Su potpurri de melodías compuestas por Juan Gabriel es lo mejor de esta grabación. No se decepcionará de esta grabación."
3,doable,Video is doable but not new. The bottom of the video is fuzzy or snowy and somtimes the fuzziness scrolls up and down.
2,Contradiction,"The poems were beautiful and meaningful. But I had to return the book because it was a gift for a missionary friend and since there was an offer in the back of the book to purchase her other book about a witch's flying school, I felt this was not appropriate. I don't believe a person who is writing Christian poetry should also be writing about witchcraft, no matter how lighthearted the book may be."
1,Out of date and poorly organized,"This is one of the worst English-Arabic dictionaries I've worked with. It's terribly out of date and lacking many common words. Moreover, it's organized by root, not alphabetically, which isn't terrible if you're familiar with Arabic word patterns, but since it does not bold the root verb entries or otherwise call out where each root section starts, it is incredibly difficult to look up words, even if you know what you are looking for."
1,Woefully out of date and incomplete,"This is an old-style dictionary, organized according to roots rather than alphabetically. That's fine though. What's not fine is that it is missing soooooo many common current words. This dictionary is ancient. It's word list is WWI vintage. ..."
5,AN EXECELLENT BOOK THAT KEEPS YOU UPDATED ON GUNS & AMMO,"GUN DIGEST IS AN EXCELLENT PUBLICATION ABOUT GUN & AMMO THAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET TODAY. I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS BOOK EVERY YEAR SINCE 1980. DUE TO MY PREOCCUPATION I MISSED 1988, 1999 & 2000 EDITIONS WHICH I SHALL ORDER VIA THE INTERNET THROUGH AMAZON.COM. THIS BOOK WAS HELPFUL IN MY CAREER AS IT EXPANDED YOUR KNOWLEDGE MORESO WHEN I AM SO FOND OF HUNTING & SHOOTING."
4,"Amazing, but...","The book is a true complete guide to anything that shoots, even the airgun section is great..It also includes a wonderful web directory, index of every known maker's address etc..The only problem is with listed prices, some of them are little above average (I assume these are the manufacturer's suggested retail prices), While other prices listed are True market prices, which may confuse you a little."
1,last Blue Bloods episoid,"The last episoid on Blue Bloods was one of the worest that I had seen, I will not continue to watch this show if they continue to produce these type of shows."
3,Still good but wavering,Good show although some of the family stuff is getting a bit much. I do like the story lines but miss Jackie.
2,Season 3 got boring,"First it loses Jackie, then the writer must have just quit thinking, now it is just another show. Sadly it teaches young people to turn to alcohol to solve their problems as well."
2,You Get What You Paid For,"for the most part this is a good DVD player... but about 25% of DVD's i've played on ithave a problem, when watching a movie the picture will freeze, but the DVD still plays, and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments. Usually I just skip to the next chapter to avoid it. Annoying."
2,Disappointing - Get what you pay for,"The player looked good right out of the box, offering lots of features and good styling. I immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite DVDs. After ""loading"" for what seemed like a very long time, the display indicated ""No Disk"". After multilple tries, one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available. Only one disk played through to completion successfully. At $49. I guess you get what you pay for. I'd recommend against this unit."
2,Keep your receipt,"Bought two ad2600's for Christmas. One still works fine, the other quit after one day. Owner's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide. Apex's website is down and they won't answer their phone."
1,Lasted about a year,"This machine worked fairly well for about a year. It had trouble reading some DVDs and would display 'no disc' even though there was a disc in the player (in particular, I remember The Crow not working). Then, without warning, the DVD player would only play the sound and had no picture. Some had suggested pressing the I/P button on the remote to rectify this problem. This did NOT work, and the DVD player continued to display no picture what so ever. I double-checked all of the wiring to no avail. We ended up having to purchase a new DVD player and I will never purchase any Apex product again. You'd be much better off buying a reputable name brand or something hot off of the street."
1,Died and disappeared,"It died after 13 mos. To their credit, the company agreed to honor the warranty, so I sent it back. To their discredit, I never heard from them again."
1,Sure to Fail,"Like a cheap Rolex you get off the streets of NYC, this falls into the same category. Except those cheap Rolex once made in Hong Kong at least lasted longer that this Apex made in China."
3,Does not play DVDs with extra features...,"First of all, I bought this DVD as a Christmas present for my girlfriend and I am somewhat disappointed. Unlike some of the other people who received a ""lemon"", my DVD player came in perfect working condition. AS a whole, the DVD player has a sleek design and works fine. What disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain DVDs. For example, I tried playing my new ""Pirates of the Carribean"" extra features DVD, but this DVD player can not read it. AT first I thought it is only a isolated incident, but I was proven wrong when the player would not read my ""Alias"" DVDs as well. This player seems to work fine with everything else. So I don't understand why it would not work with DVDs that seem to have more features in them. Because of this, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product."
1,Returned after failing to play DVDs,"I purchased the AD2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews I read here on Amazon. As soon as I lifted the unit out of the box, I questioned my judgement. The entire unit was poorly crafted. There were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board. After hooking the thing up, I found that it would only played less than 50% of the DVDs I put in it. Most of the DVDs I was trying were fairly new and were in great condition. The DVD player just would't recognize them. It would spin, read, spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc. I ended up sending the unit back to Amazon."
5,A great discovery!,"I bought this to replace an expensive ($300+) Onkyo DVD player that quit after only 3 years!This has so many capabilities that you'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve. I use this with a home theater system and it's amazing how it sounds, the picture clarity is unmatched!So much packed in a small case and very affordable!"
1,great - for the first three hours,"I was impressed by this very inexpensive player...for the first three hours, and then it died. I was told that it is no longer available, so there must be something really wrong with it."
5,Reads miniDVD too!,"I bought this one just to test if it can also play miniDVD in addition to other video formats mentioned in other reviews. And I am very delighted to know that it plays very well my DVD videos made into CD-Rs. MiniDVD is the same as regular DVD but is burned to a CD-R instead of DVD-R. It's cheap to make compared to DVD-R disks, but can only store about 15 min of high DVD quality video. Most DVD players will not play miniDVD videos. Now only costing $39 with rebates, it definitely is a great buy!"
1,Piece of Crap!,Did not even work when we took it out of the box. We sent it back to the company for refund...NEVER GOT IT!
2,DVD Player Broke within 3 months of purchase!,"This DVD player broke down within 3 months after I purchase it.I first contact the APEX by phone, and was on the phone waiting for over 30 min. Once I told the operator what I need, I was put on hold again until the phone call got cut off.Then I tried to email APEX with the email address list on their web site, and email got bounced back.So I registered myself with APEX and emailed them about the problem. Of course, no reply either.Very disappoint at the customer service and the product quality."
1,Nice Paperweight,"I have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 DVD's, after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it's job. I have tried many times to get a hold of Apex who doesn't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as (I believe) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked. As I emailed to the the customer service department, the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red LED burning. Do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality, or at least works."
3,Apex AD-2600 working so far :&,"Received Apex DVD and the picture was great when set up with S connector... the remote is a little hard to understand... my JPEG pictures are viewable (not so sharp and vivid)on my 27"" screen but seem not as clear as when I view them on my 17"" monitor... so far the DVD works so I hope it doesn't break down like the reviews I've read. Prior to Christmas, it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad! I wouldn't gotten this DVD based on the reviews I read after Christmas...."
1,A Frustrating Christmas,"We ordered two Apex AD-2600's for our family for Christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch DVD's - well... the first one we installed didn't work, and our kids were devastated to say the least. The second one is up and running. It seems to be working fine, but we've not used it all that much. I am returning the broken one today. I will not be ordering another one to replace it.UPDATE: JANUARY 27TH 2004 - THE SECOND ONE CRAPPED OUT ONLY AFTER A WEEK - DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!"
2,"When it works, it's great, when it doesn't it's frustrating","Bought the APEX AD-2600 from Amazon in 12/03 mainly on price, $49.99 - $10 rebate = $39.99. That was a mistake. We tried the ""Finding Nemo"" DVD and when we got to ~Chapter 28, the frames started to freeze for no reason. Cleaned the DVD, tried again, no luck. I pulled out our old non-progressive scan Toshiba, hooked it back-up and the ""Finding Nemo"" DVD works fine. I agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for. I can't rate it one star only because when it does work it's pretty good. Only owned it about two weeks so I expect we're looking at getting another progressive scan DVD player of higher quality very soon."
1,A very embarassing gift,"I purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it, both here and in other places. After less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment, for myself and for my parents, for whom it was a gift.It played only one out of three DVD's without problems, the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches. Both of the problem DVD's would repeatedly freeze during playback, while the counter on the player kept going. One also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu.These problems were consistent, and also not present on another dvd player.The DVD door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed.There were a few attractive features, such as the small size and the layout of the remote.all in all, trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer DVD VCR combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift."
2,Can't read all DVDs,I've used player for 8 mos. now and noticed that it has lots of problems playing DVDs that are not new. I see all the time with DVDs from rental stores that has some finger print
2,Looks Nice.....Does it work....Sometimes,"When I purchase this product the reviews were all pretty good, however whenever I try and play DVDs some chapters are skipped over, and I can't view them!!! This alone would make me say DO NOT BUY!! It does look nice though."
2,Black and White Only after 1 month of use,This unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared. Apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy.
3,Price vs Performance,"For the price,it's a very nice DVD player. The front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close, a very annoying thing after ahwile.It does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice. And so far have not had any problems with DVDs not being able to play.Recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced DVD player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like SONY."
3,Moderately Impressed,"I just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers. No go on most formats. It plays original DVDs and CDs and plays mp3s and JPEGs. However, it does not play Windows media and I can not get it to play any of my divx rips. I guess that I can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd/svcd formats, but others say they can. Also, it was only $39.99 (after rebate) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player. Good quality video."
4,Best I ever owned...,"I am almost a year down the road with this machine and it is the most reliable that I have used yet. I have owned two Norcent 300 series players, a Lite-On 2002, and an older Sony and this one performs better and more consistently than any of them and has never failed to play any DVD or VCD that is playable on any other machine. I am not sure it is available any more, but if you can find one, grab it! The only problem that is kind of a nuisance is that it decides on its own when to close the drawer. Sometimes you have to be fast to grab or insert the disk."
2,2 Out of Three Ain't Good,"Thought I'd weigh in here with my stats. I've bought 3 Apex DVD players now. They play just about everything, but #2 and #3 died very shortly after getting them. I am back to using #1. Nice machines, but I consider their quality pretty low now."
1,Worst Piece Of Electronics I ever bought,"If I could give this a negative rating, I would. I am surprised Amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems. Won't play A LOT of discs. I can only confirm what other customers have said - crap! Some movies it played yesterday, it won't play today. It won't play 80% of my movies, which are all store boughten. Tech support from Apex is literally - NONEXISTENT. Amazon, do your customers a big favor, don't carry this item, and give them refunds! There should have been a recall on this product. Fair warning - DO NOT BUY.I repeat - Don't wast your money."
2,OK if you have a 2nd dvd player.,"I have had this dvd player for about 3 months now. Nothing has broken on it, and it plays all the dvds I have. Unfortunately it can't play all of the dvd. I have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode. On 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd. Luckily I also have a PS2 which can play those episodes the player can't. Unfortunately I bought a player because the PS2 couldn't play all my dvds, and now the player can't play everything."
1,"Good price, bad product","I bought this player as a christmas present for my wife. 3/4 way through the first disk we played on it (naturally on 31 days after purchase) the dvd player froze. Now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk.Have tried to contact apex via e-mail (customerservice@apexdigital.com), but the e-mail address is not valid. Have tried calling (866-4APEXGO), but can't get through.This product sucks, the customer service from apex sucks. I shouldn't have been cheap, should have bought a Toshiba."
1,Don't Buy This Player,"I bought this player and returned it within 1 hour. It took multiple tries to get it to load a disk, it consistently refused to bring up the disc menu, and would not respond to the play button.Apex has put out good products in the past. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.Avoid this player at all costs!Free is too much to pay for this player.(Yes, I am very dissappointed.)"
1,This is a piece of junk!,I bought this player (...). The player died within less than a year. There is an annoying problem: the media tray opens and immediately closes whenever you push the open/close button. I have to pull the tray quickly to be able to put my DVD/CD in. Sounds ridiculous? This is the worst electronics i have ever bought.I will avoid any products from Apex in the future.
1,I wish there was a negative number for review,"One word - JUNK!I did purchase another DVD player from Amazon, a Zenith that I am more than happy with. However, Amazon was supposed to take my junk Apex back, been waiting 2 months now... If you order something from Amazon (pay), it's here FAST, returning something...what a joke. Contact Amazon? That's another joke. See if you can find a customer service phone number on this website. You have to follow like 6 links and be a cyber slueth just to get an email across...Whatever you do, do not buy this Apex player, you will be sorry. It won't play several DVDs."
1,Customer service is non-existent!!!!,"I wish I could give negative stars!!! I bought this dvd player in November. I have an Apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today. I figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 I would buy one. What a mistake!!! After about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd's are dirty. I've tried several dvd's and even new ones do the same thing. I have Ice Age and it keeps telling me no disc. I've tried someone elses and the same thing happens. I tried e-mailing Apex and they come back saying undeliverable. I've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered. I just want to at least try an exchange but you can't get through to their number, it's always busy. That makes sense though, with all the substandard products they make. Do not buy this product or any Apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money!!!"
2,"Looks great, works like crap.","Bought one for $49.99. Seemed like a good deal, but this POSfrequently cannot recognize DVDs and music CDs -- takes a longtime loading and then concludes, ""No Disc"". Sent mine back.I'd look elsewhere..."
2,awkward remote; flimsy build quality,"Granted, I have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for Christmas, but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player. First, the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds. When I hit ""menu"" it told me, ""playback only."" I actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu. This is extemely lame. The remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use. In addition, it only seems to work if you're about five feet away from the player, although that may have been just the batteries that came with it. The player does seem to play dvds adequately enough. It also has an optical out, which it should. I think for about $40 more, you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though."
2,Good while it lasted.,"***Died in less than 30 days; no luck with getting manufacturer to replace or repair it***[my original review:]This DVD player (and CD player too) looks great, quite svelte and high tech. It has so far played any format I've thrown at it, and the video quality is nothing short of excellent. The audio outputs are adequate for most anyone's needs.I've had 2 Apex TVs for some time, and along with this DVD player, I must say they are very good performers at bargain basement prices."
2,Touchy player,"I ended up returning this unit since it would not play certain DVD's (all of which were store-bought, Region 1, non-restricted titles). It seemed to work fine for most of my DVDs but for some reason would not read a couple of titles. I decided to return the player and purchased another one (at the same price level) and have had no problems viewing the same discs."
1,It just doesn't work,"There are tons of people now who have posted reviews that say that this DVD player just stopped working on them. Well, that should hopefully give you a clue as to whether or not to buy this piece of junk. The same exact thing happened to me. One day it just stopped putting out audio or video, for no good reason that I could ascertain. It is now in the garbage pile waiting to be taken out with the morning trash."
1,Save your money,"This DVD play is basicly junk. It won't play all of my movies. Keeps coming up with no disk errors. I tried called APEX Cust service, no help. Don't waste your money. Mine was 2 weeks old and I chucked it in the trash, where it belongs. This is the 4 apex player that I have bought.. You might think you are saving money by buying an APEX but in the long run you will spend more. Each of the 4 lasted less than six months.. You can get a pretty good progressive scan Sony or Toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere.. Spend the money its well worth it.."
1,APEX 2600,The one I purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any DVD disc. It will read and play all CD audio disc. Guess I will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one.So far not going to get a good review. A disipointed customer.
1,the AD2600 had false silver plate instead of play display,"the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display. the case had AD2600. bait and switch. picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured, yet false silver plate. what is up. clearly a large LAWSUIT if I were so inclined. I feel that once I contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this."
1,Worst DVD i ever saw,"This is the first time i ever purchased products from APEX, and will never buy anything from them again. This DVD player is hard to connect, i match all the cables the way it is shown on the manual, but it does not work with any kinds of video input commands. The dvd player does not respond to remote control, and when manually the keys on dvd are used it takes long time for it to switch to a desired function. The technical support line is the worst service i have ever seen in America. Very hard to reach because the line is always busy, and once youu reach them the phone becomes disconnected and you start all over againn by calling the support center for hours."
1,AD-2600,"All I can say is you get what you pay for. I purchased this DVD player last week. The remote control does not function properly and the picture keeps freezing up. Do your self a favor and purchase either a Sony, Toshiba or Panasonic."
2,Frustrating!!!!!!,"Just hope you never lose/break the remote for this player! We've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work ""Apex"" dvd players and none worked. Called Customer Service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $23 (which is almost half of what I paid for the whole player). If anybody knows of a remote to work this-I'd love to hear from you! (on here of course) Also, a couple dvd's wouldn't play and they were new ones!"
1,Poor quality,"Only used for 3 month before it's down! I had hoped this was bought from WalMart so that I could return it! It sends discoutinous signals to TV, so the TV has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment.The other thing I don't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated. Maybe it's good for TVs with not so good color settings, but not good for my TV that already has very vibrant pictures."
1,"Keep shopping, don't stop here","I bought this as a gift for my sister. It has never worked. I've attempted to connect this unit to several different TVs, using a multitude of connection methods, and I still can't get a video signal from the machine. I highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase."
2,Problems,"I bought this player during a Christmas sale at an excellent price. However, I should have followed my instincts: You get what you pay for. One of the DVD's I received as a Christmas present kept freezing. Some DVD's I rented would not play. Now, I suddenly have no picture. I will say this. When the player was working it was great. But......"
2,Poor Customer Service,I had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective. It took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced. The Customer Service Dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line. I would not be inclined to purchase an APEX product again.
1,BARELY WORKED,"It only read the dvds 10% of the time, otherwise I would get a NO DISC screen. I got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back. Amazon was supposed to send me another one, but didn't and sent me a gift certificate instead (I'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since December)."
1,Dodgy. Get what you pay for.,"Ordered it cause it was cheap and seemed to have a lot of features. However, player has been nothing but problems. Often complains about ""No Disc"" even though a disc is inside. Need to power cycle the player for it to read, sometimes multiple times. Remote sensor is weak and you have to practically be right next to the player for it to register. Player sometimes *crashes* on a dvd layer change. Has problems recognizing and reading many of my dual-layer discs. Navigation of the mp3 and jpeg menus is terrible. SPDIF output has stuttering audio on Dolby Digital 2.0. The list goes on and on. Previously I had a Toshiba brand and Philips brand DVD player and they gave me none of these problems I'm listing here. (To be fair, they didn't support the MP3 or JPEG options, but those are of marginal importance for most people.) My advice: Get a reputable brand."
1,Piece of crap...,"It looks great - and is loaded with features.. unfortunately it turns out to be the ""disposable"" type. HAve had problems since the first day - not playing some DVDs and then finally after less than 60 days, it just would not recognize anything I pop in it. Save money on the long run - buy something decent ONCE instead of buying cheap every month."
4,Shoulder Pulley,Product received promptly and in good condition. This was purchased for my mother who is recuperating from a broken shoulder. The only thing I didn't like is that there is no way to change the resistance (there is none).
2,Apex Digital should be sued,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
1,"Mine only lasted 7 months, they won't honor warranty!","Apex may be an inexpensive alternative for those of us on a small budget, but mine broke within 7 months and they won't honor the one year warranty. They said it would cost 215 dollars plus shipping and handling to repair a manufacturers default( the plastic just fell apart). Considering I only paid 100 dollars, I told them they were crazy. Then when I asked to speak to a supervisor they hung up on me. I guess it was great while it lasted."
4,Seems pretty good so far,"I got this Apex PD500 for ""free"" for buying some Lane furniture. It is my first portable, and so far it seems OK. Constructed a little cheaply, but it does work fine with a decent picture and OK sound (have not tried with headset yet). Controls are so easy my 5-year old son figured them out quickly and prefers to watch Scooby-do on this portable instead of regular TV! If it holds up, it will be great for use in our camper this summer."
1,NOT THE TRUE ALBUM!!!,"I have the actual album and this isn't it (Why one star because it's deceiving putting the LP's cover on it as if it were the actual Vinyl Re-Mastered). All this company did is round up songs already remastered and put them on one disc! ""Who's Getting It Now"" Is the version that's disco'd out and over done, not the actual LP's version; Such A Shame! I guess I'll be content with Vinyl put on CD that I done myself! PS. I'll Make Sure The Actual Version Is Available On The Tube Of You!!!"
2,Uh...it's barely O.K.,"Well, there is nothing else out there in which a teacher can use on the Enlightenment, so I guess this will have to do! Don't expect an engrossing, History Channel like video. It is mostly college professors discussing the various philosophes. It's O.K. to use for 20-30 minutes, but no more!"
4,Sonja Henie musical charmer!,"Forget Scarlett O'Hara! The big question in Hollywood is who'll play Violet Jansen in ""Girl of the North"". Studio press agent Jimmy Sutton (Tyrone Power) stumbles across the slim resumé belonging to Trudi Hovland (Sonja Henie), a Minnesota schoolteacher with absolutely no experience in acting. Despite her protests, Trudi and her wisecracking auntie (Edna May Oliver) are packed off to Hollywood. You can pretty much guess the rest...Despite a second-rate Irving Berlin score (""The Song of the Metronome"", ""I'm Sorry for Myself"", ""I Poured My Heart into a Song""), SECOND FIDDLE comes alive mainly thanks to the chemistry of Henie and Power--who indeed were romantically involved for a short while during production of the movie.SECOND FIDDLE is available (along with the other big Sonja Henie favourite SUN VALLEY SERENADE) on DVD in the United Kingdom. Currently, the only Henie film available in the domestic United States is her second-to-last one, IT'S A PLEASURE."
3,"Weak Irving Berlin score, but fine cast and production","If you're looking for typical Irving Berlin song hits, skip this one (""The Song of the Metronome"" is one of the deathless ditties here). But if you're in the mood for an agreeable musical show, there are engaging vocals by Mary Healy and The King Sisters, and Sonja Henie's skating is impressive. The plot parodies Hollywood's ""search for Scarlett O'Hara,"" with schoolteacher Henie brought to the movie capital by press agent Tyrone Power. Good supporting cast, especially Edna May Oliver as Henie's maiden aunt. The picture and sound quality are excellent."
5,"you need this book, but ignore the grammar","This book gives great advice for anyone who is married or thinking of getting married. Yes, some of the advice is common sense, but from what I see of the epidemic of divorce, not many people have common sense! If you do not understand these concepts, you will not have a good marriage.One annoying thing about the book, though, is that there was apparently very little editing done. Of course, this is common in books these days. No one knows, or cares, how to proof or edit. ""when I compare Nan and I to just about every couple I know"". Ever hear of subject and object? This usage is throughout the book. At one point, there is a reference to a ""crumbled"" grocery list. Hey, cookies crumble, paper crumples. To anyone who has a degree of basic literacy, these things are a constant annoyance."
2,If You're Not A Yuppie...,"This book was recommended to me for the ""clear vision"" of what a marriage is to mean...well, perhaps for a yuppie or anyone of the ""Boomer"" generation. I'm in my early 30's and felt that the author said my generation gave up too easy AND are determined to work harder at our marriages. Beyond those two generalizations, it was ""look how it is for us/our generation.""I tend to agree with the reviewer who stated this was an extended ""glossy magazine article"" of a book (for more information, read the review ""Piercing Glimpse into the Obvious"").I regret spending the money on this book. About 95% of this book is just plain common-sense...save your money."
2,Too Conservative,"I agree with much of the book's message; specifically, no marriage is perfect and you must look at it as a life long commitment during the good and bad times. The problem is, the author seems to be in a pretty bad marriage which makes the book very depressing, when I don't think it needs to be. If you are not dealing with an affair, a spouse who is walking out in anger, or thinking of a divorce, I would suggest a different book."
3,Better Ones Out There,"Her main point is good, but a lot of her 'example' stories didn't support it.She's pretty liberal, and it comes through in her writing - which is fine, but I'm thinking that it's a politically neutral topic.It's ok."
4,"informative, honest and distressing","The book was an easy read which touched on many marital issues that we all seem to overlook. It deeply explores the ugly, honest side of marriage while also exploring the beautiful side of commitment, forgiveness love and marriage. The book is full of real, honest stories from married and divorced people. A very good read for anyone struggling with thier marriage and/or contemplating divorce. The only down side was, in the kindle version I bought, the amount of typos and clerical errors was extensive. But if you can get past that, the material in the book is well worth reading."
3,Cheater or cheating - this one is for you!,"The bulk of this book is devoted to the subject of cheating on your spouse, contemplating an affair or leaving your marriage to be with a lover. So if you are thinking of two-timing your partner or divorcing to be with someone else, this book may help you avoid making either of these very bad decisions. But if you are merely struggling with the fact that your husband or wife is driving you crazy and want to find out how to improve marital relations, you may want to search elsewhere. There are several situations noted in the book that most married persons can relate to and it is good to hear that other couples have the same issues, but I wasn't satisfied with the overall content and focus of the book."
4,Still reading...,"I'm still in the process of reading this book. I'm little over 3/4 of the way through and keep thinking I'm going to find something inspiring here. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book but it really applies to the couples who have been married 8+ years without stepchildren. Yeah, that's a whole other set of baggage. This is my first marriage but my husbands second and he has two children (and a Bi-polar ex-wife) from that marriage. What is talked about in this book is indeed mostly common sense but what I have always thought was common sense isn't so common. Iris is good at pointing out that none of us are perfect and we need to pick our battles. What's really worth a fight to you? Piles of clothes and the cap being left of the toothpaste just aren't what people should divorce over. I also like that she compares starting a family to creating a new civilization of your own. She really does touch on some important bases in marriage but certainly not all the possible bases."
4,An Excellent Biography.,I really enjoyed reading this book. Full of great information and well-written. I walked away from this reading experience with a much greater feel for and knowledge of Russia and its leader during the Stalin era. I highly recommend it. I was never bored.
4,Stalin .. the books,"Still reading and am fascinated by what both books reveal about him, his associates and family, and the times. Peter"
3,Abridged Audio Book Version.,"Not criticizing the book, but the abridged audiobook edition. So much is abridged out I really haven't learned much I didn't know, and I'm nothing close to an expert in 20th century Russian history. The unabridged 800+ page version I imagine is a much more satisfying read to digest."
1,No illustrations with Kindle edition!,I cannot fault the book but the Kindle version has no illustrations. Illustrations are a very significant part of the book's contents and their lack is outrageous. Kindle readers can do illustrations justice so there is no excuse for the incompleteness. Reducing the amount of data benefits me not at all.The price is a premium for a Kindle book and what is delivered should be premium as well. Were the illustrations included this review would be 5 star.
1,Childishly bad,"HAving read the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book over the summer holiday. What a disappointment! Rarely have I read such a badly-written book, either fiction or non-fiction. Many of the sentences are over-wrought, much of it is repetitive and large parts of it are unintelligable the grammer is so bad. There really seems to be litte to it as a biography either. The attempts at understadning Stalin's personality are naive and silly and often contradictory. The historical thread is confused and confusing and in the end the story becomes dull. Not worth the money or the time required to read it."
1,bad prose,"Although the author had done extensive and ground breakinf research, the problem is that he cannot write. His prose reads like a bad first draft. Didn't the publisher have a competent editor to work on this book?"
1,Factual Errors in Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar,"I will not go into any details in this first review, but one very important oversight by the editors was the overlooking of the errors in factual information such as dates, names, etc. If a teacher were to use this book in a history class the students would be subject to a wealth of misinformation."
4,Depressing,"Soviet history is already depressing, when you throw into the mix a biography of the 20th century's most brutal and bloody dictator, the story becomes downright morbid. This book is highly recommended."
4,The best biography on Stalin I have read,"I have read a few books on Stalin and if you are looking for a biography of Stalin, this book is the best I have come across. I found some new information although nothing really dramatical.My major criticism on the book, is that Stalin was a man who was concerned more with staying in power then the family lives of the people close to him. As such I feel that much of the book emphasis on the history on the people around Stalin is overdone."
2,interesting but needs rewriting,"I'm halfway through this book, and think it should have been edited/proofread..radically. The author has gathered much information on Stalin's life and the Terror in the Soviet Union, but he is prone to indefinite references which force one to read and reread some sentences to understand them. The narrative is disconnected at times, and sometimes it's impossible to be sure who is doing what to whom. If one knows something about Soviet history the book provides some lurid details, and confirmation (as if anyone needed it) that Stalin was an unparalleled villain surrounded by thugs. Perhaps its greatest value is in showing what might happen if the Islamo-fascists succeed in Europe: they have the same modus operandi as the Bolsheviks, who used mass slaughter as a societal panacea."
3,Not for novices,"Yowzahs! If you want a DETAILED biography of Stalin's political life then pick this up. I fully recommend it to grad and doctoral students or anyone else writing a book.If you are a little curious and your last Russian history class was in high school, then you might want to look elsewhere.I was overwhelmed. When I got out of bed, wanting to draw my own character profiles and story arcs, I decided that this would NOT be a good bed time read.Thorough, scholarly and well-written this book made me feel stupid."
2,Some Sections of the Book Better Than Others,"I can understand the need to document the minutiae of Stalin's life and the terror he unleashed upon the Russian people, but Montefiore seemed to have a maddening need to examine it at nearly the sub-atomic level! Historians often don't realize that we the readers don't find the author's level of examination as interesting as they do. Praise to the author for his effort, but I think the thesis of Stalin being a madman was assumed before going in, so the metric ton of evidence presented was useful but unnecessary."
1,Rambling & disconnected,"With this book, Montefiore proves he can navigate the Soviet archives. Unfortunately, he also proves that he can't connect two thoughts, write a coherent paragraph, or develop a theme. It seems that he has collected a mountain of quotations, which he can throw at any given historical event. The book reads as if it had been written by a rookie newspaper reporter. Montefiore can travel, in 1 sentence, through disparate unattributed quotes, through apparently irrelevant footnotes, and through myriad points in time. This is not history. It is not even journalism. Don't waste your time or your money on this hugely disappointing collection of words."
5,one of the best of the best,the realness of new york the gritty black and white the storylines without things blowing up or people running around aimlesslyl looking for someone to kill this is a real treat especailly for native new yorkers who can recongnize landmarks buildings etc of a new york long gone. the charactors are real people not reved up testerone super slick cops and robbers but real stories about real situations
5,I can&#65533;t believe how fast my daughter learned to read,"Mrs. Sanseri has done teachers (especially those of us who homeschool) a great favor by making phonics instruction in the Spaulding method accessable to everyone. My daughter started this program at 5 years old, and within months she was reading at a second grade level! Her penmanship is also very pretty, and she looked forward to new spelling words every week. We also tried ""Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons"" and found it was too simple for my 5-year-old, but perfect for my 3 year old who wasn't ready to hold a pencil yet. Buy both books (especially if you have more than one child) and determine what kind of instruction your child best responds to."
3,"A good supplement to WRTR, but lacks organization","The step by step lessons are very useful and will be of great help to anyone trying to implement WRTR at home. However, some of the material is not as organized as it could be, which makes some of the lessons a bit difficult to follow. There is certainly room for improvement in future editions. Nevertheless, this book is a good investment."
4,"Helpful for WRTR but, still a little tough to follow...",Material lacks the organization it could have. The Spelling to Read and Write & the W.I.S.E. Guide to Spelling by this author is a replacement for Teaching Reading & a wiser investment.
5,Part of a Great One-Two Punch,"I finished ""Programming and Customizing PICmicro Microcontrollers"" and I thought it was the best technical book I have ever read. Now that I have worked through the book and started to design my own PICmicro circuits, I wanted to find something that had all the information I needed.I ordered this book with some trepedation because I was nervous that it would be the big PICmicro book simply reformatted. I should have trusted Myke more; the book has very little overlap to the big PICmicro book and complements it very well and is perfect for somebody designing circuits.Combined with the big PICmicro book, you will have everything you need to work with the Microchip PICmicro!"
4,Nice Program!,"The handwriting recognition software isn't that great, though it adds other features such as a dictionary and word complete. All in all, a good program, even if you do not use the handwriting recognition software."
4,Great video but...,"I bought this video as a gift for my husband. He was thrilled when he opened the package and wanted to watch it right away. I put it into our DVD player and got an error message saying the playback feature may not be available on this disc. Thinking there was some kind of problem with the disc I immediately contacted Amazon and requested a replacement. The exchange went fine, no problems there. The new disc arrived today but unfortunately the same error message appears when trying to run it on our DVD player. I tried putting the disc in my PC and it runs fine there thank goodness. Unfortunately my husband prefers to view videos on the TV as the picture is larger and easier for him to see. We will keep the disc but wish there was no problem playing it through the DVD player."
4,Amazing,"This film covers all the great battles in the world since the First World war. The data presented is amazing and the images and interviews, stupendous."
1,Different region?,"Received the item quickly and couldn't beat the price but, it will not play on our DVD player. Goes through the motions and then the ""different region"" pops up. Received from a dealer in Great Britain. Did not realize there was a difference. Will have to return. Review given was for ""You Can't take it with you"" - sorry, my mistake."
5,Pass Your Copy Around,"Buy Lipshtick, read it (it'll take all of two days), write your name in the front cover and pass it through your circle of friends and hope that it eventually makes it back to you. Even if it doesn't make it back to your shelf, you will know that you've shared something really great. Pretty much any woman will find something to sympathize with and something to laugh at on every page. It's too bad the male ""reader from NY, NY"" didn't get it. I'd be interested to hear other men's responses."
5,Buy it for all your girlfriends...,Laugh out loud funny! Gotta get this for all your girlfriends...and make em read it to the guys! Can't say enough about it. I loved it!
4,"No holds barred, chin hair and all girl talk!","What a fun book! The perfect account of what it's like to grow up ""Girl"". From the heartache of school girl crushes and embarrassing dating disasters to the slap-in-the-face reality of marriage and the REAL truth about pregnancy and motherhood ~ Gwen covers it all. And she doesn't mince words either ~ I couldn't believe some of the things this woman put in print! Every woman will be able to find something in these pages to relate to ~ even if she'd never admit to anyone but her closest girlfriends. Get this book, then get copies for all the women you know!"
5,I love this book!,"A wonderful, therapeutic book. It made me laugh and cry and nod in agreement. It is so much more pleasureable to read than books like Promiscuity. So much more hopeful! I speak as a member of the generation that raised people Gwen's age and have always considered this group interesting. They are my generation's kids! I have learned a lot about this group from this book. From a ""cool"" mother!"
1,Skil saw warped base plate,"My new Skil SHD77M arrived. I heard that there was a problem of the base plate not being flat, but assumed Skil had fixed that. Mine is way out of flat! The whole saw rocks as you place it on the work piece. So, back she goes. What a pain."
4,A great saw that has gotten better!,"I have owned one of these saws for close to twenty years and only needed a new one because I had over $6,000.00 worth of tools stolen. I got this new saw to replace the stolen one and intended to by a Sky Hook to put on it but to my surprise the new model comes with a Sky Hook. The 51 degree capability is also a nice extra. Provided you regularly check and/or top off the hypoid oil, this will be the last saw you ever buy and is far better and safer than any of those cheap direct drive saws."
4,Nice Saw,"This is a really good saw, it tracks very well. The only fault I find with this saw is that the bevel scale is hard to adjust. Mine is verry stiff. The reduce weight is great so they won't be that much fatigue if you have to use it all day."
1,skil saw SHD77M problems,Doesn't cut square! Second Skil product this year that sucks! When I called on the first one they told me it wasn't really a Skil product... they just lease the name from Skil but then Skil doesn't stand behind it. I don't know if this will be the case with the saw... but avoid it!
4,9111g,Very nice saw that I enjoy using. It did not have the degree of torque on the wrist that was expected based on other evaluators. Also the weight is very manageable. I am pleased with the purchase.
2,Not like they used to be,"I've used Skil saws professionally for most of my life. My last one, the SHD77M stopped working a little over a year after I got it. The aramature was fried turning this saw into a piece of scrap. The saw had not been abused or pushed beyond its capacity. If anything, it was used gently. They don't make them like they used to. I'm going to try Dewalt this time."
3,Just OK,"This is perhaps one of History Channel's better biographies, although it lacks much detail. For example, Sitting Bull was with Buffalo Bill's Wild West for a season, and that receives scant mention. It was actually an eventful time in his life. Still, they had only 50 minutes.At the very least this may pique the viewer's interest in Sitting Bull, one of the more remarkable figures in American history. I was annoyed by the narrator speaking of the U.S. Calvary. Is it too fussy of me to ask that the term be properly pronounced? Calvary is where Jesus was crucified. Cavalry refers to men on horseback--which the 7th Cavalry was. When I hear that sort of error in a scholarly piece, I start wondering about the accuracy of everything else."
5,Sitting Bull Rules!!,"Disregard that last review,Sitting Bull Rules in this A&E Biography.It's a must see!!"
1,loosefit? right..,i have adidas in a plenty - this is the smallest medium sized shirt i ever had the discomfort of putting on.worse yet is the poor service i got from fansedge!never again!!!
5,My favorite stevia,"To begin with -- I love stevia! It's helped me get completely off of sugar. This stuff is totally natural, the Japanese have been using it for centuries; I don't understand why the FDA discourages promotion of it as a sweetener, because it's super-sweet (perhaps because companies producing poisons like aspartame would suffer huge losses).This is a particularly good brand, and since it's unflavored you can use it in anything -- especially good with yogurt or any kind of liquid. Not as good for baking though; for that try agave nectar. This brand has a higher concentration of stevia and does not use alcohol for filler like some other brands."
1,New Bottle With Black Mold!!!!,"My brand new bottle of Clear Stevia was opening this morning to goopy black mold all over the dropper!!!! I can't believe a brand new bottle can be all moldy inside. The bottle expiration is 05/2013. How can this happen? I would like to get a replacement, but I kept this in the refrigerator until today when I opened it and it is past the return date. I'll never shop this merchant again! I'd like to add a photo but looks like I can't do that."
2,Not Exactly Happy,"Well, I don't really like to say negative things about products, but this one was not what I had expected. It was the first time I tried Stevia, and if I had not gone on to try other brands of Stevia, this product would have stopped me from ever using Stevia.It did not sweeten very well, and did not taste good in hot drinks. When I heard about Stevia they said, ""It was sweeter than Sugar"". However, not this product.I was not expecting sweeter than sugar, but I was expecting it to sweeten my drinks. It did not. I would not recommend this product.Disapointed"
3,Is it the same?,The packaging is different than what is shown in picture. So the question- is it the same product? And it cost 75% more than the last purchase.
5,"I found ""Adobe PhotoShop for Textile Design,"" by Frederick Chipkin informative and well written.","I found ""Adobe PhotoShop for Textile Design,"" by Frederick Chipkin informative and well written. After 20 years experience as an designer and stylist, I discovered new and innovative design techniques. I was particularly impressed by Mr. Chipkin's approach to simplifying complex tasks. The book is laid out clearly and concisely, making complex tasks logical to execute and easy to master. There is a wealth of information and techniques that allow the artist to become highly proficient in design creation and processing. The book is a versatile tool; providing the expertise for both the student and the instructor. I have sampled a number of similar books over the years, and I say that I find Mr. Chipkin's book probably the best in the field. I strongly recommend Mr. Chipkin's book to textile design professional, as well as those just entering the field."
3,Missing pieces,"Arrived car kit Sony Ericsson Bluetooth p 00, but minus the power supply cable and so I cannot run the device, hoping to send it to me as soon as"
3,"*should* be compatible with ""normal"" TV's","First let me say that I do not own, nor have I ever seen this unit in person. In response to the ""cheap is not always good"" review, though, the comment that ""this system is not compatablie with most tv's"" is very likely to be inaccurate. As long as your TV has a composite/RCA or S-video input (most do - these are the same connectors used by non-progressive-scan DVD players), there should be no compatibility problems. Most DVD players these days boast ""Progressive-Scan"" output. This does _not_ pose a problem for older, non-progressive-scan TV's. To gain the benefits of the progressive-scan output of the DVD player, however, you need a progressive-scan capable TV. But, all ""progressive-scan"" DVD players can also be connected to non-progressive-scan TV's without any problems."
1,Shareware,I found a lot of shareware on this product. Save your money. There was an old version of Endora.So sad.
5,All your favorite oldies on one disc!,"Those fans of S.O.Z. that were fed up trying to hunt down the ultra rare Discography 10"", fret no more. This is the CD version, and I was just as shocked to find it! All of the 7"" and rare tracks are on here, including my favorite, ""Theme for Bastard Children."" buy it! You want this!"
5,better than any Gypsy Kings albums,"Tight, excellent production of modern gypsy influenced music. If you like the Gypsy Kings, you'll love this album."
5,Very handy little tool!,"I bought this a month ago looked and thought nice but I will never use it...WRONG! Lots of torque and the right angle drive gets you into really tight spots. Did a job on a machine that I had done the same repair a year ago, cut the time in half. This isn't an electric screwdriver, although it could be, it's a socket wrench. Gtreat item the person who said it wasn't strong is NUT's. BUY IT!"
1,Over rated torque output,Skil 2372-01 7.2-Volt Li-Ion Power WrenchThis wrench was disappointing in the output torque cabability. It did not develop anywhere close the the specified torque. It simply stalls when it needs to develop maximum torque. This product can only be used to spin loose fasteners and should not be expected to break a fasterner loose or tighten a fastener.
1,Junk,This item is a piece of junk. It will only last about 6 month. This is the last Skil tool I will ever buy.................
2,Skil cordless rachet,"okay for a short while, then switch started working only intermittantly. About the 7th or 8th time I used it...it wouldn't turn on at all...threw it in the garbage."
5,Favorite little tool,"I purchased this wrench for my husband. He was sulking because his favorite little wrench no longer worked. He used it a lot, especially to manuever in small spaces. He had a project coming up where he wished he had his little wrench to make the job easier and professional. He does AC repair and he is a stickler for perfection, because he says his customers deserve to get quality work for the money they spend. He was a happy camper when the package arrived. It's amazing how tools make a man happy. I had never ordered anything from Amazon so I was not sure if this would be the same quality wrench as he previously had. However, I thought what the heck, it was worth taking a chance based on the price. I was pleased with the process and the merchandise. I was sent an email informing me of the status of my order. I do plan to utilize the service again for future needs. Have a great day everybody."
4,3 Times a Charm??,Skil 2372-01 7.2-Volt Li-Ion Power WrenchGREAT Product BUT I am on my 3rd one now in less than 2 years. 1st one broke wile tightening a bolt. 2nd one stopped holding a charge (bad battery) after about 6 months of very limited use... but I always kept it in the charging dock. Now I am on my 3rd one and the reason why I keep it in my arsenal is because they really are a great idea and work great (if not broken or dead) lol.
4,Handy but not very powerful.,"I work as a mechanic and needed something to work on interior components. Something compact and convenient. This thing works very well for removing and installing bolts,nuts,and screws in compact areas. It does not have any power and is a bit noisy. But if you need something light weight it works great but don't expect to tighten or break anything with it."
2,Disappointed because the bit size is small,"The wrench has a 1/4"" square bit head which only fits small sockets. It does not come with an adapter to step-up to the normal square bit heads for socket wrenches. (It does come with a few socket and screw bits that fit the 1/4"" bit). I learned the hard way when I took it out for a Sunday project and it didn't fit my sockets. I will try to find at the hardware store a step-up converter but it should have come with one."
2,Poor battery,I have the same problem as some other users. I only have used this tool a few times and now the charger shows a full charge but the tool is completely dead. Another battery is only available with a new bottom half from the head down for $60.
1,"Great Idea,Very Bad QualityTool","This is my second replacement SKILL 2372-01 7.2-Volt Lithium-Ion Power Wrench. This tool lasted for 3 or 4 uses over the coarse of a year, then stopped charging, and is now dead. I contacted Skill, and they want to charge me $35 to service the tool.I have many rechargeable power tools, and after hundreds of uses and years of use they need to be replaced. This SKILL 2372-01 7.2-Volt Lithium-Ion Power Wrench lasted about 6 times then died.This tool is way below standards, and should be avoided. This tool is low quality junk made in China. Skill should replace these tools free of charge because of the failure rate. Look at the reviews for this skill tool, and you will understand why this tool should be avoided.I will be bypassing all Skill tools from now on when it comes to rechargeable tools. There are far better choices out there from companies that will stand behind their products."
1,A brief happy time then dead.,"This thing worked so good...for like a month. Then it died completely, and I can't recommend that."
5,Best bang for the buck,"I actually got this electric ratchet through a mail-in rebate when I bought a set of wiper blades. I'm a full-time Jeep/Nissan technician, so with a $35 ratchet, I figured it would break in a month or so, but what the heck, it was free. This ratchet was probably one of my most used tools because it was compact to fit anywhere, didn't have a heavy battery attached to it and made jobs much faster. I beat this ratchet down 6 days a week for 3 years before the motor on it finally burned out. For an item that cost $35.00 new and it lasted 3 years of constant use and abuse, I would say that this is probably the electric ratchet that you can buy, hands down. Also, it's much stronger than I thought it would be; only being 10 ft. lbs. weaker than my air-powered version. I would recommend this to anyone for any kind of use, and I won't even consider buying anything else."
2,Handy tool for a little while!,"My son gave me one of these for Christmas several years ago. I've used it very little, maybe a 2 or 3 hours total. The last time I used it the battery went dead and I forgot to put it back on charge. Now it will not take a charge. I took it apart and have the battery in hand but so far I have found no replacement. It was a handy tool to have but I will not be buying another Skil. I use a wide variety of battery tools at work, never seen one that you can't replace the battery!"
2,"Good information, but dry.","I purchased this video for use in my Grade 9 Social Studies class. It had everything I needed in terms of the content, but the production value was bare-bone minimal. It sort of looks like a high school av club made it for their final project, though they would have received an A+ for their efforts. However, my 14 year-old students failed to see the value in a video that didn't contain the flash that they had become accustomed to.I would recommend this video for a Grade 12 class or an introductory university history course, as younger children simply did not appreciate it."
1,Yuck!,Terrible! One of the worst films on an important topic I have seen. Absolutely unusable in a classroom.
3,regoinal map,"I was really hoping for a good detailed map of the Guyana's, especially of Suriname- but found very little detail here. I guess I will have to buy a map locally."
3,"good product, horrible shipping","Arrived 3 days after expected delivery date. I know, I know, not Amazons fault, but I can't install the stereo (which arrived 1 day early) until I get the harness. Just irritating, thats all! The wiring harnesses are excellent, I always use this brand."
4,Unrepentent Manson speaks out,"Charles Manson speaks of his life and crimes; cocky, sneering, and unrepentent to the end. Profiled is his troubled childhood, his early prison days, his ""Haight Ashbury"" period, and the murders. Also included are recollections from a childhood neighbor and parole officer, as well as matronly-looking Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, Leslie Van Houten, and Pat Krenwinkel. Highlights include Manson's confrontations with the parole board; even he realizes that that's a lost cause. A good show with a lot of insight into Charlie's madness."
3,Not the version expected,"I spent too much time looking into the manufacturer's website to see that this is not the same product as listed. It had an entirely different connection than expected, but that was my fault for not looking at this dealer's information."
2,Not happy,I got a great price on this item. Nice design but it broke about a week after I started using it. I think something went wrong with the bulb and bulb replacements cost just as much as a new unit.
2,Beautiful Pictures but Questionable Incomplete Recipies,"The authors approach to many traditional recipies are extremely oversimplified and lack authentic ingredients and techniques that are crucial to the many subtle characters of nearly all Indian dishes. This book might be a nice ""eye-candy"" gift for a friend who collects cookbooks, but I would not recommend this to anyone who wanted an authentic Chicken Makhani or Saag dish or who wants to replicate their favorite Indian Restaurant's cuisine. These recipies wont even come close. Although, this book has received many outstanding reviews, I believe that it is not worthy of such praise."
3,Somethings Missing...North Carolina,"I love Kimberly White and Sweet Tomorrows was excellent. Yet, Hard to Love left me very frustrated. Alexandria's secret pushes the envelope and it seems to be more to fill pages than perpetuate plot. In addition, Sea's response to the truth was not one that coincides with a man in love. He places his business above his love, it demeaned the entire relationship. The love scenes were steamy but just not in the romantic vein. The characters described their coupling as satisfying their lust. Furthermore, it was nice to see Tayla and Meridian but they were soooooooooo sappy. They lacked depth. I was disappointed. It just had a different feel, not Ms. White's normal fair. I did compare it to Sweet Tomorrows and that colored the reading experience."
5,Smashing Highlights!,"This is a great tape, I own many Boxing highlight tapes and this is one of the best. It includes the full 8 min war between Hagler and Hearns. All of the fights are covered and none of the fights (except Leonard-Duran II) are really neglected."
5,Great Retrospective of Four Stars,"Great Narration in which the rivalry of the ""Fab Four"", Duran, Hagler, Hearns, and Leonard is relived. This tape shows the great fights between the ""Fab Four"" and I'll guarantee that you will you be caught in the drama of this exciting tape. An absolute must for boxing fans."
1,Bad experience,"I am very dissapointed by the product and the execrable customer service the Funai Company provided. The unit I purchased malfunctioned while still under warranty, I went to a repair shop, they tried to fix it by replacing parts, it did not work, and finally Sylvania, Funai agrreed to replace the unit with another one. This process took a month. To finalize the paper work or whatever two other months passed. And I still do not have the replacement dvd after three months!!!"
1,Quit Working for No Reason,"When I woke up this morning, I found no indicator lights for power to this unit. I thought it got unplugged. It is plugged in and it is DEAD. I have many other items plugged into the same outlet including a tv and everything else is working. Maybe it has a blown fuse inside or something??? If anyone else has had this problem, please let me know how it was corrected!! ThanksMike Jones,,,,mikiej2@cox.net"
1,You get what you pay for,This is the most horrible piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned. It has eaten countless tapes. I've owned it since January and have already taken it to be repaired twice. It will have to go back to the repair shop a third time because the problem persists. Do not buy this unit. It's a piece of crap.
1,VCR/DVD destroys my tapes,"I wish I had read the other reviews for this machine before purchasing it; it has eaten three of my tapes, as it apparently has many other people's VCR tapes. (I did not buy this from Amazon). I highly recommend that if you are considering buying a VCR/DVD combo, that you NOT buy this model, apparently in this case you get what you pay for...."
2,Beware of cheap electronic devices like this,"Most people say they have problems with the dvd playback on thisdevice, but we had just the opposite problem. Our dvds play great, but the vhs player is just terrible. Half of the tapes play like they were bootlegged or something. None of our other vhs players do this; perhaps it's because this isn't built as strongly as a normal vhs player. We have way too many good films on videocassete to just ignore them, or throw away, because this vhs/dvd player can't play them back correctly. Even after taping some shows using the vhs player, the bloody thing still can't play the tape back correctly--it even jumps up and down and the color fades. In conclusion, I'd just like to say if you're considering buying this product, I--and my whole family--would advise you to think twice."
1,Unit eats VHS tapes even after two authorized repairs,"Bought the unit January 26, 2004. Units started eating VHS tapes during recording and playback in July 2004. Took unit to local authorized Sylvania service center twice. Both times upon return, it continues to eat VHS tapes during recording and playback. $100 unit cost $65 in labor that hasn't repaired the unit yet. Am fighting Sylvania Customer Support currently to acquire a replacement unit for this defective unit. Will not purchase Sylvania in the future. Zero stars."
1,VCR STOPPED WORKING,"the vcr jams up all the time now and won't play tapes anymore, definitley waste of money"
1,waste of money,This machine is not worth what I paid for it. It doesn't recognise some of my disks which I was told it would and so is useless to me for that was the reason I purchased it.
1,I am SO disappointed,I got this for my 3 year old for Christmas mainly because I was tired of hearing all of his Disney vidoes a million times a day. Things went great for 3 months. Then the stupid thing ate Dumbo. Image a little 3 year old crying because 1. Dumbo (his favorite because we sing the songs together) is now all gone and 2. he can't watch ANY of his tapes in his room now. I really wish that I read the other reviews before getting excited about this purchase and disappointing my son. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT! I would've been better off acting out the videos myself.
1,VCR chews my tapes,"we have now owned this player for approx 98 days. We rarely used it for playing vcrs, and tried two in there yesterday, It chewed and destroyed both of them. Called Sylvania who were quite rude, and they said as we had owned it longer than 90 days, labor and parts were no longer guaranteed. I tried to point out that even though we ordered online via Amazon prior to Christmas, we didn't recieve the thing until the 24th and then didn't set it up immediately. They said it doesn't make a difference, we are the owners since the order date, even if it was on a UPS truck. So now we are stuck with a half functioning set. Learn from my lesson, pay up and get something with a better guarantee. 90 days from date of order is just unacceptable."
1,Piece of junk,"This machine is a piece of junk! I will never purchase another Sylvania product again. We had the combo player for less than 6 months when the vcr stopped taping and started eating tapes. When I called the company they told me that the parts were covered, but not labor. It will cost $100 to repair the machine, and the repairman basically said that he sees a lot of them by this company."
2,Reviews I read before were great but I differ,"I purchased this unit in January 2004 after reading about 10 reviews on this website. All the reviews were stellar. I am not happy with the VCR feature of this unit. It is very noisy. Even when not playing and the unit is powered up. It tapes terribly. The only good thing is the sound other than the noise. The DVD feature is fine. I guess if you are not that particular about the VCR this would be a good choice. However, I want a better VCR."
1,The DVD stopped working after less than 100 hours of use,The 90 day warranty is useless... I don't know why Sylvania resells this junk.
3,dvd vcr,bought used it couldn't figure it out the price was right i recommend this to people who want to burn dvds and vcrs
2,There's better to be had at this price-point...,"I've had two of these units for three years now - both in fine working order, although I practically never used their VHS features. They're light, easy to work with, and the remote control is easy to figure and hold.There is no DTS-mode for these.At the time of this writing, I'm sure that spending $100.00 on a DVD unit nets you better options..."
1,Completely and utterly disappointed...,"I received this DVD/VCR combo for Christmas last year, and I'm totally dissatisfied with it. The user interface is deplorarble, and the remote can actually get out of sync with the main unit! And now, the VCR record quality is degrading rapidly. The Super Bowl is snowy and cuts out on a new tape!"
3,Ok for the price.,"The good:Cheap. Lots of inputs & outputs. Good looks. Dolphin Screensaver.The bad: confusing remote. Hard to program.This is decent for the price I paid. Mine stopped loading disks properly after 3 years of heavy use and a move and is now on its way to the electronics recycler. I think I only paid like $50 for it way back when, so this is neither surprising nor really disappointing either."
5,Well worth it!,"Definately a good buy if you're looking for an easy to use, inexpensive unit. Its nice having both the dvd and vhs player in the same deck, its convenient and saves space. I previously owned a more expensive panasonic unit and the picture quality in this dual deck is actually better. Not too expensive, all the features i was looking for. Good buy."
3,Not what I expected,"I already had the game ""Hunting Unlimited 2009"" and love it. I wanted more hunting games and this Hunting Unlimited 3 was highly rated. From the reviews I read, they must not of gotten the 2009 game yet. I guess this Unlimited 3 would be a good game if I hadn't already had a newer version of it. The animals and scenery is not as real looking as the 2009 and just isn't as much fun. If you want a more realistic game, don't buy this one, buy the Hunting Unlimited 2009. Comparing the two games would be like a Black and White TV to a Color TV."
3,Well written Kieslev,"This is the first novel I've read in the Warhammer world, although I'm very familar with the world of Warhammer Fantasy already. What I truely enjoyed about this story was how McNeill wrote the city of Kielev. It's a beautiful, haunting city of Chaos and cold.The story itself of a war hero become Ambassador fighting for his place in the city is decent. There's much I wish had been touched on that was left out. More story including the Tsarina would've been welcome. Although, I did enjoy the overlayed plot of the Butcherman, Kieslev's serial killer haunted by his past.I'm looking forward to reading the follow-up in The Ambassador Chronicles, Ursun's Teeth."
4,THE AMBASSADOR READS LIKE CLASSIC CONAN!,"WOW! What a pleasant surprise of a read. The title sounded dull, but the cover's artwork and synopsis drew me in.Graham McNeill is an awesome writer, who fills this fantasy novel full of action, adventure, and horror. Complete with rich characterizations of both good and evil, The Ambassador storyline drives relentlessly forward with verve and wit. The mixing of genres works beautifully here, and with the choicest words, McNeill takes me on a journey I hated to stop reading.I have already purchased another of this author's work, and can't wait for the continuation sequel to this one. Ursun's Teeth promises to be an awesome thrill ride. And I for one will be there."
1,Choose a different item!!!,"Upon receiving this boombox, I was immediately discouraged when few radio stations were able to come dispite the fact that I can pick them up on my handheld walkman. It was downhill after that - the CD player didn't work and it would turn itself off when switching between tuner and CD. When I could get sound, it sounded hollow and void of any true sound. Choose a different radio, or at least be aware of what you're getting."
1,"Looks sleek, sounds poor!","While this unit has over-all good looks and a price you cant beat. The sound is muffled and indistinct. Spend a little extra money and try a Sony. I went into the store to compare the sound difference and the Sony CFD E95 had superior sound in a similarly sized unit. The Sony was about $... more, but well worth the price difference for the quality of sound!"
3,Beautiful Pitcher,I bought this picture because of the classical look and review discussing how heavy and thick the glass was. I also was looking to find a pitcher that I could use to brew iced tea. Unfortunately this pitcher cannot be used for steeping tea. When I tried to steep the tea I ran the pitcher under hot water from our faucet and then I added water from our kettle. Five seconds after adding the water the pitcher made a cracking sound and the top half slid away from the bottom half into the sink. It was a mess to clean. If this pitcher is to be used for anything other than hot beverages it will work wonderfully. I will continue my search for a glass pitcher capable of steeping tea.
5,yet again a classic,"another astonishing album..............frankly with Ron you are safe to buy any of his albums and you get a record full of classics..............no duff stuff. I am 50+ and been listening to songwriters all my life. I never expected such an eyeopening talent to come so late into my life, I only recently discovered Ron with his 2010 album Long Player, Late Bloomer........... I am amazed by this mans songs and have since bought all of his back catalogue and have listened to nothing else for the last 8 months"
3,okay,"The tests for Kaplan are the only bright point to this book. The information is all there, but it is given very boring and you find it hard to stay awake while reading this. This is the only review book for psych that I did not read because it was dry and boring. So, for tests, this is a nice book, although PR has better one's but for information go to Barron's because the practice questions at the end of each chapter (15 MC) are very good!"
2,Not enough,"From experience, buying a review book for AP exams is very useful. This Kaplan review does not focus enough on many of the key subjects in the AP Psychology. It's too broad and just not enough for you to grasp the information. A review book needs to be to the point but not so broad as this one. I wouldn't recommend it if you need to be explained situations or if you need details"
4,The Angels and Devils of MONEY.,"Perception and mental models about MONEY determine our life-"" successful or not so successful?, satisfying or not sosatisfying?""Money, the most confusing and paradoxical subjectof this modern world - we love it, we also hate it; we strive for it,we also despise it .....Money is human creation and we have createda system of Angels and Devils.Williams Bloom addresses the moneyissue in a holistic way. Readers will understand and feel that""money"" is such an integral part of our life. Hence wecannot have mixed feeling about it but a appropriate perspective inorder that we and the whole of the global village can live a wholesomelife..."
4,"Beautiful, but hardly for play","I was in love with horses as a child (as any girl was!) and I still have a huge soft spot for winged horses. So, when I saw this beautiful butterfly winged lot, I had to have them for my collection. Being Breyer, of course, the horse bodies are magnificent (but keep in mind, as 'toys', not model quality.)I love the whole set.The wings, though, are quite disturbingly fragile. I had one ship with the thin bracket holding one wing in place broken off. And even with careful handling I had the wings on one side (there are two wings on each side) seperate and come unglued. I was unable to fix either problem, and will have to pay for a replacement after only one day!Although extremely beautiful, I would hardly recommend these items for children who would put them through anything but the most careful of play."
4,Anatomy Review,These cards follow the book to a T. They come with several rings that make it easy to break up the stacks into groups to study. I found these to be much easier to work with than the book when studying.
5,Incredible detail - very usefel,"Going back to school, knowing little to nothing about anatomy and physiology, these cards are a God-send. The detail and manner in which one can ""flip"" through these is simply unbelievable. The quality is excellent, as well. These are cards you will have for a lifetime. Literally."
4,Bellydance dvd,I haven't used this yet and am looking forward to using it many times. I got it faster than I thought I would get it thanks
5,Great Work out a so/so Instructional,The other reviews are spot on. This work out will make you sweat. While its not heavy on the instructionm its just enough to give you a taste and you get the feeling that these girls know what they are doing. I look forward to getting more of their DVDs that center around instruction. As a work out this video is great and it gives a taste of what is come if you chose more of their dvds!
1,Belly Flop,"Unfortunately from the very beginning, the DVD started skipping and pausing. I proceeded to give it a chance and continued playing the DVD in hopes that it would smooth out so that I could exercise but that was not the case. Very displeased. And I ended up walking instead."
3,Fun but disappointing,"I bought this video because of the rave videos I read on Amazon.com. So, I was expecting a lot. And I was disappointed. The workout itself was quite fun, the moves were interesting, and I liked the music used. However, I have issues with the voice-over instruction. First of all, the cuing was off and at many times it does not explain many of the moves (i.e. proper form). I'm used to instructors who explain the legwork as well as the arms so you don't have to keep your eyes peeled to the tv screen. Also, the voice-over made me feel like I was watching a performance. Veena and Neena are lovely women, but their smiles seemed to be those of performers, not women who are enjoying a workout. And while I felt like I was working my legs and arms, I didn't really feel like I was getting an cardio workout(and believe me, I put a lot of effort into it). This video is for the easygoing exerciser who wants to have low intensity fun."
4,Nice and fun workout but NOT FOR BEGINNERS,I like this video a lot! It gives you a workout while making you feel sexy at the same time.Half the video is pretty easy but towards the end it get pretty tough but you can get it with practice.One thing I did not like is the music is the SAME thing over and over again. I liked it at first but it gets old after a while.
4,Great aerobic workout.....,"This is a great aerobic workout, and it beautifully incorporates traditional bellydance moves. However, it is not perfect for someone who is looking to simply learn the dance. I liked it because in addition to giving me a great workout, it gave me a chance to isolate certain moves (like traveling steps) and perfect them. The voice-over can be a bit annoying, so when you're familiar with the routine, you may want to try working out without instruction."
5,I Love the Twins!,Get ready to sweat! This workout is hard but lots of fun. The twins break down the moves so well that I can follow along for a pre-coffee morning workout (and that's saying something). I really love the bit at the end where one of the twins dance (or is that just on my vhs copy?).Legs and shoulders really get built up with this workout.
4,Good workout for beginners,"This video will help you learn the basic moves of belly dancing and although it is short workout (about a half hour), you do work up a bit of a sweat and it will help keep your belly toned."
4,NOT a belly dancing lesson - this is an aerobic workout.,"I must say I'm a little shocked at all the carping over this DVD.First off, if you're doing this workout correctly you are going to sweat, and you don't have to be 400 lbs to do it. Yes, you do hop around a lot, and I have D-cup boobs and had no problem with them flopping around more than during jogging or any other aerobic activity, and I just wear a normal support bra. And no, it's not a dance instruction DVD. It's an aerobic workout with some bellydance stylization mixed in. Yes, some of it looks funny, but you don't look exactly gorgeous while you're doing squats either. I noticed an improvement in muscle tone/isolation and stamina after doing this routine for a week.This is a good cardio workout, I think it's a little too short - would prefer at least a full 30 minutes of cardio and this program is 20 minutes with a five-minute warm-up and cool-down. Otherwise I would have given it five stars."
3,NOT for Beginners.,"This video is an excellent workout if you are already a belly dancer. However, if you are just learning belly dancing, there is really no instruction on posture or how to do the various moves. They just jump right in with an intense workout and what I believe are some advanced belly dancing movements. I have taken belly dancing for about 6 months and could not keep up. If you are a beginner or novice, I would pass on this video. If you are an experienced belly dancer, you may really enjoy this aerobic type workout."
3,Not my favorite video,"I was very excited to get this video because I thought it would be so much fun. I was disappointed that neither Neena nor Veena say anything. There is a narrator that tells you what moves to do. This drove me crazy!! The girls are just dancing and smiling. You can turn the narrator off, so after you get the moves down, you can just workout to the music. It was a good workout though."
1,belly dance video review,"I was most displeased with this video as it purported itself as a ""slim down"" video when it's not aerobic at all. Boring, slow and just plain not what your average exerciser is looking for."
3,Please Keep Up,"Overall, it's a good video that keeps your heart rate up. Once I got the hang it I started enjoying it. The instruction can be foggy at times, so it takes a few times to get with it. Veena and Neena don't actually do the instructing, they just do the moves while smiling like plastic Barbie dolls. It can be kind of creepy at times."
4,Pretty good,"I liked the video. I could follow it well. Yes, the camera does do some closeups when you need to see the feet. I thought it was a good low impact exercise routine."
3,Just doesn't inspire me,"This video wasn't terrible. But it wasn't terribly fun or engaging either. Also, the girls have a little bit of a beer gut problem. I can't help but fear that I'll get a similar pouch on my stomach if I follow after these women."
4,Good Work Out,I really enjoy this tape. I thought when I got it that it would be a piece of cake but it's not. These girls will have you sweating and it's fun. It's provided me with a new way of working out.
4,Fun and challenging! a break from regular excercize.,"This video is fun and it challenges you to keep up. Seeing how the two women are so in shape, it encourages you to keep doing better. The foot movements are a little hard to follow, but once you do it a few times, you get the hang of it. I would reccomend this video to anyone who hates to sit on the floor and do 200 crunches and 200 pushups and wait 6 months for a single result, while ruining their back. You also get quick results!"
5,A whole lot of fun!,"This 30-minute video is fun from beginning to end. Before you know it, it's over, and you're sweaty and didn't even feel like you were exercising. It gives a nice cardio workout without being too strenuous, and the girls are pleasant and the tape gets right down to business."
5,I'm hooked!!!,"Just received and completed this workout and I LOVE IT! I also purchased the basic moves but I haven't received it yet. I'm so glad I followed the positive reviews. This is a workout video which incorporates some bellydance moves. I am not a dancer and very much out of shape but I was able to complete the tape without any complication. This is fun, feminine, and it makes you (beginners) sweat. If your looking for a change in your workout routine, this is the video to buy."
4,A Fun Workout! It's helpful to know the moves first.,"This is indeed a fun workout. The only recommendation I would make would be to learn the bellydance moves first from their Discover Bellydance series(Basic moves, Beyond Basic Dance, Mystic Dance). I found it a bit difficult to keep up with them because I didn't know the moves very well...so I went back to the Discover Bellydance videos to learn them. But once you know them, Veena and Neena will put those lessons to work on your body in an upbeat workout! And, yes, I do agree with a previous reviewer...a sports bra is definitely helpful for the well-endowed as you will be shimmying and bouncing quite a bit."
4,Best of the beginners series,"I own all the Neena and Veena tapes. Of the ""Fitness for Beginners"" series, this is my favorite. I out grew the other Beginner tapes, but this one has more staying power. It is a medium level tape. Beginners may think it is tough, while serious workout people will likely be bored. It is fun and the time just flies by while doing it. This is a fitness tape, not a bellydance instruction tape."
5,This book is truly a gem!,"As a young black woman, still in the process of shaping and defining my views about feminism, I found this book completely refreshing. Many of the opinions, thoughts, and views conveyed by Morgan are similar to my own. I was astounded!While I didn't always agree with her point-of-view in the chapter entitled, ""Babymother"" I saw the validity in what she was saying. The only thing missing from this book (which I kept hoping that Morgan would address) was the place of women in Jamaican-American culture and how feminism can be applied in the West Indian community. (esp. since she is a Jamaican woman living in Brooklyn). However, I enjoyed this book overall and would recommend it to any young, black woman."
3,A reread and then some,"I was excited to read this book but when I did, it left me empty. I felt like something was missing but I can't figure what. I did not think any less or any more than before I read it about black women. So I remain unimpressed with the book and with the sorry blurbs on the back from ""black celebrities"" who sounded as if they skimmed the book if even. However, I look forward to reading more of her work and will reread the book because maybe I read it too fast. I champion any black woman sounding her voice!"
4,So That's a Chickenhead,"Being caught at the tail end of the Baby Boom, I'd say that this book is really written from the viewpoint of young women a few years younger than I am. Still, it is reminiscent of Michelle Wallace's ""Black Macho and The Myth of The Superwoman"" which debuted some 20 odd years or so ago. Being a strong willed, independent Black woman is still as hard today as it was 20 years ago and I am glad that there are still fierce sistah's out there willing to address the issues at hand.Great view on a never vanishing topic from a new voice and new perspective !"
3,Biography sheds some light on neglected hero,"This video shows Benedict Arnold was not the monster history has tried to portray him as, detailing his early life as a Connecticut merchant; his daring exploits at Ticonderoga, Valcour Bay, and Saratoga that made him, aside from Washington, America's most brilliant patriot general; and tries to shed some light on the still-murky causes for his treason. Decent recreated history, although the battle reenactments in A&E's ""American Revolution"" are more stirring. Also has a sprinkling of historical inaccuracies, but still informative."
3,Lo Leigh on the Hunt.,"Lo Leigh stars as a renagade fighter, out for blood. On a mission to take out all bad doer's and bring back honor to his country. With the skills of the Buddhist fist, he battles it out with the likes of Carter Wong, and a hand full of other talented fighters in hopes of saving his country. Good story, Good fight sequences, and ofcourse Lo Leigh"
1,This software is crap,Mostly freeware and shareware... DO NOT BUY! Spend the $20 on a real software package and don't waste your money here.
5,Great Sound and Picture,"I have this hooked up to my 32""Pure Flat Sony and it gives great picture and color. Crisp detail, looks similiar to a Phillips DVD I saw at another store. ...P>I love it and it fits into my component rack easily, slim,sharp design."
1,Fact checking should have been done,"If the author chose to write about a variety of people, fact checking should have been done in that in at least one story, facts are plain wrong. This shows a certain laziness on the part of the author. Next time, check with the people you intend to throw mud on."
4,Jung and Wicca?,"One of Vivianne Crowley's better books. If you want a fresh perspective on Wicca from one of the founders of the modern movement this is the book for you. Her Jungian viewpoint is well suited to the Craft, and she breaths life into material that many other authors leave dry, or worse, fanciful. Crowley's work should be in every witches library along with that of Cunningham, Starhawk, and Farrar. Enjoy."
3,Ambivalent,"It is scholarly in its method. However, the conclusions are just that the Bible contains ambiguities and that some ambiguities are more ambiguous than others. Ambiguity may function as a Bible code, but God will tell us when the scrolls will be undone."
2,Boring and not instructive,"I reviewed this video for my 9th grade history class. I wanted an interesting overview of the middle ages. The Professors are so boring, slow, er, um,and grasp for words. Any medieval history professor I have met can discourse eloquently and fluently on the subject, but these three can't. Then they start discussing Charlemagne and his contributions. Well, the kids won't know who Charlemagne was, so this is totally backward! They need to get to the main point! Whoever produced this video is certainly not an educator. Save your money."
4,"It's not Upstairs, Downstairs, but it's pretty good nonetheless","I have to admit that I bought this series ONLY because Stephen Moyer is in it, and as usual, his performance did not disappoint. He is a very gifted and subtle actor, and he shone as Stephen Bannerman. I particularly liked what he did with his character's feelings about serving in World War I.The rest of the cast was also good, in particular, Susan Hampshire, who I had not seen onscreen since The Forstye Saga. I also enjoyed seeing Jane Danson, who I know as Leanne on Coronation Street.All in all, a good viewing experience. This was not a BBC production and it does show a bit in the production values. Overall, however, I am satisfied with my purchase. Fans of British series like Upstairs, Downstairs,will definitely enjoy this."
5,Grand Style,"The Grand is an ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" type series, set in 1920's, and revolves around the owners of ""The Grand Hotel,"" their staff, and the hotel guests. Just like Upstairs/Downstairs, social station, the war, and family issues are the hot plot topics for this series. The most sympathetic characters are that of the hotel owner John, Charles' fiancee Ruth, and the servants. My only peeve with the series? That its way too short. There are only 8 episodes in the first season set which makes the price a little steep. Also, Unresolved plot threads... Such as the poor drunk girl who had the 'appendicitis' trouble. I wanted to see the villian in that ep get what he deserved. Unfortunately no resoultion. Also...As usual, the poor folks show much more spine than their snobbish and rich 'patrons,' which was a little predictable.Still, this is an excellent series, sure to delight viewers who also like Upstairs Downstairs."
3,Badly in need of English subtitles,"Unless you are familiar with a Cockney English accent you probably will not understand some of the conversations ... particularly those of the kitchen staff. While I am fond of many British productions, I will not purchase any more in the future unless they have English subtitles. I should add, I am not hard of hearing."
3,okay,This was just okay I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would and decided I would not purchase any of the sequels to it.
4,"""Hollywood"" by Budd Schulberg","In addition to being an accomplished novelist (What Makes Sammy Run), Schulberg is the son of the Late B.P. Schulberg who was head of production of Paramount Pictures in its early days. This book is his reminiscence about the silent and early sound days of Hollywood, by someone who was there, hobnobbing with people at the top. It's a fascinating insider account, made all the better by the excellence of Schulberg's writing. If you like books about the early days of Hollywood, don't miss this one."
4,Interesting,Can't remember where I heard that this was the ultimate story of what Hollywood was really like...think it might have been on a Scope DVD of the Dick Cavett Show from the early 1970's...but I remember that both Garson Kanin and Bette Davis on different programs said that Budd Shulberg's book was perhaps the ONLY book that captured the era.Good enough for me...interesting story...
3,A history of the early days of the movies,"I have a number of books on the history of the movies. This book is a more personal history but has a lot of information about the early days of Hollywood and, before that, early days of movie making in New York. Schulberg's father was a movie mogul in the days when those figures were really the titans. He was making and spending $10,000 a week in the 1930s when a good income was $5,000 a year. A very good income. I rate it three stars as the personal stuff was less interesting but it does fill in some of the history before books like Peter Bogdanovich'sWho the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors. It's worthwhile but not one of the first dozen books I would read about Hollywood and movie history."
3,capricious unit,"I agree with Eric. It would be alright if it read all types of media it says in manual.It does not even read all -R's and all -RW's.So please be sure , a lot of the stuff you already have on discs is not gonna be read.If you are only beginning with dvd's buy good brand -r and -rw's.I sent mine back...."
2,A bad buy,"I thought I was making a good investment in buying a name brand dvd player. Only owning it for a short while, it began skipping. Even new dvds skipped. Now I can't play a dvd without skipping. I learned my lesson, do your research before buying anything. The recorder does work. I would diffently buy another product."
5,"Great Recordings, Sleek/ compact Records -minus R/RW","This is a good overall recorder and affordable. I was totally impressed with the unit to copy my favorite shows on Cable (via S-Video input) and the playback with the HDMI signal to my HDTV.The remote control covers it all, the menu and settings are EZ to understand and set up.I strongly recommend that users buy good quality blank media such as Verbatim, TDK, Sony and Panasonic discs. The lower the number (speed ie: 8 X) the better with this unit and any stand alone DVD recorder. Verbatim discs are the best out there. Big drawback is no built in fan, runs hot, and even hotter when turned on long periods.Samsung needs to start installing fans on their DVD recorders for longevity. This is the better model from other Samsungs out there. Stay clear from their dual or dubbing units."
1,Got to use it only once,"Bummer! I got this unit for the firewire input on the front. I plugged a camera in and it worked great! Saw the camera and allowed me to control it. Being all excited I put the equipment away ready to debue it for some people. When I plugged in the firewire, it did not work. Turns out the connector broke. I sent it in for repair and it took 2 months. When I just opened the box, the connector was still broken. The service person said they replaced it, but I see a broken connector with pins pointing in different directions. It is going back again..."
2,Stopped working- common problem with no answer,"I bought this player a few years ago and used it sparingly to record DVDs direct from camcorder DVI input. I was pleased with the many input options it supports including component, S-Video, and DVI. The disks created were playable 90% of the time. I used it to play other DVDs as well for the upconvert feature. Then suddenly one day, it stopped working. The unit displays an ""OPEN DISC"" message and never opens the disc tray. I have contacted Samsung support on numerous occassions with the resolve to be to go to a service center (for a fee of course). With as minimal usage as this thing had, this is a ridiculous break down. If it were more reliable, it would have been a great product."
2,All I kept thinking was...,"This is the Gladiator score. Hans Zimmer protege he might be, but this is too close for comfort in my opinion."
2,One big Cliche',"I bought this book at one of Mr.Dalton's book stores on a whim. It took me over 1 month to read this short book cause every time I would read it I had to keep putting it down based on its absurdity. I would pick it up just to see if it could get any worse, and it never surprised me that it did. The characters are good and they have personality but that's where my compliments stop. I felt like I was reading an old detective story, crammed full of old cliché's but missing the detective. The story line went every which way and was hard to get a grip on. I really can not recommend this book to anyone. Unless you enjoy reading high school creative writing samples, I doubt you will like this book."
5,Great Steel,"Bought this to match up with the individual Shun Classic knives I just bought; it works well and keeps the edge fresh, decreasing the need for honing with a whetstone. Less expensive than I would have expected, too. Recommended."
5,Shun quality,"What can you say? It's a honing steel. What makes this one Shun is the 16 degree angle guide built into the grip which allows you to achieve the precise sharpening angle of the knife. Problem is I'm not sure I'm maintaining that angle as I hone. I may be slipping to a 20 deg. angle or even a 10 deg. So I've got a wobbly wrist. The knife seems to work better after honing, so it must be working. Maybe maintaining a 16 deg honing angle isn't as important as maintaining 16 deg when you're actually sharpening."
1,NOT Made in Japan,"I purchased this item for my boyfriend who has several Shun knives. He already owned a Shun brand sharpening steel, but it clearly says ""Made in China"" which was a bit of a turn off. When I saw this item for sale, I thought it would be a great gift for him! Unfortunately, when it arrived it was clearly the exact same product he already owned, with ""Made in China"" stamped on the handle. Amazon should really correct the listing for this item because it is NOT made in Seki City, Japan!"
1,Not Made in Japan,"Even though the Amazon description says ""manufactured in Seki City, Japan"", mine purchased directly from Amazon was stamped ""Made in China"". If I'm going to pay a premium for this item, I want it to be made in Japan.Further, the seal was broken on mine and looked like it was a return."
2,Made in China?!,"Seems adequate for the job. I expected better from Shun. The ad says it is made in Seki City Japan, but mine is marked made in China."
3,"It's probably good, but not recommend to use on Japanese knives.","I bought it for a week and then returned it, didn't had any chance on using it yet. So, I can't really tell much about this. I've read the pro-knife webpage, and they all recommend of NOT using it on the Japanese knives (the knife blades are harder, and you'll have to sharpen at a low angle, 15-20 degree max. It's harder to hold the knife steady at this angle while steeling it with 1 hand. You may want to try it on the German or American or Chinese knives."
3,Steel is just OK,"Shun makes the best knives that I own. So, why not maintain their edges with a Shun steel? Don't bother. The steel is nicely made but only does a mediocre job. I'll stick with F. Dick sharpening steels from now on."
3,North Alabama Charmer,I would not buy this knife sharpener again. It is too pricey for what it is. I WOULD buy a diamond knife sharpener.
3,Worth reading,"Perhaps some re-editing has taken place because the mistakes that earlier reviews complained about were not obvious in the version I just completed. A definite improvement over ""They were soldiers"". One event that took place set me back pretty hard. I too have been following the Dixon hero since the beginning and I cannot fathom how an author is able to do that to his bread and butter protagonist after 2 decades of dedicated service."
3,The Dixon Family Saga Continues,"I have been following the careers and adventures of Scott and Nathan Dixon from the beginning of this series.I recomend this books and the earlier books in the series. The plots-in this case dealing with the efforts of a terrorist group to embroil the U.S. in a guerilla conflict and inflict a Tet Offesnive like shock to the Ameircan public- allow Mr. Coyle to provide a painless tutorial on the modern United States Army. The tutorial is badly needed, given the state of world affairs. The techno thriller genre is simply a means to that end.Please note plots and character develpoment have improved tremendously since the author's 1980's first efforts. I found myself enjoying the lesson and caring about the Dixons.I recommend this book (and the earlier Dixon/U.S. Army novels)."
4,Best Coyle in a while.,"Best of Coyle's Dixon series since God's Children. Captain Nathan Dixon is the star of the series now and is commanding a Ranger company sent to fight Muslim Terrorists in Southeast Asia. His new Batallion commander is a major jerk and a major problem for Dixon, who is also having challenges in his marriage. Scott Dixon is more father here than Lt General, and there is a great scene with father and son towards the end of the book.I would like to have seen more action and suspense, and I don't like the way key players in past books are discarded: I'll never forgive Coyle for killing off Cerro, and where is Nancy Kozac? still in the Guard somewhere? Find a way to resurrect Cerro and the character we loose in this book, reactivate Kozac, throw in Young Dixon, and my life will be complete again. Also, less military minutiae and more interaction between the soldiers would be nice, too."
5,Cat & Mouse review,"This is an excellent book, as usual with Coyle's books, I've come to expect with all of his books. It is unfortunate what happened but it furthers the plot in all. Thanks again to Mr. Coyle for an excellent book."
4,Fun in the Phillipines,"Between an overzealous terrorist and a control-freak climbing officer, the Dixon family has their work cut out for them in trying to survive the jungle forests. The plot intensifies as the book evolves when the U.S. Army arrives to settle the score with the terrorist."
1,Won't buy another book by this author,"Harold Coyle usually writes a good book. He always captures the dilemmas facing troop commanders and gives us ordinary folks insights into the difficulties of fighting insurgents.This book was ruined by poor editing. There are long, torturous sentences. Commas are either misused or simply AWOL. The text appears to have been used to illustrate every common incorrect word choice for an English class. ""Affect"" for ""effect"" and then vice versa. ""Caulk"" for ""chalk"". ""Wit"" for ""whit"". Perhaps they outsourced the editing to someone who doesn't speak English.The editing put this book in the category of bad fan fiction, which is widely available for free. Unfortunately for me, I paid $8 for the paperback. Unfortunately for Harold Coyle, I won't make that mistake again."
1,Coyle needs a sturdy rocker; he is off his current one,"As a first-time reader of this author, I didn't know what to expect. After over 500 pages of tedium, I will not be reading any more of Coyle's soap operas.He writes of combat force activities as one might who's never been involved in them.Two elite groups, the Army Rangers and the US Marines are in an unbelievable scanario on an island in the Philippines against a force of supposedly fanatic Muslims.Add a Commanding Officer - a stereotypically BAD commander whose sole interest is in his military advancement - who is depicted as a man who is a Colonel in the Army's elite Rangers!Throw in a bunch if hastily described Marines as a bit of frosting, and his depiction of America's finest ground combat military becomes a terrible insult to all Rangers and all Marines.Others have reviewed this book, but I hit the high spots. Not a one!"
1,Worst Edited Book Ever,I couldn't finish it I was so annoyed by the silly plot and the editing. Seriously. Was the manuscript even proofed? I've never seen anything quite this awful.
1,Waste of time.,"I haven't read Coyle for a few years. I wish I hadn't decided to revisit via this miserable example of military fiction. Others have said it: the editing is pathetic. This book reeks of disdain for fans of the genre. This book reminds me why I decided several years ago to move on to something else. In addition to the sixth-grade editing, the substance of the book is weak. The author dallies through 7/10ths of the book describing in detail how marionettes wreak havoc in our military services, then rushes through the climactic battle in a few pages. Weak, unsatisfying, insulting."
3,The devil is in the details...,"For crying out loud use a spell checker and get an editor who speaks English as their primary language! A great yarn was ruined because the finished text reads like Coyle dictated the book to a typist in Bangalore. Referring to an elusive enemy as ""illusive"" is ridiculous. Then there's the gaping ""maul"" of a C-17. A maul is a type of sledgehammer; what gapes on a C-17 is a maw. ""Caulk"" for chalk, ""absconded"" for ensconced - the list goes on. I finally got a pen and started editing the book myself. At more than fifty corrections halfway through I stopped and threw the book away. What a disappointment from a previously stellar author."
3,Cat and Mouse,"Coyle usually writes well constructed, clear, concise novels. In this presentation, ""Cat and Mouse"", such is not the case. His twists and turns make the book interesting although he seems to end his story rather abruptly.The battle scene leaves much to be desired after such a long and interesting introduction. Word usage is a problem in a nunmber of instances and causes one to stop and try to reconcile what has just been read. In short, the whole plot in not truly reflective of Coyles' ability as a novelist and storyteller.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
2,Cat and Mouse---bait and switch,"I have enjoyed almost all of Coyle's novels, and especially those utilitzing the Dixon's. not this one. Way too slow on devloping,""bad gys"" as enemies or on ""our"" side, that are too stupid/blind/etc., to be considered realsave your $ for another novel, and better luck next time,Mr Coyle."
4,Good Stuff,Good insider information. I also just read Hollywood 101 and found it to be a lot more thorough. I would recommend it to anyone interested in joining the Hollywood scene.
4,Why the independents need to take over. . .,". . .a great book detailing what a lot of people already know, Hollywood is full of arrogant, average-talented, bigots. Listen to this and more on, The Indie Film Hour, coming in 2006 to WorldTalkRadio.com. www.vdefiloms.com"
1,"Yes, The Los Angeles River Does Deserve Better","Than this poorly written, haphazard history. The photos aren't even coffee book table quality and are often so cropped as to delete important features that the author may have actually described. This is not for a serious historical reader or for a photo composition review. It fails on all counts."
2,Not very interesting.,"I'm a big fan of ""urban archaeology"" but except for a few cool bridges (if you've ever been to the movies you've seen them) there's not much goin' on these days along the LA river. Its interesting as a story but photographicly its pretty dull, even as an industrial landscape.Its like books on Rt. 66. 99% of what made it interesting isn't there anymore."
1,Too much of a lightweight read,"Admittedly, there aren't many books devoted to the LA river so we have to make do with what's available. Unfortunately, if you're looking for an in-depth historical biography, this certainly isn't it. Entertaining, maybe -- a big maybe. The text is so lightweight and airy, I half expected it to drift away. The Blake Gumprecht book is more thoroughly researched and thought out, and a much better choice."
5,Hard to find,"This CD was discontinued and is extremely hard to find, but thanks to amazon i found it! the CD was awesome too!"
1,Dry and boring,"As a senior architecture student, I find this book very uninteresting. There are chapters that have 55 pages, then the next would have 12 pages. Most of all, they are boring case studies.I am doing well in class but not because of this 'required' book.If I could get $5 for this book when I resell it eventually, I'd be happy."
1,uninteresting,"As a new sole proprietor, I found this book to be essentially worthless. It is weighty, condescending, and lacks practical knowledge. I was looking for concise advise that could be applied to running a successful business in the new service economy, what I found was a ""compendium"" of old world ideas.Read the book ""Blur"" instead."
5,Goood rogue sub yarn,Good rogue sub yarn. Irving A. Greenfield's novel is about a submarine called the Barracuda. It's captained by an ultra-patriot who sees commies everywhere. One of the first ships the submarine attacks is a ship called the African Wolf. The captain thinks that the United States and the Soviet Union are at war so he decides to attack what he perceives to be enemy shipping. He's supposed to be participating in war games but he's taken them too far. Read this book to find out more.
5,Not Just for Wife Beaters,"Although I wish the book spent less time assuming all its readers were wife beaters who could use a trip to jail to cool off, I found its techniques very reasonable and helpful. Although I never have and never will hit a woman or child, I still tend to get angry too easily. Don't let the book's subtitle fool you into thinking it is only for marital fights/anger. If you get angry at your boss, your siblings, your parents, your kids, or random drivers, this book's techniques can help you. I'd like to see a version intended for people like me who are often angry but never violent. I'd also like to see a version for angry women, because not every woman is a victim of an angry man, as this book implies. Despite its faults, it is an immensely valuable book, and relevant to you if you are reading this review."
3,Anger Busting 101,"This is an excellent beginning towards coping with anger caused by the direct or politically correctness forced onto you by the status quo. I suggest reading material that may be closer in relation to your own beliefs and that particular author may assist in coping with the world. For example, Goad is the author for a book called The Redneck Manifesto. Entertaining but a different perspective of things."
5,Moving beyond anger,"Newton pulls it all together in a highly readable and well researched book that describes the dynamics of anger and how men can move beyond anger in relationships. What works for some people in expressing anger becomes a deadly trap for others and Hightower exlains how men can recognize their dilemma and reestablish a more positive relationship with the women in their lives. A must read for psychotherapists, men with anger control issues, and wives of men whose predominant mode of expression is anger."
2,"I'm sure this is helpful, but.......","It focuses on men who hit women, not on men who need to deal with anger constructively. Just not what I was looking for."
1,Not accurate,"Some images used in this program are Japanese pictures from various periods. One of them is Prince Shotoku from 6th century in Japan and nothing to do with this program. I began to wonder what is correct and what is not. So, I stopped watching it."
5,Excellent One Hour Film,"Film is excellent....several known scholars in the field of Asian history are talking heads among the recreated battle shots, etc. An intro and voice-over by Peter Graves during the film provide enough info for someone embarking on a study of the Yuan Empire or the Mongol Empire."
1,Do not buy!,"I bought this VCR about three weeks ago at K-mart. It started eating my tapes 2 weeks ago so I took it back to K-mart ,they wouldn't take it back because I didn't have the box - what a stupid policy!! I then wrote a e-mail to Sylvania requesting a refund or replacement for the VCR telling them I still had the receipt and the accessories. I got a message back saying I would receive a response in 1 business day. That has been at least a week ago and still haven't heard anything. Sylvania's equipment is obviously made cheap and their Customer Service is horrible! Do not buy anything from them or K-mart!"
1,piece of junk,"When my old VCR gave up the ghost after several fruitful years, I replaced it with the Sylvania because I didn't want to spend a lot of money with DVD coming in strong. I moved to a new, smaller apt. and gave away all my tapes. I had a couple blank tapes if there was anything crucial I would want. My son needed some Animal Planet stuff (not on his cable company). I taped the first few shows OK, although there was no visible running tape counter. Then when I clicked on again to tape a show he wanted (he's a zookeeper) the screen suddenly said, English or Spanish. I thought I clicked on ""English"", but Spanish came up. Now all screen choices are in Spanish, but I can't get out of the loop for regular recording. I could get a picture, and the red recording light would go on, but it wasn't recording anything. And a tape I had with a program on it, it would not play back. I am stuck with thie piece of junk."
1,Sylvania 6260VD 4-Head VCR,I ordered this product twice and returned it twice. Both had problems...different problems
4,Recalled = High Prices,"First off, this figure is not that hard to find on the big auction site. Paying More than $[...] for one is CRAZY. With that said, this figure *should* go up in value, but ONLY because it was recalled by the estate and not for it's glorious detail.The figure is based on Freddie from the video's ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" and ""Don't Stop Me Now"". The jacket being from the latter. The Freddie Mercury estate were NOT happy and never gave final approval before it was shipped. They gave NECA a cease and desist and all of the figures were supossed to be recalled to be destroyed.Some made it out alive. I own two of these and I prefer them over the ""Wembley"" figure NECA made first. If you want it cheaper, don't buy it here."
1,Don't waste your time,This program is good if you want to use one of the pre-existing designs on it. If you plan on building a custom deck it is pretty much useless. You are unable to make the angles you want and you are unable to add specific designs that are fairly common. It is difficult to use and is not worth the money spent. You are better off drawing a custom deck by hand.
1,Absolutely worthless,"I paid $29.99, but Deck Designer would be overpriced at $2.99. A highschool student could create a better program over a weekend. You can use a pencil, ruler and paper as easily. No way I would build a deck this program creates. It actually put overlapping posts in nearly the same hole, and a third post only inches away. A ""door"" is literally a hole in the wall. Only one 3D view and it's not in perspective so it looks wrong. There is very little you can do with this worthless program. The only good thing it is easy to use. Too easy! And you still get nothing you can build. Don't waste your money. Even 1 star is too high a rating for this product."
1,Worthless...absolutely worthless...,"Not much more I can say other than this software was of zero value for me building my deck. If you really want it, look at home depot for a down load for much, much cheaper. I think the web designer at Lowes provides the same value as this software....but it is FREE!!!!!!"
1,of limited value,I agree with other comments and requested (and received) refund from software company.
3,Do not freeze,After letting it fully freeze in my freezer a few times some of the plastic on the sides broke and it began to leak.
3,Beginners Only,I think this video is a decent and brief introduction to the Renaissance for those who know virtually nothing about this fascinating period of history. If you have an interest in learning much more about this subject I would recommend purchasing from THE TEACHING COMPANY one of their many fine DVD courses on the Renaissance.
2,B rated for Booooring,"I bought it and now I'm stuck with it. What could be more exciting than the Industrial Revolution - big machines, human ingenuity plainly visible, profound changes in society.And what could be more boring than a couple of talking heads analyzing these issues, insulating us from the artificats themselves, which are available in museums - both as exhibits and as working models - throughout Europe and the U.S.Sad."
2,Slow and Boring,"I'm a high school history teacher and would not recommend this - they ought to call it ""Just the Boring Facts."""
4,"If you like Musica Nortena, you will like this CD",This is Ana Barbara's first CD from 1995 and is one of her best. The majority of the songs are Ranchera or Nortena. Ana Barbara's voice is as clear and lovely as it is on her next three albums although it is less well trained. If you are an Ana Barbara fan it is worth adding to your collection.
1,Stopped working,This iron was good..that is while it worked. Just stopped working (no power) after 6 months--and very limited use. Maybe used 12 times!Not good..
5,Good quality full-size CD jewel cases,"In my experience, the RCA full-size CD jewel cases are of good quality. Although they are not exactly inexpensive, they are not as fragile as jewel cases made by other manufacturers. Having an extensive classical music CD collection, I have found the RCA jewel cases to be very useful as replacements for those jewel cases which have become cracked as a result of rough handling or accidents. I also prefer using full-size CD jewel cases to slim CD cases for storing home-made music CDs."
1,Images is incorrect,"The product is actually fine, a jewel case is a jewel case. The problem here is that you will not receive the product in the image above. You will receive a 10-pack of cd cases with clear trays (not black). The description says ""clear plastic"" which Amazon intends to mean that the entire product is clear plastic and not just the outer shell. Two more words in the bullet point would have cleared it up. They will refund your purchase and shipping once you notice, though."
5,Jewel cases,product was exactly as described-arrived in excellent condition and in a very timely manner
1,Be careful,Item pictured does not match what is actually sent. You will get clear cases sent instead of the regular black backed style as shown.
2,The videos are not what they seem,"Remember those homemade tapes you had of the series when it aired originally? Unless your cable went on the fritz or you forgot to hit the record button after the commercial break, the copies were good enough to satisfy your cravings for cherry pie, a cup of joe and the whole wacky Twin Peaks gang. Hopefully you never lost them but if you did...Hurray! Because someone found your copies and dubbed them and over dubbed them and packaged them into this really poor quality set from some company called ""Worldvision"" A company who likes to re-sell garbage from your curb back to you. If you're desperate like me, don't have a DVD player, and are wary of e-bay, this unfortunately is your only alternative."
1,Warning - Garbage Alert - Peakers Beware,"Geez, $$$ for 5 episodes sounds like a bargain huh? Don't fall for it. I love Twin Peaks, but I was shocked to see how [bad] the quality is. I was dumb enough to buy the entire series in this 6 hour format, so it took a little while before I got to watch enough to see how horrible the quality is. I am surprised to see that they are still selling this. I am hopeful that the series will be available on DVD in the future and if it is I hope they do a decent job of digital remastering."
3,New world disconnect,"Interesting, this is big in England, where they are viewed as being one of the Next Big Things, and there's apparently no notice stateside. These guys get compared to Coldplay, but I don't see it, they remind me more of a less-affected Suede. This is their first album, and it's pretty much formula rock, but well played with decent song writing and good vocals.I don't know where they go, they could find something unique to say with this kind of apparent talent or they could get absorbed into the mainstream sludge. It's not the kind of record I would play much, but if you trust the mother country then check it out, it's certainly pleasant enough."
1,Pathetic,"Actually, I can only review the first 18 pages. That's as far as I got before I had to put it down and take several aspirin. I had just read the scene where Lowe had put ""LA's favorite party-girl reporter"" and his hero in the reporter's Lamborghini Diablo VT at 100 MPH after drinking several shots at a political event. Let's see -- mid-30's reporter, renowned as a partier, owns a $50,000+ car and drives it fast and drunk. Sounds about right for this guy. I mean, c'mon, this level of prose is typically laughed out of most college creative writing classes. Maybe Lowe lived this story, but he should have hired someone else to write it. I'm thinking maybe Danielle Steele might have brought considerably more credibility and gravitus to this effort."
3,Mixed feelings,"The book was pretty good. If I hadn't known it was basically a true story I wouldn't have believed it at all. It was, to say the least, enlightening. The worst part is when the author starts going into lecturing about morality and philosophy like in an Ayn Rand novel or something. Most of the book is dialogue and description of sex scenes but every now and then the author goes off on a tangent about ""universal ethics"" and ""alpha males"", etc. Sometimes I think the main character thinks he's the guy from ""Good Will Hunting"" or something. I actually agreed with most of what he said, but the last thing I want to see after reading a story about sex and corruption is the guy rationalizing everything."
3,a perfect beach novel,"There is certainly a way to read this book for its point of view of politics, or for its reference to a peculiar episode in the recent history in Californian politics. I happened to have read it on vacation in California last summer, mostly by the pool. I enjoyed it tremendously as that---breezy, light, transient and fun. If only politics, even Californian politics, were all that."
2,Tom's done it again,"Not only has Mr. Lowe, in his most recent book been able to trash on all of his former employers - he's done it for personal gain and with a smile. Can anyone say Clinton?"
5,Wild! Stunning!,"This book reads like watching a movie. Who would have thought California politics was so glamorous -- sex, money, fashion models, limos. After reading SPIN, I'm ready to sign up with the Republicans!"
1,Ugh.,This book was utterly unremarkable. Slogging through to the end was sheer punishment. The reader is consistently thumped with cliches and dully bombarded with clunky dialogue in a muck of obtuse style. The characters are neither interesting nor endearing in their banality. The book reads more like a wet dream than a novel. Do not say you were not warned
4,"good political info, needs improvement","For a first book, SPIN isn't bad at all. The writing isn't the greatest I've ever read but at least there is a good story. The style sounds fairly pedestrian and there are a lot of cuss words, but you can't help liking the character Jim Asher in the end even though he can be a real a-hole in parts of the book. I expect Mr Lowe (who looks about 20yrs old) will be growing up before writing future books, if that's what he intends to do. I think a lot of people will get some laughs from SPIN. I wish I had the money to send a copy to all the congressmen in Washington. It might make them see how stupid it all looks in writing."
4,"An addictive novel, very thought-provoking","Tom Lowe manages to frame some of life's important ethical delimnas inside an entertaining story. Don't expect a classic piece of literature, but Spin is for you if you want to read some contemporary historical fiction that makes an impact. At times the novel becomes a bit trashy, but the quality of the storytelling overrides the author's excursions into unimportant topics."
3,0-9 Brain Calculator,"How does a digital calculator perform calculation? How does an abacus perform calculation? Now, how does our brain perform calculation? It's a combination of the analogies Abacus and digital calculator. The author creatively embarks on this very principle to trigger our minds calculating power. It requires concentration and dedication to follow the examples in this book. As in any achievable skill, it requires practice and more practice."
1,"This math does work, but the books are terrible in representing it.","All of these books that keep popping up saying you can do the math in your mind in seconds, are correct in one way. Yes, you can do it...in fact you can do pretty massive equations using #'s in the millions or below, (or higher). The thing that is terrible about all of these books is they sound like a modern day memory book or such. They are ALL based upon what is called Vedic math. It was the math form used thousands of years ago...generally dating around the Summerian culture.Vedic math really does work...in fact it's quite mind-blowing to put out answers to a large group of #'s just as someone finishes reading the problem! : ) Check out websites based upon Vedic math, or buy books directly relating to Vedic math...there's more to it than just putting it in print."
2,where's the memory tricks ?,"you'd think that a man known for teaching memory tricks to people would show you how to remember these math tricks, wouldn't you? he doesn't. no different than any other rapid math book out there."
2,Compatibility issues,"I have had terribly frustrating compatibility issues with this Lens cleaner.It worked on my PC drive.It however is NOT recognized as valid media on two of my stand alone DVD players.Very weird. I have had the Discwasher products BEFORE RCA took them over. They worked fine. Now that RCA has their hand in it, Some players have it work, some it does not.If one goes to the RCA site, you will find that there is virtually NO support for the Discwasher products, so that I have no place see about a fix.I would recommend a pre-RCA Discwasher cleaner or a different brand of lens cleaner.Jon"
3,"Well, it's better than the plague!!!","I am the author of this satire about religion, and it was my first book. AFter all these years, I just read it again, and honestly, there's a lot of good stuff in it. The story arc is clumsy, seems like I rushed to the finish, and then was only half through! But still, if anything else I write ever becomes well known, I don't think I'll be too embarassed about this first effort. My advice to new authors is to not be afraid of what anyone thinks, but to make sure you really do have the basic craft down pat, and then learn the art of storytelling---by doing so. If you happen to get published ""too early"", you'll catch some flak, but there are worse things!"
4,Better have tough innards,"After the horrific ending in Sin City 1, I wasn't sure I could handle another in the series. Enter Sin City 2, ""A Dame to Kill For,"" and photographer Dwight McCarthy. Not the coolest guy in the world, but, then I guess it fits the genre. His life is ugly and boring. He'd like to make some changes, but then Ava returns from his past. Sleazy Dwight falls hard, again, and the result is violent, sadistic and infatuating.Don't know how many of these I can take, but I am hooked on the visual, comic book imagery Miller creates. I'd definitely not recommend this book for teenagers (my 13-year-old is my sample) or for the faint-of-heart."
4,A violent tale of betrayal and Marv,"A great book written and illustrated by Frank Miller, this is a tale of Sin City and a man named Dwight. Dwight has been kicked down and made to suffer all his life. The hits just keep on coming. His only aid comes from a freakish human monster named Marv and deadly prostitutes with a happy trigger finger. Give this tale of death and betrayal a try, and you'll never escape from Sin City"
5,"An excellent continuation, travelling even deeper into the bowels of Sin City","After reading the first of the SIN CITY comics, ""The Hard Goodbye"", and seeing the SIN CITY movie, I went out to pick up ""A Dame to Kill For"". Once again, I was surprised at how much better it was than your average comic.The story is set before ""The Hard Goodbye"" and focuses on Dwight, a photographer who is shocked when his former love, Ava, returns to him. But things are not as they seem. Are they ever in Sin City?Everyone's favorite character, Marv, re-appears, and numerous reoccuring characters appear for the first time. Frank Miller is at his finest: Sin City has never looked so dark and grimy. The story is great, the dialogue is great, the characters are great. ""A Dame to Kill For"" is an excellent continuation, and no comic book fan will want to pass it up."
5,Works beautifully,This underwater housing worked beautifully. Used it all week in Bonaire and it worked like a charm. Had full control over my camera and never caused any problems. I've got underwater pictures at http://www.theshroyers.com/bonaire/snorkel.shtml
5,Great for a non-diver,"This is a great item to buy if you have one of the Canon Powershot cameras that fit this case. It is easy to load and and all of the buttons line up. So, all of the camera functions are still usable. The one trick to use it though under water is using the screen to compose your picture rather than a view finder. I was not wearing a mask, so I had to guess on my shots.Instead of just pool shots of my kids, I plan on taking underwater pictures of the fish I catch this summer. I also plan on having my wife use the case when she goes to the beach. So, a shovel full of sand or a splash of salwater will not be a problem. I am not a diver, so I can't make a recommendation on this item for that specific use.There is a trick to loading the camera into the case, but Canon's directions are simple and informative. So, despite the rather high price, anyone that has one of these cameras and would like to use it around water should have one of these cases."
1,Canon does not provide warranty coverage!,"I recently received a similar Canon waterproof case and found after the first use the the glass lens cover was permanently fogged thus preventing any further photos. Obviously a manufacturing defect. The glass lens cover is composed of two layers and once fogged cannot be de-fogged or wiped. Canon provided ZERO support for their waterproof cases and should this happen you are completely out of luck!Their email reply to my request for help:"" Unfortunately the water-proof housings do not come with any kind ofwarranty expressed or implied in any way. The manual that comes withthe housing is to be followed in performing maintenance on the waterproof housing and is strictly up to the user to comply with theprocedures in the manual.I am sorry for the inconvenience, but we cannot provide you withany real assistance with this matter.Sincerely,Technical Support Representative"""
1,Mine leaked and ruined my camera,"After using the case on about 5 dives over the course of 11 months, it leaked. I read the instructions, followed all of the instructions carefully and it still leaked. And now my camera is ruined. I certainly learned my lesson and next time I will buy a specific underwater camera (but first I have to replace my digital camera that got ruined)."
5,Works as advertised,"Not much to say about this. It promises to keep the camera dry underwater, and has worked as advertised for me on several occassions.Note: READ THE DIRECTIONS!!! The most important things to remember when using any underwater camera housing are1) prepare the housing in a cool, air conditioned area,2) make very sure that the rubber seal and surrounding area are free of hairs, sand, etc.,3) DO NOT repeatedly open and close the housing after it has been prepared, and before you dive (snorkel, whatever).Just be mindful of what you're doing, use some common sense, and this will work great."
3,decent overview,"This book is designed to refresh the memory of someone who already has a good understanding of all topics. It does not, however, clarify or re-teach the concepts. This book has very limited educational value."
1,SO SMALL!!!,"I only paid 39.99 and it was still a rip-off. It says it's 1 inch by 1 inch, but it's about the size of a dime!!! So dissappointed. Sending it back."
1,please bring this back,"I saw this item a while ago.....put off ordering and when I was ready to order, it was not available any longer! Please bring this item back."
3,Bio-Patrick Henry DVD,Was an okay characterisation of this forgotten founder. Would like to have seen more about what he did prior to his role towards independence. Mid 90s format could do with a digital upgrade to improve interest. For fans of Patrick Henry you can certainly buy the DVD but a book would get my vote due mainly to the 90s format which did make the storyline feel a little dated.
1,Broderund 3D Home Arch 5.0,"Not at all intuitive, 3.0 was better. Takes forever to get a drawing in there, dimensions are hard to get correct, confusing 'snapping' parameters. Views are better than 3.0, that's it.There has to be something better out there."
1,Too one-sided for a serious and important subject,"This is an important and serious social problem that is not helped by one-sided accounts such as this. Most of the chapters cite very few or no sources for their information, and most of those that are cited are from newspaper articles, not empirical data sources. That there is an agenda here is obvious from the carefully edited opening quote in chapter 1 by James Baldwin. Instead of the entire quote in which Baldwin describes a dilemma that is neither entirely the fault of one side or the other, it is edited to make it appear to fit the agenda.If you already have your mind made up that you don't like police and the problem is as simple as ""police are bad and everyone is a victim,"" then by all means you should buy this book. If you would rather read an objective view of a serious problem that needs to be addressed, however, there are plenty of others out there."
4,Still a great book.,"Don't be fooled, this is three old books stuffed into a new cover. Die-hard McCaffery fans beware: don't buy this one if you own all the others!But people new to the Dragonriders of Pern series? It's a great, inexpensive way to get the backstory on all your favorite characters! It's a terrific story about survival and friendship. I recommend it.For you people that have read all the books and are looking for something new: Dragon's Kin, by Anne McCaffery just came out (I'm writing this Dec. 2003) and go check out that one! Haven't read it yet, but it sounds great and I'm looking forward to it!"
1,Caution - read the book's description before buying,"As other reviewers have written, its actuallya combination of three of her previous andold books.Expecting to reading a new book, I was surprisedto find out that I have already read and havethese books.No one to blame but myself since I should haveread the description more carefully..."
3,Not your normal Caedmon's Call,"I'm having a difficult time with this album so far. As a big Caedmon's Call fan, I would purchase any CD they release. However, this one (after a few listenings) would not be one of my favorites. I'm not a huge fan of world music, which is unavoidable on this disc. The absence/influence of former co-front man Derek Webb is very noticeable. There are some songs that are vinatge Caedmon's, but if you're not a big fan, I strongly recommend listening to some online clips before purchasing. If you have loved their other work (which is obviously of varying styles), then invest in this release as well."
1,AWFUL!,First I must admit that I bought the album without having heard it or researched it first. So it is entirely my fault that I purchased this album expecting it to be at least something like all the other Caedmons Call music that I truly enjoy.WOW! BIG MISTAKE! I REALLY CAN NOT ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE HOW BAD THIS REALLY SOUNDS! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT! IS THIS THE SAME BAND? THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!
2,Not What I expected,"I got this CD because of the song ""There's Only One (Holy One)"". I REALLY like this song; it's so beautiful! However, the rest of the CD sounds like folk music, not contemporary Christian music. I might listen to this CD from time to time, but it is not my favorite. I only really like 2 songs. ""Share the Well"" is ok. Also, some of the tracks aren't really full songs, they're clips of people talking and stuff like that."
1,does not work to charge / jump anything,"save your money it drains in 5 minutes even charging just a cell phone. Nothing will get a full charge.Forget trying to jump your car battery, I could never get it to work even when new and fully charged. what a waste of money."
4,Good history.,"Excellent review of northwestern rail history. Indispensable for any Seattle-ite who is in any way curious about the history of settlement in this region, or the railroad's importance in the region's growth and destiny. Nice layout, good pictures, though no color."
2,Tape player-Panasonic,Tape drive is faulty. Tape warbles. I bought it to transfer cassettes to disc but could not proceed because quality of sound was so poor.
1,Poor Frequency Response,"It was a mistake to buy this product because it has a very thin or cheap sound quality. I played an analog recording of The Tocatta and Fugue in D-minor by J. S. Bach on it and was very disappointed in the poor frequency response it delivered. Nothing below about 80 hertz is even audible. The upper frquencies are also weak and the unit does not play loud enough. To top all this off, the battery life is not anywhere near what is being claimed. Very, very dissappointing. This one is going into the trash after only a few hours of use."
5,I liked it.,"I carry the machine on my hip throughout the day and listen to books on tapes. And it works just fine. It uses two AA batteries, and I use to machines that use one, but it seems a lot sturdier than I am used to and does not break as easily."
2,has several shortcommings,"1. manual says not to play any cd's with paper labels or with writing on the cds. If you could see the trays you would no why. They are very shallow. If you create a cd on your computer, how are you suppose to label it?2. AM radio is pathetic. Does not pick up any stations at all. Rate a 0. FM radio is fine3. auxillery input is poor. It provides no volume.4. the speakers use non standard wiring and the manual says do not use any speakers but the ones provided."
5,Great Audio System,"I just bought this stereo 2 days ago and I love it, the sound quality is amazing and it's got so much power, I haven't turned it up all the way but even when it's on low it sounds powerful and clear. You can choose between the equalizer settings from clear to heavy depending on what you are listening to. It also has a timer that will wake you up in the morning. Setting up the unit is simple and brainless. The only complaint is that the main unit is rather long from the front to the end and it didn't quite fit snuggly in my bookcase but it still looks good though. Very nice stero with a great contemporary look and it's a great price."
2,Don't do it,"Like the other reviewer, I wanted to buy this unit for the looks, but after listening to it in the store, I couldn't do it. I took in my favorite CDs, but they sounded thin and flat, kind of ""tinny.""I bought the Sharp XLHP500 instead, which is just as attractive and has wonderful, full, rich sound too. It holds only 3 CDs, and I would have preferred 5, but it was worth it to get better sound quality. And 3 is really pretty adequate.I also looked at the Sony CMT HP7, but discovered it does not have play exchange, which I really wanted. And the Sharp was a good bit less expensive."
4,A Handy Guide to Things Freakish in Film,"Jack Hunter makes clear his purpose at the end of the preface to INSIDE TERADOME: ""This book is also written from the viewpoint that 'bizarre' films...represent the pinnacle of cinematic art, since any artistic medium can only be explored to its full potential when used to express imaginative extremes.""That said, he has produced a wonderful catalog and commentary on films and photographic media that feature human anomalies, both genetic/organic (little people, giants) and man-made (tattooed people), both at the sideshow or for the movies. From Tod Browning's classic FREAKS to the pictures of Joel-Peter Witkin, from THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI to Jodorowsky's SANTE SANGRE to David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN, Hunter has managed to cover it all.This book is *loaded* with pictures, letting you in on the freakish details in case your local video store isn't this broadminded."
4,Dune By CD...,I first started using dune when i recieved it as a gift. I have never looked elsewhere ever since. This fragrance isnt too strong or overwhelming. The scent lingers on all day.
3,So-So,"Seams a bit diluted version of the full-sized perfume, however slightly more-concentrated than the DUNE by Christian Dior After Shave 3.4 oz. Purely packed - a big empty box with a small perfume box ""flying inside"". Came with an over-screwed cap slightly cracked - not leaked luckily!No deviation in the aroma from the original version of the perfume quite stable over 2-3 day period. Probably good choice for the price, but the volume is 10 ml or 0.34 Oz."
3,Nice sample,"The Dune eau de toilette arrived very quickly. Before I got it, I was unfamiliar with the scent, but I bought it for someone who loves Frank Herbert's ""Dune."" Its smell, to me, is pretty gender-neutral. The writing on the bottle is not so satisfactory--like it's a decal and it had been scratched off a little."
4,I THINK THIS ALBUM IS GREAT!,I WAS LOOKING FOR A SINGER NOT TOO WELL KNOW HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. HE ONLY PRODUCED ONE ALBUM I THINK HIS NAME IS CHILINO SANCHEZ. IF ANYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT LET ME KNOW.
1,Most certainly not worth buying...,"I personally do not reccomend this book. There are many errors in it, incomplete walkthrus and pointlists. Inconsistencies are numerous in this book as well. This was definately NOT worth the money I paid for it. The only good thing about it, really, was the screen-shots (B&W, though). All-in-all, good for collectors, bad for gamers; it gets the official ""Herk Thumbs-Down"""
1,Completely inaccurate.,"I've done extensive reasherch on The Life, as well as the comon veiws, of Cleopatra VII. Out of all of the books I have read, this has to be the worst. Do not let the sub-title ""dreams and distortions"" distract you. This book looks at Cleopatra as her enemies veiwed her, as a witch and a whore. I would not recomend this book for anyone who is truly interested in the life of the great Cleopatra VII. Don't waiste you time and money on this poor excuse for a biography. I would, though, like to recomend a historical novel, on Cleopatra by Margret George. Although it is technicly non fiction, it is extreemly historicly acurate as well as I great book to read.~* Mikisha Anne ..."
1,Not worth the read,"This book was suggested in the kindle newsletter as something life changing. I stayed with it to the end though many times i felt melancholy! It just didnt rate in my opinion. It was torture trying to get through it and i kept hoping for something to turn around. I wanted insight to his world and what made him the way he was, but i just never bonded with the character."
4,Witty and Memorable,"When I first sat down with this book, I had to run and grab a pencil to underline all the phrases that punched me. I wasn't expecting a book with ""Melancholy"" in the title to make me laugh so much or smile at the human truths our narrator wittily uncovers. I'm not much of a fan of stories about characters who cannot love (ho hum), but this theme did not detract from this novel's power. A few chapters in, I was reminded of The World According to Garp and thought this might be a good suggestion for fans of John Irving-- quirky and not always sympathetic characters dealing with the sometimes harsh realities of modern America. Thank you, Nancy Pearl, for reviving this treasure."
2,NPR suggested reading for summer by Nancy Pearl,"Heard about this on National Public Radio as a good read for summer. Was not all that thrilled about it. Seems to be an autobiographical piece on the author's life as a super intelligent, misunderstood, and obviously mentally tormented individual. Kept waiting for an uplifting end as he contemplates his suicide. It was not there."
1,Not worth the time,"I can't remember the last time I rated a book one star. Although, most reviewers like this story, I found it to be 500 pages of self-loathing and cynicism. I had an extremely hard time getting through it. In a nut shell, the book is about a man named Joshua who has accomplished many great things in his life, but has never emotionally bonded with anyone or anything. As he contemplates ending his life he decides to record some of his experiences in an attempt to understand himself. The entire book is depressing. I found it hard to care for the main character and really didn't care about the overall story line."
4,Truth be told,"Joshua Bland is not a man to be envied. However, we as readers of his life, may, indeed learn something. Disadvantaged in ways most of us never will be, Bland is brutal in his self assessment. Today, as psychoanalyzed as we are, we would perhaps not be as harsh. I read this very carefully, felt the pain, winced at parts and, foremos,t admired the honesty of emotion and regret. An easy read? No, a worthy one, yes."
5,A Gay and Melancholy Sound,"This book is part of the wonderful Book Lust Rediscovery series devoted to reprinting some of the best out of print novels.This (perhaps) autobiographical novel about an individual who feels no emotional connection because of past experiences, is very thought provoking and really timeless. I look forward to more books in this reprint series. There are many more lost gems out there that still have unbelievable connection to the present such as this one."
5,No-escapism,"One of the best books I have read in many years. One of the qualities of great fiction is that it's the exact opposite of escapism. Literary fiction never lets the reader off the hook, and the challenge we face when reading something like this novel is the same challenge we face when reading works like Sophie's Choice or Revolutionary Road. If you are looking for fiction that offers an easy diversion from reality or some uplifting moral conclusion, don't look here."
1,"I, Me, My, Mine","Borrowed this turkey for free on Kindle and still feel ripped-off.Joshua Bland (how apt) is self-loathing, egocentric and completely uninterestingyet apparently convinced that others will be fascinated with his life. Masterpiece of miscaliculation!!!I am now very suspect of any recommendation of Nancy Pearl.A complete waste of time..........."
4,Fits My Chihuahua Perfectly!,"Very cute jersey, and the size was just right for my 5 to 6 lb. chihuahua. It's important to measure your dog, since every dog outfit is sized differently. The fabric is maybe a little bit cheap, and that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. But that's OK. Ethel isn't going to wear it every single day -- just on special occasions."
5,A truly fascinating book,"I was very surprised to see that some reviewers consider this book hard to read. I found it very clear and well organized, and most interesting. The writing flows well, the explanations are very good. I liked that the author doesn't waste your time in nebulous theories and farfetched deductions, as some will.There is a great deal of information, more than I thought was available on Neanderthals. Of course, scientific advance have helped to a degree. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to any one with an interest in early man."
3,Long sentences and a dictionary necessary,"However an interesting subject, I find a majority sentences entirely too long. At times it becomes cumbersome reading. An anthropological definition of the many unaccustomed words and their usage would help the lay person in reading and understanding the book."
3,It Works,"I purchased the chauvet mushroom about 2 weeks ago, it seems to work as advertised, but the issue I have with it is the sound activation seems very random , the beams either jerk left or right a bit, or spin constantly and it seems that unless you barely turn the knob then the sound activation doesn't work at all, (there is really no variable sound level input it's on or off) overall I am unimpressed with chauvet products I also purchased a chauvet B250 bubble machine that was basically a squirt gun that shot bubble juice all over everything and blew about 50 bubbles a min (a 5 year old with a bubble wand could do better and spill less fluid)I used the recommended ""chauvet bubble juice"" that costs twenty bucks a gallon and tried the regular cheapo juice the cheap stuff actually worked better maybe 70 bubbles a min at five bucks a gallon...... I think that chauvet products are hit or miss (mostly miss from my experience so far)."
1,"Good music, bad recording","Music was very good, but ythe recording levels varied trememdnously from song to song. Some of the recordings were so bad, there was rattling from interference. I thought I blew my speakers. Changed to a new CD and everything is fine. Can't recommend."
5,Telling it how it is. . .,"With all the drama and emotion of a movie on the subject, torando chaser Tim Mosier tells what is is like to be face-to-face with nature's most awesome wonder. Where most people have only witnessed the power and destruction of tornadoes through films, TV and second-hand stories-Mosier has had the unique experience of coming close-just one time to many for one lifetime. And in his book 'Twisters in the Heartland' he combines an understanding of the phenomenon for the average person with the realism of the moment as it takes place-through the destructive aftermath. His work as a member of an emergency management team has put him in the bird's eye view of the often bizarre situations created by a twister-ranging from having to watch helpless people sit through the storm from atop a stalled ferris wheel-to the sight of a pile of cars suddenly stacked on top of each other next to a telephone pole. Fascinating, compelling and informative."
5,TWISTERS IN THE HEARTLAND IS A VERY EXCITING BOOK,"THE BOOK TWISTER'S IN THE HEARTLAND BY TIM D MOSIER, I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY EXCITING AND EDUCATIONAL , MR. MOSIER MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAVING HUNDERED'S OF LIVE'S, IT WAS PACKED WITH ACTION AND SHOWED VERY MUCH HOW TWISTER'S CAN DESTROY HOME'S AND LIVE'S . I WOULD STRONGLY ADVICE THE PUBLIC TO BUY THIS BOOK AND PASS IT ALONG TO THERE FAMILY MEMBER."
3,Sucked down by errors,"Tim Mosier's first-hand accounts of tornado experiences are terrific but this book is swirling with spelling errors, grammatical errors, typographical errors and factual errors. Who editing this thing? Anyone? What a pity as this is not so much a book as a manuscript for a book before an editor and proofreader did their work. This is not to imply criticism of the author. He's done a great job and the book is riveting start to finish. But how could any publisher publish a book this messy?"
2,Maybe they had a bad day at the plant...,"I recently purchased these because I was out of town helping a friend in need, and decided to try to strip an old piece of furniture he had sitting in the basement...and because they said the edges were ""prepared"" and all of my sharpening tools and files were 700 miles away. I own a really nice set of Two Cherries chisels that are awesome, so my expectations were high. I'm sorry to say that these two scrapers did not meet my definition of ""prepared"". In fact, I had to give up on the project because they were tearing up the wood. I purchased my first scraper at Sears made by Bahco long before I had even heard of preparing the edges properly...and that one worked great for several months right out of the package without saying it was ""prepared"". Like I said in the title, maybe they just were having a bad day at the Two Cherries plant...but I'd say know how to properly prepare your scraper before purchasing these."
3,Good product for scraping difficult to plane pieces,"This is a great product, has a sharp edge right out of the packing and easy to handle. The only con is that the edge is honed at a steep angle."
2,Works well but rusted very quickly,"It worked well and holds a decent edge but just a few weeks after getting it quite a bit of rust showed up. I didn't do anything different with this tool than any of my others. It goes in the toolbox in my garage. I live in Upstate NY and we don't have a terrible amount of humidity. Anyway, I'd hope that it wouldn't rust as badly as it did and would think that a ""quality steel"" would do better than this. No one else complained of this, so perhaps I got one from a bad batch."
3,Definitely an Intro book,"On the plus side this book includes all the bases that are usually covered in a couple or more books. Has Yin and Yang of foods, contrast between Western and Eastern concepts of nutrition and food harmony, 30 common ailments that can be helped by food (again by Western and Eastern concepts), and over 60 intermediate level recipes.The two authors do a good job in integrating such a complex topic and simplifying it for cooks to embrace the overall Chinese wisdom for TCM in everday life. It helps to have some prior experience in cooking Chinese, as there is not too much on the art and technique. No pictures or illustrations.I saw a similar book which is more complete, Nina Simond's ""A Spoonful of Ginger,"" at double the price. It has pix and explains concepts more thoroughly. It is also very pretty."
4,hard to find vitamins,It is not easy to find vitamins for this age group. In the stores you will only find vitamins for adults and small children. I'm glad I can get these for my 12 year old son. He seems to tolerate them just fine.
1,Patio Designer is Terrible,"I wasted my money on this software - don't make the same mistake. It's non-intuitive, inflexible, cumbersome, and does nothing that you can't do yourself in 15 minutes with a pencil and paper. Does not allow you to design a custom patio - only provides a very few options of pavers and patterns, and creating anything other than a rectangular patio is almost impossible. Big Hammer support admitted the problems, but offered no solution or help."
4,Order 1 size up,"These slippers come a bit on the small side, so order a little larger than you ordinarily would. They are snugger up front and a bit loose in the back. Other than the sizing issue, these are quite nice."
3,Not really 3E.,I wear a 9EE but only 9EEE were available. These EEE are not truly EEE so know that when you buy them. I only hope they streach out some.
3,Not LLBean Quality but Best I could find for the size needed,This is to be a gift so I will have to review again later about what the recipient thinks. I bought the 15 EEE slipper with Terry Lining. It looks wonderful and having a shoe size and width that large is why it got 3 stars ( I would have gave it 3.5). The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is a large seem inside where the toes will push against that it is uncomfortable. I will let the recipient decide if the seam is a deal breaker as he has been looking forward to having a comfy pair of slippers for a few years and even though I've asked LL Bean to increase their size and width on slippers - sadly I must be the only gal with men who have large feet in her family as they said not enough requests have been made so we we are stuck with a less than steller pair of slippers.
2,Nice but didn't last that long.,"Bought size 11 and my tennis shoe size is 10.5/11. Fit snug, specially with socks, but loosened up to ideal fairly quick. The large brand tag seam is placed right under the heel and is mildly irritating. I went with the terry as the sheepskin retained too much heat and made my feet sweat, thus not pleasant smelling. After about 4 weeks the memory foam was permanently squished and started getting a sticky sensation under the balls of my feet. Now 8 months in, the terry lining has fallen apart everywhere. Doesn't smell though :). The leather and soles look near new. Wish I could replace the insides and get continued use from them.My previous moccasins were a Mervin's store brand, sheepskin lined and same price but lasted years, making this pair actually 5x costlier. Should also mention I weigh 180 lbs, so normal healthy adult male shoe stresses."
3,Sized too small. Order at least 1 size larger for correct fit.,"I wear a size 11 in every shoe I own, but when these arrived they were way too small. Shoebuy's Customer Service was great and I returned them without a hassle. Leather in the slipper seemed very stiff and did not appear to me to be of good quality. I went back to LL Bean."
2,Poor construction = Bad durability,Not a bad pair of slippers in terms of comfort but unfortunately the bad quality led to the upper peeling away from the sole in less than a year. I would not recommend to anyone wanting a decent and lasting pair of slippers.
2,PWPalmer,The slippers were the widest offered but still were too tight for my wide feet. I also had to pay the shipping charges when I returned them.
1,bad product,When unable to buy a replacement for the previous slippers (tamarac)from amazon i purchased a different brand (these)they were ok at first but gradually became uncomfrortable to wear.
2,Chuck,The slipper seems to have some craftmenship. In my case they seem to run about a half size small. Who wants to wait for a pair of slippers to stretch? I wish I had known this in advance ... they look good in my closet though!
4,"Comfortable, warm and sturdy","I'm pretty happy with these slippers. They replaced a pair of another brand that I wasn't happy with. The laces on the others were really cheap and were splitting apart. These seem to made from a solid piece of leather, so I don't expect a problem. Also, on my old pair the uppers and soles were glued together, and were splitting apart. These have the uppers stitched solidly to the soles. The only drawback so far was the packaging - way too much waste. Also, they seem so warm that I doubt I'll be able to wear them in the summer, but I won't find that out for a couple of months (I'm from New England)."
2,This slipper is not a EEE width,I liked the slipper look but the EEE size was anything but wide. This slipper should be sold as a regular width.
3,Sized smaller than normal,These shoes appear to be well made.They are sized small.I originally ordered a size 9D. They were way to tight so I paid the return postage and ordered the 9EEE.They are also tight but I'm hoping they stretch out.
4,"Comfortable, both indoors and out","For me, comfortable shoes are a must, and these L.B. Evans Yukon terry cloth lined slippers are superb, comfortable enough to wear around the house but sturdy enough for street wear. They look good, too."
2,Sizes Run Small,"First I thought these were great slippers, look great & well made.BEWARE they run small. I always wear a size 10 1/2 so I thought an 11 would be perfect seeing there are no half sizes. My toes touched the front of the slipper. Amazon will not pay return shipping because the problem wasn't their fault!!"
1,Cheapest quality ever,These slippers started to fall apart 5 days after putting them on! The leather is too soft and thin and the laces cut right through it. Do NOT buy these.
3,LB Evans Yukon Moccasin,"These shoes run a bit short. Shoes of equal quality can be purchased cheaper in sizes through 12; however, my reason for buying these shoes was to get the larger size (15), and I was disappointed to find them short. I would have returned them, and ordered a size 16, but I had paid postage for shipping, (about $9) and would have had to pay that again for returning them. Then, if I reordered, I would have had to pay $9 for the third time! Sorry, but that is a little too much when added to the price of shoes, and there was no guarantee that the second pair would be a good fit."
4,Wide slipper,I ordered these for my son who has very wide feet and arthritis in his feet. They did fit him and are comfortable.
3,construction,"would like a wider product as one came apart on the side, although this was the one with the most room as other foot is larger"
3,Should Have Been Condensed to a Short Article!,"The focus of this book is on the first 300 years of Christianity. The first Christian century in Roman Palestine was a time of class division, oppression, hatred, and war - like the American 1960s. Ehrman argues that Peter, Paul and Mary Magdalene were apocalyptic thinkers believing that the end of all things would be like the beginning - a return to the sinless Garden of Eden. However, it is difficult to give strong credulity to the tales of oral cultures, such as the time of these three, because such people changed their songs and stories depending on their own feelings and emotions, the political context, etc. Sometimes they were just made up from the start.Ehrman also tells us the stories of miracles enacted by these three probably are not true. He also does not place any credibility in stories that Mary Magdalene was Jesus' sexual partner or a former prostitute - these legends occured considerably later in their historical records."
5,Beyond Expectations,"I have read five of Ehrman's works of Biblical history. I am a professional historian, though not a historian of religion. The overall excellence of this body of work is remarkable. That he should create ""biographies"" of three first centry figures is astonishing enough, but that they should be as persuasive as these efforts are is a reward to any serious reader. Serious but not boring."
2,and what did I learn ...,"Yep we get it, its hard to figure out exactly what happened 2000 years ago. So why write a book about it?Sorry Prof., I've got to think your classes are snoozers not shockers. (but then I don't live in the bible belt.}"
1,C'mon,"BE has written another volume based on his particualr point of view. Is he an historian? Does that fact that he claims to be ""fair"" in his conculsion be trusted. I think the answer is yes and no. I like his writing style but this book and others he has written has a taste of the ""Emergent"" view that seems to be the new demthylogizing of the 21st century. I like this book but find Barts ""agenda"" tedious."
4,Works just great for me,"I am not a real big computer guy. I have a pretty basic machine, and not a lot of money to buy a new one. A buddy recommended this to me, I bought and installed it, and it has worked just fine.It took a couple of restarts to really see a difference, and since I only have an old modem, the speed increase was pretty noticieable loading the webpagesAll in all, I think this product does just what it says."
4,Lilias is the best teacher out there.....,I grew up watching Lilias on TV(PBS) when she had a long braid.I purchased this video a while ago and I have since begun to use it. Yes!!! Lilias talks but thank god she is taking time to explain in full what your body should fell like. I have one other video by her but I hope to purchase more in the future. Her teaching style is for everybody....
3,"Sturdy machine, lackluster speakers","The machine works great, but the sound from the speakers is tinny. Use headphones for best sound."
2,Returned item due to recording quality,"I had high hopes after reading other reviews. I've recorded music using Sony tape recorders for over 30 years with fantastic results.... so expected similar quality. However, recordings of music from FM music stations turned out to be substandard, and recordings of guitar and piano practice were terrible. Considering that I would have needed to buy extras to run the recorder using electricity or to record in stereo, it wasn't worth keeping. Like others who reviewed this item, I was irritated by the lack of auto turn-off and lack of a counter. In its favor, the sound quality was good, but I was hoping to buy a stereo tape recorder for taping live music practice."
1,Panasonic RQ-A220 Cassette Player/Recorder,"Horrible piece of machine!!The rewinding motor is so weak, that it takes foreever to rewind, even using an AC adapter.If Panasonic keeps making garbage like this, no wonder SONY is taking over the electronis market!!"
4,Panasonic is Still the Best,"This recorder was purchased due to an early 80's model that just recently quit working. It would actually record what was playing on the radio with the same amount of quality you would get from a boombox. Anyway, I was not too suprised to see that Panasonic still makes a ""recording"" walkman. I know that name belongs to sony, but what else do you call them? This machine, unlike my older one, has external speakers that are suprisingly loud for such a small device. Additionally, it can record in 3x, so a 120 minute tape now lasts 360 minutes, or 3 hours on each side. I enjoy this feature for lectures, but it is not as good of quality for music as the 1x function. The only real drawback here is the station ""drift"". As you are listening to the radio, it will slowly move off of the station, and sometimes onto another one. I can't get it to stop. So if you are recording from the radio, you should babysit this one or else you will not record what you expected."
1,This book gives no credit to parents,"My son has started grade one this year and I am shocked at the lack of accountablility in education today. This book gives no credit to parents or educators that want to know what is going on in schools. Everyone knows that standardized test are not perfect and cannot meet all the needs of an education, but neither can any formal educational method.What are the alternatives??????This books argues against applying scientific methods to education.When I went to school, some years I had good teachers and tests and some years I had bad teachers and tests. With standardized testing at least there is an attempt to improve this. If the tests are no good, then they should be changed, not thrown out.Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater!"
2,Martini Lounge: Pottery Barn,"I was spoiled by hearing and acquiring DOWNTOWN LOUNGE & WINE BAR by Pottery Barn, before I purchased this CD. Totally disappointed;2-stars at best. Maybe in a noisy, crowded room where you just needed a little musical background noise, but not to really listen to in the comfort and privacy of your home. Just my opinion; might be the ""Cat's Meow"" for another."
2,its not that they say.,"it is a 2 stars just because arrived on time ,but this is not the same product ,that they sent me."
3,Does anybody have a rating on this?????,"Seems like this has been out a while, but i haven't seen one review on it. Anybody?"
1,Save your money,"I bought this from Amazon, using the information on the page, this is suppose to be a full length film. It is NOT. Its run time is 55 minutes, not 71 minutes.However that isn't the worst of it....it is letterboxed...suprising for a 1939 movie. I don't know how or what they tried to do to this, but the picture is distorted and unwatchable."
4,Tu Que Harias?,Real cool flick. Great acting and an outstanding soundtrack. Iv'e reccomended this film to many friends already.
3,isolated diary entries,"I was expecting this book to be more ""story-like""-- to flow from one woman's experience to another. Instead it's a series of short, isolated diary entries. Quite interesting, but there's no plot to follow. I would have preferred to read each woman's diary fully, rather than mini-entries of many women's diaries grouped by general topic (taking leave, matters domestic, etc.). Again though, it is interesting stuff. My personal preference would have been to group by woman rather than topic."
4,Canon Semi-Gloss,"This photo paper really is what works the best with our printer (Canon prixma).We have never been disappointed with the quality and the drying time is exceptionnal.The paper is thin and light, very smooth. We have yet to experience any jammed paper (which happened with Koday paper for some reason)We have printed 8x11 and 4x6 pictures , color and black & white and the printed results are impressive."
5,Great Product,"The canon supplies for my Canon Pro9000 Mark II are of consistent quality. This company shipped immediately and the product arrived in prefect condition. By the way, this is an excellent printer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Hooked,"I got a great deal on theCanon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer (3295B002)and ordered this paper. My very first print, immediately after installing the printer was on this paper.It is great! The print matches what's on my screen, the colors are vibrant and clear. The material is resistant to fingerprints (once dry).Wonderful product - well worth the price of admission!"
5,Works beautifully,Works beautifully especially with Canon photo printer. My Canon photo printer does not give natural skin tones on non-Canon paper. But with this paper I am very pleased with the results!
5,Great product,My favorite photo paper at a reasonable price. Will order again and again..thanks for the exceptionally quick service during the holiday season.
5,Canon Photo Paper Plus Semi-gloss,I have a Canon Pro9500 printer which is a pigmented inkjet printer. It works wonderfully with this paper using the canon PPPSG profile that comes with the printer. It falls between a glossy and matte finish and provides for beautiful contrast in the finished product as well as excellent color rendition.
2,You Can Get This From The Canon Store For Dirt CHeap,This paper is the exact same thing as Ilford's Smooth Gloss. No Im not kidding. I mean its like basically 100% eactly the same results. The only difference is canon puts their stupid name all over the back of the paper. They are probably made by the same manufacturer. You can buy this paper (which lemme say once again is the same thing as Ilfords Smooth Gloss paper) on the Canon website in bulk by the hundreds for like $5-$6 per 200-240 sheets.. No Im not joking. Its on sale. 2 stars because the price just SUCKS really bad..its a rip off at this price.
4,Exactly the finish we were looking for,"We wanted to print to finish like what you would get from a school picture photographer and this was it. Definitely not glossy, but one step above white paper matt finish."
4,Substitute Product was acceptable.,"what I really wanted was Legal size glossy photo paper. I purchased this semi-gloss and cut it down.The shipping was prompt, and the print quality was quite acceptable, although just a semi-gloss."
5,Works well with my Canon Printer,"This paper works nicely in my Canon printer. I prefer the semi-gloss to matte or high gloss, but thats really just a personal preference. I'm not a professional, I just print photos to have around the house, and I'm happy with this paper."
4,Looks Nice.,When I ordered this I didn't pay that much attention to the size. So I could not get this to work in my printer as it needed to be the longer paper I mean it is a beautiful paper but was just the wrong size for me. Since it is too short once the printer kicks it out it messes up the color at bottom.
2,Smears easily,"Bought this to make repos of pictures I have on my computer of family and friends, when I printed out a picture it smeared the ink and didn't hold the color. Figuered it was a canon product and so isn't my printer, guess they just are not compatible"
4,Great product,Worked really great in minutes. Can view my own CD's DVDs as well as the rented ones!!
1,Film Critics Version,"This is the kind of biography you get when a film critic writes it. The amount of Johnny Depp information could fill one chapter with the rest of the book being one loooong review of his movies and movies that affected him. If you are a fan of the movie genre, this book might fit BUT if you are a fan of Johnny Depp; - stay clear!!"
2,disappointing,"I found A&E documentary on the Lewis & Clark voyage of discovery a weak effort, considering the technology and resources at their disposal. Although the naration does present many facts, the visuals are disappointing--too many black & white ore sepia toned images. The corps' contribution to botony and zoology of North America barely mentioned. After reading Ambrose's account of the journey I was expecting much more footage of the wildlife of the plains and mountains in the video. In fact the flora and fauna of the continent are hardly mentioned. The video does a good job of describing the Corps' relations with the Native American peoples and uses Catliln's images of the Plains Indian to illustrate this aspect of the voyage of discovery."
4,Lewis and Clark DVD,Great product! Really enjoyed sharing it with my class! This DVD came on time and in great condition! Thank you!
5,Computational Linguistics,"If you have a limited bookshelf space and a limited budget, but love to have a good study and reference book on Computational Linguistics, than this is the one to have. The subject is treated in girth and in depth. The 500-page content is well structured and very well written. The author has divided the content into four parts (mentioned in Preface) Theory of Language, Theory of Grammar, Morphology and Syntax, Semantics and Pragmatics. I have hard time putting this book down since the time it arrived in the mail a few weeks ago."
2,wrestle,"Hot, nude men in different wrestling holds. If you wanted something more than just wrestling don't buy this dvd.But if you like guy rolling around on the floor this ones for you."
3,Nicely complements Best of Eddy Raven,"Having grown up hearing Eddy Raven on the radio, I wanted to buy on CD such hits as ""I Could Use Another You,"" ""Never Too Old For Young Love"" & ""Sometimes A Lady."" A disc titledThe Best of Eddy Ravenfailed to provide me the 1st 2, though it did contain the last. This disc, however, does contain the 1st 2, & both discs feature 4 other songs, including ""I Got Mexico"" & ""Right Hand Man."" Now that I own this disc, I have 16 different songs by Eddy Raven, though paying twice for 4 of them was a bummer. Oh well, maybe someday a compilation with more than just 10 songs will come out."
2,Delivered in poor condition,"The dollhouse was very disappointing. It arrived with scratches, chips, dirt marks and some of the edges peeling. It is such a pity because I would not hesitate to recommend the dollhouse if the supplier could be trusted to deliver a product that did not appear to of been either used or left in storage for many years. It is reasonably well made, easy to put together and it has a lot of furniture. You can not do better for $90. So why didn't they send a set untouched, straight from the manufacture?"
2,Iron out toilet bowl cleaner !,"I installed the product as directed and up to this point I can't see much if any benefit, still iron stains occuring in bowl."
2,Can't really tell a difference,I really gt this because we have hard water and my toilet was having a hard time flushing. This product hasn't made a difference but I also don't think it was the right product for the job.
3,Not everything is included,"OK...the mount is fine, BUT it does NOT include the adapter plate needed to attach the mount to the TV! The picture on the product page shows an adapter plate already attached to the mount. And Ritz does not carry adapter plates.One solution is to go to the peerless website and see which specific adapter plate you need and that look for a place that sells it. Or better yet, buy a mount that comes with everything needed to mount your big screen."
3,Take the Money and Run!,"Quick Glance: Entertaining; Humorous; Great Regional BookJeff Diamant provides an insider's view of the infamous Loomis Fargo theft of October 4, 1997. Diamant keeps it interesting by taking readers into the mobile homes and gated communities to meet the unusual suspects behind the crime. Those readers in the Charlotte, NC region will recognize all the local spots used by the likeable looters for clandestine meetings, money laundering, and luxurious hideouts. A good read if you're looking for a comical, sometimes hilarious true crime story."
2,A letdown,"With due respect to the author, I thought this book was a bore. Given the story -- several knuckleheads rob Loomis Fargo of $15 million without giving any thought to keeping a low profile afterward -- I figured I'd be in for a rollicking fun read. I was wrong. The narrative is dull, the plot, albeit true, is tedious, and the occasional attempts the author makes to compare the crime with other infamous heists are sorely lacking in detail. Wait for the movie."
2,Image different than described,I thought that this image of the footprint of the Buddha would be a full 17x22 but I was wrong. On the poster the actual image of the footprints of the Buddha in the center measures around 12x17 and is surrounded by a hideous 2 to 3 inch thick orange border all around. The actual measurements of the poster is 15x22. On the bottom part of the orange border are some words written in what looks to be Tibetan and Sanskrit.This poster is not what I thought it would be and I would send it back but don't want to go through the hassle. I will just have to cut off the hideous orange borders and find a smaller frame.
5,Excellent 6 book series,David Wiltse writes a wonderful 6 book series about John Becker. I'd love to see him expand on the series
4,PROGBIGGINNER,I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THIS CD.MAYBE I'LL JUST KEEP LISTENING TOIT AND IT'LL GROW ON ME.IT DOES HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD MOMENTS.I GUESS I LIKE THE HEAVIER SIDE OF PROG.DON'T GET ME WRONG THIS IS A FINE CD THOUGH.MAYBE JUST NOT QUITE MY STYLE.
