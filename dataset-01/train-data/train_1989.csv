3,The World Book Dictionary,This book was a little long. I tried to read it to improve my vocabulary. It did improve my vocabulary. People thought I had gone back to school again.
4,Robert Bartley has written a fine economic analysis.,"I agree with a previous review in that your synopsis of ""The Seven Fat Years"" assumes that the 1980s were a ""decade of greed and heartlessness"", a completely unsubstantiated assumption. It is incomprehensible to me that an intelligent reviewer could assert this. Bartley, as editor of perhaps the finest newspaper of its kind in the world, has done readers with an historical interest in this period a service, that is he has presented an accurate appraisal of the 1980s. For those interested in ""supply side theory"", this text should serve as a primer. The Reagan presidency, coming after the drift of the Carter years, was a period of economic and historical dynamism without parallel in our history. Read Bartley and find out!"
5,Fungus The Bogeyman the Plop up book,"My 10 year old wanted this book as her teacher has owned her copy for 20 years. We were unable to purchase the plop up version anywhere in NEW ZEALAND, so I tried purchasing thru Amazon for the 1st time and was THRILLED at the super fast service, it arrived in under a week, and the book was exactly as stated. My daughter is absolutely thrilled to own her very own copy and it is a treasured item to pass on to many generations. I will definately use Amazon again. Cheers (ps: the book is well written, illustrated and funny a great read)."
4,Scooch are pure pop,"This song does for Scooch what the song, ""One for sorrow"" did for Steps (if you haven't heard them then you are missing out). It starts off like a love song with haunting piano chords in the background and works up to a thumping beat. This song is pure pop at it's best. It is about somebody who is hiding their feelings but their eyes are saying, ""more than I needed to know"". The writers of the song are famous English pop writers Stock and Aitken who put together some of Kylie Minogue's hits. There is not a lot of unpretentious pop about, so Scooch are a breath of fresh air. Check them out now."
3,Not bad,"As pop music goes, it isn't half bad. I like Scooch because their voices really work well with each other and this song is a great song. However, it's not pop at it's best. Their are other songs on the album that sound better and more pop-like."
1,2 Yr Replacement for sml appliances,"On 7 Sept I ordered the replacement contract for an iRobot Rumba vacuum cleaner (149.99). Received confirmation of the order and that it would be shipped between 11 and 16 Sept. After I stated to Amazon that I had not received the contract, I was e-mailed by Service contracts by New and given a customer service number on 23 Sept. I called this number on 24 Sept and was assured that a contract would be mailed. I have not received any contract."
3,Underwhelmed,"If you haven't read everything by James W. Hall, Randy Wayne White, and John D. MacDonald , go ahead and do that first. I can never put those books down. Bone Key is alright I guess, but it's characters never intrigue me or even make sense like these other author's do. Standiford writes about women like a 14 year-old-boy would. I also couldn't figure out what Deal's motivation was for most of what he did. Give me Thorn, Doc Ford, or Travis McGee any day."
5,This book saved my life!,"My wife got me this book as a present, and to say the least, I am no handy man. I am proud to say I now am! This book was super clear, and the designs had interesting projects that we could really use. I really recommend this book to anyone, with or without building experience."
4,Complete and informative,I'm a novice woodworker and checked out a dozen books from the library on the subject. This is the one I'm going to purchase - by far the best of the lot.
5,Great CD!,"This CD is really good if you are looking for a drumming recording. I was looking for a CD that focused on drumming and rhythms because I wanted to practice my Zulu dances. The problem with this CD is that it only gives you the titles and the song lengths, but no artists' names, and NO countries of origin. I am sure the majority of music on this CD is not Zulu but probably originates from somewhere further north, e.g. Senegal, Ghana. But overall, for lack of any other recordings it satisfied my need at the time."
4,good and simple,This compelation is full of superb performances of traditional afro-percusion without an overproduced sound. Can be very helpful for percussionists who are looking for good examples to play by.
5,Daughter Loves It - TJ's Speaking NOT An Issue,"I value opinions from child professionals, being a child psychologist myself, but sometimes we can take things a bit too seriously. My 4-year-old daughter LOVES this toy and she does not seem to mind the ""w""/""r"" switch. I do not believe that her future college and career potential will be overly impacted by her use of this cute toy! This toy was definately the winner out of all of my daughter's toys this Christmas. Based on her frequent use, I may need to stock up on D-size batteries..."
4,What speech impediment???,"I think the problem may be in a certain speech-language pathologist's hearing. Listen for yourself on this site. The bear enunciates better than my husband! (Sorry honey) He changes his voice as he reads the story, but neither my sister or I could detect this ""speech impediment"".It's a cute toy and reminds me of a modern, cuter version of Teddy Ruxpin.I, too, am not fond of modeling improper speech to children, for the sake of entertainment-which is a non-issue in this case. We are excited to give this to our niece this Christmas."
4,"Can be creepy, but good with the lights on.","My son got this for Christmas last year, he was 3 1/2 at the time. He was so intrigued by the talking bear, for a little while. Then, one day I went in his room and found TJ facing the wall so I turned him around. Next day, same thing. Then my son would ask me to put on a story, but demand I took him away as soon as the story was over. I must agree this bear can be a little creepy, but it still saves me from reading stories every night. Also, the animatronic motion makes a louder noise than I expected although I would still recommend it."
5,tj bearytale is a toy for the child who love books,My 3yr old loves TJ. He is a really great toy. He really loves the songs. He love to be read to and I can't always read to him when he wants so TJ reads to him. I would recommend this toy to anyone who has a child who love to be read to. It is a fun way introduce your child to the wonderful world of books. He has wonderful sound effects that really make stories come to life.
5,begging not to quit making toy,"The liitle boy(8 years old) we bought TJ for has cerebal palsy. It is one of the only toys that he absolutley loves and can calm him down. We have bought a total of 13 TJ's and we have had 2 replaced and we sent 4 back to playskool that were replaced with a different toy. Thanks so much for having TJ for us to buy.Thanks,Miranda Allison"
4,OK,"I think this toy is OK, I did find the speach thing a little annoying, but overall it is an OK toy. My 2.5 yr old does try to move or hold the toy when it is talking and I am a bit worried about it getting broken arms. Stories are cute, my little one isn't entirely sure about it yet."
5,A Magical Christmas,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He is 2 1/2. He was mesmerized all day. He kept pushing the button over and over so he could hear the story. By the end of the day he was holding the book and trying to read a long. I was very impressed and would recommend T.J. Bearytales to any one who would like to introduce a child to the magical world of reading.
4,An inspired collection of Irish Rebel songs,"Good CD, some slow, some faster more energetic songs. No idea who the artist is, but for 5 bucks the cd's worth it if you like traditional irish rebel ballads, etc."
3,"For the price, it is worth it...","The singers are unidentified, and most of the voices are not the smoothest you could find, but these certainly ARE songs connected with various Irish rebellions, unlike the comments from a prior reviewer. I have been listening to this kind of music for more than 40 years, having been hooked on it by The Clancy Brothers, who for my dough still have the best renditions available on CD. I found this in a bargain bin for even less than the price listed here, and the nice thing for me is that four or five of these songs I never heard before, although I thought I must have heard or owned every one made over the decades. The Clancys and The Dubliners and the Wolftones are more musically pleasing, but this item is not a waste of six bucks if you really like the style and era and subject matter."
2,Its ok,"The songs are very good but the singer is a bit naff. Soldiers song is only an instrumental which is cack cos its the best song on the album. Songs by the wolfetones are better and also the dubliners, i reccomend alive alive oh sung by the wolfetones, but take this aswell cos its cheap."
2,"Financial Stuff, not Business Modeling","I'll be honest, I haven't finished it yet. I've read 3 other books in the week since I started it since it is so boring with accounting stuff like cashflow, scorecard and other financial stuff. I would not buy it again, recommend it or even start it if I saw it. I'll probably finish it as a point of honor, but stick to the author's other works."
4,HOT SM guide to serviice,AT FIRST I WAS THINKING THIS IS NOT WORTH THE TIME BUT LIKE JAMIE I FOUND THAT THERE IS MORE TO MR BENSON
3,Kin Ping Meh - 'No. 2' (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1972, as this was the second effort by Germany's Kin Ping Meh. Nothing to get all that excited about - but okay from this '70's heavy progressive collective. Worthy tracks would be their so-so Beatles cover ""Come Together"", ""Together Jam"" and the eight-minute ""Liveable Ways"" (reminds me of Uriah Heep). Plus Repertoire gives you two added bonus cuts - the single edit of ""Sometime"" and ""Sunday Morning Eve"". Not a bad CD reissue. Saw that this 'No.2' album was produced by Achim Reicel and Frank Dostol [who's also worked with The Rattles, Joy and Baccara]."
3,what should i say?,i really wanted to like this... unfortunately i didnt =(and some suff that they missed too... some mistakes at the end... not one of the best
3,"Not George Romero, but respectably scary","First, I'm a grandmother, and I saw this with my 72 yr old mom. It was her choice. I wanted to see Over the Hedge. And I haven't willingly seen a wrestling match since Bruno Samartino and Ivan Kowaltzki quit wrestling.We both love good horror/slasher films. I own all the Romero Zombie films on DVD. So, I'm not some sissy mary who wandered in unawares.See No Evil was a respectable first attempt. The effects were excellent, but what else can you expect from the WWE, the creator of the original live special effects? Yes, it was predictable. Yes, I kept hoping some of the 'good guys' would get killed [particularly 'Michael'. Now there was a man who needed killing]Overall, it was a matinee well spent. Just enough 'ewww' factor to make it interesting, and enough 'jump out and grab ya', even if you did know there was someone behind the wall/window/curtain."
1,See no scary,"I'm really getting bored of these movies where a bunch of 20 something losers get stuck in a creepy mansion and get hunted down. But wait! There's a twist ending! A twist that you pretty much figure out at the beginning of the movie. The killer guy, Cane, is not scary. You see him pull out someone's eyes. Ok. After the 10th time, it's not even creepy anymore. Why was he saving them anyway? And I couldn't care less about the people he's killing. A bunch of Abercrombie and Fitch models who I'm supposed to believe are criminals.Why don't they make a movie about Barbara Bush? Now that would be scary"
4,At least its not another crappy remake,"This movie is okay, Violent, Gruesome. Perfect for a slasher movie. Sort of like an 80s horror movie meets the concept of Psycho. For the same reason, i liked the movie Dead Silence, its original, not a remake. This isnt the best of movies. Rating slightly above average, I would still sugget this for any horror/slasher film lover. Its new and fresh in a world of The Hitcher remakes..."
3,Surprisingly not the worst movie ever....,"I've seen better acting, but I've also seen MUCH worse. I've sat through better story lines, but there's also some really terrible ones out there too. The effects aren't half bad, and Kane's dialog is as little as expected (I could only imagine a movie completely ruined by someone giving him a few lines in the script...). I'd basically label this movie as average. It may make for some entertainment while getting together with some drinking friends or wrestling fans. I'll say that I'm glad I didn't have to pay to watch it. I got some laughs out of it. Perhaps worth a rent."
5,impressed.,I don't know anything about wrestling or have any idea who Kane is but was definately suprised by this movie. You can tell that they didn't have that large of a budget for the movie but instead of the death scenes being gory and cheesy they kept them simple but very clever. This movie wasn't the scariest i've ever seen but was very well written and well thought out. Each death was different and impressive all the way up to the last screen shot of the movie.
3,I dont even like him as a wrestler,"Kane does make a good movie villian. The movie started off strong, then the rap music kind of killed it for me. A typical horror movie with a few cool deaths. If you like horror, i'd check it out. Its better then 20 of the dime a dozen cheaply made horror flicks you seen in video stores today."
3,Not too bad,"You don't need another synopsis, so I won't give you one. However, I will say, if you're looking for a spooky, solid, and fun style slasher, this film is for you. The budget was moderate, the cinematography was fair, and the acting wasn't half bad. It has a pretty good plot and I think it's worth a watch on a Friday night."
3,Norman Bates on Steroids,"A group of convicts are sent to an abandoned motel to fix it up. While there they are stalked and killed by a 7 foot psycho that likes to pull out their eyeballs and put them in a jar. It's okay. Kane only says two words in the whole movie, guess he wasn't great at memorizing lines."
1,Truly awful,"This is a wonderful and amazing movie full of wit and humor as long as you want to see a movie with a dog urinating into an empty eye socket. In fact, I respect the filmmakers that much more for not caving into some sort of pressure to use gore for the sake of gore in their dog urinating into the empty eye socket scene. The dog urinating in the empty eye socket is tastefully rendered and one of the best scenes of a dog urinating in an empty eye socket ever (excluding that dog urinating in the empty eye socket scene from The Breakfast Club which also has its fans.) For years, horror afficiendos have been clamoring for the quintessential scene of a dog urinating in an empty eye socket and now they have it.Unfortunately the rest of the movie does not live up to the high standards set by the dog urinating in the empty eye socket and you have to wait an awfully long time for that dog to urinate in the empty eye socket."
1,And the Winner IS.....,"Ladies and Gentlemen, you're looking at the winner of the 2007 Golden Raspberry Awards (aka Razzies) even this early on, I doubt that there's gonna be any movie more awful and stupid coming out this year to even compete with this one. When you have a hardcore porn director and a pro-wrestler teaming up, hey, it's hard to compete with that."
3,evil,well it reminds me dont recall but if im not m isatken it seened like u saw his penis when he was in a cageof hallowenn movie and friday the 13th i
4,Wrestling fan,While I am not into this type of thing personally my grandson and his mates enjoyed it immensely
1,"The reason the word ""retarded"" was invented","What's with all the good reviews for this movie? Are you people serious? Not to sound like a snob here, but hot damn! This movie takes everything that is good about movies and throws them out the window, after first defecating on them. A bunch of models get killed in a non-scary way by some big guy who wrestles men for a living, and is also non-scary. Calling this movie shallow would be an insult to shallow people and shallow pools everywhere. Also, I'm pretty sure this movie was about 13 minutes long, and almost every line spoken by the ""hot"" blonde chick was a lame cliche. I did like it when her cell phone was literally shoved down her throat, though. spoiler alert! Titanic was a scarier movie than this poopy."
3,"IS KINDA CHEZZY,BUT IS OK IN SOME PARTS","This flick,I liked the graphic seens & bit gore, But scrip & camera shots,was real fast pasting & corny!! Not bad killing seens , but scrip and cast was real AWFUL!!! Acting was worst of all!!!That kind of str8 to DVD flick, just rental worth, nothing more!!! C+"
1,"Cockroach Sex?? No, Please NO!","I am ashamed to admit I saw this movie, It is advertized as: Young teens from a correctional facility, terrorized buy mad slasher..First of all these Teens were more like in their 20's Early thirties..They are totally completely repulsive characters, that you cant wait for the next one to be done in...You feel no sympthy, or bonding with the characters. They are rude crude hardboiled, stab you in the back type personalities. The first few minutes of this trash begins with a very promising scene and realy grabs your attention, but that was only the first few minutes, after that, push the Stop Button and seek elswhere for a better movie becaue they dont get as bad as this one....OH, I frogot if your paying attention, there is abrief scene of to large Cockroaches having Sexual Intercourse...Palllleeezz No!"
1,Unable to watch because of Region Difference,Why wasn't this DVD listed as being unavailable to watch in Australia? Surely Amazon should advise whether DVDs are not viewable in the country where the purchase comes from.
3,Old School,"This is a typical 80's type of Slasher film. You have your killer(Kane), you give him a little back story in the way of flashbacks. Torturous childhood with huge doses of religion. In this case he is raised to believe that he is the hand of God to murder the evil. Then you throw in a bunch of sex upped, drug using beautiful teens into a place they can not easily get out of. These are kids in lock up that are cleaning up an old hotel to get time off of their sentences. Let loose the killer and have everyone make incredible dumb. This is a quick 80 minute or so movie that is more into the gore than trying to be scary. They should have released an unrated version for maximum blood. Overall it is just okay. As a fan of the slasher film, this one would just be a middle of the road entry. It's nice to see a film with a decent budget give a try a the genre in a serious way without any wisecracking villans, but there are way too many faults in this movie to make me rate it any higher."
2,all that gore still doesn't make the movie great,"Responding to a call, a cop investigate a house that turned out to be an earthly version of hell. Nearly killed, the cop puts a bullet into the monster of a serial killer. However, salvation comes with a price. The cop loses one of his hands.4 years later, the cop is now a guard of a juvie detention center. 8 teens are taken to a condemned hotel. In exchange of a reduced sentence, the teens must clean up the hotel to have it presentable when it becomes a shelter.Like the 10 little Indians, the teens start dying one by one. Killing them is Jacob Goodnight, the same killer that the cop thought he had killed 4 years earlier.Overall, simple and predictable and spiced with gore. Regardless, it was ho-hum."
3,okay,"This movie was a nice return to old fashioned slashers. The kills were really slick, good amounts of gore, and obviously you can't go wrong with Kane flinging his hook on a chain around as your killer.The characters are cliche, not fleshed out very much at all, but they're at least not entirely irritating like a lot of horror movie characters so that makes up for it.There's a little twist at the end, but it wasn't that exciting and just left me saying ""oh ok cool"" rather than actually experiencing any shock. I'm glad it was there anyway, I guess, but it didn't make much of a difference.Overall, it's a right down the middle slasher. Nothing to make it stand out as incredible, but it's decent and I'm glad I bought it anyway. It's a nice addition to a horror collection."
3,Paul (bloody),This movie See No Evil is a scary movie that has a lot of blood splatter in it. Kane stars in this movie as a well played murderer. Peaple get groomsely killed and get pain aflicted on them. Seeing people get killed this way makes it so realistic. Everyone is always on the edge of the seats. Scary movie fans would love this fantastic film.
5,awesome i loved it!,The movie starts off with gory events then it leaves you wonder what is going on and why is this character hacking people. A group of troubled teenagers get to stay in a rundown hotel to do community service that will hopefully take off for time they're serving. But little do they know they're is a killer in the hotel and one by one he begins to kill them. Great suspense and the plot was overall a great one.
4,Very beautiful,Charm is worth the sale price.Mine is 14k yellow gold.Circumference of charm itself is slightly less than that of a dime.there is a tiny hole drilled in back behind ea.diamond to let light through.A keeper. I gave it 4 stars b/c made in china
1,"LA MENCANCIA ESTA EL DORAL, POR RECHAZO DE TC, POR FAVOR VERIFICAR","ESTA CALIFICACION ES DEBIDO A QUE EL PAQUETE ESTA RETENIDO, ME INDICA QUE RECHAZAN CARGOS A LA TARJETA, VERIFICANDO MI ESTADO EL PRODUCTO ESTA DEBITADO DE LA MISMA."
2,Carolina Herrera - 212 Men,"I am a fan of Carolina Herrera's 212 fragrance for men. I usedto buy it on Maxis' stores. The smooth perfume used to last longerthan any other perfume. Unfortunately, the 212 fragrance I recentlybought via Amazon.com does not last as expected (by halfday the perfume is gone).Sergio"
4,Nice smell,"First of all, it's the first time i buy a perfume from amazon and i'm impressed, i got my order within 2 days, super fast, so thats why i'm buying all my perfumes here from now on. This perfume smells good, it's not too strong. I reccomend it."
5,Great cologne,"I buy this cologne for my husband every year. Sometimes he says that he wants to try something new, but I never let him. Why? Because 212 Men is incredibly sexy. He's been stopped by women and men alike to ask what scent he's wearing.If you're looking for a unique scent to try, don't hesitate to try 212 Men. Just be prepared to get some attention for it."
1,This is not original 212 by Carolina Herrera,I have used 212 by Carolina Herrera for many years. The one I receive is not original. I am trying to return it but I am getting a weird message that i should dispose hazardous materials properly.?What is that about?DO NOT BUY THIS IS NOT ORIGINAL.
1,Lousy persistance.,"The fragance is very nice, but it lasts very little.After a few hours, it can't be smelled. And I think I might be exagerating with ""a few hours"".More like less than an hour. I'm not kidding you. I don't know where Carolina Herrera got the other reviewers from, but I can't believe NONE commented on this!!What good is a perfume if it's persistence is SO bad???"
5,Great Stuff,"These guys are the real deal! Their music is a strongly New Orleans-flavored gumbo of up-tempo, horn-powered funk and soul. Great writing, great playing, great singing and harmonies. What more do you want? They deserve to hit it big. Their music is infused with much good humor and it is obvious they have a blast when they are playing. If you are into party music, you can't go wrong with King Johson."
1,Disappointing,This product does not smell or taste anything like frrrozen hot chocolate. It was a disappointing purchase!!
3,Not worth $6.95,"Smells nice but not worth the price. As a balm it is no better in terms of staying power than any cheap brand. In fact Carmex has greater staying power. If you want something that stays on and smells nice for 3.95ish try ""Lip Trip""."
3,OK product,Item is much bulkier than anticipated (made of much thicker plastic) but is exactly what it says it is and will work well for other craft projects.
3,not what I thought,While this book was not what I was looking for it did provide a first person account of one man's passing. If you're interested in this kind of thing then you might want to read this little book.
1,Worst money I ever spent,"TV worked great for about 4 months. The problems started with the DVD player. It stopped working. Then the TV started changing channels on its own and turning itself on and off. In the end the TV couldnt even stay plugged in. It would turn on and off continuosly so it was basically unusable. Now its just an $800 dollar paper weight. Phillips was absolutely no help since the TV only has a 90 day warranty. They offered me a new TV at a huge discount, $800 dollars!!!! Thats the same price i paid for it to begin with!! Check the internet for other reviews and you will see other people with the exact same problems in about the exact same timeline. I wish i did before i bought the TV. Why do you think there are so many refurbished models for sale???"
1,try something else,"this album really let me down, my high expectations being set by the faithless and the everything but the girl back to mine discs, which are excellent. there is no flow to the tracks, they are disjointed and barely, if at all mixed into one another. not good for relaxing to. maybe interesting if you're a morcheeba freak and want to know what they listen to, but as a continuous album, it seems like very little thought was put into compiling the songs.try everything but the girl or faithless back to mine discs if you want an album for some nice evening, dinner with a date, etc... music."
4,this is really good,"love this cd by morcheeba. the people who gave it bad reviews should clean their ears out and get their narrow minded heads out of their own anus. by the way the annette peackock song hated by one of the clowns who reviewed this is very cool. the two best and most diverse cd's in the back to mine series, this one and the new order one are the ones that always get bashed by the ignorant amazon reviewers. i say, ignore the rest of the series and pick up the aforementioned two."
3,Just to clarify the title,"Just to let everyone know, none of the songs on this album or done my Morcheeba. ""Back to Mine"" is just a series that gives artists like Faithless, EBTG, and Nick Warren the chance to release a chill-out album of previously released music that has inspired them. It's a good series, although I wouldn't say this album is worth it. it all depends on if you like Morcheeba's selection, which doesn't seem to reflect their own music all that much."
1,What a rip-off!,"The CD is clearly labeled with Morcheeba as the artist. But it's a compilation, and Morcheeba does not even appear! Even worse, the songs are a random mish-mash of styles. Only two are even worth listening to."
1,Back to the supermarket,"A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?). The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: ""paper or plastic?"""
4,4.5 stars...,"This is a pretty cool mix. I like the Back to Mine series because they put stuff on here that shouldn't go together. It's like a mix tape of songs you actually like rather than trying to put together a mix tape that has a certain logic to it.It's a bit different than some of the other Back to Mine mixes (Nick Warren's mega chill mix and Danny Tenaglia's sounding a lot like the 70s mix come to mind) but it's pretty cool.It's an odd, eclectic and pretty funky mishmash of stuff you'd be hard pressed to find in one place. The only reason I give this less than five stars is the hip hop tune towards the end. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I'm just not feeling it here. There's a laid back, trippy kind of feel to the whole thing and it throws a kink in it. If I could excise this little ditty I'd give it five stars. But it doesn't kill it.Don't go looking for Morcheeba. Just open your mind, sit back and chill a while."
1,back to mine,"I bought the CD before any real info was out on the CD, assuming it was new work by Morcheeba, only to learn it is a compilation of what they like - which would not be reason enough for me to buy it. Next time, I'll wait to get all the CD info before ordering."
2,not so good,"i haven't given it a true listen through yet, but even after i do i'm sure it won't live up to my expectations set by the faithless and the everything but the girl back to mine discs. it's far too disjointed, the tracks aren't mixed well, if at all, it's just not something to relax to or listen to as background music. this maybe interesting if you're a morcheeba freak and want to know what other types of music they listen to. it seems that little thought was put into this compilation, this cd should have been much better.try the faithless and the everything but the girl btm cd's. much much better."
4,back to mine collection,"for those uninformed listeners, back to mine is a series in which artists select songs that have influenced them (theoretically) and compile them into an album. This is not an album of original music."
3,Hidden Mento Gem,"Despite the packaging(no liner notes or artist names) this is a good collection of original Jamaican Mento tracks. Pre-dating ska, mento is a combination of Jamaican folk songs, African hand drumming and other island rhythms. The songs usually feature banjo, bongos, pan whistles, vocals and sometimes saxophone. This collection was probably made as a hotel gift shop item has amazingly good sound on the tracks which appear to be mastered from records and not from tapes."
2,"No, try something else...","I thought the music was somewhat fun to listen to the first time around, but I'm not attached to any of the songs. I wouldn't listen to any of it again save one song, Jamaican Mambo. I typically like world music, so I was somewhat disappointed.There are 12 tracks, which isn't bad. The quality isn't very good, but not terrible.I would look somewhere else for Jamaican music."
3,Only Okay,"This stacker sticks together easily because of the magnets, but does not stack easily because it's always top heavy, and falls over. Would not recommend as a stacking toy."
3,"I was estatic when I saw them, but not when I recieved them.","The rubbery antanne is wonderful to chew and they are very bright, with durable plastic. I can't forsee my child breaking them.The problem is with me.I oviously over loooked the part of them being ""magnetic"".Where is the fun in that?The magnets are so strong you can pick them up when all of them are connected!They will suffice untill I find other non-magnetic stackers."
4,not bad,"All six stacked up is very unstable, but less seems to work better. Better than some toys, worse than others."
2,Cute but useless,"I've had these stackers since my son was about a month old - I saw them and fell in love with them and figured maybe he would too. He's 9 months now. I've tried him with them several times throughout his life.They're cute, but they're just hard, awkwardly shaped bits of plastic. They're awkward for him to hold, and there's not much for him to do with them. He'll chew on them for a few minutes but then toss them aside.They rattle, but you have to shake pretty hard to hear the rattle. They stack, but there's not much fun in them - they just stick together.I'd recommend finding something a little softer and easier to grasp."
4,Very nice MFP,"After much review we chose the Brother over the HP and Lexmark. Having seen several HPs. I could not believe how quite and fast the Brother is. It beats the HP hands down. And we considered the HP to be the standard to measure printers by. The one thing that I have had an issue with is that in our office we use Lotus Notes for our email. The ""Scan to email"" function is not supported for Lotus Notes. When I phoned tech support, they acted as if Notes did not exist. In checking, Notes owns better than 50% of the corporate email market. We got it to work, but no thanks to Brother tech support. Hopefully we do not need them for anything else."
4,An excellent filter for beginniners!,"This moon filter is a great way to explore the moon for beginniners! This filter can reduce the glare of the bright moon so you can explore the moon easily. But for experts I would recommend to get a Orion Poliarzing Filter (...). This is because somtimes the moon is too dark. With a poliarzing filter, you can adjust the filter from 1-40%. For beginniners, I would strongly recommened this filter, but for experts, I would get a Poliarzing filter."
5,Does exactly what you expect it to do,"If you've dealt with Orion in the past, you expect quality optics, that are functional without being terribly overpriced. Such is the case with their moon filter as well.You don't need this filter on smaller phases of the moon, but as the moon approaches full, and gets increasingly brighter, adding this filter will greatly enhance the views by taking the edge off the glare so the details are clearer."
5,Excellent filter,Makes viewing the moon much easier on the eyes. A definite for those interested in scanning the moon.
3,This was a present,"This was a gift to someone, so I have no personal review, but when I asked about it later that week it was a well appreciated gift."
3,"1.25"" Orion Moon Filter","This 1.25"" Orion 13% Transmission Moon Filter really helps when viewing the moon. This was recommended when I purchased the Orion Skyquest XT8i telescope. However, the threads on the filter do not match up with the threads on the telescope eyepieces, which means that the filter will fall out when pointing the scope in a more vertical angle."
5,Great addition to our telescope,"Quick shipping, fits perfectly and enhanced the viewing capability of our telescope! I would highly recommend this item to any one considering viewing the moon"
3,"Excellent, but doesn't review all significant verses of Bible","Excellent commentary and articles. However, it does not include specific remarks on all chapters of the bible. In particular, although there are references to Deuteuro Isaiah in earlier discussion, there are no specific explanations of Isaiah Chapters 43-66. Since I bought this book partly specifically for clarification on some of these verses, I am disppointed."
3,is Lot Abraham's brother??,"Fairly good but not trustworthy enoughA couple of examples.It says about 8:20 - ""..this sacrifice inaugurates a new era in which the slaughter of animals was permitted."" (p.47)hmm.. what about Abel's ""fat portions""?""Abraham, his wife Sarai (Sarah), and his brother Lot"" ( p.48)hmm.. the text says ""Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot, son of Haran"""
3,The Oxford Bible Commentary ISBN 9780198755005 (Hbk.),"The 11 maps are not in a seperate part "" between pages 1346 - 1347 "" as indicated in List of Maps. Instead, they are together inserted in "" Bibliographical Guide to Bible Studies "" part, between pages 1342 -1343."
5,A good companion to the Bible,This book is a gold mine if you have interest in the Bible. It is very helpful with understanding specific scriptures and learning about the people of it's time.
3,"Impressive scholarship, uneven results.","Here's the problem with liberal scholarship for the conservative student: you're not going in looking for theological enlightenment, because liberal scholars tend to devalue the objective truth value of the documents. So what's left in terms of value is to understand the liberal theories, explanations, etc. That said, a one-volume commentary isn't always sufficient for this.The people who contributed to this represent a pretty good piece of liberal Christian intelligensia. And I'm not saying the book isn't useful - it is. It's just that I find it most useful as a tool for understanding how the other half thinks, and to that end, it's not deep enough. Still worth having in your library, I guess."
1,"Concise, Very Concise","If you want a very short overview of some (not all) Bible verses, this is for you. If you desire a fundamental commentary that goes out of its way to be ""religiously correct,"" this one's for you. If you need a commentary geared more toward simplistic, short, opinionated comments nearly devoid of scholarship, this one is for you."
5,DROIDIKA,"A great toy, you can bend his legs, and take off his head, and for a lightsaber hit you can break him apart. I love the firing missle action, just push down on the enh on the rocket and it shoots out. I got my moneys worth out of this one!!"
2,Why? Why? Whyyyyy???,Why does hasbro waste time and money on this peice of junk? This is a re-release of the Ep.II Destroyer and it still stinks!Re-release the Ep.I one instead!Uhh.. how do the missles fire again?
2,Picture inaccurate - No TOSLINK cable included,I am not sure if this was intentional or not but the package did not include the TOSLINK fiber optic cable as pictured. The cable just included the VGA and RCA L/R connectors.The cable works and I have not had any issues. The construction is not great but does the job.
4,Works Fine. No Problems Yet.,"I've had it for about a month and logged...30-40 hours on it. No glitches, it's worked fine. There are, however, cheaper solutions."
3,not bad,I am currently working on JSR168 (java portlets) it has helped in some ways. Still doesn't have a good enough description for setting up your environment. If you are looking for a book with examples and some explanation its not a bad book to check out.
4,The Only Book on Standard Portlets,This is an excellent book. It seems to be the only book on the market that covers the JSR168 Portlet API in detail and has very good coverage. The book is full of good examples which can be downloaded from a companion site. I recommend it heartily.
5,AWESOME!!!!,"What a vibrant energetic CD this is. It's amazing to see the energy SP still have even years after their ""break up."" The song selection is great and it is nice to hear the live versions of some of these songs for the first time (at least for me) Many of them are even better than the original studio versions. I can't say enough good things about this album. It is solid, consistent, well produced and mixed, and I feel a step above the live material from Back and Forth 3&4 and Ain't It Dead Yet. Sorry there was no material from the Process, but my understanding this was for legal reasons. BRAP ON!"
4,Can't get enough of SP!,Excellent quality live recording. Must have for all SP fans. Hopefully we will have the chance to see them in the US in the future.
2,Nostalgic stuff,Listened to this CD ... and it sounds like a collection of old recordings. Similar to old temple songs.Has some value in the nostalgia it evokes.
1,Overpriced Trash,These things are horrible. They arrived scratched and the back rubber padding was torn as well. The holes in the legs were not completely stamped out so I had to use an electric drill to complete the hole. Fortunately I had a metal drill bit able to complete the task. The chair padding does not have pre-drilled screw holes so you either have to drill holes or hope for the best with a screwdriver. The back of the chair provides little to no support. Not at all worth the effort or the price. The legs do not have rubber feet so they can easily scratch wooden floors. They're going back.
4,Bar Stools,These are a good buy for the price. I searched everywhere and could not find any bar stools for less than this one with a back. They work great and were easy to put together.
4,good buy,"I ordered 2 sets of them. They came in time as stated by seller. Easy to assemble,with all parts included. They are sturdy and function well."
3,You get what you pay for.,"These stools are low cost (cheap) compared to other we looked at. They will work for us; but we would have ordered better quality if non on such a tight budget.They were packaged badly - watch for loose parts in box. The bolts really do strip easily. The lineup of the parts in a little off in each piece, making it hard to bolt together. They don't rock at all when you sit on them, but after putting stool together we notice that legs are uneven. They look OK and they will work, but if yoyuu can spend morew & get better."
2,you get what you pay for,"The price for these were attractive, and they were pretty comfortable to sit on. However, within less than a year, the legs got bent out of shape (probably because we often leaned against the chairs as opposed to sitting directly on them) and the chairs became unstable. We're normal sized people and the chairs didn't last long. But if you're looking for a set of cheap bar stools these might fit the bill."
2,Definitely Made in CHINA...,"Thing falls apart VERY easily. The padded cushion part comes loose every so often. It's easy to put together though, and it stays up. I just hate that the cushion keeps coming loose! I would not buy these again."
1,Buyers Beware.....,THIS IS JUST FREAKING INCREDIBLE:Received wrong item....Placed order on 9/4/2012 it is now 9/26/2012 and still don't have my order.I hope you don't expect me to pay for this nonsense.Buyers beware...
4,Excellant Service,Very smooth transaction. I would purchase from this retailer again. I use 'Up Your Gas' to give me more energy when I workout but it is best not to take it after 2pm. RB
2,does not work!,"If you are looking to boost your energy. I don't think this product works. I bought a bottle and tried it out, however, did not find it helpful when taking it."
2,"The Flute may be Andean, but not the Music","The music samples are pretty accurate. It is played on Andean instruments, but the music is not really Andean - call it psuedo-Andean, like Joel Francisco Perri - if you liked him, you'll probably like this.REAL Andean music has a strict mathmatical integration, so that if you are familiar enough with it, you can tell how it will progress.This is just musical perfume for in the background, altho that's how some people use their music..."
4,If you like dogs and cozies you will like this book.,"Delilah Doolittle is a British lady living in Southern California, and trying to make a living as a pet detective. As she is working on finding an award-winning German shepard, she stumbles across a sinister conspiracy involving blackmail, shock collars, and even murder!As any cozy fan might predict, local law enforcement fails to take her seriously so she is forced to investigate the cases of missing dogs and murders on her own. With the help of a quirky best friend, a fellow Brit with a sketchy past, and her faithful dog Watson, Delilah slowly unravels the truth.This book is a pretty typical cozy, but some of the dialogue is snappy and the human and canine characters are appealing enough to hook dog lovers."
3,So-So,I was in a rush to a book store and only had 10 min.. I was looking for a Laurien Berenson book(Love the series)But found this insted. It was a good plot but she went throgh it too fast.
4,Lady sleuth and neurotic pooch solve a murder.,This book is great fun for dog lovers who like a good mystery.
4,A very good book from first-timer Patricia Guiver,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, only wish it was longer! Delilah Doolittle's personality reminds me of Amelia Peabody and Kinsey Milhone -- feisty, self-deprecating, a little too curious for her own good. Loved the ""English"" perspective on things, and the cast of eccentric characters. The dialogueis clever but natural, the descriptions of places and occurrences so detailed I can picture them easily. All in all, an excellent read for a firstbook. I look forward to many more."
1,lacks soul,I bought this CD after falling totally in love with The Road North which I literally played every day for 3 months. But this CD lacks soul. It has the feel of a recital. I am extremely disappointed.
3,a bit too pretty,"Alasdair Fraser began as a violinist, and you can hear it: his fiddling is smooth and lyrical, rather than rhythmically driven and danceable.On this album he presents primarily showpieces of the Scottish fiddle repetoir--his technique is impressive, and the tunes are clean and directly played. But he sounds like a violinist playing fiddle tunes. Simply put, this is listening music, not dance music."
2,Too Sweet For Me.,"I don't mind an occasional smooth, sweet fiddle tune but that's about all this is....even the upbeat tunes have no real feeling to them. Not a knee-slapper in the bunch and not all that Celtic sounding either."
1,This is a lousy piece of non-sense.,"Don't buy this book. It's just another feminist propaganda piece blowing its lesbian-gay horn with non-sense that nobody cares about. Boo hoo for them! ""Life is not fair."" Boo hoo!No wonder this book only has one favorable review. It's garbage. What a waste of paper."
4,Furuba is love.,"When I got this, I was a bit wary of bad dubbing- but as it turns out- the DVD's almost follow the manga's exactly! That pleased me to no extent, because a lot of dubs tend to ruin good animes.The animation, I think, is quite nice, simple shading and such but enjoyable.Overall, this is a great seris with an excellent plot. The end may leave you hanging, so purchase the next volumes of manga. ;D"
5,It does it's job as a feal good anime! :),"This anime is done very well, the story is cuddly but the characters have depth, which is hard to do. When I read the back of the DVD I immeadetly thought, ""Isn't this like 'Ranma 1/2'?"" But as your watching the show you can't make ANY Ranma 1/2 comparisons. The story is great! The director also did His and Her Circumstances another one of my favorite animes. I could find nothing wrong with this anime. WATCH IT :)!!!"
5,The Dub is as good as the Sub,"It's rare but the Dub(English) version is just as good as the Subtitled. This is a series that both genders can enjoy. It is shoujo and meant for girls but both genders are fans of this series. This is a series that deals with relationships in a very interesting way. The viewer along with Tohru will learn the querks of each of the Sohmas and why they are the way they are. As she learns about them, she learns about herself. Human interrelations can be difficult which is intensified by the Sohma curse. No matter how old or young you are, you may recognize the traits in the characters. The series is as nice as the intro song. This is a heartwarming series with a bit of a shocking end. But be warned, always have tissues available.Parents, this series is for the junior high age group and is particularly deft at dealing human interactions. If you want your child(ren) to be better thinking human beings, get this dvd or even better, the series."
5,This is great,"the movies and the books are the best, i liked them.those who like anime should buy the books or the movies.....there the greatest, ever.."
4,Very entertaining^_^,"A little bit about Fruits basket: Did you know that the creator was from CLAMP Cluster? Who's that you ask? CLAMP Cluster was a doujishi circle of 11 women. When they slpit up, 4 of them stayed togeather & formed CLAMP. Perhaps you can see Appapa Mokona's artistic influence on the creators design?About the relationships: The girl, you've gotta like her, but you gotta feel sorry for Cat & Rat, since they turn into animals is a girl's chest comes anywhere close. Also, Rat-kun is the object of desire of 2 men, so the series has BL. (for those of you who are STILL calling BL ""shounenai"", you REALLY need to stop. No one in Japan says it anymore)I reccomend watching it in Japanese with English Subtitles, as the dubers didn't exactly do the best job & making the voices fit the characters."
3,Not enough REPAIR info,"I was looking for info in repairing my roof. All I got was very simple "" clean it "" not much in depth."
3,Good to know stuff,"Everybody should have a manual for their trailer or motor home. This one covers a lot of problem solving maintenance you should do before you leave home to make it a pleasant journey in the RV. This is a good book, not a great book. It doesn't tell you how to fix your transmission, just when to get it to a mechanic who does. Well, that covers it well enough for me since I'm not a mechanic so I don't need to know more than this book tells me. Perfect for me."
3,A little too general,This book was OK but a lttle t TOO general for me. I would have liked more illistrations to show smaller parts in the appliances.
3,informative,"Solid collection of information. Wish it was just on travel trailers, since that's all I have. Overall though, a good guide to have."
5,trailer bible repair,I have a vintage trailer and purchased this book as a Bible. Great pictures and information. This book will give you an ideal what you might need for your vintage trailer. A must have.:O)
2,wand broke,"My cat loves this toy, however the wand has been breaking down and i have had it less than a month!"
3,My cat liked it but destroyed it right away,This toy entertained my cat but did not last for more than a day. Durability is lacking as is the case with many toys.
2,Not a useful travel guide,"Writing about the Greek Islands is not a simple matter of going there, taking some pictures, and drafting a brief description of the place. This is due in part to the unique nature of the Greek Islands, which are a very diverse and complex collection of locations, cultures, landscapes, and even climates. There are significant logistical concerns because getting to some of these islands can be tricky. And there's also the fact that, while some places cater to package tourists and are overrun with people during certain times of the year, others are far more remote and peaceful. Sadly, this book fails to capture any of these important themes, much less convey them in the kind of detail necessary to make a useful travel Guide. People headed for the Greek Islands should do some more research and find a better guide than this one. Your efforts will pay off in the form of a very enjoyable trip if you bring the right tools with you."
1,Crrrrrap,"The first day I used it I noticed that all that it did was BLOCK OUT some sounds instead of make them louder, so I got rid of it.I've seen stuff way better than that like the supersonic ear I'm going to be getting that."
1,HARMFUL!,"This toy would have been a blast for me, but it just had to have the no-volume-knob. Way too loud! Harmful to any child's ear. From a nearby cough to far away dish and fork clanking. OUCH! I'm almost certain, I don't know , but I do beleive I had a terrible ear ach after only five minutes of use. :("
1,Not one note of music,"What a disappointment! Why the author would thoroughly document the lyrics, while leaving his readers to make up a melody to these SONGS is beyond me."
4,Great show,I have seen this band twice live and this DVD is a nice way to relive those memories. The music is great and the film makes it fill like your right there. I would have liked to seen more shots of the crowd and the bar but overall I loved it!!
4,It stretches shoes,Nice sturdy wooden unit. You don't need to worry about breaking it. You would most likely pop the stitching on your shoes first. Great if you have one foot that swells
1,Not recommended,"I purchased the women's large, which should work b/c I am an exact women's 9. The shoe stretcher was way too large in length, width, height. Sure, it could stretch a sneaker, but why would I want to do that? It is completely unsuitable for a women's shoe, even if I did buy a smaller size (which is currently not available). To return it, you have to pay nearly half it's cost b/c of the item's weight."
2,too big,"i have a pair of 9.5 shoes, medium in width from Nine West. they are a little tight, so I bought this to stretch them out. It wont even fit into my shoe to stretch it out. This product is a waste of time. I will return it if I get a chance."
2,quality varies,"Size 0 is indicated for a size 9 but 00 is better for me. The first one I ordered worked well. The second one, a few years later, has cheaper hardware that does not work as well when stretching the shoe. Am returning my ""0"" for a ""00"" and hope I get one of the better ones. This is made overseas with apparently poor quality control."
5,It's good,"""Yes - Complete Deluxe Edition"" is great. It has pretty much nearly every Yes song you would want to play. Entire albums are represented. It's a huge, thick book. Some of the songs are fairly difficult, but what do you expect? It's Yes. And, the piano music appears to have been written in an attempt to cover piano, keyboard, vocals, and bass in a way that makes the song feel ""whole"". They did a really great job."
4,Great product,My original switch broke on my Polaris and had to find a suitable replacement. This one was afordable and seems to work so far.
5,Replacing a worn rocker switch,This newer version on my Warn rocker winch switch is to replace a worn out switch.These switches are exposed to the elements and do wear out.I recommend having a spare kept on hand.
3,Great photos but not enough country,"Rather disappointed with this coffee table book. Was looking for a collection of ideas and images of traditional Irish country ""peasant"" houses - as in thatched cottages - instead it was very heavy with upscale Anglo-Irish manor houses."
5,"Yet another stellar album from ""Da Man""","I agree with ""miss beesbottoms"" review of this album, partly because I to attended BUZZ for years, and its a shame they pushed it out of d.c and into maryland, BUZZ is #1 forever, now onto the cd, just like his previous work it is a great album. At first listen it didnt grab me right away but the second time was a charm cuz i fell in love with it like i expected. get this cd and u will see why its worth a rating of 5 stars.peace"
1,"blah, blah, blah...","This is seteotypical dull trance produced by one of the dullest old djs who has lost touch with his generation much less the next.. If you have a mind use it... challenge, have fun... stay away from this horrible piece of corprate BS..."
3,A must for serious fans of Azorean folclore.,"This CD features very old recordings, full of rare songs. I believe it is heavily influenced by Sao Miguel, but the island of Terciera gets in a few songs. Saudaude#4, which is really Saudade de Sao Miguel is a masterful instrumental reocording. Charamba is also a great instrumental. Don't expect great vocals or hi fidelity. It's pretty clear whoever recorded this in the early 1900's rounded up the nearby locals to perform. This does give it a very authentic feel. Look for the CD by Belaurora for better vocals, but somewhat less traditional arrangements. People unfamilar with Azorean folclore should look to Belaurora for something more accessible. However anyone found of world music old recordings will dig this. The best songs are not available as samples unfortunatly."
1,Bob Bag Bombs,The day we opened it we had to patch 3 times and still it didn't hold any air and my son never even got the opportunity to play with it. We threw it out the next day. Very disappointing!
5,Kids will love it,A lot of color that will atract our kid. He enjoy and pay attention on it.I am very satisfied with this product.
2,Baby doesn't really like this,"Our six month old baby doesn't really like this toy. I was hoping he would, but it doesn't hold his interest very much. It seems well made and I have no complaints with the toy itself, only that my baby prefers other toys over this one."
3,Octivity Time Baby Toy,"This toy is great in theory for textile stimulation, BUT the fabric they used for the overall body and legs of the octopus is not nearly as soft as it could have been. really stuffy feeling. like a stuffed toy from 80s would be? not sure if that makes sense, but its not rough exactly, but not the plush soft fabric i envisioned is really lacking. my baby likes it so far tho so that is good. he likes the squeaking."
3,octotunes,I bought this for my 5 month old as a Christmas present after reading all the great reviews about it. She is not that interested in this toy right now. She has other toys that have the touch/feel/sound concept similar to this one and likes them but doesn't seem to like this one. Maybe she will with time...
2,These are not tight enough for hair covers,"I notice the other reviews deal with using these as bowl covers. Well I wanted them for my head- since I use henna, and I don't want it leaking all over. The elastic in the caps I received is not a tight fit. I compared it to my other caps (from another source), of which I still have about 10, and the other product is much tighter- which is what you need of you don't want hair color getting all over everything. So I can't say I recommend these- for hair. I'll have to try them as bowl covers, I guess."
1,Poor quality,"The elastic should be a little more sturdy. It does not prevent water from going inside; in other words, the hair gets wet."
1,"THIS IS A D-I-Y KIT, MUST SOLDER IT","The photo shows a completed unit ready to use. However, I received a kit with dozens of components that must be soldered onto the circuit board.No idea if/how it will work, I don't have the time nor skills to do it."
4,wots da reh reh?,"A wicked styles album. Good bassy tunes,hard lyrics and an altogether different sound.BUT where are SOS now? I have not heard a thing about them since this release.Shame really as they made some cool tunes here. Best one is Wots Da Reh Reh ,both versions are bangin'. Lots of tunes and cool unique interludes make this value for money. Better than American rap!"
3,"Call of Cthulhu Gamemasters Pack (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, 8801)","Call of Cthulhu Gamemasters Pack (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, 8801) is an OK purchase, The adventure is fun, but the screen, although good looking, wasn't designed well for a GM. I found it a bit overpriced for what I got."
5,Cocker Spaniel Note Pad,I first got my Cocker Spaniel Note pad from the County fair and I liked it so much I had to see if I could order it. I had looked on the back of the note pad and I looked it up on the internet. I use them by my computer and I also use them for my orders from people for my slippers I knit.Jacquie
3,"What the heck is ""344""","Only 4 episodes left. They better start picking up the pace..... last 3 weeks have been REALLY boring (#4, #5 #6 ). Everything is about Black Sean marrying Tommy's daughter. This better not end up being a dream..... that has Tommy rushing into the WTC on 9/11/01. I smell a stinker ending, second only to the series ""LOST"" who had THE worst ending of any series... EVER."
4,All Good Things Must Come to an End.....,"Franco's character uttered the term during the finale at it was fitting. The show Rescue Me had come to it's end. Leu's eulogy brought tears to your eyes. You realize that the characters that you've grown to love and hate are gone for good. Then you slapped with the reality that Leu is the one that's gone. From there the show just wraps everything up into a nice little pile. Everyone was true to form and excellent. The ending was perfect with the buddies riding off into the sunset.True enough the show had run it's course. There were no more stories to tell. Watching Damion in his wheelchair had become uncomfortable, Franco had become a bitter, egomaniac, and Tommy's stuttering, illogical ramblings were getting tiresome. There could be no coming back after losing Leu. He was the sane piece that kept it all together. His passing was the perfect ending to a great show. I'm really going to miss it."
4,Love,"Really wish Rescue Me was still on TV, but at least you can buy the Seasons to watch over and over"
2,Richard Starkly,"RINGO STARR * CHOOSE LOVE is mediocre. Cliche-laden lyrics, Beatle song references (like the Bungalow Bill ending of ""Oh My Lord""), and tons of sharp-cheddar cymbal do not a great album make. When the best thing about a CD is the booklet's artwork, there's a definite problem. The music's too dense, rhythms are Boom-chuck City and the songs forgettable. I've tried, but can't warm to this one.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 44:36"
4,Bingo Ringo,Well worth the wait. Ringo has aged well musically. I always find peace when I listen to his CD's. Great musical arrangements and wisdom can be found within. Peace and love.
5,You hear the difference?in his last four album,"Pinoy ako..Hey Jude ringo starr is improving then,It is so incisive through my ears the meaning of the songs flourish to my head and vanish through my loneliness,with sense music because of love appreaciation to the whole production,they had all sane mind to produce this kind of music dealt with LOVE PEACE and TRUTH,no pretention will pass in your hungry ears through your searching mind and heart in this kind of music did,dont be recluse to your selection ringo starr cd.Choose love is different dimension in music cause the arrange of this cd are well arrange because some of the drum track are recorded live.Before I never appreaciate ringo's music but when I heard some of his album my happiness make different through beyond of my unconcious mind,whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat a great deal bwagahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhah!"
3,"It's Ringo, so if you are a fan....","Ringo Rama was much better. There are a 2 or 3 gems on this cd, but you will need to listen to pick them. Your Ringo collection would be incomplete without this, but that could very well be the only reason to buy it. I had hoped it would be as catchy and as memorable as I thought Ringo Rama was. I can say I was disappointed by it. Ringo can do much better. The bottom line is, if you are a fan, buy it."
5,Ringo's Best in Years,"I have been buying Ringo's recent studio albums since Vertical Man and this is the best of the bunch. The three first songs are great. I highly recommend it. I'm looking forward to seeing his concert from last month on the PBS show ""Soundstage"" later this year."
5,Cute Doll,This doll is really cute and sweet and gives off that Barbie is still fashionable but not Hoochy (Like another doll)(I think all of u know which it is)this is a really great buy and I think it is really adorable and it actually does have an educational value and sets a good example for young girls
2,...you could do worse...,"Biggest disappointment relates to Yerushalayim shel Zahav (Jerusalem of Gold). Since the names of the artists are not included, one cannot know until actually listening (and after purchase) that this beautiful song is NOT performed by the original artist (Shuli Natan, I believe). The song is still beautiful, but its just not the same when performed by a guy (leading to some buyer's remorse). What your left with is a collection of old Israeli songs. Now, if this is what your looking for, you could do alot worse for [the asking price]."
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Jason Statham is right on top of the action genre mountain and this film once again shows why! Great movie! Everything you want in an action flick, lots of twist and turns, bullets, and f words flying around, and it was really awesome to see Statham and Snipes passing on their knowledge to the next generation of action star aka Ryan Phillipee."
5,Nice!,"I decently applaud the movie, it was excellent, eye catching and it kept you on the edge of the seat!"
2,imminentley forgettable,"I am a Transporter fan, but this isn't Transporter.... I've already forgotten what it's about....This is Not Stethams best work...."
3,"Chaos, but predictable chaos","Warning! You will probably know like I did who is involved in the heist well before the ending. In fact it seems to drag when one of the main characters is killed off and you will figure they aren't really dead and you of course are right. At first you may think they are playing possum to catch the bad guy or you may figure they are in cahoots with the bad guy since they survived. I am not saying I didn't watch three quarters of the movie because it has reasonably good acting. What I am saying is it is as though they dropped the ball and you will feel like you were cheated out of good ending. It feels like they took several other action movies and threw them together. I suggest as a rental, but not to purchase until after you see it. Good quality DVD, mediocre replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Inside Man"" and ""The Italian Job"", both far superior movies. - C. Luster"
2,Interesting plot + So many logical holes + Westley Snipes's over acting = Worth watching once.,"the plot is interesting and complicated. Yet the film has so many logical holes that it looks like a comedy in some scenes. Especially, Wesley Snipes's over acting make it funnier. It's worth watching once."
3,Not Bad For A Rental,This movie was decent. It had several unexpected twists to the story. It was worth the $1.49 I paid to rent it. I wouldn't buy it though.
4,Statham is HOT!!!,"I know this movie got poor reviews from most, but I have a weak spot for Jason Statham, and I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the plot twists."
4,Chaos,"Action, action, action. This is all Jason Statham really truly knows. And like a few other movies he has done (War, Crank), there is a suprise ending to the whole thing. And personally, this suprise ending was rather good. It's a plot twister and its definately a Statham style movie."
2,Don't waste your time...and I'm a Statham fan,"2.2 starsBah, humbug. What a waste of time. If you have any feel for quality crime thrillers at all, you've got to laugh at this, in all the wrong ways.Bad, hackneyed script. Wooden performances in general. Miserable direction; you can tell a bad director when every line out of everyone's mouth feels forced. This felt at nearly all times like a bad tv movie-of-the-week. I like Statham but he's wasted here and clearly needs a director with a better feel for realism. Snipes is ok and Phillippe is too, but his role is overwritten and just seems fake. I didn't buy one second of this movie.Sure, there's a twist at the end, but when nothing that came before makes you care about the tale or the players, what's the difference? There are so many flicks of this ilk out there, and I'd recommend most of them before this insipid jello.Passola."
3,Lack Luster,"I have to say I really do like Jason Statham's movies except for a few, this being one of them. The twist at the end was pretty good but Wesley Snipes was really badly cast, as was Phillipe.The plot was okay, the characters were cookie cutter and Phillipe looked like he was dressing up in his Daddy's clothes and pretending to be a cop.Even Statham whom I generally like looked like he was lack luster about the whole deal..."
2,Wesley Snipes as the bad guy,Don't think I have seen a movie were Wesley Snipes plays the bad guy but guess I just did. Overall the film was ok but not the best work of any of the leading actors. Don't know that the role for Snipes really fit him very well yet was quite different than anything else I have seen him in. Kind of reminded me of 'Takers' some but if you like bank robbery movies then think you could enjoy it.Peter J. Miller
2,it was ok,"Didn't like the ending - while it had some twists, I walked away with the feeling the movie just lacked something - just gave an incomplete with how it ended."
2,Not a good film.,This film didn't work for me. It was heavily muddled and just plain disapponting. Wesley Snipes' part is pretty much a cameo and Jason Statham is not used to good measure. Statham has a lot of dialog and seemed to be pushing his acting ability to the limit. All in all I don't recommend this film either to action fans or Statham fans.
4,Great movie,"Typical action Jason movie, A real thriler,Great movie,If you like Jason,You'll love this movie."
4,Entertaining!!,"I enjoyed this movie as it had more than it's share of twists & turns. The action is great, I like the actors & it's less than $10 for the Blu-ray right now, that's even less than the DVD! The video quality looked great on my 106"" screen through my 1080p Mits HC5000 projector. Grab some popcorn, your favorite drink, sit back and enjoy the ride....with a little chaos along the way! :-)"
2,a huge disappointment of a movie,"Ok, wesley snipes has done some pretty bad movies lately including this one, but what on earth was Jason Statham doing in this terrible film? even he couldn't save this disaster. This movie is very slow paced and lacks action, It is more of a crime drama than an action movie but even the drama lacked suspense and mystery and i literaly had to force myself to keep watching the movie because i felt bored and uninterested.This movie has an average star rating of almost 4 starts, don't fall for the hype!, if you want to see a good recent crime drama movie go watch jean-claude van-damme's ""until death"", Its a much better movie."
3,When will they learn?,"When will Jason Statham and Ryan Phillippe learn to use their natural attributes in film (that would not be their acting ability). Neither takes off their shirt during entire 106-minute film.Plot was predictable.If you love Jason, its another flick to have in your library. He is great. . .but overall it was a predictable disappointment."
4,Chaos Is Right,This is a very good movie. It is fast paced and holds your attention.The story line is believable and the Cinema people did a good job.
4,Great overlooked action flick,"I am not a Statham fan, but picked this up for a gift and it was 9.99 - Wow, what a great movie. I cant believe it was that good. Blu ray quality was also excellent. Alot of twists and turns to the movie, kept my interest and I will watch it again. Can't go wrong w/this movie. Casting along w/acting was good"
5,GREAT ITEM!!,"Overall, it's a great buy. The single includes ""Otherside"", a big hit off of Californication. The reason to buy this is because of ""How Strong"". That song can't be bought anywhere else, I wish it could be so everyone could hear it. Any fan of RHCP will love that song and it's worth the money for the single. It also includes ""Road Trippin' (Without Strings)"", which is an nice raw version of Road Trippin' before the symphonic sounds are added. Finally, the Otherside ""enhanced video"" is included on the disc and is only viewable on a computer, and it's a very good video. If you are a real fan of RHCP, you need to have this."
4,Moradi and Hadadi do it again,"Thisi is the second album from the magical duo. After hearing ""Fire of Passion"" i thought these two could not record anything better then that album. I was proven wrong after hearing a lvie performance of this album and buying it. Moradi has shown everyone that he is truly the master of the Tanbur. Pejman is also magnificent on Tonbak. Hadadi is not your typical traditional drummer, he is the most innovative drummer i've heard. The new techniques he uses on the tombak are controversialy exceptional. THis album is a must have."
3,Gift,This item was purchased for a wonderful lady who was born in Poland and came to the US in the 1950's. I thought the music would remind her of her homeland.
3,Disappointed,For ME this cd was a disappointment. I was expecting something as good as the other Hooked on Classics or Instrumentals or Swing or Big Bands. Not this time.
4,Could be better,"This book was okay. I had high expectations, and I'm sad to say they were not completely meeted. In the story, at Jan Rosen's birthday beach party, Amy gets struck by lightning and gets knocked out. She wakes up in Dr. Hopkins' hospital room, and goes home soon...but finds herself with phychic abilities!"
3,Not too interesting . . .,"From the back cover, this book sounds good, but it really isn't that great. It was OK but that's the most I can say. After a while, Amy's mind-reading power got a little boring, and what the hell was up with the lunch lady thing? That was just dumb. They should have had something involving the organization. And made it a LITTLE longer! I paid four-fifty for that, Jeez, was that a waste of money . . ."
3,*YAWN!*,"I completely agree with Jessie, whose review is dated October 3, 2001. I'm a huge fan of the Replica books, and this one was totally boring. I practically almost fell asleep. It didn't explain how or why she started seeing the future, and...yeah. I didn't like this one. But I do recommend the others."
4,Happy Teacher,I used Dr. Fry's 1000 Instant Words list as the basis of my spelling program. My students made excellent progress and test scores were great.Thanks for offering this type of resource.C. Howsden
3,Most Words,"Edward Fry's book contains a list of the 1,000 most commonly-encountered words in American English. It is intended as a resource for teachers of reading, writing and spelling. Obviously. Most of the book is comprised by this list in two forms. The first is organized into five-word groupings in descending order by frequency (the, of, and, a, to... through ...seat, division, effect, underline, view). The second is an alphabetical list of the same 1,000 words. There are also some materials that support teaching and testing mastery of these words.Undoubtedly useful for teachers and parents, this resource is also useful for text mining as a reference list to help identify documents which contain a greater than expected proportion of relatively infrequent words. Fry has used this list in developing several versions of his well-known readability scale. There are likely other unanticipated uses in computer analysis of language."
5,Great Resource for Adult Literacy,"I've been using Fry's 1000 Instant Words book for years now with my adult and disabled literacy students. Learning the first 100 or 300 words truly gives my students an achievable goal-something about knowing that 100 words can be such meaningful progress really helps motivate struggling readers. The closer we get to our mutually set goal of 100 or 300 or 1000, the more excited my students become. A quick experiment with them where they highlight words they know from this list in a newspaper shows just how significant a proportion of basic reading is accounted for by these few words. Many of the first 100 are not phonetic, and truly do need to be memorized anyway.I'm so glad I found this resource; it's made a huge difference in the lives of my students and in helping me to organize my own teaching with developmentally delayed clients. In the right hands, this book can truly bring a lot of hope to a lot of people who've felt they never would be able to learn to read."
2,"lackluster sketches, interesting writing","There are vintage Bourgeois books that justify the inflated pricetag: ""Memory and Architecture"", for example.But looking through ""Drawings and Observations,"" it is hard to find any visual to indicate that the artist is an inspiring genius. In fact, the works range from juiceless mediocrity to cartoony. They're like the level that most artists would toss.The only redeeming value I can see is psychological insight - just in case her truly fine work doesn't do the job for you.The writing, on the other hand, has tremendous value on how this artist thinks as she creates.All of her work seems to have depth of thought behind it. Art students would benefit from reading this book. And the sketches, even though they are of no significance aesthetically, are important as illustrations in tandem with the writing.NOTE: It's heartening that, at this point, the price has come down so that it is now affordable for art schools and students."
4,BoxWave Kindle Fire Satin Pink Leather Elite Case - Twilled Pink Synthetic Leather Book Cover,"Very nice, quality Cover - practical and useful for a good price.Purchased it for a Teen Grand Daughter, but my wife ended up using it - both loved it."
5,an attractive and functional case,I wanted a case for my Kindle Fire that would stay closed and therefore protect the screen. This case has a snap tab closure that fulfills that function. It is neat and professional looking and has a somewhat padded feel that does not take up significant space but would provide some protection in case my Fire is dropped.
4,"An ""A"" for Erik Johnson's 2nd book!!!","THE AUTOMATIC GIRL is a short book. A quick read. But a fantastic read. I found it to be very cinematic. So if you're the type that enjoys reading screenplays and such I would HIGHLY recommend this book to you. The inner monologue of the lead character, Smith Corona (nice parents, huh?), gives this tale PUNCH - a mix of quirky humor and dark insight. I have no problem giving this book at least a 93%, ""A"" rating. Or 4 stars... ""two thumbs way up"" or however you prefer your reviews. I'd be a failure if I forgot to encourage you to check out Erik Johnson's first book PLANETFALL (also available on AMAZON.COM)."
1,LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY,"Be sure to listen to this production as it appears to be a very old, poor quality recording. You cannot return it after you listen to it so be sure to listen first."
5,Classic Advertising Book By The Master Craftsman,"The secrets of profitable advertising are all here. This book has sample ads that show which ones pull the best. A real treasure of advertising results. Written back in the day when your advertising had to make money right away or you didn't eat.I'm so glad the reprinted this 2012 edition without taking out all the proven strategies...by ""updating"" the content.One of the top five books ever written on advertising to sell.Buy it, you can't have my original copy."
5,good westerns-i love`em,"I have long been a Charles Bronson fan. this is one of the best westerns I have watched & at 76 years old I have watched a lot. no glitz & glamour in this one, just a realistic old west masterpiece."
1,The picture quality sucked!,"I watched about 5 minutes and turned it off! Could barly make out the actors, very grainy and dark. Bad"
5,Everything you need to know about Exchange 2000 is here.,Great book! I had administered earlier versions of Microsoft Exchange but was new to Exchange 2000. There was not a single question that I had that this book did not have an answer for. Outstanding!
5,I've finally found something that I can run with!,"This book is a complete guide that shaped my perspective in dealing with exchange at work. This is all of the real world, day to day ""what you need to know and do"" information that so many books lack.If you are looking to study for the exchange exam this is the wrong item. Instead this very well written book will make you feel like the author is standing over your shoulder pointing out what is what, how to maintain and troubleshoot them all as well.Full of checklists, how to's and the authors real world experiences and advice. Thanks Jim. Great job!"
2,This album is annoying,"I bought this CD for two reasons. The first was because the Lead vocalist is a favorite of mine and the second was because of the price. The opening song builds you up and you expect to hear a great follow up to it but... The keyboards kick in. This album is boring and the keys are aggravating. I hate overuse of keyboards. So, for the price I guess I got what I payed for. Check out Firewind for something similiar but MUCH cleaner sounding and more creative."
2,I knew what I was buying but,"I know that they base these sea creatures off of the real thing, but I do believe this is a bit on the small end. Could have been a tiny bit bigger and still been realistic!"
4,Why stop in 1968?,"For some reason, Rhino Records ended its Billboard Top Country Hits Series with the year 1968. Later Rhino resumed the series with albums for the years between 1986 and 1990. But that still left the years between 1969 and 1985 without Billboard Country albums. Perhaps there was too much country pop in the 1970's and early 1980's to please hard core country fans. In any case, Billboard Top Country Hits: 1968 features some of the artists who were to dominate the next decade: Conway Twitty, Glen Campbell, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard and Tammy Wynette, as well as novelty acts by Henson Cargill (""Skip a Rope"") and Jeannie C. Riley. All in all, I'd give this a 4."
3,Review of a review,I Have the HD100 and please to not listen to the reviewer who states there is no reset button. If they had taken the time to read the instructions they would know which keys need to be pressed to reset. Also the buttons are not at all hard to press i have no idea what this reviewer is talking about.its only fault is that it should have had an AM/FM radio.
2,Crash! Crash! Crash!,Bought it about 6 months ago. Conclusion? fabulous device ruined by appalling software and support. Particularly like the line-in recording to MP3. But the PC software is a disgrace and digital rights protection means you can't drag and drop MP3's to your player. So using the Philips software is not optional (there's no other way to load mp3's) and it crashes... often. I tried updating the firmware; and now windows closes down the software every try to upload music. I have emailed Philips customer support (in detail) and despite the promise of a 24 hour response I have had only an automated acknowledgement and no solution 3 days later. Such a pity! Incidentally changing the headphones dramatically enhances sound quality.
2,BAD,I Purchased this in order to listen to my music....(of course its an mp3 player) the sound quality was bad u didnt have enough options there was no stop button (to my knowledge) and it was a pain. heres the really bad part. Normaly u can rip music from cd's and send them to well mp3 player with this you cant i called philips and asked them for help and they did they simply said with this philips model you have to download seprate software.....i was like what?! i spend good money on this product and i want the same i shouldnt have to download seprate software for this to do what i want.i personaly had a 20gb model but itsprobally as bad as this model here anyways i wouldnt recommend this mp3 jukebox to anyone .
3,you know...,"in response to the guy who lives in canada, you're on amazon, you can buy it here on the website."
1,Don't waste your time and money,The software is the worst of 6 different mdesl that i have tried. The phillips does not work with anything but their DMM music software which is extremly slow and there is no drag/drop feature for windows explorer among other problems.
2,Comparison of the Philips to the iPod,"If one had to select between this product and the Apple iPod, the iPod would definitely be the better choice. The iPod costs the same and has the same capacity, yet has a far greater range of features. For one, the iPod has more applications: it contains an array of entertaining games, an address book, a to-do list, a calendar, and many more. For syncing with a PC the iPod comes with Apple's incredibly popular iTunes jukebox software that works on both Macintoshes and Windows computers. The iPod also comes standard with a cradle that the iPod rests in rather than a cable that will clutter your workspace. On the iPod itself there is a scroll wheel which may ease navigation, of which itself and the control buttons contain no moving parts. The Philips Audio Jukebox has none of these features and is therefore hardly comparable to the Apple iPod."
1,Poor Design,"I have had a really hard time using the Philips HDD100. It is not very intuitive and has been hard to use. The button placement, menus, etc., seem to all be in the wrong places. Maybe on the next go-round, they'll get it right."
1,Peace of sh*t Poor Battery and OS,my battery lasts less than 40 mins then dies.the software is useless and philips provides NO warranty
1,Don't buy it !!!!,Stick with Ipod. This thing sucks!! It locked up after using it for 1 hr. Looks nice! That's about it!!
2,SOOO pretty and so sucky,"the software for this player is REALLY poorly designed and slow to work. the output is really low. the playlist features are lame. and forget speed, this thing is SLOW.but it is oh so pretty."
3,You'll want like hell to LOVE this film -- but won't!,"I'll admit it was quite amusing to watch heterosexual Alex Bolt (David Niven) running around helter-skelter in a men's steam room, peeking under towels, in a frantic search to discover the alleged male model he believed his (unfaithful?) wife had employed to sculpt a giant, honorary statue of him -- a statue, as it turned out, that was far ""too generously"" equipped with the kind of ""plunger"" few men on God's earth could boast having.Fantastic, screwball idea sinks pitifully under the weight of its own stodgy direction and lame script.Three overly generous stars for effort and (unrealized) potential."
4,Excellent B Grade Movie,It feels good to say that I actually enjoyed watching this after I purchased the DVD which turned out to be a decent enough investment. The acting is what is expected in a B-Grade movie...not that crash hot but the fight scenes are cool and some demonstrations performed by Lima make up for the lack of serious acting. Martin Kove and Gary Busy were the two best actors in the film.What I liked most about Beyond The Ring is the storyline and the realism involved. Not so much realistic fight scenes but you can see that our hero (the main character) is only human and not a one man army who can bash up 10 people at a time.I recommend Beyond The Ring to anyone who is a martial arts movie fan like myself but everyone has different taste. I hope those who don't take these kind of movies too seriously can sit down and enjoy watching this.
3,Beyond the Ring,"This movie is ""OK"" to watch. The theme and storyline are alright and pretty realistic; however, the acting wasn't the best i've seen. There wasn't as many fight scenes as I wanted. If I could do it all over agian. I'd rather rent the movie instead of buying it."
3,OK,these plow sides are well built. smaller than I thought they would be. I use to plow commercial lots with my truck and I had plow wings on one of my trucks. they added to the size of the plow. these are just like a little edge to stop slide off. no rubber edge either. I bought a piece of rubber belt and added the edge.
1,Lo-Fi? How about NO-Fi...,"I picked this one up by chance after scanning the liner notes and noticing the songs they covered. Hey, they name drop The Small Faces, Brian Auger, Booker T. etc etc...they even cover the mod classic ""Bert's Apple Crumble""...it's gotta be good, right? WRONG! The singer obviously has some talent, but the rest of it was really painful. The production is horrible, and the guitar sounds out of tune! It was PAINFUL! I actually took it back to the store and returned it within an hour of the purchase. Is this what they mean about ""updating"" classics with ""punk energy""? To me, it's just masquerading or disguising the fact that if they tried straight up cover versions they would fall on their faces. Well they did anyway. Seriously folks, if you like any of the artists mentioned above, AVOID THIS, it's a complete pile of _ _ _ _."
3,Functional but not as Uesful,"The holster is fine, very functional but the clip-on does not work with a belt of any thinkness. Works OK if you clip to a pocket or other material but the clip is much difficult to open to a normal belt thickness.Clip on is misleading - should be called a pry-on"
3,"Nice pouch, lousy clip","The holster is very quick and compact, and secure enough. It seems like it would fit any conventional clippers. The clip is secure once attached, but it is so stiff it is hard to clip on to bluejeans, and a belt is out of the question. I wish it came with a belt loop instead."
3,They should advertise the measurements,"High quality leather and sturdy metal clip, but a bit small for my clippers. Does not have a belt attachment loop."
4,"Great, but wears down belt.","I am a professional horticulturist, so I have a Felco's holster on my belt 40 hrs a week. This was my first Felco's holster for my pruning shears. It lasts a long time and it is easy to put in and remove your pruners from the holster. With the clip, you don't need to undo your belt. However, the clip doesn't always stay on. Chairs and other items can snag the holster and pull it off your belt. Hopefully, you notice when this happens. The other downside is that the clip slowly wears down your belt, but only in the spot where it is clipped. When mine wore out, I replaced it with a holster that has a belt loop. I'm tired of replacing my belts.For the weekend gardener, this is a good option. If you use it a lot, save your belt and get one with a belt loop."
4,Felco holster for secateurs,"A holster is essential if you own a pair of Felco secateurs. I like the F-912 leather holster because it leaves the handle of your secateurs exposed to easily grab it without looking. Over time, the leather will conform to the shape of the secateurs making it a snug fit and will not easily fall out."
4,cool sounds,"I bought this for my 7 month old because of the neat sounds it makes. He loves to hear the noises. He usually just presses the buttons on the burner, but loves to hear me ""cook"" with it. He likes to bang the pans together, which is much better than the real things!"
3,An adequate desk reference,"By the time I received the book, prices changed significantly leaving the book with it covers open. Moreover, the book fails to be comprehensive, especially for the 1880s'.However, the book is good start, and it does provide useful information. It best use is a""library"" copy."
2,Quick Delivery; Flimsy Constructions,"The package was shipped very quickly - that was appreciated. I have the same exact TV as the one featured on Amazon.com's graphic and on the box of the product (both GE items).The first thing I noticed is that the plastic rivet do-dad in the middle of the turntable kept falling apart when I first put the TV on top of it. After several tries in which I would place the unit under the TV and the turntable's middle rivet would pop out, I eventually figured out that the TV has to sit in exactly the right spot of the swivel or I ended up scrambling on the floor looking for the detached plastic rivet do-dad.The best way to make this work - use two people. One person lifts up the TV, the other one slips the unit under it in just the right spot.Anyway, I've had the turntable for a day or so and it seems okay now. I recommend buying the swivel only if you have some patience with this kind of thing."
5,tv freak,"Speedy delivery, excellent condition, nicely packaged. thank you for your great service. I gave this as a gift and was unable to find it anywhere, but as usual, Amazon came through with flying colors!"
5,Perfect for what it does!,"I bought this item in order to be able to turn my TV in different directions in my bedroom. Even with a 100 lb TV, the Easy Turn TV Turntable moved easily with no resistance at all and it is absolutley silent when turning. Very pleased with this purchase and the turntable works perfect for what it does."
4,Works great,"Works great. Very thin so it's not obvious that my TV is sitting on it. Very smooth and easy to turn the TV. I use a 27"" CRT."
3,not so great,"The title of this cd is film classics Ferrante & Teicher, but this is not the their best recording. The piano arrangements is not distinct and it is eaten up by lousy orchestration making it midiocre, which is a pity.Look for the older versions of this talented duo instead of buying this."
4,"Simple, quick","While his little show makes me want to jump out a window, his cookbook lives up to its name. Quick and easy, and the recipes actually work, unlike with many other cookbooks where the recipes do not turn out. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because the book lives up to its name and is affordable."
5,Mr. Food's Quick & Easy Diabetic Cooking,"Brief and to the point, this book was just WONDERFUL. Mr. Food's TV recipes always seem so deliciously decedant. This book is also delicious ... but very far from decadent! Loved it!"
1,Not worth the price,This is a book that basically is a reurn of common everyday recipes. They are not specific to Diabetics. They use far too much sugar and fats in the supposed diabetic foods. There is little info on carbs and other essential information for those who low carb to control their diabetes.
3,Mr. Food Diabetic cook book,This book has lots of good recipes. I can't wait to try some of them. It has all the nutritional information printed for each recipe also which will come in very helpful.
1,Disappointed in lotion,"Based on the rave reviews for this product and because I am not allergic to any of the ingredients listed, I ordered this lotion. It has been a big disappointment. I find it to be uncomfortably sticky on the skin. This stickiness remains for a very long time. The lotion does not feel at all soothing and leaves a shiny surface. My face developed red irritation patches. After several tries on my body, I have decided that I will regrettably dispose of this lotion in the garbage."
5,Wibi is the best!,"This is the best lotion ever! It has been around for decades. Don't let the plain, medicinal bottle fool you! I believe years ago it was available by prescription only. I have used many expensive body and face moisturizers.....nothing works as well. You can see dry, scaly skin plump up and smooth out. It only heals skin, but improves texture and firmness. I am so pleased that Wibi is available on Amazon. Ordering from the pharmacies is often a hassle."
1,Not Worth It,"Not a lot of original research here. The author seems to ""borrow"" an awful lot from public domain documents about IDEF. Several of the case studies in Chapter 5 are lifted verbatim from MetaSoftware's marketing literature. Lots of disparate chapters, no unifying theme. This is going to be the first book I've ever bought from Amazon that I will be returning. Definetely not recommended."
1,Lacks substance,The book contains very little practical information and spends more chapters selling the reader on the concept of process mapping than it does on the concept itself.
3,process mapping,"a good book although I was looking for a book to help me broader my knowledge of quality. im looking for something perhaps with more details about lot sampling, SPC even six-sigma...still overall a good book for those of you in the begining stages of quality process mapping."
5,Excellent,"Easy language, nice examples, easy explanations, lots of references about other authors and books related"
1,Pre School,"There is nothing in this book that and educated practioner or someone who's on the path to becoming one would find of value. The name of the book is a misnomer, most chapters dealt with motherhood concepts around BPR, very little time and effort was devoted to the actual Business Process Mapping practices. All in all a disappointing book leaving a void in a subject much in need of guidance."
4,Sturdy... Well Maid,"This was a good purchase for the sorter, it is heavy and well maid. Really satisfied with the quality of the product."
5,Great shoe,"Light, very supportive, true to size. I've run 5K's and 1/2 marathons and it provides great stability and is one of the most comfortable lightest running shoes I've ever worn."
4,Good but incomplete,"Highly cerebral this book is not. The characters are shallow, the action is one-dimensional and the ending is so abrupt as to make you feel the full novel was literally torn in half and the first part was published. The scenery is vivid and one can almost see the colors of battle. The action is very fast passed and shown from varying points of view.It is not necessary to have read the other novels in the series to enjoy this book, but it would help to understand as to how the characters came to be were they are and the author expects you to be somewhat familiar with what drives them.An incomplete work but I loved it."
3,Hack and Slash.,"Latest of Felix&Gotrek novels and the best of the whole bunch. If you are looking for an afternoon of chaos mayhem and plain action, this is the book for you. The book like all the rest in the series is easy to read, fast paced and hard to put down. The characters are like those in a comic book (one dimensional). The good are just so good and the bad are just rotten evil. King does a great job in making you feel you are in a vast city laid to a siege by an invincible army. His descriptions are so vivid you can easily imagine the scenery, see the tremendous siege engine rolling forward and the howling horde trying to breach the walls . As a whole reading this book is like going to a good action packed film without any complications / drama / or regrets."
4,College Football Is Here,"all im saying is this game deserves 5 stars and oh to the guys that says its running on the madden 2002 engine.. sorry bro, its running on the new madden 2003 engine. :)"
2,Bugs,"I Bought this game the day it came out and tooked it home and played it for about two days. The third day i went to play it and the XBOX said the disc was damaged. I returned it back to the store and the guy who was working there said his was doing the same thing and alot of other people said theirs was to. I swapped my game for another one and the first time i put it in it said the game was damaged so i took it back and got my money back. When the game was working it was great. The graphics and gameplay were awesome, but i got tired of messing with it."
2,"Great, but...","Well, I was of the same opinion as the other reviewers, but I ran into a severe problem with the game after three days of play. After I had finished playing a game I received the XBox black screen of death indicating that my disc was damaged or dirty. I of course took the steps recommended on the XBox website (cleaning the disk, powering off/on), yet I still received the same error when I tried to access my saved season. I exchanged the game for a new copy and I still got the error when trying to access my season profile, so I finally called the 800 XBox number. They said that I had to delete my entire NCAA data block in order to correct the problem since apparently the game ""choked"" during the save process and made the file errant. The 800 number explained that they have received numerous complaints exactly like mine for the game SPECIFICALLY, so unless you like having ALL of your saved data deleted I'd wait for the Sega NCAA (hopefully it's better!)."
2,Kettle Corn,"I was trying to find an cheaper alternative to Cacotin Kettle Corn that would cost less or give me more popcorn for my buck. This one is cheaper but the Kettle Corn did not have that sweet toastiness coupled with saltiness that drives us crazy at fairs and markets. Although it's edible and decent, I would go back to Cacotin Kettle Corn just for the taste and it's crispiness."
5,Science Fiction With A Hilarious Twist,"This book is a hoot! The author starts with some simple premises of the Star Trek genre and proceeds to weave a story that is entertaining, fast moving, running over with wit and humor. Her characters are interesting, too. She knows people. The only problem with Anomaly Adventures is that it reads too fast. I tried to pace myself so it would last longer, but I couldn't."
1,Not a lesbian book,This was a weird little sci-fi book which I could barely understand and was published as 'print under demand' house. The book is cheap looking and has a dark subject matter (human are imprisioned by an alien race and a woman from the past is sucked in the future and is asked to save mankind.) I have no idea why this book is listed as a 'lesbian title.' There is nothing gay about it and I dumped this book.
1,broken case,"The first set i got came with a cracked case. The first replacement set I got , the chip holders were all crushed . The second replacement set i got had a small crack in the case and the chip holders were crushed again . I don't know who is at fault U.P.S or the set maker. The set is not built very well to hold the weight of the chips during transport . I would not buy this set again ."
2,Not Happy,We received these chips with one broken into four pieces. The edge is made up of numerous small bits. The case was not in perfect shape either. The Air Force covering had to be pried under the edge with a screwdriver so it wouldn't peel off. We've used the chips twice and two of the Plane stickers have already come off. We are most displeased and will be returning this item. I do not recommend purchasing these.
2,Severe Case damage,"The chip set was fine, but we had to send the set back twice before getting one whose exterior case and interior structure were acceptable. One of the chip cases might have been run over by the delivery truck, judging from the badly buckled look of the case itself! The third send was OK, even though we still had to get out the epoxy for some interior repair before putting it under the Christmas tree!"
4,cool power metal,well... this is a good and new power metal from (of course) scandinavia.it is not SONATA ARCTICA or STRATOVARIUS and they need to work on their music but it is a new and good band. i think that if you want a good cd go and buy this cd...they will have more cd's i hope and they'll improve.
5,Have to be known,Zonata is a very good band of power metal. They are very good to mix metal with a wonderfull melody.
3,Those were the days,"This is a very good compilation of some of the geat old time musicals and worth every cent of the money I paid, I suuggest old timers like me to buy this box set from Amazon to bring the great memories of our young days. John Fenech Malta"
4,The Good Old Days,"I've only watched a few of these so far and, by today's standards, they're somewhat ""smalzy"". But maybe we need more of that in today's world. I like the innocence and respect portrayed in these 30's and 40's movies. They're entertaining in a clean and decent way. Voice quality on some leaves a little to be desired, but headphones help."
1,Musical classics 50's movies,very dissapointed not clear dvd's at all not possible for me to watch to much movement in the pictures i ended up putting them in the bin.
2,somewhat dissappointed,"some of the movies that claim to be in color are black and white. not too many really good movies, but i guess you can't expect much for the price."
3,Películas clásicas,"Es una buena oportunidad de recuperar, por poco dinero, unas películasd clásicas que están en el recuerdo de todos los mayores. Lástima que no estén dobladas al español."
2,50 MUSICALS BOX SET,WELL I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT LOVING MUSICALS BUT UNFORTUNATLEY I SUPPOSE ONE SHOULD REALISE WHEN YOU BUY THIS AMOUNT OF FILMS IN A BOX SET THAT WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT IS MOSTLY BAD QUALITY I HAVE DONE IT BEFORE AND I HAVE NO DOUBT I WILL DO IT AGAIN ...WILL I EVER LEARN THE PACKING IS GREAT AND I DONT MIND DOUBLE SIDED DISCS OR EVEN TWO FILMS TO A SIDE BUT THE QUALITY ISNT GREAT AT ALL WHY DO THEY DO IT ?? WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO SAY ..RE..DO THESE OLD FILMS ..EVEN IF YOU PAID MORE FOR THE SET WHICH I THINK MOST PUNTERS WOULDNT MIND JUST TO GET GOOD QUALITY FILMS MOST OF THE FILMS ARE OF REALLY BAD QUALITY A COUPLE ARE OK BUT I DONT THINK I COULD SIT THROUGH VERY BAD QUALITY FILMS SO BUYER BEWARE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND DONT EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD
3,Musical Classics,"This is a good compilation of little seen and forgotten films from way back which should please nostalgia buffs. Quite a number of them, however, don't really qualify as being musicals, such as ""Breakfast in Hollywood,"" which contains only a couple of songs sung on a real life radio show back in the 40s the movie was made to promote. Overall, I recommend it, as it contains early films from stars such as Bing Crosby and Lena Horne, along with an interesting array of old black musicals."
4,Thumbs up!!,"I know these are public domain movies, and the source quality can usually be iffy, but Mill Creek does a great job in packaging and pricing these movies. Each of the discs in this package comes in its own sleeve with titles, descriptions and running times. Sure, some of the prints are pretty worn out, but they don't spoil the fun. There were a couple of titles I had been looking for, but other distributors were asking between 5 and 15 dollars per title. This way I got the titles I wanted, plus 48 extras! Recommended."
1,Musical Classic's DVD Pack,"Not worth buying. Unfortunately, mainly very poor quality 'classic' movie DVD's. Only a few of them worth watching. Also, each DVD has 2 sides and it's difficult to read the small print to id the film. Further, all DVD's stacked into a box (initially in numerical order - an accompanying booklet helps to id them and provide a short movie precise), but easy to get out of order if you don't have an alternate filing system."
1,Musical Movies,"I was disappointed by this collection. Many of the movies were in such poor condition that it was not possible to view them. I realize that they are all very old movies, but still ...."
4,Musicals,I love musicals. This will keep me busy for a while and I have not seen any of these particular movies.
5,She loves this,"My friend is a big musical fan and I'm not, but when I saw this I knew she would love it. She watched it for 2 days straight and then called me and thanked me several times for it. I recommend this for any person that loves the old musicals."
2,hidden,"this cd has some gems but for the most part these are hidden ,,the Cds are hard to figure what is what and many of the films are obscure but not great.. These Cds needs to be pruned and clearly titled..."
3,for absolute musical fans only,"50 musicals and musical shorts - most of them unknown to average public and, looking at them, you'll easily understand: most of them are B productions. But still, there are always interesting things to see, even if the printing quality and the framing is not always excellent. Finally: for a very moderate price you get 50 items, even if you like only 10, it's worth it !"
4,Appreciating the classics,"A collection of mostly obscure(to me) movies, most of which are good quality, and quite entertaining. All are musicals, and some feature artists who were just starting out back then. A good number of the movies are black and white, but oddly , this does not diminish the enjoyment. A lot of bang for the buck!"
2,Review of 50 Classic Musicals,"The content is not as good as I thought it would be. The quality is very poor in some of the films. A lot of the films are ""B"" movies. The songs are pretty good and to see some of the older pictures of the later stars are fun to see. There are very few color movies the rest being B/W. Overall the price was acceptable but I wouldn't pay more."
1,"Mill Creek, Enough Said","Mill Creek Entertainment is notoriously known to be one of the worst companies around who ruin every movie on their label. Very poor quality and a total waste of your money. If you want to see any of these movies, you are better off locating a single disc on a label widely known, Fox, UA, Universal, Paramount... Stay away from any movie on the Mill Creek label."
5,Musical Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,Any one who loves old musicals will love this set. Some I remember growing up as I am a big fan of musicals. Others I had never seen before so they were an extra treat. Would recommend this to all who remember the days of movie musicals. Also younger folks who don't know what they missed and could get a great experience of mid-century movie nostalgia.
4,"A very good 3.5"" enclosure from IOGear.","It is a very sleek toy, IOGear has done a good job creating that thing; it is almost the only enclosure which supports HDD over 280MB. I recently changed my 300GB HDD to the Hitachi's 500GB and it works just fine, assembling the thing is easy enough and doesn't require much, the only thing the kit is missing is a firewire 9Pin to 6Pin cable. After trying several other enclosures I definitely decided to use that one although its plastic cover is not the lightest one available."
4,DELIGHTFULL!,"This is a delightfull and witty book. You can probaly figure who 'dunnit' half way thru, but it's still a fun read."
3,Sometimes books are out of print for a reason.,"I'm having a difficult time figuring out who the intended audience for this book might be. Fans of good mysteries will be turned off by the gaping holes in the plot. Similarly, aficionados of hardboiled crime will be disappointed in the narrative's lack of grittiness and its careful avoidance of anything truly depraved. And readers who appreciate good, believable writing irrespective of genre will also be unsatisfied since the novel's plentiful dialogue is thoroughly unconvincing.When all is said and done, Say It With Bullets is a rather far fetchedaction-adventure tale with a touch of romance that is equally far fetched. Yes, the book is fast paced and contains a number of mildly amusing quips. But, overall, I would not recommend this pulp fiction relic."
5,I rate this one 5 bullets out of 5,"Hard Case Crime successfully recreates the excitement of a time when print was the primary source of entertainment. The covers, the design, and the engaging stories, take the reader back to a time when crimes were solved by guts, brains, brawn, and the occasional beauty mixed in just for inspiration. I can't wait until the end of the day to escape into the shadows these writers imagined so well in these stories.Richard Powells ""Say it with Bullets"" is not only gripping, and entertaining, but the author has a sense of humor that just doesn't quit. I found myself chuckling and laughing out loud as I made my way through the mystery.Turn off the television and get comfortable for this one. you won't want to put it down."
4,Great 1950's detective story of revenge and justice,I grew up in the fabulous 50's and loved the references to buses for traveling and the perky young lady who has a mind of her own. I liked the characters and was suprised by the ending. The main character was consistent and used the clues available to make a plan to find out who is trying to kill him.
5,"Sturdy, Colorful, and Fun!","The Gold Prospector wooden cars work on the Thomas wooden tracks, and are quite durable. The plastic ""tumbler"" chamber on the first car is thick, and rotates as the wheels turn--tumbling pieces of ""gold"" within. The gold car features a load of nuggets coated in a faux gold finish.The trains are dark red in color, and feature golden emblems like a large ""S"" and ""Sodor Mining Company"" on the side.My 6 year old just received this set for his birthday, and loves them! A very nice addition to the Thomas line that is neat to look at, as well as sturdy enough to hold up to rough handling or storage."
2,A disappointment,"Having heard Ricardo Morales live a number of times, I was very disappointed in this cd and am donating it to the local library. His technique is flawless, his tone extremely fine and he can be a marvelous clarinetist, but the performance of these French pieces lacks the style, the expressiveness I would expect from Morales. He is one of the finest clarinetists in this country, but I found the overall recording to be bland and lacking in musicianship."
5,"Awesome, Buy It !!!",A must for Garbo fans. Greta at her best. All 3 movies I give 5 out of 5! Just buy it.
4,Rand Mcnally United States Wall Map (Classic Edition United States Wall Map),"The map itself is fantastic, however it was packed in a tube that was too long so it arrived with both ends crunched up (having bounced from end to end in the mail - I guess!)"
3,outdated,The newest song on this was recorded in 1956. Had I known this I would have never purchased it. I would still be interested in a CD with up to date stripper music.
4,"some great stuff, some okay stuff","I wouldn't neccessary say that all of the cuts on this CD are ""Stripper Music"" but there's enough of them here. And any CD that has honking horns played by Sam ""The Man"" Taylor, Red Prysock, and Syl Austin, is okay with me."
4,just what i needed,"I needed music for the garter toss at our reception and didn't want all the cheesey 80's hair band standards. This fit the bill perfectly...nothing vulgar, just sultry,raunchy sounding jazz that reminds you of an old smoky burlesque club. I love it."
4,Very good summary of major FR/ US cultural perspectives,"Au Contraire: Figuring out the French is a spot on read for any American that has spent enough time in France to move past the wow of the wine, food, fashion and architecture. The authors do a wonderful job of examining the origins of FR/ US attitudes and then gently compare and contrast the countries without passing judgment on either. My one caution to potential readers is: if you're coming to France for a brief tourist holiday, this may not be the book for you. The points touched upon can be quite subtle and thus are unlikely to resonate to any degree for those just passing through."
5,The Bible of French-American business relations,"If you are someone who does business or is interested in doing business with the French, Au Contraire is a MUST read! The authors, Gilles and Ruth, have managed to capture the true essence of the subtle differences between American and French culture, whether they be social, political, historical or economical.Au Contraire's greatest strength is that is leaves no detail unturned. This book is as useful to the sociologist as it is to the adventurous entrepreneur.The writing is poignant yet easy to read. Like a bestseller, the reader is glued to the pages until the final word. If you are curious to know what really make the French tick, don't look anywhere else - Au Contraire has all the answers."
3,steam jet ejector for vacuum system,I do't know how I can buy books in Shanghai China. Are there any office in China.
3,"Thoughtful plot, but hard to follow.","I had to sort of work my way through this novel. I was interested in the characters and in the depiction of relationships between the 'saurs and the humans. However, the jumping back and forth between the two time periods, novel & interesting at first, became rather annoying to me.However, this is rather good space opera, and should satisfy those who enjoy ""hard"" science-fiction. It's good enough that I'll be reading the second part of the trilogy."
3,I am waiting to read the second in the series to fully judge.,"Sometime in the future when the Russians control all of Europe and the US is ruled by corporations, some scientists discover something odd up in space...An interesting book. I like very much the way it weaves political theory and extraterrestrial/theological speculation.What I like less is the way that the book jumps between times. It was confusing and distracting and I found myself going back and re-reading in a state of confusion rather than moving forward. I hope that in a second series installment I would be able to enjoy the book more instead of spending all my time trying to figure out what is happening."
2,Very disjointed,"MacLeod has a good story to tell in Cosmonaut Keep, unfortunately his writing style lacks a lot to be desired. This novel is full of speculative ideas from politics, intrigue, physics, and the nature of the universe, wrapped into what could have been a good story about real people. The writing is disjointed, almost hackneyed. Most of the novel is parallel threads, one set on 21st century earth, and the other a colonized planet at some point in the future. The back and forth between threads is not handled with particular aplomb, so it takes a while to get &#65533;into&#65533; the story and feel comfortable going and back and forth. And while the two threads come together at the end, the denouement is less than satisfying.Overall the general concept of the story is intriguing. There is a lot to be desired in the execution."
3,"Slow starting retread, but worth reading","Macleod's fifth novel - or his second, if you want to treat the first four as a single work - is slow to get going. At page fifty I was beginning to wonder if I really wanted to finish it. But when Macleod's two storylines finally get up to speed, they're compulsive. Having finished the book, my chief reservation is the sense that Macleod hasn't served up anything new: tandem storylines set in the near future and in a space-colonisation future, humans struggling with the implications of nanoscale, superintelligent minds, lovelorn heroes and heroines... it all seemed a bit like a retread. Fun to read, and I'll certainly be picking up the sequel - but if you haven't read Macleod before, start with his earlier ones. They're better."
3,"Decent, Interesting Sci-Fi","Interesting, and a worthwhile read, but it didn't knock my socks off. It was well-crafted, with alternating chapters taking place in two different times and locations, only slowly letting the reader see how they are connected. Clues for understanding what was going on in one area were given in the other, which was clever, but I found the corresponding changes between first- and third-person a little jarring. The near future is thoroughly detailed and felt like a believable world, but the politics were so complicated I felt it slowed the story down, and I enjoyed the distant future more. It did leave me intrigued about the sequel, and I think overall it's good and engaging sci-fi."
3,Cyber punk meets world making,"I usually don't like the genre of books that alternates scenes and characters every chapter, leaving you to trying to remember where you left off on each story. However, this book does it well and quickly. You know you're coming together on the two story lines about half way through and this makes each one take on more meaning. I enjoyed the cyber-punk, near future story line and loved the ancient mix of wonderful creatures and gods on the strange, new world. It's a quick and not too complex read, with interesting characters and happily 2 more books to follow. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."
2,"High expectations, low fulfillment","Upon reading the inside flap I was hooked and after enduring the first 6 chapters I knew I would be engaged in a marathon, only not the kind I had been hoping for when picking the book up from the shelf. Many times before triumphantly turning the final page I felt as though I had to bite down on a leather strap to make it through the ordeal.The storyline has all of potential to have been an epic on the level of Frank Herbert's Dune, but Ken MacLeod turns away from that challenge by offering trite characters, a shallow plot and an overemphasis (running throughout his work) on marijuana use and an odd fascination with portraying communism as a triumphant ideology. Those who say that MacLeod is the brightest new star in sci-fi are setting their expectations far too low be bestowing that crown upon this author."
4,THE Book on Arborglyphs and Their Historical Context,"This book is great for getting to know the history behind arborglyphs....They are an important source of historical data...This book is mostly about Nevada...There is a lot of good information about the Basque ""sheepmen""/sheepherders....There are a lot of arborglyphs in the Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado...I have seen quite a few myself....The life span of an arborglyphs is about 80 yrs....It is important that we start documenting them now for future generations.....Countless arborglyphs have been lost to time already...check out [...] for more info"
5,Speaking Through the Aspens,"I have just received and begun to read this scholarly, but readable text. Having long been interested in the subject of Basque tree carvings, I originally ordered this book in hopes that it would give me a hint about where to find these tree as I would like to photograph them. I am not sure that I will find specific locations, but I do believe this comprehensive volume will enlighten me on the subject of Basque Tree Carvings as well as the Basque culture in America. Antidotes and photographs make the text quite enjoyable. I am delighted with the book so far and would highly recommend it."
3,Good Basic Chemical Engineering/Fortran book,This book is a great introduction to the use of Fortran for Chemical Engineers. It is somewhat dated but still relevant. I would recommend it as a first book for anyone in modeling in Chemical Engineering
3,I Want My DVD,"I'm a teacher and I found the DVD that came with the earlier editions a great resource for my students, especially those with trouble reading. If you haven't got the 05 book get that one instead. It has a DVD."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"My friend kept telling me to get I life book, she had '05 and it had the CD with it, which she loved.I dont feel this '06 goes into enough depth for me. Maybe my ignorance.... it is not able to keep me wanting to use it.."
3,'06 iLife Dissapointment,"WHERE IS MY TUTORIAL DVD?????? I have the previous 2 editions of iLife and was very exited with the new '06 edition. My order was placed in April and was received in June. I am very dissapointed with this new edition because the Tutorial DVD included with the previous editions was not found in the new edition received. Accordingly a claim was placed with Amazom because the book received do not include the DVD. The book is still a good resource if you are new to iLife, but if you have previous edition with their DVDs, probably there is no much new info you can have. Hope next edition(s)(????) will include the tutorial DVD again."
5,iLife,I've really only used the book to learn how to set up websites using iWeb. It was extremely useful for this program.
3,No DVD in iLife 6 by Jim Heid.,"ILife 6 is OK., but it does NOT contain a DVD. ILIfe 5 had a great DVD. I have no idea why Heid decided to remove or not make a DVD for iLife 6."
5,iLife '06 by Jim Heid.....Helpful Tool,"I needed to learn how to make a DVD, and Jim's book helped me get the job done. His visual guides coupled with his good sense of humor sprinkled into his writing style made the learning process seem less daunting. I aim to continue on with iMovie and iWeb, but the one application made the purchase of the book worthwhile."
4,Too easy...wait until it's cheaper!,"My son, who is by no means a playstaion expert, and in first grade, finished this game in a matter of hours. He really really wanted it (thanks to the commercials) but it was a big let down. Maybe try renting it...you'll be better off."
5,product service 5 star,The game was for my 2nd son for his 14th birthday . The game cams packaged good and 4 days before his bitrhtday...Very pleased
5,Exceptional Motown remixes !,"I am a huge Motown fan and was skeptical of how they would remix this album as I also listent to alot of house , but do not like them mixed.I was not diapointed at all. The original beats were kept in place but with the up-tempo style that is needed to give it that little extra ""ummph"". This is a great CD from the very first song from the Jacksons(which is my favorite) to the ending Rick James remix of Mary Jane.A MUST have for Motown fans who enjoy an up-tempo style."
4,Perfect for road trips,"CD's like this are perfect to drive to when you are ging on a road trip. It takes you down memory lane, and the middle lane of the highway snapping your fingers and tapping your feet."
2,Not a good remix,This is one of the few remixes that left me hanging. There was no imagination. What's the point?
2,Disappointment,"As a music producer myself I can say this collection of remixes of Motown classics is a disappointment. The high points are for ""Let's Get It On"", ""Tears of a Clown"" and ""War"". The rest are poor remixes. Although the word remix does not necessarily mean it will be a dance version, some of these like ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" build up the expectation of a great dance beat to come on that never does. This will go better as background music for a martini party than for a dance party."
2,"A few bright spots, but overall....pretty grim","The only reason I can muster any ""stars"" at all is that 3 of the 15 tracks actually brought a smile to my face.""War,"" agreed, is a song that should probably have gone untouched from its original version. Having said that however, the new mix is fun.""Smiling Faces Sometimes"" is probably most loyal to its original version. A few subtle changes here and there, but this song is hard to screw up. The new version holds up well.To my surprise, the highlight of this ""Remixed"" CD is ""Let's Get It On."" Again, the 1973 version is pretty darn perfect. But I have to admit, old Marvin himself might get a kick out of this one. Still sexy, with a new beat, and it should gain a whole new audience.Can't say much good about the rest; in fact some are unbelievably awful. I would not have believed that there is a way to screw up ""My World Is Empty,"" ""ABC"" and ""Tears of A Clown."" But someone found a way to do it!"
1,Where's the Joy?,"The original Motown hits were popular because they were uplifting, zesty, and fun. The remixes here suck the life out of each song by using urban beats and slower -- dare I say boring -- accompaniments. I have to disagree with the majority of reviewers: these particular classics need more remixed originality or should be left alone."
4,GrownUpMusic.com recommended!,"MOTOWN REMIXEDI'll be honest. I expected this to suck big time. Why mess with classics? But through give and take (give a little flair/take a little excess off), all your favorite Motown hits are back, giving new meaning to ""The Big Chill."" Smokey, Diana, Stevie, Marvin, Gladys, the Temps, Michael and his bros all get a musical facelift (not that Michael needed another one), but the minute you start bee-bopping to the familiar guitar groove if the J5's ""I Want You Back"" with an all-new sexy backbeat, you'll be asking for mo' Motown."
5,Making the Old New Again,"This compliation of remixed classics from the Motown label is really fantastic. Since the original tracks are so good on their own, I was afraid that tinkering with them too much would ruin the songs. Thankfully, the tracks on this album are only fooled with enough to give these songs an updated, fresh feel. My favorite track on this is the fantastic update to The Temptations ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"", which sounds like both a brand new song, and the classic original. Pick this album up, it's that kick-ass Motown sound ready for now."
1,Not good,"As my friend (who was a childhood friend of Eddie Kendricks) and I listen to this, we just shook our heads. Unfortuately, this remixing takes the life out of these brilliant recordings. We broke out one of the original ""Temptations"" albums for comparison. There is no comparison. A lot is lost in this remix."
5,Nice,I am a rock and roll person and got this to have some more typical Christmas sounds. I think I would have gotten Christmas eve party complaints if I only had rock and roll Christmas music. The harmonies are nice. There were a couple songs I started to sing along with so to me it is good to go. Nice quality.
4,Little switch does the job,"I used to work in professional video so I was a bit dubious about buying an inexpensive plastic switch box for home use. However, I'm pretty happy with the unit - it works as advertised. No bells and whistles, just a button for each input you want to use, which is exactly what I wanted for my family to use for selecting video inputs for our A/V setup.I would have liked it to be heavier. With all the cables attached, the unit is too light and needs something to hold it down. I'd consider gluing on a steel plate just to give it more substance.Overall, the switcher is an excellent value. It works well and it doesn't cost a fortune like pro-switchers."
3,Not very exciting...,"I was going through a Neopets phase and visited a friend who had the Kougra version. It seemed fun, so I got the Aisha.Well, I really wasn't very impressed. It just doesn't have that many phases to say. This may be evil, but probably the most fun thing is when you yell at it and it gets sick! I don't really recommend it. Not very much entertainment or educational value. A furby is probably better."
3,The best Pony Pal book ever!,New pony statues are brought into Wiggins. You can paint a life sized pony. Then the pony will be in the Wiggins parade. Of course Anna wants to try out. And she wins! But Tommy and Mike are mad at Anna and Pam and Lulu. Will they mess up the Pony Pals special project? Read this book! Highly recommended.
5,Terrific!,"A great read for children as well as adults. Untraditional in children's lit for the independence of the main character as well as the setting. Unfortunately, only the first three of a total of 14 (!) books in the series were ever translated into English. Luckily, I am Danish (as the author) - I am now rediscovering the joy of these books as well as reading the ones not yet out when I was a kid. A rare treat."
5,Great slippers,Bought the slippers over a year ago. They are very comfortable and warm. The quality is excellent and they show minimal wear (inside and out) even though being worn for more than 6 hours a day. They have an external tread like bottom that minimizes wear while simultaneously providing good support. The stitching is first rate with no signs of any deterioration despite constant use.
1,tactile toast-r-oven,"I purchased this item for 82 year old mother. Disappointed! This oven is a lower cost toaster oven, that has been modified with stick on black numbers. They then charge a lot more money of course. Just not what I was expecting. In some was it makes it harder to operate because these numbers actually cover up the original operational features/numbers on the product. I did not try to return because I know the return shipping cost would just be too expensive. It was advertised as free shipping when I purchased, however there was a special charge of $10 additional because they stated it was oversized. Live and Learn. I would not recommend this product or company."
5,Book purchase,"Book was received and is in great shape, just as we suspected it might be. Thanks for the quick and safe shipment."
2,Not what I expected,"It was stated that this book was in acceptable condition. I guess if you like reading a book in 2 pieces; (literally, in two pieces)it might be okay. When this book arrived it had a rubber band around it to hold it together. I'm concered that when I turn the pages they will detach from the spine of the book. - I read this book years ago, just wanted to read it again. I hope it will eventually be available for the kindle."
5,Get the Facts!!!!,"I wish that people would stop saying they know for a fact that they know what happened to E.C.Mullendore. Yes there are several different story lines to look at.The mafia,Gene(his Dad,Linda(his wife).He was suppose to be trying to get money from the Mafia,but who knows for sure??????If you were not there the night E.C. was killed then you don,t know what really happened.Even if it was Gene,he's dead. Most of the people who were around are also dead.Unless Chub decides to tell the story,no one will know what really happened.The way people have been talking about this is close to slander,yes Chub was an ex-con,but so was alot of the cowboys on the Ranch.Let sleeping dogs lie,If in the future Chub tells what he knows I'll be the first person in line to buy the first book.Until then lets let Chub alone and see what happens.If there was enough evidence on the case, the Grand Jury would have locked him up....."
2,"A vast ocean covering the world of mathematica, but only 1 inch deep.","I believe this book was written to used up as many pages as possible. The structure of the book is as follows. The author presents an idea in about two sentences (which has less insight than Mathematica's own help file), then demonstrates the idea with a series of one-line Mathematica statements over several pages. The statements are all very similar to each other, and the same ideas are repeated from one chapter to the next. Rather than presenting abstract ideas, the author iterates over many possible configurations of a command.In short, this book is an iteration over many combinations of Mathematica symbols. The book is broad in scope, but is thin on insight.Be sure to check out a preview of this book before purchasing it. If you are looking for a reference that will hand you a statement to accomplish a particular task, maybe this is the book for you. If you are looking for a deep understanding of Mathematica, look elsewhere."
1,Bad Book,"Absolutely terrible book. The author fails to explain simple things simply and logically. The author should read ""mathematica for Scientist and Engineers"" by Thomas Bahder or ""Mathematica Navigator"" by Ruskeepaa to see how one should write a book."
3,Legends of Guitar,"A lot of older stuff. Poor recordings but ""hey"" these are old school boys playing when recording just barely got going."
5,One of the Best of the DC Archive Editions,"Most of the Golden Age DC Archives are to be admired for their historical significance in a pleasing format.Honestly, a lot of the Golden Age stories are rather primitive and repetitious and a bit difficult to struggle through.This is one of a few exceptions. It's thoroughly entertaining.(Golden Age Starman is the best looking, art-wise with fun SciFi tinged tales; Golden Age Black Canary is fantastic female solo character and just plain fun. I'm surprised Wonder Woman took off with this kind of competition!)Golden Age Spectre is nutty, borderline insane, great art to look at, and is the most ""out-there"" of the DC offerings. That's what's so great about it. He's creepy. He's dead. He wears a hooded cape and panties. LOL.Interested in the DC Archive Editions? Start your collection with this one. You'll be hooked."
5,Archive Editions-DC Rules,"The DC Archives are a great way for a comic fan to ""read"" the books, which you cannot do with the originals either because of scaricity or ""fear"" of damaging the original through handling.I have been ""replacing"" my collection with Archive Editions and look forward to new releases and continuing the process."
5,Ice Free Bird Bath,"This is a high quality product. In this day and age of inferior ""cheap"" goods, this one is not part of that group. Rugged construction, well thought design, and using an economical 200-watts on a thermostat too, makes this a 5-star product.Birds have a hard time finding a good water source during the coldest months, and providing an un-frozen bird bath is a sure way to earn points with your wild birds. Even though the water in your bird bath should be changed daily, keep an eye on your bath in the winter because this will cause the water to evaporate quickly (I would estimate 3/4-in in a day).You will be pleased with this heater.And, it is made right here in the USA!"
5,The birds love it.,"The heater works very well, and it is easy to adjust the cord bracket to any type bath. The water doesn't freeze in the coldest weather, and it turns off over 40 degrees."
1,good service,"unfortunately i cannot review the actual product as it did not work, however the return was no hassle at all..since i wanted a bird bath heater soon i went to a local store and bought one..and Murphys Law was engaged...that one didn't work either! it was not a Nelson brand ( entirely different style as well)..i finally returned that one as well and got one that worked. i would not hesitate to buy from dealer again because there was no hassle in returning the item."
4,This birdbath heater works!,"Most pleased with this heater. It fits my birdbath, has the right length cord, and is keeping the water from freezing. It is similar in design to my previous heater which lasted more than fifteen years. I expect this one will do as well."
5,Bird Bath Heater,"Works great, just be careful not to let the water level get too low.Nelson 6200 Gulf Stream Bird Bath Heater and De-Icer"
4,"STATEMENT BY THE AUTHOR, JOHN F. MURPHY, JR.","I hereby publicly disavow the information in the review by Mr. Arthur John Kyriazis. I have never portrayed myself as a ""Professional Inteliligence officer,"" nor have I ever claimed access to ""top secret"" information. To proclaim myself as a ""Professional Intelligence officer"" would be to do a disservice to those who have been. To claim that I had access to ""top secret"" information would be to claim access to information that I do not---nor have ever---possessed. I do not know from whom Mr. Kyriazis gained his information, but it was not from me. John F. Murphy, Jr."
2,Unfocused,"I will just echo the sentiment of the Publishers Weekly review. It looks like a decent book in the store, and the inner cover is promising. There is a complete lack of focus, however, and unless you are a historian (ie. professor) this is difficult and cumbersome reading; I wish I had visited this site before buying it. Many of the sentences seem awkward, as if directly quoted form other sources. A good educator provides illumination and insight into historical events, within a synthesis of thought; this is merely a list of historical events in haphazard order."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I bought this book thinking that it would broaden my exposure to this important topic, but I couldn't even finish it. In my opinion, it was very poorly written. The topics jumped around frequently, and even the ""transitions"" didn't even flow. I didn't learn anything from this book, and saw what I thought were many inconsistencies in the information being presented. An example is whether or not the author was going to make up his mind that Russia and China were state sponsors of terrorism, or targets of terrorism. It would have been fine to present that as part of a complex argument in a world that is not black and white, but it was as if the author was passionately arguing both sides without recognizing the multifacted realpolitik involved."
1,Not the best book on islamic extreamism.,"The author does have much factual information in the book, but he paints Islam as a religion of nothing but extreamists(IN MY HUMBLE OPINION). He grasps at straws in some parts of the book trying to link certain terrorist groups together. He even suggests that it is likely that Al Queada and HIzbollah cells in South America will team up with Marxist groups like the Columbian FARRC and Neo Nazi groups to attack America. While this is not impossible it is grasping at straws and when he talks about these (Marxist) groups in some detail it gets off track of the books intended subject matter(Fundmetalist Militant Islam)."
2,Not what I expected,"This product is a disappointment because powerwasher makes really good products. The water outlet is aluminum and not brass. The inlet is plastic and not brass. Because it is plastic, the inlet water pressure cannot exceed 80 to 100 psi. I have strong water pressure where I live and it exceeds this requirement. I wish they would have put it on the product description because I had to return it for this reason. I am going to probably get the 1600psi or the 1750psi that can handle a high inlet pressure. Powerwasher does make great products, just not this one."
1,piece of junk,Ditto what Mr. Harte said. The first hose leaked like crazy after less that 6 months use. The over-priced replacement is doing the exact same thing. Design flaw. Should be recalled. I will never buy from this company again.
1,Giant Piece of Crap.,"Bought it last year, probably used it all of 5 times at the most. Stored it in basement incase there was any water in it, so it would not freeze. First attempt to use it this year, and the gun is hemorraging water all over the place. Replacement gun is almost half of what I paid for it originally. Save your money, or go for something not quite as cheaply made."
1,Dont Buy This.,"Its not what I thought it would be. Much smaller than you think. How does it work? Danged if I know. Mine came WITHOUT a wand. After 9 emails, 8 days, 2 reference numbers, talking to 3 different people, am still waiting for my wand from the company."
1,don't waste your money,Only used it a few times and now it won't turn on. Initial trouble shooting indicates a bad switch. I'm very disappointed in this product.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!! Would not recommend!,"Hello. My husband and I recieved our Powerwasher as a gift on 6/6/2010. This morning, we hooked up our Powerwasher 1300 PSI to begin using it on our paver patio. We were dissapointed to see when we opened our box that the black hose that connects the powerwasher wand to the machine had torn in 5 different places, exposing white material under the black hose. We registered the product online, and I tried to access the online chat, which was unsuccessful. We waited for 10 minutes and no one responded, which was very frustruating. We are asking for the reciept to take this product back!!! I would not recommend!"
4,"Good price, does the job","I received an order confirmation same day, and the charger arrived quickly. This is a very basic charger, no bells and whistles, but I don't really need anything more fancy. You put the battery in, the light starts flashing indicating it is charging, then goes to a steady light when it is done. It is listed as a 1 hour charger, but seems to take more like 2-3 hours. That is probably more because my battery is getting old, and not because of the charger. This is compatible with 7.2 v and 14.4 v. It was very inexpensive and works just fine."
1,Dead on arrival,Did not even work. Not my batteries (3 of them and one new). I am very disappointed and must return the item.
5,DeWalt Battery Charger,"I am very pleased with the vendor of this product. The item was new and very well packaged. It arrived in a very timely manner and in perfect condition. It was well-presented on the website. I will definitely buy from this vendor again! As always, Amazon and their selected vendors, rule!"
4,Great for display!,"Overall, this product will do a great collection piece for any LOTR / JRR Tolkien fan. I actually use them as decoration for my cubicle at my job, and most people stands by and comment.Yet, consider this for display, not as a toy for properly playing, since they won't take the usage and survive. Bases, arms and weapons can fall off if played with. Consider as well these are very rare and no longer produced.I'm taking one star off since for the price I would expect them to be more carefully painted and cutted, but you won't notice unless you stare closely at them."
3,Good...but I was confused....,"I think this CD is beautiful. It reminds me of an Italian Restaurant I used to frequent. However, I was confused by the title. I thought that because the title was 40 Favorite Italian Melodies, and because there were 40 songs listed individually on the back, there would be 40 songs to listen to. However the CD only plays 13. I am not sure if all forty songs have been combined or not. Either way, this CD is worth the price."
5,Johnny Moeller's Three Gifts,"Johnny Moeller's exceptional talent with the guitar is exceeded by two of his other talents on this CD: 1) Song selection and 2) Guest musician selection for his aggregation. These three ingredients combine to make this CD rock with a 50's feel to it. Simply stated, there is magic in this CD, and it takes me back to another time... everytime."
1,Asleep at the Sewing Machine,"Although the design is appropriately cute enough, this particular item has one serious flaw: the nose piece is REALLY crooked. I didn't expect perfect symmetry from a stuffed animal. Some sewing errors give them a unique charm. What I did expect, however, was for the seller to avoid selling blatantly defective merchandise. The only positive thing I can take away from this transaction is that the misfit toy disappointed only me, and not a child."
5,Fantastic Product,"Paul Mitchell has a ""Real Winner"" with this product!!!!I have colored & permed hair & this product really makes a difference in repairing damaged hair. Hair feels soft & ""Healthy"" after just one quick usage. Hate that ""frizz"" after a perm...well this product takes that away!!!My best friend has a normal ""frizz"" to her hair that she hates. Gave her a tube of this & she couldn't believe the great results. Now she is just as ""Hooked"" on this product as I am."
5,Letter opener,I purchased this for my 91 year old father... Very useful to him for opening his mail. Easy for him to hold on to.
4,Southern Bus Boy,"I have been wanting to open a restaurant for several years now. I work in a seafood restaurant in a northern Mississippi town, and I don't know, I guess serving people is just in my blood.I am a big Howard Cannon fan. I do wish that the book was a little more detailed, but I believe he really loves the business. If you want to open a restaurant, buy this book.I'd also recommend Running a Restaurant for Dummies."
5,Good book,"My students loved this story! They enjoyed learning about the different homes for animals and people. Also, good for teaching rhyming words"
3,A House is a House for Me,I read A House is a House for me by Mary Ann Hoberman. The book has a lot of homes in it. Home of animals and other kinds too. I only liked the pictures and the ryhming parts. It was not so exciting. I think little kids would like it.
5,One of best children's books of all time,"Excellent, creative concept. Natural, sing-songy rhymes that are not forced or cheesy. Amazing illustrations-you could talk about each page for hours if you wanted to (or not). Lots of vocabulary words to learn. Artists, writers and lovers of language will all love it. One of my favorite books as a kid growing up in the 80s. I've since bought if for my own daughter and 3 or 4 of her friends as birthday gifts (3rd bday but definitely suitable for MANY years to come)..."
3,cute but way too long,"The story is good, for the first 10 pages, but it just goes on and on and on. It is way too long and could easily cut out 10 pages without missing anything. I love how it starts out, so maybe instead of giving it away, I may just cut out a bunch of pages."
4,Really cute book!,"I am not so much a fan of the illustrations in this book, but I love the way the book reads. It introduces all kinds of animal houses as well as slightly more abstract ideas like boxes being houses for crackers. The words rhyme and flow beautifully. Definitely great for toddler story time. It may be a bit on the long side for some, but it keeps my 2 year old entertained and he asks for it by name!"
4,Nasty Girl,"Single number five from the princesses of R&B. This is a R&B smash with biting lyrics. The album version can be found on their 2001 album release ""Survivor"". The Azza's Nu Soul Mix can be found on their recent remix compilation album ""This Is The Remix"" and the Maurice's Nu Soul Remix Radio Edit is the dance version that accompanies the video. All in all, three fine versions of one damn fine song. This is the German version of the CD single which also features the video. For die hard fans, an Australian version of the CD is also available. Tracklisting is identical except that in replacement of the enhanced video, track number four is the Big Boyz Remix of ""Bootylicious""."
2,Hypocrites,"The theme of this song has been done several times, but never by women so scantily-clad as these. On it's own, the song is catchy and the theme is certainly one I agree with. However, Destiny's Child should stick to catchy songs with themes that don't contradict themselves.(And since Beyonce is the lead singer, I would like to point a specific finger at her and ask, ""What about Naughty Girl?"")"
1,Missing Volume Control,"I didn't even get to try these speakers out. The on/off/volume control was missing in the box. Also, there is a warning sticker on the bottom of the sub stating that there is no magnetic field protection around the unit. So I guess you really shouldn't place them too close to your computer?????Well, mine are being returned, no replacement for me.I will look for another brand, probably Altec Lansing."
2,Didn't like it.,"I bought this and all the subwoofer would put out was a Thump sound for the bass-lines. No real tone, just a thump. I took it back for a logitech x220 and I am much happier.This also has one other HUGE problem. When I opened the box there was a sticker on the subwoofer stating that there is no magnetic field protection around the unit. Don't set it near hard drives, disks, tapes, etc. That worried me and was the other reason I returned it."
5,"A straightforward, sensible, ""user friendly"" primer","Writing The Action-Adventure Film: The Moment Of Truth by professional screenwriter Neill D. Hicks (""Rumble in the Bronx""; ""First Strike"") is a straightforward, sensible, ""user friendly"" primer for creating a solid screenplay specifically for one of the most popular movie genres in America. Individual chapters specifically address issues of characterization, plot structure, pitfalls, and the strengths of the Action-Adventure film genre, as well as what the audience expects when they go to see the latest action movie. If you are contemplating, or already involved in, scripting an Action-Adventure screenplay, then give Neill Hicks' Writing The Action-Adventure Film an immediate and careful reading."
2,coconut shell moon earrings,"These were cheaply priced and cheaply made. One of the coconut moons fell off the earring hook as I removed it from the shipping container. I've tried to put it back together for wearing, but the one time I did wear it, the moon fell off again within an hour of putting them on. They are pretty, but probably not worth the price."
1,Dissent is nothing compared to Christianity...,"Next I would like the author to write a similar history of dissent amongst the Christian religious groups in the world today from Roman Catholicism to born-again christians to Lutherans, to the Church of England.I see nothing different about people.Whether they are Jews or Christians, Muslims or Hindus, Buddhists or Sufi, people will always disagree, they will always see things from their perspective, and there will always be dissent even amongst members of the same church or same parish.The challenge that the author fails to address is how any religion can avoid fractious politics. If in fact it can; if humanity can."
3,Needs more...,"I disagree with the many reviews which compare this text to White's Human Osteology. While there is no doubt that the text is informative and the treatment of the subject thorough, Scheuer's text lacks enough illustrations to make it worth the buy for practical use in identifying fragmented juvenile or infant remains. White's text provides at least one photo and description of each bone, usually from every angle. When Scheuer releases a second addition, with far less text, and more photos or illustrations for osteologists who do not have access to a skeletal collection of juvenile and infant bones, then it will be worth the buy."
1,"Do not let the word ""computer"" throw you.","There are no computer disks with this book and therefore there is no checking of what you have typed as you go through the lessons. You are just typing from the book and, if you are typing correctly, you are looking at the book and not at the screen. Therefore, as you make mistakes you are not aware of them. This book and method were good 20 years ago, when there were no computers, but they are way out of pace now.The author needs to update this book with a disk that lets you know when you make a missteak. Yeah, that's right."
4,Exactly what I was hoping for!,"I took typing in high school, and i wanted to find a book to teach my 11 year old how to type (we homeschool online). I remembered the typing books from high school ""a s d f, j k l ;"" and that's exactly what i was looking for...and I found it in this book! Not only that, but it also has great computer skills to go along with the typing aspect. she is already learning and I'm so grateful that I bought this."
5,Computer Students Learn Quickly from Book,I am teaching a group of adults computer keyboarding for the workplace. This is by far the best book for the task. The excercises are practical. The spiral bound book makes an excellent desktop companion.
4,Typing book,"nice, easy to follow typing book for both those just starting out and for those who need refreshening"
1,Watch out for the fuzz!,"I bought one of these cases a couple of years ago. It has more space than most others, and is a very good price. Unfortunately, I started having reeds ""go dead"" pretty often, and I couldn't figure out why. Then I met another harp player and he saw my case and said, ""I used to have one like that, but little pieces of the felt come off and get stuck in the reeds and they don't play."" I can carry them in my pocket and abuse them, and they still play, but when I kept them in this box, the reeds went dead. So, I don't think any ""felt lined"" case is good. Buy one with foam or leather inside."
4,Don't expect any accessories,"This guitar is cute, and my daughter is thrilled to have it. However, it's supposed to be for kids who are just learning, and it came with absolutely no help whatsoever. No pick, no instructions on tuning, not even a little beginner songbook to get a child started. It's a guitar in a box. I've had to search online, call local music shops and ask friends just so she can use this guitar for its intended purpose. She thinks its great, but Mom's pretty disappointed."
2,Get What Ya Pay For,So I got this guitar today for my friends 4 year old. Right out of the box I noticed paint chipping off the design. The tuning peg holes look like they were carved out with a dull knife or possibly a pen. The frets are pretty sloppy as well. Regardless of its bad manufacturing I wanted to hear how it sounds. It was not pre-tuned. I busted out my tuner and went to work. All was well until I relized that when you tune one string the last one tuned goes out of tune. This is because of a lack of a truss bar (which keeps the neck from bowing). My intentions were to teach this child how to play a guitar. Not to give her another annoying toy. Spend the extra cash and get a youth size Gibson or something comparable. If your kid is serious about playing don't cheap out like when you bought that Hyundai instead of the Honda.
4,Step by step instruction,Easy to read and understand. With exercises at the end of each chapter. Helps with synthesizing your research.
5,Andy Griffith Show - 1st Season,Gave a gift to someone that loves the Andy Griffith Show. They were very happy with the quality of the DVD!
5,andy griffith,I have loved the Andy Griffith Show since I was a little girl. Thank you Amazon for making these videos available. It's too bad the sitcoms of today aren't nearly as funny as the old ones.
4,One of the timeless tv comedies,"I will not try to discribe the characters, I doubt there is anyone in the country that has not seen the show at least a few times.The best comedy is simply exaggerated real life. And that is exactly what this is, the stories that you would find in any smalltown blown out of proportion just enough to make them funny.The series is charming and funny. And gets better as it goes along. I`m giving the 1st season 4 stars instead of 5 because inthe 1st season they struggled a bit to find their footing. But by the 2nd season they had hit their stride, knew exactly wherethey were going with the show, and went full steam ahead and into classic tv history.These shows are just as funny today as the were nearly 50 years ago."
5,One of the best shows ever on TV - A true classic.,Oh what a wonderful show this was. The characters are classic and loveable. The DVD quality was very good and for the price you can't beat it. The shear volume of shows is worth the price. If you like the Andy Griffith show or just want to get a feel for classic TV watch this DVD. It beats all of the junk on TV today. As a matter of fact I canceled my cable subscription and with the money I save each month I buy DVD's. No more searching endlessly through hundreds of channels to try and find something good to watch. I get to watch all of the shows I like without those annoying commercials. I can pause to go get something to eat or go to the rest room and start from where I left off. You can't beat that.
5,"No commercials, Yahoo!","The early Andy Griffith seasons take me back to when life took it's good old time. I can't find much on T.V. nowadays except junk. Yuk! The best thing about these seasons (and especially Barney!) is NO COMMERCIALS. Yahoo! I'm seeing wonderful, funny scenes I've never seen before (scenes which were cut to allow for those endless strings of commercials . . . scenes which add flavor to each show.) These heartwarming episodes are a nice way to spend time with family, friends, or even when alone, while having a good laugh.Happy viewing!Bonnie B. Tilly (Fallbrook, CA)"
5,Best ever!!,"I can't believe I waited so long to buy this! Once I finally did I savored every episode. Other reviewers refer to some of the following seasons as the best, but there are some really good things to like about the first season. For one thing, it's so fresh and new. I also think Opie is great. After seeing him so young it's hard to picture him as a 10-year-old! I laugh every episode, and since I bought the show for the episodes I do not mind that there aren't any extras. My favorite episodes are ""Opie's Charity,"" ""Ellie for Council,"" and ""Ellie Saves a Female""--although all of them are great. What a fantastic show!!"
5,The Andy Griffith Show-The Complete First Season,The best DVD collection of the Andy Griffith show I've found. Picture and sound are great and the episodes are uncut. I look forward to the release of the next set.
5,The best of the best,"What better way is there to learn about being a parent and friend then by watching Andy treat life like it matters. Even when he is wrong and makes poor judgement calls, he is able to say he is sorry. Oh how I wish he had been my father and then my friend. Greatest show that ever aired, sorry, but once Barney left, sob, I grieved he allowed us to see Andy at his kindest. It was Andy that taught us to care more others before we care about ourselves. Hummmmm...sounds familiar?"
5,"Why Not Include the ""Pilot"" Episode from Danny Thomas?","A ""pilot"" episode was done on an episode of The Danny Thomas Show. I saw it once, years ago. It's very interesting, and it's a shame it wasn't included as a bonus feature on this DVD set. I wish the people who put these DVD sets together, would care enough to include things like this. [Similarly, episodes of Homicide: Life on the Streets that were crossover episodes with Law and Order, only have the Homicide episodes on their DVD season box sets. Rather frustrating.]"
5,long time fans will love it,"I have been a fan since the show first came out. I religously watched and TAPED all the reruns.Now I can throw them out because this is the ultimate collection. All the ending's are intact, the picture is beautiful, the sound excellant. I have already watched the entire four discs and am anxiously wiating for the rest of the releases.They left in evey line including the ""I think he's growing marijuana"" in the ""Quiet Sam"" episode. Its all there."
5,Accents make the show,"As to the comment about the thick accents, Andy's is real, Gomer's is real. Even the Rafe Hollister actor's is real (being from Shreveport, LA).The ""trying too hard, Gone-With-the-Wind imitation"" Southern accent is used by all the non-southern actors and actresses. Not that it is bothersome. They just all seem to think that the South has one dialect.As the seasons go by, you can tell Andy ""refines"" his accent, unfortunately. He should have kept his accent intact. That was part of his charm and wit."
3,Good show but very inconsistent,"Barney Fife has three different middle names: P., Milton, and Oliver. Clara Edwards is also known as Clara Johnson. Goober Pyle was once Goober Beasley. Dozens of other inconsistencies abound. I'm saying that with all the digitilization on DVD today they should be able to edit so many of these innacuarcies out. Including the innacuaracy in the first ep or two when it's mentioned that Barney and Andy are cousins (a fact forgotten for nearly the rest of the show)."
5,It's About Time,"Anyone who collects television shows on DVD knows that buying releases by season is the only true way to ensure that every episode is in your collection. For years, I've seen small, random sets of Andy Griffith Show episodes, and I've dreamed of the time when I could collect my all-time favorite show by season. To my delight, the time is now. The season one four-disc set consists of four slimline cases in a collection box -- a nice touch. Each disc contains eight episodes, and there are absolute classics on each disc. The ""Play All"" feature allows you to view them all at once. In complete fairness, I wish the set included the pilot featured on ""Make Room for Daddy."" Additional features/commentaries would be welcomed too. The chapter marks are a little too far apart for my taste, but that is a minor issue. For all Andy/Opie/Barney fans, this is a MUST have!!!"
4,Family Funtime,"It's nice to finally have something the whole family can enjoy-this is an oft heard phrase when film companies are promoting their latest 'family' film but unfortunately much of the 'family' movies are geared toward kids and leaves adults out or is too dramatic for younger kids or too silly, etc. but this series is great because there's something for everyone. My 10, 8, & 6 year olds love it and even my 2 year old gets into the music that frequently accompany's the show in various forms. It's funny, lighthearted, and genuine. And a breath of fresh air after all the stuffy repeats of modern comedy."
5,andy griffith 1st season,Excellent and well-written; the episodes are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were in 1960.
5,Andy Griffith CD,"The Andy Griffith show is one of my all-time favorites. Even though I have seen every episode multiple times, it still makes the laugh out loud. Great for the kids, too!"
5,frekzanatcha,The Frekzanatcha always have the best performances. I love to see them open at shows they always have the best performance. I cannot wait until a COS CD comes out I will be the first to buy it.
1,Deserves Zero Stars,"A Customer formerly known as An Electronics Fan tried this GE (Jasco) Ultra Prograde Digital Optical Cable AV22684. This cheapest optical I could find cost me wasted time and money. The Monster Digital Interlink LightSpeed 100 Cable solved the problem. The Monster Cable transmits several times greater intensity light than this limp, weak, cheap GE cable."
1,It is a cheap cable that fails to work,This cable did not work between my Creative SoundBlaster Live! 5.1 sound card and my Logitech Z-680 speakers system. I tried everything but finally I figured out that the fact that I have no sound is because of the cable. It is a low-quality cheap cable.
1,Misleading name,"The name ""Lanyard With Ring, 34"" Long, 24/BX, Black (BAU69309) Category: Lanyards"" lead me to believe that there were 24 per Box ... ""24/BX"" but you only get one. Scam tactics."
4,A great fifth record.,"This is going to be the third time I've written this review (because Amazon wouldn't post it due to my use of their band name), so I'll keep it short:This new album is better produced and recorded than Conduct, etc., and the songwriting is just as good. Conduct is probably just slighty better, but it's still well worth a listen. Still mellow as hell.And for those of you who are just here because of the band's name, trust me...they're for real."
3,Great song but disappointed with the packaging,"Like others, I was misled into thinking this was a CD of remixes. It isn't. The live tracks are wonderful though. I'm glad Annie and Dave are able to successfully re-invent such classics as ""Here Comes the Rain Again."""
2,Not the remix I was looking for.,"Initially when I posted my review, I had assumed that a great remix was being offered on this single. I was damn wrong. I now have the remix I was looking for (2 remixes actually). They are both great. Drop me a line if you'd like to hear them."
2,"OK, But not breaking news...","If you're new to Access/VBA development, this book will be a good reference. If you've been developing Access apps for a few years, there's not much in here you haven't already figured out for yourself."
5,NC Double YAY!,"The finest college football game ever. The pageantry of all 117 D-I teams awesome running game, and random button pusher beware... it takes brains to pass effectively this year... so yes the short outs and button hooks are now staples of my west coast/ option attack... this game rules.Hint: especially on higher difficulty levels... recruit speed especially on defence its the difference between allowing 10 yard completions and repeatedly hearing Brad Nessler say: ""He's gonna take this one all the way to the Barn!!!!"""
3,"Great game, but still room for improvement","First of all let me say the game is great. Good graphics, and a real college feel to the gameplay. My favorite part is the comprehensive dynasty mode.However, some problems I encountered with the game, the commentary gets old really quick. Also I dont know what they used to rank teams but no way can Marshall end up being #1 and Washington State #2 in a season which is what happened after playing one year in dynasty mode. Both Miami, Florida and OU lost only 1 game but yet they are far more deserving to being in the National Championship game than Marshall. I also have some complaints about the Heisman trophy and how they give out awards.But these are only somethings hardcore gamers and true college fans will notice, otherwise you'll love this game."
5,UPS can't ship it fast enough,"The 2002 version has resided in my PS2 for approximately 99% of the time. The other 1% taken by Superfly. What I enjoy most about the EA line is the statistics. After reading everyone's review of the 2003 version, UPS can't ship my copy fast enough.I do hope the commentary has been overhauled since Brad, Lee, & Kirk's comments have worn thin.I also hope they have the teams (I'm thinking of the WA Huskies in particular) run onto the field from their locker room and not the parking lot.Oh, and why have the Oregon QB on the cover in '03 when he's no longer a college player??"
1,TOO EASY,"THE ONLY THING THAT MADE THE GAME HARD WERE THE CONTROLS , I FOUND MYSELTH FALLING ASLEEP WHILE PLAYING THE GAME."
5,THE BEST COLLEGE GAME EVER,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAMES EVER. THE BEST PLAY IS A FLEAFLICKER IS WHEN YOU FAKE RUN WITH THE QUARTERBACK AND JUST ABOUT WHEN THE QUARTERBACK GETS HIT U TOSS IT TO THE RUNNINGBACK. ITS SURELY TO GET U THIRTY TO FOURTY YARDS. IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH U CAN GET A TOUCHDOWN. I LIKE WHEN YOUR RUNNING AND THE ANNOUNCER IS SAYING TO THE 30,20,10,5 TOUCHDOWN! THATS PREETY MUCH IT. I THINK U SHPULD GET IT U WILL ENJOY IT!"
5,#1 Football Game of the year,"Create your own; team, player, jersey's, pick your team's fight song, pick your conference, theres only one thing that this game needs...better graphics.In creating your own team it gets so detailed...what your belt color is, shoe color, jersey style...all the little details are in there. After you make the team, you get to pick who your school rival is...you better make it UNC...cause UNC rules!!!In creating your own player, you pick every little tiny detail from, how tall to what your head size is...its mad crazy!!! They made this game so realistic....you even get drafted and win the Heisman Trophy....It's a must get game!!!! its worth every penny!!! You'd be crazy not to get it!!!!"
4,"The Best,!!! but Freezes","This game is better then Madden 2003! It is the best football game I have ever played. It is true that it will freeze at times. The play by play will stop and then the game freezes, and your out of luck. This doesnt happen often, but it happens enough that long pauses in commentary are noticed. Since the PS2 has just gone online maybe, but most likly not; they can make a patch for it?? EA are you listening?"
5,Pretty Awesome,"I've played a little madden (2005,pc), and a little ncaa (99,ps, long time ago), and I have to say this beats all so far. The graphics are pretty stunning (I have component cables, really helps). Better than madden 05 in my opinion. I love college football, and it's the offseason, so anything that let's me play as my huskers and beat the crap outta the sooners or longhorns is awesome. I was impressed with dynasty (it's the first time I tried something like that so I can't compare it with anything). Unfortunately, the PS2 still has the slowest memory bus EVER. It takes a long time to load dynasty games and even longer to save. But that's how it is for most ps2 games, so it doesn't really detract from this one specifically. Overall, good game. I picked it up for a dollar at gamestop, so it's been well worth it."
4,Now hold on.,"... NCAA Football 2003 is one of the best football games ever made. There are tons of options to mess around with that will keep your Saturday college football fever run throughout the weekend and well in to the next week.This is the type of football game that reminds you why you love the genre of games in the first place.Plus, nothing beats hearing the roar of the college trombones when you enter the stadium!"
2,FRUSTRATION!,"I too am having ""freezing"" problems with this game. Although it seems to be the best football game I've ever played, there seems to be a glitch with it...exactly the same problem as another review on this site. Announcers stop narrating and game freezes after pushing the ""X"" or ""START"" buttons. I was able to play a total of 20 games then suddenly, this problem arose. The freezing occurs EVERYTIME I play a game...even in practice. My guess is there is a bug in the game and hopefully, EA Sports will fix it soon. Suggestion: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL YOU'RE SURE THE GLITCH HAS BEEN FIXED!"
4,NCAA Football 2003,"Ok lets me first start by saying i never liked EA sports game to begin with, there not as realistic as Sega sport games. Id have to say though ive played NCAA football 2003, and think they've done a great job improving the games graphics, the running backs dont run like they have lead in their shoes, they can actually cut in between the defenders, and the defense can put serious hits on the offense in this game. The only thing I disliked was the offense play selection...its extremely hard to throw the ball in this game, the wide recievers routes are repeatative and dont fake out anyone, but the quarterback."
5,Best Sports Game to date!,"I'm a big Sega sports guy, but this game is better than any other sports game I ever played. Don't get Madden 2003, that game is horrible, this game is way better."
3,"Decent game, but still not flawless","I would like to start by saying this is a well designed game. The graphics are spectacular and the A.I. is rather well created. However, don't be fooled into thinking it is anywhere near perfect. The game is full of bugs and rather annoying ones at that. For instance, I started a dynasty with Colorado. A heavy underdog going to Texas for an important Big 12 game. Opening kickoff, I nail the returner and he fumbles and I recover. However there was a Texas holding penalty called. Both options, accept or decline, gave Texas the ball back, so I chose to accept it. This created another problem, not only did Texas get the ball back, they got it on my 10 yard line instead of theirs!!! Therefore, instead of me getting the ball on the 10 and almost guaranteeing a score, Texas gets the ball in the red zone!! Terrible. At first sight I thought EA did a great job, but it seems that a perfect college football game will have to wait for another year."
3,Thinner than expected,"The file flap felt a lot floppier and thin than I had anticipated it would be, and the rope that holds it together is also a little looser than I had expected. (Those tend to loosen over time, but the way it came doesn't feel that secure). In addition, the inner pockets are a little small and don't hold nearly as much as I hoped they would. There's just not that much expansion in the file, which hinders how much space you have for papers in addition to how much browsing space you have to look at your files while they're in there.It's still a nice way of organizing files, I just wish it stretched out a little more."
5,Durable and Elegant,"I have had Visions cookware for about 17 years I guess. One of them has broken, but I loved them for all the years I've had them. They are great on gas stoves. They are great on electric stoves. I caution you to use low heat levels. High liquid items are no trouble. Baking is no trouble. If I burned something in one of them, I used a metal spatula to gently and carefully remove most of the charred crud, and then some cleanser or SOS to make them look like new again. I am looking to replace my beloved and well used 5 quart that had a coffee cup tossed into it by one of the kiddies :). I really like this cookware."
4,close to the real thing,It isn't quite Vance but not bad at all -Cudgel is my favorite character ever and it was great to see his adventures continue - I can't imagine a Vance fan not liking this book
4,Shape Up the Easy Way,"Weight Watchers' Easy Shape-up series is a great way to work your way back into shape or to begin getting into shape. The Lower Body Workout is fun and easy to follow. The tape includes a warm-up, a 20 minute aerobic session, a cool down, and specific excerises for the lower body. The instructions of the trianer are easy to follow. Participants can choose the intensity of their workout. The tape allows for check points of your intensity throughout the workout. Overall, this workout series is one of my favorites."
5,Wonderful Man and Book,"I have had the pleasure of knowing Robert Goodman personally for more years than I can count. He is an excellent writer and I say this not as someone who knows him personally but as a reader who appreciates his style and sincerity. Robert has the same warmth and kindness in life as he shows in his writing. ""Through the Eyes of Santa"" is a heartfelt labor of love from Robert and I highly recommend it to everyone regardless of your religious background or your ethnic links. You will not be disappointed."
4,A dancer's delight,"Although at first glance I was disappointed that the dancing is not strictly belly dancing, this is a great DVD especially for those interested in belly dance history. We can see how the U.S. has influenced the interpretation of belly dancing in the mid-east and we see why Samia had great appeal in North America. I've especially enjoyed Samia's arm movements and other subtle moves that will surely help me in improving my dance."
3,Not as powerfull as canned air.,"I have come across devices like these in the past, and they were all terrible and didn't really blow air at all to do anything with. This one is the best one I have found to date, however, it still doesn't come close to canned air dusters.This is being advertised as a replacement for canned air, but you will still need canned air, this is not as good."
3,doesn't work in Australia,"I didn't even think about it so really its my fault, but I live in Australia now and this doesn't work here."
5,Crocodile dundee Triple feature,GREAT movie!!!! I have friends that want to buy this movie too!!! Cant wait to add it to movie watching.
4,great value for a dvd collection,bought this for my husband and he thoroughly enjoyed this.he's a huge dundee fan. was easier than buying them separately.
5,3x the Crocodiles,"Bought this for my 90 yr. old dad who was looking for the first two but neither of us could find them. When I found the Triple Feature on Amazon, I was delighted - and he loves it. The DVD Came within just a few days and was able to surprise dad. I have used Amazon twice since then, I use Amazon every Christmas, and will continue to do so."
4,A Must for any Crocodile Dundee Fan,"If you love the character, or got a thing for Paul Hogan (as my gf does), you need this boxset. I grew up watching this movie so it holds a special place in my heart. Great comedy contrasts with fun, family feel. The sequels were OK (very few trilogies get the third one right), but frankly, this isn't going to win an oscar. It's all about the absurdity of Dundee's antics and Hogan is on point throughout."
5,Great family comedy,"This set of dvd's is a laugh riot. Paul Hogan is hilarious. I have not seen these movies for a long time & I'm glad i got them for my family to enjoy too. I didnt even know they had a 3rd movie. If you want good, clean, family comedy, this is it. This product shipped on time & in good condition."
4,crocodile Dundee tripled pack,Great triple pack! Gotta love Dundee! Start with the first an go all the way to third movie great family movie! A must watch for the family! !!
4,Crocodile Dundee The complete series,My husband and I have watched these movies more than once. They are great. I will recommend themCrocodile Dundee Triple Feature (Crocodile Dundee / Crocodile Dundee II / Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles)
4,Good traveloge for Australia,Paul Hogan did a good job showing off his country. Lots of fun but glad that he did not try to make anymore than three movies.
1,Great description,"When searching for and item and finding this one, I know exactly what I am getting when I order this item. I know all about the manufaturer, their sucess and.... damn, I don't know the diameter, the construiction material or anyhting really other than it is a jaw slide. Based on the product description I sure hope you sell lots of these."
4,Nearly Perfect Longhair,"This CD appears to have a factory defect. For a review of the music, see others' comments. Briefly, the CD is a wonderful companion to ROUNDER's ""Houseparty New Orleans Style"", which offers rareties culled from the same sessions as this CD. PROBLEM[!]: I purchased my CD from Amazon because the copy I already owned had a skip in it. In the Fats Domino Medley - during ""Going To The River"", there is a brief skip. Fess sings ""The Rain/Rain is falling..."". There was some surface damage on my CD, so I took it to a local record shop, they fixed the surface scratches, but the same skip remained. When I received my ""like new"" CD from Amazon, which has NO surface damage, the EXACT SAME SKIP appears. Does anyone have a ""Mardi Gras In Baton Rouge"" CD on which this skip does NOT exist?"
5,Loved the illustrations!,"This book is truly adorable. However, the illustrations are what make it so special! I loved how whimsical and fun they are!"
2,"Cute, but ... meh.","Not the most profound read. The drawing is simple, the text is basic and only mildly humorous. This is the sort of book you'd find a stack of in a remainder store. The best thing I can say about it is that it's ""cute"". Appropriate for regifting or yard sales."
1,Rip Off,"I hate to be a party pooper, but this book seemed like it took about a half hour to write and another half-hour to illustrate. The other thing is that it really isn't all that funny, although it tries really hard. Not worth the money."
1,boycott this ripoff,"This track rips off DJ Rolando's internationally famous techno anthem ""Jaguar"" (also available at this site, and a far superior piece of music, to boot). It has not been legally licensed from UR, which receives no publishing credits nor royalties for it. I find it ironic that major labels cry foul about file-sharing when piracy seems to be business as usual for them."
2,Ignition Module Tester?,"Well...I ran out and bought this module tester after my mechanic assured me my module was at fault for a misfire. Opening the box and reading the manual of this tester revealed a rather huge caveat: MODULE TESTER IS ONLY FOR USE ON DEAD MODULES. It will confirm your module is dead. This means that if your car WON'T START this unit will tell you whether it is the module or not but it will NOT reveal if their is an intermittent problem with the module.Hey, this is not all bad but it doesn't help me at all with my misfire.In the end I'm keeping it anyway but I wish they would have mentioned that BIG detail upfront."
3,not as good as some of Kaplan's other works,"This book is a collection of Kaplan's earlier essays; I suspect that he had not reached his intellectual peak at the time he wrote them. Some of Kaplan's essays, such as the one on extraterrestial life, are as interesting as the other reviewer thinks. Others struck me as dry and lifeless, as if Kaplan was just mechanically stringing together others' thoughts."
5,favorite blankie,i looked everywhere before i found a blanket with the silkie edges. when i found this one i knew it was the one i wanted for my son. he loves it and i always know when nap or bed time is because he will come to me dragging the blankie behind. i will definatly buy another one for my second baby we are just waiting to see if the blanket needs to be blue or pink.
5,best blanket ever,I'm a NICU nurse and one of the preemies had one of these blankets. She slept best on this blanket and was always so comfortable. I was pregnant when I took care of her and I received this blanket as a gift. My baby sleeps best with this blanket and prefers it over all others. Even her brother tries to steal this blanket. This blanket is soooo soft and the silk edging is slippery soft too. I'm buying more so we don't have to worry about not having one when doing laundry etc.
1,Don't waste your money,"Never buy these things. they tell you nothing about them before you buy them, and then require you download a volumne of pages which eliminate just about everything that could happen. Purchase carefully, always from Amazon, they warrant their vendors, so this is unnecessary."
3,Wasn't blown away,"I bought this DVD on the American amazon website as I am unable to get Miranda Lamberts dvd in Ireland. I love her stuff have all her albums but was a little disappointed.Its just too short, 6 or 7 tracks , your only getting into it and suddenly its over.What she does play is quality, but just too short."
4,This was for my aunt,I brought this DVD for my aunt she is a Miranda Lambert fan so I figured I would get it for her. I'm happy I did.
1,Body glow didn't,I was disappointed with this product. I spread a thick layer on my skin even though the texture like thin clay. I then exposed myself to strong light. When I stepped into a pitch black room the glow was barely visible. There was no way I was going for a even thicker application. Thank goodness it washed off easily. I threw the rest of the paint right in the trash.
4,Useful,My mother has been recently diagnosed with Diabetes and this book has good recipes for her to eat healthy and sugar safely. She is in another country so I haven't been able to taste any of the recipes but she says it's working for her (and the rest of the family).
2,war and remberance,i was suprised when i got petras war and remberance the ad shows the box set and all i got was the tapes the collectores box wasn't there and the book wasn't there. If alls you get is the cassetts then thats what should be shown.i was dissapointed i'm a BIG petra fan and i use to have all there cds and cassettes put they got stolen I hope the person who took then is getting blessed by them.
5,Lamaze toys,"I bought ""Sydney"" for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas and was so impressed that I bought several more. Daniel loved them all, and they've become the toys he reaches for first. They make inexpensive shower gifts, too."
5,A brilliant graphic description of Napoleons Campaigns,I first read a borrowed copy of this book in 1975 (the first printing was done by West Point publishers in the 1960's) and I have been trying to get a copy ever since.It is without doubt the best grahical illustration of Napoleons campaigns ever published and if combined with David Chandlers book on the wars of Napoleon gives a vivid and definatice account of this period of military history.
4,Buy it for the maps....,"The maps are great. As for the text, there is not a simple answer. When researching Borodino and the Russian campaign I found it to be unreliable. On the other hand Elting understood the essence of the men and methods of the period like no one else and his writing was full of insights. By all means use the maps and read his text, but most of all pick up his Swords Around a Throne. THAT is his masterpiece."
5,A Military Histoey and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars,Schnelle und gute Lieferung. Jeder Zeit wieder. Klasse Atlas über dieses Thema. Für mich gibt es nichts vergleibares!
3,"Good, but NOT the Holy Grail","Having owned the original edition, and having used it extensively over the years, I did reinvest in the new edition. However, I was disappointed that the new edition contained almost all of the originals errors, which were mostly vis-a-vis troop movements and strengths---many during the campaigns of the Revolutionary period and early Empire. Therefore, I will continue to use this as a map source in conjunction with more detail and reliable text histories. Oh, and Elting's ""opinions"" of books and their value found in the back, they are just that...Elting's opinions. It is a good book, but far, far from the Holy Grail of Napoleonic history."
4,reading with the rabbit,"Peter Rabbit preschoolhas very playable games that are fun while focusing on word reconition and first letter sounds which later come together with spelling games. My kids love all the reader rabbit games they are fun and educational. The 5th star is reserveddue to the incompatiblity with MacOs. You need to run classics, which you have to download...it's touchy. We need more software for the Mac!"
4,Love Reader Rabbit,"My 3 1/2 yr old son graduated from rr baby & toddler to this a few months ago and it's been great. He needed help at first but caught on really quickly. I just wish they would provide a parents' manual with it because sometimes he gets frustrated because he hasn't got enough crystals to do something and I can't help as I haven't actually played the game through myself. But he now knows how to use the mouse to point, click and drag without really having been shown and without having spent hours playing - he spends maybe an hour a week on the computer."
5,Works with Special Needs Kids,"I was amazed that after only about 2 weeks of playing with this, my 2 year old son was actually able to figure out the games. He has severe language difficulties, sensory issues and behavior problems. Usually he could not sit long enough to play a computer game because there was not enough interaction for him. He loves this game and points to the computer all the time to try to tell me he wants to play. He is actually trying to ""count"" to 5 with the game and ""sing"" (in his own gibber-jabber language)some of the songs. There is no exact mouse clicking to frustrate him. Anything close works! This is an awesome game for toddlers to feel like the big kids and not be frustrated."
3,Smooth 50's Style,"Just received my CD - very classy, very smooth. Julie London was a great songstress. Give this a try if you are looking for some great mood music."
4,Good but not excellent,"While Julie London wasn't in the same class as Sarah Vaughan, Rosemary Clooney or Ella, she was as good as most pop singers. This album is good enough to probably stay in my collection, but I wish the recording levels song to song had been better controlled."
5,SUPERIOR RECORDING,"IF YOU LIKE JULIE LONDON, YOU MUST HAVE THIS ONE IN YOUR COLLECTION. IT IS WONDERFUL."
4,Jammed with the politics and poetry of the sixties,"This cd is everything you want in a specialized anthology. ""Where Have All The Flowers Gone"" is pure art and poetry. It takes you full circle and makes your heart sink. ""Eve Of Destruction"" is full of rage and insight and truth. It's atomic in its message and presentation. ""With God On Our Side"" is one of Dylan's best songs (best version is by Baez). Pure poetry again. And the whole cd goes on like that. Great sound. The somber ""Society's Child"" and the hauntingly barefoot on shards of glass ""Abraham, Martin And John"" slices you in two. ""Ball Of Confusion (That's What The World Is Today)"" is Motown exploding. ""War"" keeps the message movin'. ""Signs"" was always one of my favorite radio songs. This is a must for anyone who lived through the late sixties and early seventies and felt the rage and fear at the destruction and insanity from sea to sea. This collections serves as both great music and powerful inspiration. Buy it!"
4,Forty somethings: Remember when you knew everything?,"I was a teeny bopper when most of these tracks were first played on the radio and I loved them just because they were great tunes. Films like ""Good Morning Vietnam"" and UKTV programs such as ""The Rock And Roll Years"" revealed the true meaning of the lyrics and allowed me to enjoy the music for a second time. This CD has allowed me to enjoy the music for a third time - at high volume because now I own the remote control!The album has a well balanced mix of messages about the absurdity of war, discrimination and mans inhumanity to his/her neighbour. Even if you don't give a toss about all that crap you will still enjoy the CD simply because it's all good music instead of the normal couple of good tracks mixed in with a pile of insignificant dross! Martin Wild, Oman Feb 99"
4,This is a great CD,"I love nearly all these songs, but I had to take one star off because some the greatest were missing: ""Blowin' in the Wind"" by Peter, Paul, and Mary, ""When I was Young"", by the Animals, ""One Tin Soldier/Theme From Billy Jack"" by Coven, ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart"" by Jackie DeShannon, and the all-time best: ""People Get Ready"" by the Impressions - how could they leave that one off? But overall, a great CD."
1,Blah Blah Woof Woof,"I LOVE Creed so don't get me wrong here but... this book is horrible, 1) and foremost it isn't endorsed by Creed 2) the book is not written well, and 3) you can't figure out what is true or false. I didn't like the way that Creed was compared with bands such as Pearl Jam and the Doors. The fact of the matter is if you like Creed, watch VH1's Behind the Music: Creed, it's much easier to understand, and you know that Creed agreed with it."
2,One for the outhouse,"If you have access to internet and a library don't waste your money on this book. For those who don't have such, this rates fine for reading in your backwoods outhouse. Singer Scott Stapp puts great emphasis on seeking for truth and though these writings contain a good amount of ""What If"" situations to generate a sense of living in the moment, SO much is repititious speculation. One point disturbing to me was the fabrication of what Mr. and Mrs. Stapp experienced in the birth of their son Scott. We big fans know that Preacher Stapp is Scott's stepdad. Scott's birth father left when he was a preschooler. (People magazine, March 2001.) Seek and ye shall find, fans. But don't look here."
1,Ehhh.....I dunno...isn't endorsed by Creed...,"I've read a lot of stuff about this book, and there are a LOT of discrepancies. I have also heard that this is not authorized by Creed or anyone haveing to do with them....so I don't know how authentic the facts are, since no one in Creed has verified them."
3,Seems like a good product but color not as described...,"The 9' jump rope was advertised as being red and white in color. The rope I received is blue and white. The seller advised that if I wanted a red jump rope, it would be 7' as they are color-coded by length. Only buy this product if the color doesnt matter!"
2,Do not buy for excersising!,"It may be good for kids.. But still, It depends what to compare it to.I purchased it for exercising as fun fitness option - I liked jumping when I was younger.And it is very slow! Very very slow! You will get bored with this rope rather fast and through it in a farthest corner of your room. It will be another thing that you bought, used once and now just keeping.It does not allow much of tricks.I had to buy another one. Actually the 'Everlast Leather Weighted Jump Rope', also from Amazon. And it is way better!The good thing I can tell about this jumping rope is that you can take off some chains and make it shorter - so it is adjustable for height."
2,not very good..,"i've read over ten outlines in this vien. read, 'compact guide to christian life' by karen lee thorp' it's much better."
4,Bob Wills Is Still The King,"No one can dispute Bob Wills' dominance of the Western Swing genre, even twenty-five years after his death. The thirty-two songs on this album are all classics, and they, along with the fairly extensive liner notes, provide a nice retrospective on Bob Wills' long career. For true fans who have the money, though, the Tiffany Transcriptions set is probably the way to go."
1,How to cash in on Islamophobia,"Ibn Warraq does not really exist. the book was written by a group of people who tried to distill all the stereotypes and hate to conjure up a story. The book is written mostly for a western audience who for years has been bombarded with negative stereotypes about Islam for many years and and are easily convinced with these lies. the book is preaching to the already converted haters of Islam. This jejune attempt at offending Muslims is falling on deaf ears. By the way, what the ibn warraq group say about england today where out of 65 million people only 50,000 mostly elderly go to church and Islam in england is doubling every year with 80% mosque attendance. 3/4 of all revert are white unmarried females. write that one warraq."
5,Islam is Peace,"Those who disbelieve, among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists, will be in HELL FIRE, to dwell therein. They are the WORST OF CREATURES."" (Sura 98:6)""Seize them and SLAY THEM whereever you find them: and in any case take NO FREINDS or helpers from thier ranks."" (Sura 4:101)""FIGHT those who believe not in Allah nor the last day."" (Sura 9:29)""For the Unbelievers are open ENEMIES to you."" (sura 4:101)Why would you want to follow a religion that teaches this evil?"
2,More Atheist Dribble,"Although it is quite accurate portraying Muhammad as the military leader of a desert robber group intent on raping, murdering and pillaging --this book is completely anti Religion altogether. Were this writer to stick to the subject at hand, instead of plying us with accolades on Darwinism and all sorts of atheist propaganda, I may have even recommended this book. Believing that man/women with all their complexities simply evolved is like believing a 747 was miraculously created by itself from a junkyard heap of parts. The writer of ""Why I am not a Muslim"" takes every opportunity to strike at all religions and religious beliefs. He fills many of the pages with quotes from other atheists to give credibility for his own warped spiritual misgivings. If you believe in anything whatsoever, I'd pass up on this biased book."
1,The other side of story....,Please do read the following link to really understand the psyche behind warraq's writing or any other writer writing about Islam. I am sure this would help to balance the views you have -http://www.city-net.com/~alimhaq/text/warraq.htm
1,Miserable,Utter crab which pretends to be scholarly reflection.. Chances are quite high that Mr. Warraq does not even know Arabic. I bet he actually is a good old Western Orientalist :) who comes up with the brilliant! idea of destroying a religion that over a billion men believe in. I strongly recommend you to read something serious about Islam before this hopeless attempt of dis-information.
1,"Uwwww.... Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting","Islam is everything contrary to what this author says in his book. If Islam is so awful, it would not be the 2nd largest religion in the world and the fastest growing religion in the world, despite the fact that it is still such a young religion. Islam has such a powerful message, every corner of the world, from Asia to South America, is turning to it. Islam's message is so sweet and gentle reading the Quran still gives me the chills and brings tears to my eyes. We are all creatures of God and creatures of love, if Islam is so awful, so many of us would not be so drawn to it."
1,Myopic View of Islam,"Great Job Done! the book is misleading, biased and has got no historic footing. Prejudice and hatred can only produce this sort of work. References qouted are wrong...book only supports anti muslim stance, what's the fun in wasting energies and using efforts to disfigure a faith?"
1,"Interesting yet, too biased and decieving.","I would have given this book 4 stars had it been just a tad fair but it isn't. Since when is understanding the religion's true teachings taught from an anti-Islamic perspective?I respect this book, just as much as I respect cousin moe, couisin larry and cousin curly. Thank God I was elegible for a refund."
1,Hear the other side...,"I'd recommend those who've read the book to also read Jeremiah McAullife's trenchant criticism of it atTrends and Flaws in Some Anti-Muslim Writing as Exemplified by Ibn Warraq by Jeremiah D. McAuliffe, Jr., Ph.D.http://www.city-net.com/~alimhaq/text/warraq.htm"
4,Terrifying,"This book is poorly written, unorganized, and blatantly venomous. Yet it still manages to damn Islam with its own words and deeds. The timeliness of the subject and the overwhelming, convincing evidence make it crucial reading despite its stylistic weaknesses.The last two chapters are particularly strong: if you get bogged down in all the details and are ready to put this book down, be sure to give them a look; they are the most readable."
4,Finally someone said it.,"Because of the imperfect translation from Arabic to English in the Quran many people ignorantly convert to Islam everyday choosing bondage over freedom. Many people read the techings in the Quran referring to the Mecca years and conviently disregard the Medina years of Muhammad, which if read correctly negates the Mecca years. Now one may say this author may lack information on how to write a book, this and that or whatever, but the information in this is very valuble just the same. If you are considering buying this book you may be a Muslim with doubt. If you want to read a book that will open your eyes this book is a good start. Another book that maybe worth a look is Islam and Jews writen by Dr. Mark Gabriel; Doctor of Islamic History and Culture and former graduate and professor at Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt. With passages like Surah 4:47, 9:5 and many others in the Quran you can not help but to be in doubt. It is only natural."
3,Very Insightful!,"Ibn Warraq has given much scholarly insight and perception of Islam because he was brought up with the religion and grew up in Pakistan. He is forthright and provides many sources and further publications with his narraration. This is a reading for current Muslims who are suspicious of the absurdness and inconsistency of Islam or anyone who is resentful and at the same time, curious about the religion. The book doesn't only ignite intellectual and rational criticism; it also gives the reader a sort of whimsical upper hand--Warraq was in no way attempting to be facetious--but I found a lot of what these Muslims believe in to be 'funny'--Muslims are stupid, irrational and a major threat to the civilized world and humanity as a whole."
1,very Misleading!!,This book is misleading ofcourse! .. I suggest every non muslim who read this book to read another book which state FACTS about Islam! .. Islam is the fastest growing religion on earth and that is only because people knew the truth about islam!
1,Former Christian now Muslim,"I guess your book is falling on deaf ears..I should say, sane ears. Why are some many people entering Islam? I am a former missionary who entered islam. many many people like me are doing the same thing...go figure"
1,Please dont throw away your money,"Propaganda,lies and deceit by some one who hates islam and muslims and has faintest of idea about islam."
1,COME ON THIS SUX,This man is ignorant he knows nothing about Isalm he just makes his opinions into fact. I really felt bad for the dumb author.
1,He's been a Muslim-basher for years,"""He's been a Muslim-basher for years,"" CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said. ""This is America, and he can do it and we are free to challenge him when he does. I just wish he'd use his real name so we could find out his background and why he hates Islam. If you really believe that all Muslims are evil and dangerous and that Islam is intrinsically evil, what then? But they never answer that question..."""
1,Full of bitterness,"The book is useful in some of its documentation of facts regarding Muhammed, the Koran and the development of Islam. However, the author has an enormous axe to grind - not only against the faith he once held, but against all forms of belief. He constantly refers to the lack of rational and critical thought of Moslems, Christians and Jews, but he himself is not open to any informed opinions on them, quoting those scholars with a like bias. There is such a tone of bitterness, even hatred, against the presence of the Divine that it mars the reading of the book. For those of us who aren't knowledgable about Islam, it leaves us with the question of whether we are reading a fair commentary on it."
2,Full of Gaps and leaps,"Like many since 9/11 I have jumped on the bandwagon to find out why ""they"" hate us. well I was lent theis book, and although it was definitetly well written, and easy to follow, I still found it to have many many gaps. Thereare far better books written by non-Muslims . Authors like Esposito and Armstrong who passionatly study and teach world religions and history for a living. So I can understand how anyone who hasn't read scholarly writings would find this as informative and clarifying, but in fact if you read something a little more advanced you will see the enormolus gaps, and leaps the author makes."
3,Probably good,"I haven't read it yet, but it is probably good reading. It seems theoretical. In order to understand why you shouldn't be a Muslim, just pick up the first two chapters of the Kuran to see its anti-semittism (propaganda against Jews) in full color. Hitler was also against Jews, and we see what happened to Hitler."
5,"An expose of an evil ""religion""","Forget the false assurances of Muslims about their ""religion"": behind all their bland statements about peace and tolerance there always lurks a pitiless and fanatical sword. That's what Salman Rushdie found out, and that's what motivated this learned, compassionate and magnificently courageous expose of a ""religion"" that Ibn Warraq demonstrates is nothing more than a gangster's creed, founded by a failed mentally-ill trader and based on an incoherent, contradictory, sadistic and anti-Jewish farrago called the ""Qur'an,"" that almost certainly was composed after Muhammad's death and which had nothing to do with supposed ""revelations"" from God to him. Take the rantings of the Hezbollahists on this page as ironic and powerful testimony for the substance of this outstanding critique: it is all you will ever need to know about Islam."
3,Why I am not a Christian,"Bertrand Russell's collection of essays and titled ""Why I am not a Christian"" should be part of a trilogy along with Ibn Warraq's ""Why I am not a Muslim"". I am still waiting for ""Why I am not a Jew"". Then the absurdity of religion would be fully exposed."
2,Wait a second and take a breath!,"There should be a clear distinction between the real teachings of a certain religion and the actual behaviour of its followers. Muslims are also human and not one of them can claim that he is without a sin. It is no secret that Muslims can make mistakes in appliying and understanding their religion. The same is true in Christianity as was demonstrated by the Pope when he apologised for the evils commited by the Church throughout the ages. Thus to criticise Islam as being flawed and to base such criticisim on the behaviour of some of its adherents is to commit a grave mistake. In order to form an accurate picture of a certain religion, one should examine its teachings carefully and not base his conclusions on what is publicised in the media. I advise Warraq and some of the reviewers to wait a second, take a breath, and reexamine the issue in an enlightened fashion."
2,Non-atheists beware,"There's a pretty big omission in all the publicity for this book and others by ""Ibn Warraq."" He did not just turn against Islam; he turned against all religion, becoming a rabid atheist and self-described secular humanist. He describes all religions as ""sick men's dreams,"" and most of his co-authors agree with him. His and his sources' comments about Christianity, in one of his books, are so biased and extremist as to seriously undermine his arguments against Islam. There is undoubtedly good information in the book but I for one would never be sure when I could trust his statements. It's like reading a negative wine review then finding out the reviewer is a teetotaller."
2,"Aggressively biased, but needs to be objectively critiqued","This work must be intellectually assailed within the context in which it is presented. Religious emotionalism should not be a factor in a balanced criticism. Each section of the book should be placed in a historical, cultural, and pychological framework. Bertrand Russell wrote a book about why he was not a Christian; understandably so because he was an atheist--still his position is still studied, by those who desperately desire not to become anti-Christian. The same degree of study should apply here; study what he has to say, critique each aspect with somber documentation and let the evidence fall where it may. No book should be condemned(burned) because it affronts our sensibilities. Allah is the best Knower. Allah has a plan, Shaitan(Devil) has a plan, but Allah is the Greatest of Planners"
2,why i am not a muslim,"A rather disappointing book - it promises a great deal in it's introduction but from there onwards it just disappoints.The chapters relating to the founder of Islam and on its major writing, the Koran, the book has very little to say apart from accusing the founder of being a bloodthirst fraud and the so-called ""sacred"" book of Islam as being a collection of contradictions and prefabrications, an accusation which can be made against any one of the major religions.The chapters relating to the religo-political situation and complection of Islam is nothing new and adds very little to the debate. The authors discussion of the palce of women in an Islamic society is again poor - anyone with an elemenatry knowldge of Islam would be aware of the facts.When summed up - I wished i hadn't purcahsed the book and found the reading of it not at all informative or helpful in my attempt to understand Islam."
4,Eye-opening,"This book is eye-opening and very detailed. It can be repetitive at times and seems to lose its way occasionally, but it is in general very engaging.I read the Kindle edition, which, sadly, was full of misprints and not well formatted. Amazon really needs better quality control."
4,Islam challenged,"This book challenges the historical, theological, and theoretical bases of Islam. It is unsparing in its analysis of how the Koran and sharia law came into existence. It portrays an unflattering picture of the prophet Mohammed. Finally, it compares Western philosophy and political theory to that of Islam, and finds Islam to be ossified and lacking in human values.It quotes widely from both Islamic and Western sources and gives the reader an overview of the theological premises discussed in much less detail in Bernard Lewis' books, such as What Went Wrong.A minor criticism is that it is not tightly organized and often overlapping in arguments from one chapter to the next. This is far outweighed by the force of the arguments presented, and the searing criticism of Islam that more timid texts (eg., Karen Armstrong) are unwilling to make."
5,Wake Up West!,"Spelling errors, weird organization, huge reliance on secondary sources. Yes, this book has all these faults, but none-the-less, it's one of the most important books published in the waning years of the 20th Century. If you're a Westerner who cares about holding on to all you've got, please read this book and ponder the challenges that a resurgent, political Islam poses to those of us who cherish freedom, democracy and intellectual growth. Buy this book for yourself and a few spares, if you can afford it, for a friend or friends."
2,Excuse me...,"I have flipped through this book, so I don't have a right to rate it until I have read it all; so u can ignore my ratings. But I would like to say one thing, and that is that every religion at the beginning has had a harsh truth in it. First of all, the Jews were the one who crucified Christ, and the Christians were the ones who brought in the crusaders who caused a huge massacre. EVERY religion had a brutal history so Islam is no indifferent. And honestly, I have never heard not even once in my life about Muslims treating any women in the HISTORY of Islam in any way barbarically. I am a recent convert of Islam because I realized how much Islam praises women and gives her more rights and appreciates the woman as well as her body more than any other religion. So PLEASE, before judging a religion, research every single aspect on it before writing an entire book on a religion, which you are not even part of."
1,This book is horrible,This book was a sheer waste of time. I don't recommend it to anyone who actually is out on a quest to learn something. It is filled with lies and defaming accusations that do nothing but feather the nest of this non-Muslim who clearly has lost his sense of life and self. Definitely not a worth while bet.
1,WHAT BS!,"I have to say this is the worst book i have ever read. I could write a better book. And i should call it: ""Why I Became a Muslin and why i'm no longer a CHIRSTIAN"" Although he does try to prove his points very clearly. He obviously has no understanding of the religion. AND I DON'T CARE IF HE THINKS HE WAS A MUSLIM. Cuz with all the B.S. he has writin he obvioulsy wasn't a practicing muslim.If you want a better understand of what the religion is about go find non-muslim sources that help you understand what the religion really stands for. Find out from people who are ""TRUE"" ""PRACTICING"" muslims and find out how they live there lives. Pick up the book, UNDERSTANDING ISLAM for DUMMIES. I think this book is better then the garbage this author is spewing."
1,A very bad 'review' of the religion,"This book is simply horrible. It even states it talks about the bad parts of islam. The bad parts.It doesn't talk about the good sides.The reviewers are people who really don't know anything about the religion other than what the book said.Well, there was someone else.A FORMER muslim.For what strange reason do you think someone would praise a book against religion he used to be part of. And Jihad does not mean holy war. The arabic word means struggle. This book takes what the quran really says and tangles it into bundled up nonsense. I appreciate the reviewer who said every religion has its bad parts. I suggest reading a non biased version of the quran first then reading the book if you still want to. If you want to learn about something new, why learn its bad parts and think it is bad?"
1,Wait a second and take a breath!,"There should be a clear distinction between the real teachings of a certain religion and the actual behaviour of its followers.

1,a big joke,"What an inspiring example of ""bravery"" (as one reader called it) by ibn warraq, writing against the death threats of endless rows of maniacs and illiterate fundamentalists, showing the ""secrets"" of Islam, which the islamic intellectual tradition, with all its thousands of scholars, spanning 1400 years, with access to all the original texts of islam, could somehow not find. Unfortunately this book makes a joke of intellectual honesty, it being a rehash of all of the lowest, cheapest, and idiotic of so-called ""arguments"" by orientalist polemics, the ones who point out grammatical errors in the Quran and themselves having no more than a 3rd grade knowledge of arabic, and has nothing to do with personal experience. It would make much more sense for the person who would truly wants to learn about Islam to read the Quran..."
1,What a waste of paper!,"You need a whole other book to disprove everything said in this book. But then again, its probably not worth it. He is basing a religion on what a minority of its followers do. It is sad. I would pay NOT to read this crap. It will only take up space on your shelf. I'm Catholic and I know this book isn't impartial whatsoever on Islam.I would recommend ""Unholy War: Terror in the name of Islam"" by Esposito. At least this guy is logicial in his arguements."
1,Blowing Smoke is what........,"this book does. there's not enough time in the day to explain the mistakes in this book. It is a common, but unfortunate, practice of someone to say that they are/were of one religion- and then use that as a base to bash it. it gives them the 'edge' that people like to hear about. this is happening to every religion, and probably always will. i urge readers to find out the history of someone before accepting and processing that person's opinions/ideas. (the wolf in sheep's clothing...) i only gave this book one star because no stars is not an option.. Ibn Warraq has at most minimal knowledge of Islam and is extremely lacking in knowledge of the Arabic language. [....]"
1,Is it Revenge?,"Hi, this book written by a person who never had a faith. If you did believe in a religion you would question rules, events,... And you would find the answer within yourself.But if you can't even understand the religion why try to analyze it?If the reader is an atheist / racist then you would like this book other wise any Muslim, Christian and any person who follows a religion will disagree with every single word written in the so called book.Thank you"
1,not readed .. not rated,"I did not read the book yet, but as a comment:if you want a good idea about the Quran and Who's Mohammed.. why not going for the real thing?!!I'm saying, why not reading verses from the Quran.. some of Mohammed's quotations.. surely there are some that is understandable, don't you agree?"
3,Better as burp cloths or crib support,"These blankets are good rolled up as support for a newborn in the cradle or as burp cloths when they start spitting up, but they aren't big enough, really, as swaddling blankets. Perhaps a really small newborn would swaddle okay in them, but they seemed too small for our 8lb 3oz baby."
5,"Canon i475D a great printer, a great buy","About three months ago I bought an HP photo printer which was fairly well rated. I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of prints from my digital camera and wondered whether my 3 megapixel camera would ever produce great photos at home. Several weeks ago Buy.Com offered these printers for $39; I couldn't resist temptation and bought one. Having now printed more than 100 photos, I'm not thinking I need to go somewhere to get my photos printed. Forget HP and high ink prices. My Canon 475D produces exceptional photos and the ink is cheap; I just bought 2 black and 2 color replacement ink cartridges for around $19; and I'm only about 60% through my original cartridges. I'd buy another one of these in a hearbeat, great value."
5,Most Bang for the Buck,"I got it a couple days ago and have been printing some 4/6s and 8/10s ,going through the easy photo with little adjustment,the pictures from a piddly 2.0 Fuji were just outstanding.Not having the multitank ink cartridges is no big deal,ink is cheap enough.Plenty of good printers out there for the money,but having owned a standard Lex printer,an Epson 88onaither of which I was happy with.It was a toos up with American made H/P and Canon."
3,too relaxed for its own good,"This album has some great tracks, namely ""The Biz,"" ""Leeora,"" and ""The Transaction."" Unfortunately, most of the other songs just don't work; they rely on a lazy jam aesthetic, sacrificing the tight dynamics of The Sea and Cake's best work. This album's highlights are probbaly my favorite Sea and Cake moments, but those highlights are too few, and far between. Check out Nassau instead."
5,One of My Top Five CDs,"First of all, let me say that I absolutely love the Sea and Cake. Second of all, The Biz is their best album (in my opinion). It's loungy and beautiful, and puts me in a good mood."
1,wrong cd,"I ordered ultimate metal cd, and got the wrong one. Ultimate metal 2 was sent to me. I am very disappointed."
2,"Good, but far too expensive","First the good sides: This guy has an impressive way of talking and what he is talking about makes sense.Now the other sides: The DVD is not printed, it is only a DVD-R. The man is only talking, and about stuff you can find in books also.The DVD content is very cheaply produced. It is far overpriced.I recommend www.dieperfektemasche.de. The DVDs are partly in english language and you can order with amazon.de ."
4,fun seventies compilation,"This is a fun compilation of seventies music, as are all the volumes in this series. They could use a few more songs, but who knows, sometimes less is more. This brings me to the insanely high used prices being asked for this. I know it is out of print but It is not worth paying more then list price for this. I bought mine in a record store on 03/12/09 for just under $12.00 including tax."
2,"4 used and new for $65.69, Are you crazy?","I was looking for Big City Miss Ruth Ann, I don't hear this song since 1974. Playground in my Mind is also a hard to find piece, both are simple and light songs. OK, but $65.69 , no, no, no way."
5,My Favorite Game,"After all these years and all these games, this one was the game that I remembered the most. Age 15 now, I played this game all the time when I was a mere 2 years old.I just thought I should share. I just rediscovered the game again after remembering bits and pieces like the name ""Babs"" and some kind of forest.Although that was 1997 and I'm sure games for children have evolved very much, this game holds many fond memories for me."
4,The kids enjoyed it.,"The kids like it and it helps them to learn. They used it for a couple of weeks, then got bored of it. It got them interested in letters and numbers though. It's a good change of pace from hand written learning activities."
1,It's too frustrating for a youngster!!!!,I bought the French Reader Rabbit for reading for my daughter and they were great. I figured that I would try the English version of the kidergarten program for my 3.5 year old son. All the games have a lot of repetitions in them. My son found the pace very slow and soon got very tired of the fact that one has to do all the exercises to get the instruemnt pieces. He played it once and did not want to do it again. Don't bother if your child is about average intelligence. I have some old Curious George and Dr. Suess CD's that does not work with XP. My son had a go with them before I got the new operating system and I will certainly try to get updated versions of those for him instead.
2,where's the angst of previous albums?,"Being a fan of siren song of the counter culture(which was an amazing cd.) I am hard pressed to give them a good rating. But since I put in this cd, I haven't heard the angst or passion from their previous albums. It sounds like the took out all the angst and tried to sound as hard as they could, but it didn't work. This cd was surprisingly lame and there were no standouts."
3,The Sufferer & The Witness,"If you're looking for an album as slick and catchy as ""siren song"", you may want to keep looking, because this record is not for the fairweather fan. It's true, for The Sufferer and The Witness finds Rise Against back tracking to their Fat Wreck Chords days. Clicks and pops in almost every song remind the listener the good recording is so overrated, and at times, the vocals become a drowning noise in clangy, metallic guitar sounds. When a CD-DA sounds like a low bit rate Mp3, you know you've got a true indie sound, and that is exactly what The Sufferer and The Witness is; an indie punk/hxc record. Fans of RPM and The Unraveling should enjoy this one, others may want to preview the record from start to finish before making a purchase. The music gets a 4, lyrics get a 3 and the production and recording get a 0. I think a 3 overall is more than fair."
2,No thanks.,"I purchased this cd on a whim. It was on sale at a local retailer for 6.99. I had moderately enjoyed ""Siren Song"" and (being nearly a quarter Jewish) simply could not pass up such an attractive price. I returned to my auto-car and pealed off the rapper. A leap of faith, an open cd is rather difficult to recieve a cash refund on...or is it?Three tracks into listening it became painfuly obvious that I had made a grevious error. While the song titles and lyrics promised punk ideals the music was quite over produced and left the impression of Post-Hardcore in tattered Punk clothing. A good effort. But, durring the few moments I feel the desire to partake of Hardcore Punk I would much rather do so in some dilapidated dive-bar, where 6.99 would get me 3 bands and 1 domestic bottle."
1,What is this!!! i want less than one star.!!!,"What is this!!! I hate Rise Against and everything they stand for, and for all you people who like this listen to some real music and I do think its amazing they are still around but it goes to show you how dumb of a time we are living in where people dont understand what the hell is going on or anything so if you like this album great, and for the ones who hate it, that means a lot and you might have a better music taste.I wanted to add PUNK MUSIC IS DEAD AND IT IS NEVER COMING BACK AND FOR ALL YOU 12 YEAR OLDS OR WHAT NOT IT IS NOT COMING BACK EVER SO YOU CAN KISS MY BACK END."
5,"Get this album even if you aren't a fan of ""punk""","With catchy choruses, mad drumming, vocals that range from smooth persuasion to screaming passion in a matter of moments, and lyrics imbued with meaning, ""The Sufferer and the Witness"" has a lot to offer any music lover.This is my first Rise Against album, and their previous relases have been bumped to the top of my ""CDs to Buy"" list. I can't stop listening to it. It's one of those CDs that feels like it transcends genre."
3,"Heavy, but ultimately just OK","After hearing a couple of songs on the radio, I went out and bought this. Unfortunately, the vocal style is a little too monotonous and becomes tiring to listen to after a while. Granted the music itself is quite interesting and rocks pretty hard. Still, as a whole the album sounds a little too similar from track to track and is not interesting enough to warrant repeat listens without wanting to hear something else. There are some catchy hooks on a few songs, but unfortunately, they are either the songs you hear on the radio or sound like the songs that are played on the radio. I really wanted to like it, but it wasn't quite my cup of tea."
5,My favorite Album yet!!!!,"Rise Against is my favorite band. After hearing Siren song of the Counter Culture (their third album) i was dissapointed. I was hoping that they would come up better with the sufferer and the witness and they did. Songs like Bricks, and Chamber cartridge are really great. So if you like punk music, by this record!!!!!"
4,More goodness from Rise Against!,"I have all of Rise Against's CDs. I've been a fan since I bought my first one, and I've been to see them live. My favorite album has always been Revolutions Per Minute, and the songs on The Sufferer and the Witness sound like they could have been written at the same time.The hardcore punk rock is still a very powerful part of their sound, but the strong melodies of the vocals always come through to give the songs something more than you would normally expect from the genre. I especially like tracks 1,2,6, and 7.I miss the screaming guitar solos of their past albums, but the musicianship on The Sufferer still impresses me each time I listen to it.If you liked their other CDs, this one will not let you down!"
5,Great Band,This is a great album by a GREAT band. Buy ALL their albums now. Mix of Hard rock and Punk that is infectious while delivering a strong message.
4,3 1/2 stars,"Not nearly as good as Siren but still worth the buy. Siren was an amazing album this one rocks good just nothing mind blowing, but like I said still worth the purchase, plenty of good tracks."
3,Programming the Parallel Port,"I wanted to know if and how I could use the parallel port to input data from my old Heathkit weather station. It is a free running system that displays in and out door temperatures, barometric pressure and wind speed and direction. It stores the maximum and minimum values of the above too. If I could get the data into my PC, I could archive and analyze it. This book helped me understand the port data lines and how they are used to talk to the peripheral connected to it. It is an old book, Copyright 1998, so the sample programs are in C language and I have not learned to use 'C' yet. I still have to build the interface box but it does look promising. I have Windows XP Home ED. and a 'Home-brew' PC. running at 2 G Hz."
5,What your PC must do to sieze the world by the bits.,"This very up-to-date handbook reveals little-known secrets of PC hardware and the software needed to control the outside world with a PC. Suitable background in electronics is given for the book to be used as a textbook, yet the approach is that of a helpful cookbook. Going beyond the PC, the important topic of microcontrollers is addressed. Best of all, important problems in data measurement using PCs can be addressed with very inexpensive hardware easily built (a complete novice might need a Radio Shack style guide to how to do soldering). Software is included in source code form on disk, an added bonus. Reading this book won't get you an EE degree but it might be the next best thing."
2,"""Electronics Today"" treatment of the subject","Relatively complete treatment of the basic Centronics and Bi-directional modes. About 5 pages devoted to EPP and ECP--nothing about protocols or support from any (modern) operating system. All examples use Bios calls which are unavailable after DOS. Looks like a re-tread of a much earlier work. Hardware-software examples are fine, but utilize many parts which have been out-of date for years. A real disapointment..I sent it back!"
1,Can I give it negative stars?,"Thanks a lot, Hartz - this product is awful! I took it out of the box, unwrapped it (it was shrink wrapped in plastic), and the legs promptly broke off one side. The bowls are quite small - even though I knew the dimensions of the bowls before ordering, I was surprised how tiny they looked in person. They'd still work, but large cats may not be able to get at the bits left in the bottom of the bowl. In any case, it's irrelevant, since I threw away the metal frame and am using the bowls as craft bowls or around-the-house-work-bowls. The entire product is horribly made. I've had my current steel bowl dishes in a metal frame for 9 years and they're still going strong - it's unfortunate that I can't find another set for the downstairs area. My cats will continue to eat from ceramic dishes!"
5,Great Toy!,"My 3 month old was only moderately interested in the multitude of infant toys that I bought for her. As soon as she saw Patty the Panda however, she got very excited! She interacted with the toy for quite a while! Any time that she is especially fussy, I show her Patty the Panda and her mood quickly changes! I'm buying this for each of my pregnant friends."
2,"a rip-off, don't buy it!","I bought it from toys'us. it arrived today. It's very filmy. a worth of $5 only.Never a great toy. never an educational toy! the eyes are not shinny as those in the photos. anyhow, I feel cheated! not what I thought!Don't buy it before you hold it and have a closed look."
5,a special book,The Pythagorean Proposition collected 367 proves is very special book.this book collected math.&history of human cultures.
1,This is not Steve Perry From Journey,This is not Steve Perry From Journey and the singer doesnt even sound like him amazon should make a effort to label this I seen more reviews like this one.
3,Good quality....BEWARE of sizes,"Pants are of very good quality material. Sizes are much smaller then usual. I wear between a med and large, so I bought the larger size. Looked like size SMALL and felt like it too. Can't wear them and unable to return because they require tags attached and I took them off before trying clothes on."
4,Sing a Mournful Song,"Townes Van Zandt was the greatest. He deserves tribute albums. These artists are the right people to record this album.But the album is SO DARN SAD. Every track is recorded like a funeral hymn.Now to be fair, some of these songs can't really be recorded any other way. Upbeat versions of ""Marie"" or ""Waitin' Round to Die"" would be perverse.But ""If I Needed You"" doesn't need to be a lamentation. And Robert Earl Keen (whom I love dearly) bafflingly turns the rapid-fire, raucous celebration of poker, ""Mr. Mudd & Mr. Gold,"" into a slow, weary wail. The most perky-sounding track on this album is, wierdly, Delbert McClinton's ""Pancho & Lefty.""Don't get me wrong; this is a beautiful album. Maybe sheer grief at the Master's passing has made it such a sad album. I know Townes, like Leonard Cohen, has a reputation for writing sad stuff. This tribute album seems to accept that reputation. It's a good album. I only wish it could also have celebrated Van Zandt's joyous side."
2,Mud and Gold,"I looked forward eagerly to this tribute album but was ultimately disappointed. None of the cuts come close to the great man's own interpretations. Only Steve Earle and Delbert McClinton give acceptable renditions of 'Two Girls' and 'Pancho & Lefty' respectively. My advice would be to get the real thing in 'Live at the Old Quarter, Texas' or any of Townes' own (especially live) albums. This album was Mud to Townes' Gold, only this time Mr Mud didn't come out on top!"
2,You Are Not Needed Now,"There are some great names singing great versions of great songs here, but when all is said and done I heartily recommend you get your fingers dirty with the real thing. Let LIVE AT THE OLD QUARTER or REARVIEW MIRROR be your introduction. This guy's like a cross between Hank Williams & early Leonard Cohen. Needless to say, he was not afraid of the dark.Like the cheesy cover of POET, this star studded tribute (whose heart is in the right place) is just a white-washing of the crooked, meandering fence Townes set up between Nashville and what has come to be known as ""Alternative Country"". In short, the originals kick the guts out of any the cover here.It certainly isn't a bad record, but who needs a new car when the old jalopy runs just fine."
2,ordinary,"a pretty ordinary compliment of music, did not do Townes any justice.I would not recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the real music of townes Van Zandt"
5,"Poet, and then some","Diverse tribute to Van Zandt and his rich body of work performed by notable artists ranging from Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris and Guy Clark to Nanci Griffith, John Prine and others. Favorites such as ""If I Needed You"", ""White Freightliner"" and ""Pancho & Lefty"" are accompanied by lesser-known gems as further evidence of Van Zandt's impressive songwriting talent and deep humanity. A great listen."
4,A great tribute CD,"This is not your regular tribute cd. Not like some executive said let's cash on Van Morrison, and let's invite Bowie and Springsteen and do a tribute album. All the artists in this cd have been part of Townes Van Zandt's life when he was alive, all of them have covered his songs, long before most people hears his voice. The covers here are rich and all of them seem like new songs. Van Zandt's songs seem to get the best of most of these artists, and his songs seem to handle well different versions, and give a new angle of the son. Most songs are acoustic, but there are some more electric stuff here, like Billy Joe Shaver, Steve Earle. Willie Nelson is great in ""Stellar"", Guy Clark in ""to Live's to Fly"", Nanci Griffith,Lucinda Williams, etc... Many of this covers could and should be country hits.I rank this tribute cd very high, right there with ""The world is a wonderful place"" tribute to Richard Thompson..."
3,A grab bag,"I have only been listening to Townes for about 7 months and although I arrived late, I have come to see that he is one of the best songwriters of our time. It is hard to hear others sing Townes' music after you have heard his version first, eg ""Around Townes"" but this album has some songs that do not fit into my theory. Highway Kind is one of my favorite songs by Townes and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed the Cowboy Junkies version, as it was not similar sounding at all. Loretta is not bad, Blue Wind is really good but that could be because I have not heard Townes version to spoil me. The same for My Proud Mountains. I was very disappointed in Willie Nelson's cover of Marie and I love Willie. Overall, it is a good tribute and it belongs in every folk lover's music library"
4,LOVED IT!,"I was a big fan of the original series when it aired back in the early 70's, and always wanted the cars behind the series. I purchased the Mach 5 some time ago, but the Shooting Star wasn't available thru that particular website at the time. Now that I have both in my possesion, they complete my collection. The details are very close, but since they are in a display case, I haven't really played with them. This obviously was mean't for collectors, and there must be some care given if meant to be touched every now & again to prevent damage."
5,The Best CD,"This is a good CD, you guys should go get it, my favorite songs are ""Goin' Crazy"", ""Energy feat.Baby Bash"", ""I Can't Wait"". This CD is one of the best"
5,she is the new Natalie Imbruglia!,this girl is much better then Natalie Imbruglia its so nice to hear some good old pop music again not something like is out there today i love this natalie much better then Natalie Imbruglia
3,I LIKE IT,"I ONLY GOT THIS ALBUM BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS GREAT, AND I LIKE IT. I LIKE THIS ALBUM FOR MY LONG DRIVES IN THE CAR.HER VOICE IS NOT LIKE A SANGER BUT IT'S COOL. IF YOU LIKE CIARA AND J.LO, YOU'LL LIKE IT."
5,Good album!,"Through emails and updates, I have been following Natalie's story for months because she is my niece's cousin. Everyone was so excited when she signed on a record label and I was introduced to her music by my sister, whose husband is also Natalie's cousin. She has a very soothing, soft voice on 'goin' crazy' so it's a nice love song, and 'energy' really grew on me, it's kinda cool that someone we know has ringtones on TMobile! haha. I think everyone could not be more proud of her. Great album, I think it will do very well..."
3,Boring,"It's not like this album was terrible, it's just boring. All the songs sound exactly the same except for Goin' Crazy. This CD is just weak and the lyrics are boring. I would not recommend going out and buying this album. If you still want it download it; but don't waste no more then $7 dollars on it."
5,Natalie,natalie has a very good voice. Her music is very good. my favorite song is energy. You should get this cd.
3,"good, but not as i expected","Natalie is a good singer, with a nice, rich voice that produced the hit ""Goin' Crazy"" Goin crazy was the first hit for natalie, followed by ""Energy"". I thought the cd was average on the amout of song talent (thats a weird way to describe it). however, it was good with many soulful, slow songs that i enjoyed very much. But there was a problem there too.there were one too many soulful, slow songs. excluding ""I can't wait"", one of the best songs on the album, pretty much all of the songs were really slow and rather boroing after listening to them for a few weeks. i hope natalie will use more variety on her next album.i would give this alblum 3.4 stars or so because it had good songs, but not enough variety. i would reccomend this if you wanted to get a complete, nice prom/soul album. but if you want a good all-around album, turn somwhere else."
4,Natalie first album,"1. Goin' Crazy :9,5.Her first hit.A nice and sweet ballad.2. Energy:9.Her second single is an uptempo track,really sweet and catchy3. Better Get It Right:10.This is another upbeat track,with great verses,beats and chorus.I love it,her best track.4. Ooh:8.A nice ballad,really relaxing :)5. You Don't Love Me No More:6.Is an ok song.6. I Can't Wait:6,25.This can get a bit annoying sometimes,but It's ok.It's a club track.7. Stay:6,5.I expected a lot more in this track,which is Natalie's favourite.8. Something About You:7,75.A semi-uptempo track.Is catchy and fun.9. You're the One:10.Her second best song.I love it a lot.Is like an upbeat ballad.10. Emptiness:7.Is Ok...11. Where Are You:9.I love how the voices sound together.This is her third single I think.12. Me Faltas Tu:9,5.Even better than the english version."
3,Interesting concept; shaky execution,"I really enjoyed the concept behind this book. A teenager living in 1996 who thinks it's 1840? Intriguing. Haddix had a great idea, and creates a lot of suspense by providing elements of surprise, wonder, and danger. There were a few weak points, though. The plot provides some twists towards the end that require some serious suspension of disbelief, and the ending is a little bit pat for my taste. But this book stands apart from a lot of the other young readers titles out there, and I think it offers a fairly interesting comparison/contrast between life today and life in the 1840s. If you liked this book, you'll want to check out Lois Lowery's The Giver."
4,Excellent,It was very suspenseful and it makes you want to know more about the comparisons betweent the ninteenth century and the twentieth. Very well put together and very compelling. It's a great book.
3,Running Out of History,"Jessie finds out it's not the 1800's. It's 1996 and the children are dying from diphtheria because of some experiment to have modern families immune to disease. The people of Clifton need help, and Jessie must venture into 1996 to get the cure.She has to find out how to use the phone and other electronics to save the children of Clifton. She must save them before time runs out.I liked the book very much. I think it would be a good book for children in grades 4-6. It is a book you can't put down and very well written. Good job Margaret Peterson Haddix!"
3,AMAZING-ATROCIOUS IN ONE CHAPTER,"What if lives depended on you? Jessie Keyser knows how that feels. In the year 1840 Jessie's home of Clifton is threatened by diphtheria. When Jessie is sent on a dangerous mission, all her thoughts of what is safe change. Running Out of Time is a great book with a dull ending. Margaret Peterson Haddix keeps the plot fresh with new conflicts throughout the book. At the end though, the last conflict is resolved, but the story drones on for another two chapters. I recommend this book to 4th, and 5th graders who don't like any conflicts left unsolved. If you like books with an open ending, I don't recommend Running Out of Time to you."
4,Will Haddix write a Sequel?,"This exciting book is about a girl named Jessie who thought she was living in the 1840's, but she really lived in a historical preserve. Outside it was 1996. Jessie was sent to the real world by her, mom to get medicine for the sick children with diphtheria. Everything was new to her like the cars and light bulbs and she had lots of questions.I like the way the author wrote in third person and the details. It also had a very interesting plot and I could not put the book down. I was disappointed about the ending because it really confused me."
3,Will Running Out of Time Waste your Time?,"Jessie is a young girl who lives in Clifton, a small town during the mid 1800's. When the children in Clifton get sick and start dying, Jessie's mother sends her on a perilous journey out into the world. The world outside Clifton is definitely not what she thought it would be. Jessie is living in a tourist site in 1996, and she has to learn to adapt to the outside world.Running Out of Time is a good book. It's especially good if you enjoy cliff hangers. I would recommend this book to children ages nine to twelve. Girls will probably find this book more interesting than boys because the main character is a girl. I hope you appreciate this book as much as I did"
3,Is Running Out of Time Wasting Your Time?,"Jessie is a girl who thinks she is living in the 1800's, but she really is in the year 1996. Jessie lives in the little village of Clifton, and in Clifton there are children who have diphtheria. She needs to go out to the real world to find a man named Mr. Neeley who has the cure for the sick children. When Jessie takes a walk in the real world, she finds things are a lot different than she thought. It's Jessie's job to save the children in Clifton. Will Jessie find Mr. Neeley in time and save the sick children or will she run out of time?I thought Running Out of Time was a good book but not the best book I have read. I would recommend this book more to girls than boys. It would be a good book for grades 4-6. When you read this book, I'm sure you'll like it!"
4,Simply a classic,"This book is Margaret Haddix at her best. Don't let me trick you into thinking that this is her best book: that is Turnabout. But this a superb work of absolute genius.The plot is fresh and original. It takes shocking turns and tricks you every step of the way. It is a delightful read- fast-paced, exciting, and nerve-racking. I simply couldn't put it down.The thing that I don't like is that the book cover gives away the main detail of the plot too soon. I don't want to tell you the plot because it'll ruin the book's true experience. DON'T READ BOOK COVERS! THEY BLURT OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR HAS TRIED TO HIDE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK!"
5,An exciting adventure Story,"I loved this book. It was exciting, fictional, and a great book for everybody!"
5,Great Book! Very interesting.,"I was 15 when I read this book, so I am over the recommended age. However, I know the Haddix family and thought that it would be interesting to read. Well, I can say that if this book had been around when I was a little younger I would have definately recommended it. It was very descriptive, vivid, interesting, and makes you wonder. I hope that you decide to read it, along with Mrs. Haddix's other books, especially Leaving Fishers (but that one is for slightly older children, so some may want to wait.)"
5,I LOVED this book. It was one the best books I've ever read.,I thought that it was an excelent book. My favorite character was Jessie. I really liked the adventerous events she went on. I hope that there is a sequal to thos book!!!
4,it was ok,It was an epic adventure of this this girl. She had to find a cure for diptheria and she did it. Her town is like the amish. but she lives in 1840 and the world around her is 1996.
4,I liked it even if Nancy Katz didn't!,"If Ms. Katz had read Running Out of Time first, instead of after seeing the movie The Village, maybe she would have liked it better. I think part of the problem may lie in that this book should perhaps be listed for upper elementary instead of Young Adult. I loved it! I enjoy many children's novels, and while this one isn't quite the caliber of a high school English class, it has merit for younger readers/listeners. I read Running Out of Time a while ago myself, and just started reading it to my 5th grade class today. It's a fascinating and suspenseful read."
4,Good read; frightening and exhilirating.,I purchased this book for my nine year old daughter and found it very exciting and scary; I actually had to put it down the first night (it spooked me that much). Jessie's experience of 1996 is well written and kept me on the edge of my seat. I think I'll wait until my daughter is eleven or twelve before introducing her to this book.
4,It is a must read!,"I am a Kindergarten teacher in the state of Michigan. I was required to read this book and also many more for a graduate course that I am taking. So far this book has made the biggest impact on my memory. Jesse a 13 year old girl who lives in a small Indiana town in 1860, or so she believes. Suddenly, a diphtheria epdemic explodes throughout her city. She is called upon to get help form the outside world of 1996. She is able to sneak out of Clifton and hop on a bread truck. She needs to find a man named Mr. Isaac Neely only to discover that he is planning on killing her because she knows to much. The ending will shock you*****it is a must read....:) Dive in."
1,Time Transition?,"I couldn't tell the difference between the 1800s and 1900s unless the author spelled it out for us. The languages between the two centuries were the same, the same way of speech, manners, posture, movement, ideas, et cetera. If you're going to write about time transition, do it right.I thought the cover art was nice though."
1,Don't waste you TIME,"This is the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. My teacher assigned it to us to read and I could never get into it. I mean, how unrealistic! Like a girl would be living in the pioneer days and a disease comes and, oh my gosh! I have to go to the year 2000 to get medicine! How stupid! Especcialy because even pioneer people would know a little bit about the outside world. If your thinking about trying running out of time, don't WASTE your time."
1,Running Out of Words,"I thought this book showed no thought at all, i mean seriously there were no details and a kintergarden person could have wrote it. I,ve read better is all i have to say"
4,Time Ran Away,"For a short read, Running Out of Time is top notch. The begining was not as exciting as I thought it could be. Toward the middle of the book, Jessie, the main character, is escaping her reconstructed village to search for help. As her journey continues she runs into dead ends and events of great stress. After a long time on the streets she finally meets help. But can she be sure that the help she gets will help her out or kill her? MR.?"
3,time travel,"Running out of Time is a fast pace book about a girl living in the 19th century, at least that's what she thinks, but when the town of Clifton gets sick she is forced to go to the real world to get medicine for the childen Clifton, but on her way she meets weird people and learns weird things. The good guys are the bad guys, the safe place is dangerous and the good things are bad. The book is a mix of mystery, adventure and drama. It is scary because of all the new things in Jessie's life. It's mysterious because everybody is not who they are. It is a good book, because the author lets you figure some of the story yourself.I would recommend this book to mystery lovers between 9-12 years old, also people who also like to be at a cliff hanger"
5,The Best Book Ever For Kids,This book is my favorite in the whole world. I could not put it down. When I was reading it to my mother She just loved it. Then I had to go to bed so I could not read anymore but that did not stop her. She read that whole book in one night. That shows how much she liked it. She even took the next day off from work cause she got to bed to late and she was tierd. After that I bought the book so I would always have. When ever I'm bored I always read this book. You should realy read this book if you haven't already.
5,All pages are full of excitement!,"I totally love this book! I love how the author explains so good of how Jesse's feeling when she's out in 1996. The end was pretty supprising. I totally reccomend this book, why?, here are the reasons:1.) There is never a page that is boring.2.) In the 2nd chapter, the whole adventure starts, not wasting the reader's time.3.) She is a 13 year old girl! That is so cool! 13 years old would have to be the best age for the girl to be.4.) Good ending5.)THE BOOK IS JUST TOTALLY AWESOME!GET IT NOW~~I REALLY RECCOMEND IT!- JACLYN (ROSWELL1988)"
3,A book you won&#65533;t want to put down&#65533;,"What is everything you knew suddenly turned out to be false? That?s what Jessie, the main character of this fast-paced novel has to deal with when her mother reveals that the year is 1996, instead of 1840. Jessie and her family live inside a tourist attraction, where everything is kept ?authentic? and only the adults know the truth. However, a diphtheria epidemic has hit the town, and the owners of the tourist attraction are refusing to give the children modern medical care. Jessie?s mother says Jessie is their only hope that one of them can escape to the outside and get the children the medicine they need. Jessie?s escape and reaction to the ?outside world? make for captivating reading, as she rushes against the clock in her mission to save of the children of Clifton who have fallen ill, including her younger sister."
3,Your average kiddie book,"It was ok from my point of view. It started out boring, but got a little more interesting near the end."
2,Could have been really good,"I was really intrigued when a friend told me the plot for this book and I was excited to read it. However, it was very early in the book that I realized that I would not be happy with either the plot, the character development, or writing.The writing is probably the most frustrating. There are so many random statements made throughout the book that aren't clarified. Or, the main character will jump from thought to thought, again without explanation or well written transitions.The Plot and character development are much like the random statements made throughout the book, poorly done."
4,"Good Book but not the inspiration for ""The Village""","After reading about how Shyamalan supposedly stole the idea for ""The Village"" from this book, I decided to buy a copy and read it for myself. Being that it's a juvenile fiction book, it only took me an hour and a half to read. I did like it however. It's a decent book but it only mirrors ""The Village"" in a few plot elements and even those are drastically different. For instance the main plot twist in ""The Village"" was revealed at the end of that film, while in the book it is revealed early on. Still I enjoyed the book, the author does a great job of making it really seem like 1840 before revealing it is really 1996, even when read over again. If you liked ""The Village"" as much as I did then you would probably like this book."
5,Run to get it!,"Jessie is an appealing character with virtually no knowledge of the world in 1996. She's charismatic, as well as clever, when trying to save her village. Haddix has taken a completely original concept and deftly woven science and human nature into an incredible tale for any ages."
5,I could not put this book down! It was great!,"This book was so interesting! I loved it! I could not imagine not knowing what a car, or a phone is. I could not put this book down! It was great!"
3,Running Out of Time- A So-So Story,"I have just started to read the book Running Out of Time. I like this story, because it gives a pretty good description of the 1800's. When Jessie finds out that it is really 1996 instead of 1841, I feel that the story becomes boring. I was not even half way through the story, and it was becoming very boring. Also, I would give this story only three stars because I thought that the plot was way too predictable.When Jessie's mother told her to meet her at night in the woods, Jessie already knows that it has something to do with the disease dipthera that is spreading around. Jessie's mom tells her how it is really 1996, and the author writes for about two chapters with Jessie's mom answering her questions about the real world. There were also many other things in the description that told you Jessie was going to have to go out into the real world to help her town. This story, in my opinion, does not deserve five stars or even four stars."
5,Best Book,"This book is the most exciting and thrilling book EVER. I would suggest to read this book no matter how old you, you would enjoy this book."
4,Read it more than once!,"I know I really like a book if I can read it more than once. This book falls into that category. I think the plot was fantastic, if maybe a tad unbelievable. There was plenty of action and suspence, and I loved seeing the modern world through Jessie's old-school eyes. I like reading alternate reality fiction a lot, and this kind of had the same feel because the world was new to Jessie. Overall, a nice, quick read."
3,RuNnInG oUt Of TiME,I thought running out of time was a great book. the way that it was adventurous and suspensful and even a little scary!!!! I thought the ending was ok and it was just a kinda neat story!!!! The way that she doesn't even know that shes living in a different time than it really is and they are watching her with cameras and they knew she had escaped the whole time!!!!I just thought over all it was a pretty good book!!!
4,Running Out of Time (Book Review),This book is a cool book. This was a cool book because Jessie has to try to get medicine so the people in Clifton won't die from diphtheria. In the book you see what she has to go through.In the book you also see how the 1800's are different from 1996. In the 1800's people did not know what phones ar cars were. Of course you probalbly know they also dressed different too.
4,A very interesting Book,Jessie is a girl in a small town. Her family and her help sick people in town. Now Jessie goes on a mission to get help for her small town. Will Jessie get help for her town? Will she get help in time? Want to find out? Check it out for yourself!
4,Original work with unsatisfactory ending,"A fresh and exciting outlook, both on history and on our present environment, but I found the ending not very informative and fizzling."
2,Don't Waste Your Time by Reading Running Out of Time,"Running Out of Time is a fictional story about a young girl, 13 years old, and her name is Jessie. She lives in a small town in Indiana called Clifton, where it's 1840, and in the outside world it is 1996. In her little town there is a dangerous disease called diphtheria, and the doctor is not allowed to use modern medicine. Jessie has to escape Clifton and go forty miles to the state capitol, Indianapolis. She has to find a doctor by the name of Mr. Neeley and get medicine before time runs out for her friends and family.I didn't really like Running Out of Time because it was too predictable, and I didn't like the ending at all. It needs a sequel, but with this book there isn't a sequel yet. Margaret Peterson Haddix writes in third person, that means the narrator tells the story. I would recommend this book to a child 10 or 11 years old because it's not too long. It's only 184 pages."
3,:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( : ( (Running Out Time),"I am reading Running Out of Time.I would give the book 3 stars because it was boring until the end. If you like to read anything, then you would like it.I don't mean to be mean, but personally I thought that the book was boring.(ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ).At the beginning, it's about a girl's(Jessie)life in 1840. Then she finds out that it's really 1990.So she has to go into the real world and get some medicine for the other children who think its 1840.If I were you I wouldn't spend all of my money on a hard covered book.I would by a paper back book.I thought the book was boring but I thought that the characters were believable."
5,How to save Time!,This book was very interesting it has alot of excitement in it. This book was about a 12 year old girl who is trapped in the 1840's. Lots of people are getting sick were she lives. Jessie lives in a place were lots of people are being heled there for a tourist to see them. Jessie's mother is a midwife and she needs medicine to keep people alive so she sends Jessie out on a long jounery to and find help there is a secerect way out. Her mother shows her. Jessie runs into lots of trouble . To find out if she ever comes back or if she ever got there read this book. If you like mystery you'll love this book.
5,Run to get this book,Running out of Time is one of the bests books I've read so far. It is the about a 13 year-old girl named Jessie who lives in the Clifton Village which makes all the kids believe it is the 1840 when it is really the 1940's. Her mom tells her it is 1940 and she needs to escape to find a cure for all the kids are at the edge of death. She goes through a lot twist and turns like all of the other books Margret Peterson Haddix writes.
4,okay,"This book was fairly enjoyable overall.However, this book did not strike me as original. It probably came out first, but there are so many books and movies that have the same plot that it gets a bit old. Basically, there's this entire civilization living and believing that it's the 1800's (or was it 1900s?). The same thing happens in The Villiage, and The City of Ember. It's sad.This book was good overall, but lacks true character development and plot. An enjoyable read, but typical. It gets rather boring and dull at times as well."
1,"great concept, disappointing delivery","This book has a fascinating concept- growing up in a 'heritage' village believing that it is really 1840. But the concept is never really developed- we only see a juxtaposition of the two worlds in one brief scene, and the adjustments required of the heroine are rather perfunctory. The story quickly becomes a pretty scary chase story where there are no safe places and all the adults- even the few well meaning ones- ending up being frightening or intimidating to the children; the bad guys are very wicked indeed, with explicit Nazi 'better race' overtones. The rationale for their wickedness is lame at best. Even the end is dispatched too quickly, with no tying together of past and present or what this all means to the parents, the children, or the family as a group. Very disappointing."
3,Time...,"I rated this book 3 star becuase ididnt really understand the concept of this book, i dont really know why this book is called Running Out of ""Time ""? But other than that i liked this book quit well theres lots of excitmentint in this book amnd you never know whats going to happen next."
4,"Ahh, the endless debate - which came first, the movie or the book?","I had only the vaguest memories of reading this book in grade school when I went to see M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village."" While the two are intrinsically different - the film focuses on the village and its inhabitants, while ""Running Out Of Time"" focuses on Jessie's experiences outside the village in the modern world - their similarities were more than striking enough to dredge up my old memories of the book; I watched the film with the STRANGEST sense of deja-vu I have ever experienced. I came straight to Amazon after getting home from the theater and didn't sleep until I'd tracked down the book and ordered a copy so I could re-read it.It's definitely a delight, but also definitely aimed at a younger audience. Children and younger teens will love it - just get them to read the book before they see ""The Village""!"
1,Awful!,"I was looking for a good jump rope for fitness, similar to the one my trainer uses. This one is horrible- it's made of weird segmented little hard plastic tubes covering a braided rope. So clunky and slow. A big disappointment."
3,Not a bad jump rope.,"Your average ""school"" jump rope. A bit lighter than I would have hoped for, but otherwise...it is what it is."
5,good quality,This is a good quality jump rope. Now I just need to make myself get out and use it more!
3,This is not the best clay.,"This clay is bad for making models because it is so damn breakable. I used it for making a mold for a rubber toy. Im going to explain the whole prosses but, in the end I threw it away and gots some more clay. THis is not worth a buy unless you have money to waste."
5,Amazing!,My family loves watching this. I can't wait for more Cars Toons! We can watch it over and over again!
3,Movies themselves = great! Price = Meh,"The price on this should be much lower.....you are getting only 36 minutes of view time.The shows are cute - Mater tells an outrageous story and right at the peak of the moment he introduces Lightning McQueen into it and concludes with Mater as the 'hero' and McQueen grateful to be alive! And as usual with Pixar, they have some humor for the adults (I personally love Tokyo Mater - the police car winds up in a donut shop and remarks ""I LOVE donuts"" proceeding to drive donuts instead of chasing Mater).BUT, my boys LOVE Mater and really enjoy the shows...and I appreciate that I can get dinner done since this keeps them occupied for half an hour!"
5,Your kid is obsessed with Cars too?,"My kid just turned 4 and loves these. It includes 9 episodes of Mater's Tall Tales. It does NOT include the ""Air Mater"" and ""Time Travel Mater"" shorts described in the wiki: [...]Included episodes:1. Mater The Greater (daredevil)2. Rescue Squad Mater (fire truck)3. Monster Truck Mater (wrestler)4. UFM - Unidentified Flying Mater (UFO)5. El Materdor (matador)6. Moon Mater (astronaut)7. Heavy Metal Mater (rock star)8. Mater Private Eye (detective)9. Tokyo Mater (import drifter)As of 1/28/13, the 9 episodes are on Netflix Instant Watch. I saw some on Starz VOD in 2012 but they have since been removed. Hope this helps."
5,Marvelous!,"At long last Season 2 is out! It's excellent quality, and uncut. My only gripe is this set has no ""extras"" like Season 1 has. Can't wait for the rest of the series!"
3,Nothing's missing,"The notice ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions. Some music has been changed for this home entertainment version."" listed on the back of The Odd Couple Season 2 is, thankfully, incorrect. There's no missing scenes or music substitution. Unfortunately, there are no extras, unlike the 1st season dvd set which was chuck full of bonus material. Still, if you're a fan of this series, you'll enjoy all 23 episodes of the second season. Here's hoping that CBS/Paramount get's a clue and provides some extras for the 3rd season release."
5,The Odd Couple The Second Season,"The best dvd in the world if you're an Odd Couple Fan. Enjoy night after night like in the old days on channel 11 at 11pm the Odd couple and at 11:30 the honeymooners, if you live in ny during the 70' and the 80'."
4,Good reading,"After keeping up with all the latest WH40k, it was nice to read somthing older and from authors i haven't read before. Love the short story format."
3,Nice book,"Got a lot of cool short stories, but some can be utterly boring to read. I still, however, can't find a 40k novel that shows the reality of the table top.. I mean.. they sure make space marines overly powerful(One squad can beat a bunch of scorpians and guardians with only 3-4 loses?? They only have 3+ save!!), eldar utterly [stink], and imperial guards too good to be true...Well, you might want to be a 40k mania to enjoy this, but it's a good read anyways..."
3,Good headset,"I've had this headset for a year and I'm happy with it. I got it last year for Christmas, and it's still going strong. The sound quality is great, and it fits in both my cellphone and in my wireless phone for my landline. I think if I had to complain about anything it's the part that adjusts to fit your head. Apparently I have a big head because it bends a little while I'm using it. But again, not a big deal. Highly recommended."
5,The Best Book of the Year!!,"Fellow readers, this is the most amazing piece of literature that I have read this year. ""The Angel on the Water"" is an engrossing read filled with gripping scenes of intense combat and supernatural horrors. The complex human drama kept me reading all night long and I totally sympathized with the grand cast of characters. This is one book that will sit on my shelf for a very long time. I highly recommend it to all fans of epic fantasy.The genius of David Paul Olson is reminiscent of Robert E. Howard and Karl Wagner. This young author has a promising future. We'll certainly see him again... perhaps on the cover of TIME in a few years. Hollywood should pay attention to this rising star!A great read!Zachary Miles Baddorf"
3,not so much.....,"It was not that interesting to me though I always appreciate reading about what people live through. I mean, it wasn't bad. (to read) Maybe I compare all memoirs to the Glass Castle which is not good for reviewing I suppose. There is enough of interesting shocking things to rate it as I'd recommend it just don't expect too too much."
5,An amazing story,"This is a really compelling book. For lack of a better description, it's about a post-modern triumph of the human spirit. What I especially liked is the very honest way the triumph is handled -- yes, maybe he's overcome great odds, but the victory has left scars, which are bravely addressed. It's quite a harrowing read, as should be stories of redemption, very sad but also funny -- a testament to the human gift of being able to turn almost tragedy into comedy, and the human ability to cling to the smallest ray of hope.There are many books written of course about people overcoming great odds -- what makes this one memorable is the very unique, very modern circumstances, and the humor. The descriptions of the characters are excellent and the recall of events exceptionally clear. I highly recommend this book."
5,What great fun!,"Flashback was a really fun game. My husband and I recently played this game with family and had a ball. My husband doesn't usually like to play games, but this one really got to him. We both keep talking about how much fun we had. My husband and I grew up with most of the sitcoms in this game, so it was a real blast. I can wait to run out and get this game so I get get my friends to jion in the fun!"
1,Mine's worthless,In a year I haven't managed to convince it to print a dozen pages for me. I've repeated contacted Canon about it's problems looking for help but they just try to sell me more stuff. With very solid Canon name I'm very diappointed with this.
3,missing pieces,"I ordered from white mountain puzzles because I saw the 100% guarantee. However, I bought 2 of the same exact puzzles and each one had a missing piece. After wasting my time putting a 1000-piece puzzle together, I realized that each one contained only 999. Thank you."
2,Photoshop CS QuickSteps,"For the price, this is an excellent book, but it is difficult to believe, given the market value, that any book written for a program like Photoshop would be written for the Windows platform only. The Macintosh platform is the dish of choice among artists and designers, and that the effort was not made to include Macs in this publications was a great surprise. If you are familiar with both platforms, or can make the adjustment, buy the book - if you say ""huh"" when you hear ""right click"" buy a different book."
5,Tweety Tumbler Set,"Purchased for a friend who is a Tweety Bird collector. Gift box packaging adds to appeal. Excellent service, prompt arrival of item well before due date."
2,Naughty Monkey flat,"These are really cute shoes. They are also really uncomfortable. I wear between an 8 and 8-1/2. I purchased the 8 -1/2 but should have gotten the 9.I am slowly breaking them in, but they would have been more comfortable in a size larger. The elastic cuts into my foot."
3,Alright,"The message displayed in this book was ok. I personally am not to happy that Chris is even still around. However, I enjoyed this book. I'd say that this book was 3 of 5 because it was fairly crafted. The plot was straightfoward. Those are good, however, the surprise was obvious and the message and general objective of this book was not so hot. Defenatly a read for all replica fans. For others read replicas 1-19 before and for browsers don't even try this book"
1,Worn Out,This series is worn out; there are no more fresh ideas. It was fun while it lasted but it's time to close the door on Replica.
5,Effective 8/2004 this is Consumer Report's 2nd Best Plasma,"Clearly an amazing set, and second only to the Hitachi which is over TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS more expensive. Best deal in town, people, based on testing by the most recognized non-profit consumer testing organization.This is an awesome, high quality product and I just bought two! Pay no attention to negative reviews, usually only unhappy consumers comment at all. Excellent plasma television set!I found an AMAZING wall mounting installer if you need one. My televisions are up and the sound is INCREDIBLE, way better than I expected."
2,Really Bad So Cal Service!,Poor analog picture quality regardless of source (including component input). Severe solarization from bright or reflective picture content. Spent 5 months trying to have it repaired and now it's worse! HDTV 1080i w/HDCP only works with the Samsung Direct TV Receiver. HDTV/HDCP/DVI compatability a BIG problem! Actual HDTV via DVI input looks good when I finally got it to work! These issues might be the reason that the price for this model have dropped over $1500 in the past 6 months! DON'T BUY JVC! Much better choices out there!
1,Terrible Plasma,"This plasma has great specs on paper, but actually looks terrible. The color banding and pixelation is horrible in all resolutions and formats. I tried this tv with every connection it had from multiple dvd players and a pc. The problems were obvious regardless of the source.I sent it in for repair only to hear back from JVC that it is performing within specifications, which is pretty sad considering I have a 25 year old CRT that looks better.Avoid this plasma. The specs and price may look good, but the plasma itself is horrible quality."
1,Incredibly disappointing,"Do your self a favor and don't waste your money on this poor excuse for a plasma screen. The pixilation is incredibly obvious and there are much better screens out there for a lot less money. Sony, Samsung or even Gateway would be a better choice. Compared to the set I have, a $200 CRT would be a better choice. This is a $4500 boat anchor.On top of everything else, JVC's customer service (which borders on being non-existent) is terribly rude and not helpful at all. They are unprofessional in the extreme."
3,okay,"i really have dry skin and i was hoping it was like the spa lotion and would keep my skin moist, but i would have to use alot for it to even moist my skin and it was a bit powdery. well it serve it purpose though"
3,Beware of censored version,I just bought this from Sinister Cinema and here is the long and short of it. The DVD is struck from a pristine print and is gorgeous. That's the lone good part of this review. The IMDB lists the running time at 95 minutes while the DVD clocks in at 86 minutes. Think there has been some serious editing? You bet. I compared this version to my ancient VHS dub and ALL the nudity and most of the gore has been amatuerishly edited out. You can tell by the jump cuts in the DVD print. The DVD offers only the English dubbed audio track and it is bad. You can tell they have 6 people doing all the voices. The dubbed voice of Nashy is especially miscast. I was surprised that Sinister Cinema chose this version to release as they are reknowned for presenting uncut prints in their releases. This is a disappointment and would only be useful to the Nashy completists in the crowd.
3,Good for a quick review.,"I used this book for my last few days of studying before taking the exam, and I liked the fact that the questions were quick to read and the explanation was focus and to the point. The 2003 edition is basically the same as 2000. There are more than 2000 questions. I recommend this book to be used in addition to a review book such as crush step 3, or first aid for step 3."
1,it is same as old edition but now has cd,"i tried this book(same book like old edition with cd) and i had old edition too.In this edition,nothing is new except they had 2 full test means 8 exam (each has 180 mcq)on cd (same as book) which can give u score and explanation but weak point for this edition is that (after comparing with old one),they did not change single question in this book so u knew old edition was not that great for step 3 so if u want to practice mcq on cd,this cd had almost same 1500+ mcq. they will send u same book like old edition when u buy it which include cd.thankshp"
2,Not up to parr.,"I have been using similar CH impact wrench for years. The first one lasted several years. But this new one did not work so good under load. If the screw was really tight and I had to put pressure in the back to keep the wrence from jumping, it would start to jam up and by-pass air. I had to return it and was very disappointed. Not like the old Campbell Hausfeld."
5,Comprehensive,"This book is one of the most helpful for those with fibromyalgia. Chet Cunningham is not out to sell you one specific treatment. He gives you information on many many different ideas and suggestions for you to review and try. This is very helpful because no one treatment is going to help every single person. Another great thing about this book is that he writes it in a simple fashion. So, if you suffer from fibro fog you can still understand what he is telling you! I highly recommend this book to people with fibromyalgia, I doubt you will regret reading it."
2,Not so great,"The first lines of this book are: ""First, I am not a doctor. I am a person interested in fibromyalgia"". So one shouldn't be surprised that the book is NOT written very well nor is it remotely near expert, sound advice. It is written by a ""person interested in fibromyalgia"", who maybe did research, but most likely not and is writing the book for either idiots or 2 year olds. The book has mildly interesting points, but cannot be taken seriously and, in fact, glosses over some SERIOUSLY dangerous practices of mixing medications!!! Pass this book up and get one WRITTEN BY A DOCTOR or a FIBROMYLAGIA EXPERT!!!. After-all, would you have open heart surgery done by a guy who is ""interested in the subject"" or by an educated, certified and tested heart surgeon? Just saying......"
4,Fibro Book,This book was shipped on time and was also received on time. The book did not have any damage to it.
2,ok,ok not the most interesting or secure journal but maybe suitable for younger kids kind of boring though and not the most durable
1,Password Invalid!,"No matter how many adults tried to set up this Password Jornal, it did not open at my granddaughter's voice.Four different adults sat with her, read the directions and waited while she spoke her password.We changed batteries and tried evreything we could think of.When she discussed this with her classmates, eaveryone had the same story. The Password Journal simply does not work.We returned it to a local Toys R Us."
1,I coudn't open it!,"After I put my password in I closed it and tried it out. I said my password over and over again but it kept saying password denied, password denied and it would not open. It is to secure!I wouldn't recomend this."
3,How it won't work!,My dad bought me one of Password Journal and when I tried to open it it won't work!
1,Piece of Crap,"My daughter received this for Christmas and has only been able to open it a couple of times. ""Access Denied"" is all we ever hear. It is easy enough to create a new password, but getting the journal to recognize it is another story. Don't wast your money, my daughter, her friends, and her cousin all own this and have a better time making fun of this stupid toy than they do using it."
4,A Few Times Every Month,"Well,I like this toy alot but it has it's ups and downs. Like when I got it on my birthday,May 6,I was so exited I wanted use it right away. So I opened it and read the directions and got it working and then I put some stuff in it. The next day I went to open it again and it did not open so I waited till the evening and tried again. I got a little frustrated and so I went in a quiet room and tried again and it worked. So I Have a few ideas that you might want to try if you have been having some troubles with your Password Journal 3,1.ALWAYS BE IN A QUIET ROOM.2.ALWAYS USE A LOW VOICE WHEN YOU SAY YOUR PASSWORD.3.WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR PASSWORD BE SURE YOU SAY A SHORT ONE. I still have a few problems with it but when I use these tips I have an easier time with it and I have faith in it to work perfectly soon!!!!!!!"
2,"Good-looking product, poor privacy.,","You might want to buy this journal that claims to keep your secrets safe and only opens to the correct owner's voice and password, but it has very poor privacy. Not only that, but I also agree with ivanx that it almost never opens to your voice (and often will open to someone else's voice, even when you have it on ""high privacy"" mode).Any no-brainer would be able to open the object by opening it just enough to hit the 'change password' button with a pencil or pointed object, and change the password and hack in. Or, they could just stick the key that goes with it in, and it unlocks. With just a regular diary, you only need the KEY to get in.Don't go for this type of journal, if you want your secrets safe. You're better off with a regular diary. But me? I won't write my secrets anywhere now that I've learned--as you can never be sure that they're 100% safe and someone will blab them out! :)"
1,Frustrating,"I agree with many other reviews. This ""toy"" was on the top of my niece's Wish List and she couldn't get it to work 99% of the time. It DID work on MY voice once, but that doesn't do HER any good. Great concept, lousy manufacturing. Needed better quality control before going on the market. It's not worth the price tag!"
1,Absolutely worthless!!&*!,"This whole product line is of very poor quality. Both the Journal and the Keepsafe Box worked properly maybe twice. After that, we had to keep resetting the unit just to open it. I would say that the Radica company needs to put a little more money into their voice recognition mechanism if they want to continue marketing this product line."
2,Cheep,"The password journal 3 is cheep! I got it for Christmas and after I set a password and closed it, I tried opening it again but it wouldn't open. I tried it at least 10 more times to open it, but eventually I just reset it. After that I always kept it open. It was really dumb, but there were alot of places to put things. It was OK, but not the best."
4,Great or not so great,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS SOMETIMES ITS GREAT I CAN GET IT OPEN USUALLY AND IF I CANT THEN I CAN POP IT OPEN.BAD THING IF I CAN POP IT OPEN MY FRIENDS AND FAM CAN SO I CANT REALL WRITE PERSONAL STUFF IN IT.YOU ALSO DO NOT HAVE MUCH ROOM TO WRITE AND EVEN THOUGH I SAID I USUALLY GET IT OPEN WELL WHEN IT DOESNT IT IS ANNOYING!I DONT HAVE A RECCOMENDATION BECAUSE IT IS COOL AND WORKS FINE FOR ME BUT IT IS ALSO A PIECE OF JUNK!AS I SAID I CAN BARELY RIGHT IN THEIR AND IT GETS OLD I BARELY USE IT ANYMORE!SO IF YOU BUY IT AND IT DOESNT WORK I WOULDNT BE SUPRISED!
1,HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS TOY. When you set-up your password, it only responds to your voice. O.K., then when you try to open it you spend 10 minutes tring to get it to open ( or right.) And you have to have the exact same voice. So you have to pull to get it open. And the privcey is not high. So insted of getting this, why don't you get the kind with the locks and keys. MUCH more privcey. And a nother thing, when the paper runs out,I tried useing reg. paper,but it will fall out. This also seems pricey,(thats what I think.) But I do like the gel pen. (Becase blue is my favrite color.) I like that you can put whatever you want on the cover. I am 8, and i do not recomend this toy."
2,Fun To Break Into!!!!,"My sister got this toy for her 10th birthday. When she made her password she was so proud because she thought nobody could get in. I (the mean older sister) tried to say the password; the first time I couldn't break in. She was so smug so I tried again and I got in! This toy isn't good for anybody during the time their voice changes. If you love breaking into somebody's privacy then tell your sister, brother, or friend to get this toy so you can try to break in."
2,MONICA JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA,"I was so exited to get this toy . But the securaty was WAY TO HIGH . I could barly open it,my fingers got sore trying to open it because the voice box would never work.I do not reccomend this toy."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TOY,"I wish I could have given this NO STARS. My daughter got this 2 and a half months ago. It was fine at first but then it started acting wierd, not opening, wouldnt recognize her voice. Then it quit working one day. Just stopped,wouldnt do a darn thing. I changed the batteries, NOTHING happened. I pressed the reset button, it still wouldnt do anything. It refuses to work. So I called Radica Games.....and guess what they told me....""well send it to us and if we cant figure out whats wrong with it, we will send you a new one"". So, not only did I have to pay 20 dollars for it, now I have to pay for shipping to send it back to them. I am just going to throw it out. I will get her a REAL journal. And I can say this...I will never buy anything from Radica games again."
1,HORRIBLE,"I purchased this toy for my daughter for her 10th birthday even after reading the reviews. That was a bad decision. This toy is too complicated for a child as it does not allow any variations in the environment (i.e., background noise, tone of voice, etc.) This toy can be frustrating to say the least. The only positive aspect about this toy was that it did not allow anyone other than my daughter to enter the password journal. That is when it allowed her to enter."
1,Access Not Granted,"The Password Journal turned out to be our worse Christmas gift purchase. After the initial password setup, access was continually denied. It appears that the voice recognition system does not work properly. We are definitely returning it to Toys R Us!!! Buyer beware!!!!"
1,very poor,"when ever you get a password to even work, the next time you put it in it doesn't work right!! i would not buy this for anyone!"
1,Sara,This toy has never worked!!! It refuses to accept my password even in a quiet room. My mom got it to work one time but it hasn't worked since. I've had it since Christmas and can't even play with it. What a waste! It isn't even worth the one star I gave it. It's totally useless!
1,Don't bother,"This journal is a waste of money. My daughter wanted this so badly, but it is impossible to get in. We have changed the password several times, tried many different words, been very careful to repeat exactly and NOTHING WORKS. It's a good idea, but badly executed. This toy has caused nothing but frustration."
1,disappointed,"My 8 year old daughter wanted this SO bad. She got it for the holidays, she was thrilled. We got it all set up right away. Well, to get the thing opened, it won't let her get in. We have to keep resetting the thing. We have even re-done it to our voice (being our cell phones are like that) and it doesn't match voices very well. I wouldn't reccomend this item. Idea is good, but it is too difficult to open for anybody."
1,"Not as expect, very disappointed!","My 9 year old daughter received this for his birthday a couple weeks ago! And I agree with some of the other reviews, IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE! We had to keep resetting it and trying again (my daughter still has the screwdriver in her room)!It looks cute, but not worth the money. Too bad because it's really a neat idea! She was so excited to receive it but now it's been tucked under her bed with the rest of the misfit toys."
1,DON'T BUY ITS THE WORST!!! AND YOUR CHILD GETS SO SAD!,This toy was one of the worst toys we have ever bought. When you say you password and then try to open it it never works. Kids have a hard time making their voice right each and every time.And by the way the person who wrote about sitting next to a piano...Please....not everyone has pianos.We tried for over a hour to make this work. My duaghter was SO disappointed.its junk.You would only want to buy this if you would like to drive your worst enemy insane. Even then it might not be worth it!
1,NOT PLEASENT,I HAVE ONE BUT I STILL CAN'T OPEN IT.IF YOU MADE IT MORE EASIER MAYBE I COULD OPEN IT. SO MAYBE IF YOU USED A KEY TO LOCK IT AND OPEN IT. IT BE BETTER FOR ME AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T OPEN IT. AND THEY HAVE TO USE A NIFE TO OPEN IT.
3,Voice activation too sensitive,"My daughter REALLY wants to play with this, but she cannot open it as the voice activiation is super sensitive, and denies access unless you say the exact same way, which is hard for an 8 year old.!!"
2,I HATE THIS JOURNAL!(...),(...) I was so excited I got it. My password was my crushes last name it didn't work several times. Then it worked it was really cool inside. I shut it and put it away but my older sister wanted to see it. I couldn't get it still so I was already mad but then it opened. A couple hours later my younger sister game home and wanted to see it. It wouldn't work so i'm returning it and getting my money back. I MADE A VERY STUPID MISTAKE!(...)
1,If it's anything like Password Journal 2 it sucks.,We bought Password Journal 2 last year. I can't believe they came out with another one. The voice password is very sensetive that it wont recgonize the voice if there is noise in the background even if you think there is no noise. We have to keep taking out the batteries to get it to open. Not worth the money. To much of a headache to get it to work and then it doesn't.
1,Don't buy this journal,"I wish I would have read these reviews before my daughter saved and saved to get this journal. She finally had the necessary money and was so excited and the thing just won't open. You have to say the password exactly the way it was recorded. If your inflection is a little off then it won't open. If a fly is buzzing somewhere in the house and wasn't when you recorded the word it won't open. The best advice I can give is don't buy this dumb toy. If you have and don't want to return it, there is a little reset button inside a hole next to the battery case on the back. Stick a pin inside it, the journal will open and you can try reseting the password. Also, make sure that the security setting inside the password is on low. If you don't like to see your kids frustrated to tears, don't buy it. Maybe it would be a good gift for the class bully."
2,Buy A Different Product,I bought Password Journal after I bought it for my friend for her birthday. It was working fine until she tried to open it up. She tried it for around 12-20 times to get it open. When she got it open the diary was on high secerity! What kind of person would put a diary for children that is $20.00 on high secerity when they just buy it so they can't even get it open. When I bought it I set the password and let my little brother try to open it. He opened it with his own bare hands! So do not spend all that money on this so-called diary and get a lock diary that cost twice as less. Who needs all that tecno stuff on a diary anyway.
1,Extemely Frustrating,The voice password almost NEVER works. My daughter finds it extremely frustrating and has choosen a traditional diary over this one. It now collects dust. She was very disappointed as this was high on her Christmas wish list and now proves useless.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I bought this for my 9 year old daughter--from day 1 she was disappointed despite the fact that it was high on her Christmas list. Her voice can never seem to operate the secret password function. It is not durable, either. We have to leave it unlocked for her to even use it. We returned the first one thinking it was defective and had the same problem with the second one. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Don't buy this,"My 9 year old daughter was so happy to get this toy, but has just told me to throw it out the window. The voice command does not work. The only way to open it is to hit the reset button that is in the battery compartment, that you need a screw driver to open. We have done this drill about 100 times. We're done!"
4,Found a workaround to the voice recognition issue...,"A little difficult to get the password sounding right and my daughter lost patience before I found the ""security"" setting switch (not sure how much of a difference that would make).Anyway, my digital tape recorder is hers now and she just replays the recording of the password, works like a charm (not one failure).Other than this little snag, a very neat toy."
2,Very Disappointing,"My 8 yr. old daughter was so excited to purchase this item, but what a huge disappointment it was after getting it home. She has only been able to open the journal a couple of times because of the ultra sensitive voice activating password system. She has repeatedly uttered her password the same way hundreds of times, and only periodically does it unlock and open as it is suppose to. I would not recommend purchasing this journal as your child will become extremely frustrated over it's improper password function."
1,A Piece Of Junk,"This toy is a piece of junk.It is hard to get open and it gets boring after a while.Being a preteen I expect this toy to be made better,and more fun"
4,It's good/ok,"The toy is ok but I can open it with out saying the password, I just pull it open. So if you have a little or older brother or sister who wants to read it then they can if they really try to."
4,Very Entertaining,"I got this for a trip and it was really cool. When I put my password in it works, but it is VERY hard to get in. You have to use the EXACT voice you used to set it. All but that it is so cool. It has a built in light and they have this mini photo stand that you could put in it and record your own voice but it is sold sepertly. This is FUN."
4,It's a WINNER at our home!,"We had the same troubles as most of you who gave this item 3 or less stars. We just kept with it and soon enough... my 8 year old daughter (with my help) figured out how do open this thing, every single time.1. Make sure the password is a short, 1 syllable word. Tell your child to sit in a quiet room when recording and remember to say it exactly the same way, every time.2. Set the security to LOW. We set it to high and never got it open! If all else fails, find the RESET button in the battery compartment.3. Keep it in her room! That's where temptation sets in for other siblings. My son and I have since tried to open the thing because she has kept it in the livingroom... and it lets her know how many ""intruders"" tried while she was gone.This is a neat little toy. I admit the technology could be improved, but for $20, it's a pretty neat little gadget."
1,Bad...,"Okay, Where shall I begin... Okay I'm 13 years old and the key and lock diary kept on getting broken into, so I got the marvelous password journal. I was excited, I set my password opened it up decorated it and everything and closed it. Then I tested it. I could not get this thing to work! It wanted the exact same pattern, the exact same noise levels and everything in you password. So unless you're capable of making your voice sound monotone, don't buy this."
4,Don't give up!,"My daughter (7 years old), got this toy for Christmas. She was so excited and then very disappointed. It took three adults, several days, and about 50 resets to finally get it working consistently. The first password was DOG, which never worked. It think the sound was too generic. As soon as she changed the password to MOMMY, it seemed to work instantly. Now it opens every time, and only for her. I've tried, and her 11 year old brother has tried, to no avail. So, as the other reviews mention, it must be very quiet and said exactly the same way, but now she is thrilled and is writing away!"
1,Save your money,"As with the other reviews previously written, this toy has major problems with the password. My daughter constantly was resetting the password because it refused to let her in. It was a frustrating experience for both of us. Save your money...this toy is not worth $19.99. Heck...I wouldn't even buy it for $5.00."
1,I can't believe how horrible this works!,I purchased a Password Journal when they first came out around 8 years ago for my oldest daughter. It came with a key then so you could open it when your password would not work...I WISH this new model had the same thing. My youngest daughter got Password Journal 3 and she could not get it to recognize her password. I listened as she recorded it and she said it the same way everytime and it still would not recognize it. It is very durable though...I ended up throwing it against the wall!!!! They should give you another way to enter without having to open the back and reset over and over and over and over!! Bring back the key!!!
1,SORRY I BOUGHT IT !!!!!!!!!,"I bought password journal for my daughter ( she's 8 ) I thought it would be a cool gift, and my daughter had it on her wish list for christmas. We set up her personal pass code and she had fun with it till she closed it.That was in December !!!! and its been closed ever since. It's now May and she has not been able to access it again.I am so upset with this product i could scream. My daughter cries every time she tries to open it because it will not take her voice command.....Voice activated my foot... IS THIS PRODUCT SOME KIND OF JOKE !!! SOMETHING TO MESS WITH CHILDRENS MINDS... NOT TO MENTION THE FRUSTRATION THE PARENTS HAVE TO GO THRU TRYING TO OPEN THE STUPID THING. If i still had the package it came in i would return it A.S.A.P !!!!!!!!!!!! Note: To the parent that said it will open using a sharp object ( THANK YOU ) I am going to try that tonight maybe my daughter wont cry today."
2,Hard to get in,I give the money to my mother to buy it and when I got it it was hard to open.I got it July 8 and it is still hard to opeen.But some times it open.This toy is very much durable.I will give you the news on my Passward Journal 3.
2,THE WORST TOY I HAVE EVER HAD!,"I spent 19.99 of my money on this peice of junk. The first few hours worked Ok because we used my friends voice to set the time, date and alarm. Then I decided to press the reset button and start over. The password process worked fine then when the journal asks you if you would like to set the time I said yes. It thought that I said no. I tried using everyone in my families voice to see if they would work. My dads was the only that worked! I think this product is very durable because it held up when I threw it across the room."
1,disapointed:'l not so fun,I just bought the password journal.I know its a waste of money. It doesnt do anything.If you are planing to buy it as a scrap book dont cause it doesnt even look like one! it doesnt have space.besides the other stuff like the pencil shredder and the scrap book are sold separately and are 10 bucks each!
1,Too Frustrating for Children!!!,"My daughter is 12 years old and was very excited to get this toy. However, it is now collecting dust as she cannot open the journal no matter how hard she tries. I got frustrated having to unscrew the battery compartment to reset the password. Terribly frustrating! This toy will be returned."
1,Waste of twenty dollars for a hanukkah present !,I got this toy on the 28th with 20 dollars from my grandma at the store. I thought it looked really cool! After my dad got it to record we closed it. I put in my password over and over but it didn't work!And I used 20 dollars! I'm definitely bringing it back to the store!
1,Cheap Plastic Junk,"I really wanted this toy. I got it. It was really Bad.the thing never gets the voice right, and it is impossible to get it to open on your voice. Anyway, nosy brothers can get in it anyway because of the reset button. Don't bother.However I would like to add that someone's tip about a piano was very good and that if you have a pioano then maybe buy the thing. Maybe."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!,"The voice activated password system does not work! The child gets into it once, uses up the 25 cent pad of paper, and then you spend days trying to record a password that works with zero success! Since it is used, it cannot be returned to amazon.com. Twenty dollars down the drain! Very unethical sale, toy should be pulled off the market until it is improved!"
1,Just another marketing ploy,It is very very hard to change the password on this device. Paper inside is just a simple pad. My daughter has a hard time to get the password to work.
1,Poorly advertised jump rope,"This jump rope is so poorly constructed and lightweight, it should be described as being for kids six and under NOT adults."
4,Like the jumprope I had in school,These reminded me of the jump ropes that we had in gym class in elementary school. My son likes it and wanted one.
1,Rand McNally World Map---never received it,"We ordered the Rand McNally World Map in mid December, it said it had been shipped, and we still have not received it. We are planning on cancelling the order from our credit card."
5,Rand Mcnally World Map,A great Map with vibrant color and nice size. This map is perfect and has alot of nice detail too.
2,Looks Like Ink Jet,"I bought a similar Rand McNally ""classic edition"" map of the U.S. from a local office supply store. It looked really nice, so I ordered this map of the world. The one I received looks like an ink jet printout from an engineering roll printer on cheaper paper. It's not horrible, but it's not as attractive as the U.S. map I bought from a local office supply store."
5,Gorgeous map!,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to maps, especially ones that I want to hang on the wall. This looks fantastic in my office and ads a touch of class. The classic, antique feel on parchment paper adds a very nice touch. Buy this without hesitation."
5,My new world map poster,I love this poster. For some reason I have wanted a world map poster for a few months now and after searching endlessly for something that appealed to me I found this one. It looks great and is current enough.
4,Good Map,"I'm very pleased with my map, but I would like to mention that you can purchase a laminated one for just a few dollars more. I bought my map and then took it to staples to have it laminated, for the price I paid I could have bought the laminated map too, and still saved money. But the map is great, now I can look at places when I see them on tv or they come up in conversation."
3,Outstanding value for $10 bucks! Buy it.,"Colorful and pleasing to the eye, yet has an ""aged"" look around the edges. Would be gorgeous with a wooden frame. very large (32""x50""). Very good details on physical features like rivers, mountain ranges, lakes. Paper is pretty thin.Centered on Europe and Africa, with the Pacific Ocean split down the middle. This makes more sense anyway. Slight overlap (about 10degrees longitude) at the east and west edges of the map. Europe and the Middle east get pretty crowded and there aren't as many labels there, but the terrain deatures are still there.Concerning distortion--I don't know anything about cartography, but for $10 who cares. You might want to consider the degree of distortion.I posted this map right above kitchen table and use it very often, whenever a place gets mentioned that I'm not familiar with. and it makes a perfect conversation piece."
4,Very nice print !,"I have bought 3 world maps, by far this is the best one, very nice colors and quality, gives an impression of old style maps, but with current political status."
3,Looks like used,If that's what they mean 'classic edition'... The paper looks as if decades old and ready to crack at any moment.
5,This was the map I was looking for,"The map is well designed and stately, it really exceeded my expectations. However, my map arrived slightly damaged with bent corners."
3,Damaged,"The bottom part of the poster was crushed upon arrival, which wrinkled the bottom of my map."
4,"WHATEVER, IT'S PRETTY COOL","the price is good, the map is goodenjoy your days, and your life will be goodjames"
2,Installation Software CD Problems,"If the product includes PLC5e software the install CD will hang on the Windows XP operating system. An attempt to use the CHAT facility of the HP Support website will result in a reply that ""this product is no longer supported"". If one digs deeper into the trouble shooting messages for this product one of the messages suggests deleting the file 'hpcdmc32.dll'. This does not solve the installation hang. Another message directs one to use the Windows 'Add Printer' task found in Settings --> Printers and Faxes as an alternative to using the Install CD. This allows the Printer function to be connected to the PC but it leaves out the Scan setup and the HP ToolboxFX software.HP should be ashamed to provide a ""Getting Started Guide"" which tells users to use the included CD to install the software. They should also be ashamed to tell users that the CHAT facility no longer supports this product. If any of the HP products need all the support it can get it's this one."
1,Beware of HP Printers - No Support for Main Stream OSes,Purchased laserjet 3055 printer December 2007. Box said it was Vista ready. Purchased a new Dell laptop with Vista Home Premium 64 bit one year later. HP does not provide software compatible with Vista 64 bit to scan and fax. HP misleads customers in their advertising and they don't support their products. Considering class action lawsuit because there are many customers who have been defrauded.
1,NO WINDOWS 7 SUPPORT FOR SCANNER,"The printer is great. HP Support is not.Beware that they have issued a statement that they will not support this printer with Windows 7.While you can get the printer to work in Windows 7, the scanner will not be available or supported.So, what was a great multifunction printer turns into a boat anchor.HP seems more intereted in getting you to purchase new product thatn supporting their existing products."
2,Would Not Recommend,"I've had three HP multifunction machines. Thinking that HP improved their products, I have purchased two 3055 multifunction systems as an ""upgrade"" in the past three years. The first one failed after two years; the printing function went down. This third system, and my last, quit faxing a few days ago after less than one year since purchase. A loud noise comes on when the fax button is pushed and although it dials the fax number, it is never connects and the fax fails. I've had the same problem with tech support as previous reviewers. They are friendly and try to help but the problem is never fixed. I will now purchase a cheap fax and a reliable laser printer (not HP)."
2,Anoying noise,"OK, I've had this machine for over a year now and I'm just about to smash it. This machine emits a humming noice that is so annoying. I read about it before buying it and assumed that the reviewer was over reacting. He wasn't. Sure it prints and faxes fine, but shouldn't it? What it shouldn't do is emmit this horribly annoying noise. Don't fool yourself and think that it won't bother you. IT WILL"
3,Canon Basic Guide for MF 4150,While I have not fully used all of the Canon features I find the Basic guide to be very confusing.
2,Still can not get Hp 3055 to work in windows workgroup network,"I bought this 2 weeks ago. Firstly the software that comes with it is HEAVY almost like waiting for 30 minutes on XP to complete. It printed documents from my Dell Inspirion 1501 with XP Home Edition. I have had been struggling to get it to work with other PC's (with XP) on the windows network. I did assign a static IP 192.168.0.7 to HP3005 in the config.The HP documentation for HP3055 did not address this anywhere. The printer is not found by any PC on the network, even thou, I have shared iut from my laptop.Still looking for solution. HP software team is real pathatic. I am still struggling to find an answer. Please help!Best-bharatBoston"
1,Buyer Beware,"Last week,my printer died on me and I had to purchase another printer ASAP. I bought this model down at my local Staples store and tried to install it the next day. Now I am no expert on computers but when I added the software and then tried to use my computer to print (a Dell XP) it crashed. I now have to fix the problems that this crash did to my computer.When I went back to return it, the manager said that they have been having problems with this happening because they think it has something to do with the software. I took the time to write this for anyone out there who is considering buying this model. BE CAREFUL!"
1,It *Doesn't* Work In Vista!!!,"I don't care if HP claims it's ""certified for Vista,"" there's a very good chance it won't work in Vista.I had this product and I love it...worked great in XP. But since switching to Vista, I've had huge problems. Right now in my home office, it's not working on two machines, and on the machine that printing is working on, scanning doesn't work.I've downloaded the latest Vista software from the HP site, btw. But HP's tech-support staff have told me that there are ""issues"" with Vista, and that it might not work. So I'd be very wary about buying this machine if you're planning on using it in Vista. It may be fine...but it may not!"
3,"Does the job, except for that light.","I bought the cradle for use with my Tungsten T3. It does the job; it's solid enough that it doesn't slide around on my desk, and guides the T3 to the connection port with little effort. My only complaint is that while the white LED glow that emanates from the base looks nice, I find it somewhat annoying. As an LED, it doesn't generate any noticeable heat and I'm sure that it draws very little power; still, it's a feature I'd like to be able to disable without having to unplug the AC adapter."
4,Just wanted a good price..got it!,"Re; PalmOne P10961U Mini Cradle USBSorry, but it is just a USB PALM cradle. It works, I'm using it and the price was good."
4,"Well done, but very dated","I'm sure this book was indispensable when it was new, but with the information now over 12 years old, it's very dated. Even so, it still offers valuable information that will be helpful, even to the current day aircraft buyer, such as ""break-up"" problems with V-Tail Beech aircraft or skin problems with some of the Cessnas. I would love to see a newer edition from the same author, but I don't think your research would be complete without some sort of newer reference in hand."
2,"Historically interesting, Romantically? Not so hot.","First of all, I must say that I found the book to be very interesting historically and from almost a mystery viewpoint, intriguing. But I didn't buy the relationship between the hero and heroine. If you're the type that likes sensual love scenes..this is NOT the book for you. They barely go beyond a kiss anywhere in the book. I was disappointed by the lack of ""sparks"", but the end was gripping and tension filled."
4,Great Little Pump,I got this pump to drain my 3500 gallon pool before fall. It stated that it would do 3000 GPH and that is not the case. It took almost 3 hours to pump out the water. I was using the 1 1/4 hose with it. Over all well built easy to use and did work just not at 3000 GPH like it stated.
1,Not for Ponds,"I purchased this submersible pump to replace another utility pump that had operated for 3 years plus in my small water garden. This pump has never been run dry as I have it installed in a skimmer box. I purchashed this pump in July 2009 and it has stopped working less than 3 months after installing. I contacted Wayne Water systems to ask why this pump is going bad. They stated that this is not a pond pump and is not rated for Continuous-Duty. However if you look on their website the RUP160 states ""Continuous-Duty Pump You Can Take Anywhere"". If you perform a search of ""Water Garden"" on their site there are 10+ pumps that come up to include the RUP160. I would not buy another product from Wayne Water systems as they have failed to honor their year warranty."
1,description discrepancy,"technical details and product title state ""3,000 GPH"" but the product description states ""2,000 GPH."" So, which is it??"
1,waste of money,"This is my first review. I never do reviews, but this product is so bad it is worth a review. First off, it does not pump 2,000 GPH (that's 33.33 gpm or a little over half a gallon a second threw a 3/4 inch opening (that's the size of your mouth while drinking)). The pump size is too small to do that. Second off, look at the photo of the pump, do you see were the garden hose goes? While, if you leave that valve pointed up (without a water hose) it won't even pump water (that is how weak the pump is). The only benefit is the pump is quite. I used the pump to clear out water from a rain build up (only 12 feet away going down hill to pump the water out). The pump could not pump the water out."
3,Misleading ad,"The pump works fine with a garden hose but is a little slow as I knew it would be, no complaint there. But the ad said that you could add a 1-1/2"" hose to the pump for faster operation. They even had a picture of the pump and the hose with the caption ""buy both for""... So I ordered both. The trouble is the outlet of the pump is 1-1/4"" and the hose is 1-1/2"". They did not include an adaptor, so the hose is useless. It would not be worth the trouble and postage to send it back so I will go to Lowes or Home Depot and try to put together a makeshift adaptor.I like the pump itself and the only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is because of the mismatch between the pump outlet and the hose."
5,Great Pump,"I bought this pump to empty the spa, having never done this before I was not sure what to expect. After ordering and using this pump I am very pleased."
2,broke down in a year of use in a fountain,i have bought several of these over the years- all break in a year.......i was told does not work long in clorinated water
3,slow to rise,"this little pump does a good job.i ran it over night,none stop,14 hrs.,and she keeps pumping water. fair price too."
4,Great pump!,"I used this pump to drain an inground spa/jacuzzi. I used the garden hose attachment and a 100 foot garden hose. Was a little skeptical because of some of the reviews. Submerged the pump and it worked well. Water came out of the hose at a good rate. Probably the same rate as turning the hose on full blast from the house faucet. It took 2 hours to drain the spa. A lot faster than syphoning it. Decent pump for a great price...I would give it 5 stars if it were a lot faster, but it still did the job well..."
4,Wayne 3000 GPH Sump.,"The Wayne RUP 160 1/6 HP 3000 GPH seems to do the job. Have a Wayne 2500 GPH and side by side, the 2500 seems to do a better job overall. I have 3 of each working for me and every time, the 2500 just seems to do it faster. The 3000 GPH is not bad and have had no problems with it but for my application the 2500 did it better.Delivery was quick and easy as always with AMAZON."
4,Nice handy little pump,"I purchased this pump to remove the water on my pool cover and for work related pumping. Worked very well other that an occasional clogging but were talkin some nasty junk leaves, debris, etc. Had to remove the 4 screws and clean it out about 3 times but I'm not blaming the pump at all. Pumped my daugthers kiddie pool out a couple times and worked great. I used about a 15' foot garden hose and there was some nice pressure comming out, Good Flow. The pump needs to be started in at least 3-4 inches of water or else it wont prime. You cannot plug the pump in and dump it into the water it air locks and wont pump. It needs to placed in the water first then plugged in. It will pump down to at least 1/4 inch of water maybe more. I didn't bust out the tape measure. I agree I would like it have a switch on the cord that would make the pump worthy of 5 stars."
3,Understand What your getting.,"Please note that this pump needs a minimum 1 1/2"" of water before it can prime and begin pumping. Also note that discharge port connector sold with the Wayne Pumps 66000-WYN1 1-1/2-Inch-by-24-Foot Sump Discharge Hose Kit with Clamps does not fit into the discharge port. Adaptor with this hose kit is the wrong size for this pump. Consider using a simple garden hose for small jobs."
2,Amazon screwup,Bought this before hurricane Irene and thankfully did not need to use it. I have a pond in my yard and in the spring I will use this to lower the pond level to avoid flooding. The problem I have is that Amazon recommends the wrong size hose to go with the pump. Simple but stupid error that they (Amazon/Wayne) will not fix as this has been written about before. Do the research and get the right hose.
3,Not for pool patio,"Just received my order for the Wayne 1/6 HP utility pump. My intended use was for standing water on a paver patio pool deck. However, after reading the instructions which were enclosed, it is NOT recommended around pools,with no safety cut off switch, probably not a good idea. In any event, when heavy rainsarrive patio has standing water, slow to run off and I thought it would be of use for this cause. However, with a short power cord to run from the power sourceit could be a problem (safety)as reaching the power plug one may have to be in contact with water....also not in the ad but in the instructions, not for usein water less than 1/2inch. The pump itself looks well made but won't be the right pump for my use."
2,frequently bought together?,"I guess I should of read the previous reviews before purchasing this pump with the ""frequently bought together"" 1 1/2 hose. After receiving both items I realized that I would have to make a trip to the hardware store to buy some reducers and couplings to make this pump work with the hose. Besides wasting my time and money at the hardware store, the pump did work fine once I had it set up with the 1 1/2 hose."
3,The Amazon-recommended hose is the wrong size!,"This review is not for the pump - the pump seems fine and works OK when used with a garden hose. Unfortunately, I purchased the pump together with the Wayne 1 1/2"" discharge hose that Amazon advertises as ""frequently bought with"" the pump. Amazon does not mention that the hose is incompatible with the pump since the pump requires a 1 1/4"" discharge hose.I found this out during a heavy storm when the pump discharging through the garden hose was not able to keep up with the water flowing into my catch basin. I've ordered the 1 1/4"" hose and just want to make sure that others are aware that the Amazon-promoted hose DOES NOT WORK with this pump."
2,No power,"Don't expect to get more than 2-300 GPH if you use 50' of garden hose. Even with 1' of rise, this pump has poor pressure and moves very little water. Perhaps if you were to purchase the large, much more expensive specialty hose it would work better."
5,Very powerful,"Love this little pump. I bought it to flush my tankless water heater and was surprised how well it works. If I had a basement, I wouldn't hesitate to throw this little pump at it if were flooded. Don't waste your money buying one of those overpriced flush kits. Buy this pump and the hoses. Does the job at a fraction of the cost."
3,Not as good as they used to be,"I use this pump to empty my hot tub. It empties my 350 gallon tub in 20-30 minutes. About 15 years ago I had the same pump which I used to drain my hot tub at my old house but I left it with the new owner and bought this new pump for the new tub. The old pump would drain down to 1/8 of an inch of water before losing its prime. The new pump takes longer to prime and loses its prime easily with a1/2"" of water remaining. If I remove the hose and manually prime, I can get it down to 1/4"". It' just not sa good as they used to be. It is okay but I would not buy another one. My neighbor bought a craftsman and his is much better."
2,Terrible!,"Pump never did work wonderfully, was hard to get it to pump many times! It has died after a year and a half. Wasted money!"
3,No automatic switch,I'm giving this a lower rating because I didn't realize it doesn't have an automatic turn on/off switch. I guess my mistake for not realizing it when I ordered. I bought a zoeller m53 and I guess I'll keep this for a manual backup.
3,Seems like a good idea.,"I bought this to try to organize my fridge a little better. They are a good idea and they do work well as far as rolling forward to retrieve items. However, they don't hold much. You really can't get the bottles of pickles and condiments more than one across. They just won't fit. They just need to make this a bit wider."
5,The true sound of the 60s revolution.....remains mostly overlooked.,"The sound of John Cippolina's vibrato-bar SG guitar is beautiful, icy, stark, and frightful. It best conveys the mood of that time in Frisco. Just listen to 'The Fool'."
2,Soft Mink Blanket,"The blanket was not as soft as I would have liked or as heavy. The packaging for the blanket was ripped open in 3 spots even though it was packed again in a box, so I must assume that it was not well cared for or it had been previously sold to someone else."
2,beautiful when it arrived,"i am on the second wash now, it leaves fuzzy's everywhere but in the dryer where they should be! the fuzz balls are annoying!"
4,Warm Blanket,Very nice size and weight. The only reason I dropped a star was because I had to clean off all the fuzzies that the blanket had from the factory from other colored blankets. And the price was good.
5,Best Blanket Ever,"Not for use by kids. The care of this blanket is hard and I wouldnt recommend being done often but i found using Dryel spot remover works for small spills (not putting it in the dryer, just using the fabric cleaner) and letting air out and using fabric refresher works great. It is warm and so confortable to curl up in. It is thin but kept me quite warm. I got this for a friend's guest bed to use while i visited, now i am getting one for my own bed."
1,Traditional Korean blanket MADE IN CHINA!!!,"So, I lived in Korea for over a year (stationed there in 2002). I have owned a few blankets from there and I can say that this is not a ""traditional"" korean blanket. This is on par with those really thin ones for children (I got my son a sponge bob one when I was there). I still have an actual korean mink blanket that is one-ply and a monk robe from 2002. The blanket has been washed 100 times and the robe maybe a dozen. This one is thinner than my current blanket and is no where near as thick as the robe (both were the same thickness at one point).It will make a good living room blanket, not a bed blanket.The blanket is really soft and will be warm, but not winter warm like the ones I got while in Korea. I am very disappointed with my purchase, but those are the risks of online shopping."
5,Favorite Blanket,"This lightweight blanket is like having a fur coat over you! It's toasty warm, well-made, and we liked it so much we got a spare just in case somebody comes to visit!"
4,Very plus,"I love this blanket very much. HOWEVER, I didn't know that you couldn't use in dryer. Has some strange washing instruction, letting it sit in the washer for 3 hours and then hang out to dry. The problem is I live in an apartment and don't have anyplace to line dry, so I'm not sure what I'm going to do when it gets dirty.But it's very cozy!"
5,"This book has changed my life, and I recommend it to everyone.","This book has changed my life, and I recommend it to everyone. Please. Please. Please read this book. I know this book was sent to me and you for a reason. This is an easy read, fascinating, and so informative. I can't imagine going through life one more day without it. Thank you Ann Gadd, for helping us to all be better people with a greater understanding of ourselves. Bravo!!!"
4,First-rate Song Selection,"This CD is only the best of the best from the latter half of Gladys & The Pips's career. As it was said when the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, they never let the sound of the times pass them by. Aside from the well-known big hits, casual fans might not be familiar with Van McCoy's disco-era Baby, Don't Change Your Mind. The tune is well-crafted and in a style you don't often hear from Gladys. I just wish they'd omitted Lovin' On Next To Nothing in favor of I Will Fight."

5,Third Novel In Venus Series,"Edgar Rice Burroughs, third book in the series... What you AREN""T going to read it because of a review!?"
4,good for genealogists,"I ordered this book for my husband and son, because it has information on several of their ancestors that came to the US from Ireland. It had the required information."
5,Great but be careful with the size,I bought this shoes knowing that I had to buy them at least one size bigger from my regular climbing shoes. I bought them and even they were one size bigger they were too tight. I would recommend to buy them at least 1 1/2 size bigger. Even thought great climbing shoes!!!!FiveTen Men's Dragon Climbing Shoe
1,So bland,"The jokes aren't funny and the art is poorly drawn scribbling. I may just dislike that art style, but the anatomy, forshortening and depth of pretty much every comic just seems to be way off."
3,It was okay. The art was good.,"This is an okay book. Some of the cartoons are amusing, and the art is good, I think that as an artist they are very similar to the New Yorker or dailies that you see. However, many of the jokes are a bit tedious, and I think some were meant to be funny but missed the mark. It makes a nice coffee table book."
5,Learned SO Much Here!,"This cassette series brought to my living room the opportunity to sit at the feet of some of America's finest Ivy League professors as they lecture on the books that form the corpus of the Western Literary Tradition. Wish I'd done this series years ago. Would have been beating my husband at Jeopardy all this time. Purchasing the new series directly from The Teaching Company would have been more than I could afford but this identical cassette version so cheaply priced compared to the current format, so I just purchaed a cheap cassette player at Amazon Marketplace. (Love marketplace sellers, reliable plus save you a fortune!) The lectures chosen for the ""Great Authors"" series are the best that one can expect from collegiate academia. I'm so happy with my purchase that I'm going to search through other Teaching Series, cassette version, learning while saving by buying on cassette."
3,I wrote one of the stories,"I have to say this.... The stories are true. The woman who wrote the book took a collection of stories over the internet and with the permission from the authors she created this book. Why 3 stars?? Well, my story was edited so much that I was embarrassed to show my friends. I was sent copies to give to family etc. But still have a bag full. I don't believe my story held the whole meaning that I was trying to convey. I am a little peeved about that. I was told the story would go in as is but it didn't, she broke her word to me. Nevermind I had to track her down to find out that my story WAS in the book and and I wanted the copies as she promised. ...."
2,Simplistic and contrived,"These stories had a false ring to me, as if the author made them up. The compilation seems as if it were smacked together overnight. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Jon Meacham of Newsweek Mag. says:,"""This a brilliant, accessible, and Virgilian guide to that most influential of texts: The Book of Common Prayer. Anyone who cares about language, about sacramental life, and about Anglicanism will find Hefling and Shattuck's volume indispensable, for it takes readers to the roots of the faith, shedding new light on old words, bringing our past into vivid focus, and reminding us that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.""---Jon Meacham, Managing Editor of Newsweek and author of ""American Gospel: God, the Founding Fathers, and the Making of a Nation"""
5,Excellent starting point for the restorer,"This book isn't a detailed step by step guide in the specifics of restoring an old T-bird but it does give the new Bird owner a good idea not only of what he or she has, but what it is worth. There is a lot of very good info on the history of the 58-66 T-birds as well as an excellent section on the rare M-Code T-birds of 62-63.Great reading for the T-bird fan or just for any car nut"
2,restoration guide?,"There are some helpful diagrams but the pictures were of very poor quality and with other information available on the internet and from available shop and assembly manuals, save your money and pass this book up."
2,Poor photo quality makes book only a minor help in restoration,"The printing quality is equivalent to a photocopy and is inexcusable for the type of book and the price being charged. Much of the text references illustrations that are so muddy or dark that they can't be seen.The charts and diagrams are clear, but are taken from Ford Service and Parts documents, (as mentioned by other reviewers) so if you already have those, you can pass on this book. Not the author's fault, as there are interesting tidbits related to the various model years, but the publisher should be ashamed for putting out such a poor quality print job.Very disappointing and I would return it, but don't want to deal with the hassle. This is ONLY for those who really want everything related to T-birds."
3,new edition flawed,This book had been out-of-print. The new edition that is now available looks like it was copied from an original on a Xerox copier. This makes many of the photos of little value since they did not reproduce well. The book is still good to have but it would be worth looking for an old edition with good quality photos.
4,Enjoyed pulling my plunger...,"Very cool controller and playable by more people than arcade games. Nearly every twit can play pinball. The scrolling screen may bother some people, and there is no ""full screen"" option. And yes, the nudge factor is cool, but twitchy.The thing with these games is they are basically made for kids and they have mass grownup appeal. But they are not made for grownups. Therefore graphics and features lack a bit. Don't get me wrong, I love the space pinball table. It is played most often.A worth while toy to have when you don't know what kind of game you want to play. The physics seem to be done fairly well. I'd like to see a sequel to this unit with shaper graphics, better sound and hotter tables."
1,Sorry I bought it,"Not only is this book a waste of money but its title is so misleading that borders on the fraudulent. Only about 15% of the book deals with the puported subject (IBS). The only thing you are going to learn from this Handbook is that you should not smoke, take caffeine, drink alcoholic beverages or eat fat and sugar. And then only on general health priciples, not because this regime would be particularly helpful in alleviating the IBS syntoms. What a take!"
1,Junk,What a waste of money. This books gives information that is very basic. The book is more basic then any magazine article on the subject of IBS.
4,How to Make Artist's Brushes,"As a practicing artist, I am always looking for new ways to make expressive and appealing images. I work mainly in porcelain pottery, decorated with slips and glazes.I bought this book to learn how to make brushes, brushes which will enable me to create more distinctive images. My needs are somewhat different from what the book provides, but I found enough information to assist me in experimentation with making tools for expression.The book is more geared toward industrial manufacture, but there is more than enough information and example for the individual to make implements of good quality and function. The difficulty lies in gathering materials and finding a place to work where the cat will not try to supervise...I recommend this book for all artists who like to make their own tools."
5,good stuff,"if you took vegetable oil and took a lick and add a little lemon, that is what this stuff tastes like. it's clean and it's not offensive. plus, it's about a 1,000 mg of Omega3 fatty acids per 1 teaspoon serving. this bottle contains 47 servings."
5,Mcgruder is the Chris Rock of comics...,Public Enemy #2 puts real issues into real comedy! The book is politically witty and joyfully sarcastic. Mcgruder is the Chris Rock of comics!
5,I love the Boondocks!,"The man below me seems to find it some how helpful to be condescending towards any sort of thing that defiles the ""white supremacy"" I have absolutely nothing against white people in any shape or form, but this man speaks complete ignorance. The only thing that differs from people is their culture, not their skin, eye color, hair color, or anything else. To be negligent towards other cultures is pure idiocy. People constantly fear what they don't understand and this does nothing but allow ignorance to reign. The Boondocks is a comic and just as simply it is comical. It's a funny little pass time, I don't see anyone deciphering any Garfield comics. So to get back to what this commentary is really about, Boondocks is a great comic with some interesting insights. Peace, stay golden!"
4,Simply Enjoyable,"I was very interested in this book, due to the comic strip, and I must say I was not disappointed. Shows a different perspective on social and political views with a great comical twist."
5,Hilarious!,I loved this book! McGruder does a great job of pulling the ridiculous out of everyday situations and making fun of it!
1,Printed out of order,"Stupid punks couldn't even print the strips in calendar order.One moment you're reading a strip about Bush winning the election, next page Kerry is preparing for the debates.Stupid, stupid, stupid punks. (Mad props to McGruder for scribbling in the dates in each strip. Pity the book was ruined)"
2,This cartoon is getting too hip-hop and too political,"Sure, being political and hip-hop has always been the standard of The Boondocks, but when it gets so extremely focused on the outside world of black celebrities and politicians it just gets boring.There's very few times when the reader actually gets to know the characters' personalities becuase they're always talking about black actors, rappers, or the Bush administration. There are hardly ever any moments with plots involving the characters themselves in personal situations, so when do we really get to know them?I'm a liberal who has some pretty good knowledge of hip-hop culture, but I still find that The Boondocks has just become very one sided by showing things from the single point of perspective of a left-wing African American."
1,What a piece of GARBAGE,"This comic is so stupid. When you boil it down, it's NOTHING but "" White people do this, and black people do THIS"" jokes with ""Bush is stupid!"" thrown into the mix. This is like an officially licensed webcomic. Not worth the money, or time to read it. And despite it's OCCAISIONAL message against racism, the jokes are usually racist. People who will enjoy this book are those who are too lazy to read a real book"
5,rhinestone belt,"the buckle is even more beautiful in person, it went with my outfit perfect and arrived at my door step quick."
3,"Worth it just for Fred Blassie classic ""Pencil Neck Geek""","The songs are funny, the artists a little warped and the compiler himself, Dr. Demento definately twisted. There is good and average in this collection, but its all worth it for the Classy Freddie Blassie classic ""Pencil Neck Geek."" Blassie, a former WWF wrestler (in the good old days) recorded this beauty in his own inimitable fashion. Weird Al's selections are typically strong and Julie Brown's ""The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun"" is fabulous. Guaranteed to make you laugh,if you've got a pulse!"
4,Less than 5 cents per guffaw!,"Twenty-five years ago, my mother would poke her head into my room late at night and order me to stop laughing, every Sunday. Fast forward to present, my girlfriend pokes her head into the living room asking when I'm coming to bed, and what am I laughing at! I thought I listened to every show, but I never heard ""Guitarzan"" before getting this album. What a hilarious spoof of Sgt. Pepper! Hearing this wide variety of talented musicians with twisted minds sure makes me wish I could play! Looking at the playlists, this looks like the best Dr. D compilation out there. If you are a fan, don't forget the Tom Lehrer box set."
5,who wouldn't like Dr. D.,"As usual, Amazon came through with a hard to find CD. We got it quick, and in perfect condition. I had this on cassette, and needed to replace it with the CD version. There are just two songs on this collection that I can't stand, but over all, it's really fun to listen to."
4,Why Does Music Have To Be So Seroius?,"This album is just plain fun. It's great to have a nice collection of novelty songs to sprinkle in during a party or when making compilation discs for long drives or just and evening of fun with some friends.Dr. Demento's collection surely won't be one of those precious ""desert island"" albums, those must have albums one would never be caught without, but in the context of a complete collection, it's good to have a few laughs here and there.You'd really have to be a baby-boomer to appreciate the full context of this album as many are from the before the 1970's, still have some fun, why not?"
3,"A few classics, a lot of junk","The CD is worth it for the classics, like ""They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha Ha"" which I couldn't find on itunes, but most of the songs are pretty bad."
4,Lots of Material. A great comedy primer.,"Sad to say that there are more naughty songs on here than I would care to have. It makes it a hard cd to just give to my kids to listen to. However, there are some some great things on here that are worth skipping a few tracks. Boot to the Head, Star Trekkin and Gitarzan (a happy surprise) are all favorites."
4,DrDemento-Radio's Wild & CrazyGuy,"This anthology includes many of the songs that have become synonomous with the good Doctor(ie:""They're Coming To Take Me Away,Ha-Ha!"",""Fish Heads"",""Pencil Neck Geek"",& ""Dead Puppies"").Obviously,Dr.Demento is an acquired taste,but I'll take him over Howard Stern anyday.You should definitely add this one to your comedy collection."
3,flasback,"It was strange to hear some of the songs again,and remember the words. There are several songs on here that I don't remember ever hearing but in general it is a great CD"
2,BORING,"Halpern is a master, but this album was boring. Verrrrryyyyyy Boooooorrrrinnnggg. Many better choices of Halpern's works to choose from to settle for this one."
1,Get what you pay for,"I got this set and had to modify the case to keep the bits from moving freely inside it. I have tried to use the half inch on steel and the mild steel was harder than it. I also bought a bit sharpener, I have a need for it now. I plan to try to harden them but I'm not sure I am going keep them."
1,Garbage,Do not buy these are Chinese junk I used them once had to throw them away I cant believe they can get away with selling them as drill bits.
1,Complete Junk!!!,"I didn't buy this drill bit set from Amazon but from another seller. I am however, a frequent Amazon shopper and wanted to warn anyone contemplating buying this chinese crap. The 5/8"" bit would not drill a piece of 1/8"" mild steel. Consider yourself warned...."
5,Same part you'd get from the dealer,"This was for an 04 Explorer XLT. I purchased this part when replacing the leaking lower thermostat house (RH148). While the current part was okay, I figured while I was working on to just replace it all. This part is identical to the one it replaced and has worked well for me."
5,Superb,"With angela Lansbury's cooperation, the author was able to construct the life of the star and her dreams without being intrusive into episodes of her life. He truly respected the subject and the star rewarded him with candor. it is too often that authors choose biographies to sensationalize a life. In this case, the author told it straight but with humanity and dignity and affection for a woman of icnredible talent and character."
3,A very enjoyable read,"For those who've admired Angela Lansbury's screen and stage performances, this authorized bio should be a real treat. I found the chapters on MGM and her musical stage career particularly entertaining. I did feel that I might have been missing part of the story because of the authorization, but I found myself zipping through the pages, which is always a good sign. I didn't agree with negative evaluation of the musical film The Harvey Girls but that's a minor quibble. I also liked Gottfried's book on Sondheim, and I appreciate he chooses such worthy subjects."
5,A GREAT BIOGRAPHY,"If you are an Angela Lansbury fan like I am, you will love this book. It tells of her family, her marriage, children, her days at MGM, her talks and encounters with movie stars, her movie career, Murder She Wrote and after. It is a well-written book not trashy like the Kitty Kelly biographies or sugar coated. I enjoyed reading this book. A GREAT READ."
4,"Self-Serving, But a Great Read Nonetheless","There are two mainstream biographies of Angela Lansbury floating about on the marketplace, and of the two this is clearly the best one. Standing in stark contrast to ""Angela Lansbury: A Life On Stage and Screen,"" this account of the legendary actress's life and career features extensive quoting, administered specificially for the author and this book, and glosses over more shameful episodes (which we all have some form of) such as her childrens' drug problems in the late 60s. Few insights into Lansbury's personal life and intrinsic motivations are revealed, but since the author is clearly a frend of hers that is one thing to be expected, and, unfortunately, the whole idea of writing a proper biography with genuine insight into the person biographized cannot hinge on such liberal quoting and a prior friendship between author and subject."
2,Bland and disappointing,"I am a Lansbury fan, and was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. It ignored any controversy in Lansbury's life. Too often, it read like a glorified press release. Very disappointing"
3,Very Detailed,This is an extremely detailed look at Angela Lansbury and with much grace given. It is amazing to hear this woman was nearly perfect. I suggest to buy this book if you are doing a research paper of some kind. It is seriously that thorough.
3,OK biography of a great performer,"I generally enjoyed this book. It is neither the best nor worst biography I have ever read. Like too many authorized books, it occasionally lacked bite and controversy. Nonetheless, I learned much that I already did not know about Lansbury.One more point: Why do most of the positive notices for this book on amazon.com sound less like real opinions and more like publicity blurbs written by the author's best friend?"
1,Mind-bogglingly bland,"One wonders how an astute critic like Gottfried could succumb to this sort of obsequious, pandering star biography work. Clearly it's all dictated by Lansbury, and Gottfried has no intention of doing any original thinking or research. This couldn't be more vacant."
2,POOR BUSINESS PRACTICE,"The product I received a ""Digital Imaging"" Media Recovery CD was a product that was supposed to be sold ""with"" a qualifying Video Camcorder or Camera Purchase. It was not supposed to be sold individually as specified on the packaging. The product was also a DEMO CD it was not a full version as I was lead to believe by the Distributor who refused to answer my concerns. Very disappointed the way the distributor handled the whole situation. Amazon, I am sure had no idea of what was going on."
4,good product. does what it says,"This product does seem to add a little extra spring to my step. Some users said they were too small, but I wear a large short size and a large in this fit fine. Maybe they didn't realize that these are compression fit clothing."
3,"Reasonably fun while it lasted, which wasn't long...","Judging from my own experience and the posted reviews, this isn't the most durable game. Ours broke after about 20 hours of use. The games are fun (though I couldn't figure out the golf, and Aladdin is too hard for 5-year-olds, and most adults), even if the graphics are of 1980s quality. Perhaps the quality problem stems from the all-in-one design (the joystick and console are one unit). It would be a nice design...if it lasted longer."
3,video game,"Obtained this for my 4 y.o. daughter, graphics are 1980's, but this does not bother her, she took to it very easily, entertains her for hours, easy hook up, great game for kids, can be hooked up to portable dvd plyer while travelling."
5,Disney TV Games is a Lot of FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am glad that my mom bought me Disney TV games. SHe bought it for my birthday because I liked the Spongebob one so much ! But this one is WAYYYY cooler and a ton of fun. My mom and dad and sister even play . We might have to get 2 ! There are 5 Games on here, Donald's Golf, Aladdin, Simba, Timon and Puumba and Lilo and Stitch - I couldn't believe it !I hope that they make a Harry Potter and a PowerRangers TV games too. =)"
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!,Bought this shredder in Nov 2005 and it completely broke about 5 months later. Sent it back to the manufacturer and its been 2 months and I still have not recieved a replacement.
4,Headphones,"These headphones are tight, they have so much bass that even if you put the volume all the way up, they dont run out of bass. The only problem with these headphones is that theyre kind of cheaply made. I've had them for about a year and the ear cup popped out of the socket thing. Its not a big problem, just have to tape them up but they do have pretty good durability cause they have been slammed around a little bit."
1,Watch out!!!,Wrong headphones. Twice I have ordered these headphones and twice they have sent out the wrong ones!!! I keep recieving foldable bass vibration headphones which are cheaply made and sound horrible! The don't even look similar. Only thing they have in common is there made by the same company.Acording to amazon they simply just don't have the correct ones in stock. So if you feel like having to deal with amazon customer service and sending your package back go for it.
2,Performance is fine. Construction is flimsy!,"The unit performs as described, but the headphone frame is complex in construction and flimsy. It broke spontaneously after only a few weeks of conscientious care, rendering the unit useless. The vendor, Beach Audio, does not accept claims for defective products after 30 days."
3,Devilishly Baffling,"Lawrence Babits' tale of the Battle of Cowpens gives an extraordinarily detailed account of individual officers and soldiers by name, unit and wounds received. Perhaps my expectations were different, but I found this book a somewhat baffling recitation of minutia related to the Americans who participated in this battle. There are many maps which help clarify unit positions and movements. The best part of the book is the detailed explanation of company and regimatal units and why each unit responded the way it did.It became exceedingly clear from the narrative that William Washington's (second cousin to George) cavalry turned the tide in favor of Daniel Morgan and the American rebels. Read this book if you are interested in the minute detail related to this battle. But if you are looking for a broader perspective of how Cowpens dovetails with the rest of the Revolutionary War in the Carolinas there are many, far better books to satisfy your goal."
5,Battle of Cowpens,"Excellant History of one of the decisive, but perhaps lesser known battle of the Revolution"
4,A devil of a good read,"Babits certainly put in the time to do the research for this book. As anyone knows who has done research involving combat actions, memories, even very shortly after a battle can become blurred. Babits I think does a good job sifting through some of the bogus recollections that comes from this ""fog"" of battle. The battle reconstruction, unit movements, and analysis of casulties is the best I have read regarding this action. Anyone reading this book should do so carefully. Footnotes should be consulted and time should be spent with the variety of charts and maps. The book is a little slow, but then most books of this nature are read by people looking for knowledge and not a good time."
1,Oh dear...,"The one battle where the Americans managed to win properly against an out-numbered British force of regulars. Tarleton was a fantastic soldier and cavalry officer but he certainly was not a General. Had Cornwallis or Clinton been there the battle would have been different. It's amazing how a book has been written on this ONE battle. Perhaps an American author might like to write seperate books on the The Battle of Savannah? Maybe Germantown? Or even *shock* Camden? All decisive British victories with massive American casualties.It's interesting to note that Daniel Morgan told his troops that they must on no account cross bayonets with British redcoats at Cowpens. Only goes to prove the melee superiority of British soldiers over US soldiers.Tarleton has his revenge not long after this battle though at Torrance's Tavern where he taunted his dragoons to remember Cowpens. 300 Continental Dragoons, Infantry and Militia were massacred in the ensuing Melee."
4,Insane powerviolence chaos,"Holy Crap!!! This is an unbelievable cd, very fast, very catchy. This is definately a must get for fans of The Locust, Pig Destroyer, or any other thrashy grindy chaotic mess of noise."
5,"Jim may be Prime Minister, but Humphrey is King...","One of the best political satires ever written. This is Book Two regarding the political career of Jim Hacker. Have you every wondered why political schemes never seem to have any practical value? You simply must read this book and find out why that is. Some of the outstanding short stories have been mentioned by other reviewers here, but the Athiest Bishop simply cannot be recommended enough. However, the diplomatic incident over the puppy is probably my favorite. I also loved how a chain smoker becomes Minister of Health. Also, pay attention to Bernard's character thoughout the stories, as one can never be sure what side he'll be on from beginning to end. Cheers to the authors! It doesn't get any better than this!If you enjoyed the ""Yes Minister"" and ""Yes Prime Minister"" books, be sure to read John Mortimer's ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" series."
2,"good for portable CD playes, rotten for PC's","They worked great on my Riovolt CD player, but when i first used them on my laptop with Redhat 9, it was OK, so-so, but when i put them on my compaq presario 5000 running XP home, they sound rotten. i got mine on sale so it was OK, but hey, i also got my CD player for 5 so as long as they work with that, im happy."
1,Horrible,"These speakers were good in the beggining as they got alittle more use.. they started to desort, and 2 of them are blowen i have had them for 2 months only.. and this store wont take them back or replace them and the company GE.. all the confidence in there products wont take them back either..dont buy them.."
3,Not made for everyday use,"I use it everyday for my backups when I am visiting my customers. After less than 6 months of use it started to lose communications with the usb port from time to time. This is I connect it and all of a sudden it disconnects. Another thing is when I click the drive letter in ""My Computer"" it gives me an error message saying that I don't have permission to see my files in it! But one thing is for sure is very fast. The transfer speed is very good."
5,Solid Collection of Little Mack's Early Work,"Little Mack Simmons is a criminally ignored blues vocalist and harmonica player that has been around since the 70's and certainly deserves a wider audience.Little Mack has a soulful, rough edged tenor voice and his arragements of both the blues classics and his own original songs bear his own distinctive stamp.He's a versatile performer who is at home doing country blues, urban blues, jazz and even a few R&B; songs. This collection of his earliest recordings in the Seventies and Eightes, on Electro-Fi is an essential recording for any hard-core blues fan.STRONGEST CUTS ON CD: Leaving in the Morning, My Babe & Mystrey Train.TIP: Check out Little Mack's soulful intrepetation of the jazz classic St. James Infirmary on his 1998 release, ""Little Mack Is Back"""
4,BEST DRAMA SHOW EVER IN AMERICA.....,"DYNASTY WAS MY FAVORITE DRAM SHOW IN TELEVISION WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND I WAS SUCH A FAN, AND HAVING THE SERIES AVAILABLE 24/7 IS SUCH A PLEASURE, THANKS. Luis Q."
5,Dynasty - Season 2,FANTASTIC - great picture quality and sound . Very attractive women in the show also particularly Heather Locklear.John Forsythe as Blake Carrington is fantastic.
3,It's Dynasty,"Okay, the plots are predictable, the acting over the top, the hair and clothes so 1980s, but it's Dynasty."
5,EXCELENTE,SIN DUDA ALGUNA FUE UNA DE LAS MEJORES SERIES DE LA EPOCA LA SEGUNDA PARTE DE LA SERIE DINASTIA TE HACE VIVIR LOS MEJORES MOMENTOS DE UNA EPOCA QUE HOY EN EL AÑO 2007 UNO SE PREGUNTA ESO ERA LO MAS FASHION DE LA EPOCA PARA LOS COLECCIONISTAS DE PELEICULAS ES RECOMENDADAMUY BUENA PRESENTACION Y TIENE ESPAÑOL
2,"Great season, Bad dvd release",This season deserves 5 stars but i am disappointed in the dvd packaging. All of the discs in a tiny case and NO extras at all. Season 1 had great extras so what happened here? They definitely should and could have gotten commentaries and other extras. A bare bones set.
5,Finally The Wait Is Over!!,Dynasty certainly took off with the start of season 2 and I am very happy that it is finally about to be released! No drama on television has lived up to the high bar set by the Carringtons!
4,Dynasty and Another World connection,"I just read an article about how the Shapiro's (Dynasty creators) were good friends with Harding Lemay (Another World writer from 1976-1980). The name Carrington was ""borrowed"" from Iris Carrington from AW and the Krystal, Blake, Fallon triangle was mirrored after Rachel, Mac and Iris. Some of the scenes in Season One of Dynasty were so familiar with scenes on the Classic daytime soap Another World. Claudia having to reveal that she had an affair with Steven on the witness stand was very similar to Mac discovering he wasn't the father of Rachel's baby on AW. Great soap writing on both shows."
2,"Sex, Drugs and Flunking Out","I purchased this book as the parent of a college sophomore. He is flunking out. I purchased this book looking for answers, Instead, I received a book full of questions. It reads as if the author is on a search for the same answers. It offered no real solutions or advice. I did however purchase College of the Overwhelmed and found it to have the answers that the author of this book is seeking. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK."
3,OK at the Best,"I have used this system for little over an year now. Got this as a Gift :)The Good:Easy installtion -- 9/10 Works almost right out of box. Wireless speakers easy to install.Sound Quality -- 7/10 Good enough for apartments or not very large rooms. To enjoy true home theater effect, rear speakers need to placed as recommended in the mannual.compatibility -- 9/10 I tried playing dvds/ recorded dvd/ movie cds/ picture cds etc. No compatibility issues.Ipod Dock: Works Nicely. You can easily control ipod songs with remote.The BAD:Cooling Fan of the dvd player started making loud noise after 8 months if kept switched ON for about 3-4 hours.No hdmi cables providedUpconversion -- 5/10 less than OK. I have played same standard DVD on different upconverters. Panasonic stands somewhere in between.Style/looks: 6.5/10"
2,unsatisfied customer,"The wireless rear speakers are not wireless. If your room is over 20 feet wide, there is no way you can have the speakers on each side of the room. Even if you did, the wires connecting the two speakers to the remote box would still have to be hidden. Wireless rear speakers is an oxymoron. You have rear speakers connected to a remote box by wires."
2,Save your money and buy a better system.,"The system is okay. But for $350, you can buy a lot nicer system. For example, this one comes with a non-powered sub. Which, if you don't care about sound, its fine. But when you watch movies or listen to music, you really need a powered sub. The speakers are also not very good quality.The real selling point are the wireless speakers. Though if you really can't rout wires through your house, then buy a seperate transmitter.I can't recommend this to anyone. I bought an Okoyo 700, and it sounds a TON better. Good luck."
3,Good Home Theater System...but not flexible,"If you are simply looking for an all in one home theater system, this one will suit you well. The (semi) wireless rear speakers were a nice touch and worked better than I expected. I purchased this system but ended up returning it due to the fact that I needed a home theater system with enough flexibility to accept digital surround sound from my HDTV cable box. This one does not. It only has room for one additional auxiliary component, and that is through a basic RCA connection. I'm not sure why they would make a great system with so few inputs! This unit will not serve the function as a good tuner but will make a great upconvert dvd player."
4,"It's good, but it ain't the Original","Something is lost in this translation; one is advise to find the out-of-print 1974 London Phase 4 recording, THE MYSTERIOUS FILM WORLD OF B.H. as conducted by Maetsro, himself. It includes F451 in all it icy beauty as it was heard in the underrated film of 1966. It also includes 7TH VOYAGE and DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, and the fidelity is SUPERB.But as rerecordings go, yes, this is a good one."
5,Love it!,"I loved this toy. I really likes that it is soft so it can be stored easily and pop back into its original shape. My only complaint is that the shapes can be fit through the other holes, but still a great toy."
1,Cute but overall useless,"I received this toy as a baby shower gift and my son is now 13 months. We introduced the toy at 6 months.Pros:- He likes the shapes. They each make a different sound and are different colors.Cons:- Each of the shapes can fit easily into any of the holes, defeating the purpose of being a shape sorter all together.- When you drop the circle ball into the circle hole it falls out of the square hole on the opposite side.- It is bulky and not something you can just throw into a diaper bag. I wouldn't mind this if the toy was useful, but it isn't.Overall this is an overpriced sack that you can stuff different shaped soft balls into. If you are looking for a proper shape sorter you would be better served by theToysmith Battat Sound Puzzle Box. If you are looking for a soft toy that your young infant will enjoy and possibly learn from, try theLamaze High-Contrast Discovery Shapes Activity Puzzle & Crib Gallery. I'm sorry I got this."
2,Could be better,"I purchased this toy to help my 14-month old learn her colors and shapes, but this toy doesn't really do this. First off, because the shapes are made out of soft material, nothing is quite right - the circle isn't really round, the square has rounded edges, etc.More than that, though, this doesn't work at all as a sorting toy as the hole for the square is large enough that all the shapes fit through it. What good is a sorting toy that doesn't require the child to sort? And this is ignoring the top that is velcro'ed closed - it took my DD less than 5 minutes of playing with this toy to find that, and she only needed it as she wasn't convinced that she'd gotten all the toys out by reaching her hand into the hole for the square (she had).I gave this 2 stars as it is colorful and despite the fact that it's not teaching her anything, my DD seems to enjoy it."
3,Daughter was not interested in this toy.,"I thought she would love this, not so much. She touched it a couple times and was just not interested. She has had it from 6-9 mos. and still nothing. O'well, can't win them all."
1,Should have bought a plastic version,"The problem with this product is that a baby can just stuff the shapes into the wrong slots as they are soft. It does not hold them back the way a plastic version would, so how are they supposed to learn their shapes? Also, the lid on the top is very prominent, so my son either puts the shapes in through that way, or just stuffs them through the wrong hole. Plus, the shapes are big so that they fill up the inside quickly, making it hard to fit them in all together (even when going through the correct hole). At first I thought that when he got older he would use it properly, but now my son is 15 months and I just don't see that happening. The fabric is nicely sewed and vibrant, however. It was nice to roll the shapes and shake them when he was younger, but now it is useless to me and I will have to buy a plastic one. Wish I knew this before, now it is another toy lying around."
3,Not as fun as I thought,"We got this for our first child three years ago. She never really played with it--at least not as a shape sorter. We used to look at the shapes and talk about the ball, triangle, square and the colors. It basically sat around collecting dust. We saved it because we wanted more children. Our second child does not play with it as a shape sorter either. We have played with it in a similar fashion, but this time we put other small toys inside which she likes to put in and take out. I love the Lamaze brand of toys. We have the Lamaze PeekaBoo Clutch Cube, Lamaze Pupsqueak, and a mirror which both girls loved. I highly recommend this brand, just not this sorter. There are better shape sorters out there."
1,Known gear jam problem,"There is a well known hardware failure problem with these printers called the ""carriage jam"" issue. The print cartridge carrier gets stuck to the right due to what HP calls a defective gear assembly. HP has been replacing these units outside the standard warranty, though not recalling them.Our company has a few hundred of these and the number of units failing at 13 months is astounding. If you own one and are having this problem you may be able to get HP to replace it outside the warranty period."
4,Great quality and functionality at an affordable price,"The HP 5110 is a terrific all-in-one, far superior to the HP 710 that it replaced. Its printing quality is outstanding; it prints digital photos with superb clarity and no graininess. It has built-in options for each of its functions. One major drawback is that it cannot print addresses on envelopes other than #10 (standard business size). Its weird noises are not a problem but I don't understand why replacement ink cartridges are so costly."
1,Carriage Jam Hell,"Do a web search for carriage jam + HP 5110 and you will find hundreds of annoyed users whose printers have died after a year or so. It's a real shame, because this machine worked well when it worked. It is noisy, it did jam and the software was a bit clunky, but overall it was okay for its price.I don't want to contribute to land fill by junking this thing, but HP refuses to help so what else is there to do? I'm ashamed to throw away something like this and I'm stuck with four unused cartidges which means if I don't buy another compatible HP I will have wasted hundreds of dollars in unused ink.What a shame."
1,HP OfficeJet 5110 failed around 6 months of light use.,"I used this HP OfficeJet 5110xi all-in-one very lightly for around 6 months and it failed and discontinue to function. Most of what I did was just making copies, probaby around 20 to 30 copies during the 6 months period, I only turned on when I use it and turned off afterward. The problem is that,one nice day when I turned it on to make a copy, the digital panel displayed the message ""Open door, carriage jam"", from then on, this Hp OfficeJet unit is no longer usable. What a waste of money $200 for less 6 months of use. I bought laserjet IIIp in 92 and it is still working fine. Now, I no longer believe HP printer products are as reliable as its past products, and the quality seems no longer important characteristics of their products."
1,More Jam ups than the California freeways!,I HATE this piece of garbage! I have an HP scanner that I love. I needed a copier and fax so I thought that this would be a good choice. It wasn't the cheapest unit nor was it the most expensive. Fast modem and higher resolution at a reasonable price. WRONG! This sucker jams almost EVERY time I try to copy or fax multible pages. I contacted HP support and they had no idea why this would happen. (I think the page guides should be deeper IMHO). STAY AWAY...GO WITH CANNON!
1,Unreliable junk,"It used to be that HP made great hardware but offered lousy Mac drivers. As of this model, not even the hardware is good anymore.Even before it died hard with the notorious Carriage Jam failure, it would frequently and randomly stop jobs without warning. Getting it to work again required not only a power-cycle and reconnet, but often a complete software reinstallation.Never could get it to work reliably as a shared or network printer using HP's own drivers, but finally found a Gutenprint 5 solution that worked for about two months before the hardware itself died.I was the last person in my family to have a good feeling about HP printers, and that includes my brother-in-law who works for HP. Now, none of us will ever buy an HP printer again."
1,HP Printer 5110xi All in One - TERRIBLE MACHINE!,"I purchased this machine 2 years ago. I used it sparingly for home print jobs, about 5 pieces a paper a week (give or take) for about 6 months. Then I packed it away for about a year. I took her out a few months ago, and have nothing but Paper jams, loud painful noises and error messages. I went to the HP website and walked myself through some of the fixes ; however after about a total 200 pieces of paper that have been successfully printed on, I have the ""CARRIAGE JAM"" error that everyone is complaining about. The printer/copier/scanner is completely USELESS! This machine costs over 200.00 and if I calculate it correctly only worked for a total of about 7 months straight. I would NEVER recommend another HP printer after the problems I've dealt with. The repairs would cost more then if I just purchased myself a spiffy new Canon."
1,Absolute Junk!,"I got this because they supported OS-X early on. Of course the software was crap, didn't and still doesn't properly support hot-plugging the printer (a reboot is almost always required to print after plugging the laptop in). We didn't use the printer often, and after awhile it decided that the cartridges were too old, and needed replacing, even though they were still 80% full! Replacing the cartridges it printed about 10 more pages and now it appears to have broken a gear and is useless for printing or receiving faxes.I'll never buy another HP product."
5,Great book for stats!,"I recently had to put together a business plan to target the gay and lesbian market here in south Florida. This book provided very valuable insight, and gave me some solid statistical information to bolster my plan.I hope they do the book again after the 2010 census!"
2,Really not worth it,"If you're looking at this because of the software, I'd suggest that you check out the phone manufacturers web site first; they may provide it for free. If you're looking at this for the cable, go for either a retractable on, or get bluetooth for your computer."
1,poor sound quality,"the sound quality was bad. with new technology nowadays in sound restoration, it should have been done a lot better job than that.But considering a very limited interest in this CD and for an unrecognized distributing company, I can see why they didn't want to spend money on improving it..."
5,A Fabulous Singer,What a wonderful singing voice Harry Secombe had.Of course he was from Wales and the Welsh are the finest singers in the whole wide world. I am not from Wales but I adore their singing and this is a great CD to have.so glad Harry did a lot for recordings
5,Incredible!,"A touching, humerous book that relates to everyday life. Easy to read, with individual stories for those who are busy, but hard to put down!"
1,Completely Confusing,I read the author's Korea Strait book and decided to try another. This one is a train wreck. The story skips from post 9/11 terrorism issues to the hero traveling to Bill Clinton's Sarajevo. There is no explanation for the time travel the action just shifts. I liked Korea Strait became the author is career navy and knew how naval exercises work which gave the book a real feel. In this one the hero is working at the White House in a Seven Days in May type scenario. It was dull and didn't really show the attention to detail Korea had done. I finished but it was a long slog.Korea Strait: A Novel (Dan Lenson Novels)
4,well done,Poyer handles his characters growth well. Much action is off screen. As it would be given the character's position. The author's insights are always interesting and sometimes enlightening.
4,Good introduction to Christology,"Fr. O'Collins has written a helpfull introduction to Christology for both the beginning theology student and the inquisitive Christian who is interested in delving into Christian belief from a variety of perspectives- Biblical, Catechetical, Historical, etc. The book is well written and full of quotes and references. O'Collins is able to inform people and inspire a deeper understanding of Christian theology. This book is easy to reccomend to someone who is seriously interested in Christology."
4,Handy and cheap,"I have a few splash cymbals, and I didnt want to buy a full stand for them. I still needed to mount them some how, so i bought this product. It is just the right hight, and hold the cymbals sucure, but loosens up on me, and i have to tightn it every once in a while so it wont rattle (im sure a little lock tight would fix that though)."
5,6 Inch Stacker,"Yeah, this thing works good! The only problem is my drum stand is in metric:/ so I have to buy a new cymbal stand (which I was going to do anyways) to set this on it, for my china!"
5,For you listening pleasure,"LOVE this CD! Delivery was very quick, product was in excellent condition. I listen to this CD over and over. Can't seem to get enough. Will be buying Alligator Stomp 1, 3 and others soon."
5,Another Gem from the Vaults at Rhino,"I get the feeling that my dream job would be to work at Rhino Records. ALLIGATOR STOMP VOL. II is yet another of the great compilations and anthologies put together by the Rhino folks. They have assembled a great cross-section of Cajun classics. I can't say that it is definitive, but it's sure a great time. Play this at your next BBQ or party and I can guarantee smiles on everyone's faces and questions about the artists that are recorded here."
5,Pick Up and Read,"Leon Metz is a very knowledgeable historian with an accessible writing style. This book is perfect for the ""light"" reader. You can pick it up for fifteen minutes, read an interesting biographical sketch that is written in a witty easy style and leave it on a coffee table or in the bathroom on the tank ready for your next visit. I do really appreciate the chapters on the more obscure gunmen and his ""debunking"" of the romantic gunfighter stereotype. I will have to look around downtown El Paso with more of a historical looking glass on my next visit. In summation, an excellent read that holds a place of honor next to O'Neal's ""Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters"" on my bookshelf."
3,"Outdated, but a godd start","Considering that:a) Almost every character profiled in this book has one (or dozens) of books written about;b) A lot of theses characters have longer sketches in Wikipedia.one can assume this book is highly outdated, have being written in 1976.However, if you wann find a brief introduction to the most famous gunmen in Old West, this is indeed a fine place to start. The brief sketches are fairly accurate and the humour tha author sometimes uses is very good."
5,Shooters,I have yet to finish this book but have enjoyed it so far. Anyone who is a fan of the gunlinger will enjoy reading this.
4,Varied and thorough,"The Shooters is a pretty darn good book that covers alot of Old West figures. Half of them are pretty well known (James, Billy, Hickok, Buffalo Bill, Hardin, Earps, Holliday) and then there are many of the lesser known to the general population. There's lots of history here and some well done research. This book covers quite a bit of the history of the 'Shooters' or gunmen of the West giving us brief life histories of them. Recommended for Old West buffs and to the history buffs. Not a bad book for passing interest either."
3,"Light reading by an historian with good knowledge of the true ""Old West""","Leon Claire Metz is an extremely knowledgeable and informed historian of the Old West. He knows many facts and has much inside information based on his research and he knows how to tell a story. These stories in The Shooters, are brief and to the point, but tell some interesting facts and ""surmises"" about western ""Shooters"" in the 1800's and early 1900's, and are a fun read. Those with a pretty sophisticated background in the subject may find it a bit light, and may or may not agree with everything author Metz concludes, but that is what makes it interesting to read, different opinions and conclusions offer a new perspective through which to view these fascinating men, and some women."
5,A truly exallent work,"Having spent the vast majority of my life in the South West and the very city where Mr. Metz live I have had a chance to see first hand the fabrications that a formed about such me as Billy the Kid, John W. Harden, Wyatt Earp, and others. With this in mind it is nice to find a true to life and exqisitly written book about the lives thease men really lead. This book is a literary gold mine for all those interusted in the history of the American West."
4,cheese cloth for wort filter,"I decided I wanted to filter wort after boiling before transferring to the fermentation vessel to keep as much hops and trub out of the brew bucket as possible. I ordered this because of the good reviews and low price.It did a great job filtering - I put it in a sanitized kitchen strainer and poured my chilled wort through it on the way into the bucket. I caught a LOT of material that would have otherwise gone into my beer.The only thing I didn't like is that when I cut a reasonable ""filter"" sized piece off, the ends frayed quite a bit. I gently hand washed the piece I used in the sink and it frayed more - I hope it lasts. However, even if it doesn't, I'll get at least two uses out of each piece, and there is enough in the pack to get probably 6 filter sized pieces."
5,Nice heavy cheesecloth,This is a nice sturdy cheesecloth. Much better quality than the stuff I have been able to get locally either in grocery stores or the fabric shops. I'll order this again when I need it.
4,Facts,Pros:SoftEasy to cut but not tearMulti-purposeNaturalCons:Somewhat expensiveWould buy again though and updating this review is possible
4,It's cheesecloth,"I fold it double to strain yogurt, and it does the job just fine. Would buy again when the pieces I have now are old and tatty. :o)"
5,How much can you say about cheese cloth?,"I have never used another brand so I can't reliably compare, but I can say that this cheese cloth met my expectations and was worth what I paid for it. Will purchase again."
1,"Buyer beware, they'll send you an already been opened item...","I ordered this item expecting it to be ""new"" as defined by Amazon's standards. However, when I received the package, it had clearly been opened. Someone had poked their finger through the plastic to see what the material felt like. If I can't sell an item in this type of condition labeled as ""new"", how can Amazon. And as one of the other reviews said, there are lots of brown dirt looking pieces in the material. Not really something I would want to have in/touching my food."
1,Cheese cloth,"This stuff is junk, the weave is far too large to be useful for anything. Don't buy this stuff, you will be disappointed. And you will be wasting your money."
1,dirty,This cheese cloth has brown/black specs all in it. I don't feel comfortable straining whey through it with all of this dirt all throughout. The specs do flick/pick off but it would take me months to get them all off -- there are thousands all over. I tried hand washing it to no avail. Then I ran it through the washing machine and that had no effect on the specs either :/.
5,Perfect Turkey,I loved this product!!! This was my first time using a cheesecloth for the turkey. I did not have to baste the turkey at all and it came out beautifully!!! I would recommend this cloth to any first time or seasoned individual cooking a turkey.
5,Bigger Than Life!,I love all the songs on this cd...Only complaint is that it is way too short!!!! A Must have for fans!!!!
4,Review thingy,"Okay so this was like a really good book. Well actually it was awesome! Its full of lies, shipwrecks, slavery, action, and sacrifice! It even has a hint of romance between the main character and this native girl who teaches him that everyone doesn't have to have the same religion to get along. AAAWWW! How cute!!!**^-^**!!anyway...this book is really great so read it and be prepared not to be able to put it down. (ahem-watch out the end is kinda gruesome)Yeah, so like read the sequels other wise you'll be left on a cliffhanger! They are The feathered serpent and the amethyst ring! You'll never forget this book!!! (haha maybe you will...)"
2,Mine is defective,"My camera has a problem where a lot of times, the picture breaks and disaligns, and I get a garbled picture. Does anyone have an idea of what to do???"
5,Terrific program,I purchased this for my 16 month old grandson as his first software. It was all that I expected and more. A terrific introduction to the computer and an excellent learning tool.
5,Reader Rabbit is the BEST Toddler program out there!,"I have three children 6 and under. I used RR Toddler with the first and second and then lost it. I had several other toddler programs and tried all of them, but they just aren't nearly as good as RR! So...I bought another copy and my 2 year old LOVES it! In fact, my 4 year old wanted to play it again, too! It is just the best! RR Preschool is also out of this world!By the way, my second child has apraxia and couldn't talk AT ALL until the age of 4. RR Toddler really gave him an opportunity to shine and to show just how smart he really is! It gave him a great boost of confidence which I believe led to how well he is now doing with his apraxia."
3,Must change color settings to 256,Kind of a pain that you have to change the color settings to 256 before you use the program./
4,Gradually my son showed improvements,"My son son is 15 months old. Initially he didn't like this very much, but gradually he started liking different games. Instead of punding the keyboard, now he started to type. He has also started to use mouse in the color book. There is no problem with using this in windows xp. (the cd which I received tells that ""now works with windows xp""), so make sure to get that version. Even though he playes different games, he plays for a short time and then he gets distracted, he stops playing. I am not sure whether this is due to his behaviour or because of the product. As an adult, I can say the games in the CD were designed correctly, but somehow my son doesn't gets fully involved for a long time, so I am giving 4 stars otherwise 5 stars."
1,A wonderful program...if it would actutally work,"The games are wonderful. My son loved them all and it kept his attention (which is not easy). After he had played it a few times, it began freezing up or the picture would only be partially displayed and he'd get very frustrated. I tried totally rebuilding the computer in the event it was a problem with the computer rather than the game but the same problem happened over and over. He also plays the ""JumpStart"" games on the same computer and we never have any problems with those games. They are just as good or better than Reader Rabbit."
4,My 22-month-old plays it by herself and loves it.,"We have a different version, I think, but the point is the same: it's great. This game taught my daughter how to use the mouse (without clicking) at 21 months of age. At first she cried to play it all the time and that was difficult, but as soon as I realized she could do it by herself it has been fantastic. The fact that it doesn't require mouse clicks is crucial. We limit the amount of time she plays it each day so she doesn't become a computer junkie, but at least it is educational.(Tip: set your screen resolution to 800x600 or 640x480 and turn your mouse speed way down using the control panel. The slower the mouse, the less control they need.)"
1,couldn't use it,it is so old that you can only use it with windows 97 any thing newer than that it will not work on
5,"6 mo later, she still loves it !! five stars","Love it! At first I thought it was lame, the singing rabbit looked goofy, but she loves it and plays it all the time! There are dif. levels -- toddler and baby -- and she likes them both. Letter games, matching games, number games, signing games, it's educational and fun. It's easy for her to turn on and withing a week, she learned how to turn it off.She was 2/5 when we got it and she is 3 now and playing with it as I type (yes, she has her own computer). LOL"
3,Okay for a toddler to use,"My 2-year-old daughter was pretty excited about this program. unfortunately, it often causes our Windows 98 computer to crash, and she gets frustrated when we have to reboot, and she has to wait.She has not yet gotten the hang of the mouse, so she mostly just watches and listens, while we play it for her. She really likes having her own thing to do on the ""pe-ku-ter""!"
2,Too easy!,"We bought this game for our 2-1/2 yr old last week and found that the games are too simple, the long instructions are annoying and can't be turned off, and you can't operate it without the CD. All the games are very easy, more geared towards 1-1/2 to 2 yr olds. Activities include matching letters, popping bubbles, matching animals. Although they are good for teaching mouse control, they are not intellectually challenging and our daughter is already bored with them."
5,Awesome!,"Just got Miranda Lambert's new Kerosene CD yesterday and it's awesome. The lyrics are strong, her voice is pure, the artist seems to ""feel"" the music, I guess since she wrote most of it. My favorite is ""New Strings,"" but they are all good. I've played it over and over. She has a dynamic voice, whether it's a slow ballad, like ""Greyhound Bound for Nowhere,"" or a driving, bad-attitude song like ""Kerosene."" I even like the Texas shuffle, ""I Can't Be Bothered."" Now that's a tune that gets stuck in your head! I like that the CD sound doesn't seem ""too polished."" It doesn't sound like everybody else. Each song is fresh."
2,Metaphor Dictionary,"Disappointing. Most of these metaphors can be found online or aretried and true, at best. Not applicable to simple prose."
4,A fine piece,"I have not gone into the depth of it much but at a glance it seems apt for its purpose. What I miss is a metaphor or symbol dictionary that accounts for the ways singular words can be lent to metaphor. Like sky, desert, glass, water and so forth and in what metaphorical applications they have been used."
4,Great Sheet!,"I've been very pleased with this sheet and all of the Carter's products I have purchased. It was great in the summer, but I use warmer, stretchy flannel sheets now that it's winter. This sheet has held up perfectly in the wash. My only problem is that it comes out of the dryer quite wrinkled, but that's just me being a perfectionist. The sheet matches so many of Carter's other blankets and nursery accessories that it's a good bargain. Highly recommended!"
2,poor quality,I bought this sheet for my daughter and am very disappointed with the quality of the sheet.After a few washes the material started to pill and it has become very rough.(like sandpaper...well almost).I would not recommend this sheet to anyone.
4,Cute Sheets,"These sheets are so cute. We selected them to go with the Carter's Boy Plaid set, choosing the bugs as an accent to our nursery. They have held up very nicely and remain soft. I continue to wash them in warm water (not hot) with Dreft and they have been wonderful. We also found the matching receiving blankets, mobile, bassinet pad, and other features at babies r us."
4,The John McCain segment,"The Senator from Arizona John McCain comes to talk to Charlie Rose about the candidacy for President of his friend, Bob Dole. Previously McCain had supported Phil Gramm but Gramm's withdrawal from the race put McCain in the Dole camp. McCain speaks positively about Dole's chances about his leaving the Senate and putting all his political future on the Presidential race.McCain is bright and articulate. There is however a certain hint of something cocky and school- teacherish about him. At times it seems he does not speak to Charlie Rose but rather 'explains' to him. Nonetheless he appears knowledgable , clear- headed , and firm in his convictions."
4,Love that it's organic and biodegradable,"These are as comfortable as pads can be and it's great that the packaging as well as the pad itself is biodegradable and contains no plastic or chemicals.The only issue I have is that these don't look as 'super' absorbent as other 'super' pads I've used. I mean that they aren't as thick as other 'super' pads. Although that may not matter if the material itself is really absorbent.So far though, they work pretty well."
1,"Out of Date ""WIRELESS"" description",This product is caled a WIRELESS intercom. Today one would expect that such a device would work by means of radio frequency communication. Well that is not how it actually does work. In the small print you are told that it will only work if each unit is on the same electrical circuit. So it requires the house wiring to communicate between the units. This results in the units only working if they are in the same or posible adjacent rooms. In my house we have an electrical service panel with 36 circuits. This give us one chance out of 36 in being able to contact one unit from another that is randomly / remotely installed in our residence. This item should be withdrawn from sale as it is functionally useless.
1,Not Good For Household use,"I agree and wish I had read the review regarding the use of this product prior to purchasing it. I know of very few homes in my area that run on 1 (ONE) electrical circuit. I have a panel in my basement full of circuits, so this intercom is useless unless I use the two units side by side. Garbage is how I would classify this unit"
1,The complainers are right ..,No need to call a electrician. It's written on the box - will only work with receivers on the same ckt. Bought it and tried it all over the house. It would only work on the same floor with outlets on the same ckt. I could shout to those locations easier than using this.
1,An intercom that Doesn't Work,"This intercom just doesn't work! I have attempted to use it in many rooms on different circuits, and in different situations. The unit is unreliable (you can not be sure that what worked yesterday will work today), and most of the time doesn't work at all. I don't care what the reasons are, the unit doesn't work. My unit is now in the trash. You can not rate it 0 stars, or I would have done that."
5,"Power, Grace, Honesty.","Longineu Parson's music is not for the faint of heart. He will pick you up and force you to listen to what he wants to say, and will pull no punches while saying it. He is also one who can fly with the eagles as opposed to describing how the eagles fly, and, he can carry you along with him on his flights. Finally, he is one who knows where he came from. He acknowledges those who inspired him to go to the places he has been and where he is going. For the serious music lover and especially trumpet lovers, Longineu is one you should not pass over. Get this CD!"
4,Most Good,First off I have got to admit I love the Waifs. They have more talent in one finger then most groups have in their entire body. I see no reason for a studio version of Bridal Train and a live version ?? That being said I still love 90% of these 2 CD's. Thanks Waifs for making my life better through your music. Also the Waifs attempt at a Rap song. The truth of the matter you can't take a group with tremendous talent and lower their standards to a Rap type of a song. It did not work for me. I still love them!
2,Stating the obvious,"This is the first craps strategy book I've read. I'm reading a second now in preparation for an upcoming trip to Vegas.Forever Craps was a disappointment. There's an occasional tip that seems reasonable, but it states the obvious a lot... what a pass line bet is, what ALL the bets are. Unless you've never even stepped up to a craps table and thrown the dice, it goes on for a while with obvious information.I'm not disputing the concept of controlling the dice, but this book doesn't really help you find that control."
1,complete mythology...do not waste your time,i have no idea who's giving this book 4 and 5 stars. i guess if you don't have any understanding of probability theory you might actually believe this crap. picking shooters by independent random events of their rolls? pissed off that i actually spent money on this. controlling dice? yeah right...if so cut the crap with the stories and show us independent verification of the experiment that proves it. its a simple experiment isn't it? yet no where have i seen anyone with any proof of even the slightest statistical edge from their dice control crap.
2,Dice book,"Some good information, but was hard to read and follow, seemed a bit too confusing and had to re-read. Seemed a bit too advanced wouldn't recommend it."
5,It works,"The system works. I find out if I stick to the 5-counts system and wait patient until a hot shooter shows up, it will pay off at the end"
5,Usuable Strategies and Excellent Anecdotes,"I think this is my favorite craps book that I ever read. The author, Frank Scoblete, not only understands the ins and outs of the game of craps like no other writer but he is a great writer as well.The strategies are clearly explained, backed up with math and common sense, and have the ring of experience to them.A definite must for anyone interested in beating the casinos."
5,The Most Sophisticated Craps Book Ever,"Craps used to be considered a game that couldn't be beaten. However, Scoblete shows clearly why that is not so anymore. His five-step advantage-play method is really just that - a serious method for beating the casinos at craps. I recommend this book to anyone who is motivated to beat the game of craps."
5,Scoblete's book is the most advanced ever on craps,"""Forever Craps"" is a book that really explains how to use an intelligent, disciplined approach to craps in order to get a real world edge. It involves five basic steps, including how to find shooters that the uthor calls ""rhythmic rollers."" This is great stuff and having played craps for many years I can tell you that no one who has ever written about the game knows the real world of craps the way Scoblete does."
5,Time to Rethink Craps,"I have always believed that there was no way to beat craps. You just had to make the best house-edge bets to keep their hold low over you and enjoy playing. However, Scoblete's book is an eye and a mind opener. His position is that craps can be beaten if certain shooters are slightly altering the game to favor the players.To find these shooters Scoblete has developed his five-step approach. I have used it on my last 6 visits to Reno and Vegas and I have come away a 5 out of the 6 times. The one time I lost it was for very small amounts and the comps I got actually were worth much more than my loss.Craps players who are stuck in the mold of thinking that the game can't be beaten or that there is no approach better than any other approach should read this book ASAP!You will also find that it is a very enjoyable book to read. Scoblete is a great writer and he really can hold your interest, entertain and amuse you, and give you great information at the same time."
1,Puh-lease,"This is yet another self-serving piece of fiction from Mr. Scoblete. He continues to profess the idea of ""the captain"", yet no one has ever seen him but Frank and his close circle of followers.Here, he goes even further, offering up this ""famous"" 5-count, never explaining that the average person tosses only 6 rolls per hand. Yet here he is recommending giving up 5 of those before even considering placing a bet. I wonder if this is the ""Golden Touch"" they speak of...having you hold your bets until a hand is almost over.As like so many other Scoblete craps books, it is long on unverifiable claims and short on beneficial advice. A very disappointing read."
5,A Winner's Handbook,This book has not only made me a lot of money in the last year but it has taught me discipline and how to approach the actual shooting of the dice. It is a masterpiece. Scoblete is a genius.
5,Do You Want to Win Money at Craps?,"Then I recommend you read this book. It shows you exactly how to utilize a rhythm roll to increase your chances of having an edge over the casino. It is the best craps book ever written, even better than Scoblete's first book."
5,Treat Yourself to a Victory,"Frank Scoblete has written an awesome book on how to beat the game of craps utilizing his five-step approach. If you are a craps player, you owe it to yourself to read this book. This is not a betting system but a method using dice control, golden shooters, the 5-Count, comps and best bets to gain an edge over the house. Don't miss out on the chance to actually beat the casinos."
2,Too much jabber. Where is the meat?,"Diappointing in regard to presentation and content. The section dealig with ""the Dark Side"" is pittifully inadequate and bare of any objective analysis. The back cover is heralding Frank Scoblete as ""casino gaming's greatest author"". ""Forever Craps"" does not seem to support such self-serving statement."
3,place bets 4 6 8 9,"I love craps.It has some good tips.""If your number dosen't in five rolls, pull your bet"" I like the advise given in the book."
5,This is a Money Maker,"You will enjoy reading this book because Scoblete writes a fun book with great stories and adventures. More important, once you've read the book and go to the casino you have an excellent chance to win money with the system that Scoblete writes about. It is excellent as I've said and it exploits the only way to beat craps and that is to change the nature of the game by utilizing ""physical"" means such as rhythmic rolling and the five count. I have employed this system for 12 sessions in Atlantic City and it has performed beautifully. No craps player should be without this book! I think it is his best craps book yet."
3,Advantage Gained,"Like most books that promote a single issue a person has to read through a lot of filler to get to the essence of the book which is about four lines. More interesting would be a display of how the five count stands up to other strategies satistically. What is the standard deviation so that a player would know when he has reached the maximum and can go no further? Books that deal with this issue have shown that with any random betting system a wall is hit and the player can win no more or is risking being in that twilight zone of 98 percentile deviation for a short period of time before the dice regresses him to the norm. That's why you continually hear: ""If only I had quit when...."". With Frank's expertise the reader could have been guided through the satistical perils. No matter what system you use there is standard deviation and two standard deviations. This is what makes it seem like you've gotten the game beat."
2,"Weak, little decent information..AGREED","I have had this book for awhile and re-read it last night.. Overall, this book is a disappointing read. The only worthwhile material in the book is the 5-count and his section on crap comps which I thought could have been expanded. The rest is stories and added technical fluff. 5-count is the key in his system and if you do not know what it is, I would pick up one of his books for the concept and knowledge... just not this one.I would recommend 'Winning Craps for the Serious Player' J. Edward Allen. Very good book."
5,Third and Counting!,"I have read all of Mr. Scoblete's books on craps and other games. This one could be his best because he clearly takes a single aspect of craps, how to get on hot shooters, and works out a system that is successful. At least it has been for me. I have been playing this ever since I received this book as a Christmas present and I have won considerable money. Thank Mr. S!"
3,Middle of the road review,"This Conn Song Fluit seems to be identical to the one I had over 50 years ago, but it doesn't seem to play as well...not sure why...maybe out of practice."
4,Great Stuff!,I've been looking for some quiet collections for quiet reading or falling asleep that weren't new age schmaltzy or the same old collections of classical works. This CD hits the spot with restful and unique selections.
2,A cook book that is a Jack-of-All-Trades yet Master-of-None.,"This small-sized book (7 1/4"" x 6"" x 96 pages) has me thinking that it was trying to be a mini-coffee table book. It claims to be ""A fiesta of firey, flavorful recipes"", but 1/3 of it is a discussion of the history, use, and growing of chile peppers. Now don't get me wrong, I found this interesting. I just wish they could have gotten more that 38 recipies in it. Most of the 38 tend to be ""Mexican"" in flavor, which disappointed me because I really was hoping for a more ""international"" look at chile use. It was a good try, but not as good as I had hoped for. It would make a good introductory book for someone who wants to try more spicy foods, but if you already have a cook book in your library that covers this topic, you probably want to give this one a miss."
1,More hatred. Less Credibility,"Obviously, there are those who really, really hate President Bush. The crop of books that are coming out during this election year about the President are similar in inspiration and genius as those that came out about President Bill Clinton in 1996. That is to say they're pieces of garbage, twisted journalism and show more introspection into the dark hearts of their authors than on the subject at hand. Why waste your time reading hate?"
1,"Bilking those harboring the ""right-wing conspiracy"" fantasy","With this work, Mr. Dean has a built-in audience, that segment of the population who attribute all of society's ills to that ""vast right-wing conspiracy."" Poorly researched and highly speculative, this book presents only what the masses get from Rather, Jennings and Brokaw on a daily basis: Mediocre journalism, delivered with a sanctimonious tone and a thinly-veiled bias. Methinks that Dean has exhausted his thirty pieces of silver and needs more money and attention to keep him going for a few more years."
1,More Luny Left Wing Propaganda,Here is more literature which only goes to prove that the left wing in America lives in an alternative reality. Better avoid this one unless you want to get spun right out of your chair.
1,Reader's Digest version of Dean's latest diatribe against all things Republican,"""I hate Bush because he is a Republican"" by John W. Dean."
1,Waste of time,"This book is a waste of time. Written in the style of a junior high student combining internet blogs, there is no serious analysis...just the braying of a discredited felon."
4,Insights into current Washington leadership,"This book gives excellent insights into the ethics,abilities and personalities of those making policy and leading the country. It's not gossip but a serious study that can be easily validated with little effort."
5,Lie detectors,"There is severe Machiavellian chill coming from this new book by John Dean. Beyond the actual facts a sense of dread haunts an author who certainly has some experience with the phenomenon of governmental deception. And really that's what the book is, a sense of the ominous about this government, important information by itself. As the author notes, those who exhude the atmosphere of public deception are those with something to hide and those with something hide are most probably about some business against the best interests of the public.A warning."
5,Valuable Perspective On The Current Bush Administration,"This book is a must-read because Dean was there. Dean ""lived"" inside of the former out-of-control Nixon administration. Now we have the out-of-control Bush administration. Dean address issues including too much secrecy in the current administration.Dean convincingly makes the point that the level of secrecy and scandal in the Bush administration is worse than what happened in the Nixon administration. Dean has the inside knowledge of how administrations work that most of us could never have a clue as to these inside workings. In Dean's estimation, the secrecy with which Bush and Cheney govern is an obessive strategy meant to conceal a deeply troubling agenda of corporate favoritism and a dramatic growth in unchecked power that is putting at risk the lives of American citizens, civil liberties, and the Constitution."
5,A MUST READ!,"Initially I was a bit skeptical about the book, but it turned out to be one of few books I've read this year that truly enlightened me.This book should be made available to all who can read. The level of ignorance in America must be dealt with immediately. And Worse Than Watergate is definitely among the much needed cure. This book also serves as a stern warning to all of us who are subjected by policies and agenda carried out in secrecy of the Bush administration.Only the most deluded and incurable brainwashed people who would find this well-written book of any less than a bright five-star rating.I have bought 50 copies of this book and donated them to libraries and schools around the country because I felt that if Bush and his neo-con friends had their way, I would have never be able to get my hand on this kind of book."
3,Common Thread,"I am suspcious of most politically motivated books. This one is no exception. It seems everyone wants to take potshots at our 43rd commander-in-chief. However, there is a common thread that runs through most of the critiques of the Bush presidency: DECEIT!! These attacks seem more ""on the money"" than ever before in light of the new evidence coming from foreign war correspondents and high-level officials within our own government that the Iraq war was a ""done deal"", and that supposed weapons of mass decep...er destruction,which were the alleged reason for going to war, was just the excuse needed to do what the warmongers were mongering to do from the beginning.The book overdoes it, like most Bush-Bashing books, but is an interesting read, no matter what side of the isle your politicians sit."
3,Bush is Evil - But This Isn't the Best Book on the Subject,"There are few people that have a disdain for Bush any stronger than myself.However, this book by Mr. Dean is not the best I have read on the subject. True, Bush is secretive about many thing...include his energy committee. However, many other disturbing moves this administration has made have been out in the wide open. Thus, the premise that Bush is evil because he is secretive is not really a strong one. It is only ONE of Bush's evils.Frankly, I found Mr. Dean's book to be quite repetitive, and to not really bring any new information to the table.Yes, we should all vote this evil corporate puppet out of office....but save your money on this book. There are better, more interesting, and more revealing books on the subject available."
5,A Scathing Indictement!,"John W. Dean offers expert analysis and in-depth research to expose treachery and secrecy around this administrations actions. Not the usual Bush-bash, the author gives equal attention (rightfully so) to VP chenney. Mr. Dean exposes the tactics used by the white house to prevent the public from learning the truth about nearly everything it does, from the inconsequential to the reprehensible. Read this book."
2,The Secret Presidency of George W Bush,"This book went round and round telling the same thing a different way. Give me a break!!!!! I am glad that I did not buy this book. What president does not have secrets, with Clilton his secrets came out of his closet and because of him we have a generation that don't consider somethings a sexual act.Myself as a citizen do not want to know all. I have my own problems. In this book Dean keeps saying how Bush was lying to congress about Iraq there is one of Bush and a lot of congress.This book could have been written by John Kerry himself."
1,Nonsense,"It's a very opinionated book that is filled with nonsense. It just tells me that anyone can write a book and get it published these days, especially if they're on the liberal elitists' side."
2,Dean at His Worst,This from a bitter man who ignores facts to tarnish two fine men. Why do book companies publish such rubbish?
1,ALL PARTISAN AND NO FACTS!,All this is a bunch of garbage. John Dean hasn't worked to for President Bush so what does he know? All of this is partisan and Dean seems to have a vendetta against Republican presidents. It must be that post Watergate trauma.
5,Every American Should Read This Before November!,"Anyone even considering voting for Bush-Cheney in November should consider it their civic duty to read this exceptional book by John Dean. If, after reading it, you can still justify placing a vote for this ticket, then this country has more to fear than mere terrorists. In fact, the true terrorists bent on destroying what makes this country great are already ensconced in the White House. John Dean merely presents the facts in a very logical, easy-to-read format. I just hope more Americans will read this before it's too late!"
4,Not Your Average Bush-Basher,"This is definitely NOT a cookie-cutter addition to the election-year avalanche of Dubya-drubbing. This is a fascinating legal dissection of the secrecy strategies from someone who knows a bit about the subject. Thinking back to Watergate, a relatively minor crime ballooned into the removal of a president because of the stratagems of cover-up. And Dean lays out a compelling account of much worse attempts by the current regime to dodge accountability at every turn. It's worth buying in hardcover."
3,What would Dean say now?,"A very interesting book. John Dean has been in politics as long as I can remember, and that's a long time. There are only a few dry parts but for the most part Mr. Dean holds your interest.Anyone that is truthful with themselves, will not find anything false. If you have any memory of 2000 to 2004, this will be a great reminder of the reasons why the country was so anxious to get rid of Bush and Cheney. There is no mention of Katrina or the domestic problems that plagued the country during this period. Of course, 9/11 was a prevalent subject. The title is perfect since john Dean worked in the Nixon administration, and could use the worst behavior of a former president as a good comparison.It would be a good exercise to replace the name Bush with Obama. Nearly every point that John Dean disdains is being used now in the White House, only much worse.I would love to see what Jihn Dean would write about the current white house occupants."
2,As bad as Watergate?...maybe,"As an idea, comparing Bush's presidency to the presidency of Nixon, its an intriguing theory. Dean offers an interesting perspective of the secrecy surrounding the White House.However, he doesn't offer much proof. Its more in line with the reasoning the Bush admin has stating there are WMDs in Iraq, although there is no convincing supporting evidence of it. The end result is a book where it reinforces your beliefs going in--if you don't like Bush, you'll love it, if you do you'll notice its flaws. (For the record, I dont like Bush, but I cant support the book as flimsy as this)."
1,Overblown with iccuracies,This book was a waste of my time. The author had a political agenda that was very glaring. He did not in anyway present a clear cut case for his indictment of the Bush administration. And much of his information was factually wrong.I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this book and would not recommend it to others. The administration has done plenty wrong - but indicting it with myth instead of fact is just as wrong.
1,False Premise,"To be honest I did not think I would like this book so rather than buy it I borrowed it from a coworker. After getting about halfway through it I had enough. Mr. Dean's premise is that the administration deceived (i.e. manipulated intelligence on WMDs) this country into going to war. The problem I have with this theory is that our Intelligences agencies provided the President and Congress with the same information and based on this same information Congress voted to give Bush authority to use military force. Too, British, French, and German Intelligence all believed that Iraq had WMDs, hence the reason for the UN resolutions that were broken 17 times. Therefore, I found it foolish to continue a book whose premise I found badly flawed."
1,Who proofread this book?,"I was interested to read this book. Once I got into it however I realized it was hard to read because it jumps around and I also found many misspelled words.I was also looking for solid proof about Bush being worse than Nixon, or even Johnson. However it's all theory that doesn't stand up to my scrutiny. Unfortunately it's just one more joe looking to make a buck off W."
3,Be wary of John Dean,"I find it hard to believe people aren't more critical of John Dean, especially when it comes to political matters. If you enjoyed this book, read the eye opening ""Slient Coup"" for more information."
5,Couldn't put it down,"This is a book that grabs you! I couldn't put it down once I started it. I definitely agree that this is one of the most crooked, deceptive, and secretive administrations this country has ever had. After reading this book, I feel we need a change in leadership. We have got to get this country back on the right track. I think George Bush is a likable person, but as a president, he is clueless how to run the country. This book backs up my belief's. This book is a great read!"
3,Just the facts?,"As a point of reference, never trust a book review that goes out of its way to mention the word ""fact"" or ""fact based"" in each of its inclusive sentences. Should be a red flag for anyone looking for, well, facts.Speaking of which, the fact is (I'm making my predecessors error?), this guy has none. The book itself is not bad - its well written, almost logical discourse attacking our nations acting president. Thats all fine and well. Its important to understand, however, that this is one mans opinion. Often, what is purported as fact in the text is little more than base assumption, a probable (at best) conclusion drawn from factual premises. One must understand the distinction.If you're interested in an insiders account of the Bush presidency from as arbitrary a source as feasable, stick with ""Bush at War.""Regardless of where you stand on the issue, if your interested in hearing a liberal perspective on the Bush presidency, then read ""Worse than Watergate."""
1,The Offal Truth,"This guy is so full of it he needs to have a tongue depressor applied by a proctologist. Arch calumnist John Dean has managed to make a successful parasitic career out of reflexively criticizing Republican administrations for is DNC paymasters. In this barely legible peice of fiction Dean proceeds to demonize Bush and co for a whole list of constitutional breaches which were the common currency of the Clinton administration. Dean is now comfortably and firmly ensconsed as a Beltway insider who differs little from a medieval European monarch who mistakenly believes that the world is flat. If freedom of speech required footnotes, John Dean's literary ventures would be notably bereft of sources. I will concede, however, that Dean-like lemmings will find it a worthwhile read-that is assuming they can read."
1,I wish they would have kept walking and never came back.,"This book was annoying, overlong, dull and pointless! Mabey she was pulling a ""Auel"" and thought that many, many pages of nothing would mask the fact that this book was a dud. The main characters who we did care about once have a fight and one of them goes walking, and the other is left behind in a village of people who cannot take a stand on anything. Ok, at what point was any of this supposed to be worth our time and money?"
4,Above Average; 3.5 Stars,"A good thriller based on the much used theme of Soviet moles in the British establishment, notably a ""Fifth Man"" recruited along with Anthony Blunt, Kim Philby, etc. The Cambridge Theorem is distinctive in 2 respects. This book is written more as a police procedural murder mystery than the typical thriller and the protagonist is mildly unconventional but intelligent policeman. The quality of writing is solid. A diverting read."
3,Not Bad,"This author writes tight, slick books that keep you interested through out. This is an interesting book that combines espionage with a murder mystery. Ok so the detective that is used is straight from central casting, but that book is not bad. The story comes together and you believe it. I would have liked a bit more depth on the locations and characters, but not a bad read."
1,Poor Service (again),"The product is fine - although I had to refuse to accept delivery on the first order because it was sent to the billing rather than the shipping address. (Although Amazon sent a confirmation email showing the correct shipping address.) The company (Etronics) said they couldn't help me, it was Amazon's problem, etc. etc.A very frustrating and disappointing experience. I am waiting to see what the billing problems will be..."
3,got what I paid for....but they're dead now.,"I bought these a year ago, to take to the park with me. They sound alright, and the volume is ok. But despite being very careful with them, especially about putting the cord away properly, they're now basically dead. They cut in and out, and the problem is at the base of the cord.Other thoughts:-no battery indicator - plus, the 'on' light requires so little power that the light comes on even when there isn't enough power to run the speakers. I advise always carrying a spare set of batteries with you.-you always need to turn the volume up each time you use them, as they start at the lowest volumeI suppose I got what I paid for. But I just hoped that they would last longer, especially considering that I take good care of my things."
2,"Looks good, sounds marginal.",About a couple months ago I bought this speaker(s). it is easy to connect and having power from a USB port makes it very convenient. The problem is that the sound quality is poor which is the main reason you buy speakers for.
4,Audio Source,"I really like the sound on these speakers for my little MP3 player. My son, with more sophisticated tastes in equipment than I is using it on the laptop rather than the default speakers and also likes it. I was only disappointed that it didn't come with a plug attachment and doesn't specify which one is best to buy."
3,Somebody's gotta break the 5 star trend,"Well, from the 14 other reviews giving this product 5 stars, I thought I found a pair of speakers that were better and cheaper than the competition, especially with them boasting a 60 Hz to 33 kHz frequency response(the frequency response claimed in the owners manual is 100 Hz thru 20 kHz). In reality, these speakers are cheap, I will not oppose that argument. But the fact of the matter is that once they are turned up beyond the listening volume of normal laptop speakers, the distortion is REALLY bad. Songs with more bass than a normal alternative rock song were distorted so badly I could not hear the lyrics behind the bass, just a mess of jarbled notes. For the money, they will suffice for soft music in the office, but if you want to hear the music outside of the room you are in, get a pair ofJBL OnTour Portable Music BoxorVirgin VS0200 Boomtube Portable Speakers."
3,Nice but the specs are not quite as quoted,"I bought this DB-5 based on the reviews. The Unit is well build and compact. Good enough for travel and better than my laptop speakers. But beware that both and treble & base will not reach the amazon quote of 60hz - 33Khz. The max these speakers will reach are 100hz - 20Khz (-3db).And Power is not 7W (total)(3.5Watts/channel) but are 4W (total peak) (2 watts per channel into 6 ohms).Sound wise the base lacks clarity and distortion increases proportionally with volume. For the cost of the DB-5 one can't complain, but could I make my decision to buy a pair of speakers all over again, I would gladly pay a few extra bucks to get a clearer sound for both bass & treble."
4,Good quality for the money.,The Audio Source DB5 speakers are a great little pair of speakers that have good sound quality and are easy to travel with. The only problem I had was getting the battery cover off. After ten minutes of trying I finally had to use a screw driver to get it open.
5,Perfect gift for teenager,"I bought these speakers for my teenage son, who is always wearing his Ipod. He is enjoying the speakers. They produce great sound and are easy to use. They are also nice and compact. I chose this item due to the high rating among other purchasers, and I am so glad I did. I can't back-up my praise with technicalities. I just know that I have a happy teenager. How cool is that?"
1,Not a Good Design,"Unfortunately, mine also died after just a few weeks of moderate use. I think there is a design flaw with the wiring. I really liked it otherwise and was very disappointed when it started to cut out intermittently for no reason.I'm still in search of a good portable speaker for my mp3."
5,Great speakers!,I guess the secret is out! When I purchased these they cost me $24 including shipping. I was surprise with how quickly I recieved them. Very Fast shipping. I bought a second set to give to my daughter. Great speakers!
4,Great for audio (not music),"This little speaker is inexpensive, runs on AA batteries exclusively, and has enough volume to allow you to listen to an audiobook without earbuds. But it is not for music."
4,excellent value for the price,"If you need a portable MP3 speaker device for those times when earphones aren't practical, then you can't beat the value afforded by the Audio Source DB5 system. Packaging is impressive, connections easy, and while it doesn't provide Bose quality sound, it is more than adequate for the price they ask. I like having all of my music available to me and am using it today while I'm getting some painting done in our hallway. If you need inexpensive speaker access to your MP3 playlists, you can't go wrong with this purchase."
4,Definitely would buy them again,"These little battery-powered speakers work well. They are not high fidelity speakers. I use them primarily to listen to spoken podcasts, not music. But they're OK for music, too. For inexpensive, very portable speakers, they do the job just fine."
5,Perfect,"""I love these speakers! They are exactly what I was looking for. I checked around at my local stores, including Staples and Best Buy and I could not find good portable speakers for my laptop. These are perfect and arrived quickly."""
5,Great Buy,"I purchased this speaker system to use with my MP3 player. I wanted something that would be easy to carry around and would fit in my purse if needed to, as well as something with really great sound. This audio speaker system more than meets my expectations. The quality of sound is great and the system is easy to operate. The storage box is bulky and something that you would not want to carry around, but that was easily solved with a small cosmetic bag. It now fits right in my purse or carry on case if traveling. I can use my speakers by the bedside, on the beach or anywhere you want music. It uses batteries but can be used with an AC adapter. I would recommend this product."
1,"Decent sound, stopped working after two months","Surprisingly good sound from such small drivers, nothing earth shaking but better than the JBL On tour system, which while louder, have terrible sound.Sadly, these died on me after only two months of moderate use, never abused, just started spontaineously shutting off, volume dropping, then not working at all.Pity.Will continue to search for a reliable portable speaker set."
2,Distortion,"Every time you turn the speaker son you'll have to adjust the volume, because it always starts so low you can't hear anything.On the other hand, if you turn it up too high there's distortion that messes up the bass.The 3D button doesn't really make a noticeable difference, but the fact you can take it with you everywhere is nice.Over all I wouldn't buy them again."
2,Amazing - for about a month!!!,"I got this unit and was amazed by the sound. I used it in my car for the 40 minute drive to work with my mp3 player, really sounded first class. When I get to work at the high school, I can close it up and put it away, no worries about theft. However, after a month of opening and closing it everyday, the really badly designed wire leading to the mp3 jack started to cut. I tried electrical and scotch tape, but the wired just kept cutting. Shortly thereafter, the sound stopped. Now if I wiggle the wire, I may get sound as long as I do not move! This is a great sounding set, it just suffers from bad design. If you buy it, be cafeful of the back wire, maybe tape it down from the beginning and it might last longer."
3,Forgotten 80's romantic comedy is a guilty pleasure,"These days, 80's movies are much-maligned. And watching movies like The Slugger's Wife, you gotta admit, a lot of stuff from back then is hard to watch. But I think this one holds up reasonably well. Movies based on Neil Simon plays were popular in the seventies, but were a bit hit-and-miss by 1985 (see also:Brighton Beach Memoirs,Biloxi Blues). Anyway, the prime reason to catch this one--or at least it was the prime reason some two decades ago--is Rebecca DeMornay. Although it would be a stretch call her a great actress, the title role her suits her talents. And yes, that really is her singing (I'm a little ashamed to admit I have the soundtrack on cassette somewhere). As someone else has pointed out, the keyboard-heavy soundtrack does hopelessly date the film.But if you long for a simpler time, when movies wanted nothing more than just ENTERTAIN you for a couple of hours, you could do a lot worse than The Slugger's Wife."
4,Bats about .300,"""I'm rotten, but I'm smart"", one of the best lines uttered in this film. There are certainly some cheesey scenes and the baseball scenes themselves are not all that great, especially compared to a film like Major League. Someone else made mention of the 80's baseball film genre and that's pretty accurate. I had never heard of this film until I stumbled upon it recently at a used DVD place.Randy Quaid is an added bonus. This is an interesting role for Michael O'Keefe, I keep picturing him as Danny in Caddyshack. I never pictured Danny setting the MLB single season homerun record. There is some bad acting in this film, some scenes are really forced. A true baseball fan will like the film. I liked the voices of the old TBS guys in some of the play calling. I also enjoyed the old Braves, Padres, Phillies and Astros uniforms. Baseball fans...add this one to the collection."
2,The Disco Singer's Husband,"As a serious drama, it is uneven; as a musical, the singing is mediocre; as a romantic comedy, it is gloomy, lewd and noisy; as a baseball movie it is unrealistic. It is also misnamed as it is more about the slugger than the singer. It isn't terrible. Darryl Porter (Michael O'Keefe) is a sympathetic character and Burly (Martin Ritt) has some good lines. ""You know what makes really good champagne? Winning."" But, it is seriously flawed. It does have a cameo by the irrepressible Mark ""The Bird"" Fidrych. I wish it had utilized him more. I miss him."
4,LG Bluetooth Headset,"I like the size and light weight of this headset; it has a thin wire around the ear so sunglasses can fit comfortably with it.Once I figured out how to use the power on and push button features, I liked the convenience of using it also. (helps to read the instructions)The volume and microphone also work very well."
1,Worthless,"Begin by trying to jam this item into your ear so that it might have a chance of staying in. It won't. (The ear loop, which isn't adjustable, certainly doesn't fit my ear.) While you are trying, there will be no way to avoid hitting the multi-function button, so you will be incessantly pestered to ""please say a command"". Unfortunately, ""stay in my ear"" is not one of them. Neither are ""off"", ""no command"", ""shut up"", or anything else that might indicate ""oops, I didn't mean to say a command"". So she keeps pestering. If you do manage to get the bud to stay in your ear for a second, get ready to blow your ear out while dialing. (I have my keypad volume and the volume on the headset both as low as they can go, but it still hurts my ears.) Once the other end begins ringing, the headset will soon be sliding out. When you go to push it back in, you will, of course, hit the MF button again, hanging up your call. Complete waste of money."
2,Returned it,"Physically, this is an excellent design. It's very light and very adjustable. The sound quality from the ear piece is excellent. I had several people tell me they could barely hear me, though. I have not had trouble using Jabra and Plantronics headsets with my current phone, so I'm inclined to think it is the mic in this one."
1,Good for about the first month,"This seemed like a pretty good headset at the start, getting it connected wasn't too difficult, the light weight/small size was awesome. But soon I did run into some cons:Connection to the headset had a tendency to break on a regular basis. Usually after I had made a few calls, and then received an incoming call. So like another reviewer mentioned I would be driving down the road with the headset in one ear and my phone on the other.The headset falls out often. I have a bigger then usual ear I guess, but still. Other headsets are adjustable in one way or another, this one is not.After a month of only periodic use, the sound quality has become horrible. LG has been less then helpful with this issue. Either my unit became damaged, or maybe it was defective from day one. Either way it's destined for the junk gadget pile now..."
4,Wish it lasted longer!,"This was my very first Bluetooth headset, and it became my standard for all my subsequent purchases. I have owned 4 headsets, and have tried several more. This one, despite with being the cheapest, was my favourite.Pros:-The call quality is decent (great for the price)-Fits (me) beautifully & is very light-Is easy to pair & use. Not a single problem with LG CU575 (Trax)-Battery life is great-Buttons are easy to pressCons:-It broke in just under 6 months. In two places. The rotating ear hook holder fell off and the earpiece itself snapped off the device. It has been through some abuse, but it felt flimsy to begin with in those places.-Undoing cover to charge it every time is somewhat a pain-The outgoing call quality (mic) could be betterAfter it broke, I tried replacing it with 3 different brands and ended up just buying a (newer) LG earpiece (HBM-770) with the hope that it improves on the formula. It doesn't. I'd rather have this one, for less $$."
3,Easy to break,"I've had mine for about a year. Unfortunately, a couple of days ago when I reached to get it in my purse, I found it had broken. The ear bud broke off from the rest of the device and was dangling by some wires. I used some super glue to fix it; that lasted a day; and now, off to buy a new one."
1,NO THE BEST,This is the 2nd one of these I have purchased. The little ear piece came off. SO not able to use it. It didn't last very long. I wouldn't buy one again.
3,Great little product but battery hour sucks!,"Like I said in the title, this Bluetooth is awesome given its chic size and outlook. Sound quality is also very good.However, I have to charge it all the time so I find it a bit inconvenient. I suggest you to spend more $$ to get a LG with longer battery hours."
1,LG HBM -730 Bluetooth Headset,Not what I expected... Hard to fit properly in the ear. Confusing controls. Pron to accidental actions. Hard to tell if it is working or not working. No indication of battery power status. Manual is printed so small that you need a magnifying glass to read it. Would not recommend purchase.
4,LG bluetooth,"I like this headset. Setup was quick, voice recognition is great, very lightweight and comfortable."
2,AVIOD THIS,I BOUGHT THIS THINKING IT WOULD PAIR WELL WITH MY LG PHONE HOWEVER I FOUND THAT THERE WERE CONECTIONPROBLEM ANDMORE ANOOYIYING THAN ANYTHING WAS THE FIT. THAT LITTLE WIRE EAR HOOK DOESN'T KEEP THE UNIT IN PLACE IN YOUR EAR.
3,Great fun and learning at the same time!,"My children, ages 3 and 6, like this game but there are only a few games to play. My 3 year old seemed to enjoy it more than my older child. Unless there are other games that have to be unlocked, I dont think this was worth the buy. Much more enjoyable for younger computer savvy kids."
5,"Old-fashioned,. hardboiled private eye stories","Tequila Sunrise contains seven private eye stories, all great. These stories are faithful to the hardboiled genre, and make no apology for their rough, tough nature.I knew I was in for a good time when Nathaniel Rose's car blew up on page one of the first story. The excitement and suspense didn't let up until the last page of the last story.If you like stories of private eyes with codes of honor, willing to do what it takes to find the truth no matter wshat the personal cost, this is the book for you."
4,Love and Mystery in the Florida Keys,"I found this book to be lyrical, introspective and intriguing. The characters in this book are right out of the Florida Keys. I felt I knew some of them, because they are so familiar here. Brackenbury poetically describes Key West with accuracy and precision. Her characters seem very real. Cuba appears fascinating, as did Raoul, Emilia's Cuban husband. It's really a simple tale about complex emotions and love. The story slowly pulls you in, drawing you in to its current until the very end."
2,I like Billy but...,This bio's just too dry. His organization's info structure's never mentioned. Lots of unecessary stadium figuers predominate. I can't recomend this.
3,Bluegrass Aero,"I have about every thing Aerosmith has put out so buying this cd was inevitable. I'm a rock and roll fan and a bluegrass fan. I like this CD. If your looking for this to pump you up, it won't but I found it to be execellent background music. I thought Mama Kin and Dream On were great.I enjoy listening to Aerosmith's music in a differnt light, this CD does just that. It's enjoyable to hear Perry's licks played on a dobro or Tyler's lyrics relayed by a Harmonica (Dream On).I would recommend this CD to friends"
5,I bought about three of these off of ebay,This stockpot is the best of all the Visions offerings. The worst being the skillet.It's great for popping corn too.
4,Just what I was looking for!,"I bought this pot because I've been cooking for a friend with cancer who prefers non-reactive cookware, but I'm thrilled with the Visions line for my general use as well. It's easy to clean, easy to see when something is boiling, and this size is particularly good for family size cooking. I looked first in several cooking stores/departments and no one carried it anymore in my area, so thanks to Amazon for keeping the stock for a great product!"
4,The most-used pot in the house,"I use it for boiling water for pasta, and in the microwave to make pudding and heating milk for yogurt. It's the perfect size to avoid bubble-overs, and being able to see if anything is sticking or thickening is a bonus."
3,"It was nice, but...","I returned it. I was interested in trying out a few different blankets, and I LOVE the Luxe Baby Blankets by Koala soooo much more! The only thing I liked better about this blanket than the Luxe is the size - it's larger, which would be nicer for an older child/toddler. Ultimately, though, since I only have room for so many blankets in the closet, I had to stick with the one that is the softest blanket I've ever touched."
3,A book of scores - but more stories would be welcomed.,"I picked the book up thinking it was just a list of arcade game scores - but the author chose to also include scores for home video game systems as well. Since the focus of the recollections at the end of the book were about arcade games, a separate book for home systems would be more appropriate. A majority of the entries are for Nintendo systems, which were provided by Nintendo itself, and some are carried out to the top 250 scores. Surely the top 10 would have been plenty. On the plus side are the 200 pages of stories from the Golden Age of arcades. This is the highlight of the book, and despite the author getting a bit self-important at times, makes for very entertaining reading for those of us who were there. If you were an arcade junkie in the early 80's, you may get a kick out of it."
4,Fun game!,"We bought this toy, and my 5 year old son just LOVES it!! He woke up at 530AM to play it, the day after we bought it!!! My only question is, where am I to find the ""game key"" to ""unlock more fun""?? I see one other comment, asking the same thing. I have looked all over ToysRUs.com, not to mention I used other search engines, and I have come up with nothing. I would really like to buy the ""key"" so my son can have even more fun with his neat new game."
4,dbz rules(but where can i get a game key for this product?),this game was fun and still is every now and then u just have to play it a bit/ the story mode is much more fun than the others /its all good/ BUT WHERE CAN I FIND GAME KEY!!!
3,Not That Good,I just got the Dragon Ball Z Controller with 3-in-1 TV Games for Christmas and the online pictures are wrong Its not like Budokai or Tenkieci
3,"Tracks from days of 78s, obscure revivals",No great music -- Sammy did regular studio accomp -- but nice to hear some of the singers from the glory days of Decca semi-race issues. Good audio.
5,"A useful integration of the core buddhist values of presense, insight and awareness in the therapeutic encounter","This text provided clear guidance and inspiration for changing my daily experience of therapy with my patients--to our mutual benefit. For those unfamiliar with the basics of buddhist thought, the book may be more of a challenge to integrate with a therapist's specific approach."
1,Not for ordinary listner,This might be a good teaching aid for opera student but not for a casual listner like me.Worst of all the high pitch clipping noise of recording is terrible and the balance ofpiano and vocal sound is way off. Beautiful cd cover but horrible sound.
2,This CD is for Mezzo fans!,"If you prefer heavy voice and live music, this Cd is for you. Otherwise you will be annoyed by the breathy tone and noise by the audiences. well, for that reason try to listen to before you buy. I prefer her studio recorded version better than this. once again, this CD is not for everyone. Do not be hoaxed by marketing or review by someone who prefers mezzo voice."
2,Who doesn't already know this stuff?,"There isn't much in this book that benefits real people. It reads like a catalog for online resources and household items (""Yes, this stuff really works as advertised!""). It also leans heavily toward people who are building their homes from the ground up. The rest is just obvious common sense (""if two people are sharing a dresser, each person should have his or her own drawers""). The only somewhat redeeming chapter is ""Taking Charge of Your Day"", which attempts to help maximize time spent during the day through priortization. Again, mostly common sense advice which served more as a reminder of what I already knew than an original, concrete approach. Overall, I learned more from my mom growing up than I did from this book."
1,This book is a joke!,"What a waste of money! Too bad I didn't come to Amazon first to read other customer's reviews before buying this book. The author spends too much of the book discussing what furniture and appliances to buy. If I'm like most people who would pick us this book, we just want to know how to organzie the things we already own. For example, the entire chapter on organizing the laundry room is about what type of washer/dryer to buy and how to wash your clothes properly. Nothing at all about organization! I didn't learn one new thing, but it will make a nice donation to our school's annual book sale/fundraiser."
1,Unintended motivation,"Tho it probably was not the author's intention he gets you in the mood of throwing junk out with this book being the first item. Nothing new here, just another cookie cutter, turn the crank, book mill."
4,Good for coaches & players,"An extremely useful book on a hard to find topic. Based on the English National men's side, focuses on a year long training plan. Also includes chapters on specific drills and weight exercises by player position, how to improve speed, etc. Slightly unrealistic chapter on eating habits for rugby players--veggie pizza & salad? Good for coaches and for individuals wanting to beef up their own regime."
3,Not quite,"I'm in the middle of the sizing, but this was a little loose for me. I expected something with a firmer control hold."
2,Pass on this one,"I started taking lessons about a month ago and right away my instructor insisted I get a new chanter. This chanter did help me figure out how to play the nine notes and grace note scale but it sounds funny when played along side a better quality chanter. It also has some defects tht my instructor pointed out. The top three holes are not lined up making it difficult to play at times. I have recently replaced it with a Dunbar chanter sold by ""Universe of Bagpipes"" for a kit price of $99. That $20 extra is worth spending on a quality chanter unlike my self who now spent $178. $79 of which was wasted on the Caledonia chanter kit. Other quality chanters for a fair price are Naill and Gibson plus others."
4,"All in All, A good C.D.","Nice selection of tunes.Fills out my oldies collection well.As I have the rest of the series.The original hits, to be sure.Gimme Gimme Good Lovin could be a little cleaner in sound, for my taste.But maybe that's the way it was recorded.I've yet to find one that's better sound than this c.d.I say, if you don't have the tunes on it, get it!"
