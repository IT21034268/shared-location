3,Dirty Business,"This a book by a Black author about Harlem in the 60's. It is not a story, but a series of incidents leading the protagonist, one of a team of Black cops, to conclude ""It don't make no sense."" It portrays every negative aspect of the community: crime; vice; brutality; ignorance; mindless, purposeless plunging forward.The title character symbolizes the whole enterprise. Is this picture fair or accurate? It overflows with violence. It is not dull, but neither is it pleasant to read."
1,Wasn't satisfied with this novel...*spoilers maybe*,"This book reads like a first draft. As if there are ideas present, and they need to be fleshed out in order to make the story more coherent.As it--""Blind Man with a Pistol""--stands, it is a confusing mess. It was a task to read and finish.There are several plots or characters that are brought up, but never really resolved or delved into:-An old black man with mistresses that are nuns.-An African doctor who is killed.-A white man who comes to Harlem to sleep with black girl is killed-A radical black man who is in a relationship with a Swedish girl.-The first riot that occurs in the story.-The character Fat Sam.There is no character development, no one to latch onto.I am aware of Chester Himes and his other novels, specifically ""Cotton Comes to Harlem"" which was made into a film in the 1970s and ""Rage in Harlem"" which came out in the 1990s; ""Blind Man..."" didn't exactly cut it.I still am interested in Himes' other novels, though."
2,Blind Man with a Typewriter,"For heavens sake, don't read this last book in Himes' Harlem detective series until you have read all the others. This last book is exactly how to kill a series. It's not a whole story at all. It's just three or four utterly unrelated pieces slapped together. Taken on their own, the individual pieces are good enough, and the opening chapter is gripping. The overall impression, however, is that Himes took unrelated pieces written when he was younger and slapped them together to make a final book. The racial politics also grows more radical and trite in this book."
2,Sub Standard Quality,"I was looking forward to wearing this costume but was very unhappy on opening the box. The costume did come as avertised but the quality of the costume is very poor.1. There is no back to the leg and cod parts and they are fastend by 4 pieces of string, these do not keep them in place.2. The chest is held in place by one strap of velcro on the back which does nothing to hold in place.3. The full mask was out of shape and did not fit correctly.4. The overall rubber material was of a low quality and does not reflect the overall price tag.I have returned the costume and I am now looking for an alternative."
4,Very cute,"I love this for my China themed tank. The Fu dogs are awesome and ferocious looking, the paint job is better than a lot of aquarium stuff I've seen, it seems sturdy. My only issue.. The square pedestals the fu dogs are on are not placed squarely. I doubt anyone else would notice if they came to look at my tank but it kind of annoys me. I'm still keeping it though."
1,MORE LUCY SHOW BOOTLEGS!!,"Do not buy!! They are terrible quality and are illegal bootlegs. I wish someone would shut these companies down. At least the music unions could, because we know they didn't pay to clear the music either!!The official fifth season of The Lucy Show will be released on December 6th. On that upcoming release, the episodes have been beautifully remastered in HD from the film negatives. They look like night and day when compared to this cheap release."
1,absolute garbage,"This model cube is known throughout the cubing community as the biggest piece of garbage. Everyone avoids them. It's called the ""dollar store cube"". Nobody in their right mind would use this as a speed cube, so I don't know where these other guys are coming from.I have dozens of cubes, and this puzzle is by far the worst. The quality is absolutely horrible. Yea, it has tiles, but it really does not make up for the poor quality of the cube mechanism. If you try to lube it with silicon, the pieces melt together.Seriously, spend a few extra dollars for a rubik's brand, or better yet, a DIY (do it yourself kit). If you want durable stickers or tiles, search for cubesmith, and get a set of tiles from them."
1,Very frustrating,"I'm one of the geeks who knows how to solve the cube. Fluidity of turning is very important. Not only does this cube not turn well. When it catches it tends to fall apart. It's very frustrating.I agree that the stickers on the Rubik's Cube can be frustrating. But the Rubik's version performs so much better. If you only solve one side once in a while and want a cube for the novelty factor, this would be fine. But if you're looking for a cube that performs, turns and solves without frustrating catches and breaking apart, this cube is not for you."
3,Terrible! Just Terrible!,"First off, I would like to say that the Old Brand Magic Square was an extremely fun Rubik's Cube for me to toy around with and I've already solved it many times. It has also been my first! However, this cube only lasts for about a week. After hours of turning around the cubes, two fell out and the edges of these cubes broke on the inside (in every Rubik's Cube, there is a mechanism that holds it together). Without these edges, the small cubes would continue to pop out while your turn it and this makes the cube really difficult to solve. I tried to glue them back together, but that didn't work very well. Whenever I try to solve the cube, pieces pop out and I have to put them back in. I definitely do not recommend this product and it's not for speed-cubing either!"
3,One size does not fit all bears,"Yes, the patterns are very appealing. But they are all for a 13 1/2-inch bear, with a few thrown in for a 9-inch bear. If you happen to have a 15-inch bear, or an 18-inch bear, or any other standard size, you are going to have to adjust every pattern you want to knit for your bear. And since the patterns all are written for one specific brand of yarn, with little indication of the weights of the yarns used in the patterns, you will also have to figure out from the gauges given what yarns you can use with these patterns. None of this makes for a quick or simple start to a knitting project.Postscript: the first project I began had errors in the diagrams for the Aran cables. You'll have to correct instructions, too."
3,Not for beginners,"I was very excited when I ordered this book, the photos are beautiful and the designs stunning. However, I find the patterns extremely difficult to follow, they are badly explained and unless you are a very seasoned knitter and can work the pattern out from the diagram this is definitely not the book for you."
5,Beautiful book but NOT for the beginner,"This is a truly enchanting book. Yes, the patterns need adjusting to fit different size teddies, but that should not be much of a problem for anybody who has done knitting beyond scarves. The patterns are given by count, and where there might not be a ready count it's easy to count out the pattern on the graph. Since I crochet my own teddy bears and then dress them in different outfits, adjusting any pattern is a must for me and not a problem. The sweaters knit up easy in terms of pattern. I started on the squirrel sweater on the front page last night but had to modify the sweater to fit my bear, and I am using set-in sleeves. The squirrel came out perfect, love this book!"
5,Ovations for Marian!,"`When Marian Sang' is a historical account of the singing career of Marian Anderson. It is a 2003 Orbus Pictus Award winner, and it is no wonder why. This story highlights the struggles Marian faced due to racial discrimination. Through her determination and her never-ending sight of her dreams, she conquered prejudice and became a worldwide sensation. This story follows Marian from her childhood through to her amazing performance at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. as an adult. The pictures are large, beautiful and warm. The back of the book includes notes from the author and illustrator, as well as ""ovations"" and notable dates from Marian's life. I will definitely be keeping this book on the shelf in my future classroom."
3,corporate James Bond,"The movie is sort of James Bond without sudden death?Julia Roberts plays a spy who tricks Clive Owen in the openingonly to later fall for him. They scheme to make a big score in corporate espionageonly to have the tables turned on them.The plot never really works right or gets dangerous enoughto be really exciting, so the result is a very luke warm film,but the acting is mostly first rate."
1,Writers in Love with Their Cleverness,"There is a certain egotism in writing to display how clever one can be which is all that this movie leaves you with. The story is a copy of the standard fare of let's see how complex and unrealistic a plot we can flash forward/backward enough to create puzzlement in an attempt to show ""clever"" but which ends up being needlessly confusing. So pointless was this story that it very slowly drags the audience into the Neverland of boredom. Oh, and the acting is as 2-D flat and unemotional as a Saturday morning cartoon."
2,How to make Julia Roberts unattractive,"A ""caper"" about industrial espionage. Really? Yawn. However, this movie does accomplish something that will go down in movie history: the first time that filmmakers actually managed to make Julia Roberts unattractive. After losing so much weight that she looks emaciated, with sunken eyes and cheekbones that give the appearance of a skull too close to the surface, Roberts' head was also plastered with one of the ugliest hairstyles imaginable. Congratulations to the director and producers for earning such recognition in the history of cinema!"
2,WEAK IMITATION OF OCEANS ELEVEN TYPE FILMS,"Duplicity is a weak imitation of Oceans Eleven and other caper type films, with a couple standing in for the eleven, and duplicity clouding the waters at every turn. You're never really sure what is going on because you can't trust anyone, including writer-director Tony Gilroy. And you know the worst of it? I hate to say it, but Julia Roberts, one of my all-time favorite actresses, is starting to look a little worse for wear. I first noticed it in Oceans Eleven. I think she needs to start thinking about playing characters other than sexy, glamorous types. And Clive Owen is not a lot better. Any way you look at it, this is one weak film.Waitsel Smith"
3,When spies fall in love,"If you ever thought that Julia Roberts and Richard Gere have unmistakable onscreen chemistry, wait until you see ""Duplicity"" with Julia Roberts and Clive Owen together. However, that is not why you want to see this movie. What makes movie unforgettable is roles played by Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamati. These two play two rival CEOs who are so resentful of each other that they get into a fist fight. When you see these two at each other, in slow motion no less, makes this movie worth watching. Never mind it happens at the beggining of the movie. The fist fight scene gives this film so much credit, that the rest of is there to take it away by the time movie is over."
4,Neo-classic caper comedy,"This movie is kind of a new age caper movie...you know, where someone is scamming someone else. You have to watch it closely. I had to pause it halfway to explain who was doing what to whom to the better half. But there are some nice twists at the end that pay off.Naming an old movie, if you liked The StingThe Sting(not as a period piece, but for the caper), this one is for you."
3,Duplicity,This movie was hard for me to understand. It was complicated. Not your normal Julia Roberts movie. It was intense.I wished I would have chosen a different movie after I watched it.
1,One word sums it up... BORING,"I love Julia Roberts. I love Clive Owen. I hate this movie. I could only get through 50 minutes of the 125 minute film. It was just too painful because its so boring. The dialogue felt really forced between the characters. I didn't feel like I was watching real people. Everyone is so busy trying to be clever and ""cool"" with every line that the focus of the plot becomes terribly lost. This is the first time I watched a Julia Roberts film that I couldn't finish."
3,Worlds within worlds within worlds,"Where is the dupe in duplicity?Ex-intelligence operatives Julia Roberts and Clive Owen decide to go into business for themselves. Moreover, they would not mind being romantically evolved. The only problem is can they trust each other. They take an economic opportunity by infiltrating two rival pharmaceutical companies. Each company uses all sorts of tactics to get one up on each other. Will the ex-agents succeed with any of their goals?The film relies excessively much on flashbacks within flashbacks to the point that the whole film is just one big flashback. It is very annoying. It goes out of the way to mask needed information from us instill it is over explained in the flashback.I found the movie fun to watch. I was occasionally misled. Now if they could have just gotten rid of all the flash backs.The Thirteenth Floor [Blu-ray]"
3,Needs a Suspense Injection,"Julia Roberts and Clive Owen play lovers who play each other. They are ensconced in a game of corporate espionage. Of course, multiple millions are at stake. There's a lot of clever dialogue. Owen and Roberts are top-notch actors who create some magic moments.But there's just too much confusing skipping back and forth in place and time. Too much spy, counter-spy. And it's hard to get worked up about either the product they are trying to steal or the game plan that they use. A film doctor might prescribe a suspense injection.Basically, it's the old he/she loves me, he/she loves me not, done fairly well. But it's been done a lot better"
3,Cheap Fun,"Fans of Clive Owen and Julia Roberts are gonna end up watching this film no matter what anyone says in reviews... like I did. I don't care that the movie was weak on plot, which it was, or that the characters seem to jump in and out of their established roles, which they do. I just wanted to watch these two do their romantic-comedy-spy movie mash-up. And for me it worked well enough.We never really understand why stuff is happening and the ending is far fetched, but fun), but the movie is all about the interplay between Roberts and Owen. It was OK for a cheap rental for date night."
2,"Big, big mistake....huge!","There was a twist in the ending? I must have slept through it. As I did off and on throughout this lackluster movie. Appealing leads, but story was somehow muddled and uninteresting. Flat and boring, actually. The film didn't do well at the box office and now I can understand why. If you like Julia Roberts, watch Pretty Woman again."
2,I'd have to call it a waste of time.,"I'm with the negative reviews on this one. It keeps moving and the actors and scenery are attractive,but it doesn't add up to much. Maltin calls it a ""shaggy dog story,"" and Roger Ebert did like the acting whileadmitting that the plot is confusing - he said that even at the end, he wasn't sure that he understood everything.We recorded it from TV, then erased it. I'd suggest renting it. No way would I want to see this film again. My wife and I watched it over a 3 evening period, and finally just wanted to see how it ended, while hoping that it would indeed end sometime."
3,Corporate Espionage Run Amok,"""Duplicity"" is a movie about corporate espionage, layered with what the viewer believes are double-crosses between two amorously involved spies.The story is told in flashbacks and thus is quite difficult to follow. Julia Roberts and Clive Owens are spies representing different countries who meet, fall in love and engage in a long and elaborate plan to bilk a corporation out of billions of dollars. There is an arrogant attitude imbedded in all this plotting: the assumption that they are far smarter than any corporate security organization and they never doubt their own capabilities.There is a lack of chemistry between the two that makes their plans hollow. They do not seem credible or sympathetic and the flashback storyline further adds to making them remote.Paul Giamatti plays one of the corporate chieftains and he dominates the screen, he grabs our interest.This is an okay film, pleasant enough but not memorable."
1,Really terrible film,"This film is awful. There is zero chemistry between Clive and Julia, the plot is poorly done, and at the end you are just left thinking, ""and what was the point of all that?""The movie is crap."
1,Shabby,"The packaging of the DVD, is very cheap. Also my Bonus features did not play.This was like something you would pick-up off the the $5.00 sale rack, in a supermarket."
1,"Waste of time, money and effort","Such a bad movie! This movie is proof that two A-List stars don't always make a great movie together.This movie is bad. It's painful to watch. I guarantee your apathy towards the movie will increase as the movie drags forward.And Julia Roberts!?!?!? What happened with her!?!?!? It looks as if the makeup crew went out of their way to make her very unattractive. She looked more like a stereotypical menopausal aunt than Julia Roberts. I commend her desire to have no plastic surgery, but yikes! I kept wondering what happened to her ""girl next door"" good looks she had in ""Notting Hill."" Those days are gone. Time can be a cruel, inescapable enemy.I am posting this review as a warning to all consumers: times are tough for most people these days, please spend your money on anything except this movie."
1,Too bad it's so bad,"I'm not going to waste time writing my own review - I'll just quote some others that I agree with -""This movie plot meanders around with flashbacks and forwards so much you don't know if you are coming or going.""""let's see how complex and unrealistic a plot we can flash forward/backward enough to create puzzlement in an attempt to show ""clever"" but which ends up being needlessly confusing. So pointless was this story""""the plot is completely lost with all of the back and forth in the timeline, and shockingly there is little if any chemistry between the two leading characters"""
1,Only Surprise is the Ending,"One expects a lot more from actors such as these. This movie plot meanders around with flashbacks and forwards so much you don't know if you are coming or going. Very little chemistry here except for a proposed formula that is a secret until the end of the movie. Ending has a surprise but little fireworks by way of excitement, and then totally fizzles."
2,Unmemorable,"I can hardly remember it. Good looking people though I don't understand Owen's appeal beyond his looks. It's interesting he is now Hollywood buff where he was once British puny. Roberts is luminous as always but cold somehow, though that may be co-star issues. Just so so really."
3,Julia Robersts Movie,"This movie as OK, nothing special for Julia Roberts talent. Who i have gone to the Movie house, no although the DVD was a good value."
3,"Well, It's okay","I watched it reluctantly and in desperation after watching Millennium Trilogy 50 times each. The film bombed at the box office. The story was complicated enough to be interesting, but the lead characters, or at least the portrayal of them, were very unlikable which turns me off right away. I need to like the characters, no matter how mean or nasty they are, and I could not like these two, especially the Julia Roberts character. That said, if you like'd Michael Clayton sort of story, you'll like this."
3,"Good Acting, Stupid Film","Clive Owen and Julia Roberts carry this film. They deliver some fine dialogue with style and wit, but the plot of the film makes no sense. The screenwriter and director are too cute by half. The flashbacks do become annoying and are not as clever as the director would like us to believe.The biggest problem is the couple steal a formula and offer it to Swiss businessmen. The Swiss company tests it and discovers it's fake. Meanwhile, an American corporate CEO is announcing this great find. Duh. The American company would obviously test this formula too and find out it's phony. There are other problems with the script that other critics have pointed out. The film, while witty and well-made, is a house of cards. The plot doesn't stand up under scrutiny."
2,No chemistry & too slow,"This could have been a good movie, but in my book there was no chemistry between Roberts & Owen, and the pacing was very slow. They tried to apply an Ocean's 11 type slickness, but the relationship itself could have been an interesting story if it was handled with more emotion. I liked the moving back and forth in time, but it was obvious there was a twist so that element lacked surprise. One of the bigger problems in this movie is that Julia Roberts' character is sophisticated and restrained, but in movies where I like her she is very emotional and the opposite of restrained!"
2,conspiracy backfires,"I like both Clive Owen and Julia roberts, but this has got to be one of the worst movies for both of them, it is entertaining to be sure, but pulled by the hairs and spitting on himself Paul Giamatti and his sophisticated high tech goons are a disgrace to what could have been a neat scenario."
2,So much potential...,"...and absolutely nothing to do with this movie. This was supposed to be a SLICK (am I saying this LOUD ENOUGH to the directo?) mouse-chasing-its-tail kind of movie. Instead, Julia Roberts falls in love. Instead, Clive is filled with doubt. Results: both are obviously suckered by the very people that hired them. From the very beginning, you can see that money is NOT the root of all evil; it's not even sex (though that's where the blame is being leveled). It's the idle mind; too bad neither character learned to think like the devil. If you don't trust anyone, you better trust yourself."
1,Very poorly done!,"I was quite happy at the thought of Clive Owen & Julia Roberts teaming up together, but even their star power couldn't make me watch this again! This movie could have been really well done as the theme seems interesting enough, however it was SLOW going!! The movie also went back & forth from present day to their past so many times that it got irritating! I think watching commercials on the tv would have been better! I'm not usually this harsh because I love all sorts of movies! If your wanting a fast paced drama, a hot romance, & a clever plot, this movie is not for you!"
2,Kept watching the time remaining,"Tedious from start to finish. The whole premise was weak and the chemistry non-existent between the two main characters (which considering ""Closer"" I was almost sure they would do well here). Plus whomever did Julia's make up should be fired. Clive looked better than she did (and at least delivered a serviceable performance in spite of the script)."
2,Waste of time,I saw this on an airplane where I am so bored I watch anything.I loved the stars so I had high hopes. The movie went on forever and finally you didn't care who was fooling who.I felt they had no chemistry and the dialogue bordered on silly.Waste of my time.
2,"Good idea, bad implementation","The idea for the story is good, but the actual implementation is not that great. It's a good spy story, with lots of twists and turns, and the mixing of present/past slowly reveals more details about what's happening. However, the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Julia Robert's character seems very flat and there is no chemistry between her and Clive Owen. I had just seen Clive Owen in ""The International"" and he was much better in that movie. Paul Giamatti's portrayal of a crazy CEO that's willing to do anything to crush his competitor was actually one of the only highlights. Overall, I was disappointed."
4,Whimsical twisty spy movie,This was a lot of fluff but it was fun. Nice chemistry between the 2 leads. I am writing this 3 weeks later after seeing the movie and can't say I remember much but it was enjoyable
2,Didn't click,"Characters weren't right for each other, bad casting. But the story line fell apart, lots of holes so the combination was bad from that angle too. It added up to a two star rating for me. And the plot was all too formula, boring. I passed it onto the book sale racks at our local library."
1,Right Price,"This item was already broken when I received it. If you're looking for something that's durable, look elsewhere."
2,Dissapointed,"I was pleased with the appearance, however, the fastener on the chain does not stay tight on my glasses. After they fell off the second time.. I threw it in a drawer. I was very disappointed in this product."
2,Cheap,I found this to short for my purposes and the chain gets caught in my hair. I wouldn't have purchased it if I could have seen it before hand.
1,Eyeglass holder,This broke the moment I tried to put my glasses on it also very light in weight would have been comfy able if it hadn't broke
1,Not a nice chain,"A chain this size, when you are not using it for your glasses, can be used to tie up your car, can be used for keeping fences closed, or any other thing that requires a big, fat, wide,ostentatious chain."
2,Style that fails,"I bought these for my mother in law, since she reads alot, but always misplaces her reading glasses, they looked nice, but it only took a couple of days before they broke, cheaply made."
2,Dont use on wood floors.,Not good for your wood floors. Darkened my wood floors b/c dirt sticks to the oil and fills in all the little cracks and scratch's. Now scratches are more noticeable.
2,Not really very exceptional,"This is basically average 70's rural bar band rock that is strongly influenced by The Allman Brothers. Granted, it features some rock solid lead guitar playing, but the problem here is that the songwriting is just not that great. There are a couple of good songs I guess, but the rest is pretty forgettable stuff. To sum it up, there were thousands of bands just like this playing in bars all over the country in the 70's. The mastering is pretty lousy, and the CD clocks in at around 25 minutes as well. Cool cover though."
5,His 3rd recording --- a must have,This is his 3rd recording in his career. This puertorican singer has a lot to offer and this recording is one of his best. Best song in this CD is Locos de Amor.
4,anyone know what's on this cd?,I can't find any information on the web. (Discount my 4-star rating. I might purchase it but only if I can get some info about the contents. I have no idea how many stars it should get.)
1,$76.08???,$76.08??? Seriously??? I love Ms. Nicks... but $76.08??? I couldn't possibly afford it.Just who is being so greedy here?
3,Stevie Nicks-Soundstage,"Overrated. Mostly her own song-writings, with nothing truly standing out, or comparable to Fleetwood Mac songs."
1,Dissapointed,"The jacket is wrinkled as if it were once wet. Some letters are written on the label side of the disc with a magic marker. I would not say this item is in a ""very good"" condition."
5,Awesome!,Lots of good tips for this style of guitar playing! looking forward to Part 2.Bought used. the booklet was not included as it should have been. Contacted the manufacturer they emailed it back to me in PDF. No questions asked.Very happy.
3,Good but missing a song,"This album is very original. A concept that Tito wanted to bring to reality. It is a good album, however, it is missing a song, ""Si usted me Quiere"". It is a spanish/english song with Tito Puente playing the vibes. Great romantic salsa."
5,Changed my life,"This book had a significant impact on who I am today: a more self confident person who understands that the only person truly in control of my life is: ME!I love the examples of how to handle conflict situations, as for those of us who grew up without a good example, knowing that we don't deal with situations appropriately is not so helpful if we don't get clues on how to improve.A friend recommended the book and I have given it to friends since. Read this book if you are not afraid of change, as change is required. Change to be a happier person.I have read a lot of psychology books, this one is right to the point and spoke my language. It gave me hope and the tools to make my life better."
5,can't say enough,this book really explained the dance that everyone does in relationships..thought it was interesting to learn that what people complain about in relationships is really what they don't want changed and if it were changed they might try to get it to change back...appreciated this author's approach..highly recommend
4,Wow. Not about anger and more about positioning,"This book provided real insight into the push-versus-pull, nurturer-versus-taker, pursuer-versus-pursuee relationship dynamics and how a man or a woman contributes to these types of dynamics. The author tells it through a series of chapter vignettes on different couples and their relationships. Furthermore, the author gives a meaningful methodology on how to modify one's contribution if you want to modify a specific relationship pattern."
1,Book was not useful to those who have examined their life..,"If you have already examined your life through any type of therapy, this book is not for you. I found the information to be very basic - geared toward people who have no self-esteem, or voice. The basic premise is to take responsiblity for your anger, and to be assertive."
3,A little too black and white for me,"I found it hard to read this book without shaking my head, critiquing it, and just not relating to it. There were some helpful pearls, but I didn't agree that the issue women have with anger is so black and white. Maybe better for an older generation who related to relationships in a different way. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."
3,so-so,was just a bunch of stories and told me nothing I didn't know already. It was okay as a one time read but not something you can read over and over. Might be good for some but I wasn't impressed.
3,Dancing Away,"This book had some stories that were interesting about relationships, but some of them seemed to get out of the 'anger' theme. Well, the main theme is that there is a dance, namely a pattern in anger in relationships and that usually serves to cover other hidden issues. The book gets kind of syrupy sometimes and that is why the 3 stars."
4,Dance of Anger,"I was floored by my husband asking to see a therapist/psychiatrist for counseling. After 2 sessions, he decided to ask for a divorce. I was devastated.The therapist suggested this book to me and continued counseling with just me. It helps. It isn't perfect, but it is a start toward healing."
4,Highly Recommended,I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to end the bickering. You know ... you argue about the same thing and no one ever wins - you just wind up shutting down and angrier than before. The author offers practical advice and lots of examples that anyone can relate to.
5,dance of intimacy,This book was very intersting and helped me to better understand relationships in a whole new different aspect. This was one of the best most informative books that I've read recently. Two thumbs up for me!
4,Very Insightful and Provocative,My counselor recommended this book to me when I was going through a separation and divorce. I recently bought this book as a gift for a friend who is going through a difficult time. Lerner's experience and insights are very helpful. The concepts presented are provocative in that it will make the reader think about how their family of origin's relationship dynamic can often be seen reflected in the present. A must read for anyone wondering why they keep making the same choices in partners and how to break the cycle.
4,This book helped me in my relationships,"I have had problems in the past with rage, now that rage has become anger. This book will help you get in touch with your anger, and use it in constructive ways"
4,good book,"We can all use a little help recognizing, accepting, and managing our anger in healthy ways. This book helps you do that. 4 stras because it was more a read for knowledge than a book I couldn't put down or couldn't wait to share."
5,Patterns is the key word,"This book is wonderful. It would be helpful to anyone - men and women alike when have just about any type of relationship problem. She is great about explaining that our relationships - when they are not at an optimal level get stuck in a pattern. Like an overfunctioning parent results in an underfunctioning child...hit home on that one. It isn't an anger management book, really - more that when you feel some anxiety in a relationship - it can be due to anger but more importantly a bad pattern of behavior. Even better, she gives examples of how to begin to ""break"" the pattern - or how she says ""Dance"" - you move differently and the dance changes! Great book - helpful for work issues, marital issues, and child rearing. Notes that unresolved issues with first family replay themselves in the family we make for ourself. You will not regret reading this book - written in such a way that is easy to read."
2,Too wordy,I'm about halfway done with the book but I must say I've lost interest. There is so much wordiness. The real-life stories/examples the author shares are way too long and repetitive. I wish it was more concise and to the point.
2,"It has some good points, but overall...",The life situations she uses don't match up to real life dilemma. Will look for something more realistic. Keep looking.
5,Insightful,"sometimes it's hard to look at the man/woman in the mirror, when you're ready to, read this book but make sure you're able to make the necessary changes which accompany the emotional insight."
4,ok,Bought the book and read most of it. Some really informative info and such. Not quite what I needed at the time
5,Learn to let go.,"I have been recommending this book to my astrology clients and people who take my Creative Living class for years. It helps its readers to focus on how to change difficult patterns relational patterns--which we all know is not easy. Readers feel the kindness and compassion of the author as well as her expertise throughout the book.Joyce Levine, author of A Beginner's Guide to Astrological Interpretation, Breakthrough Astrology, Healing Anger and Resentment."
3,Casca#22: the Mongol,"After spending 10 years in collecting the entire series of Casca books I was very eager to read about The Mongol which was the last but one I collected. Being something of a history nut I knew a fair bit about the history of Genghis Khan and found little in Barry Sadler's story that didn't sound true. I was however a little disappointed in the way the story seemed to tail off and die. It was as though Sadler got a point in the story and thought 'gee, better finish this quick as its getting a bit long'. That aside the story told well the formative part of Genghis' rise to power - I particularly liked Casca's ""Conan the Barbarian"" role as the chained beast at the beginning. I was a bit puzzled at the character of Qubilai - surely he was Genghis' grandson and never saw Genghis alive? No matter, the story was well written and was typical Sadler, action, adventure and mayhem. Sadler will be missed."
4,Good historical/action fiction,"In this story Casca wanders to the Mongolian plains in the late 1100's to meet up with a young tribesman who will someday be known as Ghengis Kahn, leader of all Mongols. He takes this young kid and teaches him the skills that only someone with over a thousand years of experience could, how to fight, lead men, and wage war.The Khan character was well developed. I actually did some research on Ghengis Kahn after I got done reading this book and found Sadlers research pretty sound. He did change some of the names of the key historical figures though, but I couldn't figure out what the reason for that was.It is too bad we can't ask him. I'm sure he'd have a good reason behind it."
4,Looks awesome in basement Hawkeye bathroom!,I really like the looks of curtain and seems like good shower curtain. Only problem is if you don't get a colored liner then you can see through it. After getting rid of the clear liner and putting a colored one it's fine. Love it!
5,Halt the comparisons for a while and listen to this jewel,"YES - this band has been highly influenced by My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth, Lush ... and so the list goes on. The Beatles were influenced by Roy Orbison and Bud Holly, so what!? Does that make the band worse!? - I recommend everyone to just buy this album and listen to it carefully. This is an extremely well done piece of art that surely deserves my respect."
4,GO SEE THE LIVE SHOW!!!,"This is a great album. See other reviews for a rehash.BUT if you ever get a chance to see this band live...YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST. It is the most amazing experience. Orgasmic. Heavenly. I don't know why, but the way the album is mixed doesn't reflect the evil, crunchy, powerful sounds that come out of the live show. I've seen many, many concerts and theirs rates in my top 10 of all time. In DC, I can tell you they play at clubs like 9:30 and Black Cat. Unfortuntely, I didn't see a space on their webpage that listed upcoming shows. But you should really check out your local indie clubs to see if Autolux is coming."
2,Beware! Ingredients listed on Amazon are not the same ingredients for pictured item,"I ordered this based on the ingredients listed on the Amazon page. These ingredients are for the OLD formulation. The new formulation (which *is* correctly pictured here) has the following ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cyclomethicone, Polysorbate 80, Sorbitan Oleate, Silica Silylate, Ester-C Calcium Ascorbate, Ester C Sorbitol (and) Glycerine (and) Calcium Ascorbate, Polysorbate 20, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Distearate, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vit. E), Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Benzyl Alcohol, Natural Menthol, Natural Vanilla Flavor, Fragrance.I am returning this item because I wanted to try the older, better formulation."
5,Aromatherapy on Top of it All,"I'm not observant enough to know how much it helps my skin, but the scent always makes me feel relaxed and glad that I used it. I'm on my third bottle."
3,2.5 mm to 3.5mm adaptor,"It works fine for me calling someone else, but when someone else calls me, I can answer the phone and hear the other person, but they can't hear me answer them, so as far as answering the phone w/them, they are useless. They sound great on my laptop listening to music and on my MDA, but answering the phone, not great at all."
1,Did not work with Samsung m500,The adapter did not work when plugged in to a samsung m500. The sound only came out of one ear when plugged in.
3,2.5mm Male to 3.5mm Female Adapter,"The description was unclear and we purchased this item thinking that it was a 2.5 female to 3.5 male adapter. This company is based in China and is hard to contact. When you send an email, you get a different person ever time with a different response to the same question each time."
1,Stereo vs Mono,"You will see on other adapters there are four contacts on the male connector. These have three contacts. My phone reacted with mono sound when using a connector convert like this. The difference must be the common ground that both channels share when using a three contact set up. Maybe some phones use the three contact like the Treo someone else is talking about. My blackberry pearl didn't like it. I just bought the actual cell phone head phones, they have four contacts and I get stereo."
2,"Good Idea, but needs fixed","Whoever made this product, has a good product, but using stereo headphones will only produce sound through one side. (i use apple ipod headphones)Sent it back, thinking it was a flaw and got another pair with same problem. Would buy if you have the right type of headphones or don't mind listening to music on only one side"
2,Connection is too loose,"I would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort. The 2.5 mm jack is slightly too small, creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active. I tried both adapters (i bought the 2-pack) in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose. In positive news, the connection at the 3.5 mm end is nicely snug."
3,Revival not as good as Cassidy Bros,"I just purchased the London Revival Cast Recording of ""Blood Brothers"" after seeing it in London in 2000. I previously owned the Cassidy Bros/Petulla Clark recording. That recording far surpasses this one in quality of voices/interpretation, etc. Kiki Dee sounds flat and unemotional whereas Ms. Clark is a believable mom torn by tragic events of her life. I am very sorry I purchased this other, boring recording- even Willy Russell doesn't capture the intensity found on the other recording -I'll have to repurchase the Cassidy Bros. (they were surprisingly great - I wasn't a fan before that) one which is hands down the best - I miss it and the mood it inspired."
3,Its OK,"This musical is nothing special. I own two different recordings of it, and this is the better of the two. The lyrics in the show are nice although plain. The accents in this recording arent the best, but they seem to be what people mimic. The orchestration of this show is very nice, and its worth the listen. As far as songs, the narrator sings the most, and hes definitly the part to play. Favorite Song: ""I'm Not Saying a Word"""
5,Waited way too long!!,I first heard selections from this cd on accubroadway.com. Kiki Dee is amazing as the mother. The story is heartbreaking. Even my hormonal eleven year old son goes around the house singing songs from this cd!!!
2,Just for archieve,"This is just an archiever's item,only got 5 video clips on it!I just recommend it to cranberries fans,not for the new listeners.It would be better to buy stars:best of dvd instead of this dvd.Not worth money."
3,Little Dissapointed,"I Was So Excited For This To Come In The Mail! The Only Problem I Have With This Is The Material.It Attracts Lint Fast, Especially The Black Bags. I Find Myself Grabbing The Lint Roller Every 5 Minutes.I Thought It Would Be A Bit Nicer For The Price."
4,Decent bag,"This is a nice bag. I got it for school, but it is a little big. I put 2 books and a binder in it and it still seems a little big, but maybe it's just me."
3,Message missing,Good product well described BUT description didnot say made in China. I needed to know that.
4,"Great for college, but...","This bag has lasted me for 2+ semesters of college. It is very roomy and holds my laptop (13 in. MacBook Pro, which the magnetic clasps have zero effect on it), 1 good sized textbook, and multiple single-subject notebooks all without looking too deformed.The downside to this is, I may have opened it the wrong way one day (I'm not sure) but one of the magnets almost ripped off completely. I have been able to keep it attached with hot glue, but I have to re-apply that every now and then."
4,Nice Bag,"My bag just arrived today. I bought mine in the color black. I couldn't believe the amount of space inside this bag! The soft material is very lightweight which keeps the shoulder strap from tugging on my shoulder (Unlike my old messenger bag which was a thicker sturdy material but was really heavy on the shoulder, especially when carrying contents inside). The downside of this bag being lightweight material is that it doesn't stand up on it's own when you put it down. You have to lean it against something or lay it down. But who cares. It has two zipper compartments inside, one small and the other large. Also, it has slim cellphone/cigarette pockets ON BOTH ENDS OF THE BAG. Now that's cool. Overall, I'm happy with it."
4,"It works, but it's not the best","The canvas bag is a little too floppy, and too wide. It curls around my body when I wear it over my shoulder, but it isn't horrible. The zipper pokets on the inside are a little small also."
5,great messenger bag,I got this messenger bag for my husband and he loves it. It is roomy enough for him to fit everything that he needs and the fabric is very durable. I was very happy with this purchase.
4,Very usefull bag,"I got this manbag for my husband's birthday, and it was just what he want it, perfect size, not to big.Just one thing, it wasn't dyed raw edge at all, actually it was complety black, it's good though."
1,Bad sound quality since day one,"This phone always had a strange ""hum"" when using the handset. However, lately, it also has a lot (and I mean a LOT) of static on the line. Other phones in the house don't have this problem. I reset the power to the phone but the problem is still there. I'm now forced to replace the phone."
2,Victorian prejudice,"This book contains tiresome characters in an anti-catholic setting. For a Wilkie Collins book, it is absolutely dreadful. Still, it is a Collins book, so at least it is well written. A man and woman marry. A Jesuit, out to get the man's property, breaks up the marriage and succeeds in making everyone miserable, including the reader. While I had heard of the prejudice against Jews and Catholics in Victorian England, it never hit home until I read this book."
5,Now that's more like it.,"Yesterday I wrote a review about the cd tittled Time shifter by Mr. Hidalgo. Today I listened to Worldwide and this cd is everything the other one wasn't. Great music reminiscent of Cal Tjader, and the congas, Wao! Listen to track five for a great conga solo. Time shifter is not bad, just not what I expected. I still would like to hear Mr. Hidalgo doing an all out latin cd. I have heard him playing as a guest with salsa bands but not a whole album. It would be great."
5,Heavenly singing by a real jazzed angel!!!,"Ethel Waters had the most beautiful voice ever, when she sang the angels danced in heaven. I mean this woman's phrasing was completely jazzy, yet her voice was pure and sweet. Always a dicty singer, at times very white sounding, and theb the next minute she's be scattin' away, but always in high browl sophistocated style. This CD has her mostly singing the blues of the ""20's blues craze"", with just James P. Johnson, King of the stride piano(the CD would be worth picking up alone for James P. Johnson's piano playing). There are also a few soon to be jazz standards here ""Heebie Jeebies"" and the classic ""Sugar"" as well as the classic blues ""Loud Speakin' Papa."" This is the difinitive 20's Ethel Waters CD."
4,Talk about phrasing,"Ethel waters enuctuation and phrasing are excellant. If you like early Billie Holiday you will love her forerunner and arch enemy Ethel Waters. For her time she had such perfect timing and phrasing and each word is clear and precise though at times she tends to veer in the vaudevillian opretic style that was prevelant in her day. This is a good ""old testemant to anyone considering to be a singer phrasing and enuuation is what makes a singer last! A great CD!"
4,great side table,"This is a great side table. It was fairly easy to put together, although I received some faulty pieces which were replaced by the seller when I contacted them. I use it outdoors and it looks very nice."
2,"Poor quality, couldn't put it together","I love the look and the idea but mine was so poorly made that we couldn't even put it together. Holes weren't drilled in the right spots (or in one case, not at all). My husband is pretty handy and set out to try to get it put together even though he had to do some drilling but it ended up not being square and it was wobbly. The company was good about refunding my money though and I didn't even have to send the table back (although it just ended up in the trash)."
4,Glass top sofa table,"I likethis table. It is solid enough to hold a reading lamp , a full size book and acup of coffee with comfort androom to spare.. aThe glass top is solis and heavy and so are the supports. I assembled it in less than ten minutrd."
2,So Disappointing,"The title of this book ""The Little Book of Judas"" fooled me-I was expecting some real enlightening poems about Judas Iscariot/betrayal instead the poems are angry and some contain profanties. Take for instance the poem: ""A Lamblasting"" (page 79; 4th stanza):'Finally' he rasped as he downed more wine,'You're the prison bully and you're hangman-smelly.And that, Judas, is [BEEP] that!'Profanities take the classiness out of a good poem.I think this book of poems by Brendan Kennelly is a little too hard on the palate and consequently does not satisfy the soul. Since purchasing this book, I have chewed and swallowed it but my system is having a some difficulty digesting it.One star for the effort and another for the beautiful cover showing ""details from Giotto's Betrayal of Christ (1303-1305), with Christ holding The Book of Judas, from a 12th century Byzantine mosaic""."
2,I purchased the first starter kit by Pelican,"The one that included a travel case, 4 disc jackets, screen guard, car charger, USB data cable and a polish cloth anyway I didn't much care for it. The USB cable is too short to comfortably put the PSP on the desk while transferring files. The cable is only about 2 feet long so its only long enough to sit on top of the PC which isn't too safe because it could fall. The car charger is cheap because earlier today the thing burned out and when I noticed it the thing was very hot to touch. I had to pull it out of the dc outlet with a napkin! I'm starting to question Pelicans accessories especially since the recall of the power brick now this. On to other things the case holds 4 UMD's with the jackets on, but the two that go in the flap part of the case puts pressure on the PSP screen which over time probably could damage it."
1,BS,I bought this product for one reason and one reason alone and it was for the thumb piece that the picture displays! When I got the package in I was shocked that it didn't come with the thumb piece! I don't mind the car charger but come on. Can we say FALSE ADVERTISEMENT????????
1,it is hhhhhhhhhhoooooooooorrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiibbbllllllllleeeeeeeee,it is a horrible product and is not worth it. It is a good product though. depends on you it is not excellent quality.
5,A book that drew me in.,"This book is in a coffee shop down the street from where I live. I picked it up to look at as I relaxed over a cup of coffee. I was soon drawn in. Each lodge has its own story . . . the author, Christina Barnes' way of presenting facts & information about how each happened, the landscape, the architect, the architecture & all makes me want to personally visit them all. The only one I've been to is The Ahwahnee of Yosemitie Nationial Park. Not as an overnight guest, but after an outdoors photo class I stopped in to have a cup of coffee in the dining room. That was 15 years ago & the memory of the outside & inside, relaxing over a cup of coffee in the dining room, are still strong in my memory. A grand lodge that somehow fits perfectly inside a park with awsome, powerful natural beauty."
3,"George Shearing ""Breakin' Out""",This is an older release by Shearing. It has a sort of '80s sound to it but it nonetheless is a very listenable record.
1,Cheaply made item: bottom ripped out on the first day of use,I bought 3 of these for my family to take to the beach. Two of them ripped on the bottom after children's clothes and a normal sized bath towel were placed inside.
2,Doesn't hold up well....,"I had bought this same bag for my older son last year to carry his wrestling equipment. He STILL has his bag, which is the same except that it is a different color. His has NEVER given us any problems. Therefore, I ordered the same bag for my younger son for the same purpose. Within its first week of use, the seem was split, requiring me to sew it back. Now the zipper on the front pocket is torn and there is another hole where the strap is sewn to the bag itself. I am disappointed that it hasn't held up as well as the other one we purchased. The bag itself is a nice size and I like that it is mesh, allowing for the wrestling equipment being able to be ""aired"" out....I just wish it held up as good as the first one I purchased."
1,Fell apart,"I got this to carry toiletries to and from the latrines. I only carried a couple of travel sized bottles, a towel and my sonicare toothbrush travel case in it. It only took a couple of weeks before the bottom started unraveling. I used it until the hole was big enough for the travel bottles to slip through. I ended up buying a larger Speedo version with a little less mesh (more privacy) and thicker shoulder straps. The second bag is much better than this one."
2,The zippered pouch isn't very sturdy,"Updating my review to 2 stars. The seams on the bottom of the bag have now come open, and I still haven't used it that much in the 2 years I've had it. My advice: spend a little extra and get a bag that's made to last.I've used this bag only a little in the 2 years I've had it. A few trips to the gym -- wish I'd made more! But even with light use, the zippered pouch has come unstitched. This isn't too surprising... they sewed it onto the mesh, so there's 50% less contact area for the thread.Anyway... I'm not wild about this bag, but at least it's affordable."
2,Can't handle a 9 year old boy,"this certainly falls under the catergory of you get what you pay for. my son used it for two days, by the third day, i guess he pulled too hard and the bottom part of where the straps connect to the bag, a hole was created. the seams are not sewn tight enough or the mesh is too big. either way, i was quite annoyed that the bag was used only twice and it was not worth my time or effort to return. in addition, they certainly took their sweet time in picking it and mailing it to us."
5,AWESOME SWIMMING BAG!!,Well this product is simply wonderful.Lots of space and separate pocket to keep your products organized.Fast shipping and awesome deal.
5,Perfect !!,This bag is perfect for smelly/stinky athletic clothes ! We love the bag and will purchase more in different colors !!Thanks
3,Good value,"I purchased this backpack for work because we have a clearbag policy. I would have rated it higher, but the zipper on the pocket keeps jamming. Otherwise I am very happy with my purchase."
1,not strong enough.,"If you have small kids that do not have heavy books or just want to carry toys in this, then this would be good.My daughter took it to school and it ripped on the first day with a couple of high school books in it. Not for heavy duty."
4,backpack review,"So far so good. School books can really put a strain on these bags, so we'll see how long it holds up. It looks really sturdy and durable."
1,Just don't buy this!,"The bag seemed good at first, but after less than a week. It started to fall apart. The strings fall off, holes opened up near the bottom. And I didn't put anything heavy in there... Just two small hand towels, jump rope, hand chalk, and a light knee brace. Just pay a little more and get a better bag."
3,okay for the price,"this bag is kinda low quality. the strings aren't like ""standard string bags"" and is really just a loose draw string. I purchased this as a gym shower bag, and am sure it will do the job."
1,Bad Bag,Bag was nice when first recieved however it only lasted about 2 weeks. Bag started to rip at the bottom of the bag. My wife quit using it because she thought she would lose something out of it.
1,straps tore after two days,"Used two of these on a recent trip to Hawaii. Neither was overloaded; just regular beach stuff; compact towel, sunscreen sunglasses, iphone, etc. One strap held by a thread after one day. That thread broke on day 2. Other bag had both straps hanging by a thread on second day of use. Junk."
2,mesh bag review,The ordering process was great and the delivery timing was amazing but I've had it a month carrying small items that I need for work and the bag has already started to rip. I bought it because I thought it looked sturdy enough to hold a few things. I have to buy another bag now.
5,"Strong, well-made bag!","The bag arrived in great shape and is really a quality product, despite being made in China. I'm using it to store my winter hats, gloves, etc. in the car so I can see through the mesh to see what's there."
2,not good for books,"This bag may be great for lighter loads, but not good for school books. One of the seams tore apart the first day my son used it."
2,"bought to use for pool, beware the zipper",Bought two of these for my stepkids to use for the pool. Zipper on front of each broke before they even made it out of the house. I was the one using the zippers so it wasn't do to the kids being rough with it. Otherwise bags held up ok for frequent water park and pool excursions this summer. Buying tote bags from LL Bean or Lands End for next year.
1,Don't order this item,"I ordered this backpack for my daughter to meet her schools mesh or clear backpack requirement. This bag started falling apart on day 4 of school! As a 2nd grader, there was very little weight in the bag during its 4 day lifespan so I know it was not due to the load it carried. Also, it was not easy to open and close. I would not recommend this backpack to anyone regardless of intended use. It is not worth it."
4,Smaller than expected,"I just got this bag and the construction seems good. Will have to give another update on durability down the line. Good minimalist bag. But, it was much smaller than i expected. I was hoping it could hold my boxing gloves and my shin guards. Sadly it can only hold my 16oz sparring gloves and hand wraps, with little room for anything else.That said, it would make a great gym bag, but not a gear bag."
3,Didn't hold up well,"I bought two of these for my kids to use for carrying swim clothes to and from summer camp daily. I love the way the top closes, love the zipper pocket, and love that it's mesh (that's why I bought it), but on both bags, within two weeks, the straps ripped away from the bottom of the bag, requiring me to safety pin them until I found the time to actually sew them back on. I was so disappinted! Now that I have sewed all four straps back on (two on each bag), I like them again, but it seems ridiculous that they started coming apart so quickly!"
2,Did not hold up,"After one month of use, the bag started to rip by the straps. We were using it to carry pool toys that were not heavy. I would not recommend this bag unless you are going to carry very light items."
4,Adorable Book for Adults,"The negative reviews are absolutely right. This is a sermon to adults to read to their children. It's still a beautiful book that brought a tear to my eye. The message is to read to your children. If you might be annoyed at this message, don't buy the book, but if you like that message, it says it beautifully."
4,Nice Shower/New Mom Gift and Early Rhythmic Reader,"This book is really more of a cute little reminder to new parents about the importance of reading to their children. There's really no story, and yet it's somehow endearing. I can't say it would hold the attention of a child much older than 3 who is actually following a story. But for an infant (to whom it is important to read, too!), it provides a nice engaging rhythm and rhyme. My two year old was even still engaged with the pictures of the cute little bunny and the cadence and poetry.Very nice gift for a new parent."
1,Read to Your Bunny Board Book,I read in the book review section of the local paper that this book was a must-have for all young children. I am well versed in children's literature and this book is horrible. It is strictly a little incentive book for parents to read to their children to help in their development. A child would be bored with it.
2,Read to Your Bunny,I thought this would be a nice book for a baby gift but it was really too preachy and aimed at parents not children. I returned the book.
1,My Bunny hated this book,This book was terrible. Didn't hold either of my son's attention. Barely held mine.
3,"Manie, a family book","The Mandie series take me back to the days of ""little house on the prarie"". It is a saga of a small girl and her friends that help her solve minor mysteries, but it is mainly about her strong family bonds. Great reading for all ages. Make me feel young again."
2,Half hearted,"This mold is too shallow. But if you stick two pieces together, you can get a nice 3-D heart."
5,Valentine's Day Candy Mold,"This was part of the same order I placed for candy molds for a variety of uses and occasions, since it all arrived together and all in good shape there is not much else to say that I have not said already in the previous statements about these molds except now other kids are involved in this process of candy making thinking they can start a company now and I am thinking that it might not be that far out of reality as a few big companies started as kitchen or garage type operations and blossomed from there.."
1,Not available for Kindle,"Contrary to what Amazon indicates when you do a general search for ""dictionary Kindle"" this dictionary cannot be purchased for a Kindle. Nor can any other unabridged dictionary. The Kindle is first and foremost for readers and those who read a lot find comprehensive dictionaries very valuable. In the Kindle users' guide they indicated you can buy and install other dictionaries but no unabridged dictionaries are available. I think it is false advertising. There are some specialized dictionaries, such as medical dictionaries but no general, comprehensive dictionaries."
5,Excellent visual based learning,"This is an excellent book for those who are keen on visual based learning. It is not an adequate substitute for a text or a proper atlas, but it's great for just before the test sorta crammin'. I studied under Whitaker, and he is by far one of the best Anatomical teachers I have ever seen as far as graphically based learning/teaching is concerned. If you're reading this Dr. Whitaker, publish more of the sketches you use during lectures! None of the diagrams actually look directly like their anatomical representatives, but that's irrelevant. The main emphasis is on connections and relationships, as opposed to direct identification. A must have! It's so good that I've already had two copies stolen from me! Obviously, it's a big hit with other students as well..."
1,Do not buy this,I got this adapter a year and half back. Since then it is giving lot of problems to me. First the chord length is small. The insulation was coming off near the joints and I have to tape them all the time. Also the plug doesn't fit into the laptop socket tightly. Hence a small movement in the lap-top the plug falls off. It finally stopped working now.
3,Great if you already have some body knowledge,"This book was one of my mom's rejects for the reason that she couldn't make head nor tail of the instructions. I like it quite a bit, but I have a background in modern dance and was already familiar with isolating different muscle groups. I think if you don't have a good sense of your body already, this book might be too confusing to start with.So far there's a lot of good material for me to work with, although much of the book is dedicated to repetitive touting of the benefits of pilates (yes, we already know it tones) as well as super-advanced exercises using complicated equipment, which aren't really ""for dummies."" Still, the workouts are fun, challenging, and feel good on my body. I would recommend glancing at the instructions before buying and seeing if they make sense to you. If they do, you'll probably like this book -- otherwise, maybe try a video or simpler book."
5,Great reference,"I have been working out on a reformer for a month, and absolutely love the pilates workout. I was looking to get matwork materials to take on vacation, and am very happy with this book--it seems to provide a sound basis for the matwork. I also highly recommend Pilates for Dummies on video."
2,"I agree completely with the review ""Not really for Dummies""","I couldn't understand the instructions either, for the samereason: You have to read the book while you're trying todo the exercise. However, this ended up giving me a great workout: I was lying on my back for many minutes holding a ""crunch"", since I had to keep my neck raised up trying to read the book while I was supine on the mat. This may be a new Pilates exercise.-Ilan Vardi"
1,Don't Bother w/ Miniature Edition,"Firstly, I love ""For Dummies"" books, but the Miniature Edition of ""Pilates for Dummies"" was a complete waste of money. When I received the book, it was literally about 2 inches long by 2 inches wide, and a paragraph takes up ONE PAGE of this ""book"", making it nearly impossible to read without getting a headache. There are also no illustrations to explain exercises (they really wouldn't fit anyway). DON'T GET the Miniature Edition!"
4,Solid Album,"I first heard these guys open up for Edwin McCain at Amos' South End in Charlotte. I was impressed by their sound, since it was similar to that of Edwin. Their song lyrics are excellent and the music is very enjoyable. The track Better Man is by far my favorite on the CD. Its a good album for the band, one I give three stars. The fourth star comes from the fact that theses guys live sound just like they do on the album, which is always impressive. After this CD, I'm looking forward to future albums from The Steve Williams Band and hope to see them in concert again."
1,never received order,"I ordered a raspberry lip balm from Pin up Balm about 6 weeks ago. I received a note from Amazon about three weeks ago, saying my order had never shipped, and followed up with an email to Pin Up Balm. I was assured that my lip balm was being shipped that day, but that I was going to be given a refund because of the delay. It is now 6 weeks since I ordered the product and I have neither received the lip balm, a refund, or any other response from the additional two emails I have sent to Pin Up Balm trying to sort things out.Don't order from this vendor unless you enjoy throwing your money away for nothing!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"My 3 month old loves her Baby Einstein videos. When I saw this in the store I thought that it looked cute, so I bought it for her thinking she would like something different. I put it in for her, and it did not hold her attention for one second. I thought that maybe it would be better if she were older, so I let a friend borrow it. She has a 5 month old son, and he actually cried when the puppets came on!Save your money and stick with what works. In our case, we will stick with Baby Einstein."
5,Stroke of Genius,"I can only say the same with the other title Baby Moves. The video got my first baby boy's attention he can't get his eyes off it. I can play it in the car, on the portable DVD player whenever and wherever I can/need to calm him down. Now that he's 3 years old, he still watches it with his baby brother and same effect happens. There's some formula in here that just grabs kids' attention. I'm finding myself looking for another copy and here I am writing a review about it."
2,Don't let the DVD name fool you - poor video quality,"This camera uses MPEG-1 compression which is basically VHS quality, not MPEG-2 which is the current DVD standard of choice. Despite high pixel count for still images, MPEG-1 is only 352X240 and it shows. Also, software provided is PC only. Finally, the small (8cm) format discs don't play well in cheaper players. I've had problems where the small disc does not have enough mass to keep the spindle PLL in the player locked so the movie hesitates on playback. Very frustrating. All in all a big disappointment."
2,"Good Camera, No Support!","I have had this camera for about a year. I have used to record sports events, home events, etc. I have been satisfied with the recording capability. I did have to upgrade my home dvd player so that I can use the DVD format. I have been able to transfer movies to my PC for professional editing using third party software from Pinnacle and Dazzle. The software supplied by Panasonic for PC operations does not work, period. I have tried to contact Panasonic for support, and have received absolutely no response, not even an acknowledgement. There is no way I can find to replace or upgrade the software, or to get a human to answer questions. Customer support is crucial to me, I will not buy another Panasonic product given my experience to date."
2,"No problem with picture quality, but...","I used to love this camcorder. Anymore it seems I cannot get through an entire disc without some sort of fatal disc error. I have lost more memories than I care to think about!Right now it keeps giving me error 0280. I have removed the disc several times to no avail. All I want to do is finalize the disc and move on! I guess you have to finalize the disc if you're lucky enough to get one-third or one-half full before you get a disc error.I used to think it was the disc, but I'm really not sure. I have tried Fuji, Memorex and I don't know what else. I am really disppointed and sad about the lost footage. I still have all the corrupt discs. I wish there were some way to retrieve the data as I was never able to finalize them."
2,Don't buy this camera!!!!!,"If you are concerned with picture quality don't buy this camera. This cameras selling feature is that you can record to dvd. Which is does very well. The picture quality is very poor. The color fidelity and saturation is very poor. The detail in the blacks is non existent. If you are like me and tape the kids bithday party's, etc & want any kind of picture quality don't buy this camera. Most of my recording was being done under 3 60 watt light bulbs. Such as in a living room or kitchen. So there's plenty of light to work with. What you are paying for with this camera is the dvd recorder. As others have said the supplied software is useless.At this point I was fed up with the consumer garbage camera's out there so I went out and bought a Canon GL2. This camera Rocks. Email ne if questions. mrrjm@1meg.net"
4,Good Keyboard,"I purchased this specific model because having a built-in touchpad is more comfortable than using a regular mouse, since the mouse is closer to your hands.The upper right corner of the touchpad is the rigth-click button, which is a little annoying sometimes, but I got used to it.I don't like the location of the mouse buttons (on the left).Look for the new model that now comes with the buttons in the lower part."
1,made for thick hair,i thought this product would condition as well as give body no it made my hair limp no good staying with bed head moisture maniac
1,How much for a basic shower item?,Can't believe my wife paid this much for this rubbish ... you can get the same exact item from Publix in a different bottle for a couple of bucks.
2,Ashcatcher,Well it looks nice but wasn't to happy with it's functionality. It is increadibly narrow and doesn't do a good job at catching the ash. Kinda dissapointed.
2,Fresh would be nice,"Like most of what I've read by Gilbert and/or Lynn Morris, the history that can't be learned from a textbook is the almost-redeeming part. I found myself throughout the story thinking something (more) exciting was about to happen, and then, when the predictable occurred, I was disappointed.Before I read ""The Exiles"", it had been a long time since I had read this author. Several years ago, I read an entire series by this duo. After the first two books, the writing came off as repetitive, using the same words in each book to describe the main characters.In my experience, predictable writing such as this is acceptable, for a period. But that acceptability has worn out it's welcome for this reader.To make this review more productive: I'd like to see the authors use their knowledge of US history in stories, but to work more on fresh characters and more plot twists. Readers LIKE the unpredictable."
3,exciting at times,"The book was much better in the begining. By the end of the story things were not very exciting and it was very predictable. It made things that would be a really big deal seem like nothing. I got board of the book and was just ready for it to end. Personally it drug on to long! Even though there was the bad things, it was not a horrible book. I would say people who like old time almost real life stories would like this.If you like lots of excitement and suspence than you will not like this book. It's the type of book that people either like lots or don't really like at all."
5,"Another Hit CD After ""Lo Mio Es Amor""","Oh, what a selection of songs this CD has! I bought this CD for one song since I already had a couple in single CD's and it came up to be an excellent CD. All the songs are excellent and unforgivable. No matter who you are, you must have this CD in your collection if you want to say that every penny was worth in buying this CD."
4,Good But Not His Best,"Released in late 1992, this album was a sign of greater albums to come from Tony Vega. So-so lyrics deserve a star less."
4,L'air du Temps review,This is a fragrance that my mother and sister really enjoy so I thoughtthat I would try it. It is a good fragrance.
4,Underwear is Funny,"For children, underwear is funny. I think many would find this book funny, too. The dos and don'ts are, of course, goofy (like ""Do put your clean underwear away, but don't put it in the freezer""). It has big bright pictures to illustrate each do and don't. To get a giggle out of child, it is hard to go wrong with a book about underwear (just saying the word is sometimes enough). If your preschooler enjoys silly books, then DO buy this one, but DON'T be mad at me if your child does not like it (children are difficult to predict sometimes and who knows your child better than you?)."
1,It Does Not Work,It just says it its qued it never downlaods.... But I have gotten other shows and it still does not download ... Dont waist your time or money.
4,"Paler than looks in bottle, beautiful neutral color","When I first saw this color, I thought it would be a brighter pink when actually painted on the nails. This is not the case, and for me that is a good thing. It is a beautiful neutral color, and looks especially good with tanner/browner skin (this is not me, but it is good on pale skin, too). Good alternative to the whiter nail colors that have been popular."
4,Great for pheasant fanciers,"I enjoyed the information this book has to offer. It is written so people of all ages and interests can enjoy it. It is recommended reading for anyone that is beginning to get into pheasants and wants to know about each breed, where they come from, markings, behavior and comparisons. In my opinion the book was too short, Leland Hayes has a LOT more to offer. I can't wait for his next books to come out. I can't say anything more except 4 stars and It is a 2 thumbs up book."
1,Upland Game Birds heir Breeding and Card,"I found this book to vague and not indepth enough toward care and breeding of pheasants. It did not expand on setup nor showed pictures of environments, cages, etc. It covered too wide of a range of game birds and did not focus on specific species. It was more of a description of the various birds, their native ranges, and their behavor and not specifically the care and breeding, setup and daily maintenance of the various speices.Being an advanced bird breeder, I was disapointed with this book due to its failure to provide sufficient care and breeding information. The author talked a lot but did not have much to say in the way of good useful information."
3,cutter triple play wrist bands adult,there nice but the only complaint i have is when i need to put 120 offensive plays on my wrist coach the last window is just a tad small due to the Velcro sewed on for closer covers up the last few plays it still does not hold 120 plays when using 40 plays to a sheet that the offer.....i could see using 60 plays a sheet but the print is so small even with good eyes they are hard to read that's why i went to 40 plays a sheet and it fails the 120 plays test just my opinion.. also I had to Taylor one of the bands because one of my qb's wrist are small but to big for a youth.. it worked fine but just had to throw that in there.. overall i rate them good.. what would be nice is to have a little pull tad attached like the hike ones have for easier opening of the wrist coach to the second sheet etc.
3,wristcoach doesn't hold up,"The wristcoach doesn't hold up well. It fits good, has a good display window, but for overall wear and tear it is poor. My son wore it during practice/games for 25 days. The plastic windows cracked and began peeling back within 23 days. For the short amount of time it was actually worn, it didn't hold up well at all. Unfortunately, it is the item required so we will have to order another one to make it through the season."
2,"Beautiful poetry, not accessible for all","This DVD is not closed captioned. Also it has a poor/grainy quality to it. Unfortunately, it is not accessible for people with hearing loss (Deaf/Hard of Hearing)."
3,Doesn't play well with some phones,"The casing around the 2.5mm plug is too wide for some phones with slightly recessed head phone jacks. I bought this to use with an LG ENV3, but I can't push the plug in far enough to make a good connection. Sometimes I can get a connection hold it with some pressure, but pops back out very easily.Other than that, it is a great headset. I don't have problems with it being quiet like other reviewers and the construction is solid for a sub $20 headset."
1,Don't waste your money,"First, you can get this for less than half of the currently listed price. Second, it's not worth even that. The volume control is only useful if you want to lower it. It doesn't even get as loud as the original phone volume with the control set at the highest level. The control is also placed too high on the cord near the headset. The plug makes lots of static in the jack if I bump it at all. The mute button is more than useless. There's no way to tell if you have it off or on until the person on the other line says, ""hey, are you still there...hello!"" Even with it off, the other person said, ""You sound so far away. What's wrong?"" My advice: try something else."
1,Too Quiet,"The headset is nice and lightweight on your head, but everyone complains that i am too quiet and sound far away even though i have the volume turned all the way up on both the headset and the phone. The mute button doesn't work at all. Also, i have a normal sized head but this did not adjust small enough for me."
4,Panasonic DMW Camera Xase,"Love, the color, style, and fit. The things that are missing is a slot for an extra memory card and/or battery. This is what keeps me from giving this a 5."
4,"Great case, but...","Good case - lots of protection, BUT NOTHING extra - only the camera - not even room for an extra card. My other minor gripe is it comes with a snap link style link to attach it to your belt loop or backpack. On your belt loop it lets the case flop around all over, and is not particularly handy. For a case this small, it would seem only apropriate to also have a means to carry it on your belt, rather than on a belt loop - but, no go. The Samsonite hard case for about 5 bucks also fits - and has a belt loop for attachment to your belt - a better deal, in my opinion."
2,Not very impressive,"The only good thing about this case is that it conforms to the shape of the camera. However, it is made of only semi-hard material which is easily compressed; there is no place at all to store extra batteries, memory cards or anything else; and it has no neck strap and no belt loop. The only thing it has to attach it to anything is a mini carabiner-clip which gives it little stability when trying to open the case and take out the camera with one hand. Basically, I found it just about useless and so I sent it back."
2,Durable but small,"This camera case is too small to fit the extra battery along with the camera. It has a carabiner to clip to yourself, which is helpful. It is durable, but not easy to get your camera in and out quickly."
4,Great for quick projects,"I just got this book a couple days ago and there are alot of great projects. Everything can be made in a short amount of time. You have at least one project for every member of the family at any age ranging from booties, a baby blanket, toddler clothes, a tank for your teenage girl, a sweater for the guy, and some great items for the 30ish old female - love the fringed cable belt. The yarns are a bit expensive, but it's so easy to sub another yarn. Everything is labeled either easy or intermediate, but more are on the easy side. I also have the Chunky Knits book, and will probably work from Weekend Knits more often."
1,Patterns Missing Crucial Information,"I borrowed this book from our local library and was interested in the Teen Tank but was frustrated to find that the pattern omitted the quantity of yarn required. Considering that the yarn proposed is quite expensive, ""guestimating"" the required yarn is not a feasible option. Just glad I borrowed instead of bought this book."
1,it dosen't fit,my husband just bought me a psp 3000....it dose not fit the psp is to big...waste of money....if you have a psp 3000 don't buy this...
2,Save your money and visit the Time Out Web site,"I bought this guide hoping it would give me more information on Amsterdam nightlife. It did, but it was nothing I couldn't have gotten from their Web site.Buy the Eyewitness Guide to Amsterdam, which is organized by area. It's visually pleasing and really helps you decide what you would like to do. The Time Out guide is organized by topic (for example, Accommodations, Restaurants, Art and Entertainment), and it's impossible to tell where these things are in relationship to where you are or where your hotel is. There are maps in the back of the book that are helpful, and I do like how for many of the topics they list the ""Top Five"". Again, much of this information is available at the Time Out Web site so I wouldn't waste my money. Buy the solid touristy Eyewitness guide and get the low down on restaurants, nightclubs, and coffee shops at the Time Out Web site."
1,save your money and do more research through internet,"I bought this book before going to amsterdam for the first time and was totally disappointed whenever I followed it's advice. In fact it is simply surprizing how bad the restaurant selection was. They should be called places to avoid. Amsterdam is full neat stuff. My advice find hotel online, buy a ticket and just go. Reading this travle guide is just wasting your time."
5,Sensual Lyrics from the beginning to the end.,"Domingo has always been one of those singers that can have hits from a CD and I end up enjoying the ones that weren't hits. This CD is no exception. I remember the songs that were hits of this album. I enjoyed this salsa gem. All the tracks are fabulous, beautifully arranged, combined with beautiful lyrics. The band is nothing less than expected from Domingo's work. This is his second album and it is an extremely hard to find album. This album was worth every penny I spent on it. I also recommend the album that came before and after this production, Domingo...Es Mi Nombre... and En La Intimidad. Domingo has a voice that I can hear for a whole day and not get tired of it..."
5,Seems to be high-quality,"First thing: I'm a home handyman, not an industrial user. I used the 5/32"" bit to drill into studs for using #10 x 3"" screws to attach a grab rail on a tub enclosure. The bit drilled well, and I did pull it out while spinning in each hole to clear the flutes. The bit spun perfectly straight when I tested it right out of the box. The 5/32"" bit is 8"" long overall, and the fluted part is 5.5"". It came to me in a nice 2-part plastic tube--an insert and an enclosing jacket, and that seems to be a good way to store it and keep it protected forever. I'm glad I own this bit because for #10 screws a 1/8"" inch bit is too small, and for installing long #10s the friction in a 1/8"" hole seems to threaten twisting off the screw in the hole and making a big problem; the 5/32"" hole was just right. I can hang my entire weight on the grab rail!"
4,relaxing lullabys,these are some of the songs my son likes to listen to while we are driving in the car for long periods of time.
5,Great buy,This was a great buy for our grandson... Our grandson love his music so the CD was a great hit for him.
1,Some how didn't work on my Aluminum parts...,"Don't think my motorcycle's aluminum bracket is any kind of space age high tech Al alloy, some how it didn't stick at all. Wasted."
5,Excellent treatise of evil supernaturalism!,Now I know why Mr. Horn's book is a bestseller among spiritual warfare books--it's excellent! Horn's in-depth and traditional approach to demonology is a breath of fresh air in an age so drivin by New Age occultianity. I especially appreciate contemporary military comparisons and the eye-opening analysis of angelic divisions. Highly recommended!
5,Total body workout :-),"This is such a good workout. There are actually two full step routines here. The first is only step and the second is interval step. Then, after both of those, there are some targeted toning workouts. This will make you sweat, huff and puff and tone your body and lose weight. Cathe is a good instructor. She knows her stuff and she is tough. All the workouts are really well cued and the choreography is good. The combinations are easy to follow and she uses easy transitions to get you into the next step pattern. You need dumbells and a stability ball and also an X-ertube for the toning workout.This is very do-able and fun. It will get your heart pumping and it's challenging. It's everything you could want in a workout. Who needs to go to the gym when you can do this so easily at anytime you choose?"
4,"Nice robe, but a few prickly feathers come out","All down robes are apparently expensive, so paying $70 + shipping for this one is actually a good deal compared to others on the market. It's exceptionally warm and soft and light, doesn't restrict movement at all, so it works great for someone living in chilly conditions. The only negative things I noticed is that despite the tightly woven fabric occasional feathers poke through and are quite uncomfortable on the inside; maybe that'll stop after a few months. Also, the down filling has its own scent - not very noticeable and not too unpleasant, but just seems like it needs deodorant or something. I haven't tried washing it yet - only had it for a month - so can't say what the effect of that would be.Basically I'm happy I bought this robe, but if I was to get a second one down the road I might try a different manufacturer, just to see if they're any better, although there aren't any guarantees that they will be."
3,The Goose Down house coat,The house coat is nicely made but is lightly downed. The feathers are not very thick. The coat is cumfortable and warm. All in all its about a 3 star item.
3,"Warm and generously sized, but prickly","Received this robe for Christmas. It's warm, fairly light, and generously cut. However, I need to wear pajamas underneath that fully cover my body, as the feathers in the fill poke me and are uncomfortable. As long as I'm wearing a full set of turtleneck long underwear beneath it, I couldn't be happier. If buying one again, I'd opt for one that is 100% down fill and not down and feathers, as this one is. Otherwise, it is a great product."
3,OK Deal for the Price,"I read prior reviews of this robe. I liked the price despite some worrisome reviews. It does, indeed poke you with feathers. It is not 100% down. However, that being said, it was very warm, with pj's underneath, so I wouldn't get poked. The white color is problematic especially if you have to get a wood stove going in the morning, or dogs, or kids, or cook breakfast. I am 5'8 and 130 lbs. I found the sizing to be a bit snug. I did not read the directions about cleaning!!!! I shrunk mine and now I'm shipping it off to mom to give to a teeny tiny elderly friend. Be prepared. I have feathers everywhere! It does leak feathers. For about $50 more, you can get, from Amazon, a 100% down robe, in multiple color choices, with none of the problems mentioned above. It's by Warm Things."
1,wrong book,Ordered this book for class and had the wrong edition sent to me. I emailed the company asking for the right edition but have not heard back
2,Basic Reader Behind the Times,The unit has let me down. Especially for higher capacity cards (>=4GB). Sony support mentions that the memory card isn't good for 4GB or larger cards. SDHC cards also suffer under this reader. You're better off finding a more modern memory card reader.
5,Works well,"I am not a tech guy. This card reader works great. I use it on 3 differnet laptops- Dell 9100, Dell X1, and an HP. Works easily on all 3. I bought it to replace a card reader that was about 7-8 years old. MUCH faster (I now buy Sandisk Extreme III cards for faster downloading)."
4,Good Memory Card Reader,It is very handy having this around. I don't have to remember which pc has the software for the camera anymore. I just plug the reader into the pc and the driver is automatically loaded. No complaints about this unit - it does what it is suppose to do.
1,Be careful Mac users,"This reader worked just fine on my PC laptop. The first time I used it on my Mac, it deleted all my pictures. I thought it was the card, so I snapped a few pics on another card and it deleted those also. I was only using a 2GB card."
4,"High build quality, slightly higher price","This Sony reader feels nice compared to non-brand name memory card readers because of its aluminum construction. For Sony camera users, it snugly reads Memory Stick Duos and MS Pro Duos without using an adapter. That is one big plus. I would have given the product 5 stars except the price is higher than other products who have the same read features."
3,Celia's disappointing debut album for RMM Records.,"This was Celia's debut CD for the RMM Records label and includes the big hits ""Sazon"", ""Cruz De Navajas"" and ""Bolero, Bolero"". For better or worse, this album was an unapologetically commercial one and it lacks the rootsy, classic Cuban music-flavored sound that epitomized her work with Johnny Pacheco or the robust, hard-driving New York Salsa sound that was so characteristic of her work with Ray Barretto and Willie Colon. Yes, Celia was one of those few and rare artists with whom it was virtually impossible to make a bad record but this album was quite a disappointment in comparison to her 1974-1992 recordings for the Fania and Vaya labels."
5,I love Celia Cruz!,"When I heard the song Te Busco in the movie Lantana, I just had to have it but I didn't know that it was not part of the soundtrack. It was only available on the Azucar Negra CD and... am I glad that I bought that CD. Celia Cruz is phenomenal and there are so many cuts that are my favorites now that I listen to it in the car, in the office, at home. Finally, a CD that I can enjoy from beginning to end!"
4,Great looking finished product...Very poor instructions,"The end result of the product is excellent, if you are an experienced builder. However, the people who created the instructions need 3 things; a proof reader, part number corrections and images that reflect the correct locations of pieces. I have been building for over 50 years and can't remember when the last time was that I saw such poorly done instructions. I recommend you take a deep breath and renew your promise to complete this beautiful structure...before you start.When you consider this coaling tower, realize that it was designed to accept LARGE steam engines from both directions. That means 22"" radius min on entry. To have a 4 track (coal drop plus three fill stations)from both directions using #6 turnouts or Wye switches takes up almost 8 Feet!"
1,still waiting for it to work,The pump came very fast and was easy to assemble. I have used a uv in the past with great success but this light has done nothing to clear my pond. I followed directions (pump size etc) but it has made no noticable improvement. I would not recommend this light.

4,Clay efficient,"These shoes are ideal for clay or similar surfaces. They have an interesting grooved breathing system. I wonder whether they will be long lasting, but time will tell. Overall I am happy with purchase."
4,Bad Girls,Good Movie . . . the girls do a great job in their portrayal of their lifestyle and their determination to get a more decent life.GOOD JOB GIRLS
4,"Good girl watching ""Bad Girls""","We first saw this movie on TV. My wife liked it so much that she didn't want to see how it ended until after we had bought it. Once we had ordered it and received the movie, my wife wanted to watch it from beginning to end. She said it was a keeper. It is now part of our collection. My wife describes it this way: ""it is a no-nonsense movie with women as the lead characters."""
1,"Bad Girls, Well They Were Bad...At Everything!","This is one bad film. I had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater. I wanted to leave. It was atrocious. The acting was terrible. The script was a laugh. Whoever would enjoy this really enjoys suspending disbelief above and beyond the call of duty. My imagination is pretty good and even can't imagine this ever being a good film. Robert Loggia is not bad in it, but all of the 'bad girls' are just that: bad."
1,"A lame, exploitative Western",THE WILD BUNCH with women. Four beautiful Hollywood actress are exploitatively cast in this predictable and absurd Western about four hookers who become wanted outlaws. It's so painfully obvious what director Kaplan wanted to do: take the standard Western formula (with every single cliche of the genre imaginable) and just cast the unexpected sex. Unbearable.
3,Average story by 4 beautiful female actors!!,Good acting by the four females--story is average. The only thing that was great about it was the parts where they were dressed as saloon girls. very sexy.
4,Have had this on VHS,"much better on DVD, a good movie....don't want to type just to type, can only say so much about any movie."
3,Female Western,"I really like both Madeleine Stowe and Drew Barrymore and really had high hopes for this movie, but frankly the storyline is weak at best. There is just no plot. Still, Stowe gives a great performance all things considered and I don't think I've ever seen Drew Barrymore look hotter. Worth renting, but maybe not buying, at least not before you've seen it."
5,Great movie now where is my DVD 20th cnetury fox?????,Andie MacDowell did a good job in this one and she is still fine like anything now a days:) Drew is of course drew and cool as anything....now only if this was on DVD FOX?????
4,good entertainment....,this film is just good old-fashioned fun and nothing more....the script isnt great...but the film will keep you wanting to know whats going to happen...just enjoy it for what it is...a fun movie...
2,"Fun to watch, but not a keeper","You can forgive the movie the first time you watch it because it is entertaining. It is always fun to watch four beautiful women kick some butt, but that is where the value ends. The plot is lacking in many ways, and the story is just not believable. RENT this one, don't buy it."
4,Worth watching,I'm not into westerns. My husband enjoyed this when I wasn't home and asked me to watch it with him. He said I would like this one. He was right I really enjoyed it. Definitely worth watching. Good example of times being touch for a woman on her own back then. Woman standing up for themselves and life in the time.
4,BAD GIRLS,NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS LITTLE OPUS.BUT THE GIRLS DO LOOK BETTER THAN A LOT OF COWBOYS(PICK YOUR OWN FAVORITE)IF YOUR INTO WESTERNS IVE SEEN SOME WORSE ONES THAN THIS SO THERE'S SOMEGOOD OL' GUN FIGHTS LOTS OF HORSE RIDING BEAUTIFUL SCENERY. YOU COULD DO WORSETHE CUZ
1,Just plain bad,"Bad movie. Bad acting. Bad western accents. Bad script. When you see this movie sitting on the rental shelf, just keep on walking."
1,OMG .....THIS WAS SOOOOOOO NOT GOOD,"One of the worst movies ever made. Bad script, bad acting. A horrible waste of talent of each and every one of the actresses."
2,Great for box and tortoise lovers,"The author was very knowledgeable about her favorites: box turtles and (large) tortoises. That's all well and good, but... None of these turtles are suited for indoor keeping! I would expect that most prospective or current turtle keepers want or have smaller turtles, and it would have been nice to get more detailed info about them. If you can keep your chenolians in an outdoor habitat, BUY THIS BOOK. Otherwise, find another."
5,Most useful and helpful information.,"I found this book to be great! It was full of useful and practical information for the beginning turtle or tortoise lover. It gives great descriptions of all types of turtles and tortoises, what size they are, how to care for them, what to feed them, housing and breeding tips. It's easy to follow and written so anyone can understand how to care for these wonderful creatures! I highly recommend it!"
1,Not Worth Money,"This book had numerous errors in identifying species in pictures and some errors on the care of the more exotic turtles that are listed in this book. It reads like the author(s) didn't have that much experience with many of the turtles in this book especially the more exotic animals and I'm not sure why they would even include them in this book as it is aimed at beginners.It does properly address basic setups so you have an idea of what you are getting into before you buy a turtle. However if you bought this book after you bought the turtle it doesn't really tell you much more than turtles are aquatic and tortoises live on land as well as basic diet overviews.Also the species profiles in this book are not worth the paper they are written on, you would be better off finding a care sheet written by a experienced keeper on the internet."
2,even as a novice I find many mistakes,"I can't even make it through this book because of all the errors in it--many bad suggestions on habitats and food for example. Also, the focus is way off for the average reader, as mentioned in some other reviews. Not worth my time to finish reading it. There is much better information available online for free from some reputable websites."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"I am a percolator type person, have been for years, so I know something about percolators. I LOVE THIS LITTLE PERCOLATOR! It's fast, HOT, I like the glass window to see the water level and that it has the old timey top to show the coffee. For fun go here to watch the original maxwell house commercial [...]I also like the small platform that plugs into the wall while you simply plop the coffee pot onto it and can take it to where ever you want.Cheers,Angela"
3,New Virtual Field Trips,"This book is good in that it has many different topics and several websites to get you started on finding a virtual field trip. However, quite a few of the websites did not lend themselves to easy virtual field trips or to any at all. A lot of extra work is often required and I question whether it was necessary for me to purchase this book when I think I could maybe do fine just googling a topic and finding something that would work."
4,OMI O YEMAYA!!!!,"India shows that she is Crazy Cool in this CD. Not yet Diva material, but she does a SLAMMIN' Yemaya & Ochun song that kicks Ass!!! It is the best thing she has done ever since doing her Ocha! I love this album and it is worth buying it. The balads are cool, but once again Milton Cardona and India are the bomb!!! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPA!"
3,Not a tight fit,"Not a very good fit, can easyly be bumped or shaken off of the old prime lenses I have put back into service on an new Sony NEX."
5,Truth can not be revealed by listening to one side only,"For the past decades, international community was only exposed to Armenian side of the story. This is one of the first chances of listening to the Turk side. The presence of the strong Armenian lobby supressed the facts in the Turkish archives . An unbiased person must listen to the both sides and to the facts, not to the arguments increasingly being distorted over years coupled with disinformation campaigns. Many neutral researches are being hindered by Armenian lobby and the results are dismissed with a blind rage. Every year the published deaths from the Armenians increase, to a point that it surpassed the total Armenians lived then by some multiples.DO NOT HAVE AN OPINION BEFORE YOU HAVE INFORMATION"
3,The Real Story,"I am the author of my family's encounter with the Armenian Genocide and I feel privileged to speak in regards to this matter and am proud to say that my experience lends a perspective that can not be purchased. The Turkish government may assume that the murders and atrocities done to the Armenians was not a ""Genocide"" but in my understanding Murder is still Murder and denying a ""Genocide"" never happened is still not by far unconvincing that a Murder never did as well. Anyone who lived a day in my young grandfather's life during his residence at Urfa, Turkey during 1895 will undoubtedly concur. I feel for the families with their losses and would hope that the Turkish government would live up to their responsibilities and pay their fair share of damages and we all know what my statement here is in regards to...it is regarding monetary losses."
1,Cowards,"Once again, a coward of a Turkish diplomat has tried to deny the rape, slaughter, torture, and expulsion of over a million Christian subjects in the Ottoman Empire. The author's attempt to conceal the Genocide of the Armenian people is a stain on all of humanity. Don't be fooled."
2,Like Soggy Toast,"Take some bread, toast it crunchy, get ready to taste great breakfast. Now, place it into a bowl and pour milk over it. This is what the book is like. Milk-Toast. It lacks power. It has all the theological words correct, it's not heresy, but it lacks the power of the Spirit. The author doesn't believe in tapping into this power. It may be a decent beginner book, but there are better ones out there. If you want teaching with power and experience, get Derek Prince or Bob Larson material.I lost count how many times the author mentions the greatness of his previous book. He never tells people with demonic strongholds to read anything else but his previous book. Not the Bible, only his book. The stories are about demonized people, but there is a lack of deliverance. No power. I get the impression this author wanted to jump on the deliverance band-wagon, but lacks real life experience to make this book worth anything. I gave it two stars only because he was not a heretic."
4,Much Better than the First Volume,"This sequel to Bubeck's book ""The Adversary"" is much better in quality and content than the first volume. The bulk of this work focuses upon the armor of God as described in Ephesians 6, and upon what it means to wear that armor in daily life. I've read numerous treatments of the armor of God, and the explanation given here is certainly among the best. For anyone wanting practical tips and insight on spiritual warfare, this title is by all means a very good investment."
5,Great Book!,"This book was required reading for college, but I really enjoyed it. Love that each chapter ends with a prayer to pray."
5,Harry Potter rocks!!,"I always hated Harry Potter but that was before I read any books or watch any of the movies. One night I decided to watch the first Harry Potter movie and ever since I've been hooked. I went out and bought all the books and I have the first two movies and I'm waiting for the third to come out so I can get it. Harry Potter is for all ages, I know this review sucks but believe me Harry Potter is great!!"
2,Widescreen or Fullscreen??,"I understand that the box set happens to have two cardboard cases( years 1 and 2) and one plastic case (year 3).My question is if it's the ""WIDESCREEN"" set why is year three the ""fullscreen"" version? Was it mispackaged? Has anyone else encountered this problem?"
1,Wait until the whole series is out to buy a boxed set!,"Don't spend money on a boxed set of the first three movies when eventually there will be a total of seven DVDS in the series. Obviously this isn't a good idea since the fourth movie was just released in theaters in November and there will be three more to come! If you want the boxed set, rent the first movies and wait until all seven DVDs have been released to have the compelete series."
4,I Hate harry Potter,"You may wonder from the title of my review why I would give this collection four stars, I took my ten year old to all of these movies and fell asleep in each one, but these movies are not directed at my generation, Sean at age ten loved them all and will watch each movie over and over, and better still, he has read each and every book - that in itself is a testament to these stories. We already own each title individually, if we didn't I wouldn't hesitate to buy this box set for us, I will be buying it as a gift because I trust Sean's judgement in regard to what a kid wants to watch."
3,"The ""box"" dilemma","I, and many others I've spoken to, was disappointed to find that while the first two movies came out in excellent cases, the third movie was only released in the more common (cheaper)""plastic"" cases. I would expect the boxed collection to have all 3 in the same beautiful cover has the first 2, but it just didn't happen. I'm extremely disappointed, and have not yet been able to bring myself to buy the 3rd HP for just this reason!"
5,Bringing Bacck Joy,"I never thought anything could bring me back to that wonderful world of far away from reality reality that reading HP books brought me. However, these tiny DVDs try hard. they are great, but they don't capture all the magic of the books......"
1,Avoid,"A friend of mine studying film borrowed this disc from his professor as a look into the job of a cinematographer. As a dedicated Lost fan, he invited me over to watch it with him. The documentary was tediously boring for me, but was somewhat interesting for him on at least a professional level. Considering the price though (at the time of this writing prices range between $70 and $130), I can't imagine recommending this to anyone. For dedicated Lost fans, there are special features on the DVD/BD sets that do a decent job of covering this ground and for those looking to get into cinematography there have to be cheaper (and at only 30 minutes, certainly more in-depth and informative) options available. At only 30 minutes, this would have made a pretty good extra feature on one of the DVD/BD sets, but, as an expensive, standalone purchase, avoid."
5,Third Album And Still Singing Good!,"Is his third album and all the tracks are excellent, all of them! Here he sings romantic salsa and they are affliated with the album's name ""En La Intimidad"". I highly recommend this album to anyone, no matter whether you are into salsa or not, shouldn't be missing in your collection."
5,Great tools,SK tools are just as good if not better than anything off a tool truck with a better price. Same warranty same USA made quality
1,not what i thought it would be,"This book was not at all what I thought it would be in substance. The title is misleading, especially ""with key to the scriptures."" It is almost impossible to believe the woman, Mary Baker Eddy believed what she wrote. Maybe in the context of her day it might have made a little more sense, but not in this day and age. A friend of mine whose parents were Christian Scientists, said there is very good evidence that her ideas were taken from a man named Quimby and that she had lots of help with wording, grammar, punctuation from a very well educated man of that time and that she rewrote it lots of times. So how can she claim that it was divinely inspired? I think much of the book is blasphemous. Also, I think there are lots of vulnerable people out there that could be hurt by this book if they fall for its ideas and quackery."
1,Jesus is a way not Mary Baker Eddy,"This is very dangerous book indeed. It's much better to read some kind of atheist propaganda against God than this book. Deceiving harmful for all Christians. I suppose people who knows their bible don't give much credit to this lowly kind of literature, but for young inexperienced Christians this book could be fatal. This book rather brings you closer to father of lies than to real truth which is in Jesus Christ alone."
3,A long awaited improvement on a classic,"Its the same book, all right, but you might not recognize it at first. (I didn't.) The print is more modern and easy to read, and it contains a much-needed index. Furthermore, there is space in the margins for notes. Same text, better format."
5,Needs to be in everyone's library who is seriosly interested in spiritual healing.,One of the best selling books on spirituality and healing for over 130 years. Brings the healing message of the Scriptures to light.
5,A Great New Discovery,"A few years ago, I was given this book by a friend. Before that time, I had never heard of Mary Baker Eddy or of Christian Science. I started to read the book, mostly out of respect for the friend that had given it to me. Within two weeks, I had read it from cover to cover. Since then, my life has improved dramatically.I would recommend this book to anyone. It may become a basis for the way you live your life, or it may simply provide you with another way of thinking about religion and health. For me, it has been the most wonderful discovery I've made, and I hope that others will be able to experience that same joy."
3,Africa in World History Review,"This book is good, except it does not use the most academic language. It seems to be for high school or middle school readers rather than college or beyond."
5,To the skeptical Republicans on these pages..,"I suggest you read the review below, citing the mother who refused to believe the photographs in front of her eyes. Assassinating Liberal leaders is nearly an American tradition. So easy. Nobody ever questions it or complains about it. In fact every Liberal leader America has seen since WWII has turned up dead at a young age. Imagine.This book is as comprehensive as it could possibly be in presenting an irrefutable argument for assassination. The evidence is there and it is abundant. Just as it was for the previous assassinations . America's silence on these matters is disgraceful. We owe a debt of gratitude to these authors."
1,Liberals go figure,Liberals always see conspiracy theories when one of their own bites the dust or they lose an election. If Wellstone was murdered then why wouldn't these nefarious forces murder someone with more power? Or when they claimed Diebold helped Bush win Ohio...why wouldn't Diebold help then Republican Senator Mike DeWine defeat Sherrod Brown? With liberal zombies everything is a conspiracy when they lose. It's just too funny. Wellstone was an average legislator at best. Isn't Bernie Sanders from Vermont a socialist? When do you think they'll go after him? From what I read in this book it was a joke. Not even a funny one at that.
1,Authors reviewing their own books?,"No, I haven't read this book since as of this date (11/1/2004) Amazon states it has not been released yet.Dr. Jacobs obvioulsy has read the book, since under the nom de plume ""Four Arrows"" he is listed as co-author."
4,"Geology, Science and Philosophy","I originally ordered this book because of a recommendation in the Wall Street Journal. While it was not what I expected, it was still a good read. Various writers from the last 2000 years (Pliny the Younger is the oldest) are gathered in this volume, discussing the various aspects of Earth geology. Mountains, Oceans, Rivers, Volcanoes; all have various small essays or excerpts from books illustrating that topic. While some are pure science, there are poems, native Americans describing their relationship with the land, a 12th century description of a Japanese earthquake, and much more. While I can't say it was a page-turner, the articles were definitely thought-provoking."
5,A Great Work,"The Furness Variorum edition of Othello tackles the different versions of the play that have appeared in print; copious notes and commentary beginning with the First Folio up to an edition from the late 19th century. Additionally, there is critical commentary from a raft of thinkers addressing such topics as Othello's color, possible dates of composition, duration of action, sources for the plot, and costuming. Furness even considers problems inherent in translating Shakespeare into other languages. A great work."
5,Profound Insight,"The title of Harvey's book refers to something insidious in our so-called civilized societies.Harvey's focus is on human relationships. She is not concerned with long lasting relationships between partners or family members, but the relationships that exist between all of us as members of a moral community. She deconstructs with incredible insight the ways the privileged oppress the unprivileged.My short explanation of Harvey's work does no justice to it. It seems simple and perhaps common. But I assure the work is neither of those things. This book, I think, is one of the best books in ethics to come in recent times. There are parts where she struggles with arguments, but I think Harvey's points are essentially right.""Civilized Oppression"" is a must for all people who like to think themselves as moral. I think everyone should read it."
4,Traditions,"For those of us who grew up listening to our parents favorite radio tunes, Paquita's lirics sounds, tone of voice and music background, sends back to a time of traditional values. I would recomend this CD because of some of the lirics, peraphs other listeners can relate to the my coments and enjoy this gift of hers that reaches the memories of an era that touches our hearths."
3,"Basic guide to house and ""patio"" gardening","This book provides me with little more information about its plants than would be provided upon a visit to the nursery, i.e. low light, moderate water, watch out for this or that pest...Not what I was hoping for. However, it does give a picture of every plant it lists (awesome). Also, I expected to find a book that strictly regards houseplants. Maybe I missed it in the description, but the ""Houseplant Encyclopedia"" includes plants like calla lillies- a plant that could be grown indoors, I'm sure, but isn't likely.Includes a good range of plants, including most of the houseplants I have cared for, and will occasionally offer some short description of natural history, which is also fun and interesting.3 stars pretty much because it wasn't what I expected/hoped for. Otherwise, decent, but not amazing book."
3,Only one complaint,"The book is great in regards to pictures and information. My only complaint is that it neglects to give the common names of many of the plants. Mostly it's just the scientific/family names. What I LOVE about, however it is the detail about the propagation of each plant and the detail in regards to the care of each plant."
3,"Good, but not GREAT!!","Although the book is comprehensive and has many tips on house plants, I only found 3 out of 25 plants in my house in this book. The photo section of this book is lovely, but it is titled ""The most beautiful plants from A to Z"" and does nothing for people like me with mostly all green house plants. Most of these plants they reference are blooming and floral. Make sure you know what you're looking for before you purchase this book!!"
1,Do Not Buy These Chairs,"I ordered 6 of these chairs. First thing that I noticed was that the wood stain was much darker than it was in the photos. It almost looks black. When putting them together two of the legs broke. The wood was very soft and fragile. I'm not sure what kind of birch they grow in china but I have never seen it so soft. I ended up wood gluing the legs back together, adding wood shims and extra screws to fix them. Each front leg is only held together by two bolts into very soft wood. I weigh 180 lbs and I feel like have to be very careful sitting down in them. I seriously doubt they would hold a bigger person. One chair had the holes drilled in the wrong spot in the back. I had to fix that as well. I'm not talking about 3 problems on one chair. 3 of the 6 chairs I bought had defects. Skip this product unless you want to learn how to fix them."
1,I didnt buy this,i dont know why this is coming up i never purchased this i did order some from moysha home furnishing and it was rediculous
2,Oldie but not a goodie,"I had the unique oppertunity to perform in my college's production of this show, and I must say that it is perhaps the worst piece of musical theatre I have ever worked on. In addition to the dreadful book, the score features only one remotely memorable song (unless of course you have a memory for childish, nonsensical lyrics and simple melodies). ""Sunshine Girl"" is a fun, upbeat barroom tune and the one and only reason to buy this disc, unless you happen to be a hugely loyal Gwen Verdon fan. Lovers of intelligent musical theatre will be sorely dissapointed...this is a disc for dedicated Verdon fans ONLY."
5,"Exellent, lovely lyrics and voice.","Cuando escuche a este muchacho cantar me henamore de su voz, despues que vi en persona me henamore de el. Canta con mucho entusiasmo, carino, y sentimiento. Le deceo mucha suerte simpre como la que tiene ahora.Lo quiero y admiro mucho. Sinceramente, Laura Arellano"
5,Classic Latin get your rythym going music.,"For a Gringo who loves the Latin Culture, but has a limited Spainish vocabulary, I was looking for music that would give me the heart of Latin Culture other then the traditional Mariachi bands. Oscar D'Leon delivers that in this CD. It's hard to sit still and listen to this production."
4,Psychology and hope,"There are some excellent and helpful secular books on women and anxiety. This one covers much of the same ground but from a clearly Biblical perspective. Furthermore, the hope offered here makes this an outstanding resource for Christian women. The book can also help men suffering from the same affliction."
1,Horrible,"Horrible product, is very cheap and the coloring is terrible. I wouldn't recommed this to anyone."
5,"all killer, no filler","I don't have much to say about this band, except for excellent songwriting and a tight band that hits all the high notes.Seller was true to his word and CD arrived in excellent condition. I highly recommend him and will purchase other music media from him in the future."
5,Love it,Works great on babies and kids fly aways!Only smells like lemon lime for 5 mins...goes away.Smell not over barring.
5,Can't beat Top-Siders,"Top of the line, and I have 5-6 other pairs of boat shoes (Rockport, Dockers, other name brands). No break in so to speak and look like they might last forever. Fast delivery as usual."
4,Good comfortable shoe,"The shoe runs true to size. It is very comfortable, and the quality is excellent. If it is a typical Sperry shoe, I will probably wear out the uppers before the sole gives out. To keep it looking nice, use shoe cleaner cream periodically. Don't apply any polish."
5,Great Jazz for kids and their parents,In a world of saccerine childrens music it's a pleasure to hear something that combines playfulness with some serious Jazz. I have found my son is delighted by this CD and as parents we have something we actually enjoy listening to. All it needs are more saxophone solos by a burning Haze Greenfield.
5,What A Treasure,"Can't believe this isn't getting more attention. Great vocals by Richie Havens, Miles Griffith. Saxophone and arrangements are smart, tender, funny --This CD will make you smile -- something for everyone."
1,vocals on this are just not up to par,"the vocal singing on here is NOT good/pleasant jazz -- the (...) editorial review which says the children singing along are more enthusiastic than musical is being kind. It gets extremely annoying to listen to totally out of tune children chiming in, and be sure you like ""gravel"" which translates to old and not very appealing voices such as that of havens & griffith who feature dominantly. I truly wish they had left out the vocals -- Dave digs Disney is wonderful -- one does not need those awful singers..."
1,is Marks really a YEC?,His position on creationism is far too sympathetic. These almost pathological liars at ICR (and other places like it) go around constantly misquoting science trying to deceive the public into believing their pointless cause. They deserve no understanding.
1,A wedge project?,"I have no evidence that this is an ICR ""wedge"" project, but it fits so well. Acknowledgements to and citation of Phillip Johnson; a sustained attack on the value and ethics of science and scientists; numerous references to unnamed scientists that want to destroy ""the meaning in people's lives""; sympathy towards evolutionists; smearing and innuendo..,. Yet at the same time he professes his own commitment to science, so the ICR can cite him as a ""scientist exposing the evils of science"".I was also amused that of the four books citing this one, three are Jeff Herman's notorious ""how to get published"" infomercials for scam artists."
5,"What it means to be 98% chimpamzee:apes, people, and thrie genes",This book I bought for my husband. He is reading it and has enjoyed all of it so far. Thank you for letting him buy it to read.
3,Workplace survival guide!,Unique guide to workplace problems. I personally learned a lot about office issues and politics of the system. There is a lot of great advice in this book and it is paired with a cartoon strip that relates to all the issues discussed in each chapter. Sometimes the cartoons are very cheesy and not that funny but they give life to the book and make the text entertaining and worthwhile reading.
1,who are they trying to kid?,"Gray matters is disappointing in many respects. First, the cartooning is crude and not up to standards set by syndicated strips. Second, there's not a single laugh in the whole book -- this is no Dilbert. Third, the advice is common sense to the point of being patronizing -- it features such brilliant insights as ""listen to people."" Wow, who'd ever think of doing that? Finally, several character actions are highly unethical and could get you in hot water if you did the same, such as breaking into a co-worker's computer, or moonlighting without your boss's knowledge at a customer company strictly to get inside information. You want to talk lawsuit? Read ""The Dilbert Principle"" instead -- its insights are hilarious and telling."
4,So far so good,This product is very good for the price.I have had it for 1 month and I am very happy.My documents are organized in just one place now.The only reason for me not giving 5 stars id due the lock.The lock is not very strong and reliable but works for me.
4,A Jewish Boy remembers surviving the Holocaust in Slovakia,"A fine, well written memoir of one of the few Jewish survivors of the ""Shoah"" in Slovakia. A young boy and his sister are sent to a Catholic orphanage to survive WWII. Very human, often sadly humorous; a wonderfully touching Christmas scene where the author and his sister sing ""Silent Night"", in German, to one of the occupation officers -- since the Slovak orphans do not know German... The author intimates, but does not divulge many, harsh Nun disciplines; but dispensed fairly to all. There are interesting notes about playing chess, learnt from his father; the whispered myth that a Jew would convert into a Christian and become Pope -- with the author learning many Catholic prayers by heart, in Latin, fanning hopes for such a possibility; snippets of fervent Nazi anti-Jew, anti-Catholic actions (""Jesus was a Jewish child..."" as the Nazis murder a priest). A sad, moving ending. Recently translated into Slovak."
5,Great pond food,"This pond food is great, especially for the price. The fish seem to really enjoy it. Not having tasted it myself, I choose to trust their judgement."
3,Pellets too large for most gold fish,Pellets are larger than ideal. Only very large fish may eat it. Or you can crush up pellets and cloud te water. If your fish aren't over 5 inches I advise smaller pellets to keep the water clean and fish fed.
5,Pond Pellets,"Haven't tried them yet, but will start today! hope it lives up to it's reviews,,, I am sure it will!"
3,Interesting reading,"I think that the book gives you some insight as to what kind of a person Joseph Pilates was, and where so many of his exercises stem from.. thinking of that era, and what was available at the time. It's always good to look back to see where we have come from and how we have progressed and changed. It may be a book that I would refer back to, but does not make for ""light"" reading."
1,Keyless entry,Cannot get fob to operate correctly. Seller has been very courteous and we have had several conversations. I gave up and got a different fob.
5,A marvelous start to such a promising career!,"Marc Anthony is the best and #1 selling salsa artist in the history of salsa. I knew his career would take off when I first heard this cd. It's been platinum after platinum. This is a great cd, especially the track, which has to be the best in the entire cd: Hasta Que Te Conoci. If you want to hear salsa from a really talented person, buy this cd as well as his second and third: Todo a su tiempo & Contra la corriente. And if you wanna hear a ""real"" pop album, throw away Ricky Martin and buy Marc's recently released self-titled debut album. Another success. Marc you are the best!"
4,i like this cd,otra nota is one of the first works developed by marc anthony showing us the best of this great singer
4,"Good price, accurate listing, and prompt shipping","A good price. After you get past the photos; one correct, the other a larger version. This listing was accurate: A Forespar 5/8"" vented loop with barbed hose fittings. Shipping was prompt and arrived before the estimated deadline in VA."
1,Not all RAW formats are the same,"I bought the software ( Jasc Paint Shop Pro 9 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.A BIG MISTAKE.I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format (*.CR2).UNFORTUNATELY, not all Canon .CR2 RAW files are the same. So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which Canon camera made the image. So far, there have been no update patches or upgrades to make the RAW images from my 30D useable by this package."
2,Needs improvements. http://www.bahamasissues.com/history,I have used paint shop pro from it's early days and to tell you the truth I haven't seen much improvements from then.Delroy Meadowshttp://www.bahamasissues.com/archive/
3,PSP ver 9 is NOT an improvement,"Paint Shop Pro ver 8 was the last best hope of a great image editor. Version 9, since Corel took it over, is slower, more gimmicky and harder to use. The browse/thumbnail viewer takes much longer and the edits just dogs. To compare I used ver 8.1 on the same machine and overall v8 is much snappier. Tech support with JASC (the original owners) was reasonable and prompt, Core's Tech support needs work. As with another product I use, Bryce v5 (a 3D editor), after Corel took it under their wing it's become software I don't really enjoy using anymore.PSP ver8 I would have given 4.75 stars. Sorry Corel you did not do this product a favor."
3,Paint Shop Pro 9,"I have had a Paint Shop Pro version since its beginning, in Dos and then early Windows. It has been a steady, solid program that I use almost daily. Love it.Thought an update would help since the prior program limits file names to eight digits - no other complaints.Well, this #9 version is a marvelous package, but entirely an overkill for my needs. It does everything (I think--haven't gotten through 1/10th of the book yet). It does take up a lot of space and may be worth it. I do plan to use it, but not for quick graphic editing (which is what I do most). Not sure that I will ever use the various layering programs or html type of gif graphics since I no longer edit web pages. Still have some animated graphic applications that I no longer use.Definitely worth the small price I paid for the package. So, no complaints. Wish I were younger (but I ain't dead yet)!Larry"
2,The Question for me: Will this work with Win 7 64 bit?,"This isn't a review yet ... I will indeed review it if someone will let me know if PSP 9 will work with Win 7 64 bit.I will NOT buy any of the Corel 'updates' ... as the reviews are overwhelmingly bad. Thank you people for posting them.I have used PSP 3 thru 8 and loved the prog. So I want to continue and will happily purchase the 'old' version if only I have some assurance that it will work. I suspect it might, as I installed an old Version 7 and it seems fine. I just miss my old version 8 which came installed on my old laptop, but I don't have the DVD to put onto the new Asus.So ... anybody tried it?TIA.edit 7dec12no answers anywhere ...so no purchase.that is all."
4,I still prefer this edition over the newest ones.,"This was the last edition in which Animation Shoppe was packaged WITH Paint Shop Pro. That was a big mistake on Corel/Jasc part, in my opinion. I recommend this program for anyone who wants to work with digital graphics, make avatars/signature banners, book covers, business cards, etc. It does what Photoshop does, and without the excessive bloat or price tag of PS.I do wish the book came with this. I have the book from when I originally owned this, before a former partner's grandchildren decided that busting someone's belongings and not telling them was okay. If you are willing to sit down and just play with PSP 9, you can learn it. I do recommend figuring out the keyboard shortcuts. All these years of using this program, and I just found out how incredibly handy the KB shortcuts are."
5,Wonderful even after 6 years!,"I have used this software (paint shop pro 9) for over 6 years and I have never had any problems!! I make graphics for webpages, touch up and transform photos... I really cant think of what I haven't used it for! I wish I could use it on my Windows 7 but it continues to work good on my older computer which has windows XP. I cant think of one bad thing with this software and it's way cheaper than Photoshop!!! I will be purchasing a newer version now it's called Corel (the old version is Jasc) for my new computer."
1,Bug Ridden,"Have been an staunch fan of Paint Shop pro for many, many years but this version gets the thumbs down. Version 8 had initial problems but this is far worse. I am running it on a Windows ME machine and on my PC it has problems recognising tiff files and the screen capture just does not work. There are numerous other bugs (including red eye removal) and I would advise buyers to wait until the software has been patched."
2,Problems with Vista 64 bit,"Works ok, but when selecting printer only default is shown. Also the program does not run well in Vista 64 bit."
1,thumbs down on PSP 9,"Great software, but terrible (non-existent) support ever since Corel bought JASC. You can't e-mail PSP tech support anymore and to try to call to get an answer is absolutely ridiculous - Corel disconnected the 800 #, replacing it with a regular phone number which puts you on hold, but is never answered - (you could theoretically be on hold indefinitely). Version 9.0 had so many bugs in it that shortly after 9.0 was released, a 34 MB patch was available. However, since Corel trashed PSP support, they never bothered to notify PSP9 users that a patch was available - even if you had properly registered your software.My advice is to stay away from PSP9 (and any other Corel software) until they realize that good tech support is a major reason for continued customer loyalty and subsequent growth in sales."
5,"Fast, easy, and GREAT","Paint Shop Pro 9 is my first professional photo software. I desperately needed it, seeing as I was struggling with MS Paint to make graphics for my website. It's easy to use, and self-explanatory most of the time. What little problems I had were either explained in the help section of the software or found on the internet. It's so much like Photoshop or earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro that I use tutorials for them on PSP 9 most of the time. One small problem, though, is that brushes on the internet are mostly for PSP 7 and 8. It took me months to find a forum that explained how to convert them to PSP 9 format. Other than that, this is better than any other program I've used a trial for and worth the money."
3,spongebob backpack,not exactly what i expected. it's not really a backpack in the sense that there is a big space for books and toys. it only has a small pouch in the back with a zipper opening. it will hold a sandwich and a box juice drink at the most.
1,Holst: The Planets,"The performance is great and the recording is good. The problem (for me) is I didn't notice it was a casette, vs. a CD. It never occurred to me I might find a casette recording on Amazon that did not make it abundantly clear it was, in fact, a casette. Of course, I wanted a CD and, after having perused the available recordings was delighted to have found that particular one. I just wish you had made it unmistably clear it was a casette."
5,Rocks,This processor works neat!! And amazing 2GB of RAM will run as much stuff you want at a time...
5,Very Quiet!,"This unit is a big step up from my older Aurora model. Much quieter and many more features. I've had this for about a month now and use it to shred my monthly personal expense documents and junk mail. So far, no troubles or disappointments."
5,"One of the ""BEST SALSA"" albums. Believe it!!!","This is one of the best albums of salsa ever put together. It's got rich sound, and voices that make your body move. While other CD's have maybe two three great songs, every song on this album from start to finish will take you on a tropical journey. No need for the skip button on this CD. Just pop it in sit back and listen. If you have never bought a salsa album buy this one! If you love salsa buy this one! If want to move to the rythem ... ""You know the rest!"""
3,A bit shabby,"The book was in a little shabbier condition than I had been led to believe, but it is still adequate."
4,old-timer tales of another time & place - fascinating!,"With a Foreword by Hugh Downs who moved to Arizona & came across this loquacious pioneer, with his authentic & amusing memories.In 1914 Hube Yates was all of eleven years old when his minister father uprooted his family from the 160-acre claim he had homesteaded when the Cherokee Strip was run, & with his wife & six children, & two wagons pulled by mules, they headed out from Guthrie, Oklahoma to faraway Phoenix, Arizona.Stories of another time in another place, told with a quiet, under-stated turn of phrase that demands you consider the twinkle in his eyes."
2,missing CD,"The CDs that arrived where in near perfect shape, unfortunately only 4 of the 5 where in the case. Amazon was prompt to refund, but I will not buy from this seller again. Agatha Christie is the QUEEN of British mysteries and missing some of short stories in this book was a great disappointment."
3,duplicate title,"The book was good for what I bought if for--to read on the plane-- though not as good as Agatha Christies' regular mystery books. I do not usually like short stores, but since I am such an Agatha Chrisitie fan I thought I would make an exception. The book was okay but not as good as her regular books. This is for someone who does not want to invest a lot of time in reading a good mystery. The down side is that this is the same book as ""the Thirteen Problems"" also by Agatha Christie. I did not know that and bought both of them at the same time. If there are duplicate books with the same name I feel the customer should be told this by Amazon. I am not sure why one book should have two names. I should have returned one of these but thought it would be too much trouble since I had never had to return anything else I had purchased. I will keep it as a gift for someone later on."

Me Siento Tan Sola5. Si Me Llevas Contigo6. Que Voy A Hacer Sin El?7. El Recuento De Los Danos8. Tu Angel De La Guarda
2,Not the best for the money!,Not a very enjoyable cd! It certainly is not one of the better music cds I have listen to! Sad
3,Watch Band Link Pin Remover,"This is a great concept. However, the pins it works with are not the right size for my watch, even though the info states it should work with my watch. My watch pins are much smaller. It is a thick sturdy plastic and should last a long time. But, it doesn't work with all watchband pin sizes."
3,Watch Band Link Remover Works Fine,Simple little device that helps remove the pins in a metal watch band. Comes with a couple of extra pins and an adjustable platform so it will work with many watch bands.
2,Not bad but cheap product.,"This came with Absolutely no Directions on how it works or how to use it. They sent a link on how to remove the watch band links but nothing on how this thingamajig works. All Plastic, would reccommend buying one that has some metal parts & better built."
4,Good Mainstream Piano,"This is John's first recording as far as I know. I turned on to him from noticing his playing on some of Mel Torme's recordings.His playing doesn't evoke any particular influences in my mind.... except on some of the light fills where I remmember some Teddy Wilson recordings who was as smooth as riding in a Cadillac. He's very much at home in mainstream, very talented, and thoroughly listenable.The cd has 2 trio cuts, 2 quartet cuts(guitarist Emily Remler), one quintet (Remler + trumpeter Joe Wilder), and five solos.I recommend this cd to anyone who likes one or a combination of good piano, mainstream, small groups or anyone familiar with John Colianni or as an intro to his playing."
5,Slow Down So I Can Tell You I Love You,"This is a really great book. It's not too clinical, but just clinical enough to give the author credibility. It's a very practical book for the ""average"" day to day lifestyle of parents who have kids with ADHD. I enjoyed the book very much and gained some great insights and perspective. I would highly recommend it. I wouldn't however, look for support from the main program that she promotes in the book, CHADD. When I read about that organization in her book, I was excited at the prospect of being involved in a support group like that. However, after only a limited experience with that organization, I found them to be too political. It's not that I don't agree with their position, it's just that it's focus is more on politics activism than actually providing support to families. The ulterior motive of the group was too flagrant and that was disappointing. I already have a cause...and that is my child. This, however, did not detract from her message or her book."
2,look elsewhere,"I must agree with the previous reviewer, this book is lacking.I bought a copy new and had the same problem where theholes punched in the paper does not match the binder spacing.What terrible quality. I had to force myself to even readthrough the book after that.And I found it lacking. The first part has some good infoabout how to write a policy. Good but not great.The second part was a sample policy/standard/procedure rolledinto one. I found it too thin and missing too much to bereally useful.I haven't looked at the text the previous reviewer recommends,but I have to say, given another book with similar content,definitely stay away from this one.My personal recommendation is Information Security PoliciesMade Easy, by Charles Cresson Wood. It's pricey but oh soworth it."
1,Terrible Seller,"I ordered this book a month ago for class. I am now in starting my third week of the class with no book. I have been getting help from my peers who have scanned to me the assigned reading pages. The seller claims that it may be my post office. I've been getting my daily mail, along with packages, regularly though. So where is my package!!! I've emailed the seller several times asking where is my package. I wouldn't have to ask if I was given a tracking #, but the seller said he didn't have one."
4,let it grow on you...,"first of all,there is a definite Iron Maiden thing going on here - on first listen,i couldnt focus on anything else (it's that blatantly obvious).upon repeat listens,the more original elements have a chance to come out & place this above a simple rip-off.as another reviewer noted,there are other styles of music in here which i feel only adds to the overall package.so,this is an excellent release of ""true metal"", competently performed and executed & will grow on you after repeat listens,if you can get past the Maiden worship (hey,there are worse bands to borrow from!)"
4,Great Starters Guide,"Without knowing much about internet programming or servlets, with this book I was able to get up to speed quickly on both subjects. It includes an excellent review of internet technologies as well as great coverage of servlets and JSP. And, unlike some books I've seen, all of the code examples actually compile and run!"
2,Very shallow coverage,"I'm quite disappointed in this book. Much of the book is devoted to listing the servlet API. I can get the API listing for free. What's not covered is the use of much of that API. If you're looking for an in depth book about servlets, I'm afraid I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
5,Great Introduction to Servlets and Web Development,"This book provides a great introduction to not only servlets but also to web development in general. Excellent for client-server programmers and others that may be new to developing applications for the web.The only drawback I noticed was that two chapters contained some errors about the location of files in JSDK 2.1. Apparently the book was published before the final version of JSDK 2.1 was available. Fortunately, the author provides corrections for JSDK 2.1 at: http://www.sourcestream.com/updates.html"
1,A book for beginners and not for experied java developers.,Do not expect a lot from this book going by the title. It helps a person new to servlets understand what they are.
5,The Definititve Starting Point,This book is perfect for those new to writing servlets. Callaway introduces the reader to the basics of web development (this was really helpful) and then servlets. His writing style is clear and readable. I read this book in about 2 days. I really don't understand the review by a customer that says most of the book lists the servlet API. He's wrong. Most of this book is good solid info any beginner needs when learning to write servlets. I highly recommend this book.
1,This book is for beginners,"Based on the title, I thought this book would give good coverage of servlets and some good examples. Instead what I found was shallow material and description of servlet API -- that too specific to version 2.0.I do not recommend this book to experienced servlet programmers."
4,THE MOST USEFUL FOR SERIOUS SERVLETS PROGRAMMERS,"The book covers detailed analysis on servlets programming and interfacing with database. It clearly explains each concept that is essential for programming with Servlets. I feel, this is a must-read book for medium level programmers for acquiring a high degree of programming prowess in order to become veterans"
5,This book is a MUST !!!,The author has a great style and the book gives us a very good introduction to the Web world with not easy to find information.Buy it !!!
1,Worst Servlet book I have ever seen!,I only have read the 1st edition but this should apply to the 2nd edition as well. It is obvious that the writer is not really up to the subject he is writing about. Book contains several critical errors that cannot be accepted. If someone is using this book to learn Servlet technologies he is never going to be able to write working and bug free code. Be aware!
5,GREAT INTERPRETACTION,"Joan Sebastian interpretations are always great, he sings with very deep from his heart in addition with those unique melodies composed by him. Nice album."
4,Good Mini Camera,This camera is great for someone who needs to fit their camera in a small place such as a pocket or purse. It is so small that I kept it in my purse at all times. In daylight the pictures turn out wonderful! Sometimes at night you need to make sure you are at a close enough distance that the flash can brighten up background. This camera is great for taking videos while on vacation. Who wants to carry around a camcorder these days?!? All and all this is a great little camera/video recorder/mp3 player/voice recorder.
1,Holy Carpe Diem!,"i bought this 5 days ago and the device may ""work"" but the cradle doesn't. After installing the USB drivers a dozen times and being put on hold by three differnt companies, i have had it. I bought this because i need a mp3 player and a digital camera. Silly me, I thought that companies want my business. Panasonic tech support is a joke. Sony has the best music. Microsoft can megabyte me. I am returning this device for the cheaper Palm zire 72. Which uses the same memory type."
2,Amazon sent me a dirty book,"OK, Henryk Ross book is not a dirty book. It's a great photographic account on the atrocities of The Third Reich. A beautiful, harrowing book. BUT our beloved Amazon sent me a very dirty copy. The cover paper was dirty, stains + something sticky on it. Dirt also inside the book, between the pages. Go figure..."
3,A fun book to read,"I'm not a language or history expert, but I love words, vocabulary and language. This book was fun for me to read just for the funny translations of English. I giggled out loud several times at some of the wordplay. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole book."
4,"Clever, funny, and intresting","Bill Bryson attempts to provide a guide of the English Language in a light hearted humourous way. The jokes make what would normally be boring reading more bearable and intresting. The facts which you learn from his encyclopedic knowledge on the subject, although often usless are just as often hilarius. Although this book makes for excellent reading it also lacks a certain something which would put this book in a league of it's own. Bryson claims to disagree with the beleif that English is superior to other languages yet through out the book we are left feeling that indeed English is superior. over all a lighthearted brief coverage of our language but not something I would read again."
2,Superficial and erroneous,This book has too many errors at every turn to be taken seriously. It is as scholarly as an article in a weekly magazine. Not reccommended.
3,Disappointed.,"Book took forEVER to arrive. I ordered a book from London at the same time that I ordered The Mother Tongue, and the book from London arrived weeks earlier. Not only that, but the condition of The Mother Tongue was poorer than the seller described."
5,A book worth rereading,"An absolutely delightful introduction to a history of the English language. Like the author's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", it approaches a huge subject with great enthusiasm -giving me a general understanding of a topic I previously knew very little about. A joy to read.I've taken a few moments to write this very brief endorsement because I saw that one person was dissuaded from purchasing the book because of a one-star review. What a shame."
3,Excellent overview of a world language for non-experts,"Tell your humor editor there's nothing funny about Welsh (lucky she's 3,000 miles away). This is a great overview of the English language and how it has developed over the centuries and in so many countries both as a first and a second language. Two minor quibbles: the author doesn't make clear that Welsh is a phonetic language, i.e. it's pronounced as spelt; he got a little baffled by English pubnames, e.g. ""The First and Last"" isn't a baffling name - it describes a pub on the outskirts of a town, so it's the first one you see when arriving and the last you see when leaving; and similarly ""The Tumbledown Dick"" is a reference to the overthrow of Richard Cromwell (what did you think it meant?) I recommend this book to everyone."
3,okay,"The book which we really like was in much worse shape than it was described...but that said, we are happy with the book and will just pass it on when done."
4,Brilliantly witty and utterly enjoyable.,"This is a lighthearted look at the intricacies of the English language: its history and development as well as colloquialisms, modern slang, and general language-mangling by non-native speakers.It's not a reference book, but a playful examination of one of the most intricate languages on earth. If you're more fond of pedantic linguistic analysis (as many previous reviewers seem to be), it's best to look elsewhere. If, however, you have a good sense of humour and are up to a fun read, definitely check this out."
3,Very enjoyable and very inaccurate,"Entertaining, interesting, fun -- and no editor shouold have let it out like this. The frequency of factual errors is stunning: dozens and dozens I've caught, and that's just a sampling. Other reviewers have listed a number of errors, so I won't recap. Read and enjoy - but you should treat it like Wikipedia: you shouldn't assume that anything in here is accurate without doublechecking elsewhere."
2,Enjoyable fiction. Fact it is not.,"Although the book has some entertaining segments, the severity of the errors in it makes me wonder just what the author considers research. The chapter on swearing claims that Finnish has no swearwords, and that Finns have therefore chosen the word ""ravintolassa"", meaning ""in the restaurant"", for use as an obscenity. This is utterly ridiculous. A professional should have kept in mind that native speakers of the less widespread languages of the world enjoy comic relief by teaching foreigners nonsense words as swearwords, and obscene phrases as confessions of love. Even as a second-language speaker of English, I found flaws in his depictions of dialects, flaws which many reviewers have cited before me. The author seems to have researched his book with a beer in hand, never bothering to double-check any of his information. If viewed as fiction, this book has its moments. Fact it is not."
5,Spreading the Word :),"Bryson takes you through the linguistic and historical journey of English in a wonderfully informal, comedic, anecdotal, and fact-based way. I'm a high school English teacher and I'm having my juniors and seniors read it for class--they love it!! He reaches a wide array of audiences, trust me, making a possibly dry subject a fun and accessible one."
5,Nice light and informative read,Can anyone right a book like Bryson? He makes etymology fun in this hilarious and interesting book. Have you ever why a certain word means a certain thing. Where did these words come from? This book will answer these questions and make you laugh out loud.
3,Not as good as other Bryson,"Like any Bill Bryson book, this is a fun read, but in some passages the author pretends to find some bit of usage more confusing than he really does, just to make a point. This happens often enough to become a little irritating, but it's still pretty enjoyable."
2,An enjoyable work for a non-specialist.,"Bryson's writing style is thoroughly entertaining, but the book is lacking in factual support. Particulary disturbing among the many errors of fact is the statement that languages apart from English do not have and do not need thesauri. This is simply not true, and implies that the English language is somehow superior to other languages, although Mr. Bryson claims to disagree with this belief. This could be due to poor research on his part, as Mr. Bryson apparently does not speak any foreign languages and therefore would not have any personal basis for comparison. It is regrettable that Mr. Bryson's enthusiasm could not be coupled with a corresponding amount of accuracy. Perhaps the author will revise and correct his work for future publications. (And for those who are interested in another mix-up, Mons is the French name for the city in Southern Belgium, and Bergen is its Flemish Dutch name. In the book, the names were reversed.)"
1,Not everybody should write a book on language,"Sadly, Bill Bryson is most definitely not qualified. The book is sloppily researched all over, and Bryson's cheerleading for English as in some way superior to most other languages is tiring.Makes one doubt the quality of the information given in a work as A short history of nearly everything, which I thoroughly enjoyed at the time..."
3,"good, but not great","Having read Bill Brysons ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", I was looking forward to this read with a great deal of anticipation.However, although it was a satisfactory and interesting piece, it never really lived up to what one has come to expect from this author. He tended to get bogged down in sturgy lists of words, and the finer points of pronounciation, in which there were several instances of innacuracy. The book became increasingly heavier going in the later chapters, and I found myself repeatedly skipping pages towards the end.For anyone who wants to read a more accurated and scholary, but at the same time immensely readable review of this topic, look no further than Melvyn Bragg's ""The Adventure of English""."
4,"Entertaining, but full of errors","This book is one of the best ways to get anyone to learn about the English language. The anecdotes and examples are very funny. However, they are often inaccurate. Eskimos (Inuits), for example, do not have 50 words for snow. They have two, namely, aput and qanik. The morphology of their language makes it possible to combine two distinct words to form another. Dirty+snow = dirtysnow and so on. Anyone who has any sort of background in linguistics should be on guard for such mistakes. The book IS amusing... but one should not, by any means, take it as canon."
2,Interesting But Also Disappointing,"I'm a fan of Bill Bryson. ""Walk in the Woods"" and ""The History Of Almost Everything"" are 2 books I recommend to friends and family.I'm facintated by the subject of languages and how they develop and evolve. Some chapters were very interesting, others became bogged down in too many linguistic technicalities for me and I resorted to skimming or even skipping to get through them. Others with more knowlege than I, have commented on the errors and misstatements by the author. After reading those reviews, I'm sorry I spent time trying to absorb many of his explanations, observations and factoids. There may be other books, with equal credibility but more readability on the subject."
4,lots of laughs,"I read this book during a summer break while camping, and it was a very enjoyable read. I have read many unhappy scholars' reviews of this book, that there is misinformation, incorrect facts ... and that might be true ... but for a lucky-unknowing-uncaring reader looking for some fun and lots of laughs ... this is a great choice!"
2,Easy to read- -sloppy scholarship,"This book consists of a series of essays about various aspects of English. On the whole, the book is well-balanced between describing British and North American varieties of English. The writing style is quite fluid and the book is, for the most part, very enjoyable to read. However, Bryson was not always careful about the quality of his scholarship; he often gets his facts confused or repeats ""factoids"" that are known to be false. On page 14, for instance, he makes reference to the old Eskimo snow vocabulary myth, claiming that Eskimos have 50 words for snow (see The Great Eskimo Snow Hoax for a more accurate account). On p. 107 he manages to associate the Martha's Vineyard pronunciation research with Trudgill instead of Labov. Since he makes so many errors, a reader can't tell for certain whether the remaining material is trustworthy. Readers of this book may find themselves more misinformed than informed."
5,kept a class of 8th graders spellbound,"I don't care about the errors. When I was asked to read to a class of 8th graders, I chose excerpts from this book. The whole class was spellbound, sometimes laughing, sometimes pondering and always interested. The teacher says she wants her own copy, and the class is asking for me to come back and read more. What could be a higher recommendation?"
4,Like Words? Like Language? You'll like this.,"Ever wonder how and why we ended up speaking the way we do? Here are your answers.Bryson addresses which people and which languages came together to form the basis of the English we speak today. He lays out the types of words that originate with the various groups and examines the process of word creation and the migration of words and pronuciation.For anyone who likes language and would enjoy knowing more about how and when English came to this point, this is a good - and fun - read."
2,The Mother Tongue,"A friend lent this book, knowing of my interest in language(s). I was sort of taken aback just from reading the bloody cover, which avers that English has more than 300 million speakers (can't remember the exact wording, but the number is correct, except that it's not even close to correct. What about India, e.g.?And then to read that the word schadenfreude gives an insight into Teutonic sensibilities? Good grief! What an insult to many millions of Germans who developed one of the highest attainments of civilizations on earth.Lib PC is a fatal curse, and Bryson is a carrier, imho."
4,Great and loaded with terrific historical references!,"This was a great book. After reading Bryson's Walk in the Woods, I fell in love with his sophisticated humor and wonderful style of writing. He is great author! This was another mind pleaser"
4,Get a sense of humor folks! He is a humorist!,"If anyone has had the good fortune to listen to BB read his own books, you would have 'gotten' this book.For the love of Pete, loosen up, he is not a linguist and never purports to be."
4,Suarez' Going Under captures life on the hyphen!,A new wave of fiction by and about 2nd generation Hispanic Americans has finally arrived. Virgil Suarez' Going Under seeks what it means to be Cuban American in Maimi. The sweet success and bitter failure of Cuban in the US has never been more candidly explored in fiction
3,So-so,"I guess, since I got it for free it was worth the money. It was hard to understand what to do because he screams the whole time. The first half of the workout is ai ally marching in place with a couple of things thrown in between the marching. The second half got harder, I wished the whole workout were at that pace."
4,5 Single Syringe 1 Piece Cases Color Blue,Product was as advertised and delivered promptly. No problems.
5,Historia de la Luz,This is a wonderful salsa band from Japan. The interpretation of all salsa hits is great. I love to hear this CD of Historia de la Luz. May God bless this band! I strongly recommend this CD to all salsa listeners and dancers.
4,Unbelievable! Japan is now a Caribbean country!,"If you thought Latin music was a Latino-only trade secret, think again! These Japanese cook up a salsa better than some Latinos themselves! This album has beautiful brass, great arrangements, and a solid Latin feel that can only be produced by masters of the music, even if they are not Latino! Highly recommended for salsa lovers!"
4,south coast balla's,this cd has the tight beats you would expect ...and you know these dudes got skillz on the mic....tight tight cd
4,A Child's Look at Adult Life,"Narrated by a young girl, this book asks why parents are so boring. Brightly colored illustrations accompany the narration which is from a child's perspective. The two parents have more than enough to deal with from their three, energetic, fun-loving children. Readers will delight in the satisfying conclusion to this book as the parents learn to have a little more fun."
5,This is a really cute book!,"I love the humor in this book! It is a good reminder to us parents to slow down and laugh and play with our kids. Great illustrations, too."
1,This book made me ill.,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer J. Mullally, this ""hero"" has nothing whatsoever to recommend him. On the carriage ride home after the visit to the king he says such horrible insulting things to our heroine that I would never have forgiven him, much less worked for him another minute, no matter what he threatened to do if she quit. And marry him? Rather take the hangman's noose than this obnoxious, bloated, aristocratic bag of wind. He actually states that she's not good enough to marry to her face. Throughout his entire tirade, none of it deserved by her in any way I might add, I found myself actually growing sick to my stomach at his cold, cruel, and completely merciless attack on her character.Nothing he did afterward improved my opinion of him. And Helena certainly deserved much better. She was a jewel and the reason I kept reading.No stars for this book. None. And I'm GLAD his hand was smashed to bits. Too bad it wasn't his brains."
1,Superficial,"This was the first Collin Wilson book I read. He has probably read a lot to write this book, but to anyone at least a little into the occult it is clear that he have no idea what he is talking about.If you are interested in this matter (the occult knowledge) as something you would read about but never, ever try to verify if it is true or practice anything, maybe this book is ok.But if you are serious about it and really want to know what true and what is fake, please stay away from this book. He is so wrong about even simple things that could have been verified with just a few months of practical experimentation."
4,Outstanding,This was his first production which i think is his best.He has original songs and even though he sounds alot like Hector Lavoe he keeps his originality and ads his personal touch.
2,Excruciatingly Mediocre.,"Being a lover of RHPS and some ""punk"" music, I had high expectations for this CD. Unfortunatley, I found many of the songs hard to listen to; some of them didn't even sound like their movie counterparts at all. (The worst being ""Dammit, Janet"".) I knew that they would sound different (otherwise, what fun would it be?) but they could have at least tried to stay in tune. The only song I can give a really great rating is the Alkaline Trio's version of ""Over at the Frankenstein Place"".If you have an overpowering urge to listen to Rocky Horror songs, buy the Rocky Horror soundtrack, but if you have to have either every piece of Rocky Horror memorbilia or every punk compilation you see, buy it."
4,I love this album,"But if I could change some minor things, I would have gotten a better version of The Charles Atlas Song, which is just barely worth listening to. Although everything else is pure gold. And my current faves on this album are Time Warp (Groove Ghoulies), Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me (The Chubbies), and Planet, Schmanet Janet (Tsunami Bomb), and all the floor show songs."
3,Average punk!,"Ok, I saw this album and bought it, love the origianl. At first I wasnt too keen on the album (yes I said keen). I have listened to it a bit more and you know what, I really enjoy it alot! It was worth the 11.99 I paid."
1,make it stop,I bought this cd because I liked the songs of Jimmy Van Hausen. There weren't that many cds by songwriter so I settled on Rosemary Clooney. I didn't think that particularly disliked her voice on other songs but she murdered these songs. I played them for my mother she could stand to listen to more than three songs.
4,Very good Tribebook!,"I've seen this book before (from a friend) and have used it once. My opinion on it is very positive- as most tribe or clan books, it helps develop the character with disiplins, rituals, and/or gifts. I highly recomend this and other books of it's type."
5,i love this thing... shiny...,"Is it worth more to me than the price I paid: No, 20$Would i recommend it to a friend: I haveWould i buy another one if this broke : Probably"
2,Doesn't come with staples?,"I ordered this product assuming it would come with staples, unfortunately, it did not... and so I'm left with a semi useless stapler until managing to get back out to a store."
1,disapointed,in the description of this product it clearly states it's polished chromethe stapler is silver ! NOT CHROME ....while i know it's only a staplerit would be nice to have a correct description of what your buying ....
3,Nice try - but....,"This is a nice, retro-style, collectors' edition of a stapler that has been around for decades. I remember these staplers from when I was a child - 'the difference being that this one is completely chromed, unlike the ones that were red or black plastic (maybe Bakelite) that I recall. I would have easily rated this a 4 or, or even 5 stars - but when I tried to staple my first stack of papers, I found it didn't have staples pre-loaded, or even a ""starter pack"" of staples included in the packaging! Be prepared that when you spend $19 (plus shipping) on this ""collectors"" edition stapler, you'd better remember to order a box of staples, or that you'll have to make a separate trip to Office Max before you can actually use it! I think the ""Swingline"" Marketing folks really dropped the ball on this one - I had expected a ""little more"" (like 10, 20 or even 100 staples!) for this ""premium-priced"" product."
4,Chewable is not soft!,"I always thought chewable meant a soft capsule, but quickly learned these ae not soft but hard like a dog biscuit. Nevertheless, I cut each capsule in half for my 15 lb. schnauzers."
3,No so towelly,"I am a beekeeper so I love everything with bees. Including this towel. However, they are very thin, and they are about as absorbent as a brick. I know this is normally expected, but these seem to be worse than usual. I washed it a few times, and it got marginally better. I will still use them because they are pretty and they match my kitchen, but they are not my first choice when I need to actually USE a towel, especially for that price."
5,More entertainment from our beloved 8-bit theater author,"My goodness. Have you played all your video games to death? Do you have NOTHING to do at home other than sit on your butt and wait for webcomic updates? Then buy this book! You'll enjoy it so much the first time, you can't help but read it again! The stories are rich with humor and adventure. This is a one-of-a-kind book. Buy it. Buy it now."
1,Amateur work by a pro,"Not the worst thing I've read - by far, it still has less editing issues than most of the retro-self-pub-pulp out there, but it is nowhere near the current quality of the writer's work. Clevinger should probably give it a polish/re-edit and republish it..."
4,What?,"Why are people reviewing this book without reading it?No its not Febreeze.Yes we all trust Brian, but wait until you get the book please. Its not necessary to be using the reviewer space as a forum. Once purchasing Nuklear Age you may review it as a responsible customer. On a side note, I don't have it yet either.I rolled a four-sided dice. It got 4 stars.Oh and just so you rate this review helpful. Here is a friendly tip on how to remove grass stains.1. Take a pair of scissors.2. Slice around the stained area.3. Throw either the scissors, the stained cloth, or the original piece of clothing out.You win a pie."
2,"Interesting at first, then...","I was interested in this book for the first few chapters, then found myself not really wanting to continue. The story and its humor just didn't do it for me."
3,Spoon?,"When I first stumbled upon 8-bit Theatre lo these many moons ago, I read the sample chapters from this book. I even looked at the now defunct image gallery.But what was there seemed a bit too tedious. I went in looking for a much more savvy Tick, but found it lacking the strange charm imbued in the philosophical waxings of my big blue idiot savant. Simply put, it tried too hard.Now that I have a copy of the completed book, I've found it's improved, but not enough to fully satiate me. Brian does have wit and style, but as such it is a style better suited for one liners, running gags, and visual puns that can only be pulled off in a few electronic panels of pixels. Anything longer like black type on paper and he's not only firing with half his artillery but running out of ammo.Then again, maybe after all the years it took to bake the book, the produce has gone sour.I did enjoy it to an extent though, but constructive criticism builds character.Edgar BlackadderDark Fiction/Fantasy Rampant Review"
4,Hilarity!,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a book with some semblance to a normal type of plot once I got over the fact that the book reads differently than ""normal"" novels i enjoyed it a lot more. One thing I noticed was even after I waited a couple of years for the Nuklear Age to be edited while I read 8bit theater there are many noticeable errors its nothing important and it doesn't detract from the book. well anyways the book is funny to the max and anyone should buy it if they are a fan of 8bit theater"
2,8-Bit Fan? Watch Out.,"Funny how this seems to be the first review on here from someone not speculating on the contents of the book. Personally, I've been a fan of the author's since way back when.I did not, however, enjoy the parts of this book that I managed to sit through. The jokes are overused, and lag behind his other work to begin with. For completists, however, this is a must-have; it clearly shows how his brand of humor and style of writing has evolved to where it is today, making it interesting in a way Clevinger probably never intended it.A good stress test to see if you'd enjoy this book is this: load up his comic, then read 25 or 30 of them at a stretch. If anything about reading that many at a time bothers you, this book will only amplify that annoyance. If you enjoy every bit of what you read, pick this up immediately."
1,Not Accountable for Program's Flaws,"I have been frustrated by Davka's lack of accountability in the program's flaws. The Judaic texts found in the text library lack proof reading and have an astonishing number of errors in nikkud and spelling. When I inquired about the flaws they responded that the program is sold as-is and no refund or compensation would be granted. This is poor editing and shameful customer support.If that wasn't enough, the program is counter-intuitive, especially for those of us who are used to creating documents in MS Word or any other word processing program. The help menu lacks content and is not user friendly.This program has serious problems and a steep learning curve. Purchase at your own risk."
2,A Decent But Flawed Mystery,"This is the only book of the series which I have read, so I cannot compare it to the others Ms. Peters has written. I found the story to be a decent enough mystery, although the ending seemed to be more of a fizzle than a climax, and the introduction of the main villain at the end being a character which had not really been dealt with throughout the book was to say the least confusing. The books biggest flaw, I thought, was the inclusion of the constant feminist commentary. I am far from an anti-feminist myself, but I found the frequent rhetoric quite tedious and distracting"
3,Not as fast-paced,"Unlike her other Peabody mysteries, this one got off to a slow start, but still concluded wonderfully. Peters' dragged a bit in placing the characters in unfulfilling situations, and the usual excitement wasn't there. Still, an essential Peabody mystery to read."
2,crossing over to inspirational,"Our family has enjoyed Jim Rule's live shows and previous records. However, with this most recent record, he seems to have moved from a basis of just plain fun to one of evangelicalism. It's over the line and a little more than I care to hear..."
4,SeaClear aquarium,"Look nice..I don't have to worry about leaks and the seams(there are none)..a little difficult to access the inside as the openings are narrow on the top...feeding time requires a very small hand to reach in the back slot/opening..or one must remove the kighting and cover to access the tank...also, a disappointment that a BULB was not included for the light(yes, it was mentioned in description of tank)..Overall, it is an ok product. Looks nice."
3,Life Of Mammy Tittleback and Those Around Her,"This is a story about Mammy Tittleback and her kittens as well as the other cats in her life as well as the people close to her. I thought this was an okay story, nothing to exciting happens but it is nicely told. There are four cats that die through out the story so if your child is sensitive to this it may not be the right book for them. It is a short story and I read it quickly."
5,"This cd is great,but Borders has it all wrong.",These are the real songs by the real artists:Hawaiin Roller Coaster Ride(Remix)~Jump5I Won`t Say(I`m In Love)(Remix)~The Cheetah GirlsThe Bare Nessesities(Remix)~Bowling For SoupThe Second Star To The Right(Remix)~Jesse McCartneyCruella DeVille(Remix)~LaLaineUnder The Sea(Remix)~RavenColors Of The Wind(Remix)~Ashanti and Lil Shi ShiThe Siamese Cat Song(Remix)~Hilary and Haylie DuffPart Of Your World(Remix)~Skye SweetnamIt`s A Small World(Remix)~Baha MenStrangers Like Me(Remix)~Everlife
5,love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,love this cd!the best song to me is Colors of the wind by Ashanti and Shi Shiall the remixes are great and if you like the Disney mania cds the get this or if you just like Remixes for the beats this is a good cd to have every song sounds cool and some even better then the original version!If you love Lalaine get this cuz she really shines on this cd!
3,bring on the good stuff,"don't get me wrong i love the product fine shipping and all that, i just wait for a few other tracks to be released hopefully in disney mania 5"
1,dead plant,"i recieved it on time but the plant was about a cm big and shrivelled up. i tried to bring it back but no luck, i dont know if it was the shipping but i paid for a plant that i thought that it was gonna be bigger than a cm, dont think i will purchased from this company again."
2,Maybe I used it wrong???,"I tried this sensor cleaner only to leave streaks all over my sensor, and lens. Maybe I used it wrong, but I don't think so.It is supposed to be streak free, but my results were not, and it was not due to a super dirty sensor/filter.I just don't think this product works."
5,a very funny story!,"I also got this book when i was about 11 in the Troll Book Order packet. I will never forget the drawings in the book. The more things Golly Gump eats to get rid of the fly he swallowed, the bigger his stomach gets! I laughed so hard at this book during class that the teacher had to sit me in ""Time Out"". I have a very happy laugh. I can't help it. Hey, i was reading the book she should have rewarded me for reading !.. Anyways If you have a kid age 8-12 they will like this book. Its very kid friendly and safe for children to read and understand.And did I mention that it's funny?!"
4,"Part mystery, part romance","Neggers wrote an interesting tale, but put in so many characters all at once that when the action picks up halfway through, you're asking yourself, ""Who's Judith?"" or ""Who's Sarah?"" A little slow moving, it picks up and has a delightful plot twist at the end. Throughout the book, you feel Ashley's angst at not knowing whom to trust or who is after her jewels. A little contrived at the end, but a nice end nevertheless. There's a summary of Hungarian history from the beginning of time - REALLY LONG. If you're not into the history of Hungary, skip over it - you won't miss much. Parts of it are reminiscent of Sidney Sheldon or Nora Roberts, and in those times, you won't be able to put it down"
3,Old Memories From One of His Characters,"What a gas! That ""It Been Down So Long"" is back in print... It brings back a lot of old memories. To know a writer, and bits and pieces of his life at a time he writes a book about, is to give the book a frame of reference only a few have. Time and distance have given those memories the sepia cast of old photos [to paraphrase a better writer loosely: it was long ago and in another country, and besides, the lad is dead]... From One of His Characters"
2,Looks Like Bad Writing To Me,"I found this a badly written, sophmoric book, unrealistically hyped by the publisher's marketing department. Much of it read like the liner notes to a Bob Dylan album. Uncommitted readers who would like a little literary content in a novel of college life may wish to try Malcolm Bradbury's The History Man. But for a really gripping tale, complete with a deranged college student on the rampage, and high doses of psychological tension, try Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment - the ultimate novel of university life."
3,Nostalgia isn't what it used to be,"For maximum enjoyment of this book, I suggest that you read it in 1968 when you are 17 years old. You will think it's hip, relevant and revelatory.Those forced to read it in dreary 2008, however, may find its charms drifting right over their head. What to make of the paragoric Pall Mall, women's dorm curfews, the ""rucksack""?Even now, however, it's valuable as an anthropological exploration of the dawn of the Sixties, when young adults, who had up until then been dismissed as children whose lives had no read impact on the world of adults began to see themselves as movers and shakers in the wide world. The narcissism, the inherent sexism, and the naive belief of the youth movement that they had discovered what no generation before them had ever known may be cringe-inducing now, but if you were there, it may bring back the ugly truth about an era that we now view through rose-colored glasses."
5,Down So Long,"Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)I used to own this book when I was just a young sprite (1968) but as often happens,I loaned it to someone and it was never returned.After many years,happened to be browsing through Amazon's catalogue and saw the book on offer and I decided to purchase it again.It's still the same fun story that i remembered from long ago and takes me back to much happier times.Thank you Amazon for a job well done.PS Delivery time was only two weeks instead of the six I was quoted and I'm very happy with that."
3,It Had It's Time,"This book, in conjunction with many others, was important to me as my mind underwent some desperately needed expansion in the sixties. As a social tool it had real value. Now, however, it must sink or swim on its artistic merit. Of which it has very little. There are funny spots but there are also goodly hunks of just plain garbage. Consider even the structural aspect that Gnossos is purported to be quite intelligent, ponders math equations, gets great grades and all that. But Farina should have known that neither he nor anyone else can sustain a character that is more intelligent than is the author himself. Which in this case dooms Gnossos to mediocrity."
3,Marred by poor quality recording,"I bought a copy of this video from a well-known music supplier (not Amazon), and have been very disappointed in the quality of the tape. There are two camera angles, one showing Kessler head on, one from the side. The soundtrack on the head-on shots is about half a second out-of-sync with the picture, which is annoying at the best of times but basically useless in a drumming video. Some of the shots are also poorly lit (over-exposed, rather than under exposed). Thinking it might be a faulty tape, I did get it exchanged - but the replacement is just the same. (Note: I am in the UK, but my VCR plays NTSC format, and it doesn't have a problem with other tapes from the US.) It's a useful video, but the production quality gets in the way."
4,Very helpful instructional video for Doumbek,"I found this video very helpful. I especially appreciate the time spent on developing time-sense. That's such a fundamental part of music, and Kessler has practical and entertaining suggestions for developing better rhythmic sense. I've been hand drumming for years, but mostly in informal drum circles and such. Having this video as a resource is going to save me alot on beginner lessons. 8-"
2,Only general information given,"I took the time to read the entire book. It is meant to be used as a reference guide, but could easily be read in a day. Overall, i give it 2 stars because it gives very little information. Even in photo's that the author changed, there was very little explination as to what and why X was done.The total meat of the book could have been written in 20 pages. The remaining 300 pages are used to repeat information, list available features in photoshop, but the author rarley explains anything that would help the ""Dummy""."
1,"Boring, boring",It seems every cliche ever written is in this drawn out tale that is unrealistic and uninteresting. Luckily my copy came from the library so no money was wasted...just time not well spent.
1,Total waste of money,"The book started out fairly well, but the amateurish writing really did start to get to me after awhile. The murders the story hinges around get dull and tiresome, and I actually began rooting for the unidentified killer to do away with Kate Paine, the undeveloped and boring heroine of the book. When finally learned who the culprit was, I had totally lost interest and felt that the author just pulled it out of a hat without any reason or logic. And there is nothing more annoying in books than the killer explaining to the victim (who is tied up and forced to listen to the obligatory rantings) all the reasons he has done such terrible deeds. For a better story, read ""The Firm"" by John Grisham, or ""The Job"" by Douglas Kennedy."
5,High Energy,"Oscar continues to produce. The masterful Sonero has brought together a fine selection of salsa and merengue tunes that can satisfy the soul as well as put fire in your feet. It comes highly recommended and is a lot of fun. It's what you want, isn't it? ENJOY!!!"
4,"latin fusion of salsa, latin jazz, and gozadera","Oscar has done it again. In this album, Oscar, unlike other salseros, combines salsa with latin jazz, and also gives a different perspective on merengue, and all while keeping it within the rhythms and sounds of ""salsa clasica"". ""Toitico Tuyo"" starts fast and blends into a more romantic salsa. I highly recomend it for dancing with your loved one."
1,Death Cage,"I wish I had read the online reviews here before purchasing this at PetSmart.Our pet mice are now dead, thanks to this gas chamber.The Down Under Dingo Home should not be sold as a stand-alone cage. Don't buy it unless you are connecting it with open access to another well-ventilated cage."
4,Great for mice!,"This is a great cage for one or two MICE of DWARF hamsters-but not for larger hamsters or garbles! I have had my cage for a few months now and it has been working really well for my single male mouse.Pros: Easy to clean, easy to take apart and put back together, the ""underground"" area for the mouse to sleep and burrow in is great and he really enjoys it, you can add other cages or accessories to this cage.Cons: Poop gets stuck between the 2 parts of the wheel and it must be taken completely apart to clean, the water bottle leaks, and unless your pet is people friendly, it can be difficult to get them out of the cage by means of the lid."
1,Don't buy this - will kill your hamster!,"I got a Robo Hamster and this cage last Friday.Initially, we were happy about this cage.But this water bottle didn't work! So, my hamster got dehydrated and died on Monday....This company specializes hamsters and small animals-- they should know better!I don't know how many hamsters has / will be suffered this kind of cage... but from my experience, use glass aquarium and high quality water bottle! Don't buy this cage! It'll kill your hamster!"
5,Tank is awesome...hood not so much!,I purchased this combo directly through PetCo. The tank looks awesome set up and is very sturdy and easy to clean. The hood for it however is not well made and the light bulb slips out easily when light is picked up to feed or clean the tank. I have an Oscar that regularly hits the top of the tank and hood and knocks it so the light bulb itself slides out and goes off. The screws don't tighten enough to hold the bulb in and the bulb itself doesn't lock in place like most fluorescent tank bulbs. I ended up getting a separate light strip to use and that works well.
5,Everything you will need when it comes to costs,"The table of contents alone gives an impression of how thoroughly this book covers all the aspects of managing costs in restaurants and food service operations. The book is also well organized and accessible - important concepts are clearly explained, and examples are well chosen. And it is also timely: no matter how attractive or imaginative your restaurant might be, controlling costs is critical to maintaining financial stability in a competitive environment.Here in a single, engaging volume is everything you are likely to encounter (and the answers too!) in keeping costs down and sales up. A recommended investment."
3,Good over view,"The book is good as an oveview on how to controll cost. It refreshes you mind on what the look outs are and try to make a good choice as to go for profit or cost, depending on the market.I will read it again just to refresh myself on controlls."
2,Legal Forms Review,I believe that this was poor because I along with many others who purchased this thought/under impression it would work with Windows Vista & Windows 7 & doesn't so we purchased it for nothing .
1,Roasting Pan - Commercial,"Having been in the restaurant business, I thought I was getting a good deal. When in fact the coating (not advertised) starting coming off with the 1st use. I would not buy this product again!"
5,Great product,Great roaster for the price. Cleans up easily and easy tp put in and out of oven. Rack works great
3,School book,I was required to get this book for class and found some of the information great. Most of the information was repetitive from previous lessons but it did a great job of breaking things down.
1,Hate it!,"Definitely not very comfortable! I don't know if this product was made for tall people or a certain body type. I'm 5'5"" and my daughter was approx. 17 lbs when I bought this product. I used it only once. I took it to the Zoo to give my daughter a better view of the animals. Wow, my back was killing after only an hour or so. I don't recommend it."
1,Poor quality,My daughter is 2 years old -- we received this carrier as a baby shower gift but didn't start using until last summer. I would guess that we've used it once a month for local hikes and then twice for week long vacations. The weight bearing straps that the adult wears have started to separate from the body of the carrier. My daughter weighs about 30 pounds ... well within the weight limit. Snugli (Evenflow) only provides a 90 day warranty on this item and won't do anything about it. We have a 6 month old too and I had hoped to be able to use this carrier for both kids but it seems unsafe as it is now. Stay clear of this product & look for a different backpack.
2,Belt Support Broken While Using,"I love this back pack design, but the belt support is clearly not as durable as it should be. I have owned it for a few months, but only used it about 10 times around the house. My son is about 20 lbs and there has been no extreme use or wear and tear. There is a plastic flat piece that is the back middle of the belt support. It has holes stamped in it to allow the belt support to be raised or lowered. As I was walking with my son, I pulled to tighten the belt and the whole plastic part split in half. This left the entire belt support split in half (see customer photo). I will be contacting Evenflo for a replacement and will update this review based on their support."
3,Evenflo Snugli Cross Terrain Carrier Silver/Charcoal,"We were very happy with this carrier until on the 3rd or 4th use, one of the front clasps on the waist belt broke. So now it is entirely useless until I find a way to replace this clasp which will probably require replacing both to make sure they fit together properly. More work than I signed up for on a new item!!"
3,"Too Big, Too Heavy","This product was a good concept...being able to carry baby and supplies, but it is far too heavy on a small framed person. I am 5'2"" and felt this pack was designed for a much bigger person since the contours on the back dont quite fit me. At 8.5 pounds, it weighs almost as much as a stroller! For a quick trip to the store or market, you are better off with a smaller backpack.(such as the ""Tough Traveler"") I never took mine out of the house because I really thought I'd hurt myself. I felt that it was just too top heavy with the baby in it. My husband, who is 5'8"" and considerably stronger than I am, used it once, but he too felt this backpack was too heavy. What a waste. I will probably sell mine on Ebay."
5,This is the one!,"I have been doing quite a bit of shopping around for a backpack carrier and this is definitely the one. I found the Kelty backpacks to be extremely heavy. Other simpler backpacks are not comfortable for my baby. This one is the perfect combination of comfort for me and my baby. I was originally going to buy the Snugli Cross Country backpack because it was less expensive, but when I tried them both on, I found this one was much better. The straps on the Snugli Cross Country do not have as much cushion and they feel like they are digging into your shoulders. My husband found the hip belts to be much more supportive on the Cross Terrain. I am 5'2"" and my husband is 6' and we both wear it comfortably. Happy Trails!"
4,not quite what I'd expected,"I was looking for an around-town carrier. I think this is really more of a hiking backpack. I find it too bulky and large for just going to the store or something. And it's not terribly comfortable, either. In it's defense I must say my daughter loves it."
2,"One big flaw, baby has no where to rest his head","I bought and returned this right away because I have an old version of an evenflo frame carrier that is all plastic and very light and has a nice padded bumper for baby to rest his head if it lolls forward or to the sides. This model has no bumper and so when baby falls asleep he doesn't look comfortable. Otherwise big draws include supportive waist strap and canopy. Under 8 lbs is ok, but under 6 lbs would be a winner."
5,All-around satisfactory,"We were first attracted by this carrier because of the price. We have used it many times, it is light and sturdy. I don't see what more expensive carriers could do more or better."
2,BEWARE OF SHOULDER PAIN!,"Initially, I thought a great purchase, but after an hour with a 20 lb. baby on my back - my upper shoulders and neck starting to kill me! It feels like a bar is stabbing me across my shoulder blades - I simply can't take wearing this thing for more than 30 minutes. The baby was safe and comfortable, but the wearer has to walk hunched forward, as it's a weird center of gravity shift. Maybe it's because I'm 5'4"" and my husband is over 6 feet tall - but we both agreed that chiropractors should be the only people pushing this product - as it will definitely increase business for them! Buy something else - skip this product."
2,returned it after 2 weeks,"We had search on the web for a while before we made the trip to overseas, and before we went for our trip a month ago, we bought the Cross Terrain Carrier, we would say that the price is reasonable as it is so many pads surround me, and my hubby. My daughter loves to sit inside it as well. However, the bottom support is very weak, even my daughter is only 21 lbs, it is difficult to secure, so my daughter always falls into the bottom of the carrier, that makes her arms very sore. Also, after 2 weeks, the back support nylon tore apart... RIGHT BEFORE OUR TRIP.... we became very upset and return it to Babyrus right away. Finally, we have to use stroller and normal infant carrier instead.. if anyone can find another good product, please share opinion as we will have another overseas trip at X'mas time this year.."
3,It just didn't fit,"This was an excellent product in every way except for the fit. It had awesome features, lots of padding, pretty lightweight - cute colors, too. But it was too tight across my chest (I'm breastfeeding, but not a large busted woman) and the shoulder straps rested on a tender area. I just tried it for about ten minutes in my home and had to take it off. I've been using a front pack for months and also use a backpack diaper bag, so I'm used to carrying weight on my shoulders (baby weighs 20+ lbs.) It was just a bad fit for me. I'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs. Hope this helps..."
2,Good if for younger smaller child,"The product claims to carry children up to 40 lbs. my daughter is only 27lbs. and it could not hold her. While it has all the pockets and looks like the higher end carriers it is not. After one day at the amusement park the straps started to strain and seperate fromt he carrier. I returned this item and got the Sherpani Rumba which has a wight limit of 70lbs. I love it.Also, the cross terrain claim to "" Load balancing straps distributes weight off parent's shoulder and onto hips"" it does not. I was in horrible pain after about an hour. in both my upper and lower back. I suggest you don't waste your money and go with the higher end products like Sherpani and Kelty.This will work for a smaller child, but only if you can compfortably carry the weight. I did like the easily adjustable seat and back. I was able to adjust from my height to my husbands."
5,Great Tuna!,"I ordered a case of all three flavors Amazon offers. All were wonderful! It's about the same liquid to fish ratio as standard tuna, except instead of water you pour down the sink, you get very well seasoned sauces. The ""Sweet Chili"" flavor features a very nice chili taste with a sweet finish and very little heat. 170-calories (give or take)per can. Throw in some mini carrote and a few crackers, and you have a very satisfying meal for very few calories. The price is great too!"
5,tunalicious,I have to say I never knew anything about Safcol tuna.And I must say I missed out on alot of there great variety of tunas.But alas not anymore.
1,tuna with a sickly sweet taste....,After trying some of the bumblebee flavored tunas and a few of the starkist ones I really hoped that this would be as good. I was wrong. To start out with the tuna in the can is not even close to the others quality. The other brands are more of a fillet stamped out and canned. This is tiny chuncks crammed into a can with a sickly sweey sauce. I would guess it is about 60% tuna 40% sauce. I like sweet chili sauce.... I like tuna.... I dont like this though.UPDATE: --- I thought I had come up with a good way to get rid of this tuna. I would feed it to my dog. My dog (which loves tuna) just refused to eat this. I guess she would rather eat dogfood than this product!
1,Not For My Taste,"I had high hopes for this product, especially since the calorie count and fat content are very good. However, I ended up being disappointed. The tuna is not as dense and packed much wetter than other brands. I also did not like the favor, which I found more sweet rather than chili sauce. The sweet chili flavor was not for my taste. I donated the remainder of the case to the local food bank."
2,Just not the same,"I got this CD cheap somewhere, mainly because of the dearly departed Rob Fisher, who I knew from Naked Eyes. This CD isn't bubble gum but it is watered-down saccharin pop and lacks substance. Climie Fisher is a different animal from Naked Eyes. Like NE, CF had just two studio albums and scant chart success. Simon Climie is best known these days for producing Michael McDonald's ""Motown"" one and two, as well as writing tracks for Amy Grant and Vanessa Williams.Released on EMI outside North America."
5,your adolelescent,"very interesting book helped me immensley understanding how to approach my teenage son regarding topics which are quite sensitive for him,"
2,Becareful,"I own a srt8 charger, install was suppose to be simple but... The bolts that came with the spacer where to long causing one of the bolts to snap in the intake manifold. I now have to drill out a stainless steel bolt which of course I didn't have the bids so had to buy that and the easy out to remove the bolt so use different bolts or add a couple washers cause a manifold cost about 700 dollars for the charger and it's not fun on the bright side I was averaging about 12.9 mpg I'm at 14.1 now"
2,Corporate Repentance,"This book gives to every Christian a very good explanation of why Jesus has not yet come. The sinner finds comfort here, and the Jew finds that he can safely kneel down next to the Christian who believes in the concept of corporate repentance. The Christian sees himself as having done worse in the name of Christ than the Jew did against Him. A truly healing book for both Jews and Christians although written for the SDA church."
5,Excellent Game!,"This is a wonderful game for the people who enjoyed the series. You can lift, Fight, battle in LFOs, and enjoy an awesome prequel storyline. It fills in some blanks from the anime series and is overall a very enjoyable game."
2,"Ok, but not the very best","The very best of Wayman Tisdale, was ok, but truly not the very best. I did purchase other cds by Wayman, and would highly recommend those as well. This would be my 3rd choice, not first choice."
5,So Smooth,It seems like what ever song Wayman plays it's Magical the saying goes in 2 notes a person should be able to tell who's playing and you difintly know it's Wayman he was the Master of Bass Players.
4,very good music RIP,RIP to a Very Talented Brother who could play Ball on the Court and he made a name for himself on Bass as a Musician in the Smooth Jazz field. this collection showcases his talents and the sharp arrangements he was doing. He made a name for himself and he did so much in such a short period of time. he was a Class Act.
2,ON THE BUSES,"First of three feature length movies that were adapted from the popular British 1970's sitcom and is easily the best. The film is entertaining along the way but again it comes across as one long ponderous extended T.V sketch. The basic plot line revolves around a bunch of women bus drivers causing the male bus drivers outrage with the men believing that women are not up to being bus drivers. Ususal double entrendes and comic misunderstanding but the sexist treatment of the script handicapps the film slightly with it coming across as very dated. However Reg varney and Anna karen sparkle in their roles and have some of the funniest lines to deliver. Apart from that it's enjoyably about average. If you asked me the same question about 15 years ago, I would have said excellent, but it's now just innocent, old fashioned fun and games. Recommended to fans of the series."
4,On The Buses,"This was the first British TV comedy to be made into a full length feature film. It has all the ingredients not to be politically correct, but it is classic comedy. The Inspector (Blakey) decides to take on women bus drivers to help the short staffed Luxton and District Bus Company. No overtime for the male bus crews means plans are afoot to cause problems for Blakey and the women drivers. The film has some of the best gags in it from the classic TV Series. On The Buses fan club is alive and well."
3,On the Buses,"This is the first of three films made after the success of the television series. The Town and District bus depot has a shortage of Bus crews, the depot inspector decides the only sollution is to employ female bus drivers. This causes hilarious results with the male staff. Stars Reg Varney as Stan, Bob Grant as Jack, Stephen Lewis as Inspector Blake and Doris Hare as mum."
3,"Good camera, but not perfect","I've waited two years to write my review so that I'd be removed from the excitement that comes with buying a new camera. The strongpoints of this camcorder are its size, color reproduction, remote control, and adjustable light/color settings. It's drawbacks are: poor performance in low/med-low light conditions. The colors tend to go blue in mid to low light situations, and that can be annnoying for those trying to make short films with different locations/lighting. I think that this camera would be a great buy for someone looking to do a lot of serious filming in outdoor areas. If you just want something to make home movies of your kids or something, then I'd go for a cheaper model Panasonic or a Sony. I think that I'm going to buy a Sony next time because I like their low-light features."
2,Tape transport noise,"The camcorder I bought suffers from noise in the tape transport mechanism (a purring noise that makes the camera sound like an 8mm projector and gets recorded on tape). Serching on the web you find more references to the PV-GS400 but it can be present on the other GS models. Search for ""Panasonic tape transport noise""."
4,PV-GS120,"Even though this camera came out a few years ago, I still prefer it over many later models. It's easy to use, well made, and being able to have a mini dv tape for an archive collection is important. I highly recommend it."
4,Best camcorder under $800,"Panasonic out did themselves by releasing two 3CCD camcorders below the $1000 price point (the other being the PV-GS200). No other consumer DV cam boasts 3CCDs, and the difference in image quality really shows. Getting a similar image quality from any other brand of DV cam requires spending at least $1500. The only reason I gave this camcorder 4 stars instead of 5 is because the battery life is far too short. Even with an extra battery, this camcorder beats out everything in the same price range from Canon, Sony, JVC, etc."
4,C'mon People,"Whether or not it comes with a firewire cable is of no importance. I don't believe any of these DV cams come with one. Just spend $20 to buy a kit that comes with a firewire card, a firewire cable and entry-level editing software. Enough said.Now, in terms of quality, from my first observations I've gotten good video. Outdoors these digital cams are all good. This one will have better color rendition and won't blow out highlights as much, due to its 3 CCDs. Not as high resolution as some, but I doubt one can tell in the final image. Indoors it's better than most other consumer DV cams, which actually isn't saying much. It has less grain and more color than the others, but still isn't great. You have to spend $2,000 to get a digital camcorder that does well in low light. The GS120 automatically turns off the electronic image stabilization in low light, which helps with low light but makes for shakey video if you zoom in."
4,stylistic departure from earlier work,"""Sleepwalkers"" marks a dramatic departure in music style from Daly's heavy-guitar driven debut album ""Fight The Fuzz Bars."" Opting for a lighter feel, ""Sleepwalkers"" is comprised of a dozen dreamy ballads played out to a more techno-organic score. While I must admit to being a bigger guitar fan than digital keyboard fan, the songwriting in ""Sleepwalkers"" is certainly a step ahead from ""Fuzz Bars."" The lyrics to songs like ""She,"" ""Dizzy,"" ""Still Small Voice,"" and ""Molasses Kiss,"" are poetic giving this album a more optimistic outlook by the last song's finish."
3,Good not great,"Honour was dissapointing as it marked my switch to DVD from VHS in the series. I agree sound and picture quality are poor. This series is crying out for a repackaging in a DVD box set with digital quality and behind-the-scenes stuff. That said, Honour is fairly entertaining. A good plot and some decent action, along with the traditional kick-to-the-groin fight scenes. The climatic battle sees Sean Bean catapulted over over a downed cart, sword in hand. Great stuff that. The romance is downplayed a bit, with one exception (""He was at her all night sir"") and the scene where Sharpe rescues the Marquesa from the band of nuns is hilarious. Worth the time. I'm looking forward to getting further into the series from this point on."
2,Dummy Book,I don't like to book. Spends more time trying to be cute than helpful.The asides and comments don't help you to better understand the program.
1,Fish Killer,"After using this product, right away I noticed a reaction with my Goldfish. I have (had) two and the one was affected more then the other. Did a water change and they seemed better. A few weeks later I used it again and then I lost the one fish. For the last few days, even after 2 partial water changes my lone goldfish is VERY stressed and going crazy. Today I'm doing another 2/3 water change and hoping for the best...Google ""Algaefix and goldfish"" and read some of the reviews you find there. Some folks think this product should be banned, and I agree wholeheartedly!"
4,Very Good Idea,"My sister bought this for my daughter about a year ago, and at first, she wouldn't use it. Then I bought a few more cartridges like Winnie The Pooh, and Cinderella, and now she loves it!! She changes the cartridges by herself, and sits and plays for hours."
1,I pity the world of music today,"Is this what the word ""music"" has degenerated into? I pity the state of music today. This is not music. All this..... ""music"" is (it's not music, by the way) is a bunch of bad synthesizer work coupled with ridiculous lyrics. The lyrics are an attempt to be funny like Ween, but they are...... i can't even think of a word to describe them. Cheesy? Childish? Not enough. I gave this album 1 star because I can't give it stars in the negative numbers. This is not music. I STRESS, this is NOT music. I would highly suggest you get another album, by another group/band/artist."
4,"not his best, but his third best","this is a pretty kickass album. i personally suggest and earlier album, but if youre wanting some songs with guitars and drums in them, this may be for you. buy it."
5,Excellent,Atom and His package is my god i worship him nightly. i want all my children to grow up like this honorable individual
4,"Some of his best, but overall a little uneven","There is some great stuff on here. First off, people who like atom will love this (especially the atom and his rockage songs they sound so great), and the people who hate him will continue to hate him (but they won't be able to resist the above mentioned Rockage songs). This album contains some of his best song writing, but we see why a few of the songs were unreleased. This CD overall I like better than ""A Society of People Named Elihu"" but just barely... Recommended to all fans, and for newcomers this is the best place to start."
1,This book is a disgrace to the Christian community.,"None of the authors ever were Reconstructionists and have demonstrated their appalling scholarship by deliberatly misquoting their adversaries and by making things up, essentially bearing false witness. They have changed words around in quoting their sources and they have gotten names and backgrounds all wrong. This book is a disgrace to the Christian community and should never have been published."
3,Brackets a bit flimsy,"I was a bit disapointed in the brackets supplied with this product and the fact that there are no groves or pockets in the rubber gaskets to retain the grease. The product installed okay on my RV and have held up for a 3000 mile trip to Colorado but I am concerned they will not hold up long term. These were one of the very few options I was able to find that fit my 1.375"" sway bar. The standard for most vehicles is 1"" or less. I guess the larger bar was installed because of the extra weight on the RV.Performance wise, the product seems to work well. I hit heavy winds in NM for hours on end and the RV stayed on the road well."
5,"Classic kits, Classic reviews",I picked up Cult's book at WonderFest with egar anticipation. What was contained in the book did not dissapoint. It was filled with great kits I never knew existed (& now want) as well as great ideas & tips on building them. I can't say enough about this book & how it will help me build a better kit.
2,Not Bluegrass,"This album calls itself a bluegrass tribute, but it isn't bluegrass. At best, it's country unplugged with only acoustic instruments. I was disappointed in that every song on the album sounds like every other song on the album. And all the songs are ballads. There are no hard-driving bluegrass songs here at all. Bluegrass is all about the ""high lonesome sound"" (at least, according to Bill Monroe, who invented the genre) but there isn't any high lonesome harmony on the album. Call it country if you want, but don't call it bluegrass."
5,Review as a 3 year Table Tennis Coach of a top school!,"I constantly train lower school, middle and Upper school kids to play Table Tennis and I must say these are a blast to have around. Kids, even older ones are actually fighting over certain colors, I actually have to remove them for good!Bounce Consistency (7/10)-They are one star balls from a generally recreation-producing company. Don't expect professional world-wide quality but it is decent to hit around. Great to use on robots and for beginner play.Durability (8/10)-Hey! They last pretty long! Not to mention getting all scratched up and stepped on, but in general it should last a few weeks.Overall (8/10)-Again, they're great, long lasting and perfect for having fun. Some colors however are difficult to see, like dark purple or bright yellow. I play professionally and I can honestly say I cannot even see some of the colors on the ball moving super slow, or even 100 mph. But for kid's and recreation sake they work well."
4,Review by a Mom,"I bought this game for my son so he could duel on his own. He spends a lot of time with the game, it is his new favorite, so it must be pretty good. It looks a little boring to me, but I am not really into dueling."
1,I think not,"This game was so boring when it came out. It was all hyp nothing more. the AI still sucks, the cards you get suck even the whole RPG theme it has going sucked. Like one someone said you get your first starter deck and you think your ready to go nope, some little loser starts bothing you and telling you that the cards in your deck aren't meant for dueling so you have to discard them from your deck. The game is slow the whole thing about resting is boring , dueling a dog is stupid and i still wonder why we're still useing some guy we dont even know. The guy has goku hair if you look at it, im serious. But over all the game is a waste of money. If you want to dish out cash you might as well send it to me."
1,It's inspiring to see how far she's come since Burning.,"I loved Le Divorce, which I found absolutely compelling and gracefully written. So, like many others, I went and read some of Johnson's other works; I bought Burning to reward myself for completing my last final exam. What a gyp. The book is clumsy, disorganized, lacking in focus. The characters are poorly drawn and unconvincing (and worse, so forgettable that it's hard to keep track of who's who), and the plot just meanders pointlessly. But you should read it if you want to become a professional writer, because if you compare this to Le Divorce you have no choice but to conclude that even the most unpromising works can give way to later triumphs."
3,Early Johnson,"This early novel by Diane Johnson uses as its setting the California upper-class housing development; its characters are the eccentric post-hippies and pre-yuppies who migrated there in the 1970's. The story covers the events of one day in broad social comedy that still contains seeds of incisive insights into the dynamics of marital relationships. It examines in a sometimes successfully comic way the Kafka-esque bureaucracy of child welfare services, the madness of some medical practitioners, the alienation of suburbanites, the disaffection of the drug addicted. The book is not as refined, subtle, or enriching as ""Le Divorce,"" but then ""Burning"" was a product of an author nearly 30 years younger. Probaby best for ardent fans of Johnson."
4,Great Overview of Evel's Career,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Evel Knievel was the ultimate showman. He was the idol and hero of many children. This great DVD shows every great jump he had ever done on ABC'S Wide World Of Sports. The interviews on this documentary are from the 80's, and we get to see Robbie Knievel, before he became a daredevil star as well.The one thing that has always amazed me about Knievel is that he refuses to quit and lie down. Even today at 69 years old as he fights his many health problems, he chooses to remain, a fighter and stay positive.Truly, no other daredevil has entertained us as Knievel has. The title says it best, he is the last of the gladiators."
3,decent clippers,"works well, could come with more attachments, and would be nice if the battery held its charge longer."
5,Excellent Product,"This was purchased to replace a cordless Wahl. It's definitely and much superior in every way. It doesn't bog-down like the Wahl and is nearly as light. My wife cuts my hair and needed a small and light clipper. This really fit the bill. The clip-on guards fit quite tightly and are a little tricky to remove until you get the hang of it.Overall, a superior product at a reasonable price."
4,Nice product at a good price.,"This is a high quality clipper that does a nice job. It is pretty powerful and comes with a nice asortment of cutting guides. The range of the adjustable blade isn't as wide as advertised, but the spacing of the teeth on the cutting guides is close enough to do a nice job."
4,Panasonic ER153A Ultra Light Professional Hair Clipper,Panasonic ER153A Ultr Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7) (Hardcover).a Light Professional Hair Clipper
1,WORTHLESS,"I honestly CANNOT recommend this book. There are few hints within the book and there are tons of mistakes. If one looks through the first practice exam, the answers in the back are incorrect. There are also tons of misspelling. Also, this test is definately not a good gauge for the MCAT. It is WAY TOO EASY! If you got the extra $ by all means go for it, but I mean you'll be very very disappointed with this book."
2,Easier than the real thing,These tests are nice confidence boosters but not an accurate guage of the actual MCAT. I found the passages tamer and questions easier than the real thing. The answers are a bit skimpy on details too. I also think their scoring chart is a little generous - deduct two points (per section) from theirs to get a better idea of how you'd have fared if it'd been the real thing.
1,not worth buying,"This book is not really indicative of the real MCAT I took. It's great if you want to gain some confidence before the test but the sample tests are too simple. This book is really contradictory to the Princeton classes b/c everything in there is really hard. Overall, I wouldnt recommend neither the class nor this book. If you must, take Kaplan or buy a bunch of practice tests and just work on them. I increased my score from a 14 to a 32 after taking about 20+ practice exams over the course of 6 months. It's about stamina and strategy and lots of science knowlege."
1,Not as pictured,I have seen this book with the same picture on the front cover and a few pictures throughout the book. I thought that was what I was buying however this picture is misleading as a plain blue covered book arrived with no pictures through the story. Of course the story was all there but I was disappointed not to find any artwork.
2,Yuck. . .I'm -not- impressed!,"Well, I got to reading this after I had seen the touring ""The Phantom of the opera"" in my hometown. Well, I was screaming in rage 1 day later as I finished the book. The phantom had no heart what-so-ever and was the cruelest thing in the whole Paris Opera House! I wanted to rip this book apart! He was a monster, inside and out. Well, in the musical, I suppose you don't notice his monster side because of his voice. . .but still, that's not the idea!"
5,A Haunting Tale by One of the Greatest Writers EVER!!!!!!!!,"I read this almost immediately after I saw the Lloyd-Webber play. I was astounded and haunted. The way Leroux writes, how he portrays not only the cold-blooded murderer side of Erik but the human side that needed to be loved, simply floored me. I wish that more of his books were available to the public, since only this book and his Mystery in the Yellow Room are presently available. I hope Amazon gets hold of them soon!!!! This book also goes very well with Susan Kays book Phantom, which gives a more complete background of Erik. If you like The Phantom of the Opera, read Phantom!!!!!"
5,"""The Opera Ghost was real.""","""Based"" on a true story, Leroux gets some things right and some things wrong. I should know, I was there. The powerful love story of an airheaded aristocrat, a young, confused, innocent soprano, and a musical genius/madman with the face of a demon and the voice and heart of an angel, the ending drives me to tears every time I read it. At least Leroux got one thing right: ""The Opera Ghost was real."""
4,A Surprisingly Good Book,"This summer, for my AP English IV class, I am forced into reading classic literature. Frightening, but true. ""Phantom"" was one of the books on my reading list, and I found it to be surprisingly good. It did have its boring parts, and Raoul is incredibly stupid, in his own blundering male way; not to mention Christine: who would really be that gullable? That aside, one has to love the rat catcher and the man in the hooded cape who wanders the Paris Opera, not to mention Eric's torture chamber. Leroux really gives life to the Paris Opera House and the characters who inhabit it, creating a very strange and secretive place where one can easily believe a man could hide undetected for years. I finished this book with a sigh of gratitude to the gods that it wasn't mental torture and quickly moved on to a paperback romance novel, he he. Now I have to read Earnest Hemingway. Argh."
4,"Great book, hard to read",This book was really good and was worth buying it. But it's hard to read unless you have time on you hands to go over it a couple times.
1,Something Wrong...,"I was also sent the children's version as opposed to the one shown. I am talking with the seller at the moment but it is clear that the ISBN matches the one in listing, but it still isn't the same book as shown. Buyer beware, sellers tend to just list by ISBN (as I have done with used textbooks in the past) and I noticed that there is another review complaining of the same mistake. Now, I'm afraid to try to purchase book again despite it being one of my favourites in fear I will waste my money on an error again."
3,Translation please?,"Just so no one throws anything at me, first I would like to say that Leroux's ""Phantom"" is absolutely fabulous. That said this translation is terrible compared to a couple of others out there. The original translation took place many decades ago, back when it was ok to change the original author's meaning to suit the translator. Much of the wonderful characterization and beautiful language were lost due to this problem. If you liked this novel or even if you didn't, I would like to recommend reading the translation by Lowell Bair instead. He seems to retain much more of the original author's meaning."
5,Very Good Translation,"I first read Leroux's Phantom of the Opera years ago, but I remember thinking at the time that the book seemed a little flat. I decided to try this translation (hey, it was free, so why not), and found it to be a much richer and more readable version of the book. A lot of nuances that just weren't there in the original paperback I'd read came out in this one. There are some weird formatting glitches here and there, but they don't take away from the strength of the narrative or the classic story of love and obsession."
4,None of the flair and pace of the later adaptations....,"If you are looking for a faced paced gothic/horror/romance that will keep you turning page after page -- this is not the book for you. If you are a fan of classic literature, especially with a gothic or theatric twist you will find it more interesting. It is also worth it for the die-hard fans of the movie or Broadway versions of the tale. To me, as a fan Webber's musical version, I enjoy the original book almost as if it is a set of footnotes, documents, and details that never make it on stage."
4,"Excellent book, horrifying editing","Shame on the editor of this book! The incredible research that went into this book is belittled by the fact that it is not very well written. Spelling and grammatical errors abound in this otherwise-excellent volume. This is the only book I own from this series; I sincerely hope that these problems were absent in other titles.Other than that, I can say that this is the definitive book about Chaney's Phantom. Facts in this book are repeated in the ""ultimate edition"" 2-disc DVD, which includes the best-they-could-do of the 1925 original, which eluded the original authors of this book.Regardless of my own personal pickiness, if you are a fan of silent films and/or Chaney's Phantom, please get this book. It's a wonderfully immersive read."
4,A book to read over and over,I became fascinated with The Phantom of the Opera when I watched a 20th anniversary documentary on the making of the broadway musical. This is a book that appears can be read over and over again! Each time the reader would come away with some new gem!
5,Brilliant,This book was filled with atmosphere and feeling and made me want to read on to find out why things were happening. One of my favourite books ever.
5,Very good book,"I really loved this book. Leroux really described everything in maticulous detail, so I felt as though I was there. The gripping story of Christine Daae' and the Phantom who loves her but can't have her cause me to be unable to put it down. Read it, it is very good."
5,the most AWESOME book,The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux is an awesome book. I couldn't put it down!! i loved the fact that the author went to so much trouble as to explore the Paris Opera house. His exploraion truly made the boko make more sence. If he hadn't of gone into so much trouble as to explain the floor plan of the opera house i would have been totaly lost. His charaters are amazing. it is a true masterpiece.i can not say how good it is. my advice to you is that if you haven't read it you deffently should!!!!
3,maybe i shouldve read the book before seeing the movie.,i saw the movie but decided to read the book...ehhh.. hard to get into. didnt like the beginning at all. to confusing. read the book before the movie. seriously.
5,Awesome book!,"This book was AWESOME! I'm up for mystery-typed stuff and it's one of the best classics I've read! Of course, as usual, the beginning started out boring, but it caught my interest fast as the plot grew. OF course, ERIK was my fav character... he's a murderer, yes, but he has this sort of.. childlike 'aura' that made me not feel angry at what he did, but feel compassion for him and a bit of justification for his action. yeah, that's a little crazy, but it's true! I kinda wish that Erik had been real! I'd listened to him ::snicker::"
5,Pick it up... you won't be able to put it down!,"This must be the best book I've read in a while. Once I started it, I was cut off from this world. The plot is simple yet really entertaining. It doesn't state too many extra details and doesn't tell a few different stories at once like many other books. I am a person who often needs to reread some sentences again and again before I get them, but this one went almost completely smoothly. It must be considered a classic. Once I started reading it I was so enthralled that I felt like all the characters at one point in the book. It's kinda spooky, but not as much as many other books, just enough to make you continue reading. Please excuse the spelling, it is very late at night."
3,Not as good as expected,"I was disappointed by the book, but maybe I was expecting much more given that this is an immortal classic. The writing style of Leroux seemed to me too informal and even inconsistent, but the story is entertaining and even when the characters behave all like little kids quarreling (and Christine has to be the most irritating bimbo in literature) the book is enjoyable."
4,"Tense, Readable, Uncertain","This is a readable and oft-gripping version of Mr. Leroux's famous tale. The ingredients are here for a fun read - mystery, intrique, love, danger, difficult choices, etc., all set at the Paris Opera in the early 20th Century. Readers follow along as Raoul competes for the lovely Christine Daae against the disfigured phantom who also loves her, and who taught her the craft that she now performs so flawlessly. We see the bodies pile up, experience the mystery of box 5, and feel the grip of fear haunting the opera. Perhaps the climax occurs when Raoul and the Persian's search the cellars, keeping one hand up and never knowing what trick will next befall them. Reading this novel for the first time I enjoyed the mystery and intrigue, yet felt like something was missing - the ending seemed somewhat unreasonable. Perhaps one needs to peruse the full version for better understanding. Despite uncertainty, this is an interesting, readable tale of mystery and intrigue."
4,The one that started it all.,"A captivating love story, and Leroux's surprisingly modern style was much easier to read than I expected. This volume contains much more character background than the movies/musical do, but still leaves the reader wanting more. If you're a fan of the Phantom, I also highly recommend Susan Kay's ""Phantom"", which does Leroux's story justice."
3,Satisfied with customer service,The vendor actually sent a wrong item - children's book instead of the barnes and noble collection. But when I emailed them they responded in a timely manner and refunded via amazon gift card. I'm satisfied with the vendor's customer service.
3,Not what I expected...but VERY good.,"This book, I thought was just a ""monster"" book. I remember the old shows and hearing people talk about the story. And not to mention the actual Operas that have been made of it.It is actualy a very good story, not hokey, or cheesy as most of the movies would leed you to believe.It simply is a love story, not only about a man a woman ...and another man. But about a man who just wants to be loved, to feel wanted, to feel needed and to be remembered.It flows very smooth and is an easy read. Gaston did a great job."
5,Facinating.,"Really, what makes this so fascinating, is the fact that it is based of true events. I have seen the play, and watched the movie..the play is better. But sadly, they are not going to be touring the phantom any more.. I'm glad that I got to see it...if only once.."
3,Mainly of historical value,"If you are a fan of the Phantom on stage or on screen, then you really ought to read this book. Everyone should know the sources of the things they are interested in.With that said, compared to the sources of other legendary horror films (particularly the original Dracula and Frankenstein novels) this book does not hold up well as a piece of literary art. It is largely a melodrama, the equivalent of today's Grisham or Steele novel. Though it doubtless had entertainment value in its time, it is rather dated to modern eyes."
3,I expected more,"I love this story and have seen the stage production twice. When I started Gaston Leroux's story, I expected it to be spectacular, but it was written more in the style of one of the author's newspaper articles than a novel. I didn't get much sense of the character's ""inner lives""."
3,"Poorly written, but still a good read","Although the story was rather engaging, The approach Leroux takes in narrating his story is sorely lacking. He wrote the story from the point of view of an investigative journalist--a third person limited point of view. There are places in his novel, however, where he refers to what ""he thinks"" or ""Christine thought,"" which means that the narrator is really third person omniscient! In this regard the novel was poorly written, but all in all, I had fun reading it and would recommend it to others."
4,Interesting and quirky mystery...,"I just returned from Paris where I visited the Opera house in which the Phantom of the Opera story is set. I also re-read the novel as a precursor to my visit. The main thing I can tell you about this story is that, to me, the Opera house itself is the main attraction of this story. The story itself is not all that great, although interesting and fairly original in its execution.As I wandered the labyrinthian halls of the Opera I definitely benefitted by having re-read the book, since it gave me all kinds of secret fantasies about the building and secret passageways. If you get the chance to go to Paris you must see this building!!! Next time I think I'll bring my copy of the book along and sit in a quiet corner of the Opera house and read!"
3,The book that started it all,"Leroux's legacy, it is a lasting masterpierce. However I had the (mis)fortune of reading Susan Kay's lamentably better version before the original.While this is a wonderful story, Kay's is better (my opinion, not the final word!). So perhaps I am somewhat flawed in my opinion. ""The most tragic of grown up fairy tales"" I once said in a book report, and it still holds true. If you're a real phan of Erik, you simply must read this.Enjoyed the musical? read this. Like a good book? read this. Love falling in love with seductive, dark, mysterious men who can sing like nobodies business? Read this!As I once read, we are all obsessed (subconsciously) by sex and death; and the Phantom embodies both. So everyone should enjoy this on some level. Unless you're some freak who is internally unbalanced and lives in a cellar, serenading innocent chorus girls with your manipulative voice. :P"
3,A reasonable choice,"I picked up this copy of Phantom on a whim while at the bookstore and while I do not regret the decision, this book does have some flaws.There are numerous typographical errors in the text of an obvious nature which do not detract from the story per se, but do make it less enjoyable to read. The annotations are well placed and informative but can become repetitive as their author harps on the basic characterizations of Raoul and Erik. The illustrations are over inked for the coarseness of the paper and can be somewhat unpleasant to look at.If you are a casual reader, you may not want this edition. However, if you are more interested in the history of the book and the Opera House it depicts than the text itself, this is a copy worth purchasing."
3,The Opera ghost really existed,"The Opera ghost really existed....That is how Gaston LeRoux starts his story and by the end of the book, you too believe Erik (the Phantom) exists. I found it hard to say if this book is a mystery or a romanace but it is a good read. It really goes into the moral that true beauty comes from within and though very different from a similar tale, Beauty and the Beast, the moral is the same. It is the story that Andrew Lloyd Webber based his musical on, so if you loved that you will enjoy this book."
5,The story I'd been looking for!,"This book is an absolute must have for both musical theatre and classic literature lovers! I am both. Gaston Leroux took a ghost story and turned it into the best love/horror story ever written. From it's beutiful and mysterious plot line to characters you wish were real, ""Phantom"" is a book you will never forget. If you've seen the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, read the remarkable book that inspired it. By the way...Erik, if you're out there? I'm here and waiting!"
5,"Pain, true love, and forgivness","That's the summary of this book right there. I just watched the silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera, and I am so glad that I read the book first. The Phantom is portrayed as cruel in all of the Hollywood movies, yet if you read this book, Erik is much more than that. You see the obsession he had for Christine turn into true love as he lets her go out of his life just top make her happy. You'll heart will tear in two when you read this book of mystery and romance. And for more insite into Erik's soul and life read Phantom by Susan Kay."
4,Can't beat a classic,"You can't beat reading a good olde classic, this is the third-or-so time reading it and I can never get over the fact that this is sort-of based on a true story/legend I love this book. Keep reading - Sarah"
5,My favorite book..,"Sure, I love the broadway version, but Leroux's book is loved a million times more in my heart. There is an explanation as to why things are done, and the story just makes much more sense. And Leroux's writing is so descriptive and thoguth through, that it seems almost impossible to capture it on stage. I read this book in 7th grade, and I cried my eyes out. Beautiful."
5,Great for all Phantom nuts,"This is the one that started the whole Phantom Phad!This book is totally out of this world!! You must get it, even if you are not a Phantom Phreak like I am.Gaston Leroux sure wrote a great book! The story is suspenseful and thrilling, and at the end it is so sad that when I read it I cried. You just can't help but feel very sorry for the poor Phantom(whose real name is Erik).If some of the chapter names confuse you, you're not alone. I was baffled, too. The titles are REAL long, such as "" The Continuation Of The Singular Behavior Of A Safety Pin"", instead of just ""The Safety Pin"". I guess that's how people wrote their books in 1911.This book is wonderful, and you should get it, even if you've never heard about Phantom of the Opera before! You'll love it from the first chapter to the last."
5,Erik touched me in a way no other man ever could.,"<I>The Phantom of the Opera</I> isn't just a book, it's my bible. Don't misunderstand me, I don't mean that it was divinely inspired, but for me, Erik stands as a neo-pagan archetype, a tragic hero, a powerful god who, as stated by Leroux, had a heart that could have held the world, but to escape His persecuters, had to content Himself instead with a cellar. Christine Daae was a fool who was unworthy of His love, and Raoul should have been left to rot in that torture chamber. That he wasn't stands as a testimony to Erik's goodness and mercy. Long live Erik, my lord, my love, my twin soul. If only I could have lived in His time."
4,Great Beginning. Great End. Boring In Between,"""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a beautiful story: well-conceived, inspiring, overwhelming, original images. It starts off in a great way, and the ending is a tear-jerker. There were too much details in the middle ,however, describing The Persian's and Raoul's attempts to reach the abducted Chrisitine. These ""boring: details also stray the reader from the heart of the story, and you couldn't help wondering sometimes if you are reading a boyish adventure book, or a deep novel about human struggle. Although all the events of the movie and the musicals were derived from the novel, they were able to do what Leroux missed: focus on the characters and deeply explore their emotional turmoil. The Phantom of the Opera is a great story, that could've been better written and handled (however the movie and musical well-compensated this deficiency)."
5,Simply Excellent.,"This is THE MOST comprehensive book to date on the 1925 film, 'The Phantom of the Opera'. It has countless articles, interviews, facts, newspaper clippings, screencaps, photographs, etc. Amazing. 'Nuff said."
4,Here's there inside your mind,"One of the best pieces of literature I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The story starts off slow but once it starts to pick up, it's a definite page turner.This is more of a psychological thriller than anything. Sometimes you doubt that the Phantom is real but then something happens to make you second guess yourself.The ending was not what I had expected at all and I was a little disappointed with the timidity of Christine Daae. Christine is one of the stranger characters in literature and I really expected her, at the end, to become one of the greats in opera but Gaston Leroux was not inclined to be conventional.A must have for every collection of classic literature."
1,Tedious!,"This book was not at all what I had envisioned - the play was so amazing, I guess I was expecting more from the book. Near the apex of the story, I actually considered discontinuing the book because I found the ""intrigues"" of the phantom truly tedious. Total waste of time... watch the movie, it's far more entertaining."
2,"A disappoinment of a ""supposedly"" good book","My english teacher gave me this book, telling me how wonderful and how much I would like it. Well, suffice to say, she was wrong. Now, yes, I said right, English teacher. I may only be 14 years old but I've read everything from Stephen King to the Inferno by Dante Alighieri, and all I can say about this book is that it doesn't do justice to the wonderful play. The storyline skips around like a two year old playing hopscotch, and, although the French names are I'm sure essential, refering to them constantly by their three or four word name can become exhausting. All in all, this is not going to be a book I read again."
4,Essential First Taste of POTO,"After seeing the movie, I became an instant fan of all things ""POTO"" (Phanatom of the Opera) and simply HAD to read the original novel as a first step to learning more about how the story came to be and especially to try to better understand the Phantom. The original story is choppy and leaves a few loose ends; nevertheless, it remains the essential introduction to one of the most fascinating stories ever and whets the appetite for more."
5,Read the book for a fuller picture,"If you love a musical, the book is always a good way to indulge your fancy."
4,Wishing parts of the book would be in the musical.,"My husband surprised me with tickets to see The Phantom of the Opera production. Being the ""nerd"" I am, I decided to read the book before going. I fell in love with the love/horror story.While there are similarities between the book and the production, there are many parts to the book I wish could have been added to the production.If you're a fan of love and don't mind a little bit of creepiness, then check this one out."
4,The Phantom of the Opera,"I actually really enjoyed this book. I didn't read this while in high school and most likely wouldn't have enjoyed it at that point in my life.Also I never saw the movie, so it was untainted for me so that my imagination was free to see the in my own mind. So if you've never read this, or seen the movie; then I would recommend it. It's a truly captivating story, rich in character and suspense."
3,"great book for anyone that,likes to resd",The book is sad but a great book iv read it twice befor once when I was 15 and again now when Im 18. And reading it the second time was just as good as the first a must buy book for any one who loves to read
3,Not that great,"I bought this book after seeing the broadway show a few times and watching the movies.The book to me was all over the place in focus. Drifting back and forth. Raoul is such a winy wimp in the book and Christine is almost evil in the way she treats both the Phantom and Raoul.The only thing I can say is that if you are a fan of the broadway show or the movies, this book clears up some questions and details that you miss in the show and movies.All in all it's a great story idea, poorly written."
2,Wow. This is really a bad book.,"No seriously.I had the highest expectation for this experience. But the story is a mess.It's episodic to the point of distraction. The point of view changes randomly. At one point it's a confession, or a ""verbal account"". Then it is a written account from a character hardly seen in the first 70% of the story. To say the characters are weakly developed is an insult to...uh...weak people. The language is occasionally witty, but often repetitive and uninteresting.The best part of the novel is the epilogue, which gives details of the Phantom's origins, all of which are FAR more interesting than the contents of the book. I also loved a bit about the real Opera House that came with my Easton Press copy.I loved the stage musical, I loved the old films, I liked the new film...this was extremely disappointing."
5,Suspense not to be missed,One of the best books I have ever read. I could not put the book down once I started it. Leroux is a master at setting the mood for the entire novel from the very first chapter and the story just flows with someof the best memorable characters of all time. The Phantom is truly one of the great characters in all of literature with something that we all can relate too. Just an excellent story that anyone can pick up and read with a depth behind it that you will never forget.
5,Review!,"Great book. I finally took the time to read this classic and it is definitely worth reading. Not quite what I expected, but it is very good."
4,Help,"This answers things I did not understand from the movie. It is hard to imagine how ugly the Phantom is supposed to be because there is no way to Make Gerard Butler ugly. The problem with a handsom, sexy Phantom is that it is hard to understand why Christine didn't chose him. But the book does show the Phantom's great love for Christine. The story is hard to follow sometimes but hang in there because it is a fairly good story."
5,better than I expected,"I waited to get this book for weeks and am so glad I did!! I never read anything like it before. Despite criticisms of it being slow, I found it extremely engaging, I read it in three hours. It is written well and is exciting. I literally jumped in fright in some parts and had tears in my eyes at the end. I would have preferred it been more about Erik than Rauol, and I suggest a least being acquainted with the story before reading it, because of all the characters."
5,This is the best novel i've ever read!,"The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux is a very interesting romance novel. It's about a love triangle between an opera singer, manager, and the all-famous opera ghost. The characters are Raoul de Chagny, one of the managers of the opera, Christine Daae, the opera singer, The Persian, and of course, the phantom of the opera. This phantom takes the lovely young Christine Daae deep beneath the opera, in it's many cellars, and blackmails her to marry him, or else! To find what, you need to get the book and read! You'll never find out with the opera's many trap doors and secrets. You'll never find another romance novel like this! It's a must read! This book is great to read in your free time, for any romance, horror,or even science fiction novel lovers! You'll never regret reading this, so start reading this great story today!"
3,Took a while to build up,"I decided to read this book because I had seen advertisements for the play comming back to town. I am not a big fan of the horror genre but I did like this work. However like many of the peices of its time it took a great deal of time and effort building the scenes and the characters. In this case I thought as soon as all of the build up was complete the book came to a close too quickly.On the other hand, the social commentary was very interesting. The higher in society the higher you find the character in the Opera House. The phantom the lowliest is never seen by the rest of the world. The dark nether regions of the world below are very interesting."
3,love the monster,"This is a great "" misunderstanding"" tale. The setting is an old Paris opera house with the typical man loves girl, but the man in the middle is a monster that is misunderstood. Told in third person, but good detail."
4,excellent story,"the story was quite well-written. i love the tone of the narrator...and leroux quite mastered the art of suspense. it was very enojyable, and i believe it went at a perfect pace. the plot was great, and one can not help but form a connection with ""poor, unhappy erik""..or the ""opera ghost"". the reason i chose to give it only 4 stars is because, as hard as i tried, i could not interest myself in raoul and christine's love affair. they did not intrigue me in the least...and i was quite indifferent towards them. other than that it was an excellent read."
5,This Book has it all!!,"When I say this book has it all, I mean it has it all! its got Mystery, Romance(My Favorte part!),tence,Horror, a little comedy,Heartaces, adventure, drama, and so much more! So far its been my only favorit book.I couldn't believe the emotion I felt, it took me to a hole new world! I first bought the original book and it was a little difficult to understand. When I bought this book I could understand the hole story. it is a very well written, The Phantom of the Opera has everything that I love and can't get enuff of, If you love Romance and Mystery the way I do. You'll love this Book! I highly Recommend it!"
4,"A great, fast-paced book","Although this book is over 300 pages, it gets to the point quickly and is all-and-all an enjoyable book. It took me five weeks to read it, but I didn't read very many pages a day, so it should actually take a very short time to read it. The chapters are also suitable in length, the longest one being thirty pages. This book is about an ""Opera ghost,"" Erik, who is a deformed man who wears a mask all the time. The master of trapdoors, as he is called, wants just one thing: Christine Daae, an Opera Singer, and he will go to any lengths to carry out his dream, including stealing money and even killing people. Meanwhile, Raoul de Chagny, whom Christine is in love with, fights to get Christine back from the phantom. I think you will find this book quite interesting, intriguing, even a little scary."
5,I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS 10 STARS!!! SAYS IT HOW IT IS!,"Contrary to all the Lynyrd Skynyrd sycophants, this is an AWESOME CD!~!! If it pisses them off because Pyle puts it out there and calls a spade a spade TOO DAMN BAD! I for one am tired of the ""corporation"" Lynyrd Skynyrd has become. Johnny had tried a solo career with ZERO LUCK so he climbed up on his bros coffin and figured the world would accept him singing for L.S. The world did and as original members died off and were replaced the L.S. machine kept rollin. What is there like Billy Powell and one other sort of original member who actually played drums before they got big and now plays guitar and that's it???GO FOR IT ARTIMUS!!!!! THANK GOD SOMEONE SETS THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON RECORD!!!!"
2,Get over it dude,"This is not a very good cd. Artimus needs to move on with his life. I have met him at a concert here where I live. It was in a small club with about 100 people in attendance. We talked a few minutes and he was very likable. The show was good, but he needs to get over not being LS's drummer anymore and just try to make good music."
4,Lots of familiar tunes,"I have been looking for this disc for years, but it has been out of print. It was awesome to finally get my hands on it and get some of the better tracks like ""Big Iron Horses"" once again."
4,No ticks on this camping trip,"I bought this and diluted it to a .01% solution (about 1 tsp to 2 cups water- 5 ml:500 ml) and used a trigger sprayer to soak soak a pair of shoes and 2 pair of pants and 2 shirts for 4 people. It was tedious and making up a bucket of the stuff would certainly be more efficient. I liked the trigger sprayer because I pretty much used up all I made and didn't have to dump any or wring the clothes out. I sprayed the clothes outside, used a mask and gloves and hung everything out to dry over night. There was a chemical smell to the clothing but I thought it was very mild and didn't elicit complaints from my very smell sensitive son. We can all debate the problems with chemicals forever, but I had Lyme disease last summer and don't plan to stay indoors OR get Lyme again. As far as I can tell this did the trick and none of us got a tick bite when we went camping this weekend."
2,A MINOR WORK,"This book consists of 7 comic stories from Will Eisner's Quarterly. The only sparkling story in the collection is the first, entitled ""A Sunset in Sunshine City"" in which an old retired cafeteria owner retires to a condo in Florida to spend the rest of his days with a newly made female friend. The problem is that his daughter's husband is involved in some bad business deals and needs money. So he schemes along with his wife to wrest his fortune from the old man.The other stories range from unfunny to cliched to just plain silly. Especially bad is ""Humans"", in which Eisner's ill-suited style is put to use chronicling our human-like ancestors as they hunt a mastadon and learn the value of cooperation. You can see the endings of most of the stories before they come. They're trite. I would not recommend this to even the most die-hard Eisner fan. Seek your entertainment elsewhere."
3,Brown handle (not black) left me percolating!,"I know I am probably being picky, but hey, the black handle is what is shown, and looks very classy with the silver. The ornament I received has a brown handle, and a brown plastic lid top (where an actual glass perk-top would be). View the matching teapot Amazon suggests purchasing with this, it is just like that. Why did I not order the teapot? Because I didn't like the brown handle!Black handle would have got 5 stars. Sending something other than what is pictured, especially an item that's main purpose is aesthetic, causes customers aggravation. I almost wish it would have been worse, so I could send it back without a thought. Instead I am keeping it and venting here.With that said, the silver pot is nice and shiny, with some weight to it, but no branch bender. Red ribbon about 2' long is included (I double loop it). Now I just need to find some paint that will adhere to plastic, and a little brush. Thanks for listening, I feel a bit better."
5,OMFG - THIS ALBUM CHANGED MY LIFE!,"I can't describe in words how i feel about this EP. It's so different and kickass that I'm blowing my load just thinking about it!!(jk kids) Buy this album fool. peace ..|.,"
1,Saving rock and/or roll.....,"At the Drive-In is a complex musical atmosphere of shapes and colors. So why do I give this EP a 1? Because it's not nearly as emo as their first release, Evil Empire. Then their next release, In Utero, was a masterpiece. Then their singer, Travis Meeks, fired the entire band, and took on an assumed name, Cedric Bixler, while his former band mates took the teen pop world by storm with the band Tantric. Then they released this EP, which is really good, but [bad] compared to their early releases. Face it, Riot Grrrls, they're just ripping off A New Found Glory. You know it. I know it. ""Cedric"" knows it. So get off your high horse and go get ""All Killer No Filler."""
5,Unbelieveable,"This album is my most prized music possesion. Its the most original and mind-blowing thing, i think, that has ever been recorded. The first song, Rascuache, gets you in the mindset for the rest of the album, and then when it all boils down, the ""sad"" song of the album, 198d blows you away.A MUST have for any ATDI fan, no question."
3,The good smoothed over the bad.,"Another year, another At The Drive-In record. I think this was going to be released as three seperate 7-inchers, and thus, it lacks unity. The quality of the songs, however are consistent, and while there may be nothing as jaw-dropping as in/casino/out's ""Napolean Solo"" or ""Alpha Centauri,"" there are still quite a few quite good songs, most of which run along at a punk rock-friendly tempo, while the opener, whose name is impossible to spell without looking at the sleeve, conitnues the great ATDI tradion of slow, sensitive 6/8 songs. Still, there was a bit too much messing around in the studio. I would have liked fewer effects, and a more, for lack of a better term, ""live"" sound. I'd be curious as how some of these songs translate at their shows."
5,The consistency of space,"I love this album. It's so perfect in consistent mood, tone, and hauntingly beautiful, spaced-out melody. This is the real ""pill"" or tablet you take when you need it, not LADIES & GENTLEMEN..."
2,Heavy on technique - Light on drama,"Lazer-Guided Melodies has a lot of interesting techniques going for it. First, the back cover shows that there are 12 compositions on the disc, but my CD players only read 4 index numbers. Rather cute because you can't select or forward to the `hidden' cuts. The painfully slow and monotone vocals are electronically reduced to a drone. Imagine a group of stoned American Indians repeating ""Hey, ya, ya, ya, Hey, ya, ya, ya..."" endlessly. Floating around in a cold and thick soup of electronic swirl are snippets of flute, cello and violin. Although none of the methods used on Lazer-Guided Melodies are original, they are marginally interesting. The disc is heavy on technique, but drama and direction are hopelessly absent. Spiritualized is dreadfully unspirited. Like trying to pour pancake syrup on a freezing February morning, I kept saying, ""Please, hurry up and do something, do anything."""
2,empty music,I bought this album thinking that it would be great...but it's quite ordinary. I mean its really sleepy and it's really hard for me to listen to it all the way through. The vocals are flat and hollow. The lyrics are not very poetical and the istrumentation is quite plain. It would be a chore to listen to it enough times to determine if it would even grow on me.
1,Unmitigated rubbish!,"I bought this album simply because I had read so many good reviews of it. I like to think I have pretty wide and varied musical tastes and I have over 1,000 albums ranging from Sex Pistols to Miles Davis to Nick Drake to Captain Beefheart to Black Uhuru to Sun Ra.... are you starting to get the idea? I can honestly say that this is the only album I have ever heard that I cannot find a single redeeming feature in. Complete and utter self-indulgent, drug-addled, pointless, directionless.... If this system allowed me to give a negative rating then I would unhesitatingly do so!"
4,the best Spiritualized,"This is a terrific album. Each track is incredibly unique and thoroughly filled out, yet still manages to stick to the Spriritualized spacey sound. I beleive it to be better than both Pure Phase and Ladies and Gents..."
4,Spiritualized's Best Album,This is without a doubt their best album. Listening to it is like being transported into an alternate dimension. Soothing melodies combined with synthesizers and echo effects combine to create ethereal bliss. Well worth the purchase.
5,1 Big Eargasm!!!,"It would take days for me to totally give my opinion on this great cd or any of the songs on it so to put it simply :This, along with Pure Phase are my absolute favorite CDs not only of Spiritualized OR Jason Pierce but of all time!! It really is a case of must be heard to believe. This masterpiece is a must for, again, not only fans of Jasons but ANY music fan indeed. You must already have an idea/experience at least of what Spiritualized sounds like/is about. Lazer Guided Melodies is what your expectations are and more..........1 Big Eargasm"
3,A good moment for Donny,"On WHAT I MEANT TO SAY, Donny's clear expressive vocals and surprisingly good songwriting talents come into the forefront. The UK Top 10 hit ""Breeze On By"" creatively samples George Benson's jazz classic ""Breezin'"", and features free-flowing lyrics along with a relaxed vocal performance by the sexy Mr. Osmond.""Breeze On By"", ""In It For Love', ""Keep Her In Mind"", and ""Broken Man"" prove that easy listening music can be very soulful, while on the Bacharach/David classic ""This Guy's In Love With You"", Osmond makes it all look easy when he hits those perfect high notes.The rest of the album has good songs bathed in too-slick music arrangements, especially on the gooey ""One Dream"", the cleverly sincere ""My Perfect Rhyme"", and the uptempo ""Shoulda' Known Better"". A dose of lush mid-70's Marvin Gaye arrangements would do these tunes some good."
5,WOW!!! This CD is phenominal!,"This CD is unbelievable! Donny must be in a perfect place right now. His songs, his voice, all perfect! Anyone who wasn't a fan before (and I find that hard to believe) will certainly be one after listening to this! Perfection."
3,NICE,"This album is not bad at all, but I'd rather see some of his older catalogue get released on CD."
1,How about some music samples?,"Don't like to purchase without hearing some music first. Despite buyers reviews, what happened to Amazon's sound clips?"
2,Oh man,"OK, I admit it--I had the posters and the lunch box. And so a well-meaning friend thought I should have the album. Folks, this guy has been milking the teenybopper reminiscence crowd for way too many years, and it shows here. This is elevator music, and I gave it an extra star because it's not BAD elevator music. But it's not evidence of a comeback, but rather a fairly pathetic career of has-been bygone glory days that would have been much more nobly put out of its misery a long time ago. The Osmond craving for the public spotlight may appeal to the Branson crowd, but anyone who has grown up since 1970 will find this nauseating."
5,Donny Is Better Than Ever!!!,"My cd arrived today and I absolutely love this cd. I love Donny's cover versions of ""Right Here Waiting"" and ""This guy's in Love with You"", which Donny recorded in his younger days. It demonstrates just how far Donny has come.I love the songs that Donny co-wrote with a number of people. Where it used to be that Donny usually sang songs written by others (with the exception of a few), with this cd, Donny has come into his own to include composer to his list of talents as a singer and musician.Buy this cd. If you are not a fan of Donny, you will after purchasing this cd.Excellent job Donny. I have been a fan of yours for many years and I continue to be a proud fan."
5,The BEST Donny Osmond CD EVER!!!,I love this CD. Donny's voice is incredible and the songs melt your heart!
1,stail,I love these noodles when bought in your local market but I bought 3 cases on my first order and all 3 were stail....They resent me 3 more cases and very lil differece in freshness. Id advise not to buy thes on line they are a rotated stock that has not been rotated.
3,Good Summary,"This is reasonably good summary of terrorism. I only gave it three stars because it attempts to do too much in too little space. Most of the chapters deal with issues too complex for a single chapter. Never-the-less, it is a good starting point for understanding the different faces of terrorism."
1,Not a Dan Brown novel,"Medici Dagger lacked substance. The characters were underdeveloped, the storyline was lacking in depth, and the writing was terrible. I noticed grammatical errors and editing errors throughout the book.Many times the author was telling the story instead of leading us on a journey through the life of Reb Barnett. ""Let he who finds the Dagger use it for noble purpose. That was my father's plan. And now it's mine."" The story read more like a cheesy Harlequin novel than a serious work."
3,"Average, at times poor writing","Here is a story of a Hollywood stuntman, Reb Barnett, who goes to Italy to find Da Vinci's Circles of Truth, which is a coded fifteenth century map that will lead him to the Medici Dagger,an invention of a weapon which can revolusionize the weapons industry and bring billions to anyone who owns it. Reb tries to find out about his father's mysterious death and he believes it is all connected to the dagger. Average thriller with poor writing at times. 3 stars for the idea."
1,Simply Awful..... Really,"or should I simply say, really awful...I normally read non-fiction history books, but I figured that I would take a break and read something a little lighter... This was in the clearance section - or was it the 'last chance' section - of my favorite Barnes and Noble, and the word 'Medici' in the title caught my eye. I figured that for $5.98 it was worth a shot... It wasn't...I could go on and on with examples of the poor quality of the writing, but I have wasted enough time on this book.What is really discouraging is that for $5.98 I could have bought a newspaper and a soy caramel machiatta with an extra shot..If you are thinking about buying this book... don't. Take the money that you would have spent, and donate it to charity. You will feel better about yourself, stop yourself from wasting time, and get a tax break out of the deal."
2,Disappointing Action Novel...needs to be edited!,"This was my first read of a Cameron West novel, and it seems like a poorly edited first novel withan interesting premise but lousy execution. Cameron's characters dialog goes from middle school childish to 'lovestory' over the top emotion to pop psychology gibberish. Only the actual action scenes are worth readingand the back ground on the Medici Dagger itself. It feels like a 1970s style novel with a kitchen sinkof characters and absurd situations and plot devices. I only give it 2 stars because of the basic plotand mystery/treasure hunt. This would be a good book for any college writing class to use as fodder for how NOTto write an action novel."
2,Chee-zee,"Most of the story is so over dramatic it seems forced. I have found myself thinking, ""Give me a break!"" It is difficult to care about the characters enough to finish the book."
3,He Ain't Dan Brown!,"After reading the back of this book, it appealed to me because it uses a Dan Brown-like storyline. The search for an ancient relic that has implications in the world today. The book was a predicatable and shallow novel that I had to make myself finish. The plot centers around a Hollywood stuntman whose parents were killed in a fire 25 years previous. He has spent his life avoiding close relationships and dreaming of his parents. When he is contacted by one of his Father's former associates, he is treated to a deathbed confession that his parents were murdered and introduced to the Medici Dagger, a dagger created by Davinci, then subsequently hidden due to the implication of it getting into the wrong person's hands.Intrigued by the dagger search and driven by the thoughts of exacting revenge on his parent's killer, Reb, our protagonist, goes on a search for both. What follows is character predictability and tedious plot lines."
1,Absolutely horrible,This is just a laughably horrible novel. I should have been forewarned by the lack of blurbs on the cover. It's cliche-ridden with only a clumsy parody of an emotional subtext and no character development. I imagine the only reason it made it to publication is the Da Vinci hype.
3,It's entertaining ....,"It's entertaining enough to keep me reading it till the last page has been turned ~~ and fortunately for me, it's a slim book otherwise I would have lost interest in it half way through. It's entertaining enough for summer reading when you don't have a lot of time to read especially if you're chasing after kids. It's not intriguing enough like The DaVinci Code where I stayed up all night reading it just to find out what happened. That was years ago though.The Medici Dagger was interesting enough where the character, written in first-person, was funny, ironic and sarcastic. The chase to find the dagger was fast but predictable and so is falling in love with his female counterpart in this search.This is honestly the best beach read ~~ it's fast and intriguing even if predictable ~~ but it doesn't make you think on the next step and it does keep you entertained. While not the best suspense novel I've read, it's ok.7-6-06"
5,Great Book,"I loved this book. It held my interest throughout the book. I love it so much that I recommend it to friends and even buy it as a gift. It is similar to Dan Brown's religious books like Angels and Demons, etc. Great story!"
2,Frustrating,"This would be a good tale if the author could try to avoid bad poetics. ""...I hung up, gently this time, totally intoxicated with emotion, but thirsting for more, dying to drink from her well forever, to gulp quenching heartfuls of her."" I read that and was seized with an urge to gulp quenching mouthfuls of alcohol, but I decided to finish the book anyway. I had invested enough time in it already. I probably missed some of the story line as I tried to skim over similar cloying sentiments, however, if I were the author next time I wouldn't try to create a romance-action novel hybrid. It's just not a good combo."
1,This book stunk,"To call Cameron West a third rate Dan Brown is an insult to authors who are a third rate Dan Brown type of an author. He slapped a few locations together with silly character development and called it a novel. I feel as though I am owed my money back from him.After reading the likes of Brown, Crichton and Grisham (and maybe even Archer), I am used to people painstakingly researching what they are actually writing about. This book didn't even attempt to make me doubt reality by weaving reality into the plot.Please... save your money and your time. This book just ain't worth it!"
1,Dagger in my brain,Worst Book I ever read. Cameron Wests writing ability is the antithesis of Dan Browns.
1,"Awful, truly awful...","This book was just terrible, I don't know why I finished it. The writing was terrible, especially the dialog. And the author has clearly has no clue about women. I mean really, crying and slapping a guy when he doesn't jump into bed with you at the first opportunity? Give me a break!"
2,"not great, but...","Yes, as has been noted, this book has its problems. But it's quick to read and somewhat entertaining. Something light and undemanding to read at the beach or on the train. And it's been remaindered. I've read worse."
1,wHAT A WASTE OF TIME,"Thank goodness I got this book from the library!!If I had spent money on it I`d be really annoyed,it had promise but didn`t make it not even close.Don`t waste your money if you feel you must read it go to the library don`t spend your cash on this loser."
1,What a deceiving video!!!!,"This is the worst video I have ever bought. It says on the packaging that there are puppets in the video, which is one of the reasons I bought it. Are they joking? They show them in the opening and ending for about 1/2 a minute each time, ok, maybe 1 minute each time. If you want something musical, stick with Baby Mozart, Baby Beethoven, or if you like Sesame Street, my daughter's all time favorite is Sesame Sings Kareoke."
4,My twins really like this video!,"I was surprised to see such negative reviews of this DVD. My 5 month old twins can't get enough of this or the other Fisher Price DVD titled Baby's Day. I also own some of the Baby Einstein DVD's, but am frustrated by the limited number for babies under 1 year. It is true that every baby is different, but I would recommend this to anyone looking for something for children who are between 3 and 12 months. I do wish the puppets would play a larger role in the DVD, but I like that it includes lots of other children and scenes from nature set to music. It focuses on very specific instruments like drum, horn and violin as well as voice. I like the way it's done and if your babies are going to spend a limited amount of time in front of the TV there is a lot worse you can do."
2,Would NOT recommend,"I noticed the advertisement in this months Parents magazine for the new Fisher Price baby videos. My 6 month old daughter really enjoys Baby Einstein, but quite honestly I am getting a little bored w/ her videos (I am sure that all parents reach that point). I decided to give the Fisher Price video a try, and picked it up on my last trip to Babies R Us. I am VERY disappointed. The picture quality is grainy. The content is boring (my little one wholeheartedly agrees). Not to mention the ""music"", which I find to be very irritating. I would not recommend this product, and I am hoping that I can find the receipt and take it back."
3,Son gets irritated at puppet shows,"I thought this series of videos would be a nice ""change of pace"" from Baby Einstein for my 8 month old, but he gets very upset everytime the puppet shows come on. I think that an 8 month old, cognitively, could not understand the humor of the puppet shows, and they last way too long to be making no sense. It's silly to be using puns and jokes for this age group! The Baby Einstein puppets are more captivating because they utilize motion and colors. My son actually cries every time Dee, Ed, and Ta (of this video) show their face. He equally dislikes Baby Day and Nature Baby (I hope I get the names correct). Perhaps he will grow to appreciate this video when he is a little older, but it's not great for a small baby."
5,We love this video,"We were loyal consumers of Baby Einstein (BE)and decided to try this video for a change. Yes, it's different than BE and it may take two to three viewings to appreciate. The puppets are great and no they are not on the video the entire time. What makes this video better than the BE ones in my opinion is that they feature parents and children of all ages and ethnicities doing things instead of just showing toys jumping in an out of the screen like the BE videos. My sons, ages one and three, love it and really enjoy watching the other children. They imitate what the children do and have gained, especially the 3 year old, an appreciation for different muscial instruments. The children playing the instruments on the video are quite talented and this alone is to be appreciated by anyone."
4,Keeps kids' attention,"We only have this Musical Baby DVD so far but the kids love it. The puppets are definitely the stars, but the program is well put-together and actually teaches the kids (from baby to preschool) useful things. The musical performances featured are uneven in quality, from very good (the singing boy) to very bad (the three violin players). Of all the baby DVDs we bought this is among the best. I also recommend the Fisher-Price Little People claymations, now out-of-print but still available from third-party sellers."
5,must have for puppet lover baby,"i rented this dvd at the local library, along with the award winning Hap Palmer ""baby songs"". my 14 month old who loves baby einstein, and anything with babies, puppets or music, hated the praised hap palmer dvd, but absolutely loved the fischer price dvd. she squeeled every time the puppets came and danced when the music came on. i cant wait to buy this dvd to have for her to watch more. thank you."
5,Best baby video EVER!!!!,My son has been watching this video since he was 3 months old. He LOVES it!!! Smiles a LOT when it is on. More than the Einstein videos. I'm ordering the whole series:)
5,"Great Video, better than BE","I got this for my 8 month old son. He does not like the BE videos, so I thought for $10 why not, guess what, he likes it. He will sit and watch the whole thing. The best part is he likes the puppets in it. I give it 5 stars, and I will get the others also."
3,My son won't watch it...,"This is a cute DVD but my 6 month old son has absolutely *no* interest in it. I don't know if he will like it when he is older or not. He tends to like watching toys, puppets, and animation (he loves Baby Einstein videos, Maisy, and Miffy) but isn't as interested in real-world videos or people. This DVD is mostly filled with clips of children singing and of real animals, so I guess it's just not what he enjoys watching...UPDATE:We now have a 2nd child...she is 7 months old and also isn't very interested in this video. She'll glance at it here and there while playing, but it definitely doesn't hold her interest. It's a cute video, so I am not sure why both of my kids didn't find it interesting..."
5,Dark comedic noir set in a cutthroat real-estate office.,"An office full of small-time real-estate hustlers is the setting of Mamet's blackly-humorous Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Competing against each other for their very jobs while trying to unite against a hostile boss, these characters are brutal Willy Lomans trapped in a world where lying is a virtue and where cruelty is a strength. Yet they are also human beings drawn to each other for support and companionship. When a robbery is committed in their midst, tensions boil over as each man tries to save himself and still make a buck. Mamet has written a brutally-hilarious satire of capitalism and machismo that also manages to be a compassionate portrayal of men caught in inhuman circumstances. This one will make you laugh even as it makes you think"
5,Great,This is a very easy and quick read. Powerful for its short length. I would and have recommended this product to others.
3,It's ok,"This handle is made of really nice, durable, material. I don't see ever having to replace it. The only thing I don't like is it doesn't sit right on my toilet. No matter what I do, there is a lot of play in the handle."
4,What can I say - it works! clean and stylish upgrade,"I had to replace a cheap plastic handle that was broken at my parents' house. Looking on Amazon, I found this one that would ship to their house (saves me the hassle of going to a local hardware store) for the same price as the local stores.Installation was very simple and the handle looks great and much more stylish than the cheap white plastic handle that was on there before.FYI it was the plastic rod that pulls up the flap in the tank that broke. This lever has a nice handle and a metal rod that won't break the same way the old one did."
1,"It's metal, but it's CHEAP","I expected something much better. the part did not fit in the hole in my tank, and the lever was not even articulated in the sleeve---the rotation was solely due to the lousy fit. It constantly snagged the chain. Hugely disappointing. I ended up taking it out and throwing it away. I ended up buying a Danco 89448A universal lever, and it has been great. Don't waste your time, just buy the Danco."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was looking for a duvet that wasn't costly so this seemed to fit my search. The color is fine, my set was missing a button on the duvet closure but no big deal, I have a king goose down blanket and the fit was not perfect and there was a lot of shifting, also this duvet fabric wrinkles easily (makes things appear messy). I think this is good for maybe a guest bedroom where the bed would be used infrequenntly otherwise you'll be using an iron a lot. Overall it was a good deal, but seriously...you get what you pay for."
1,Why oh why?,"BMG's decision to release this album is unfathomable. With the exception of the disastrous Lanza on Broadway LP (mercifully unavailable - at present - on CD), this was the tenor's worst album. Recorded around the time of his first heart attack, Lanza was in very poor spirits indeed when he recorded this, and it shows. Unlike the Broadway album, his singing is not downright bad; it's simply devoid of the tenor's trademark warmth and vitality. O Christmas Tree is, perhaps, the only exception on this otherwise gloomy offering.For an infinitely more sparkling alternative, check out the singer's beautiful Christmas with Mario Lanza CD. It's available through Amazon, and reviewed on these pages."
1,Maybe the worst designed multimedia speakers ever created,"Cambridge SoundWorks are the most flawed multimedia speakers ever built. I've gone through two new units in 2002 and 2003. They were susceptible to minor voltage surges, which destroyed the powered sub woofer power supplies. Just by flicking your surge protector power strip on and off, the amp in the sub woofer would react negatively. It actually ruins them. I would never buy anything from Cambridge SoundWorks ever again!!! I don't know why CREATIVE bought them out. Although Creative made junk audio products themselves. I guess inbreeding eventually wipes out families."
1,Bad service,"I suggest to people to not buy items from beauty4you it was FAIR & white exclusive whitenizer. I say this because, i happen to placed an order a 2 weeks ago and they stilll havent ship me the item yet. Idk whats going on but i'm just warning people.Before you buy the item Look into it carefully who the seller is and aslo Look into the reviews and than do the action!"
3,An absolute pain to install,"Got this for my wife's GTI and the the installation is an absolute joke. Screws are JUST a little too short and the instructions make absolutely no sense. All pictures, no writing with no explanation HOW one is supposed to do what it says in the picture. Some of the pictures do not make any sense without something to explain them. Got it on, looks OK but not great. Took three people pressing down on the deflector so hard I was afraid it was going to crack to get the second screw set."
1,LOOKS OLD,THE SELLER SAID IT IS GOLD PLATED BUT THE WATCH DOES NOT HAS ANY PRENT SAYS IT IS GOLD PLATED . IT HAD DIFFERENT MODEL NUMBER THAT THE SELLER PUT IN AMAZON
5,The Gor Saga,"The Gor Series nearly disappeared, becoming ""collector's items"" because it isn't ""politically correct"" to have strong men and submissive women.Glad to see them available and affordable. Get all 27 of them.Dancer is a very good book in the series and one of the most popular."
4,Some of the music here is fantastic...,"...and the rest is interesting. It features the great 1937sessions with Django Reinhardt and Stephan Grapelly, includingLady Be Good, Dinah, Daphne, Sweet Georgia Brown. These cutsare outstanding examples of jazz violin.Much of the other music on both volumes is not really jazz.It's what I'd call ""high society cafe-music"", without improvisation.Beautifully played violin though..."
5,Belly ring,"Cute belly button ring. There is a slight discoloration in the back now, but no biggie. The front looks good."
1,Not a genealogy research source,Too scatter-brained. No real consistency in family line. Looks like the author is trying to claim kin to every Hughes that came to early America.Cannot recommend as a genealogy research source.
5,An unusual twist on End Times Fiction!,"I highly recommend this book and it's 2nd part, Fallen Stars, Bitter Waters. These books are a world apart from traditional End Times fiction, such as ""Left Behind."" If you can get past this author's idea that everyone in the future has a weird and lengthy name, you'll find an engrossing (if complicated) plot and a diverse group of characters. I'm very frustrated by the publisher's decision to NOT publish part three of this trilogy, but I still recommend reading the first two."
1,I fall asleep everytime I pick it up.,"Ok, I bought both of these books because of the rave reviews you people are giving it. But for the past two years I cannot seem to get through book one. It is awful and boring. As soon as there is a character that holds my interest they end up in the woods and not spoken of again. I see why the writers don't want to continue it. The book sucks and doesn't make any sense. And ever page they keep introducing a new character with no depth or any real purpose. This might sound strange but the book is just too wordy for no reason and it won't get to the point or the purpose. I guess those who love the book must be related to the publishers or the writers of course you are going to celebrate the book because you want it to sell and I guess I fell for it."
3,Packaging was damaged,"This mug was cute but the package was damaged upon arrival, thus making this gift appear like a discount store gift. Please make sure package is ok prior to shipment."
3,another take on the old songs,I found this music to be interesting and upbeat. I've always liked the Beatles music. This is not especially stunning or brilliant but it is nice to listen to when I'm doing other things. I have some cordless headphones and I really like this CD while I'm out working in the yard. I see it is priced at almost 25 dollars. I don't think it's worth that. I didn't pay that much for my copy a few years ago. I wouldn't pay that much for it. It's good but not that good.
5,"""A Foggy Day""","Sandi and Kathy sound like they were made to sing ""big band"" music. They both pull it off so well, it's amazing. I've been listening to Sandi Patti for a long time now, and she never ceases to amaze me with her versatility. ""A Foggy Day"" really sends chills up my spine! I've never seen Sandi live in concert, but if she and Kathy Troccoli are ever in Phoenix, I will DEFINITELY go see the concert. This album is awesome!"
4,Not your typical Sandi Patty,I didn't know what to expect from this album... it's not your typical Sandi Patty disc. I'm constantly amazed by her broad range of styles and the depth she conveys in each song.
3,Works...but not for me,"The touch pad works fine, but it just wasn't for me. I use high-resolution displays and it just wasn't accurate enough when trying to zero in on really small items on the screen. Also there seemed to be a lag that always caused me to go back and forth trying to hit on some small detail in an image or in a game.For working all day, the pad was tiring because I couldn't rest my hand on it like I can on a mouse or, what I currently use, on a Logitech Trackman Wheel. The button position doesn't really work. To reach the pad comfortably, you have to curl your hand to press the buttons. If you position to reach the buttons comfortably, you have to reach too far for the pad. I felt that having the buttons on the side would be better. Still, it can't compare to my Trackman Wheel or to a regular mouse, where you never need to move your fingers much to click."
4,SmartCat USB,It works pretty much as expected. I have used an older Cat for several years and it took a couple days to get used to the minor differences in feel and movement. It does occasionally mix up my button assignments after one of the kids has been playing a game. A reboot takes care of it.
4,great EP,These are some great songs. A great mix of blues riffs with good old rock N Roll. The lyrics are well thought out and meaningful. This is definetly a band on the rise. I suggest to buy this now!!
4,A Great Book,"This is a great novel, and Tevis is a very good writer. It is a morality tale brought down to the level of the worst aspects of American capitalism (that is, the seediest levels, which remain with us today). But hidden in Tevis' story of gambling, alcoholism and identity crisis is an empathy for people that redeems their worst habits. I really enjoyed it and recommend it highly."
2,The Movie was better,"One of those few books that one can say the movie was much more livelier. In the book we never know whether Fast Eddie pays Bert the money that he wins in the final game and of course Sarah does not go with Bert and Eddie to Lexington. On the whole it was a lifeless novel. It seems the reputation of Tevis is based more on the success and acting of Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason , Piper Lori as well as the direction of Robert Rossen than anything that he wrote. I was not impressed by his writing. I loved the movie."
2,Cheap Printing - Poorly Written,There was very little useful information content and the printing was primitive. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Best book to have for Japanese language studies.,"I got this book because I lost the copy I had from Borders. I was satisfied about this book's results and it is helpful to read about proper communication in the Japanese Language. Also, it's excellent for beginners and those who want an easy start on their journey to learn Japanese fluently. The book is cheaper to get from this site since at Borders it costs up to $22 to get plus shipping and handling. That is too much for me! :SThis book is the best to have when you want to learn japanese fluently. like me. ;)"
5,Excellent Book!!! But...,"Only appropriate for those who have taken Japanese lessons previously. It's a book mainly to enhance the skills of those in the intermediate level of Japanese. I loved the way how the author gave the English-->Romanji-->Kana format of the sentences (with pronuciations too!). I can recognize more kanji now! Also, I loved how the author made sentences in a way to show the learner there are multiple ways into saying the sentence! It keeps you up to date and more well-rounded in your Japanese speaking. Overall, this book was a Godsend! It helped strengthen my Japanese language skills and made explanations on how to develop correct japanese sentence structures more clear to me. THIS IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR JAPANESE LANGUAGE LIBRARY! I am soo glad I brought this book! I can now speak Japanese with confidence. No regrets into buying this book! You will not be disappointed."
5,"If you have children, BUY THIS!!!","I'm a preschool teacher in Pennsylvania and the children in my class love this album. It gets them up and dancing like no other album can. The best song has to be "" Learn The Language"" Three different sets of animals throw a party and invite all of the other animals but since each animal speaks their own ""language"" the others don't understand them. It focuses on learning about other people and how important it is to take the time to understand one another. It's a huge hit in my room. All of the other songs on this album are wonderful too! Jim Rule is awesome! Buy this and and you'll be hooked!"
4,Great variety of recipes,This book has some very useful information about the art of barbecuing and contains a huge variety of recipes for a huge variety of dishes. I was actually expecting more recipes for BBQ sauces and rubs which is why it did not get the top rating. I believe this book will take years to sample all of the interesting dishes but think that it will be worth the effort.
4,Great book for those who like BBQ.,"I love to cook, especially out in my backyard with the smoker. If this is you, then you will want this book. It has a plethora of recipes that will make you the envy of your neighborhood. It also explains the differences in slow smoking and grilling. You cannot go wrong in buying this book!!!"
3,BBQ blues,Not a bad book. The competition info is standard. The recipes are good. He gives a variety of recipes for all types of meat and fish. I haven't tried any yet to see if they are REALLY good....
4,Give the man his due!,"Chef Paul, has been a leader in the world of BBQ, whether you are for him or against, he has made a BIG mark in this area of the food world. As a follow chef and competitor, I respect his achievements and knowledge. This book is loaded with Great information and different recipes. A little overwelming in size. But still a GREAT book. I wish Paul well with the book!"
4,"An excellent primer to competition BBQ, just maybe not backyard gilling","This book is a good primer for competition barbecue. If you are looking for information on how to run your smoker, set up your fire, and some of the basics of competition then you won't find a better book. However, if you are looking for a book will well-written recipes for the average backyard griller, look at Steven Raichlen's BBQ USA. Chef Kirk doesn't give you all of the basic recipes you may be looking for. In fact, his goal is to give you some basics and have you experiment. He does provide background on his techniques along with some of his older recipes. But you can tell he didn't give enough away so you could go out and beat him! Overall, it is an entertaining read and a pretty good reference. But there are other books with better recipes."
5,Easy to follow guide to better barbecue,"I found the book easy to read and follow. I have gone from burger, brats and dogs to succulent spare ribs, baby backs, pork butt, tenderloins, and turkeys. The tips and tools are all in the book.Learn about grilling vs. smoking (barbecue); types of grills/smokers; wood and charcoal; tools you need and ingredients you will want. There are plenty of good recipes to use or borrow from to create your own masterpiece.Slathers, rubs, marinades, spices, pork, beef, chicken, turkey, sausage and fish. The book has a nice index for quickly finding your desired information. Excellent and informative. Thanks for opening my eyes. My tastebuds are happy now!"
5,MUST HAVE,"I have had this book for a long time now. EVERYTHING I have made useing this book has been awesome. We are really picky about our BBQ. Not only does the author go into recipes, but the theory of BBQ, Smoking, and grilling. It covers Fish, beef, pork, lamb, poultry, veggies, and countless sauces, rubs, dips, and mops. IF YOU OWN A SMOKER OR A GRILL YOU SHOULD GET THIS BOOK. It goes well beyond basic cooking and is way above any on those Home and Gardens, Reader Diegest, oe Betty Crocker books. This a book you will be proud to have."
5,Baron Von BBQ,"I wish I was Paul Kirk so I could eat mexican food every day. This book will teach you all the ins and outs of making a great pizza and pasta dishes too. I only hope to visit Spain someday so I can meet him!!! Oh, bt the way, my wife thinks he's hot!!!!"
4,"Terrific, except for....","The CD only had one problem. Where's Annie? It's one of the best musicals out there with some of the best songs. Where's TOMORROW or HARD KNOCK LIFE? Other than that, it's a great CD"
3,Poor choice of recent musical selections,"While this CD represents a wide variety of musical styles and performances, the inclusion of works from Titanic and Ragtime alongside Oklahoma and Cabaret gives me pause. Works from recent shows such as Rent, Phantom, Les Mis, or even Cats are far more deserving of inclusion. Tinanic and Ragtime will not withstand the test of time of the other included works."
2,where is all the music,"Okay all of those songs are great but I have a question. Where is Andrew LLoyd Webber on this CD? Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat, Evita and CATS? How can you manage to make a CD of Broadway with out Andrew Lloyd Webber? They need to re-do this cd."
4,A great album - fresh and exciting look at old favourites,"Mainly 30's and 40's rehash of old romantic favoutites, but done with a fresh and lively flavour, that brings it right up to date. Thouroghly enjoyable and something you can listen to again and again. The best easy going listening."
4,Insight Pocket,"It's really a good dictionary. Only recently I knew that it's the same as Langenscheid's Pocket Dictionary. No worry about it, you get an excellent dictionary of this category for a little price. It's organized in a romaji order from A to Z but the japanese characters come first. And if you want to find by a kanji, the complete 1945 characters' list comes just after Introduction. Compare to Langengenscheid's this one has a smaller text, that's why I put 4 stars, but if you want a smaller size of the dictionary itself you can certainly correct me."
4,great look into the harlem renaissance,"This book is a fast reading, simple to understand look into the life of black women during the Harlem Renaissance. These short stories give a deep glimpse into a part of histroy that is usually forgotten. Nella wrote of her experiences and I think that is what makes these short novels so great."
5,Remarkable,"Quicksand was an overlooked treasure during Renaissance. Pay close attention to the detail, the surroundings, and the inner thoughts of the main character.... simply marvelous."
2,Unrealized Potential,"I read Quicksand, not Passing, and I don't know whether I will read Passing. You will understand why I may not read it after you have read my review of Quicksand.The premise of Quicksand was what attracted me to the book: what it feels like to be a biracial woman living in the early twentieth century. However, the author was unable to carry out her theme. 95% of the book is the author telling us how the heroine feels without much explanation of why she feels that way. Further, there's little dialogue so that the reader could draw her own conclusions about how or why the heroine feels a certain way. For that reason it is difficult to relate to the heroine. The author also places the heroine in set stereotypical scenes (stereotypical for the early twentieth century). This gives the book a contrived feeling and makes it even more difficult to relate to the heroine."
1,NORAD,"NORAD told the 9/11 Commission they couldn't locate errant aircraft on 9/11 because the planes turned off thier transponders! Wow, too bad the Soviets folded (Sic) back in 1991. Little did the Soviets know that all they had to do to defeat America was to ensure that the transponders on their Cruise missiles and Black-Jack bombers were turned to the OFF position! Sander Hicks posits that Bush & Co. let 9/11 happen. The big lie NORAD told the 9/11 Commission confirms Bush & Co. made 9/11 happen."
3,I thought EMI would've mixed these into first-time stereo...NO WAY,"Along with the first Procol Harum LP, these 1967 Donovan recordings are the last mono or rechanneled albums issued. Three tracks from this and the Mellow Yellow original LPs (Sunshine Superman, Season Of The Witch and Sunny South Kensington) have been mixed into stereo. Strangely, only Sunshine Superman is in stereo here....the other two are mono!I'm very disappointed that they did NOT remixe Legend To A Girl Child Linda, Ferris Wheel, Bert's Blues, The Trip, Guinevere, The Fat Angel, or Celeste into stereo.To my ears, these tracks sound no better than the US Epic original CDs."
3,Not a highlight for Zack,This album is a recording of one song played in 4 different ways. There are even a couple of instrumental verions of the song. Everyone thats in the song only has about a paragraph of lyrics. Only thing else I can say is they could have done a lot better.
1,Garbage,"This man is a disgrace to humankind and Anyone who buys into his lies should have there head examined. If one would take the time to review his case one would realize that he is a scumbag cop-killer. Frankly, I say they should let him cook"
3,"Stinky, but effective","If you can get past the awful smell, it works fine. I end up washing my daughter's hair twice, once with this to get the chlorine out, then again trying to get rid of this product's smell."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding,"Who would want to make a tribute to a Klansman? Whoever they are (Senator Dodd? Kennedy? Kerry?) ought to have their heads examined.There is nothing at all in Mr. Byrd's record, outside of making scores of empty speeches as if that would exorcise a sordid past, that is worth commenting upon, let alone saluting.I'm sure he made plenty of speeches in those backwoods with the rest of the white-hooded creeps. Lerone Bennett and Julian Bond, do take note.So who will the U.S. Senate pay tribute to next? David Duke? Louis Farrakhan? Maxine Waters?Do better things with our taxpayer dollars, please. Provide electricity to Native Americans in the Southwest. Save the beautiful wild horses in Nevada and elsewhere that are threatened with death. Provide the funding to give our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan with body armor. But please, no tributes to an (ex?) Klansman.And stop wasting the lives of trees for guys like Byrd."
1,Piece of Garbage,This watch broke just after the warranty ended.TAG's are a garbage Swiss brand. The Company is just a marketing organization that sell mass produced watches.Want a real watch get a Breitling.
5,"""Excellent Seller""",Great Seller!!! I Recommed It Highly!!! Good prices and fast delivery. What more can anyone ask for?Thanks!
4,These 'Cads are Go!,"This is a very stylin' release. Kick back, put on your smoking jacket, pour a martini and bask in beautiful music - tight guitar instrumentals and lush rhythms all beautifully played. I don't know if these guys have ever seen a surfboard, much less been on one, but who cares? A must for any serious collector of surf-guitar instrumentals."
3,alaska's wild denali,"To Whom It May Concern:This DVD was not as substantial as others I have viewed. 'Twas of good photographic quality; however, unlike many of the documentaries I have purchased, too many people were part of the DVD instead of more Denali National Park -- its panoply of flora and of fauna, and of its mystifyingly beautiful land."
1,Outdated edition,"My initial thought was that i got very luck with one of my college books costing so little money. Yet when i actually went to class, it turned out it was not the latest edition. In fact it is so old that i cannot use it for the class at all. The product itself is in fine condition and all, but it was useless to me. There should be a link taking potential buyers to the new edition. Here is the newer editionEssays from Contemporary Culture"
2,book review,This book is really boring. It's also kind of outdated. If I hadn't been required to read some of it I would have chosen something else.
1,defective,The threads of the bolt section do not go all the way around therefore the nut cannot screw onto the threads. I don't understand how this got a postive first review. It is defective.
5,A must buy: Geraldine McEwan IS Lucia,"Since the other reviews here relate to the printed version of the E.F. Benson book, I thought I'd chime in with a review that is specific to this CD version read by Geraldine McEwan.McEwan starred as Lucia in the delightful ""Mapp and Lucia"" series in the mid-1980s. It's out on DVD now and I highly recommend you snatch it up immediately before it goes out of print. It's one of the very best British comedies ever.In the series, McEwan establishes what I consider to be the definitive version of Lucia. She is so delightful that as soon as I found out her readings of two of the Lucia books had also been recorded, I bought them -- although I had never purchased books on tape/CD before.Suffice it so say, I was not disappointed. McEwan is a wonderful reader who brings out all the wit of the books, and I can't stress enough how marvelous it is to hear her once again using her ""Lucia voice.""This has my highest recommendation."
3,Okay but for certian types of teachers,If you are a new teacher there is lot you face that you don't know about. As a new teacher I bought this book to get some questions answered and get basic advice. However as an elective teacher in middle school a book has yet to be written that answers the questions that face this select group of teachers. If you are teaching a content area and you are a new middle school teacher then this book might help. But save your money until after you finish your Inservice and New Teacher Training because many of your questions will already be answered.
1,Son/friends never interested,"I had about 4 kids at my house with this video on- ages ranging from 4-7 months, and they all got bored and wouldn't watch. I kept trying to point at the tv to get them excited."
3,Great for watching BUT not to get kids moving like I thought.,"Sure this video is enjoyed by little ones who love to ""watch"" babies, young children, animals and even puppets move. However, I was hoping it ""encouraged"" children to move as suggested in its description- The Baby Moves program can help you enhance your child's physical progress and self-discover. It offers a broad range of movement, from reaching, kicking and crawling to dancing and playing. I guess I thought it would say ok everybody stand up, reach up high, now touch your toes, etc."
3,Fisher Price vs. Baby Einstein,"I bought this DVD at a second hand store and wanted to see how it compared to Baby Einstein. I read lots of good reviews about this DVD. After viewing it with my 14 month old, He did like it especially the different babies and kids. He didn't think much of the puppets though. He loves and laughs so much to the puppets on Baby Einstein. The only thing I didn't like compared to Baby Einstein is that the Fisher Price one moves too quickly from scene to scene. I like how Baby Einstein stays on a scene for a while and doesnt switch quickly. The only thing I liked better in the Fisher Price one is that it shows alot more babies and kids than Baby Einstein. I like the music for both as well. In the end, I do favor Baby Einstein over Fisher Price."
2,not wotht the money,This was not worth the money. My 9 month old grandson could not have cared less about this video. It is just babies crawling around.
4,Well-crafted Journalism,"I think the author did an excellent job with telling the story of those who can no longer (if they were ever able to) speak for themselves. There are also some good examples of ""perhapsing,"" a technique used in journalism and creative nonfiction that fills the gap between what the facts state in black and white and what may have or may not have happened. With that being said, I do believe that the author does too much perhapsing and it makes it seem as if the author is doing it just to add drama. It would be challenging, however, to write a nonfiction book without the luxary of the main subjects' thoughts and maybe that is why the author decided to use so many sentences like ""perhaps she felt this way,"" or ""maybe she was thinking this at the time."" Above all, worth the time."
4,Interesting but somewhat confusing,"The subject matter of this book was very enticing but I found it a bit hard to get into. I thought perhaps there would be more of a ""story"" to this book rather than a documentary. Still a worth read."
5,"""The Bible"" of Weapons Effects","An excellent tome describing in detail all the effects of nuclear weapons explosions.Written for a wide audience, most chapters are divided into two sections: a general (although still detailed) descriptive section, and a technical section replete with mathmatical formulae.Fully illustrated throughout with charts, diagrams, and of course, photos.If you're lucky enough to find a copy with the effects computer still enclosed, it is an interesting bonus.Highly recommended reading for everyone."
4,Great read!,"..it's been many years since I read this book, but I can still remember the story. To me that is the sign of a great read."
5,The hillarious and useful guide to systems of all types,"I read the previous reviews -- the most of them came from people with engineering bend. But this book is not only for engineers, it is for everyone - managers, politicians, lawyers, programmers, urban planners -- you name it. As the matter of fact, you will never read a newspaper the same way after being familiarized with Dr. Gall's book. The Diberterque environment of your office will not feel like something extraordinary after you realize that there are natural reasons why it has become Dilbertesque."
5,Funny way to explore systems and great writing by Dr. Gall.,"I think this is a book every systems engineer must read. It is so funny, yet explores all the details related with systems at all levels. It has also an amazing quantity of examples related to system failures. I really loved this book, and I will keep it after my graduation. For the years to come."
2,What Lind Believes,"The drawing of a baleful Abraham Lincoln on the jacket of this book is a tip-off. The author emphasizes the negative about the sixteenth president at about every turn, especially as related to race. Michael Lind seems more interested in giving his theories on the post Civil War development of the modern Republican party--viewed by Mr. Lind as now the party of Jefferson Davis--than writing about President Lincoln as a human being making hard choices within the context of trying times. While there is much of interest in this book, I suggest any first time reader on Lincoln explore other, more balanced presentations such as those by David Herbert Donald."
2,this is the pits,"avoid this book. bad information. author writes the book tofit his opinion. facts are distorted, unchecked. get it offthe shelf and into the trash."
4,"Not so easy to use, well made","the unit is well made but it is not easy to use. Its a bit complicated to set the desired torque, you have to keep the instructions with the wrench as you won't remember how to do it next time either.--------------- UPDATE TO REVIEW ------------The wrench has since fallen apart sine I left the original review. so it is not well made... Would only give it one star if I could edit the rating...."
5,I pod speakers,Great product. I would highly recommend. They were a Father's Day Gift and they arrived promptly w/room to spare. We use these all of the time!
5,SWEET!,"This is the best accessory I've purchased for my iPod. It had great sound, it's portable & I can easily take it to my office & home. I love it! I use my iPod more now that I have it!"
2,Worked for 2 weeks - Poor Customer Service,"I received this as a gift. It was purchased this through Amazon by way of Electronica Direct. Out of the box it was great. Plugged it in, fully charged, it lasted me over a week. When I tried to recharge it, nothing. It won't even play my ipod while plugged in.Now after 1 week waiting to be opened for my birthday and one week of use, I am haveing trouble just getting it exchanged. Electronica Direct said they don't help after 15days, Amazon told me to contact them.I am still waiting to hear from Sonic Impact."
5,Fabulous Sound,"Sonic Impact i-F2 Portable Speakers for iPod has a fabulous sound and its versatility allows me to use it at home, in the office and in the car. I recommend it very highly."
4,"So far , so good..","Just bought it today. [...] Intend to make this a 'rolling review.' Bought this for a forthcoming trip to sunny climes .So far so good. It was well packaged in the box. Has several holders for the various I Pods & as others have mentioned , a lead for other MP3 players. I was impressed with the plugs for the US/UK and Europe - a nice touch. It is on charge as I type , so I haven't played it. The one thing I wish it had was a radio - that would have made what appears to be a good product , a great one. As the charge time is 8 hours , I will update later.-------"
4,one small problem,"The product is excellent, but - it came with adaptors/holders for the IPOD, none of which fit???"
3,Maybe not the best buy...,"I suppose it's not entirely fair to write a review for this item since I have never tried it, but I thought I should share what I learned after I ordered it. I ordered this from a seller through Amazon and immediately got an email from them informing me that they had a return rate of over 50% on these speakers and lots of complaints. To me it sounds like if they work, they're great, but there's only a 50% chance of that happening. I'm not feeling lucky. I've canceled my Sonic Impact i-F2 order in favor of the Logitech mm50 speakers which also have a built-in battery and are similar in price."
2,Very disappointed,"I am a Peace Corps Volunteer currently serving in Central America. I ordered this product while home on leave, because I thought it would be a great travel item to have with me in the field. I was sorely disappointed to discover that after charging up the speakers for 8 hours as instructed, the internal lithium ion battery was either DOA or non-existent, because the system would not play without being plugged in. I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1 because the speaker system did work great when plugged in; my iPod mini fit in perfectly, and the quality of the sound was pretty darn good for such a small system. But because I bought this product for the portability, I decided to return it. From now on I think I will stick with big-name brands."
1,AWFUL EXPERIENCE,"I bought this to use with my nano on trips. THe first problem was the message on my nano when i docked it--""charging is unable with this accessory"". So it would not recharge my nano while playing so the battery would run out. THe last straw was when i just got the latest version nano and it would not play out of the speakers at all, and of course would not charge. I am done with this product."
4,Great sound for its size,"This unit is great for travel baring one slight problem. It houses everything in the unit (including the ipod) except the power cord,therefore only 4 stars. The case is very rugged and the sound is fantastic given its compact size. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an all in one unit for travel."
1,Flaw in Design,I bought this product last year and it has seen very little use. The connector where the ipod plugs in became loose and now it won't work. I'm trying to figure out how to fix it because it is hard to open up the unit. I've contacted the company about this but so far and they have not returned my e-mail. The unit sounded good for the price before it broke.
1,"Good sound, big flaw, too heavy to travel","These speakers sound good, but watch out -- the plug that fits into the iPod bottom is weak. I beat up another brand of speakers for years and they still worked well; these broke within a couple of months of very light and easy use. They're now useless, because you can't open the case to try a repair. The case also weighs quite a lot, but the speakers aren't any better than in lighter models."
2,I was dissappointed,It was just what I wanted. However the sound was scratchy and tried different songs just to be sure but to no avail. The company was great with the return and I would buy something from them again because they were quick to respond with Amazon's help.
1,SONIC IMPACT 5084,I purchased this for Valentines day 2007. It is 1 1/2 months later and the product is not working properly. You can hardly make the Ipod stay in the slot provided to play the music. I paid almost $100 for this item and it is poor to say the least
3,portability and price,"I bought these speakers to use at work. They are compact, ease to transport, and provide very good sound for there size."
5,Amazing,It was in amazing condition. It was brand new. I told a lot of people about the product and where I got it. I gave it to someone as a gift. They were very happy with it.
1,disappointed,This product not only did not play my touch ipod it wouldn't charge it and when I could get it to intermittently play the sound was not very good . i was very disappointed and returned the product. I am still waiting for my refund.
5,Super Cool Speakers!,I bought Sonic's portable speakers for my 14-year-old son. He has a friend who has had his own set of speakers for a few years now. My son and our whole family have enjoyed these speakers. We can now listen to all his cool music! No kidding! I know there are cheaper products like this now on the market. But the compact nature of this speaker system along with the very cool zip-up case has got to be the best on the market. My son can now securely take his Ipod and speakers anywhere he wants to go. I don't have to worry about him losing parts or breaking the speakers. This is great!
4,Sounds Great and it's easy to carry,For the moment I really like it.Have used it little for the moment so no problem of battery or deck happened.It has great sound!
4,really nifty,"i find these speakers very easy to travel with; they fit in a briefcase [not too heavy] or luggage. the extreme portability and good sound, make them an ideal way to share podcast audio/music with a larger audience. i also really like how slick they look with the black ipod. the remote, and how it fits neatly inside the speakers is also a really cool touch. it's quite a nice visual presentation!"
3,Handy but...,Great product. We bought this to use at the beach. Works and sounds great...if you are standing/sitting right in front of it. If you are any where off to the side you really can't hear it very well. Also the charge DOES NOT last nearly as long as it says. I think we get about 3-4 hours. NOT 15.Love the little storage compartment for the ipod. Just wish it had one for the charger as well.
1,Refurbished Arrived Broken,Bought this refurbished for $60 and it arrived broken. Wouldn't charge battery and wouldn't play unless plugged in. Called Sonic Impact who said they couldn't help me because it was purchased refurbished. Called Amazon who could only allow me to return the product because it was refurbished. I think there is a lesson here.
4,engelbert's new one,"actually i never listened to any engelberts music untill i heard a track from this album on the radio and was impressed!!this is really a good vocal album with some ballads some country and some jazzy stuff great late night listening!!a bit simmilar to the rick astley album""portrait"".great stuff mr humperdink!"
2,Lukewarm,"I liked certain parts of this book very much.I was bored by others. I was expecting sharp, insightful, refreshing wisdom and got a lot of characterizations I had heard before. Overall, it was a decent book...just not what I had hoped for (that's my problem, not the author's).However, the pearls of wisdom Mr. Taylor shared were precious indeed. Here are a few excepts:""Today, gurus and hucksters fill our airwaves hawking CD's, seminars, and autographed pictures of Jesus claiming that they will bring immediate personal peace in five easy steps and three easy payments. For those who know the pain and struggle of an authentic search for peace, such claims are painful even to hear."" Pp. 11-12"
5,Every song all in one set. You can't beat that!,Love the Judds Collection. First two cds have all the hits. The third cd has studio work tapes. I was looking for a comprehensive Judds Collection and I found it here. Brings back memories from the 1980s when I went to see the Judds in concert. Really love their stuff.
2,Building XML Web Services for the Microsoft .Net Platform,This book is filled with errors.The examples do not work and the fixes and updates from the Microsoft web site are incomplete and do not work.
2,It's difficult to read...,"The book covers a lot of subjects. However, the author were not able to illustrate many subjects in a coherent way. In the end, you don't get much by reading the book."
3,Good book but a little confusing,"I teach .net technologies at UCSD, and I usually recomend Microsoft press books, but sometimes Microsoft misses the obvious simple samples that make understanding better. This book covers a lot but needs to be better organized."
1,Worse than anyone even says,"I've probably read 100 technical books, but this is the worst I've ever opened. The number of errors just kills me... Why people don't compile their code and THEN paste it into their book is beyond me... Chapter two has an example where you create a Console Application, then you're asked to rename the Service1 file, but the Console Application wizard creates a Console1 file (the Web Service wizard creates a Service1 file). These errors are just inexcusable and the errors and issues go on forever... The errata should be as large as the book itself. Even larger if they included an apology for all the mistakes. I'd be totally ashamed to have my name on this book. If you're curious, buy a used copy for $5 and see for yourself. Even at that price, you'll probably feel ripped off."
1,Very Disappointing,"I typically like the MS Press books when it comes to exploring new technologies. Not so with this book. Not only were there errors in most of the code examples, but Short's examples skipped over a number of details and steps that left you figuring them out on your own. Since the code didn't work anyway, I was left trying to figure out if my guesses were wrong or the code was. Buy the O'Reilly book."
3,Who edited this?,I was reviewing this book for use by some of the junior developers on my team who are SOAP/Web Services newbies.The editor missed enough to make the book annoying for a newbie trying to work with the samples. It just goes to show the value of a decent editor.Very disappointing.
5,#1 Desert-Island album,"I'm not kidding, this album is so flippin' good that you'll have to buy 3 copies of it because you'll be wearing out each copy in about 2 weeks! And I'm not just saying this because I just bought this album, or because I just discovered the awesomeness that is Ray Brown; this album has consistently been one of my favourites for about 20 YEARS!The groove it unsurpassable and the albums will put a smile on your face from beginning to end."
5,The BEST,"All the songs on this CD are AMAZING. Not one bad song, seriously. This is one of the few albums that you can listen to all the tracks without having to skip a song. Buy this CD before buying all his other CD's. You can trust me on this review, the only type of music I really enjoy is British pop/rock but I like this album. IF YOU LIKE MUSIC YOU'LL LIKE THIS."
5,Best Album by Marc Anthony,"I originally purchased this tape over eight years ago. I had a super long commute and it never left my car. Now that I no longer have a commute, or a tape deck in my truck for that matter, I decided to purchase the CD for in home use. And USE it I do. There are not a lot of songs on the CD but as the old saying goes its quality not quantity that counts. I own other Marc Anthony CD's but this is, by far, the best.Buy it and enjoy.L.L."
5,Good enough for the non-vegetarian,This is a great cookbook and you don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy it. I absolutely love this cookbook and I have not found one recipe I have been disappointed in.
5,"A great ""normal"" vegetarian cookbook",This book is truly awesome for great recipes that don't require bizarre ingredients you'll never use again. I turn to it time and time again for yumminess!
5,I can't believe I ever lived without this book,"I am a huge fan of all of Jeanne Lemlin cookbooks, and this is just another addition to my collection. I am not a vegetarian, but don't eat much meat. I like simple recipes, easy to find ingredients, a good balance of nutrition, and most of all, delicious recipes. Oh, and I really like it when just one dish fulfills all these needs and you don't need side dishes (keeping it simple).Jeanne Lemlin cookbooks all meet my criteria. Some of my favorite recipes from this particular book are: Spinach, Rice, and Feta Cheese Gratin; Couscous with Provencal Vegetables, and Curried Red Lentil Soup with Vegetables. There are many others I love, and many I haven't tried yet."
5,Healthy eating,"Having enjoyed this author's recipes from an old Gourmet magazine, I was delighted to find she had a book with more options. Many are quick to prepare, and all are full of good healthy eating."
3,Bone Eater,I actually enjoyed the movie. Not nearly as bad as most of the made for SCFI Channel movies. Kind of a silly western meets bad horror.
1,Special effects were done by elementary school students,"Wow, this movie really sucked eggs. Goofy-looking monster Indian skeleton chasing and disintegrating people. Dialogue was grade C movie tripe. Read all scathing reviews for more."
2,Kinda Crappy,"Looked interesting enough, but was I sorry I bought this instead of renting it. The special effects were horrible. The monster was more funny than anything. When the bone eater's horse would appear in a puff of smoke and the old western type music would start playing, it was more like a comedy. Bruce Boxleitner was ok. I saw Gil Gerard was in this and the actress that used to be on Hill Street Blues, I believe. I originally didn't recognize either one of them until I played the movie again. I would think they could find something much better to be in. I guess you take what you can get!"
4,A Real Thriller,"Despite its metaphysical bent, this is a real thriller and can be read strictly for the thrill, which it delivers. Information about Kabbalah is woven so effortlessly into the fabric of the thriller that you get a good ride, a good read, and a little education, too! There's some interesting reinterpretation of the Book of Revelations here, as well."
4,"THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY","Some of the mostly instrumental songs on this CD are dated and of the pre-rock instrumental style of the time. You may enjoy them or you may not. But there are a few good ones. The classic being the hit version of The Good The Bad And The Ugly. Far superior to the mediocre version heard in the Clint Eastwood movie. This haunting, original, beautifully conceived and recorded song was a #2 song in 1968, one of the few instrumentals to ever sell that well. If you download the song, you will miss out on the excellent sound quality and nuance of hearing it on CD. Hugo Montenegro was an innovator who was responsible for such advances as quadraphonic sound in the 1960s and 1970s. If you like eerie, unusual songs that are distinctive and that copycat no one, you may like THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY. Just realize the rest of the songs may leave you cold. But you are receiving it at a heavily discounted price."
4,Great movie!,Above The Rim is a great movie with outstanding acting by all the characters as well as a great plot. I'm sure many people will enjoy this movie. Check it out!
5,Its about Kyle and he gets in a wromg group of people.,Its about Kyle and he gets in a group of the wrong people. And he plays really good ball. And theres a shoot out and he was going to run with TuPac but he killed that bum I can't remember his name so he runs with his coach again and they win the championship and a guy on tupacs team trys to shoot Kyle but Sheppead Jumps in front of the Bullet. And at the end Tupac gets shot right in the chest so he dies and they show Kyle in NCAA and he makes the winning shot to win the game.
2,Tupac's tha man,"well,I expected mutch from this one.I tought it was something like boys 'n the hood,New Jack City and don't be a menace.But no,it was just a boring basketball movie.About a teenager who grows up in a bad hood.The only thing I liked in this movie was Tupac.With out him the movie would have been really stupid."
5,An early '94 Street Ball joint! (My name is O.!),"Now I never knew of this movie until my mom's friend gave me the soundtrack. It was vicious, and so I decided to check out the movie, but to this day, I never watched it! But I can tell it would be tight for kids who like basketball to watch, no matter if its Rated R. I criticize some other basketball movies. Love and BAsketball had a female cast, and it was too much mostly about love. HOosiers was stupid, back in the day where players basketball shorts were at their thys, and it was about the same thing: Dreams. Space Jam was tight. Above the Rim was not only good for the reasons I said, it had Tupac and Marlon Wayans in it. So I was interested."
4,Sleeper hit,"This is a good movie. It doesn't take it's self too serious and it's not corny either. I like the story, the acting was good too. This is a movie that you just chill too!"
5,a movie to see,"this was such a good movie and tupac was just great, too bad he couldnt have made some more movies this is a must see you wont be able to walk away please hurry up and get this on dvd we want to have a copy for home"
5,2pac is the greatest,"I think that every film that 2pac has been in was amazing. He is both an outstanding rapper and actor, and drop dead gorgeous. What more can you say, even if you don't like the film just looking at him is good enough."
2,terrible,This movie was terrible. The only reason im giving it any stars is because i love tupac but thats it.this movie basically has no story line. if you want to see a good tupac movie then you go buy juice. i think u will enjoy that alot more than u will in this movie
3,Pretty Good...,"This was a fairly good movie...reasonably realistic and generally entertaining. I'm a big basketball fan, so it was easy for me to enjoy."
3,This is NOT Hard-Anodized,"The description for this item suggests that its interior is hard anodized. It is, in fact, NON-STICK. As a non-stick pan, it's halfway decent, but I bought it presuming that it was a steal-of-a-deal hard anodized interior like the other Calphalon I own.Considering what I paid, I will keep it, but I'm disappointed that it wasn't what I ordered."
2,Not what I expected,"Much smaller and lighter than I expected. I own a set of Calphalon and all pieces are very heavy. It's like another reviewer indicated, its non-stick, not hard anodized. Price was right and probably not work sending back. I'll decide whether to keep or re-gift."
2,Calphalon at its worst.,"This would be a great pan if they left off the teflon coating. Nowhere in the ad is it mentioned that it is teflon. or at least it didn't when I ordered. So they take a pan that should last nearly forever and coat it so that it will last a year or two, maybe."
2,Inaccurate Description,"When I ordered this item in February it was titled ""Calphalon Simply Hard Anodized 3-Quart Chef's Skillet"", which led me to believe that it was NOT a non-stick pan. I like Calphlon, but prefer to buy the hard anodized to the non-stick. I returned the pan for a replacement, thinking that Amazon had made a mistake. The non-stick replacement pan was also returned. Beware the descriptions - they're not always accurate."
5,i love this skillet,"what I like most about it is that I am able to use very little oil for sauteing, and I can use it in the oven for making steaks!"
4,A convenient and useful item,"I bought a full size Aerobed about 2.5 years ago for about $125- $145 on amazon. I'm not sure it was the ""comforter"" bed though. With a one bedroom urban apartment, the Aerobed was really a convenient thing to have for guests. I think it is comfortable and I slept on it several times myself when I brought it on excursions. I liked how it inflated quickly and easily.A few months ago I lent it to a friend who needed a new bed. After a few months it sprung a leak. I guess that's to be expected eventually, especially with regular every day use. If it weren't for that I'd give it 5 stars since I think it's a nice, high quality, and cost effective invention. We did manage to get it patched by putting it under water in the tub slightly inflated, squeezing it and seeing where the air bubbles come up to identify the leak (and then patch it). NB: Make sure it you try this at that the bed it unplugged (or you could electrocute yourself)!!!"
4,Easy and comfortable,"I'm very happy with this air bed. It inflates and deflates very quickly. Storage is easy because it comes with a nice wheeled bag that fits the bed, the comforter, and the pump. My boyfriend and I had been previously using a Coleman air bed, and we both preferred this one. We didn't notice any loss of air for the week that we used it. The comforter is essentially a fitted sheet with a fleece blanket that zips onto it. It's nothing special, but you don't have to buy new sheets if you don't already have sheets in this size."
3,great gift for fan,"My mom is an Ohio State alum and long-time athletics fan. I haven't used these golf balls, but together with other golf accessories, they make a nice gift package. Only giving three stars on this review since I don't know how they perform."
1,Junk don't buy this,"It is a peace of junk, poorly made, the switch only works when it wants, I thru the whole thing in the trash"
5,works fine,Is not the most expensive level I have but it does exactly what I want it to do. workman ship is good.
4,Bizarre Mix,"There's a strange mix of old style (jazzy beats, sense of humor) and a more contemporary style (repetitive r and b tinged thug beats with thug lyrics) that has me programming half this album out. How the final two tracks, one an ode to gettin' benjamins and the other an uplifting ode to black culture, ended up on the same album is a mystery.Despite the inconsistency, I rate this 4 stars because it's Dres, the finest flowing lyricist ever, an MC who puts thought and heart into what he's saying. Dump the thug tracks and this record feels like a rainy night drive through a deserted downtown, with ambulance lights coming around the corner."
2,Small and not quite as advertised,"I purchased this bag and promptly had to return it because several things about it were pretty lousy (and falsely advertised, IMHO):1) My laptop with a 14-inch screen did not fit well.2) The area for accessories expanded zero inches, making it impossible for me to actually fit anything in there aside from a couple of CDs, a flash drive, and my chapstick.3) When I tried to pack in my power cord in that area, I couldn't close the clip on the front.4) The water bottle holder is a myth. Unless there's an extremely slimline water bottle out there that I've never come across. The limited amount of meshing and lack of elasticity offers no expandability of the space, meaning that none of my bottles fit. And I tried just about everything, including the teeny 8-oz Dasani bottles.Keep all this in mind before purchasing, folks! The good things? The bag sure looks pretty and has plenty of padding."
5,A FUSION OF MUSICAL GENIUSES!,"Im giving this CD 5 stars. One word to describe it...AWESOME!!!This CD is an incredible mix of blues, soul, funk, and jazz. It is soo ingeniously mixed together. Burt Conrad has such a soulful poetic style. My favorite song is Lost Essence...this song and the CD will soothe your soul...IT'S INFECTIOUS!! I can't stop listening to it, and can't wait till the next one comes out. Its a must have to your collection!!"
4,EXTREMELY CHALLENGING,"This is a good game that takes a very long time. the replay value is very poor (because it is sooooo HARD) but all other aspects are good. you must go through a variety of worlds rescung pao pao park from pinki, an evil minded baby. this game is worth the money."
5,Perfect all 'round Guide,I purchased this guide for my son and he has already put it to good use identifing several plants and insects around our property. This book contains drawn illustrations as well as color photos. It also contains a break down with illustations of the different parts of various plants. I found this to be a very educational and handy book that would be good for anyone over about 8 years of age.
4,He is a prophet,"After the September 11th, 2001 Terrorist Attack, do all those who gave so called "" Kooky reviews"" still think he is a kook? I beleive that David Wilkerson is a prophet of God. He predicted this to happen."
1,"Trust me, it's kooky","This book is so full of mis-predictions and obvious extrapolations that it should forever have ruined Wilkerson's status as a man to be listened to. That it did not says a lot about modern Christianity. Contrary to what is said below, Wilkerson didn't say that porn would become available through technology, implying that he for-saw the internet, but through TV. The other claim of his prediction that are ""eerily becoming true"" are similarly distorted. What he did say was that the US would suffer an enormous earthquake outside of the usual quake areas that would be so severe that earthquakes would become the leading cause of fear in the general population, that the economy would become so unstable that no one would ever feel confident in it again, and that rural property would so sky-rocket in price that only the syndicates would be able to afford it. I don't remember, did ANY of that happen?"
3,will do for the price,"Two complaints with this bra. 1. The bottom wrinkles and curls up. Not comfortable and effects the fit. 2. Since I am short the adjustable straps did not adjust enough and the wear and tear on the bar caused it to give almost no support towards the end. This being said I have used it for about one year. For heavy cardio, kickboxing and running I would add a cheap target champion bar as well."
4,"Good support, but could always have more.","I have this in 36DD and I disagree that it runs small. I think people think it is small because of how awkward it is to get the bra on and off. Once you get it on, it is perfect, although I still could do with more support. I got mine at $18 at Target (not on sale), so I suggest that everyone should get theirs there too, since its a fair amount cheaper there."
5,This bra rocks!,"This bra is comfortable working out or not. I am a 34D and wore it for a day to see if it's comfortable enough to work out in, then wore it for a long run today and it was great. Once you get it on and situated, prepare not to worry about bounce, and just enjoy the workout! Very true to size."
4,Found my sports bra!,"I wear a 36DD and do high impact workouts (combat, step class, running). I am over 40, so do still wear an over-the-head, non cup size sports bra over this since I'm not as ""perky"" as once was. I have tried bra after bra, including $60+ versions. This has been my go-to bra for two years, and I won't workout without it now! It does slip over the head and require fastening. This was difficult when I had a shoulder injury, but I have no trouble with it now - you get used to it."
2,Ancient Torture Device!,"This bra does a very good job of ""keeping everything in place"" however, it is painful to wear for long periods of time, and putting it on? Well, that requires body contortionist moves. It does have a hook on the back that comes apart, however the racerback cross one inch above it does not, rendering it almost useless. I can tolerate it for short periods of time, but I don't like it at all."
2,"Good, but Not The Best","I didn't have trouble putting this bra on. Hook it beforehand and put it on over-head like a t-shirt. Very easy to reach back to unhook and take it off the same way. If you want to take it off without unhooking it, good luck. That was next to impossible. I tried it and felt like it would rip the fabric of the bra, I had to tug at it that hard. It provided decent support for my 40DD girls and it was fairly comfortable, but something was just off. It didn't feel like a good fit. If you want support AND comfort in a great looking bra, I'd go with this one:Saucony Motion Sensor Sports Running Bra"
4,Not bad for the price,"I must have an underwire in my bras (sports or regular) to keep my 'girls' seperated. This bra does the job nicely. I wore it on a 1/2 hour bike ride the day I got it (without washing it first) and noticed that the fabric was pretty stiff. However, after only the first wash, it feels much better and is much more comfortable. The back is akward though, so that does get some getting used to. I usually end up putting it on backwards (without my arm through the holes), clasping the three claps, turning it to the right side and pulling it up/putting my arms through to get it on. Because of the weird design, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5....just a tad combersome to put on, but otherwise a great bra for a larger chest. But please note that for those of you who might care, it is only lightly lined and any headlights will shine through."
4,exactly what I expected.,"I was tired of the uniboob look. This lifts, separates and supports the girls just like I wanted, whether it is a class, run, hike or walk. Would definitely recommend."
2,Back Fat Explosion,"Totally horrible back fat explosion. So bad, so utterly mortifying. I had to return this bra.It would be a great bra if back fat wasn't an issue for you."
5,Love it!,"Holds everything in place!! Great support, great price -- just started running a couple of months ago -- I've purchased two of these so far and plan to get more."
4,Good support,"I ordered a size larger after reading all of the reviews & I wish I hadn't! It works... but it is a little too roomy on me. I ordered another in my ""normal"" size & it is much better! Still some movement, but works better than most!"
1,Don't bother with this one!,Although....once on--the support is great--there is no way to get this on unless you are a contortionist! It must be slipped over the head with arms through straps first....and remember this is a support bra...then--if you are double jointed...you may be able to reach around the back and fasten the band at bottom....ugh--I bet this was designed by a guy!
3,Low Impact,"The bra isn't too hard to get on, but you do have to pull it over your head.I like to have some ""compression"" to hold the breasts in place when working out. There is none. IF they had put a thicker fabric on the cups it would be much better to cover nipples.I do like the criss cross in the back."
1,Can't get it on alone,"This bra was crazy to put on. It is a t strap in back but it does not have a hook to open the bra. I do have to say the cup was well fitted, but the underwire poked on outside of breast."
3,Not quite the right one,"The fit is okay, but the fabric is thin enough to make the nipple visible even trough the tank top over it. That's not my thing. Also pre-shaped cups don't always fit ones anatomy. Perhaps I could have gone down a cup size. Well, I have already returned it."
4,"Great bra, especially for large busted women!","This is the best bra I have found so far for support, shoulder comfort, form, and price. It can be a bit hard to get off if you aren't flexible, but it is worth it! I found this bra to cost %30 less here on Amazon as well, which was great!"
5,excellent sports bra for large busted women,"i have found this sports bra to be a very comfortable bra to wear during my workout sessions. i am so glad i purchased 2 of them. i would recommend this sports bra to any other women who are a bit larger on the top. so nice not to have my ""gals"" all over the place while doing my cardio workout. :o)"
5,Best sports bra ever,A little snug to put on but keeps the girls snug and non-moving during physical activity like running and kick boxing. Great bra.
4,"Great support, hard to don and doff","This bra is pretty,very supportive and allows you to wear shirts which cut in at the shoulders. The only problem I have with it is getting it on and taking it off. It does not open up completely in the back, it just unlatches, so it takes some work to hook."
1,very disappointed,I am extremely disapointed with this bra. The cups are not padded! so you might as well not wear a bra as nipplescan be seen.
2,Dial 911 to get it off,"It was pretty hard to get on, but omg, I thought I'd have to dial 911 to get the thing off. I bought this and a Bali Comfort bra(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00550PUNC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title)... to relieve strap irritation, but this one was not the answer. The Bali Comfort Bra is great, but this sucker is going back to Amazon!"
2,Great support but impossible to take on or off,"The Bra gives perfect support, once you have broken your arms and have it on. Then the struggle of taking it off starts. Too me it was too much hassle to do that and I returned it. I am still looking for this kind of support but an easier way to put it on or take it off."
4,Great but hook placement needs a redesign.,This would be a 5 star review had the manufacturer realized the clasps on the back are a total pain to reach. I (just last week) bought my bra true to size (38D) after reading the reviews that they run a tad small. I like the sports bra to be a little tight (I was wearing 2 before!).This morning I put this thing on already clasped and squeezed them to make sure they didn't unhook while I put it on. That worked better than popping my shoulder joints out to hook it while on.I'm glad I don't have to wear 2 bras anymore! I'll probably get another one but Champion really needs to assess the hook situation.
2,Horribly uncomfortable,It's difficult to get on/off. It chaffed my skin all around the bottom of the bra. It does not have good motion control for sports like running. Very uncomfortable. Don't buy it!
4,Great support!,"Great support! The only reason I didn't give this bra 5 stars is that despite it being a racer back, it has a hook/eye closure in the back. I find hooking the bra behind my back a little tricky, and often rely on my husband for help."
2,Not for well endowed women; difficult to put on,"First off, let me say that the material of this bra is silky which definitely isn't an attribute I want in a sports bra. It's difficult to take off and on, and the support is minimal. I am a 36DD, and I get better support in some of my regular bras. The sizing was large in my opinion, so I should have gone down one band size. I ended up ordering the "" Moving Comfort - Juno "" and I am very happy with that purchase."
1,Extremely Poor Customer Service,Customer service is definately lacking at NY Lingerie. In my attempt to return the product I was treated very unprofessionally. Advised in an antagonistic manner and not treated fairly. I paid to have the item shipped to me and paid again to return it. No electronic return label or credit was offered. I had to eat the second shipping charge. I will never use this vendor again.THE PRODUCT IS FINE - CUSTOMER SERVICE LACKING!
2,Worth a torn rotator cuff?,"This bra is both a pullover AND triple hook closure. Once I squeezed my shoulders through, smashing my breasts with the underwire in the process, I nearly dislocated my shoulders trying to hook the clasps! I had to be satisfied with two hooks because I never did get the third. Of course it provided great support on my four-mile run. Removing it when both the bra and my body were sweaty was nearly impossible; both difficult and painful. For smaller breasts or more flexible women this might be a good choice; I am a reasonably fit 34DD. Even if you had help to put it on and take it off, you are in for a chore. Champion has other choices that provide the support without the risk (try double dry spot comfort full support). This one is going back."
3,"Decent Support, Awful Comfort","This bra has decent support, but as other reviewers have mentioned it is very difficult to put on and off. It's also very uncomfortable--the side wires poke in certain positions. My 14 year old daughter wears a bra 24/7 and this is the first bra she's not been able to sleep in. She also says that while it's OK for competitive trampoline training, it's not comfortable during certain conditioning training--such as pushups, situps, crunches, etc. because it pinches. Also she says it's very very hot and doesn't seem to breathe at all. I bought this as an everyday bra for her on a trial basis after she outgrew her last bras. If she liked it I was going to buy her more of them. Since she was left with only this bra she decided to sleep braless for the first time since she was 11."
2,great bra-hard to get on-which makes for a bad review,"supportsattractive bralifts and separates, but in a kind wayI have a hard time connecting the back snaps. I am not flexible enough to snap them after bra is on, and if I try to snap them then get it on, I cannot get it over my head.major design flaw, unless there is some set of instructions that I neglected."
1,POWERBACK SPORTS BRA,"DESIGN WAS INPOSSIBLE TO GET ON FOR A 42D CUSTOMERSPEC WAS NOT TRUE TO SIZE AS INDUSTRY BRANDS LIKEBALI , NATORI ETC ...."
2,hard to get on!,"Unless you're incredibly flexible, this is a tough one to get on over your head and get hooked.With a bad back...forget about it!"
1,Underwire,"I don't like underwire...especially in a sports bra, they bind and pinch me. I find them uncomfortable to wear at the gym."
4,Sports bra,This bra Runs a bit small. It seems very supportive and has a nice look. I had to order a 34 DD) I also ordered the Saucony sports Bra which I like a little better (I ordered a 34d)
5,Best sports bra I've ever had,"After trying various sport bras, this one is the best. I use it for cycling to work every day. Great support and you don't feel the wires or hooks in back. Vents well, only downside is that it is hard to put on! I use to need my husband's help every day to do the back hooks, but needed to do it myself in order to change at work to go home. It is still hard to do, but worth it. I have one that is a size up and one my correct size. These do run small, I wear a 32 and I like the 34 better."
4,Tighter than expected,"The bra fits, is as supportive as I expected (not a lot of room for wiggle or bounce, thus good for running) but it is a little challenging to put on as other reviewers have mentioned, and the underwire is a bit tight. But it does its job."
2,good support but...,"this workout bra has a good/true fit with good support and eliminates the uni-boob, but needs to have some padding. looked like headlights are on, and thin workout gear would not hide it."
5,Rima,Champion training underwire bra was gr8 sturdy abd reliable. I recommend it to all customers interested. I wanna but the white color soon
5,Justo,"El Producto de excelente calidad, la entrega a tiempo. Excelente compra cumplio mis espectativas completamente. Recomendado ampliamente. Talla y modelo perfectas. ok"
3,Should have ordered my size,"I've lost a bit of weight lately, and been wearing more 36DD than my old size of 38DD in most brands. Given the reviews recommending this runs small, I ordered the larger 38DD size. I really should have gone with the smaller size, as the 38DD just feel a tad loose and I jiggle more than I like just walking across the room. Unfortunately, I've already worn it too much (and took the tags off), so no return for me. Oh well, risk I run living somewhere far away from anywhere I could possibly try sports bras on at in person.I'll probably keep it around and use it for non-sports and lower impact related wear, and try again after my weight has stabilized and I know what my new size will be. Everything else on this bra feels like it's top notch!"
2,The bra runs a size smaller,I purchase a 36 DD and couldn't close the back. Cups size are not larger enough. Get a size up.
3,Difficult to put on and take off,"This bra is way too difficult to put on and to take off. I had to have my hubby help me put it on to workout and I also had to have his help to take the bra off. I purchased the 32D and but really needed a 28 or 30 band size but Champion doesn't carry smaller band sizes. I also had to take the underwires out of the bra as they were uncomfortable. Once you are able to get it on and take the underwires out of the bra, it is pretty comfortable and sturdy so I gave it 3 stars for being comfortable and sturdy. If my husband or no one else is around to help me put the bra on or take it off on the days I want to work out, it is just too much trouble so I have to find another workout bra to wear that those days.I'll keep looking for another good workout bra."
2,Not enough support/restriction,"When I buy a sports bra it's because I want it to hold me steady when I'm running on the treadmill. This item did not do that. I have to wear another sports bra over top of it to get that holding down effect. The second thing I want in a sports bra is boob seperation, I'll give it a great on this task. The underwire is pretty comfortable and seperates nicely. Lastly, I get underwire because i don't want my boobs to touch my stomach (is this TMI?). The underwire on this bra does an ok job of this, not great. It's better with the sports bra over top of it.Lastly, before I dig too hard on this bra, I think I either ordered a size too big (i ordered my actual bra size) or lost a little weight before it got to me (NOT LIKELY). I should have ordered a smaller size and that may have been more supportive and restrictive. So my suggestion, if you get this bra is to buy a size or two smaller than your current bra size."
3,Racerback bra hurts my neck and shoulders!,"I still have to wear another sports bra or bra top with this bra. My breasts don't bounce around a lot when wearing this, but the weight of my breasts feels like it is being supported around the top of my neck. Wearing an additional sports bra or bra top helps but does not elimiate this discomfort. Go with a moving comfort bra if you have a larger cup size."
3,you'll need nipple concealers,"I'm a 36dd. I like how it separates. There is virtually no bounce, but there is also no padding so when it gets cold, it shows EVERYTHING. I just used some nipple concealers and they work just fine. Everything else is good. Occasionally it will chafe.Its pretty easy to put on. i just slip it over and then hook it."
5,D-cup & Racerback!,Great sports bra for larger breasted women...AND it has the racerback! Awesome for high impact sports - I use it for tennis.
1,IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT ON BY YOURSELF,"Obviously I am not Timothy - I'm his wife. I've never owned a bra I couldn't put on my myself until now. It's tight fitting like a sports bra should be but there is no way to hook the strap and slip it over your head. I have to slip it over my head first and then ask my husband to hook it for me. So ladies, if you live alone, do not get this bra - you will never get it closed."
3,You'll injure yourself trying to fasten the hooks!,"I wasn't sure what kind of overall rating to give this product. Although the support is awesome and the materials are excellent, it has a solid racer-back style PLUS rows of hooks. This means you have to stretch it to get over your torso while your bosoms are squished in different directions, rearrange everything in front, and then you need someone else to go back and hook the hooks for you (unless you're lucky enough to be double jointed.) When I was 20, I think I could have managed to reach the hooks unaided. However, when I was 20, I didn't require Nobel-prize-winning feats of engineering to give me the support that I need now in my 40s."
4,Perfect for high impact sports,"This is perfect for high impact sports, there's almost no bouncing, I have a large breast 34DD and works very nice for me.The only problem is to put it on...and out, but it totally worth it."
3,Could have been a great bra,"Great styling. It could have been exactly what I have been searching for for months. I wear a 36DD in regular bras and fit perfectly in a 38DD in this one. This is a bearcat to get into. If you can put your bra on from the front and reach your arms around to fasten it, then you will be okay with this one. I have great flexibility in my shoulders, elbows and wrists and COULD NOT get this one fastened."
2,"Not enough support, uncomfortable","I bought this bra because of the good reviews. Being a 36 DD, it is hard to find the perfect sports bra that can carry the weight of my DD's and provide movement control. I bought the 36D to get the tightness, but it still felt too big-probably due to the fact that the straps were too long and there wasn't much room for adjustment at all. I really like the look of this bra, but just by putting it on and jumping I realized that it wasn't going to provide the support I needed. The back is uncomfortable-felt like something was digging into my skin, like rough fabric."
2,Not for mne,I returned this product. Front was comfortable but the back did not like at all.What is wronjg with a regular back closure.
3,Nice...,"I had high hopes for this but was somewhat disappointed. I guess I just thought I had found the miracle sports bra that would control my boobs for once. Alas, it is only fair. Maybe, if I had a smaller size it would be tighter and control better, but that wouldn't be my true size. Overall it is a good sports bra that seems more a medium impact than high impact. So running junkies may want to go a little smaller than your regular size to get better control."
1,"Chafes, not comfortable","I went for a 5 mile run and felt the top of the underwires digging into the center of my chest. After my workout, I was appalled to find that my skin was chafed and bruised in that spot (never happened with a sports bra!).It's otherwise true to size--wider in the band than I'd expected (I'm between band sizes, so I ordered up) and supportive, just that I've never used the bra again, since there's still a dark mark where the underwire wore at my skin."
5,Great Support,"I love, love, love this sports bra. It's really attractive under my workout clothes and very supportive. It's a bit hard to put on because it is a semi-one piece bra that also has a traditional hook in the back. You need to be flexible enough to reach back an pull it down because the bra is made of strong, rigid fabric. I bought my regular bra size and I want to purchase another because it holds me all together and looks really feminine. I give it 5 stars even if it's not the softest sports bra around. I highly recommend this bra for D's and DD's because your girls stay in place."
5,Fantastic sports bra,"This is what a sports bra is supposed to look and feel like! I am thrilled to have found it. When I am at the gym, running on a machine, I do not want my 36D chest bouncing around, and I don't want it squashed into a uni-boob either. This bra gives you firm control, but doesn't give you that odd front lump. I love this bra!! I plan to get several more, in different colors."
4,I love this bra,I love this bra.. I have big breast(40DD)so it's very hard to find a good sports bra. This bra does a very good job at controlling bounce and it's comfortable. The only problem I had was getting the bra on and off.
4,Comfortable and Great Support!,I am very busty that this sports bra has amazing support and feels great on. Great bra for a great price!
5,I love this Bra!,"I love this bra! I started running for a 5K and needed a new bra, my others needed to be retired! I looked for my old running bra but saw this one. I always have a hard time finding a running bra to give me good support and minimal bounce. I orginally ordered a 36DD after reading some reviews that the cup size was a little small (I am normally 36D). I ended up sending that one back for a 34DD because the band was too big. This one fits perfect and gives me great support. It is a bit funny gettting it on! I am definitely going to order another one."
3,Good but very hard,"I bought this bra because I have the one with no underwires, which I love!! However this one with the underwires is very hard to put on and take off. Other than that it gives me the support that I want which is good."
2,sizing is offf,"the point of a sport bra is for it to be tight, not to wear it like a t-shirt. sizing is way offf"
3,"Super supportive, but tricky to put on.","This bra is very well made, and it is very supportive. However, the design requires some odd twisting and turning to close the back hooks. That said, it is well worth it for its great function."
3,Thoughts,"The bra itself is very uncomfortable to put on and it has no give. Meaning that it does not stretch. It does cover the full cup size and it is designed for a size cup higher than usual. I am a C cup and I ordered a D cup. That was fine, but I am going to keep looking for another option!"
3,"hard to get on, underwire rubs in the center, nice shape and support",The title pretty much says it all. I'm a 32C and I bought this bra and one by Moving Comfort to compare. They both ended up being just OK.The good: This bra offers excellent support while still letting me look like a woman. I have a set of boobs rather than a flat uniboob which is the shape I got from the Moving Comfort bra. The underwire stays nice and snug against my body.The meh: The racerback construction makes the bra a little difficult to get into. But not a big deal.The bad: The underwire is rubbing me raw in the upper center part of the bra and I haven't even gone to the gym yet. I hate to return the bra since the fit is otherwise good. I will try stitching some soft fabric on the inside of the bra at that spot to see if it helps.
4,Great deal for the price!,"Great price for this bra. Other reviewers were correct, it is extremely difficult to hook in the back. I ended up hooking it first, then wiggling in. Also, one of the hooks is already bent from me trying to hook it in the back when I couldn't see what I was doing, I guess ( the reason for only 4 stars). That said, it gives amazing support and I wear for spin and yoga classes back to back. I did find that it fit true to size and that it loosened/softened up a bit after washing. One curious thing though, I ordered a second one on the day I received the first and the price was higher - and that was only a few days later."
3,Too difficult to get on!,Great support for any girl with a large cup-size but you have to be double jointed to get it on easily! I try to only wear it for longer runs to make it worth the trouble of getting on and off. It makes me want to take up yoga so I can be more flexible.
4,"Good Bra, not so hard to put on either.","I got this bra because I'm a chesty lady, and I really do need the support. I read a bunch of reviews that made me kind of nervous that this bra would be very hard to put on and take off. If you can put your arms over your head, and are capable of hooking 3 bra hooks behind yourself, you'll be fine."
2,Hard to put on,I could not get this bra over my head and shoulders. I returned it and got a different champion sports bra.
4,"Racer back, runs small","Be sure you know this has a racer back, and it runs small. Also, it is difficult to get on, over the head, and to then fasten and unfasten. Once on, it is a great sports bra for large breasted women. It fits tightly and is very supportive. The black is nice."
3,This bra is a problem to put it on and off as it has no openings and one must put it on over their head.,Very difficult to put this bra on; no openings. Once the struggle is over and is on it fits quite well. Then on struggles to take it off.
2,RUNS EXTREMELY SMALL,I am a TRUE DD but this only fits about a C cup! It's a great bra but too small
4,Very pleased!,"This bra is great! It gives me full coverage and is comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that is cris/crosses in the back and in order to get in the bra, you must slip in on over your head instead of just putting it on and fastening it. It can be a little difficult to put on and take off. Other than that, I recommend it."
2,Difficult to put on,"I was very dissapointed with this bra difficult to put on it does not come apart basically a pull on style with a clasp. It gives little support and cups provides no compression. I purchased 34DD. This style may be ok for A/B cups, those requiring little support and having very narrow shoulders in order to pull over the head!"
5,The best,"I bought this bra for the gym and I just bought 2 more. True, it's not easy to put on, but it's worth the struggle. Nice and secure and takes the weight off my shoulders."
3,I like it and it is comfortable once you get it on. I cannot manage to clasp from the back which is manditory.,I didn't look at it closely enouogh and didn't realize that it must be clasped from the back.I think anyone who normally clasps their bra from the back would like it.
2,Are you into contortion?,"This is really hard to get in and out of, and once you're in you'll be high-beaming everybody at the gym, as the cups are thin."
2,So disappointed...,"I bought this bra because Champion no longer makes the bra that I love - so I tried to replace it with another Champion bra. This bra is so difficult to put on and remove that I literally had to recruit my husband to help both times I wore it! It has a powerback and hooks - it must be donned over the head then hooked in back. Trying to pull a fitted, not too stretchy bra with a ton of underwire around the shoulders and over the breasts then hook it behind the back is just too much trouble! The support is good, although it doesn't fit me nearly as well as the old Champion model. Unfortunately, this will not be the new favorite Champion bra that I was hoping for."
1,USER FRIENDLY NOT!!!!,"VERY, VERY difficult to get on and off....back hook and eye but must slide all over head to fit... a ""contraption"" at best... poor length in straps etc. etc. Would definitely NOT recommend"
1,Impossible!,"I've figured this out, that you actually have to hook the enclosure and then put it over your head and somehow pull it down over your bust if you want it on, and then you can unhook it from behind and take it off (but you can't put it on and then hook it). Someone else said they figured a man must have designed this. I laughed because that's exactly what I said (along with some mild swearing) when I was trying to get it on. It's ridiculous. Wish I'd read the others reviews. Do not buy this bra!!"
2,Biography of the Sadhu Sundar Singh,"Of the several biographical accounts written concerning the Christian Sadhu (Holy Man) Sundar Singh, this one is the one with which Sundar Singh himself was least satisfied. While the factual information in the book is, for the most part, accurate, the authors failed to truly understand the man about whom they were writing. Because of this, the picture that is painted of the Sadhu is fundamentally flawed and inaccurate. Sundar Singh himself regarded the biography by Mrs. Parker to be the best such work. There has been at least one biographical work written since his death as well."
3,I used to use this...,"but had to stop after doing a rotation diet and finding out how very sensitive I am to soy. They use soy-derived Vitamin E as a preservative in their capsules. I am sad to say that even this tiny bit of soy is enough to negatively affect my system.If you are implementing a gluten/casein/soy free diet with an autistic child, you will probably need to remove this supplement and find a different one.That is my only true concern and counter-recommendation for the product."
5,must have guide,"THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE FOR CHEVY LOVERS WHO BUY ON EBAY OR GO TO SWAP MEETS, IT WILL KEEP YOU FROM BUYING A MISTAKE AND WILL HELP YOU FIND A GREAT DEAL"
3,Walked away still hungry...,"3 or 4 good songs - Rob Schneider has become an absolute studio whiz - surrounded by a lot of filler. I wish to remind The Apples and Olivia Tremor Control that my CD player (and everyone else's) allows me to cut out all these ""interesting"" noises posing as songs that you commit to record - in other words, don't bother, because I'm not listening."
2,"Kind of boring, lackluster effort","Jeez, why did they release this stuff? I wished they had held on to the best songs here until they had some more good songs for a full-length album. Sure it's an EP, but even this is short for an EP. The songs are not as well produced or thought out as as Tone Soul Evolution. I almost feel ripped off! The Elephant 6 Beatlesesque songs are great when they are good songs with good production, but when they aren't they sure are tiring."
3,"Good, not great","I'm sorry, but some of these reviews seem really biased. Yes, there are one, maybe two good songs on here, but is really the greatest record since Skylarking or somthing like that? Hardly. I wanted to like this way more than I did. I would direct anyone to Tone Soul Evolution or Fun Trick Noisemaker first. This record is another in a series of disappointments from Elephant Six. Seriously, I can't get into this or Black Foliage. Truthfully, I feel this is an okay release (better than OTC's newest), and I'll buy their next record, but the best in '99? Hardly."
3,Know what you're getting...,"The songs are really good, but after you cut out all the random weird tracks, you're only left with seven songs totalling 21 minutes. That's it."
3,"Pleasant Enough Stopgap, But It's No Tone Soul Evolution","Pop Kulcher Review: This is a brief EP meant to hold fans over while waiting for the band's next full-length album. Their 1998 release, Tone Soul Evolution, was a feast of wonderful pop music for fans of the Beatles' Revolver and the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, with loads of well-produced, hook-filled melodies. Her Wallpaper Reverie isn't in the same league. There are a handful of songs, interspersed with some silly sound effects and instrumental doodling (so don't be misled by the apparently lengthy list of songs on the album cover). It's not bad -- ""Ruby"" would have fit in fine on Tone Soul, as would drummer Hilarie Sidney's ""Questions and Answers."" But if the band really felt the need to rush out an EP rather than just waiting for the next album to be finished, you'd think they'd have stronger material to offer."
3,Heaven and Hell,"Beautiful, lushly produced pop songs! Annoying melody awkwardly played on a child's xylophone. Sweet and sour. See the music fan from Boston's comments, they're right on the money. I have also programmed my CD player to skip over the soundscapes. Sadly, I was left with only twenty-one minutes of music. Neutral Milk Hotel dropped the instrumental filler which marred their debut from their follow up ""In an Airplane over the Sea"". Apples would be advised to do likewise. As for Olivia Tremor Control: they seem to have forgotten how to write pop songs so little remains but their lazy instrumental explorations."
3,Good songs but too few,"I got this Cd because I liked the two Cds ""Fun Trick Noisemaker"" and ""tone soul evolution"" and that I had heard the songs on it were the best so far. When I listened to the Cd I was disappointed, the songs that were there were indeed very good, but there were too few and the Cd was too brief. The Apples attempt to sound like Olivia Tremor Control with the artistic sounds didnt work for such a short EP, and the fact that they all sounded the same. But the songs that are there are very good, heavily influenced by the Kinks and the Beatles. A good Cd but shouldnt be priced over $5."
3,Is a CD worth it for 3 Good songs?,"Hey, I just wanted to say that when I first heard this disc, Someone played me 3 of the songs on it. I thought it was wonderful, full of wonderful effects and recording tricks. Beautiful voices and great tone. The melody really soaked right in too. But when I got home and listened to it on Headphones, it gave me a headache because of all that Horrible soundscaping like ""The APples inStereo Theme"". I can not stand ""trippy"" stuff like that. I wish they wouldnt' have tried to make a concept EP because they were on the right track to hooking a good fan, but I just listen to the 3. Worth it for 5 bucks."
2,fair,"The item arrived to us the week of Christmas three weeks after we had ordered it. It arrived with several broken and several missing parts. Amazon would not send us new parts, they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first. This was to be a Christmas gift to my son, so that was not optional. Had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would I would have had time to return it."
5,Outstanding purchase! Gotta have one of these!,"We purchased this child's ATV 3 summers ago and it is still going strong. It was for the 3 1/2 yr old grandson at the time. Now his ""almost"" 3 yr old sister drives it. She throws it into 2nd gear and flies around the farm.(you have to put a sand bag or ""shot"" bag in the rear storage compartment for a 30 lb child to get traction). I'm not kidding about the speed... it will easily keep up with a jogger. The kids stay with us extensively during the summer months and the ATV gets a workout.The battery charge is everything I would expect. With mild up and down slopes, I would guess 1 1/2 to 2 hours of run time after 3 years of use. At least 8 miles per charge.This is probably the best purchase for the kids that we have ever made. Wouldn't hesitate buying it again."
4,"Dated, but has some useful information","This book was originally published in 1943, and reprinted by Dover in 1975 minus some outdated information concerning ornithological clubs. Well written and easy to read, the book outlines the various aspects of birding, everything from bird migrations and bird banding to the art of bird watching. Unfortunately, since 1975, much of what is discussed has also become somewhat dated, in particular when it comes to the state of ornithological research. Interesting, however, for the bibliophile, is an annotated list of pre-1943 bird books, which comprises Appendix D. Overall, while I enjoyed reading this book and did derive some ideas and useful information, I would have to say that A Guide to Bird Watching is not an essential book on birding and would recommend looking for something more recent."
4,Love my undies!!!!!!,I was completely excessive and decided to purchase about 25 pairs of Necessary Objects underwear when I saw their sale and I couldn't be more pleased with each item. They are comfortable and really adorable which is a perfect combo. I know that I will be a repeat customer.
1,A disaster of a transfer,"The DVD release of this film had been delayed more times than i've had hot dinners, so i was with some some excitement that i finally layed my hands on a copy, esp. as i saw it was enhanced for widescreens TVs. OH DEAR. This is a disaster of a transfer, arguably the worst transfer of any anime disc ive yet seen (and thats a lot) On the plus side it does have a cool commentary track but surprisingly enough i don't buy a DVD to listen to, and this is like looking at the film through the bottom of a full beer glass, after having knocked back 10 pints already.This is what the net is all about, i waste my money so you don't have to. AVOID untill someone does justice to this film with a proper transfer."
1,Worse than a VHS,"This DVD is a scandal. One of the greatest anime ever made, and Manga gives us one of the poorest video transfer ever on DVD. The edge enhancement is visible to the point of being grotesque, the picture is unstable and not even soft but blurry. I'll spare you the details on the print defects, which are, to say the least, numerous. Even the LD was better.You'd be all well inspired to boycott this DVD and buy the Japanese edition instead. I'll think thrice from now before I buy any title from Manga."
2,"Oh, my...something is wrong","I am a relative newcomer to DVDs, but of the two dozen or so that I've seen (both animated and normal movies). This is the only DVD that has made me sit straight up and say out loud, ""Something is wrong."" The video transfer is terrible and it is very noticeable whenever anything moves. Maybe it has to do with the age of the film (the animation is about 15 years old), but the videotape version is superior in terms of quality picture. The sound is average and the extras are nice, but watching the film itself is unpleasant and it's hard to visually sift through the distortion."
2,Two years of delay for THIS ?,"Honneamise no Tsubasa is a superb show in itself. Sadly, you have to be aware that this DVD doesn't give it justice at all. The commentary track is a great addition, but the anamorphic transfert is *so bad* compared to the Japanese release (not to mention the lack of the new Japanese DD 5.1 track) that it's a shame from Manga to have made us waiting for two years and gratified us with such a poor video output. Boycott this until they put some new effort into it !"
2,cheap ?,"someone made the remark that the price was ,""cheap"" as in fairly priced ! at $78.00 for a new copy it`s more like being mugged in an ally and robbed at gun point !"
4,Worth the trip,"The Wings of Honneamise is a film that has truly a great animation, but the animation seems to well be darkened with the image of this poor DVD, The Wings of Honneamise has a truly good music, great and realistic animation, an excellent character development and probably the best ending i have seen on film, but the problem is that one Shiro tries to rape Riquinni well that scene feels like fingers in the eyes of the film, but it dosen't completely ruin it, but i think that the problem is that is a bit slow at the beginning and that it lacked of action, but i still loved it, but i would send an e-mail to Manga telling them that this film deserves better, the sound is very good, but curiously the 2.0 japanese soundtrack is better than the 5.1, for example the music sounds more natural, but the image (...), but it looks good on dark scenes, anyways i would recommend you seeing this film, it lacks a bit of action, but it still is like the Apollo 13 but in anime"
3,The movie was Fantastic!! The DVD not so great.,I was so excited to have finally purchased this movie. It should be in everyones Anime collection. The film does not disappoint! But the DVD is another matter. To my disappointment this DVD is riddled with encoding problems. The picture is fuzzy and toward the layer switch it breaks up (pixelization). I own about 250 DVDs many of them with dual layers and this is the only one that has this problem. I know this DVD may react differently to different players. But my Panasonic did not like this disc. This disc should be recalled and a new remastered reissue made.
2,hrm..,"I enjoy japanese animation, and was particularly impressed with both Akira and Ghost in the Shell, despite their somewhat disjointed plots. I can't honestly understand the enthusiasm for this film however... when is wasn't slow and tepid, it was preachy, and in the worst cheesy psuedo-mystical japanese marketroid sort of way.Stagnant plot, poor characterisation, but attractive stylistically."
4,"Anime version of ""The Right Stuff""","This anime is as different from a hentai anime (""Ninja Scroll"" - the greatest of Hentai anime BTW) as it may get. The movie may seem slow at first, but the intricate plot, well-drawn characters, underlying philosophy of science vs. religion, and virtuoso animation (Wow!) will move you emotionally and keep you visually spellbound to the last frame. Highly recommended."
3,This Movie is Over Rated,I was a little disappointed in this movie. The reviews raised my expectations. It was not as good as I expected. I kinded expected something as great as Akira.It's not a bad movie I just felt it lacked a certain air of seriousness. Though I do think it's worth the money.
5,Absolutely Great !,"Wings of Honeamise is an awesome movie. Video quality is of course important but seriously the visuals of the DVD aren't all that bad, you can still watch and enjoy this movie. The picture is kind of blurry and fuzzy if you choose to notice it, and the screen flickers at times... I'll just say this, this movie I would watch through a telescope at 3 miles with no audio what so ever, except the music. The world portrayed in the movie is so authentic... it's like a mixture of 40's and 60's war planes with a touch of the nineties ( yeah it's 2001 now but it still feels like the nineties :P ) I can't fully explain it so I'll just let you decide. If you are not as mad a fan as me don't buy this version if you have any doubts (wait for a re-release if there ever is one) but if you absolutely adore this movie, get it now, it is very watchable :)It could have been a better transfer to DVD but it's not as bad as said by previous reviewers."
5,A look at another time and place,"Being a fan of science fiction and more specifically post apocolyptic sci-fi, I came to see this movie as an incredible depiction of a different society where the viewer gets a chance to witness things being rediscovered such as the light bulb, and television in an alternate look at these amenities as they might have been. In this film, we see a society in what might compare to the 1950's of our era at the brink of space flight, with a brewing war drawn up by politicians which is riding on a single space flight. The film was dazzling effects wise and the artwork beautifully drawn. if you are new to anime then I highly recomend this movie as it's a wonderful first start, and if not, it's still worth renting at least."
5,A Landmark in Anime,"I've watched several great Anime movies, but when it comes to style, there's one movie that stands high above the rest. The Wings of Honneamise is certainly a landmark event in Japanese animation. The character animations are at their finest, more ""disciplined"" than Ninja Scroll, and that's what the animators really focused on. The story of a young man and his adventures in the Royal Space Force isn't the kind of plot you'd hear in other films like Akira and Ghost in the Shell, but The Wings of Honneamise still shines with or without a complex story. A true classic."
2,Just a tad slow for my taste.,"This film has received several awards ranging from animation to artistic value. While it does have excellent special effects, there is definitely something missing in the plot. The story line is contiguous, and there are a couple of parts in the movie that have some humor. The downfall of the movie, in my opinion, is that there is somewhat of a heavy religious undertone. I believe there was only one good action scene in the film in which an assassin chases the main character through the city. Other than that, the movie was, without a doubt, made for the Animae fans that enjoy more artistic movies than action movies. So, for those fans looking for an action movie or a film that they can stay attached to, don't stop here. There are some good parts, but you can also find a crust of bread in a trashcan, but I wouldn't advise looking in there."
1,"Classic Film, Ridiculously bad picture quality","I consider this film to be second only to Akira, in terms of Anime. It's a really wonderful story, and a very thoughtful one too. Unforunately, this has about the worst quality I have ever seen on a DVD. I have the VHS version of this, and it's much better. This one is so bad, that i'm surprised they haven't been recalled or a public apology has been given.Unfortunate.s/m"
1,Do not buy this DVD,This is the worst looking DVD I own. I read the DVD looks excellent on widescreen TVs but the video on my NORMAL TV looks worse than VHS taped in EP mode.I do not care how great the movie is the Video is too distracting.
4,Great movie if you can handle it,"An extreamly wonderfull film if you can handle it. The animation is beautifull and the story is phenominal. The only problem is how extremely powerfull the film gets at times. Some viewers may not be able to palate this film, simply becouse of how complicated the relationships between the charectors are and how complicated the plot line gets at times. Watch it when you can really pay atention. It's a must see for all true anime fans."
3,Fantastic Show...,"but the DVD just doesn't do it justice. Though the DVD is nice with special features, such as directors commentary (sub-titled of course), and the 4 minute preview movie that was used to get funding for it.The overall quality of the DVD is pretty bad, at least on my Xbox. It there are just too many flaws to ignore in the first 5 minutes, don't know if it has to do with the compression or what."
3,"Great film, horrible DVD transfer:","Very poor transfer of the film to DVD. The average viewer probably won't mind the problems, but audio and videophiles will recoil at the quality. It appears that the DVD was mastered from an old tape copy of the film that was in turn made from a relatively poor original film print. Hopefully a new release of the film will be made available. Having said all that, I still did buy the DVD."
2,"Greatest Anime ever, worst-quality DVD ever","The Anime is one of the best films ever, simply a masterpiece.But the picture quality of the DVD is so bad that even the VHS-version easily surpasses it.I remember watching the DVD some years ago and I thought ""What the h***??"".Today (Feb-04) I felt like checking if this was *really* so bad after all.And it is. It's even worse then I remembered it to be."
5,The subtle side of anime.,"I'm not exactly sure what initially possesed me to buy this movie, but I'm very glad I did. This is definitely not your typical anime. While many people expect gratuitous nudity and grotesque violence on an immence scale as the norm in anime, The Wings of Honneamise shatters those stereotypes with its focus on great storytelling and an environment that totally immerses the viewer for a truely great experience. The setting is a unique one as well, which tells the tale of a people trying to send a man into space with technology that is the equivalent of 1920-1930 America. Wings does a wonderful job of delving into the human mind, spirit, and faith; making it a good movie for people with these sorts of deep personal questions or anyone who just wants to examine the inner workings of a human being. This is a movie for anyone who enjoys an epic story, not just anime fans. I strongly suggest viewing this masterpiece, it is worth your time."
4,"A Reading of ""The Last One""","Length:: 4:27 MinsThis poem represents Merwin at his insidious best, the conversational tone of the poem slowly leading to something imminently and undefinably dark, doom-laden. The poem was originally published in ""The Lice"" a book of poems written in the French countryside where, Merwin says, ""I felt at once a profound attraction to the rural world in which I was living and a disquieting recognition of the fragility and uncertainty of my relation to it.""""The Last One"" ominously conveys that disquiet."
3,trimmer,It is not really sharp. I have to exchange it for the diff one.My friend told me this brand was the best but the one that I got not good
4,A exceptional Ep,"So good, ultra must have this is an example to other bands who has some songs and dont know what to do with them99 ways... that great voice of Dave and THAT solo a little one but as all good things LittlEA F U C K I N G MUST HAve CD"
3,"Not Megadeth's Best, But Still Good","Actually, I give this record 3 1/2 stars. It certainly does not represent Megadeth's finest efforts. But no matter how good any group is, not every single record they make can be a masterpiece. It is worth buying this record, even if only to hear 'No More Mr. Nice Guy,' 'Go to Hell,' and 'Paranoid.' I had not listened to Megadeth for a while, but when I bought this record recently, my interest in Megadeth was heavily reactivated. Sure, a lot of the songs are covers, but so what? Pick it up. You may be pleasantly surprised."
3,Not worth the money,"this album should probaly be skippped if not a hard fan of megadeth. It consists of cover songs and ones done for soundtracks. ""no more mr nicegy"" and ""paranoid"" are both very good but there is not that much else of value on the album."
4,"So Far, So Good, What Can I Say???","Having listened to this EP over and over and over (you get the idea) again, all I can say is this is pretty good listening. 'Goto Hell' has a good grinding beat with Mustaine bringing us closer to the edge od darkness before yanking us back with the embittered Angry Again. 'Paranoid', simply a classic..nothing else to be said about it. The rest of the album is pretty much the same, nothing exceptional and nothing easliy forgotten. To sumarise...sell your blood, sell your Dad's car but buy this album NOW!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome EP of soundtrack rarities,"Collecting seven tracks from various soundtracks and tribute albums, and a cover of the Sex Pistols' ""Problems"" recorded specifically for this disc, Megadeth's ""Hidden Treasures"" is an awesome EP that features some fantastic songs. Covers include a ripping cover of Alice Cooper's ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" (from the Shocker soundtrack) and the absolute best cover of Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"" (from the first Nativity in Black tribute album) you'll ever hear. Also here is ""Breakpoint"" (from the Super Mario Bros. movie), ""Go to Hell"" (from Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey), the amazing ""Diadems"" (from Tales From the Crypt Presents Demon Knight), and last but not least, a little song called ""Angry Again"" (from the Last Action Hero soundtrack) which is one of the best songs Dave Mustaine has ever written, and remains a concert favorite to this day. All in all, if you can find this EP and your a Megadeth fan, new or old, this is an absolute must own."
4,Covers are as covers do...,Yes these are covers minus one song but still they are good covers. I especially like Paraniod... Ozzy couldn't have played it harder himself. The only time I heard this come out as hard and fast was when Randy Rhodes was with him.This is a great CD for die hard fans and a good one for those not to familiar with the group's musical talents. The reason only 4 stars have been given is well. I like the group but original music goes alot farther that cover songs do.
2,Monochromatic,"I find that I've no choice but to disagree with the other reviews of Mr. Duggan's work. I found the manuscript rife with errors in the minor details of eleventh century military affairs. Admittedly the overall timeline of the First Crusade is rigidly adhered to and the personalities of the historic figures encountered follow accepted ideas, but the passages describing training, arming and fighting fail to impress on either an historical or dramatic level. I have rarely read a less colourful novel. The rich, varied and exciting land and city scapes of the era and area are glossed over with little or no description. It feels rather like reading an old print of a silent picture fading into obscurity. The main character is unredemptive in almost every way imaginable and equally as colourless as the setting. SPOILER: And he had ""walking corpse"" stamped on his forehead from the very first page. Overall an unrewarding and somewhat difficult read."
5,"Fun, Classic, adventure","I just played this game for the first time and it's great! A classic adventure with great humor and good challenging gameplay. Much better than the 3rd game in the series, ""Broken Sword: Sleeping Dragon."""
2,Extension Review,I wasn't too impressed with this one. I seemed hard to hold a curl and it just seemed messy. I would not order this product again but that's just me.
1,Don't waste your money!!,Awful product!! The clips are on backwards making it nearly impossible to clip on and stay on. The hair is very thin and staticy...BIG waste of money. I went on the website to complain and it was taken down.
4,Amazon sent me the wrong color,I ordered pink and Amazon mistakenly sent me the blonde. I didn't have time to send back and order again so I just kept it. The quality of the product however is pretty good.
3,For the price it worked.,"The hair was a pretty good quality and easy to make straight or curly, however the clip was difficult to cover up."
4,Stays in and looks great,"Ignore the person who said they couldn't get these to stay in. They're very simple! The clip simply pops open and closed with a small push. I just move a thin section of hair near the top of my head back (you want a section to cover the clip), slide the clip on starting about an inch or two below my root, slide it as far up as I can, then pop the clip shut. The clip stays in wonderfully! It lies very flat so it is impossible to detect. The hair can be curled or straightened and it looks 100% real, as if I had a streak of real hair dye in! I'll be ordering many more of these! The best part is that they're also long enough that you can trim them to meet your hairs length! I only gave it four stars because it gets a little thin as you get to the bottom, but if you're trimming it or placing two side by side, no one would know. Great product, love it, will be buying more!"
4,4 stars,Was a great figure and very happy with it. Unfortionetly there was dents in box so not 100% great condition but nothing to complain to much about.
4,The powder works great.,"I spread peanut butter on a greenie, then put the Bitch pills powder on the peanut butter. Works like a charm with my tiny Prague Ratters and they have had beautiful litters of puppies."
1,Bought for my wife,"I bought these for my wife hoping they would change her. Unfortunately she's still the same old bitch I married. Didn't work, I don't suggest buying them."
1,MY DOG HATES THESE!,"My pregnant shih tzu won't touch these. I have tried smashing them up in her food and she wont't eat her food...need to do SOMETHING with the formula, they are too big to shove down her throat!"
5,This book is a real treat for young readers!,"This is a wonderful, imaginative book about the free-spirited Pippi Longstocking and her adventures. I'd actually recommend it for younger children, too (I was only 6 when I read it the first time, and it became my favorite book)."
5,Fun to Read,"This is a fun and silly novel about a girl with mind-boggling strength, intense zest for life, spontaneity, and no desire for practicality. It is light-hearted and fun to read."
5,Intelligent and fascinating,"Soul Echoes is a concise, no-nonsense approach to the understanding and use of past-life therapy. Dr. Freedman not only includes fascinating excerpts from her clients' forays into their past lives, but draws on the tenets and theory of both religion and psychology to form a clear, thoughtful picture of reincarnation. The result is a book that is as interesting as it is helpful; a fascinating journey into the wholeness and healing of the human race."
1,Don't waste your time on this boring and poorly written book,"It's difficult to say what the worst feature of this book is. But it's probably the uninspired dialogue. Or it might be the superficial and banal characters. Actually, pretty much everything in this novels sucks. Don't bother with it. I would give it zero stars if that was an option."
2,"Please try again, Mr. Leonard.","Just because this novel is mediocre shouldn't discourage Elmore Leonard from settings such as Cuba in 1898. I'm a big fan of his tried and true stuff, yet I was chomping at the bit to read this new breed of Leonard. At times the novel is great, but I agree with another reviewer who wondered if Leonard had to meet a deadline: the tail end of the book is just awful. This Leonard work is best ignored. However, I hope ol' Elmore will try similar ideas in works to come."
4,Good Service,"item arrived quickly and as advertised - come on, it's just a p/b book purchase...I knew what I wanted, ordered it and it came promptly and it's condition was as advertised...a fair transaction all around."
5,"Elmore Leonard experiments, with great success",This is a totally different Elmore Leonard. Yes there are goodies and baddies but this is not a crime story. It is set in a revolution we hardly new happened and it is a totally absorbing story. I love it to little bits. Gareth Powell
4,It's no GLITZ but a great read,"Elmore has done it again. This book mixes action,romance,drama, and even a little history together for a wild ride that will have you turning the pages until the grand finale.Once again, Elmore delivers a nonstop thrill ride. Cowboys,smart- beutiful women, and the most ruthless bad guys are all blended together for a book full of surprises. It is not his best work (GLITZ is still my tops) but any Leonard fan will not be disappointed"
2,not up to leonard's better stuff,"Fans of GLITZ and GET SHORTY will be sorely disappointed by Leonard's latest. A period piece, it is plodding and cumbersome, without the page-turning knack he's known for. Let's hope he learns a lesson from this debacle."
2,If you have not read Leonard before this should not be ...,the on you start with. If you have you'll be disappointed. I read the first two hundred pages on a flight to Las Vegas and didn't bother with the other half on the way back. This just does not sweep you up like his other books. The dialogue limps and you could care less about any of the characters. All a bit cliched - the story way too 'Boy's Own'.But give him credit for not settling into what is comfortable.
3,This one really misses the boat,"After reading my first Elmore Leonard book I went in search of everything else he had ever written and have eagerly awaited each new book. Not all of them have satisfied, but enough succeed brilliantly to keep me waiting. Now this. It not only doesn't satisfy, it misses the boat totally. This is something of a departure for Leonard, a historical fiction that melds aspects of his western and crime fiction into a story set against actual historical events. Unfortunately, he doesn't give us enough of either the history - which should be really interesting - or his fiction - which in this case seems flat and unsatisfying. The plot wanders and the conclusion is not solid and doesn't please in the way that his books frequently do.In sum, this book is lacking in both the humor and the bite that make his best work a joy to read. I was really let down."
2,Why?,"Leonard has taken a fascinating topic and era, and turned out a clunker. This once-entertaining storyteller is below average in this effort."
1,This isn't Cuba,"Elmore Leonard doesn't know anything of cuban history. Cubans weren't bandits. Cubans didn't drink whiskey, rum was the common drink with alcohol. The name Lourdes wasn't common at all in the XIX century. And I doubt that a Guardia Civil could spoke a word englih."
1,Elmore Leonard fans beware!,"What has happened to Elmore Leonard? What is he trying to prove with this book? Non of the classic Leonard is here...no rich character developement, no rich story line, no irreverent humor. This book is just boring, period. Please Elmore, Please, Please, Please do what you do best...and not this."
2,A Disappointment,I felt that there were too many plot threads that received scant attention. Just the story of the Maine and the war would have been enough. Tyler's story of being a cowboy would have been enough. We had to go through yet another dreary telling of all the cold blooded killing and torture that occured to boot. That stuff gets real old.
2,A disapointment!,"Elmore Leonard must have been to busy writing screenplays to write this novel - he must have hired a ghost writer. Not up to Leonard's standards established over years of writing terrific thrillers.The characters rate a 1. The plot rates a 1. And the prose rates a 1. That's how I came up with an overall 3.If he decides to write a sequel to this one, I'll pass!"
1,This book was disgustingly bad,"I picked this up in a used bookstore (thank god i didnt pay full price) and planned to read it on vacation. After 100 pages, I threw it in the garbage. This dialouge is unrealistic; the characters talk like illiterate third graders. Worse than that it the bland character structure. It was just an annoying piece of dribble. Although i liked the movie get shorty and Jackie brown, I won't subject myself to his writing again.Leonard could do less damage if he was drunk behind the wheel of an automobile instead of behind a typewriter."
2,This is not up to Leonard's other books,"In Cuba Libre, Leonard tries too hard to fill his canvas with a host of characters. Most of them have no depth and confuse the reader by disrupting the flow of the narrative, and the story line suffers."
2,Less than Meets The Eye,"It's sad to have a favorite author just go through the motions. Unconvincing dialog, unbelievable emotional content, generally boring. Fulfilling a book commitment to the publisher maybe?"
3,"Entertaining, But Heard That Song Before","CUBA LIBRE was my first foray of reading Mr. Elmore Leonard. I had been reading the classics, and gave them a rest and picked up this best-seller. It's light reading, an entertaining story, but I feel I heard that old song before. He borrows very heavily from Hemingway's FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. Leonard's Ben Tyler, the cowboy, is so close to Hemingway's Robert Jordan, you have to laugh. The same with Ben Tyler's girlfriend, Amelia. She is the double of Robert Jordan's Maria. Did Leonard think that he could escape these comparisons, that no one reads Hemingway any more? Having said that, I was entertained. But don't confuse this novel with originality. - Kevin Farrell"
1,All Leonard's faults are revealed,"in this weak pastiche of the author's familiar tricks. We've seen most of it done better in his other books. Though the setting -- Cuba during the Spanish-American War -- is promising, the book is just a potboiler with cookie-cutter characters and a lame plot. There really is no payoff, just a dragging of baggage to a conclusion. Unsatisfying and dull.Pass on this one whether you're an Elmore fan or not.EKW"
1,Thoroughly predictable!!,"This was my first Leonard novel, and it will probably be my last. The whole book read like a bad movie. More emphasis was placed on the characters physical appearance than on development of the story. It was as if he was picturing the actor who was to play the character on screen. I predict this is made into a TV movie within the next couple of years and will be just as bad as ""The Last Don."""
1,This guy is a vastly over-rated writer,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't get through to the utter end of this book. I sloughed through about 80% of it ... getting less & less interested in their lives, adventures & especially in their loves. All you have to do is compare the narrative style of old-timer ""adventure"" writers like Hemingway, Conrad and yes, even Fitzgerald, to see that Leonard is second rate. His ""love scenes"" are especially pathetic -- with the cardboard cut-out characters touching their lips without generating any reader response at all. Read ""Empire by Default"" instead if you want an exciting yarn (true) about the Spanish American War. And read Hemingway, Remarque or Crane if you want a terrific & compelling war novel."
2,"With a book like this, who needs Nytol?","This is a book that not even a triple shot espresso could save. Well written but so utterly uninteresting that it redefines boredom. The only thing original about the story is its setting (Havana before and during the Spanish American War). This is the kind of book that the big publishing houses put out relying on the author's name recognition to sell copies. It's a lot like The Phantom Menace in that no one had the guts to tell George Lucas the script was horrible and look what happened there (I'm going for the record with not helpful votes with that comment). It's not that the book is terrible, it's just nothing, not good, not bad, just a bunch of paper with ink on it, sadly the kind of thing publishers are willing to take a chance on these days in their collective pursuit of maximum sales regardless of literary merit (or lack thereof). Having read Get Shorty and a couple of other good Leonard novels, I was sadly disappointed by Cuba Libre."
1,Confusing and Unnecessary,I've been a PC user for years. Switching to the Mac should have been a no brainer. The Mac has lots of app's that are easy and fun. Also self evident. But I did have a problem sending mail with my Mac account (still unresolved). This book does not discuss issues with sending mail. Most of the other chapter material is unnecessary. The organization is poor and arcane topics are discussed at great length. I learned more from my 70 page manual that came with the Mac.
2,100% of the worlds software?,I wasn't aware that the the thousands of software applications written almost exclusively for Linux would run on a mac.
3,Not exactly What I Expected,"I haven't read the entire manual. Due to some cerebral related problems, I have a very short attention span, and short term memory loss. So I was really hoping for some sort of clear cut index comparing Microsoft OS to Tiger OS. There was an index, but it wasn't wired that way. Other then that, It seems to be a comprehensive publication. Since the problem really sits with me, I guess I should have given it a better score."
5,Just what the Dr. ordered,"Just what the Dr. ordered!!Most everyone I know is making the switch from PC to Mac and that's what this book is all about.We don't need to know the Mac from a Mac user's point of view, but from a PC users's point of view.If that's you then this book is for you"
4,Well worth the cost,"Excellent resource for anyone who is switching from a PC to Mac. Easy to understand chapters, great content, helpful hints. I had no idea how powerful Macs were in comparison to PC's."
4,Better to have new Mac in hand,"Good book. No matter how you handle this 400+ pages on how to run an OS is boring. While info is good, best to have the computer in hand so you can refer to the real thing. I am too broke to buy the Mac Pro that I want so will wait untill after X mas to treat myself and then reopen the book!"
2,was really hoping for something else...,"The book is FULL of apple button commands. They are like short cuts. Only thing is, that its like teaching DOS to a guy that only knows Windows. Who can possibly remember even a quarter of these commands. The one important thing I gleaned from this book was the software they recommended for changing your files from your outlook mail box to apple mail. Coming to think about it, I pulled that off the apple site O2M by Little Machines, 10 bucks grabs the files you need to transfer. Or just take it to the apple store and have a genius do it for free. I did learn how to alt-tab, its apple button tab. there, I just saved you a few bucks."
2,McAfee Total Protection 2007 worked 1 out of 3,The software was installed on three computers and slowed two down so much I had to remove it on 2 and have not put it back on it worked fine on one of the three
2,Won't co-exist with other programs,"Until '07, if you had a McAfee suite but only wanted to use some of its components, and use other programs for other aspects of protection, that worked fine. For instance, I use Zone Alarm Pro for firewall and Spyware Doctor for spyware, and McAfee '06 just for virus. This combination has worked fine, but McAfee '07 won't install *any* of itself unless all other programs are removed. And that's a no-go for me, since some components of McAfee (esp spyware) weren't rated all that well by reviewers."
1,Don't Buy this Product,"While I had McAfee (41 days, total), it slowed Internet speed to a crawl. But that's not the worst of it. I had this product for about three weeks before it killed Internet accessibility completely. It took another week to receive system restore disks that I had to order from my PC supplier. Then I called to cancel my subscription. The customer service rep at McAfee repeatedly told me that because I'd kept the contract for more than 30 days, I couldn't receive a refund. We bandied about for over 10 minutes, the rep declaring that neither could he, nor could anyone help me receive a refund - nothing could be done. Then I discovered the password of, ""I'd like to speak to your supervisor."" The immediate response was, ""please hold, while I transfer you to my supervisor."" I did get my refund, but be wary of this product, and its customer service."
2,Not the best choice,"I bought this webcam to use it with Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon 32 bit.The system recognizes it - so does skype. But I'm not happy with the image quality, and I couldn't find a way to adjust the picture preferences. So I can't use it in poorly lighted places at all, that stays for a normal room light. Best picture is at daylight."
2,Playable... barely,"This game is terrible on the eyes. You can't see anything. You can't see the fighting and sometimes can't even tell what direction you're pointed in. The graphics are so poor you can't even tell what items are what. There are text graphic descriptions but they're blurry and the font is very small. This pie menu they have come up with for inventory is horrendous. Special skills are listed in this ""pie menu"" so it makes it difficult to use them in combat.44.99? Waste of money. Rent first."
2,"Slow moving, and eye straining","Too small... you can't see what is really happening as you attack your enemies. I wasn't expecting Mortal Kombat style fighting or anything.. but as other reviews have said characters are just tiny on the screen.The story seems to have inspired a few people. I thought it left a lot to be desired. I didn't bother with more than the first few levels. I'm very glad I rented this game first. With the variety of games out there, I'm sure you can do better."
2,nya,okay so looked at the other reviews on other sites and stuff and they all said the graffics were awesome and the game was basically to die for. i admit that the reviews were made like 5 years ago but when i got the game all the other dreamcast games i have been playing have way better graffics the idea for this game is good but i found hardcore glitches within the first 5 minutes. made me really not like this game i walked off the screen and then i couldnt get back on the screen. i am very disapointed with this game.
1,"This game should be smashed, melted, and urinated on","Do your self a favor and avoid this ""game"" at all costs. The graphics are terrible, the fighting is boring and the idiotic camera will drive you INSANE. I only played this game for about 10 minutes, but that was enough to see how terrible it was. It's a steaming pile of fecal matter so don't contaminate your Dreamcast by putting this filth in it!"
4,cool game,"I did not buy ""SILVER"" from ... but i got it from ... this game is pretty cool the graphics are allright but ... for this?? its a good game but not for that price! i got my copy for ... so buy the game because its cool but just not from here"
4,"""Silver""","Play as David, a head-strong, sometimes over-confident knight on a mission to reclaim the wife who was taken from him. Wander through the amazingly rendered world of ""Jarrah"". Throughout the game you are free to roam the land without the constraint of having to complete one mission to move on to the next. There is no given sequence that you have to follow which makes the game more realistic than most RPG's. There is a wide array of weaponry, all with upgrades. Many different types of magic to wield, which only get stronger with frequent use.The downside to this game would have to be the distance at which you view the action. Being so far away can make battle difficult, especially when trying to take on many creatures at once. The battle controls seem rather awkward at first but become more comfortable in time. All in all this is a really great game, a must buy for an avid action/RPG fan."
1,"They should have called it ""Stainless Steel"".","Silver just doesn't cut it in my opinion. The story line is weak, predictable, and fragmented. The graphics aren't bad, but by no means are they ground breaking. There are also instances where you need binoculars to see the characters because they get so small. I also felt that the play control could have been better arranged. While the game does not fail completely, it does come close. There are just better games to buy with your money, in my opinion."
4,Close to restaurant as you get,"Only 4 stars because chow mein noodles in a cello bag will never match getting them from a restaurant. These are the next best thing, however. And these are the better wider noodles with good flavor, not the thin hard La Choy type that you usually find in supermarkets."
2,tasteless!,this is a pretty bland product. they taste like cardboard...any resemblance to the real thing is purely coincidental!the manufacturer should go back to the drawing board on this one!
1,"this book is just the paperback versoin of ""Everything you've heard about investing is wrong!""","this book is just the paperback versoin of ""Everything you've heard about investing is wrong!"" by the same author published by Random House. I found out only after purchasing it. Really hate the new publisher John Wiley & Sons Inc! Why did they change the title of the same book just to sell more copies? Couldn't they indicate this explicitly to the potential buyers?"
2,Disappointed,"I waited anxiously to receive this book and I have to say regretably that I am totally disappointed. There is some useful information in it but it was written, IMO, as a theory as to what was going to happen in the final few years of the 20th century and Mr. Gross got it wrong. We saw the biggest rise and fall in the history of the market, not the 6 percent that Mr. Gross predicted. Rather than focusing so narrowly on what he believed was going to happen in a specific time period I was hoping for a general book and am disappointed because this book is dated."
5,"Fun Read, Good Advice",I found the investment advice in this book to be very fresh and helpful. Bill Gross clearly understands what drives the markets and he is able to explain his theories in a very clear and logical manner. Get this book if you want to understand more about the impact of macroeconomic fundamentals on the world of investing today.
3,"Beware one book two titles ""Bill Gross on investing"" and ""Everything you have heard about investing is wrong""","Beware one book two titles ""Bill Gross on investing"" and ""Everything you have heard about investing is wrong"".Otherwise is has a lot of wisdom. The problem is that it's too short and it is not explained why he believes many things."
5,Evocative and surreal,"Tatsuyuki Tanaka's experience truly shines through in this hardcover with the content of the 143 pages ranging from full color illustrations and storboards to sketches and movie stills.Mixing gritty sci-fi and fantasy settings with many dark and bizarre elements using a precise penmanship he creates a book where every drawing pulls you in.The book is in Japanese, but this shouldn't deter buyers as there is not a single page of text aside from the afterword. Tanaka is letting the images speak for themselves.If you're not a fan of anime or manga, don't be scared of this book. It stands by itself as a good example of Japanese illustration that, while having clear roots, goes beyond the cliches of most others.Highly recommended for any lover of comic and movie illustration."
2,Just a brief overlook,"This book gives you just a brief overlook in the complex situation on the Balkan in the years 1941-1944. Sides participating in this conflict are just basically mentioned lacking more detailed description, especially of the various auxiliaries forces (chetniks are represented us unifying movement, for example, although there was several fraction inside this movement, some of the parties involved are not mentioned at all). Operation that Germans conducted against guerillas are just briefly mentioned without any detailed explanations, on the tactical levels non what so ever. I was hoping to find something more about Jagdkommando units, but even though author did inform us of the existence of such units, there is nothing about organizations or operations that such units conducted. So it may be a good book if you just begin to research the subject, but if you want to form a full picture you will need further reading."
4,Low Budget but pretty good,The movie was actually shot in Brazil. I think this is a straight-to-video release. Looks like it was shot on a shoestring budget but the scenery looks great. The movie really picks up when the unbelievably gorgeous Rae Dawn Chong appears. She doesn't appear until 50 minutes into the movie. If you are a fan of Rae's you will love this movie. She has a deep dark skin tan in this movie.
4,Beautiful Scenery,"While the story was a little slow it was nice to see the wonders of the Amazon rain forest and to be reminded of what it holds for our future. Low budget, but worth every penny."
3,SLR sensor cleaning,"USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.I prefer not to use the swabs it came with, as it is rough and can easily harm the sensor as it did to my canon rebel xti.I use the liquid by itself with a lens cleaning cloth to clean my sensor.And the liquid, it leaves a light greasy residue behind, not really recommended."
2,disappointed,i saw this years ago through musicchoice on directtv they cut alot of stuff out on this dvd i wanted to see Lalaine perform i'm not your girl and its not on here.
1,Sucks,"Talented artists were poorly portrayed in this DVD. I bought it because I like a couple of the artists, Vanessa Hudgens and Aly and AJ to be precise. There were no chapters to the DVD, so after wading through and not finding anything I liked I plan to sell it to some other poor sucker."
4,Corruption investigations during Viet Nam,Fantastic book covering a key corruption investigation in the Army during Viet Nam. It is worth reading.
4,Very good book,As always Robin Moore and his co-authors bring out a good military story. I knew the real events behind this and Moore brought them all to life. Worth reading if you want a look into military life in the late 60's and early 70's
4,Still sounds like Teddy Pendergrass,Mr. Rice is smooth with a strong voice of love with each word and it's obvisous he is singing from his heart. The CD was made in the early ninties but it sounds good for today. I wasn't disappointed.
3,It has some catchie songs.,"Yes if you like to retrospect the romantic r&b songs of the ninety's then this CD is for you I wanted the smash hit video song of Gene Rice's "" Victim"" but it was not on this CD."
3,Could have been better.,"Gene Rice's 1991-released debut CD ""Just For You"" was a near-perfect set of smooth Quiet Storm ballads with Rice's ultra-soulful, Teddy Pendergrass-influenced vocals making it a superb album for its time. Unfortunately, this follow-up effort tends to concentrate on uptempo New Jack Swing tracks and is much less satisfying. The ballads ""I Can't Wait"", ""Don't Walk Away"" and a better-than-average cover version of Barry White's classic ""I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little Bit More Babe"" make this CD worthwhile, however."
1,Don't buy this product--It doesn't work!,"When I was shopping for car adapters and chargers, I figured, ""Eh, they're all the same, right? Why pay $15 more?"" Well, I was definitely wrong. Quite simply, this product doesn't work. I have a 3rd generation iPod and it won't charge it. In fact, it causes the iPod to freeze up and the image on the screen gets funky.I wasted my money. Please don't waste yours. BTW, I have previously owned the Belkin and it was good. My only complaint is that the wires frayed after 2 years."
3,its ok but not the best out there,"the car charger works great, just the tape adapter, they sent me some cheap brand that doesnt perform the job good. i thought i was getting an apple brand tape adater but i guess not."
1,Poor stuff,"The quality is very poor..cheap quality plastic is used.Made a loud whirling sound when inserted in the tape.The sound was louder than the music being played.On top of this, it stopped working in 2 weeks of minimal usage.Money gone waste...really poor"
2,Photo not correct: no coil cord,"The main reason I chose this model over the many others, was the coil cord on the adapter, as shown in the photo. When the product arrived it didn't have a coil cord. sigh. And there was no packaging also. Seems like this is misrepresentation."
2,Cheap in all senses,"Unfortunately, this wire is the flimsiest ""18ga"" wire I have ever seen, and the insulation material is not of very good quality. If you want a quality product, I am afraid you should look elsewhere and expect to pay more.Additionally, the spools are flimsy and several of the rolls arrived with broken spools, which makes unspooling a bit of a challenge."
4,8051 review,"this book help us to understanding how use c_51 programing tool to make more efficient program that run on 8051 intel microcontrollers,and how use input and output peripherals of this cpu with c_51 programing and how design well algorithm and..."

5,This is wonderful!,"Gene Harris is a true master of his craft. This quartet makes beautiful music; this group is one of which I want all their recordings (and I'm in process of getting it). The mood of the music is very uplifting! The audio signal is clear, as are all Concord Records I've bought. This quartet consists of Gene Harris on piano (and band leader), Ron Eschete on guitar, Jeff Hamilton on drums, and the late GREAT Ray Brown on bass! All ten tracks are beautiful, beautiful."
1,"Great Book, poor performance","Vanished Arizona is a wonderful book. Read it! Unfortunately the audio book verison does not do it justice. Both the abrigement and the narrator's performance serve to make Martha ""Mattie"" Summerhayes sound like an idiot. As a descendant of hers I take that very personally. In fact my whole family, including my sister Katharine Summerhayes Beale, named after Martha's daughter, listened to the book together and we had to turn it off we were so horrified with the production. I urge you to read the compelling book, but don't waste your time or money on the audio version."
5,"Sasha breaks out of the tired ""house""","Fundacion is an outstanding mix in itself, but considering the steps Sasha takes towards European-style Electro dance music on this CD it must be considered groundbreaking.Sasha is not only redefining how DJs create their mixes with his new MAVEN system, but he's pushing the envelope the overall sound of this mix. If you like the same old house music we've been dancing to for the last decade, this CD will be too dark and mechanical for you. ""Ibiza"" was recorded almost 10 years ago, and it's past time for new danceable sounds. Take a chance, and give it a few listens, and you may agree."
3,not his best,A lot of the songs on this album sound too cluttered. There are a handful of good tracks but most of them arent that interesting. I still think airdrawndagger and northern exposure eastcoast edition are his best works. I dont really think this cd was worth buying.
4,Worth trying out,"This is not vintage Sasha. Having said that, this CD still manages to capture Sasha's magic. It needs a couple of listens to appreciate the depth of the samples and the ""virtual"" mixing that he has served up. Get the CD if you are willing to try something new and are not put off by a bad first listen."
1,The tracks are dull... all of them,"was extremely excited for this to come out following involver, which i still can't get enough of. this CD is dull from front to back. total rubbish. all of it. especially the cheesy intro w/ the robot gal talking about sasha's athleticism and competitive spirit. please. I've been really digging nick warren shanghai and james holden 'at the controls'"
4,Great Album But...,"I'm a huge fan and to me Sasha can do no wrong. He always seems to keep ahead of the trends... giving the fans what they want even before they know they want it. Overall though I'd say it is an outstanding album that is only rivaled by Sasha's previous work.There is one thing about the album that has been gnawing at me for weeks though. The tracks are split up in a really awkward way. The best example of this are tracks 2, 3 and 4. They should be combined to form 1 track. Am I the only person that's discovered this?"
3,This Album May Grow On You,"At first I thought I hated this album. But since I bought it, I had to try and keep listening to it. So I did and now I like it. It's not the best ever Sasha. I can't give it a very good 4 stars. But it is at least good - perhaps very good. My apologies to the Global Underground leadership for calling this album ""Crap"" first time around. I must have been in a bad mood. This is a very strange mix in that over time of repeated listening, it sounds much better. And now on to Nick Warren and Shanghai GU 28. Just in time for prime time Summer '05."
1,ZRODN,The cd cover is cool and the statements inside are worthy of praise however the sound the music the mix is totally different from what i usually hear from this artist. more like a slow elevator house techno jazzy theme i mean lets start a new genre dont get me wrong it might sell to a different crowd mostly those in europe go for slow off-tone off beat off sync musical sounds like green acres but ten steps up with slow bpm's or maybe barbra streisand fans or 60's or 70's christian rock or a whole new musical database of fans that i dont know exist but i mean throw the maven away or use it for its glory and if those workers around you who hepled you make this cd dont give you loot i would fire them and tell them what they can do with this new musical format i mean its that bad but not.
3,2005 - The Search For a New Sound Continues,"If you haven't already noticed a trend from your own electronica collection, the year 2005 had many infamous DJ's (especially in the UK) exploring new and innovative methods for creating, mixing, and recording electronica. Renaissance Presents: Utilities showcases Sasha's protege, James Zabiela's effort. Fundacion NYC is Sasha's. The master of melodies and harmonics.After the super-cheesy intro track, ""Rise Of The Machine"" by Badger, Fundacion NYC shows a lot of promise. Tracks 2 to 6 establish a nice groove which is distinctly Sasha's. Unfortunately, the album does a 180 degree turn after this, and the last 12 tracks are bland and overly techy. They may showcase what MAVEN can do, but at the cost of keeping Fundacion NYC interesting.3.5/5 stars."
1,Worst Global Underground EVER,Were the publishers on vacation or just out to lunch. I rely on Global Underground to not release CRAP and this is nothing short of CRAP. I have bought every Global Underground CD and DVD they sell and this is by far NOT of the calibur I am used to receiving. Extremely disappointed - especially coming from Sasha who's Involver is one of the all time greatest mixes I have ever heard. What happened? I think we need a public apology from the presidents of Global Underground. PLEASE do NOT buy this album so they get the message. I feel totally burned this time for the first time.
4,Song of Songs,Enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed the authors first book Roses Have Thorns..Enjoy the period and the story being told.
2,Makes Lethal Weapon 4 look like a great sequel,"I heard they might make a part 4, what''s it gonna be called ? ""Return to Wolly World"" ? lol. This is a very mildly entertaining 3rd sequel that brings Foley to a fun park called Wolly World to face some new villains. The results is an often very [bad] film with a script that should of stayed in the garbage. If you have any interest at all in it just rent it don't buy it. Buy the first 2, this one is so bad it pretty near ruined Murphy's career."
3,Good laughs Landis style,Well this third and last by the moment Beverly Hills Cop movie is not like the 2 firsts with great action and chases and thrills instead we have some gags and the John Landis style with great directors cameos(George Lucas) and his trademark humour and hits.In the Dvd extras content I must say that this is the most flop of the 3 that's why I give only 3 stars of 5.Paramount Studios should give some extras more to have the level that had the 2 others.
2,Movie isn't great - but the park shots are now classics.,"Well, in my opinion this movie is the reason the Beverly Hills Cop series stopped at three (rather than even thinking of going further). The movie itself is pretty poor, especially if you are expecting to see another Eddie Murphy film where you're just on-the-floor from laughing so hard -- this movie really missed that mark, I think.The only reason I own this movie, quite honestly, is because I live within a few miles of the amusement park that it was filmed in and I remember being there when they were working up the sets (Paramont's Great America (or PGA) in Santa Clara, CA)."
1,Beverly Hills Cop III,"The first two films of this trilogy are great. If you have never seen them, I recommend that you go to your local rental store and rent them. As for this one, it's horrible. This is the worst one to me. I hated the theme park story, or was it just the theme park music that was annoying? Anyway, avoid it."
2,Beverly Hills Cop III,"Beverly Hills Cop III~ Eddie Murphy is not a terrible movie. Then again if you compare this sequel to the two first movies then one must say that it is a disappointment. Eddie Murphy is not nearly as funny as in the first two movies and the script is half lame as if they had run out of ideas. The plot is paper thin, and a total hoot compared to the two previous movies. Man, I was really looking forward to watching this movie after having seen the two other movies. This is a mediocre movie at best and gets the 2 stars that it deserves. Not recommended."
1,Should have stopped at two,"This movie was just horrible. It takes place in an amusement park for one. The action was weak, the story line was weak, and the ending was just silly. Watch this film at your own risk!!!!!"
2,"The worst in a once promosing series,","Beverly Hills Cop III is the worst in what was a promosing action comedy franchise. Murphy was in a carrer slump and I guess he made this film to help out his carrer but it didn't help just sunk it deeper. The film is full of mistakes such as the loss of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer a weak script and a lack of action. John Landos who worked with Murphy before and made good films fails here. The film needed a good action director like Renny Harlin,Dwight H. Little or even Karthyn Bigelow who were all at the top of their game back in 94. Skip this one even if you're a die hard Murphy fan."
1,3's a bomb,"My family (ages 77, 70, 50, 18, 16, 14, and 44) really enjoyed the first 2 Beverly Hills movies, however the third one only got thumbs up from grandma. It lacked the freshness of the first 2, and was instead a typical cliched sequel. Boring."
4,Classic Eddie Murphy,"This movie is not as good as the first three movies, probably because it follows a bit of the same formula from the first two. Even so, it is a good movie. Rosewood and Serge rejoin Foley as all crimes in Detroit seem to lead to Southern California. Detective Taggert is replaced, which is a shame since his replacement does not seem to have the same chemistry the three main characters had in the first movie. Even so, it is definitely worth owning if you enjoyed the first two in the series."
1,This movie confirms that the part 3s and 4s always suck!,"Part 1 and part 2 were great. Whenever a 3rd part comes out or even a 4th and so on I am always skeptical because they usually suck. This movie was no different. Weak plot, boring as heck and the actors are wastedbecause they werent even given good lines. I own a huge collection od DVDs and I own part1 and part 2 and I wouldnt add part 3 if someonegave it to me for free!"
4,Axel Goes to Disney World!!!,"I didn't think it was that bad! I love that it takes place at an amusement park! When his boss, Inspector Todd is killed, Axel goes back to Beverly Hills to find the killer that works at Wonderworld. It mostly has action and suspense than it does comedy. I highly recommend BEVERLY HILLS COP III!!!"
5,Great replacement especially for the price.,Only costed a fourth (paid around $60) of what the dealer was charging. Windows go up and down what could be better.
3,Intriguing debut by Abramo...Diamond may be a gem..,"J.L Abramo's first mystery ""Catching water in a net"" has some rough edges, but I throughly enjoyed it. Between the humorous characters, Diamond's love for George Dickey scotch, and an interesting plot involving the murder of Jake Diamond's(the protagonist) mentor and subsequent murders that tie into a large debt and a mobster that doesn't want to be found, this novel does make it to my recommendations list. The writing does need some work, but I believe Abramo will write other great mysteries."
5,YAY!!!,"I absolutely LOVE Everwood... It is my favorite show on television. Being in high school it is a show that i can really relate to. I always watch it with my mom and sister, it is a really good show to watch with family members, especially pre-teens and teens. WB Monday's at 9 eastern... watch it! :-)"
3,Special Features not as stated on box,"I love the Everwood series however I was very disappointed in the DVD Complete First Season. It states on the box that there are numerous special features including unaired scenes, behind the scenes fun, the making of a featurette, extended version of the pilot, and commentaries on 4 episodes. In reality, there are absolutely no special features on the discs except the commentaries on 4 edisodes. I consider this a rip-off because the special features are not included. Therefore, I give the series 5 stars but the misleading statements on the box deserve 0 stars."
5,LOVE IT!,"I absolutely loved this show when it was still on air, but was unable to get the chance to watch it most weeks. THis box set was definitely not a disappointment. I cannot wait to buy the second season!"
5,I have never enjoyed a show more!,Everwood is the BEST show! I cried when it got canceled! I am dying to have seasons 2 through 4. I bought the 1st season and gave the videos to all of my friends and family to watch and now they are in love with the show. If you have not seen it you are in for such a treat! (And I don't just mean Treat Williams!)
5,What's there to say,"Ever since i've moved to a new town and the cable company idiotically does NOT have the WB, i have been suffering through withdrawal from everwood and all the other wb shows. I was addicted to this show from the first episode the first season, all the actors play their parts perfectly and watching Dr. Brown trying to learn how to be a father is amusing yet touching. I miss this show, and i'm so glad that finally they are putting them out of DVD,although i have seen the entire first season, it means the next seasons will be following shortly :-)"
4,Everwood Season One,"It was great to be able to watch all the episodes of season one all over again, it's been a long time since I was able to watch them all. The extras are also very interesting, including the ""Greg and Emily Cam"" which showed that the cast/crew got along well off the set as well. The packaging is very nice, and it's great to have all the episodes from the first season in a nice collection. Here's hoping to more DVD sets from this series!"
5,Everwood First Season is Fantastic,"Everwood first season is absolutely fantastic. Where are seasons 2, 3 and 4 on DVD? Also, bring Everwood back for season 5!"
5,Great 1st Season,This has been a great show to watch with our family (teenage kids). We would love to be able to watch and own every Everwood episode on DVD!
5,For All Time,"There are some things in life that I know when I see them, I just have to have for all time. I want them around for the rest of my life... and now that my beloved Everwood has come to a close, I would like WB to release the rest of the episodes on DVD. Everwood has made me laugh, ponder, cry, and taken me right through so many parallel situations to my own life in the storyline, sometimes it was freaky. My heart would soar or shatter with each character's trials or triumphs. I need this show for all time. Release the last seasons please. Impatiently awaiting - Heather Franz"
5,Amazing...,"Everwood is a fabulous show that deserves much more credit and attention than it has received. I got into the show late, but fell in love with it immediately and was VERY upset to discover the only season on DVD so far, is Season 1. We have crap like the Anna Nicole Smith show or The Bachelore on DVD, but not the 2-4 seasons of Everwood. What a shame! I hope the network or studio or whoever is responsible, gives the Everwood fans what they want and release them. The series finale was amazing and the journey all the characters make is a must see. Well written, beautifully acted and staged. Don't miss it! (And let us have the rest!)"
5,The best show not on television,"Everwood deals with difficult situations such as abortion, suicide, drugs, and other subjects that most shows choose to ignore. It is a wonderfully acted, beautifully written, thought provoking artistic endeavor that many people from different backgrounds can thoroughly enjoy. I know I have. I hope to purchase the remaining seasons as soon as possible."
4,awesome news,"i am so happy that they came out with this dvd, i can hardly wait until the 2nd season comes out because this show is awesome. Thanks you so much."
2,Really bad role models!,"I have raised 3 children to adulthood, 2 boys and 1 girl. Never, ever would I have allowed them to treat me like those children in the ""highly acclaimed Everwood show"" treated their parents. I wonder what is wrong with the parents of America these days that they think this is acceptable behaviour?My husband and I will give this series away, it is not worth watching a second time!"
5,Heartwarming,"The WB has power, Putting out Everwood on DVD will give it's fans the warm feeling inside again and again. A garanteed good show for the whole family to enjoy on a rainy day."
5,Best show I've watched on TV in a very long time..,"I love this show and am sad to see it be cancelled. I would def. buy all seasons of the show and hope they release all of them. This show was touching, heart-warming and real and always made me laugh or cry. I can watch it over and over again. Def. worth it - you have to get a copy!"
5,One of the best TV shows ever!!,I just finished watching the complete first season last night and I am now so looking forward to the second season.This show is from real life and I loved every episode of it. I used to watch bits and pieces of the episodes on TV till I decided to give it a try and buy the whole season and it was worth every penny.Please do not let us wait for a long time and release the second season on DVD. We all are waiting for it.
4,Where are the other seasons???,The show is great like most commenst wrote before. But there is one thing i don`t get. Why aren't the other seasons not available yet? I would buy them and i'm waiting now for more then six months for at least season two.Come one Warner! Put it out!
5,Best TV Show,This was one of the best Shows on TV and I hate that they took it off the air. I truly miss it and the people who starred in it. I hope they will come out with the other Season's for sale as so far only Season One is available.
3,Everwood,DVD pack came with 3 of the DVD's loose in the packaging so all three were scratched up pretty bad. This was my first purchase through Amazon and was a little disappointed.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS STORE,"I ordered this product expecting it to be in great condition. What I got, however, was a disappointment. The case was broken, all of the dvd's fall out when I open it and half of the episodes either don't play or skip (I miss 3/4 of the episodes). Very disappointing. Save your money. I will not be ordering from here again."
1,Wow...,"Wow. What can I say. This is the worst, most predictable, badly acted show I've ever seen. I think it epitomizes the lazy thought so prevelant in America today. What is wrong with these people who like this crap? What redeeming qualities does this show have? I personally would rather sit down with a good book than have to go through this. The list of predictable, gag-me-with-a-spoon, sappy, and corny subjects that this parodic brain-rotter manages to ring off in a sigle episode is incredible!"
4,Everwood Season 1 Collection,"It's great! If you missed Season 1, you can go back and find out how it all started ... and ... it's completely commercial free! I would have rated it with a 5; however, I'm still waiting for Season 2 to be released."
3,"amazing show, but not my packaging","I adore everwood and could say a million good things about this show. However, I was not happy with this seasons packaging. It is a typical package for a dvd set...but mine fell apart when I opened it. All of the plastic sleeves for the dvds detached from the cardboard cover. It is as if the glue dried out. Also, I am a few disks in and one of my disks has been skipping a lot...to the point where one of the episode was hard to watch and I just turned it off. Great show and I prob just got a bad box. 3 stars due to the box and bad disk. I'd give the show alone 5 stars"
5,Very pleased with this product,"This DVD collection is priced right, good quality, has a sturdy storage case and I am very happy with my purchase. It arrived quickly and in perfect, NEW condition."
5,Best show on T.V.,Everwood is one of the best shows on t.v!!!! All I want to know is why it's only released one season on dvd when it is entering its fourth on t.v.??????
5,Nothing short of great.,"Anthony Green's voice soars, the two guitarists play resounding melodic lines, and the rhythm is tight. Every song is very expressive, exciting, and even haunting. The Great Golden Baby, Stop the Car, The Glorious Nosebleed, and the hidden track are the best. I know a popular comparison has been: imagine a male version Bjork mixed with alternative rock. I actually find that some what truthful, and I know I'm not the only one finds that combination to be tantalizing.If you like/dislike review let me know"
3,I tried...,...and tried and tried to get into this. I purchased the cd and I have seen them in concert twice(because of the other bands that were there)They put on a boring live show and songs start to sound the same. I just cannot get into it.
3,A 3.5,"This album is a good buy, but again, isnt incredibly spectacular. It has many good songs, but it will never truly live up to Anthony's saosin days."
2,Really cool......but then...,"The cool cover drew me in. I then downloaded the tune ACT APPALLED and was floored at how cool this band was. The music was hard, cool, and unique. I was really exited because this was the first band that really rocked with a female singer. I was set to buy, however I was curious about the band so I sought more info. Upon reading (and re-reading in disbelief) that the lead vocalist was in fact a dude, my interest deflated like a balloon over open flame. He REALLY sounds like a chick. Damn shame."
4,Not bad!,This is a pretty good album from Circa. I have played it a few times now and I have come to the conclusion that it does not change much from their previous album Blue Sky Noise. So it has the same basic sound but over all it is a good listen.
5,Amazing.,"This cd is absolutely incredible. This is the debut cd from Circa Survive, and it doesn't disappoint. Anthony (ex-Saosin) has an incredible singing and songwriting ability. The lyrics are stunning and powerful. The music is mellow rock and it really brings out the vocals. Go pick this cd up right now. I don't even have the right words to describe it."
4,Radiohead it ain't. but close,I love this band. They give me a radiohead vibe to them. I enjoy their writing and along with the vocals and music in the cd. One of the best cd's to come out this year..
5,Trust everyone on here when they say 'Juturna' is amazing..it is!,"Circa Survive's 'Juturna' is an incredible album altogether. At first listen, the vox, to me, were a little too girly for my taste. But as I listened on, the feeling and emotion packed with unnoticably in-depth guitar riffs [give Act Appalled's chorus a really close listen..the guitar's shredding is amazing! You can see it live, too] capture your ears instantly!!'Juturna' almost has that electronica feel to it. Enough to be noticed, and too little to say its cheesy. If you like Saosin, Coheed and Cambria, Kaddisfly, ect. definitely give this CD a try! (Don't forget about the awesome hidden track about 10 minutes into the last song!!)I'll bet Saosin regretted not waiting for their former singer who's now the pilot of Circa Survive. :)"
