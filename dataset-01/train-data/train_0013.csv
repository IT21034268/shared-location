3,Not terrible if you're a women,I am 5'5 and weigh 125. These weights definitely seem like they'd be a bit better of a fit for a larger man. I can't get them tight enough around my legs so they don't slip a little.That being said I do still use them.
4,bringing a little hope back to the USA,"with a brilliant blend of dazzling melodies (sometimes in the vein of early Split Enz but mostly 60's pop , sometimes bubblegum) tony carbone (who is this fella....i wanna meet him) puts together 13 cuts so cute and so impressive youd like to see BIKERIDE get a break. my fave cuts are 13, 10, and 4.....but all are grand. synths find their place throughout the album giving it a very modern, almost avant-garde feel, fusing the nicest things about pop into some nice jams. granted, one must be sophisticated musically to apppreciate this.JEALOUSY HANGS....dave cass"
1,too large,"I tested this product out on 3 different cats. I guess the aroma appealed to them because they tried to eat it, but not one of them was able to The pieces are just too large. I think they are too hard as well."
4,Rock 'n' Roll School!,"A Legendary rock 'n' roll performer. A lot of his songs were covered or plagiarized. This is dirty rock 'n' roll with a little jazzy feel. The collection is featuring 29 songs that were recorded between 1953 and 1958. Some songs are issued here for the first time (""My New Pink Suedes"", ""Rock 'n' Roll School"",...)."
4,If You Like the Band....,"Clapton has said of The Band's ""Music from Big Pink"" that it ""changed my life."" ""No Reason to Cry"" may not be Clapton at his best, but if you like The Band (as I do), then you'll probably enjoy this compact disc.Many of the songs sound like they could be from The Band, except for Clapton's voice. Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko and Richard Manuel play backup for Clapton, and members of The Band wrote two of the tracks: ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""All Our Past Times."" Danko shares lead vocals with Clapton on ""All Our Past Times.""There are two outstanding tracks on this cd: ""Hello Old Friend"" and ""Black Summer Rain."" ""Black Summer Rain"" evokes The Band's ""It Makes No Difference"" both in sound and lyrics (""...and the sun don't shine anymore, and the rain falls down on my door...""). Listen to the two songs one after another and you'll see what I mean.This album ain't Clapton's greatest but, to me, it's still good and well worth experiencing."
3,No Reason to Get Excited,"""No Reason to Cry"" is one of Eric Clapton's lesser orginial studio albums. The problem is in the material, which is simply not up to the incredibly high standards of Clapton 1970s masterpieces such as ""461 Ocean Blvd."" and ""Slowhand."" That's not to say the album is awful. In fact, there is hardly a bad song in the mix. It just doesn't live up to expectations. For example, the Clapton-Bob Dylan collaboration on the song ""Sign Language"" is pleasant enough, but is not the masterpiece you would expect from these two music giants.Overall, ""No Reason to Cry"" should be primarily of interest to Clapton's ardent fans. Casual listeners should start with one of the two albums listed above or one of his anthology albums instead."
3,"THE MUSIC TRIES TO AROUSE, BUT GOES BLAH... TOO MANY DRINKS","I'm a git player over 35 years and love EC. This release on his comeback trail in '76 is not much to get happy about. Reports circulated at the time of these recording sessions had found EC drinking very hard and surrounded by the same type of musicans involved. Ex Herion addicts usually go to Alcohol to relieve the JUNK pain from Herion. It is no reason that this release fell on deaf ears when first issued. EC's playing is stiff and mediocre. Even the bonus track added on the CD ""LAST NIGHT"" does not leave you filled or do any justice. He is stiff on all his git work on this album. A shame. Maybe I'm just to critical, but others felt the same way. judging by the cover of EC in a bar with bottles of liquor in front of him answers these downer gaps."
5,"...could've, should've, would've....","This album was to have been a collaborative work of Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton. But Dylan just liked to play his music and get on with it, while Slow Hand was forever and a day refining and refining and refining. So Dylan, frustrated, laid down ""Sign Language"" and then just walked away from the project. That song happens to be the best track on an otherwise not-too-shabby effort in its own right, but the question always will beg to be asked...what might have been?For some reason this work is never recognized for its intrinsic qualities, but in some respects it represents the best of what the various Eric Clapton personae were about. Dylan, of course, is Dylan. Good stuff!"
4,Under-rated,"I think this album/cd is the most under-rated project of Eric Clapton. It has a fine bunch of tunes and various styles and sounds very much like the fine material on ""Slowhand""."
5,Great Clapton Album!,Clapton just has so many great albums. No Reason To Cry is no exception. Every song on the album is great. Buy it.
1,Fall asleep at the Tertulia,"This novel was a huge disappointment. The idea--of mostly Latino women coming together to discuss the vicissitudes of life--is original, but the novel just sputters along. Part of the problem is that the dialogue is reduced to idle chatter and the narrator remains aloof and--do I dare say it--boring. The reader never gets a sense of how the advice of the Latino women influences her life in any deep way. The writing, also, is a disappointment: flat and uninspired."
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"I was soooo looking forward to reading this book but it just didn't do it for me. I was intrigued by the meetings of women of various generations and the Spanish (food) theme--just the right mix for me, so I thought. It just dragged and never made me feel involved or care about the characters. :("
3,Easy Read,"The Sunday Tertulia was an easy read. The story line was easy to follow and quite enjoyable. The book consist of 208 pages and I read it in a few hours. Only one problem that I had was the book took a little long to deliver, but other than that I have no complains."
3,the sunday tertulia,"For years I was one of the guys. It is only since graduating from college and joining the ""real world"" that I've developed girlfriends. This book made me think of our girls' night out meetings over coffee and wine, times that I both need and treasure.I had been expecting more of a novel, more details about the characters' lives. The chapters, instead, were a brief statement of the characters' current lives and the reactions of the tertulia attendants. I did feel like there was wisdom and truth in the women's thoughts. One thing I did especially like was that the author made sure to provide translations of the Spanish comments and proverbs."
3,Tedious,"I found this book tedious. I was very shocked to see it has 5 stars with 85 reviews, very overhyped."
2,I dissent. I thought it was tedious.,"It just didn't hit the spot for me. I found the whole religious thing to be irrelevant. The exoctic mystical eastern religious fascination came across as being dated to me, a bit of a hippy/60s thing. And because of that, I was not really motivated to suspend my disbelief. It all seemed like magic rather than science, and therefore just a bit silly. If the story and the characters had resonated with me, maybe I would have liked all the battles and action at the end, but it all came across as a bit Bruce Willis-esque.I did like the line ""the fit hit the Shan"", though."
1,Huxley it ain't...,"I'm afraid that I must agree with the comments of 'Tedious' below. Apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel (eastern religion meets western technology) their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half-way mark. This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors, but I must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy. The narative reads like a poor translation. Really bad style. A few funny moments... but overall, a very dissapointing book for me considering it's high falutin' reputation. I'll stick with Huxley, if and when I seek enlightenment."
5,Gone through 2 copies - Can't wait for the Kindle edition,"I read roughly a book a week. This is one of my favourites. I've re-read it enough to have two copies fall apart. It's a challenging read, but a great one."
5,"One of the Best, but not for the inexperienced reader","This is clearly one of the greatest SF novels of all time, but the novice reader of Science Fiction should put off reading it till they are more familiar with the genre. Zelazny was a master of one of the special joys of SF: the joy of figuring out what is going on. (note that in the first Amber novel, the narrator has amnesia and you are right there with him figuring out what is going on....) At first glance Lord of Light might seem a religious mish mash, but in fact is a techno/politico masterpiece (a really wild technolgy but not so unfamiliar politics...) Combined with the out of order chapters, it is easy to see how someone who had not read much science ficture could find this book incomprehensible. But it will give great enjoyment to the more experienced reader, (and re-reader.)"
5,Don't let this be your first Zelazny book... or your last!,"This is a great book, but it is also a long and complex book. It is not a fast read. It would help if you knew something of the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. I was suspicious at first that the author would write and write and write and then end the book without finishing it, if you know what I mean. I HATE it when a writer does that. Rest assured that Roger Zelazny finishes what he starts. If you want proof, then read his book This Immortal. It too, is a great book but way easier to read than Lord of Light. Zelazny is a fantastic writer. The images he creates in you might are nothing short of spectacular. When the book was written in 1967 motion picture special effects were not up to the task. Now though, in 2002, after Lord of the Rings, I wonder..."
3,A touch more light is needed,"Zelazny is one of those wonderful authors who like to give you a wink and a nudge right in the middle of his science fiction musings. A version of a comedian saying, ""Stay with me folks."" If you just read over the last word of chapter one, you will not realize that most of the rest of the book is a flashback. Come prepared: It would not hurt if you read up on the Hindu religion, mythology, and philosophy, since Roger assumes every-body knows these subjects. Also, there is no explanation how the characters got themselves in the ridiculous situation they are in, and who take themselves way to seriously. Zelazny's work is worth the read, especially with his breezy writing style. N.B. This book received the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel, something I cannot agree with, because it is so obscure in its' background, and the assumption the western reader knows much about Hinduism."
5,"Zelazny's best, and one of the best ever.","I read this novel in 1970 a couple of years after it was first published, and probably half a dozen times since. This story works on many levels, making it enjoyable to a wide audience. Its works as an adventure novel, a mythological fable, and as hard sci-fi with a sharp edge of social conscience. The characters are well developed throughout the story, but only late in the plot line do we really begin to understand their true motivations. And from start to finish, there's enough mystery, intrigue, and action to satisfy most anyone. In the end, the story works as a parable illustrating the greed, and lust for power common in human nature and history. It shows as well, that the true motivation of our ""heroes"" is seldom what it appears on the surface to be. So, whether you enjoy Lord of Light as a fantasy, an adventurous escape from reality, hard Sci-Fi, or as social commentary on human weaknesses, excesses, and strengths, enjoy it you most certainly will!"
5,My favorite book of all time,"I've read science fiction since the third grade, and I've read alot. I am now in my early forties and have recently reread Lord of Light. It is still my favorite book. It is thought provoking, full of colorful characters, and as is often the case in Zelazny's books, it has a reluctant hero/protagonist (Sam/Buddah) whose primary attribute is his humanity. Ultimately, Sam's heroism is demonstrated by his ability to convince his peer's of their own ties to humanity."
3,He may be an influencial musician but.........,"He was an influencial musician yes. He did a lot for music yes. And that is admirable. But it doesn't change the fact that he was and most likely still is a woman beater. In this book he tries to justify it. And that's not right. I think his music is great, but I don't care how great it is, I will never have any respect for him because he thought women were just objects for his amusment. And he obviously still does. He may have learned something from his hard earned experiences, but not enough. I feel sorry for any woman who ever dates or marries this man. Tina Turner did the right thing in leaving him, and she has more strength than he ever will."
3,Its an ok read,"While I appreciate Ike's side of the story, he was not upfrint about his abuse of Tina. He writes as if the relationship was great and Tina loved the fact that he cheated constantly. I am not one sided and do believe that she was tolerant of his cheating, but I doubt she was ok with it. He does not speak much of the physical abuse, and if you read the book , you will see that he doesnt believe that he was abusive. He's not hiding it, he just doesnt believe that its wrong. In fact he views it as a regular part of a relationship, and he doesnt understand why his women were leaving him. I actually pity him. But he was as honest as possible, and I do believe that after reading this book, a lot of what was in the movie,was a complete lie."
1,Through the Madness!!!,"First of all, Ike is doing the very thing that Tina always said he would do. Ike Turner will never admit to what he did to Tina. Tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like ""all the others."" Ike took advantage of her. Tina her self said she cared very much for him. Cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince Tina to leave him. Even the girls that danced with Tina on stage had whitnessed what happened.Tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career, she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. So she released her autobiography in 1986, well after her come-back in 1984.While Ike can try to deny it all he wants, the truth is he violently abused Tina! And considering the person Ike Turner is, I would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!!"
1,"""Takin' Back My Name"" Hardly Ike","In this sad excuse of a memoir Ike Turner tries and tries and tries to convince us that he is a good person. WRONG! Instead he comes off as a psychopathic obsessive fool who ruined the best thing in his life when he destroyed his relationship with the wonderful TINA. He also jumps back and forth with his opinion on TINA but hey who cares? We must remember that HE BEAT HER UP and like the old saying goes ""A leopard cannot change its spots"" or to quote Marlo Thomas on ""Friends"" ""once a cheater always a cheater"" Take that, Ike."
1,Item is not as durable as it seems...,"After spending a significant amount of time trying to remove the U3 software that comes on this drive (I wanted to remove it because I don't use windows, and yet the removal software only works for windows) the connection between the actual USB plug and the body of the device gradually weakened (so that to get the device to read I had to wiggle it) until the it became useless. I would recommend Kingston over this, as I've never heard of any durability problems with those, and with these you risking getting a lemon."
2,"good when it works, but garbage in two month's time","I bought two of these drives at the same time. The one is still going strong, but the other crashed, never to be revived, about six months from purchase. I returned it under warranty and SanDisk sent a replacement. It's not my drive fixed and, of course any information I had on the drive is gone. Okay, I could deal with that, but now that drive has also crashed and burned. There's no reviving, formatting or recovering my information....again. This time I trashed the drive; I'd kept good back-ups of all the information, I'm only out my original purchase price and postage to return it the first time. This is my last SanDisk purchase...fool me once, but not twice."
3,Crash problems,"Although I never used the U3 application that comes with the Cruzer Titanium, it died anyway. It has become completely unreadable by any computer for no apparent reason. In reading reviews on this and other websites, this seems to be a recurring problem with the Cruzers although most attribute it to the U3 software utility. While the casing does make it extremely rugged and the slide/LED design is both convenient and visible, it means nothing if the drive itself is unstable and can't keep your data secure. While I can't recommend it, if you must buy this product, back up your data regularly or don't trust it with anything you can't afford to lose."
3,There are better choices,"This drive is Ok, but IMHO there are better choices.I bought the drive because of the retractable usb port, and that is a nice feature. But, when I bought the drive I was unaware of all the junk they put on it; by junk, I mean ""features"". Although their software hasn't crashed my system, it is unnecessary, uses up valuable space (you are buying a storage device, right?) and makes backing up/ transferring data unnecessarily complicated.I also own (several) Kingston flash drives- very simple to use. Myself, I prefer the Kingston. What I am looking for in a flash drive is storage, plain & simple. I don't want it adding another backup program, or games...just storage. That's what I get with the Kingston drives, and I will stick with them from now on."
3,a little disappointed,"It has a nice sleek look and seems like it will be more durable than the regular ones. The only downside is that this was purchased to take things back and forth from computer to computer-and should be able compatible to anything. However, it does not work with an external USB hub-which just happens to be our main purpose for it. So we're back to using the cheaper/ plainer version.My husband and I have the same ones except his is the titanium version, and he's still always having to rely on mine, b/c his is not compatible. It seems like if one SanDisk 2 GB flash drive would work on an external USB hub-one with a titanium cover would also-but no-it doesn't."
1,Buyers Beware,"After using this flash drive for multiple types of files I am very very disappointed. At first my only concern was that the USB felt sloppy. But now I can't get this thing to hold any information on my spreadsheets that I use on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I properly eject the device only when I get the message that it is safe. Then I will plug it in again and make sure my spreadsheet is there. Then eject the device again. But when I restart the computer and insert the cruzer my spreadsheets are all kaddywampus with just a portion of the information. It works fine for my word documents and photos, but not spreadsheets. I now purchased a kingston flash drive and pray it works better."
4,Better smelling air.,My Bosch vacuum was a couple of years old and had seen some fairly heavy use. I had begun to notice stinky air at the exhaust when even a new bag was only partially full. By replacing the existing filter with the Micro/Charcoal filter I have eliminated the stinky exhaust.
3,Not a favorite in my house,"I have 2 kids ages 1 and 4. Neither is particulary interested in this toy or any of the pop-onz for that matter. I agree with another reviewer, get the megabloks for building and the fisher price farm for pretend play. They both have more long lasting play appeal than this toy."
3,Not much interest,My daughter doesn't show much interest in the toy. Maybe when she gets older she will play with it. She is 19 months old now. **added** My daughter is now 23 months old and still doesn't play with this toy and has not interest. She likes her little people stuff better. What a waste.
5,Step into Ancient Greece,"This is the best series of books I have found for history for 9-12 year olds. I teach 4th and 5th graders and they love these books. They have interesting pictures and are written at the perfect level. I like all the art project ideas they include, the organized method in which they are written, and the timeline which runs the bottom of the pages. This is a great resource. I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,not very impressed,"i bought the DVD because i though they wouldn't just give the blue collar name to anyone... turns out they did.Caparulo was okay but the other 3 guys were not as good as i would have hoped. I think maybe i have been spoiled by the likes of bill, ron, jeff and larry."
3,product was fine,"Product was fine, the show wasn't, should just let it be and watch the ones I know I will like"
5,One of my all time favorites,I have been looking for this album in CD form since my turntable died and never could. This is one of my all time favorites and I was devistated when I couldn't listen to it. It brings back some very pleasant memories and I always long for them when I hear this great album. I hope everyone gets a chance to listen to the great vocal qualities of the members of LRB. They blend in a way few bands ever have. The words of Cool Change are powerful and speak of a point in my life when I knew it really was time for a change. What a great album!
1,Bummer - also burned,"I read a review of this book at woodworker's gazzette and it was really positive. So I ordered the book and it arrived last week.This book is cursury in its treatment of the topic and has no answers to any of the questions I was interested in. For example there is no discussion of stone tiles, heating systems for tiles, width of groutlines. This book is embarrasing. I have a book from Home-Depot on tiling that is superior to this one in simple answers to simple questions.My advice - avoid this book and look elsewhere for your info."
4,We'll see,"Just received this item today. It finally arrived, not sure wh it took so long from McLendons.Just sprayed it on my plants, I'll let you all know how it works when I have results."
4,Written by a participant in the revolution,"Because the author "" lived"" the revolution, this is a very interesting book. Incredibly detailed from an emotional and time reference. I really enjoyed. Difficult read-not for those who like light fiction or broad quick history.. Must be a history buff to read. You might need a reference to read i.e. Wikepedia-I did."
3,ecm production overwhelms,I bought this album after hearing the duet between Rava & Petrella (trombone) which is a delight. After several listening very little of the rest of the album comes close to the immediacy & intimacy of this piece. I believe the ECM production has in this case overwhelmed the music in a too beautiful & shiney sugar-coated casing. I prefer the earlier album(s) Rava made with Rosewell Rudd on trombone that exuded a rough vitality. Never-the-less there is still some exceptional moments to be enjoyed provided you can squint your ears through the ECM glare.
4,True Stories! Great interviews! But too scary!,"This documentary was good! It talks about the real truth about Jim Jones! And I Quote people were blinded by this coward and has mislead them about taking them to the promise land, and that's how people were killed, a few survived. And his wife ""Merciline"" is responsible for the people at the temple as well. it is a sad story. A real sad story.It really breaks my heart to see people died in vain! Just remember things ain't always peaches and cream.Dee SmallsDecatur GA"
2,Kind of a sleeper,Kind of puts you to sleep unless you are totally interested in Jones. Sad that he got so many people to follow him all the way to death via Kool Aid.
2,Unneccessarily Bad Language,"Unneccessarily bad language comes out of no where in the middle of this documentary. Not what I expected in a PBS documentary. For someone expecting to be shocked, this is for you. Adults only language. Be warned."
4,Still sounds good,"I've had this album since it was released. It was unusual then, and it's unusual now - but still good. Like a dark Tindersticks with distorted guitar. If you want to hear something different, try this."
3,Lemmy-from-Motorhead's psych album,"Yes, it is Lemmy (Ian Willis) singing and playing lead on this. Interesting to hear an earlier version of Hawkwind's (and Motorhead's) ""The Watcher,"" called ""You're Alone Now."" Also, the third track sounds a lot like Motorhead's ""Dead and Gone"" (I think; if not that, another one of the songs on Snake Bite Love) from 1998. You got to hand it to Lemmy for recycling 30-year-old material. Even though this might have been a hastily conceived novelty band, featuring Sam Gopal's tabla, which is pushed up in the mix, the album is solid."
3,not stellar,"i bought this because rose tinted glasses was so good. i dont know about these tracks really. they would be tolerable if they were mixed continuously. if hes such a good mixer, he could have easily mixed this album together. anyway, its an alright CD"
5,LOVE IT!,"Love Redkin Spray Starch! I can go to bed with wet hair and still style as usual in the mornings -- (and my hair doesn't break or feel damaged!) I would definitely recommed this product for women with longer hair styles - mine is about shoulder-length. Feels sticky at first, but the heat breaks the product down and hair feels natural."
5,growing in spiritual maturity,"in a quick reading of 'restless souls' i find persons of courage and determination who look beyond echoes to provide voices that help move us beyond traditionally divisive conceptions of faith and value toward building inclusive community characterized by respect, justice, and mercy. i look forward to spending more time here. gr"
4,Barhaiya! Really excellent,"This is a fantastic resource. I have just received my copy and already I am in love with it. It is very well-written, and strikes a nice balance between the structure of the langauge and usability. I especially like that the author is no fan of prescriptivists, and so presents ""Hindi as she is spoke"". I would not say that it is ""better"" than Snell's TYH, but it takes a slightly different approach, and is, in my opinion a great complement to the other work.My only gripes are the way that all the devanagari is stuck at the back (grr!) and that I had to buy the book and CD separately. Even with those minuses, it is absolutely worth it, and I would rate it a must have."
4,Very useful for me (expecially for the audio support),"I found it clear, gradual and (most over all) aware of the non-linguistic rules related to conversation. I disagree with the ""London reader"": I found the romanization good and easy to follow... maybe it's 'cause I'm italian or 'cause I was teaching myself Hindi just for pleasure, so I wasn't expecting nothing more than an aid!"
1,Only useful as a backup to Snell and Weightman,"If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as ""Teach Yourself Hindi"" does. The authors of that title, R.Snell & S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell & Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice."
5,Exactly what I've been needing!,"This is a fantastic book! I am a teacher and graduate student, but I could never manage to read the Bible. The significance of the passages always escaped me, the Bible seemed overwhelming and confusing, and I couldn't fathom how people could read so much into a single line. This book is exactly what I have been needing. The authors pick out a huge variety of Bible readings, and then explain their significance and context in a way that's both profound and completely understandable. I am finally able to see ""the big picture."" It's also removing a source of guilt from my life - one of those things that you don't realize is such a thorn in your side until it's gone. I've wanted to read the Bible for so long, but previously it just never ""clicked."""
3,A pleasant excursion. . .,". . .into Celtic mythology -- but certainly not Tolkien.Stephen Lawhead is a good author and I have enjoyed many of his books. He does his research and has the knack of being able to ""get into"" other cultures.The premise of this book: two Oxford graduate students who get transported through a sacred cairn into Another Place -- is an interesting theme and Lawhead works it fairly well. The character development is lacking at times and the development of character motives can be unnecessarily slow but there are moments of brilliance which do make the book worthwhile. (I particularly loved the encounter with the Serbian and his restaurant.)However, JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, and even Charles Williams have nothing to fear here -- Lawhead comes nowhere near to their level (or even to the level of Robert Jordan).Read this book, enjoy the series -- but don't expect ""The Lord of the Rings""."
3,"Grade: C- Avg. writing, < avg. dialogue, Slow plot","What's w/ all the 5 & 4 starred reviews??? The tale and writing was just barely avg., the dialogue between characters was stilted and not real, & the plot moved slowly at times and offered nothing new.Bottom line: I would not recommend this book to my adult friends. It might be a good book for a 10 - 14 year old youth."
2,Had potential but didn't reach it,I'm just an average over 50 person who likes fantasy fiction. This had great potential and the first half was entertaining & kept my interest. Second half dragged the story out alot until the climax. Not interested in a sequel unless it's half as long and concise.
5,"paradise war is one of the best series I,v ever read .thanks","I,v read this series three times and it still fasinates me!!!! ....sabrin"
4,"Good book all around, though I preferred the current-age bits","An American student in Oxford finds a way into the land of Albion, an ancient mythical version of Great Britain, where he is confronted with a rising battle between Good and and an ancient Evil.While the crux of the story is made up of pretty good light-fantasy gravitating around the Celtic folklore with occasional light Christian archetype overtones, surprisingly I actually preferred the earlier part of the book before Lewis (and his mate Simon) cross into the ""other side"". I just felt that the anticipation and humour that Lawhead shows in the current day part of the yarn gets lost and diluted once in Albion.While this is a shame, it's still a worthy book to take with you on a summer holiday."
3,Meh...,"It seemed like there were pieces of the book never explained later. There were parts that kind of rambled on for me, others probably enjoyed the extra detail.I don't regret the purchase, but won't be finishing the series."
4,Great Read,"I stumbled upon this book at work one day, and after finishing it I bought the entire series for myself to add to my library."
4,Good First-Person Historical Fantasy,"I got this book for free as a limited-time offer for Kindle, so I might be a little biased. That being said, I still think it's worth either buying or renting from the library. What's unique about it is that it is largely told from the first-person perspective of Lewis, an American college student studying at Oxford University in the UK. Lewis, following after his friend Simon, enters into the world of Albion which is styled after Celtic history and mythology. Many people are opposed to the book because of its Christian themes but I would say give it try anyway. It's a refreshing and unique take on historical fantasy."
2,"Eh, why such good reviews?","Another series created out of the idea that a run of the mill dude discovers an alternate world, where he all a sudden becomes courageous and forgets his past. Besides that, the build up of a great magical climax is greatly over hyped, as it falls flat. Dont buy this novel if you are looking for your next great fantasy read"
3,Super Reader,"A solid fantasy trilogy, with the often useful hook of placing a modern man into the setting - with the twist that he becomes one of the great Celtic heroes, but not quite how you expect. The other thing is that he is an arts grad student nerd, too, so even more surprising. Not remarkable though, certainly would not read it again. A grad student and friend go on a wild trip, and find a supposedly extinct prehistoric ox, then follow it, and end up in a Celtic mythic Albion, and have to adapt fast."
2,WARNING: Here there be monologue.,"Lawhead is, unfortunately, a very inconsistent writer. Sections of each book in this trilogy are excellent and quite enjoyable. However, there are longer portions that are awkward and tedious. The writer also commits a number of literary sins that drag the whole down. In the first book, there is the character of the professor. He is quite flat and is what is known as ""the author's mouthpiece""--a set-piece device used to conveniently convey information that the author has trouble working in otherwise. The professor has at least a couple long monologues that reek of the above device.Although there are worthwhile sections, I recommend you avoid this title and pick up something better."
4,A great read,"For those who love Celtic fiction, this is a must have. At times Lawhead suffers from mid-book doldrums, and this book is no exception; however, this is probably my favorite Lawhead book. Too bad the final one of the series has such a horrible ending and practically annihilates all of the hard work the author put into the first two books.4.5 stars"
5,good,Good book.well written and keeps your attention all the way through.excellent discriptive writing.
5,Lawhead's Best Work,"I've been an avid fan of Stephen Lawhead's work for some years now, and I truly believe that the Song of Albion triology is his best work to date. Our world is but a shadow compared to the world Lawhead creates when Lewis and Simon cross over into the Otherworld. It's incredibly vivid and the plot is so engaging and well thought out that you can't help but be drawn into it. Celtic mythology is also something so different from any other culture in the world, and Stephen Lawhead the master of the Celtic/Fantasy genre. I can't speak highly enough of these books, and for me they sit equal with 'Magician' and just below 'The Lord of The Rings' as all time fantasy classics."
1,It's not what you think,"This LOOKS like a less expensive version of the Spinbrush refill, but it is not. With this one, the bottom part does not move. Cheap junk! I don't know why they bother making it.Get the better one - it's worth it."
1,Wrong.. don't buy,It's not the same as the one the brush comes with. The top spins but you loose the up down motion from the brushes under the spin part. cheap knock off I guess. spend more get the right one. :(
1,Only half the head rotates,"I was thrilled to see what a bargain these replacement heads were compared to the store. I ended up throwing them out and going to the store. Don't waste your money. The top part of the head rotates, but the bottom half does nothing. The ""real"" ones, both parts of the head rotate. I don't know why this even says CREST on it."
5,Great,I love the SprinBrush heads for my toothbrush. These work so much better as both heads move and give me really clean teeth.
3,Great if you have the munchies!,"Not gourmet, which it isn't meant to be. Doesn't have a rich toffee or buttery taste, but it's OK. I'd prefer a stronger flavor. Great for kids!"
5,His books enlighten me!,I had studied a lot of techniques but Meisner. One day at the book store I decided to buy this book to start learning Meisner and when I finished the first one I ordered the rest right away. The technique is explained very clear. It is helpful for me as a teacher. I don't know how can he simplify this complicated exercises into something very concrete. It is a REAL workbook!

3,Not Much Different,I purchased a set of these and ran them up against a set of 72 standard prismacolor which I had previously. To be honest I really couldn't tell the difference. The only difference is the cost which is double or triple that of the standard set. The tin is a bit more compact making it a nice fit for my illustration tool bag so I will keep the tin but probably as they wear down will jut replace them with the standard ones.
5,Genius.,"Intriguing and excellently written music paired with delightfully surprising lyrics and an engaging, intimate style make this album a must-buy. If you like John Mayer, Josh Kelly, you'll adore Andy!!!!"
4,Sanctuary The Complete Second season,"This is an great serie. I don't have or want cable, I saw the show online and wanted to buy the DVD. Could not find in stores so I went to Amazon to find the show I want to buy. THe company delieved in a timely manner. How I just have to get season three, can't waite. I recommend this company they have reasonable prices and fast delievery."
3,character replacements.....it gets annoying,"Well I still like the show and the plot but I have one major problem. First they kill off Magnus's daughter, then they get rid of invisible girl. I liked both these characters. It appeared that everytime they started intigrating a young female actress into the show they would kill her off. It started to piss me off. Then Kate shows up. Now I like Kate. She is spunky and interesting but I keep thinking they are probably going to kill her off because the young female lead never seems to last long..."
5,Sanctuary: The Complete Second Season,"Thanks, Amazon, for making it so easy to keep getting seasons of my absolute favorite television series. Sanctuary and all the Stargate series are great!!! My whole family love Helen Magnus and her crew. Even gotmy husband, who is strictly a sports and western fan, to watch and now he's hooked. Never need to worry thatmerchandise will be anything but perfect when it arrives, barring any problems during transit."
1,Kali part 2,I wouldnt know if its any good. they have the wrong bloody episode. its still part 1. youd expect better from a site you have to Pay to Rent from. Not a happy camper.
5,classic,"I love this show. It keeps evolving ... change is good! The characters farmed from the SG1 and SGA series are great! I was missing Rodney when I first watched the webisodes!!!! Danial Jackson, Todd and Beckett!!! LOVE IT!!! The stories are fresh! Ugh I hate the ""continued"" at the end of the season!!! I am impatient!!! I like the new monsters weekly! Always a bad guy to contend with! I look forward to season three!!!"
2,Worst second season I've even seen,What happened to the writing on this show? Got rid of a great character and actress to replace her with a very unappealing replacement. Plot bounced all over the place.What a disappointment.
5,Sanctuary Fan,"Sanctuary is the best and very imaginative in it story lines. I love Amanda Tapping and the whole cast, they are so talented. The bonus features were great too, I liked hearing what they had to say about an episode or anything else. I love Sanctuary, I can not wait for season 3.Big Fan,Christine Martin"
2,They lost me at Bollywood,I was enjoying this series until the HORRIBLE Bollywood episode when the solution to the issue of a huge Abnormal who could move sections of the earth was a Bollywood-style dance. That ended it for me.
4,Sanctuary - 2nd,I was most impressed with the follow-up to Season 1. I so like the imagination which comes out in the range of creatures that are a part of the show.I am now looking at purchsing Season 3.
3,Please bring Ashley back!,"I love S.1. While watching S.2, I found myself thinking ""just bring Ashley back and it'll get better again"". I cannot bring myself to like Kate, I keep hoping they'll kill her off. And I found Magnus very grating after they killed off Ashley. Especially during the helicopter crash episode.Also, can someone tell me how Bigfoot, who was originally characterized as Magnus' butler, is now somehow qualified to help her in the operating room?! Please.The only reason I'm giving it three stars are for Nikola Tesla, who's awesome, and for ""Jack the Ripper"". I wish we saw them more. And I know Magnus' accent bothered some people, but I like it."
5,"Sanctuary, Season Two",Season two built on season one perfectly. I love this series and cannot wait until season three has been released so I can find out what happens to Will (and the world) in relation to Kali.
1,Poor Disc Packaging,Opened the First Season to play and 3 of the discs fell out of the packaging and were scratched. Trying to put the discs back is a real challenge. This is like no other disc packaging that I've ever seen. There is no center snap to put the disc in. You have to try to slide it into 4 plastic half circles(2 of which were broken in delivery) and 2 tabs at the bottom ( one which was broken in delivery). I am returning all seasons as it is not worth having packaging that is useless.
2,Good show but TERRIBLE packaging,"The other reviews cover the show well so I won't go into that, but I do want to warn you that the DVD case is really cheap, with the DVDs doubled up in the same slot. For the sake of 10 cents cost to them, they have produced something that is very likely to scratch your DVDs."
3,Missing episodes?,"I watched episodes 1-12 on Hulu. Episode 12 was a two-parter that ended with ""continued"", so it was hard to judge if this was the actual season finale or not.13 episodes seems awfully short for a season, even for cable. I was a bit disappointed after the promise of Season 1.That said, I am planning to watch Season 3 when it becomes available. I think the show is worth watching, especially if they concentrate on some of the supporting characters (Christopher Heyerdahl in the dual role of Bigfoot/Jack the Ripper, and the inventor Nikola Tesla played as a vampire)."
1,Nothing More Than A Cheesy Summary,"For a Finance Professor at NYU this book should be an embarrassment. It is not only poorly written, but dispenses absolutely no advice. The book has no appeal at all, and is merely a summary of the existing wealth holders. I mean who cares how much Mike Tyson earnt in 1997. This is hardly aspirational stuff. If wealth creation is the topic that a reader is pursuing I would strongly recommend Peter Drucker (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), which will give the reader a clear insight into why Americans have expanded their wealth, without the rhetoric. Another great book would be by Lester Thurow (Creating Wealth) who explains how wealth is created. As far as this book is concerned, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Waste of money,"I found this book on special for 5 Australian dollars so I picked it up. I didn't get around to reading it for a little while but I should have never bothered in the first place for a few reasons.The book is too focused on the american economy and had very little information which could be linked to Australia's economy.From the first page it presented itself as a very bland read, giving barely any encouraging information for anyone wanting to expand on their finances. I stopped reading after the second chapter as it just had no appeal to me.I do not recommend this book at all."
1,"Not accurate, needle gets stuck","Maybe it's just the hot summer temperatures where we live (in Texas), but this thermometer turned out to be pretty useless - when the day got hot and the needle went up above 90 degrees, it would get stuck there and would not go down when the temperature went down. Plus when the thermometer arrived, it didn't tell the accurate temperature - the directions say you have to set it to the correct temperature by turning a screw at the back, which we did, but then after that it would get stuck as described above. Very disappointing product."
1,Dont waste your $$$$$ on this.,"Could not get it to stick to the window. Would stick it to the window and it would fall off every 10 to 20 min. Even got it wet for better suction, lasted about an hour before it fell off. Gave up after that. Unknown if thermometer worked. Never got it to stick."
2,"Great Name, Inadequate Guage",Arrived fast but the product needed to be calibrated upon arrival. As a matter of fact I've been calibrating this one frequently and it's still lucky to get within 2 degrees of the actual temperature. It just requires too many adjustments and remains too inaccurate. It is big and readable and sticks to the window. Unfortunately this is a case of an inadequate product distributed by a well known name brand.
1,inaccurate and useless,"Why have a thermometer if the thing doesn't reflect the correct temps? This one is a waste of money. Growing up, Timex was a great brand name. Now it's a joke. So sad.Don't buy the Timex ... go to Target and buy an inexpensive outdoor digital suction cup thermometer by Accurite, with big numbers. That way you can return it if it doesn't work to your satisfaction."
3,window thermometer,Happy with product. The whole thermometer is a suction cup which makes it firmly stuck on window. A little hard to read at night -I use a small penlite that does the trick.
1,Worst Ever,"This product is fantastic for those whose climate never varies by more than one degree. When I saw the name ""Timex"" I was somewhat apprehensive but said to myself, ""How can they mess up a thermometer?"". I don't know how they did it but they did, big time. Admittedly, for $5.99 I didn't expect a device approved by the National Weather Service but this product is overpriced by about $5.98. Rather than going through the hassle of returning it I joyously took a hammer to it and took out many inner frustrations. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy."
1,Pricing Backwards... used is more then new???,That just doesn't make since to me. The used price is $39.99 amd the new is $24.99I don't need it that bad.Was going to use it to teach my assistant.
1,"Boy, was I disappointed!","I have to disagree with the reviewers who gave this book high marks. While Jim Richey is very knowledgeable, this book is a set of one-page clippings from various past magazines. The drawings are very basic, and there's not a single photograph to help the beginning to moderate woodworker. These tips are too basic for the advanced woodworker, so I really don't see an audience for this book. It didn't help me at all. There's nothing wrong with the book -- if you want to read about other people's woodworking. However, to help you build your router skills there are wiser ways to spend your money. Several are sold right here on Amazon."
2,"Decent prog, but a bit boring","These guys are in the same category as RPWL. Their music is decent, enteretaining - basically some good tunes. But some of the songs that are longer get boring because there is no new music introduced - they just keep repeating the basic tune. These guys certainly don't come close to the masters of prog like Genesis, Marillion, Flower Kings, IQ, etc. I wouldn't buy any more of their CD's based on this one."
2,Weighed down,"2 1/2Stagnant and stilted for the most part, the awkwardly translated prog-pop will appeal only to loyalists of the sub-genre."
2,product good... wrong picture,product was as described except picture was entirely different. One large lady but in the middle not many. I would have preferred as pictured but not worth returning was will serve as bib just the same.
2,"Cute Design, Poor Construction",I bought this bib for my daughter to wear at her ladybug themed 1st birthday. It only lasted a few times after that before it started falling apart.
5,So organized now!,"When I first got the bag I thought the color was a bit too neon for me but I decided that the great features of the bag far outweighed the color. Now, I am way over the color and actually really like it now. I think this bag is amazing. I love all the room, tons of pockets, it's easy to wear, it's iPod friendly and I really like that it hangs from my stroller. I think they thought of just about everything when designing this bag. I recommend this bag to every mom out there. Don't be afraid of the green. It's totally retro and it grows on you very fast. I'd buy it all over again."
2,Puzzling Accounting of Facts,"I am puzzled at why Sampson would set out to deminish Jones and his family. I noted that some of ""his"" facts are actually completely different in other books that are exhaustively researched such as Mark Frost's book The Grand Slam and others I have read including Down the Fairway by Jones himself. Even if everything negative he came up with was true it isn't really very much in light of the great man that he was. He was a man of impeccable character but he was a human being. He was sensitive and conscientious, intellegent, honest and gracious above all.Even so, I enjoy reading anything about Jones which has led to my reading of other books of this era and books about Walter Hagen etc. I enjoyed the pictures."
1,Cheap imitation,"We have Bosch vacuum for 9 years, and original turbo-brush finally broke. We ordered this brush and it's not even close to the performance of the original. We have a dog and it's now impossible to remove dog's hair from the area rugs. I guess we have to buy a new vacuum now."
5,Political Dub for the 21st century,"I picked this CD up in spain and upon coming back to the united states was surprised that ADF's CDs were nowhere to be found in american record stores. But after a listen to Community music you can understand why. This album has grooves that infect your mind and some of the most powerful anti-capitalistic lyrics around. If your a fan of reggae, dub, indian music, techo, or just meaningful music, this cd is a must buy."
5,A Rare Find,"First published in Hungary in 1940, this is the first English publcation of this novel.The story is an erotic telling of the story of Giacomo Casanova after his escape from Venice's most infamous jail. He goes to Bolzano to rebuild his life and to resume his life of seduction. He picks Bolzano because of his history with the place and this particular lady. The story picks up when her husband, the elderly duke ....Well you can guess the story from there. It marks the second novel of Sandai Marai that's in print. It also makes you wonder what other great novels were printed in a time, place and language waiting to be rediscovered."
4,Sic Transit Romantic Love,"If a book is new to me, I tend to skip the intros, whether the translator's, author's or critic's. I picked CAZANOVA up based on a review I scanned, without reading closely. So it wasn't until near the end of it that I realized ""this cannot be a contemporary novel"". One of its characters--and a remarkable one--espoused as fine and powerful a description of true romantic love as exists in literature, I felt. The sad thing was, in reading it, I knew this was a dated novel. That notion of romantic love was in that ""fine and private place/where none I fear do embrace"", as far as I could tell.This novel is about love. In a sense, it makes a lovely headstone for the notion of romantic love."
4,Watch review,"This is the second watch I have bought that is the same style but different color. The watch itself is wonderful! The only problem I see is that the color stated Sky Blue and when the watch came to my door, its more turqouise not sky blue at all? Which was fine because it was a gift and my mother in law loves turqouise but i was expecting sky blue!"
5,best fit ever for on-line purchase,"these are the best ever fit and comfort shoes i have ever purchased online I am on my feet for hours and my feet feel great , Jessica Simpson shoes are to die for."
3,Cute but VERY painful!,"I love the way these look however, they hurt soooo bad!! I stand in heels everday, all day, so my feet have been trained to wear uncomfortable shoes for long periods of time. If you plan on standing or dare I say WALKING around in these beware your feet will hate you!!! My feet are covered in blisters right now from these shoes."
5,Work it!,I love this shoe! I tried it on at Macy's and looooved it! I actually bought the wrong size on Amazon and had to return them but i will definitely get them again in the correct size! Because of the patent leather they fit really snug so i'd go with your size or just a 1/2 size below your normal size. These make your legs look long and gorgeous move over boots I believe these pumps were made for walking the streets of our city and the hallways at the office! Jessica's shoes are so beautiful and fit great. Work it girls!
5,jessica simpson shoes- lovely as always,"well fitting and sexy shoes. unique subtle colors. i highly recommend. i have many pairs of jessica simpson shoes, and i've been very pleased with each one."
2,run 1/2 size small & painful,"I got them in Saddle Croco, which are gorgeous with a good mix of black and brown.I usually wear 6 1/2, thus 7 in Jessica Simpson. They fit ok, but because of the height, I get a bit of room in the back of my heels. Plus they are excruciating, even with Foot Petals Tip Toes."
2,really cute but..,(I bought the pink nubuck shoes)these shoes are really really cute and they are comfortable BUT i sprayed them with nubuck protectant and thought i would be ok. i wore them and the parking lot was slightly wet with rain and the bottom of the shoe (around the edges of the sole) is REALLY faded. then my jeans touched the back of them and made weird marks on the back and i must have had 1 or 2 raindrops hit them and there are spots. only wear these indoors with no chance of anything touching them besides your feet on the inside of them. i wish they had been leather. i spent the money on them for one night because i wont ever wear them again.
4,Cute shoe but!!!,Really cute sexy shoe but they do run small and they are very high as well but it said they were stilettos. I love them and I also look the red color.
4,Coffee Filters,These were rather expensive to purchase over the internet. I've been able to find Bunn filters much cheaper locally. I am happy with the response from this seller.
1,Sayin dis is good is a joke,"I mean after 2 good hits I thought I'd check dis out. Well just like every other bling, bling, pop rapper, the rest of the album just wasn't worth it. I mean I hate it when rappers use nice songs as hits but make the rest of the album garbage, just to make sales. I like no limit but I don't like this CD. I can't recomend this at all. Just pass on this, unless u r a die hard sillk fan."
1,he lost it a long time ago,"I was never really a big Silkk the Shocker fan, but I had to apllaud him for his 2nd album Charge it 2 da Game. Unfortunately, after Made Man No Limit fell off. Silkk is quite simply a copycat. There is not a unique track on the album. The tracks seem to be copied from previous Cash Money albums. Silkk annoys me because sometimes he is trying to be a thug and on other occasions he is preaching nonviolence and doing boy-girl collabos. Which one is it Silkk?The only real rappers on No Lmit were C-Murder, Mac, and Soulja Slim. Unfortunately C-Murder and Mac are on lock down and Slim is no longer with No limit. You should hear Slim's new album Years later a few months after. He said that he saw Silkk in a victoria's secret catalogue! P should give it up. He can't survive without Mac and C-Murder."
2,"I like C-Murder and Mac, but this guy is wack","Silkk might want to consider playing basketball if the continues to make CD's like this. Charge it 2 da game was good , but this is hoorible. The only two tight rappers on No Limit were C-Murder and Mac and they are both locked up. I suppose having guest artists like Trina and Snoop Dogg would make the album better, it does make it better but they can't save it. There are a few decent tracks here. The track with Krazy and C-Murder was good, and the track with Trina was cool too. The problem is, Silkk can't rap. Maybe Soulja Slim will have to lead the label. P and Silkk are not doing too well."
2,he has not matured as an artist,"After seeing Silkk on 106 and park talking about how he had matured since Made Man, I thought this CD would be philosophical and superior to Made Man. I was wrong, this CD is commercial and offers nothing new. Master P has no creativity and can't rap. ...All in all this CD is quite average and has nothing new to offer. If you really like Silkk, get his first release The Shocker."
3,3.5 Stars!,"Good album, a gang of guest appearances! Nice beats, some songs got some hard flows...get this! Good CD, very underrated!"

2,Book of Dream By Sylvia Brown,"I ordered three of her books How to contact you Spirit Guide, Life on the Other Side and her book of dreams. The first two were terrific, but the book of dreams is difficult to understand. However, I'm trying to understand. Sylvia is a great Author, who can keep you captivated. I would really like to meet her and learn more about her.M.G.Ebner"
2,Sylvia Browne's Book Of Dreams,"I was disappointed in the book because too much was relied upon letters written to her. I would have liked more of her own imput. Maybe I just didn't understand it, I don't know."
3,Could Be More Detailed,"I was disappointed in this book, really. It's full of stories of other people's dreams and I don't really like that. I like dream books that give the subjects and the meanings, no stories of other people because that doesn't really help ME. I don't think I'd buy this again, really to be honest. Oh well, I still adore Sylvia!!"
5,anatomy of a dream,"If your looking for a guide to help you understand and interpret your dreams, this book is excellent! With the knowledge and awareness attained in this book you open yourself to having more fruitful experiences when you dream.this book helped me solve many of my own dream realm puzzles"
1,"Save your money for your real ""dreams""","Ms. Browne seems to be well meaning when describing her experiences and her dreams and those of others. However, the books spends more time discussing Ms. Browne's views about herself rather than focusing on the more interesting information about dreams themselves.It is obvious from reading the book that Ms. Browne is a lay person and a ""spiritual guide"", not a scientist of any kind. I would venture to guess that most of the information she provides is based on her own opinions and conjecture rather than hard, sounds facts.I was very disappointed with this book, and only ""dream"" of getting my money back . . ."
5,Dreams,Sylvia is talented and can help with dreams. She has helped a lot of people in life. suggestive Recommending: = The Discovery of Dreams A-Z.
5,Very helpful for parents,The best thing about this book is the practical advice she provides about helping children deal with and eliminate nightmares. Her insights into protecting children from needless violent images are excellent. I can't say it strongly enough she provides sensible suggestions that if implemented would benefit generations of children.
4,A New Perspective on Dream Analysis,"While most dream books focus on the symbolism within the dreams, Sylvia focuses more on the different types of dreams, offering a fresh perspective on dream analysis. According to Ms. Browne, there are five different types of dreams. Release, Wish, Information, Prophetic, and Astral Travel. Within each section, she not only explains what the category means, but also provides examples for them. One of the last chapters of the book contains examples of various dreams submitted by readers, some a combination of two or more categories.While there are tons of books on dream symbolism, this is the first book I've come across that actually helps you to categorize the dream. Since dreams are mostly symbolic in nature and very personal, thereby, a bit cryptic, being able to categorize the dream first is a BIG help in deciphering it.I strongly recommend this book as part of further studies in dream analysis, including Carl Jung's 'Man and His Symbols'"
4,ONE MAJOR Problem!,"THIS Film IS rated - even though the amazon description above says it is not...and it is definetly R! I bought this, thinking mild sex and fart jokes (ala Kung Pow humor) but was surprised to find so many obscenities and overt sexual references. I'm not a prude, but I'd hoped to share this with my preteens...NO WAY! It IS hilarious, however, so if you don't have young kids around, ENJOY!"
4,The outbreak series is really worth getting...,"Resident evil: outbreak file 1 and 2 are amazing online games to buy. The only problem is that if you don't have PS2 online you shouldn't even bother renting this series, not to mention buying it. Outbreak one and two are only to be taken seriously if the consumer has online and really wants to have fun, get scared, and possibly win scenarios with help from other people. So many things can go wrong in each scenario, leaving people to have to save eachother, rather then caring only about themselves. This series has amazing enemies to face and non-stop scares just waiting to be experienced. Playing at midnight on the weekends, in the dark, especially gives the game life.The only problem from my perspective is that the loading pages last so long, but w/e its just a game to pass the time. Definately a serious thought to buy this game if online is available."
1,This game Pretty much sucks,"I was very disappointed with this game. I love the Resident Evil series, but this one sucked. Your AI partners are not very intelligent, they run around and don't listen to you when you need them. Normal mode is actually more like a ""hard"" mode. You can't really pause the game as it is live and the monsters come get you anyway, even when your in your inventory screen. The online option has been disabled so you can't play with other people anymore.It was just a hassle to control three people simultaneously, two of which never listen anyway.The only good thing is the scenery and surroundings. Also I liked how zombies could run after you if they wanted, instead of always dragging themselves around. Other than that, I really did not like this game."
2,Boring!!!!!,"The new Resident Evil Outbreak is boring. I expected it to be action-packed, boy was I wrong. Every level has like 0-3 zombies. I RENTED THE GAME TO SHOOT ZOMBIES, NOT INFECTED ANIMALS. My advice, try it at a friends house or play a demo first."
4,Resident Evil: Outbreak File 2,I hesitated ordering File 2 but couldn't resist having another Resident Evil game for just $20. Over all it's a fun game to play. It's just that the dumb A.I. characters are a pain to deal with. Most of the time just keeping them alive is a full time job. With friends like that who needs enemies? However coming down the home stretch and completing the game is a good feeling.
4,"Good but, alittle complicated","Oh,my real name is Jordan R.Brown and yeah,I'm using my mom's account.Just letting you know.I'm a huge fan of Resident Evil movies and games.But,when I first played this game,it was good and then I got it.I'm not even afriad of Resident Evil monsters but,I like Resident Evil Outbreak better but,there are some things missing in file #2 but,i'm not sure but,overall it's good but,it's just missing some things and parts that are making any sence but,yeah i agree with with all of you.The puzzles are complicated but,I think ""UnderBelly and ""Despert Times"" are one of the most puzzles one because,it seems very frustrating and confusing and plus,they are some characters that you need for those chapters.But,I still think it's a good game but,I still like Resident Evil Outbreak better.Resident Evil is one of the best horror games I ever played.Resident Evil Rules!!"
2,A shame to the Resident Evil name,So much for hoping Capcom would have learned it's lesson from the first Outbreak game. Nothing was improved in this chapter. This game still has the same stupid A.I. and annoying real time window that made the first game horrible. Not to mention the characters' audio and text often times don't correlate. Zombies popping up at random times just helped to compound frustration levels. Probably most disappointing is the lack of suspense and creepy atmosphere that made many Resident Evil predecessors so great.
5,Awesome,"With multiple objectives, this game will keep you coming back to play again and again. First, find the way out. Second, search for secret items. Third, see how quickly the scenario can be completed. Fourth, do the first three objectives in one of the four difficulty levels.Some fans may find it a bit boring after Resident Evil 4 as this game has more of a classic Resident Evil feel. Also, even on the easier modes, this game is very challenging. It's not for the impatient or easily frustrated.I gave it five out of five for fun, overall play and another 5 for replay value. No Resident Evil collection is complete without this game."
3,They stand the test of time,"Nothing spectacular here, just the satisfaction of the dice lasting more than a year without fading and without the cord breaking and giving that special ""fuzzy dice"" feeling to my car!"
5,Challenging and Lifechanging,"Reverend Gainous presents a tremendous challenge to move beyond the medicraty of sideline Christianity by moving into a position of power and faith, which leads to ultimate victory that all believers can enjoy. His practical and personal experiences adds life to each phase of development in order to become the contenders that God expects for Christians to be. I salute this work and highly recommend it for it's excellence toward bringing believers into the reality of the personal sacrifices and price to be paid to truly enjoy God given victories. The athletic and military analagies allows the reader to relate to biblical and spiritual principles from a practical perspective."
5,Taking Charge of Your Life,Reverend Gainous offer us in his book more than strong inspirational quotes and passages...he offer us the clear roadmap in how to take charge of our affairs in life and became a true successful contender in the eyes of The Lord.
2,Easy install? I don't think so.,"I ordered the Dashmat under the premise that it was an easy install, being mechanically retarded this appealed to me....lol...I'm sure it would have been easier had the velcro that came with it actually stuck to the dash. I did what the instructions said, clean the dash thoroughly with a mild solution, NO Armoral, my dash hadn't seen Armoral in 10 years in fact. So after fighting, sweating, and swearing over the non-sticky velcro I found myself at the auto store looking for industrial strength velcro. After about 2 hours I had it installed."
3,14 of the reviews are probably from the same person!,"Based on the reviews I ordered this book only to notice that 14 of the first 19 reviews were written on August 6 thru the 9th. Give me a break! Looks like someone is trying to skew the results and has done so successfully.I should soon receive the book and I will then write an authentic review of the book. I am sorry I didn't notice this stacking of the deck before hand because I relied heavily on the reivews to help me decide which crown and trim book was the best.So, BEWARE!! These reviews are NOT reliable. I should have the book in hand this week and will then write a review shortly thereafter."
3,"Good information, not so easy to understand",It will take a lot of practice measuring and cutting before the information makes sense. It definitely will take your wood working to the next level
4,Good information,I thought it was very helpful for the odd situation. What was lacking was something for the 52 degree spring angle.
5,Crown Molding by Wayne Drake,"Wayne,I searched the web for some good info on crown molding. Your book is nothing short of fantastic. After making my own templates I felt confident enough for the real thing. Every cut was perfect. No gaps....WOW. Your tables combined with the ""Exact Angle Squares"" made for a most satisfying project. The only down side is my new ""Honey Do"" list. It just keeps growing and growing.ThanksBill"
1,save your money,"save your money. go to the library and read it there. spend five minutes and you have the miter angles you need- out of the whole book that is all I took away. If you want to buy a copy buy it at Home Depot- same price but, the book is in color with much better pictures and in more detail. I feel ripped off."
4,Monotype,"This book gives a thorough overview of Monotype printing. It starts out with materials needed, then goes on to talk about hand transfers, press transfers and doing monotypes in acrylic, watercolor, oil and printmaking inks. It covers mixed media and stencils, masks, etc. It has much practical/useful information in each section on both techniques and materials. There are examples of each type of work covered, athough I would have liked to see a larger ""gallery"" of work by different artist. A very good book if you are interested in monotypes."
1,I WANT MY ORIGINAL PICTURES!!!,"I mean, come on. The pictures in the original 1973 version of the book were beautiful, it was, like in many childrens' stories, half of the enjoyment. But no...buy the original somewhere else. They've just messed an otherwise great book up."
4,Alternate Universe,"The scenes in these stories lingered in my thoughts long after I put the book down. The most intriguing aspect was the contrast between the cold and detached environments where the characters interact and the sensuality that infuses everything. I enjoy visiting worlds beyond my own, and this book took me there."

3,Interesting book; poor reference.,"I've had my copy for at least 20 years. A few times a year I pass by, pick it up, and am fascinated by the great articles about interesting artifacts of speech and culture.Butevery time I try to look something up in it, I am absolutely guaranteed of not finding it. Perhaps this is an effect of searching from general to specific. Before going to Brewer I've usually gone to an unabridged dictionary and encyclopedia and perhaps a specialized dictionary. Only after trying everywhere else do I try Brewer and don't find it there. Can't figure out how to USE it."
3,Item works,The product quality is fine and durable. For you golfers it should work.Watch out for their shipping cost---very high. A mistake i cleary made and accept. And they're touchy on reviews.
5,Futuro Support,"this product was shipped promptly and is of good quality. it helps relieve the pain of tendinitis in the forearm but most importantly, when worn, it is a constant reminder to take it easy. pains often come on quickly but healing requires time."
5,Thank Goodness!,"Thank goodness I bought these. I have tennis elbow in both elbows because of my career. (Flower design.) I have been suffering for quite awhile and I just got these braces and put them on and I can immediately feel a difference. My fiance better watch out, I can already tell this will help my bowling! A great relief for a great price!"
4,Works pretty well.,"I'm experiencing classic tennis elbow, from too much bad technique with the backhand, and playing a guy who hits the ball with a lot of pace and deep into my backhand corner. The elbow support works pretty well. Stays in place w' the velcro strap. Only thing I'd suggest as improvement is a somewhat larger, higher area that pushes down on the forearm muscle and tendon. Overall, it works well."
3,not that comfortable,"I ordered this tennis elbow support as well as one by Mueller (Tennis Elbow Support, Black, One Size) from Amazon. I found this one, the Futuro, to be uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. I found the edges scratchy. The pad that goes over the affected area is somewhat crinkled and left marks on my arm after taking it off. The Mueller tennis elbow support is much more comfortable. I can wear it for hours. It too leaves some marks/indentations, but,oddly, is not uncomfortable to wear. I try and take the support off whenever I can and give my arm time to breathe and for the marks to go away, massaging that area of the arm. I tend to leave it off when I know I'm not going to lifting anything or in any way stressing that area-at home, sleeping, etc."
5,rmcfurball,"I like this elbow support very much. I am wearing it right now and have had it on all day. It is very comfortable. It is so hard to find the right support, that I was so glad that I found it on Amazon.com. I have had a nerve problem for many years and have had to wear a support just about every day. If I don't I have major pain down my arm and into my fingers. This support does what it is intended to do."
2,Not good with long sleeves - doesn't stay in the right place,"Futuro makes another version that is like a compression sleeve that extends above and below the elbow and has two forearm pressure points. I find it to be much easier to use. This one goes on fine, then slides down frequently. If I try pulling my sleeve up and adjusting it, it slides down again when I try to get the sleeve back down over it. If you might be using this while wearing long sleeves, or you don't want to have to make adjustments throughout the day, I recommend checking out the other version that just says ""Elbow"" and not this sport version."
4,Elbow Brace,The Futuro Tennis Elbow Support is a good value. The product is durable and provides good support. One unexpected problem was the width of the product. For Tennis it works well. For lifting and carrying things the thickness prevents full flexion of the elbow and causes irritation by rubbing.
4,Beginnings of Miles' Best Band,"Though this cd cannot live up to the awesome power of Pangaea or Agharta it still is a powerful cd. This is heavy music powered not only by jazz funk but by an otherworldliness that only Miles Davis could create. This is heavily influential on anyone from DJ Spooky to Tortoise. As for the album itself, Dave Liebman can't compare to Sonny Fortune as a saxophonist and the sound is a little iffy but hey this is 70's Miles and that said you can't go wrong."
4,Early Miles funk collective,"This concert was recorded not too long after Pete Cosey joined the band and the material took a distinctly funk direction rather than the jazz-rock that proceeded the On the Corner album.The band comes out swinging with Turnaroundphrase, which sounds closer to James Brown than other versions I have heard, though the sound is marred for a few minutes the bass and drums lock in around a swirling pool of funk. The second song I believe, is Tune in 5 with great funk guitar intro and Miles spacey trumpet, moving towards Ife with it's heart beat bass, brilliant guitar soloing, and percussion."
5,"Amazing, supportive, comfortable, and awesome boots.","Honestly, I rely heavily on reviews, which is why I must comment on these. They are awesome! I have never bought a pair of boots at this price that are so comfortable. I love them. I typically wear Vasque hiking boots or Montrails, but I did not want to spend over seventy-five dollars on boots. After all, they are just going to get muddy and trashed, right?These fit the bill, and they are plenty good for hiking. I cannot comment on the waterproof capabilities because I do not plan on using them when it is wet. I just don't want to chance ruining these. Although, they are very well made boots and I highly recommend them if you do not want to spend too much money on hiking boots. Save your money and buy these if they are still priced fairly (under sixty-five dollars). Don't go after those one hundred dollar or more pairs of boots. It is simply just wasting your money. These work as well as any hiking boots that I have ever worn for walking."
4,"It's vitamin, but...","Jarrow is a solid company that has tested well in independent labs. And it's just B5, so overall I give this 4 stars. However, I took off a star because I bought it for my wife for some acne issues. Has not helped at all. Not to say for others it won't, but for her it did not."
2,Upgrade to Professional version!,"These Microplane graters are wonderful, but I recommend the Professional versions instead. If you use your graters a lot, the plastic edges will eventually break, so spend the extra few dollars and get the steel edged Professional versions to start with. I just replaced two graters myself because they broke."
2,I agree with upgrading to Pro series,"Excellent grating surface. Plastic frame and handle came loose within a few months, then the plastic frame just came apart within a year.I'll be going pro."
5,Indispensable,"I now have all three grades, and find them indispensable! After I purchased this, I read the home vs professional style, and have to say that I don't have a problem with the home series."
4,Excellent for quick grating of hard items,"This is another high quality item from microplane. I use this regularly. Its quick and easy to pull out and grate some cheese. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because this does a great job grating hard cheeses like parmesan, but is not a good choice for grating softer cheeses like mozarella. For softer items, I use a small rotary shredder by zyliss."
2,His later releases are much better,"Kirk Whalum is one of my favorites, but this CD jeopardizes his current releases. The recordings sound like they were performed in a garage, not a studio, and the background instruments sound digitally created like that from a Casio keyboard.Don't waste money on this one.His release ""Unconditional"" is incredible! Spend your money there!"
3,Whalum's Best Yet to Come,"While I listen to a great deal of jazz and smooth jazz, I find that the best listening in this CD is the stuff that leads him back to his gospel roots in the Gospel According to Jazz CD's that follow. This is an interesting collection that left me less than awe struck for some reason. I like Kirk's ideas and melodies, but his solo work is reserved and processed---more like what you would expect from a musician playing for juries or in a master class in front of his peers (college music majors should relate to this kind of starchy playing). It is accurate but lacks the depth of a Michael Brecker, Mark Colby or Dave Sanborn. Still, I would rather listen to this CD collection than a million Kenny G albums.I am glad I own it, but wouldn't want to hear the rest of the albums that accompany each selection if this is the best."
5,Good Product and Excellent Service,Vendor provide prompt response ; take care and fix the problem right away. You couldn't ask anything more.
3,Bosch vacuum bags/Bosch vacuum needing bags,"It turns out Bosch makes both vacuums that need bags and vacuums that don't. The bags are very expensive, so it makes sense to buy the vacuum that doesn't require this constant, expensive purchase."
3,Bosch????,"This brush did not ship directly from Amazon, but from GoVacuum. Nowhere on the brush is the name Bosch, and though it was supposed to be for my Bosch model, the Compact Plus Health Guard, I suspect it was not even made by Bosch. It is MUCH darker in color than pictured and MUCH darker than my other attachments. The clip by the connection end which is supposed to be used to clip on to the canister is much more difficult to use than the one on the original brush and even when it engages, the wand isn't steady. The vacuum does work though, with the brush attached and that is the most important feature."
3,A nice read,"The book is a nice read, it has an enjoyable read and some curiosities. Unfortunately it do not look deeper into the subject."
5,Anybody thats in the marial art should buy and read this book.,I have been in the martial arts for a long time and I always recommendstudents and parents of students to read this book.It so happens the Master Peter Urban was my SENSEI back in the 60's.There has been a lot of SENSEI'S but nothing like Master Peter Urban.
1,Strong??? Nope... this one just doesn't cut it,"This tool attracted me at first because of the concave shape of the jaws. My current cable cutter is a basic straight edge cutter, and it does the job well, but sometimes the cables slip out of the jaw since the blades are straight. So, with this curved jaw, I was pretty excited (as one can be for a hand tool).My tool arrived today and I decided to test the cable cutter out on a piece of shielded 1/8"" stranded wire. First attempt, EPIC FAIL!!! It cut through the plastic sheath and only one piece of the wire strand was actually cut through, the rest, just bent at the point of contact.What's worse? The blade on the bottom jaw got chipped. Very disappointed in this tool, when my generic wire/cable cutter can do the job at half the price. Tool looks well designed and strong, but the blade edge is way too thin and fragile. This tool is being sent back to Amazon..."
2,have to use two hands,"you have to use two hands, because the jaws do not open far enough to get the wire in it."
2,Poor cutting quality,"These cable cutters are just about worthless. I purchased them to trim bicycle cable shielding and cables. They barely do either of these, when trying to cut shielding it simply folds the cable in half and then jams. I have tried different holding positions and placement of the shielding in the cutter, with simply no different results. They will cut the cables themselves if you get the placement perfect. They have chipped already and will probably only be used in situations where I don't care about having a clean cut."
1,Simplistic and one sided,"This is war as seen from the Allies side, with hardly any references or researches on the Central Powers. Hardly impartial historical writing. And boring too."
3,Fine For Extra Dress Shirts,"I have ordered approximately 11 shirts (6 White, 4 blue , and yes a pink)and this purchase was a repeat - so I did have the opportunity to try ""them"" out before buying again.Pros:*Low cost*Looks fine under a suit jacket*Great to have extra dress white and blues that you don't need to worry about ""destroying""*Machine wash*Not as bad as some other low end shirts that cost 9.99 - 14.99*I have gotten over a dozen + uses from the shirts with out any problems (works out to several cents a wear -since I machine wash & iron them myself)Cons:*Thin cotton fabric - these are not definitely not Brook Brothers*If you Machine wash (most regular settings)- you will need to iron*You will properly - No! Most likely need to wear a t beneath since the material is thin"
2,Average Shirts,"Shirts of average quality...worth about what I paid for them, $10.00.....built in collar stays..."
5,Excellent shirts!!!,Two co-workers and I ordered these shirts. We are all extremely satisfied with them. These shirts are an excellent value. We would recommend them highly to all our friends and colleagues.
2,Not my taste,"I did not like the texture/material. The fitting was also loose for me. Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts, these shirts were disappointment."
1,The Dark Side of Bill Blass,"Pros:I bought this shirt before it changed to $10 a pop.Has magical powers.I wore this shirt on Superbowl Sunday and the Steelers won.Cons:I put the shirt on and chaos erupted, i.e., it is flammable."
1,Cheap Stuff,Not of Good quality.It's not even worth for that price.Packaging is also not good.The pictures are misleading and they do not look like that.
1,I didn't know Amazon handled such poor quality anything!,"My shirts arrived today.Thin, ...an understatement!I've seen support hose that was thicker!It would take three of these shirts to to make one good shirt.Good for summer wear someone said. These shirts are the kind that are so thin they would cling to you!I'll need nipple patches on about the third wearing. You know, like the knee patches we used to use on blue jeans.Looks like Bill Blass has gone the way of other companies, selling off their name. I wouldn't even rip them up for cleaning cloth.NO THANKS! Back they go! I'll suffer the shipping."
1,not worth it,"do not buy these shirts, not worth the money, certainly not worth bill blass label, very poor style and stitching and fabric."
2,Price of < $10 is good but the shirts are thin..,"Though good workmanship, I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name."
1,What you see is not what you get,I bought two shirts and later I realize never ever buy cloths over net. What you see is not what you get. These are poor quality shirts.
2,Not Impressed,The material is almost see-through and the collar stays are sown into the material. Not really the highest quality although what can you expect for the price?
3,Bill Blass.....really?,"If this is what I should expect from Bill Blass, I'll stick with Arrow. It was very thin and wrinkles easily."
1,save your $; buy better quality,"like the birdies sing...cheep cheep...yep they are cheapi got the izzue (sp) shirt and it was great...these blass ones, not so great...plus amazon plays the price game, they were 5 bucks, but then came a special promo, they raised the price to 7.50...to get you to buy more; using the promo code bringing the price back to 5 each, gamesmanship....gotta really watch amazon prices, always double check at other sites...like the contek sunglasses, amazon had them at 130 retail....heck the mfr only had them retail at 80...games"
4,great!,"i wasn't expecting much at first but this is actually top quality in any standards. First i bought one to make sure the size fits and then i bought more, many more."
2,Barely worth what I paid for it,"I bought these shirts for $6 each thinking that I've got a bargain, but once I received them was disappointed in my purchase. As previous reviewers mentioned, the material is flimsy, 60% cotton - 40% polyester (and feel like the latter), the fit is improper and finish poor. Am wearing one of the shirts now, and it wears uncomfortably (feels like a poorly made medical scrub) and looks just as cheap (yes, even the French Blue color). Will either send these back or they will end up collecting dust in my closet."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this shirt for one reason, the price, and I soon as I open the box I found out why it was so cheap. Because of the cheap materials. Save your money, spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality."
1,Don't be cheated,"I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews. Dont mean to be rude, but people who gave these shirts probably haven't wore a decent dress shirt. You can frequently get 'good' $45 shirt for $10 in malls when on sale. I thought this was a better deal. But boy oh boy, I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store. I had ordered these as a gift, but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion, or even for daily use (except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something). These are from Bangladesh, and I can assure you, they are not much better than what would be sold for $0.50 in BGD. If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere, DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS."
1,Not a bargain anymore,"The negatives were as reviewed: thin, square cut, and ugly packaging. At $7.50 they were acceptable for the cheap price. At $9.99, they are no bargain!"
4,Totally disagree-GOOD SHIRTS,"These are very good shirts, especially when you consider the excellent low cost. I have about 8 of these and have washed and dried 4 of them at least 15 times. Shirt looks EXCELLENT and I am very happy with them.Collars still look flat and smooth.I certainly recommend them.Is it the best shirt I've ever owned.....surely not, but it is a good product in good colors."
5,The shirt that killed my dog and made my wife leave...,"First, a horrifying coincidence happened when the UPS man dropped the package containing my Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar onto my doorstep just as The General, my wife's wiener dog, was exiting through his doggy door . The weight of this seemingly light package crushed The General's aft legs on impact as he went for his morning tinkle. The General gimped back into the house, without tinkling, limping and screeching. Since my wife was gone, and I had recently seen a program on the Discovery Channel about amputation, I decided to take it upon myself to help The General out of his misery. As I was cutting off his hind legs, my wife came home. End of story. Apart from that, it's a lovely shirt, and I'd recommend it to anyone! Good luck."
1,This Sucks,I waited all week for this over priced shirt. I only bought it because I couldn't find another button down shirt in eggplant and I needed the color for an event this week. The shirt arrived and they sent me the wrong style shirt. Its a polo shirt. Doesn't even look like the picture. Now I'm screwed for the event this week. Hella Lame.
5,Cute and functional!,Ordered this as a gift for a friend and they absolutely love it! Its very durable and just plain fun to serve out of.
2,smack the editors,"As mentioned by other reviewers, this DVD is just horrible to watch because of the absurd amount that the cameras cut away to another scene every few seconds. If you want to watch a guitar solo or anything else for that matter to absorb any details, forget it! The editor(s) didn't do the Scorpions justice. The music is good, but since this is a DVD and not a CD, I'm giving two stars for the spazoid video technique."
3,"Nice historical document for Scorpions Fans, but...","I'm not a Mathias fan, so I won't comment on that. It was nice to see the Scorpions w/ some faces from the past. Uli was on as usual, but I felt bad that Michael seemed so unrehearsed & uninspired. If you're looking for Michael to blaze some Scorpions songs, you might be disappointed...A couple things to add after owning this for a while:1. Yes, the video editor should be shot...2. The tunes are a bit rushed. The Scorp's have a bad habit of that...3. The sound has that loud broadcast mastering sound to it, where everything is always loud. No dynamics...Kind of a disappointment overall..."
5,Outstanding,"This is would have to be without doubt one of the best live concerts on DVD. Buy it, put it on and turn it up full blast. You won't be disappointed, I assure you."
3,Not Pleasantly Surprised,"I've loved the Scorps for just about as long as they've been a band and couldn't wait to see this DVD.The music is fantastic, but as is written on other reviews, the production is amateur. The camera changes every 3-4 seconds so you never get to focus on anything. That would have been a cool effect every so often but not through the whole thing. The sound is not so great in places. On Coast to Coast, you can barely hear the lead guitar in places which is what makes that song so great, especially for a simple instrumental.I wish they could take their footage and soundtrack and remix it better. This could have / should have been a much higher quality production.But still, it's the Scorps and I'll watch it a thousand times!"
5,Another brilliant performance by the Scorpions,"I just watched this DVD for the first time,and what a show! The Scorpions prove again that they are the BEST LIVE BAND EVER! I have been saying that for 30 years now and this DVD proves it again. The band is awesome. And with guests Uli Jon Roth,Micheal Schenker, and Herman Rarebell this is truly a must have for any Scorpions fan.It was shot during the tour for the Unbreakable album,and the track list covers all era's of the band's extensive record catalog.From Speedy's Coming and Pictured Life to Love 'Em or Leave 'Em.This show ROCKS! Crank up the surround sound and enjoy!"
1,"Pathetic video, makes you blind","I don't understand why the editors needed to cut the best songs from the show. I also don't understand why the felt the need to change the camera angle EVERY FIVE SECONDS. This makes for a decent cd, watching the video is hazardous to your brain. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL."
3,"NEEDED BETTER EDITING, BUT OVERALL GREAT DVD.","GREAT DVD, BUT COULD HAVE USED BETTER EDITING. SOUND COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR SUCH A GOOD CONCERT. GOOD LIST OF SONGS."
1,OMG I am having terrible Iron Maiden flashbacks,"Just when I thought it could get any worse than Iron Maiden's Rock in Rio or Dance of Death tour dvds, the Scorpions appeared to have hired the same camera, film and editing crew of those aforementioned releases. A great performance no doubt but the editing makes this unwatchable. Just an overpriced dvd to play when the tube is turned off."
1,Scorpions Live at Wacken open air 2006,"Be careful. Had to return. Did not play on my DVD player or computer. The back cover said NTSC Region 0. However, the DVD said PAL Region 9. I could see the picture, but there was no sound. Wait for the US version!!"
5,An excellent instructional Video.,"Killy only does the inro and trailer section. Jens Husted and Chris Ryman skiing together,as in their Black Diamond video, do the demonstrations. Sybervison presents the skiers perfect turns from all angles, in slow motion and reverse photography so the viewer can see how all body parts work together in linking short and medium radius turns on moderate, steep, mogul and powder conditions. The Killy and Black Diamod tapes are both excellent. The music is great as well. Even though the tape was made 15 years ago the form is timeless. Watch this video several times a week during the ski season to implant the image of perfect turns in your head. Ski and watch again. You will improve. Add to this video Ellen Post Fosters Skiing and the Art of carving which describes the subtle differences with the new shaped Skis and your collection of training videos will be complete."
3,"Audio/Video Quality F-, Skiing Technique A","This film has instructional value if the viewer understands the basic mechanics of alpine skiing. Especially, one must understand when to flatten and when to edge a ski. Without that specific knowledge, this video is inspiring but it won't help a beginner or intermediate skier improve.My complaints: It's one of the poorest reproductions I've ever seen. In order to get the picture to stop rolling and the sound to clear so that the music was audible, I needed to turn-off all of the VCR's high tech features. I also think that a copy was used to make a copy of a copy, etc., etc., etc. The tape was reproduced at extended play speed, or maybe extended, extended, super extended play speed. I didn't measure it, but I would not be surprised if there are only 30 feet of tape on the roll. I would think that it could have been reproduced at standard speed since tape is cheap.Based on audio-video quality, this tape is a rip-off. Based on skiing mechanics it's a keeper."
4,Another concept album,"The name ""New Triumvirat"" was the result of legal action taken by former members Dick Frangenberg and Hans Bathelt, who left the band after ""Old Loves Die Hard"". Fritz and Barry Palmer recruited drummer Curt Cress (an amazing musician who played at the German jazz-rock outfit Passport) and bassist Dieter Petereit and recorded another concept album dealing with the Roman empire. ""Pompeei"" is not as good as ""Spartacus"", but still deserves careful listening today. Good music, good lyrics and (pardon me, Grand Funk!!), good singin', good playin'."
4,Book to stir the imagination,"I liked many things about this book. The author, Jules Verne, is very good at describing and harnessing the imagination of the reader. He made the story very interesting too. It's amazing, to me, how much of this fiction book is quite accurate. I didn't dislike much of the book except many times Verne got so descriptive that he stayed on the same subject for up to 5 pages. Which in turn tired me of the book. Other than that I enjoyed the book immensely. I'd recommend this book to everyone for hope that they will realize when this book was written and take into account how much imagination was put into it. If people only learn one thing from this book, it should be to have an imagination"
5,the book is amazing!!!,i just like to say that it is worth 5stars and its worth reading more than once.it 's interesting!!!! kartik mahajan age 12
4,Great Story,"This book is pretty exciting from start to finish. If you have read other Verne and not this one, then it is highly recommended. The only beef I have is that Verne gets too descriptive with the fish in each sea. It almost becomes redundant and the picture for me always seems to look the same. A lot of action and its a lot of fun trying to figure out the mystery behind Captain Nemo."
3,The original adventure novel.,"If you like adventure books, struggle through this one. It's a must-read for anyone who enjoys the classics.I will admit there were some times when it dragged, and some times when it dragged quite a bit, especially when he endlessly described the flora and fauna of undersea life (you almost have to read ""The Origin of Species"" along with it) but it really was interesting."
1,great book / lousy ebook,downloaded the book and immediately started to suffer from kindle freeze. it completely locked up my kindle. took a lot of effort to get back in but as soon as i deleted the book kindle performance was back to normal. other reviews dont metion this problem so im mystified.
2,Not a good read,"I am sorry to say, but this book was without a doubt, one of the wrost books I have ever read in my life. The story dose have plot but that is about all the good things that go along with the story. I also did enjoy how Verne made up basic human needs from using marine and plant life from the sea. The last thing that was good, was when the crew of the Natulius had to fight the giant squid, they are called something else in the book, but I didn't pay attention. Those are the ONLY good factors about this book. The author spends more time on description of the water than the action of the book. I found that very dull and boring. When I first read the book, I had heard great things about it, but when I read the book, I was very disspointed. Take my advise, don't read the book."
4,Interesting,"After watching the Disney movie 20,000 Leagues, I wanted to read the real story to see what else it had to tell. It was a very good read, long, but good."
4,Good book,It was really good. And I think if u like Jules Verne's stories you should read twenty thousand leagues under the sea
5,Five Stars For Verne!!,"Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, is a great book packed with adventure and suspense. In 1866, there is a mission to kill a giant cetacean out at sea. A group of men go out to kill the strange creature, which turns out to be something unexpected. The men are taken prisoners of the strange creature and have to find a way to escape! Jule Verne was a great author born in Naotes, France in 1828. He always was fascinated by science, which inspired him to write about submarines, television, atomic bombs, and automobiles even before they were invented! Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is fantastic!! Read it!!!!!"
3,Shows its age,"Unfortunately, ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" shows its age. While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic. This is one of the few cases where a movie has an advantage over the written word."
5,A Great read,This book was an amazing book that I could not put down after I started reading it. If you like adventure and a little bit of fictional history you will love this book. In Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea there are lots of great adventure scenes. I also like how Jules Verne describes everything in such detail. I would definitely recommend this book.
4,Kindle book - very smart &easy transfer-- excellent book to possess.,The book in e-transfer format for Kindle is very fast and hassle free. The book is in very good condition and the contents are excellent to read. Worth possessing. ---thanks
5,Loved it!,"I want to read it again! This is a awesome book. I like this better than Journey to the Center of the Earth. It's a little long but its worth the time it takes to read it. An exciting journey is waiting for you with in the pages of the wonderful classic book. My fave parts are when they; visit Atlantis, go hunting underwater, and go pearl diving. However, I still want to know more about Captain Nemo. The book didn't answer all my questions about him. God bless ya."
3,"Great Story, Bad Typing","It's a great story, no question. However, this version is riddled with typographical errors, that I found very distracting. I'll think twice about getting another free book from this publisher."
1,3 men who are in a sub and tour the world.,This book was VERY BAD. I HATED it. It is a big book with lots of words. Take my advice and STAY AWAY. I would give this book 0 stars but the minimum they let is 1.
1,A clas-sick that made me sick,This book was very boring. very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between. The beginning of the book is the best part. It spent too much time explaining and describing images; i felt like the whole book could be cut in half and you would still get the majority of the story across to the readers
1,Never received,I never received this item. The seller sent this item to my shipping address at my billing address. 2 different addresses as we do not receive mail at our house.
4,Classic!,Literary classic that I am glad that I read. I just wish I read it years ago. I will have to go back to my childhood home to see if I can find the book I had when I was a child.
3,dated,The descriptions and names of animals are dated. The ideas expressed are as well. It was interesting to see how some of the technical details held up.Overall a bit dull at times with rather long descriptions typical of books written during this period. Would do better with a bit of editing for content and updating of language.
4,Pleasant,I enjoyed the book thoroughly and never seemed to be amazed by the incredible imagination portrayed by the author and how eerily accurate we now know him to have been
3,An Underwater Adventure,"There's a world deep in the ocean you have to see to believe, and Jules Verne takes you to it. I got disinterested in Verne's overt detailed descriptions of the sea life. Otherwise, it was a fascinated read."
4,Good choice,"A classic is a classic, but additional features in this edition make it a great choice. Nice illustrations, too!"
2,"Great story, nice binding, difficult translation","The hardcover version of the Sterling edition is bound and printed nicely. Jules Verne's story is enthralling and full of detail. However, the translation in the Sterling edition is very old and can be rather tongue-twisting when read aloud. The word ordering in the sentences often reflects the original French a bit too much. Likewise, the numereous names of various flora and fauna are rendered in Latin form, rather than the more common names I'm familiar with. I've found Frederick Paul Walter's newer (and also unabridged) translation to be much easier to read:Amazing Journeys: Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Circling the Moon, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and Around the World in 80 Days."
2,Too Long and Dull,"This book started off ok. I mean there was a good intro but after that nothing seemed to happen. Dont get me wrong, there were like two scenes of action but they were really short and lasted maybee a page. And it was a long book so there were huge spaces in the book where nothing happened."
1,It was so boring.,"Do not buy this book. It is a waste of your money. If you buy this book ,it will sit somewhere and never go to use ,even if you just read the first 2 pages you will be disgusted."
3,"20,000 Leagues....","I had to read this book for a Summer Reading Project, and I felt that this book was very advanced. By saying advanced, I mean that Verne was very modern in his thinking and ideas, being that this book was written quite a while ago. I think that it's a good book for everyone to read. It's a fast read, too."
5,Lots of thumbs up!,"20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA is a great book by Jules Verne. It is about a ship that gets attacked by a giant sea monster. Professor Aronnay sets off in his steel plated submarine to find the monster. Captain Nemo is near, and agrees to to go into a new world. He doesn't expect a sea monster, though! Lots of action in this book - blowing things up, great escapes, and. . . you can find out the rest for yourself!"
1,An Obsolete Translation,"This paperback, one of the Barnes and Noble ""Classics Editions"" is a republication of the original English translation by Rev. Lewis Page Mercier made in 1872. Mercier's translation leaves out 20% of the book and makes numerous other textual errors. These facts have been known for fifty years. The editor is a Victoria Blake, not otherwise identified, who in fact recommends in the Appendix that for further reading one might consult the complete novel as translated by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter and published by the Naval Institute Press in 1993."
3,"Nothing bad about the book, but I can't recommend it...","My problem with the book is that it is boring or at least it goes into too much detail here and there. I'm referring to the endless descriptions of water, molluscs, sea creatures, vegatation, and so on. Now if you're one of the few sea-faring persons - one who loves the sea and loves sailing or boating or whatever, then you will enjoy the book. I did enjoy all the action scenes and any scenes that had dialogue or interaction between Nemo and the Professor. There was just so much detail that I practically skimmed through those pages. I feel bad that I did not have interest in these subjects, but it was just too much and after some point, not very interesting."
4,Amazing undersea adventure!,"Only four stars because of the amount of skimming I had to do because of the massive quantity of scientific nomenclature for the fish and other creatures encountered. Beyond that, this book is an amazing adventure story with triumphs and dangers that make you feel the atmosphere of almost every scene! It makes the movie seem mundane."
4,"Great book, in a great size!!","I love Jules Verne's writing. This book is small enough to fit in a purse or glove box so you can take it with you anywhere. If you like steampunk fiction, or old west, read some Jules Verne"
5,I love this book!,I LOVE this book!!!<3I gave this rating because this book is awesome!! Also because I could imagine the book in my head
4,Miss. Muhls 6th grade class Jack,"In this book there are three main characters,Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, and Captain Nemo. The book Twenty thousand Leagues Under the Sea was veryinteresting. It is very suspensful and you are always thinkingthat the characters are going to die. Their are mant differentsurvival scenes. For example one scene captain Nemo sees anindian gets attacked by a shark so he he jumps in the water and tackels the shark. He almost gets killed but Ned Land throws hisharpoon and kills the shark.This book reminds me of the ocean because they are always traveling through the ocean in their submarine. This book is very exciting because they are always going on different adventures. The book makes me think about when I first road on a sailboat. In the beginning of this book they are sailing on a boat."
3,A very reader-friendly classic,"The classic undersea adventure doesn't disappoint. Full of mystery, both in terms of the unknown element of the seas, but in the behavior of cagey Captain Nemo. Easily engaged, the reader will travel beneath the sea, visiting places of the imagination, and seeing phenomena that I hope a lucky few may have witnessed."
5,Great aid to the real story.,"We are reading the unabridged version to the kids and this is an indespensible aid for understanding the descriptive story. The pictures are great and very accurate to the descriptions. Historical notes put the story in context of when it was written (i.e. marvels at an electric engine, extant knowledge of sea life, predictions about underwater scuba gear). The kids can follow along in this while I read and the text is very close. I heartily recommend it as a reading aid."
5,Challenging but beautiful.,"The original story is lush with great vocabulary and detailed description, a little work, but well worth it. I'm reading it aloud to my 10, 9, and 6 year olds. The DK illustrated abridgement is a good supplement too."
4,Great Story,"It's amazing to consider how prescient this book was, in its descriptions of submarine travel. The extensive descriptions of oceanic life border, at times, on tedious, but must have been novel and more exciting to the original audience. The main shortcoming of the book is that very little explanation is given of Captain Nemo's background or motivation until the last few chapters, and even then only a hint and a shadow of explanation are given.This is apparently not the best English translation, but it was not too difficult."
2,Twenty Thousand,"I really disliked this book. I think some of it has to do with the fact that the lines were off on some of the sentences throughout the book which made it more difficult. This is a great story, very imaginative but painful to get through unless you are a marine biologist."
4,Twenty thousand leagues under the sea,Twenty thousand leagues under the sea. I found it a fascinating and wonderful piece of science fiction. It was difficult to put down
5,"Dated, but a great read","Sure the language has changed since it was written, and it was translated from French. But the ideas hold up great, the plot is cool, and the characters are entertaining. A great read, entertaining to see what J.V. predicted correctly and what was totally off. The introduction was pretty cr*ppy. It tried to make J.V. seem like a futurist without peer. One example - he predicted the escape velocity of a rocket. I believe an Italian dude figured that out in the 1600's.Want to read a good classic? This is it. Need to discover a tried and true sci-fi original? Ditto."
1,Horrible narration,The narrator should have a European (french) accent. Instead he has a gravely American accent. It just does not fit the story at all. I was not happy with this purchase.
3,Justins review,I think this is a well written novel. Jules Verne is an exelent writter. I rated this bool at a 3 because I dont like to read but it was worth it so if you dont mind 350 plus pages and enjoy science fiction then go get this book.
2,urk...,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't be so mean to a ""classic"", but I found this book quite insufferable. I suppose it's unfair to judge it my modern standards, but I will anyway. I found the policy of our heroes attempting to kill any animal they possibly could more than a little disturbing: when the book mentioned dolphins and sea otters the thought that flashed through my head was ""talking stag"". Not only that, but the book's bloody boring! It consists of many vague, unfocused, and quite unconnected episodes that never evoked any interest whatsoever. I would not have finished this book if I hadn't been reading it for a class. Geesh...Study question: Ned and Conseil: lovers?"
1,"I know this is classic literacy and what not, but I wiill never read this book again.","This book would only be good for a marine biologist or a latin translator because they are the only people who can translate it. The book might say something like, ""The Nautilus was attacked by a group of spodulini auarius."" You then are confused. A few chapters later, it might say how the Nautilus was attacked by some giant squid. Then everything clicks. The story was long and winding, and seemed like it would never end. I couldn't finish the book as it had begun them to seem torturous. Don't read it."
2,a trial to read,I can not describe how much I did not enjoy this book. It took me 5 months to read it for a reason and I consider 5 days a long time to read a book. So much description and no plot made this book feel like it was 1000 pages long. It just never got anywhere. I cared nothing about any of the characters and finished it only so I could say I did.
2,I did not like this book.,"The book 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was a really disapointing book. Most of the story was boring and not exciting. When it got interesting it just was not as good as other books. I thought this was going to be a good book. The end was the most disapointing part. I would not recommend this book for people my age."
2,Not all classics are great---obviously.,"I read this out loud to my three children when they were young, only one stayed around till the end. Mind-numbingly dull unless one reads it with a funny voice or reads it as a sad tale of the narrator's unrequited love for Captain Nemo."
3,classic,"The story was interesting. I found the descriptions of the fish and other sea creatures to be tedious to get through, but I persevered and finally finished."
2,This is a children's version of the original story,I was disappointed to find this was a children's version of the Jules Verne novel. Amazon's description of it doesn't make this clear.
4,boring at first but gets more exciting every sec,"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a great classic that everyone should read but give yourself plenty of time! It does take a while to let all the details soak in, details, details, details! There are plenty of them, so if you are a reader who doesn't quite understand every aspect of the book that you are reading pick up 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and have no fear! Get someone to read it with you so they can share the exciting and wonderful world of the ocean and all its parts in the eyes of Jules Verne. No one should go through life having never reading this wonderful classic by Jules Verne. His descriptive talents are absolutely wonderful and explain every subject in the book. I recommend this book to anyone in need of an adventure for the mind. Enjoy!"
2,A disappointing read for the 21st century,"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days. But I found it a rather boring and drudging read."
4,Under the Sea,"This is Jules Verne's most famous novel, and it still holds up pretty well. It has a slower, more deliberate pace than today's readers are probably used to, but it is still a good read. I don't think I need to say much about it, because the story is pretty well known. But I will say that Captain Nemo is a very intiguing character, and people interested in Victorian Era fiction should definitely get this book."
3,"That book's really interesting, but it needs more adventure","The begining of this book, really attracts and I read it excited thinking that the rest would be interesting, but as it continued I really was getting bored, so I just read the last part and quited reading it. I think it's so famous just because of Verne's fantasy on making tha NAUTILUS."
3,Shows Its Age,"Unfortunately, ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" shows its age. While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic. This is one of the few cases where a movie has an advantage over the written word."
3,"Dry, but good Read","It is a good book, but overall, felt like half the time he was overly descriptive and made it DRY, got 70% done and tried to finish it, but had to come back to it... Felt as though the Prof does want to stay but the other part of him wants to leave, half the time is spend describing things, or fish, or coordinates, and history, it is a very descriptive book, but it does get very dry at times as you want to just move to the next page to stop reading the over drawn descriptions"
3,Hasn't quite stood up to the test of time,"So, nearly 150 years have passed since this book has been published... and much of it has become just boring. I'm sure back then the description of how under-sea boats and suits work was thrilling, but now it's kind of... yup, I know that.He goes into deep detail about the marine life, many a time, and I just skimmed and skimmed and skimmed. Honestly, by the end of the book I just wanted it to be over with. It could possibly make a 4-star movie with the right effects today."
3,An underwater adventure,"When you consider that Mr. vernes wrote this undersea adventure about a submarine, when steam engines were the rage. And underwater boat was unheard of. By todays standards the book is not very exciting, but for its time it is very adventerous. The endless cataloging of the undersea life and the operation of the submarine all come out of the autor's head. There is one thing to note that I first read this book in grammer school and just re-read it. It is a shame that what was once considered a childrens book, has vocabulary that most of the Worlds High School students can not understand."
4,"111,120 KM Under the Ocean","Confusing Title: My husband and I were talking the other night about the Jules Verne novel 20,000 Under the Sea and we both admited to having been confused by the title at one time. 20,000 leagues (60,000 miles or 111,120 kilometers) is 8.5 thousand times deeper than the deepest point on the ocean. 20,000 leagues is the distance the two men traveled on the Nautilus.Obsession Worse than Nemo: I remember in 6th grade a group of boys did a huge series of blue prints for the Nautilus based on the book. I thought it was a waste of time back then and still do but apparently lots of folks don't. The blue prints of the Nautilus feature in Clive Cussler's book Valhalla Rising. And there's an entire website devoted to blue prints and 3D models.Closing thoughts: I much prefer the sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. If you get a chance, read The Mysterious Island."
4,A Poetic Masterpiece,"Jules Verne is one of the most captivating and poetic writers ever in existence. All of his novels are complete masterpieces, but this novel is the best one I have ever read. Its intricate plot line and complicated writing style make the novel seem both romantic and adventerous. Although for some the writing style may be too round-a-bout, I find it completely matches the story-line. The unusual adventure needs a writing syle to complement its exciting subtleness, and Jules Verne does just that. Read this from cover to cover and don't skip a word, because each and every one is of significance."
4,Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,"Excellent book for young adults and grownups alike. It is difficult to imagine that this book was first published in 1870.I still have my original copy; the annotated Walter James Miller edition(1976) by Thomas Y. Crowell Company.Was Verne the first true science fiction writer in the world? I'm not sure, but Nemo is a complicated figure. Anti-colonialist, scientific & engineering genius, expatriate, madman? Professor Pierre Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land provide the foils for Nemo's adventures. Highly recommended!"
4,Science lovers special!,Sheer adventure narrative for the aquatic zoology and oceanography nerd. Captain Nemo the prototype for the mad at mankind genius villain; bad yet sympathy-deserving.Actually challenging reading: many 50 science terms.
5,Luis's review,This book is a good book. I like this book beacause Buster won the Brain.IT is a cool book to read.IT is a funny book. THE END.
2,Does not support handsfree calling,"Sony made a big marketing mistake with this unit. It does not support voice commands, voice tags, voice dialing, or any handsfree calling at all, regardless of what capabilities your phone has. The ONLY handsfree call you can make from the unit is last number redial. All other calls must be placed from the phone as usual, then you must use call transfer to route to the bluetooth unit. This doesn't meet the legal requirements in the states or countries for which it was designed and marketed. It's a big disappointment, and a big waste of money."
3,Make a U-Turn and start Back At One,"I wasn't really feeling GEMINI, at all. I generally will listen to a CD in it's entirety before passing judgement; however, I couldn't resist the urge to fast forward to the next track after one minute of listening didn't manage to draw me into the music. Brian serenades me with his voice but in this effort I felt he'd ""already done it before."" Many of the tracks sounded as if he sampled his own work, laid some new vocals and slapped a new title on it and voila - a mishap. I give GEMINI a three because there were only three tracks that kept me from considering this effort a total flop."
3,brian's songs,"it's okay. i have four other cd's by brian that are great. this is just..............ok. rvf from sedona,az"
2,I expected more Brian - this is a disappointment !,"This CD lacks effort. Only one or two decent tracks, the rest of the tracks leave a lot to be desired. A real downer."
3,"Stick with the slow jams, Brian!","Like a few of the other reviewers stated, I'm not sure if Brian McKnight is cut out for anything more than smooth ballads. Like all of his other albums, there are a handful of nice slow jams, but his up-tempo material is really not his strongsuit. Although Brian is one of my favorite artists, it's not for his up-tempo tracks. He has really been trying hard to win over some of the younger fans, but he needs to realize that even the younger fans pay attention to street cred and acceptable material. Aside from the up-tempo attempts, Brian does have a couple of good slow jams, but nothing that stands out from his other ones in previous albums. I must say, that his albums have failed to get better from previous releases, but if you like Brian McKnight in general, I'm sure you'll find at least a couple of tracks from this album that you can burn onto your own collection."
4,It's still Brian Mcknight,"I don't understand why some people expect Brian Mcknight's new music to sound just like his old music. If I wanted to hear his old cds then I would pull them out of my cd case. Every time an artist puts out a cd, in some way it reflects HIS experiences in life. Not his fans. We should be thankful that a such a talented musican, singer-songwriter gives us the privilege of sharing it with him. I'm just happy to have another Brian Mcknight cd to add to my collection."
2,Astrology: Sign of a Artist suffering from His own Idenity,"while Brian Mcknight knows what His Zodiac Sign is&the Month He was born in,musically He is truly suffering from idenity Loss. somewhere between the early 80's till early 90's is where Mcknight is swimming in. while He is a Very talented vocalist,Multi Instrumentalist&songwriter it's been quite a while since He has left a mark.on this set He can't make up his mind if He wants to Be R.kelly,Ronald Isley,Prince,&Others.as long as Brian Mcknight has Been around you would think He wouldn't still be trying to find His Own Musical Idenity but going by this Album he truly is spinning in Music Circles&no direction appears in sight. this Cat should be alot further in His Career than he is."
1,Major Disappointment,"I've always loved Brian McKnight's music. From ""Back at One"" to ""Still the One"" to ""One Last Cry"" and ""Anytime""... loved em all. If you're hoping for anything remotely like those, you'll wish you hadn't spent the money. It's such a shame that I have to not recommend this album, but it just doesn't shine. I sense that he feels like he needs to get back to ""his roots"" by going more soulful, more slow hip-hoppy. And while he succeeds on those points, it's just not gonna produce a top 10 single on regular top 40 radio. It sorta reminds me of later efforts from Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston where they stopped delivering the kinds of music their fans wanted and instead did their own thing. What a shame, and what a letdown."
2,Short shelf-life!,"I seem to be having the same problem as everyone else. I bought this DSL modem mostly to get UPNP support for my Nintendo Wii. Worked great for the first 6 months, but I noticed lately it can't connect to the DSL provider or when it does everything crawls and eventually it looses sync. Sadly, I had to replace it with my old DSL modem (SpeedStream) which works perfectly (so I know its not my phone lines or other problems). Also, I noticed the Zoom DSL modem heats up pretty bad, wondering if theres a connection between that and its failure rate.I would definitely find another DSL modem, especially after reading all the other posts regarding the poor reliability issues."
1,Best used for target practice,"Horrible horrible horrible! I get booted from it every few minutes and then I get ""No response from wireless router or access point"" And it takes me an hour to get back on, just to be on for 5 minutes, then I have to start all over again. I can get 2 bars or signal from it while my laptop is sitting right beside it, yet my neighbors router is shown at full signal so I know it isn't my computer. This is so bad, I'd rather go back to dial up!"
1,AT&T DSL users stay away,"It did not pick up the DSL signal from my AT&T High-speed Internet service. I had to return it and get a 2Wire, which AT&T officially supports and which works without any problems."
1,Internet connection turns off all the time,"After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then, the only solution is to constantly turn it on and off.No lightning have fallen near my house, nor any other extraordinary event have happened.I have looked for help from zoom, internet forums and my ISP company and all of them agreed that it is a hardware problem, apparently a common one if you buy an X6 zoom modem/router.The only definite solution: buy a new modem (not a zoom modem)"
1,"It may be a good product, but Verizon made it junk","I bought this unit to replace a unit sold to me by the phone company. It was to be ""combatable"" to DSL Verizon. Not so said the phone company. You have to by from us, they said. I battled this unit for a month. It changed my IP so many times and would lock up. Customer service from Zoom was as bad as Verizon. One would say, ""Its the phone company's problem"", then the phone company would say, ""Its the modem company's problem"". I was given a modem from a friend that had a wireless modem from a different phone system. It works great. Buyer beware. It does not work as advertised."
1,I'm looking for a different router,"I'm using a Mac and a PC with this product. From the start, I could not get it to set-up like the directions instructed. I had to bring it to my local Res-Net office on campus for them to set-up. The big complaint I have with this router is the connection with the computer needs to be reset nearly every day for me, sometimes three times a day (PC and Mac). Depending on how heavy my internet usage is."
1,Not worth the money,"I've had this item for 3 months, the support people don't know how to handle wireless connections, they keep referring you to the manual... and give you no directions... The unit itself isn't compatible with verzion.. this unit continously goes off the net, and must the software must be reloaded, or Verizon called to reset the signal to your home.."
5,Zooooooom!,"I bought this while in the throes of tech-horror. I was trying to get a wireless network going with my mac and stereo and spent days fooling with settings and rebooting my old Actiontec wireless modem each time. Yuk! A mac tech suggested a new modem. It didn't help with the network--noone could figure out why, but I never could set one up. However, I'm very happy with the modem. It's strong, it restarts and connects flawlessly, and I've had absolutely no trouble with it. As far as I'm concerned, the best electronic equipment is the stuff that I can just forget about. The zoom is just that."
2,A REAL MESS,SNL deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how/why it matters/mattered. This is not that book. The author simply has no objectivity so he can't tell us the truth. If you want to read what you already know about the show's popular sketches this is the book to read. We learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together- or not- to make the show last this long. Far too little time is spent on the first 5 years and that first amazing cast. But if you want to hear about 'Pat' and Victoria Jackson this is the book for you. A real mess.
4,Great read for SNL Fans,"If you're interested in hearing first-hand from the cast & producers of SNL, this is the book for you. Definitely long as it deals with everything from the beginning to early 2000's. I found it distracting at times the organization of interview snippets in certain chapters, but definitely worth a read if you're a fan of SNL."
2,100 pages of interesting in a 500 page book,"Did you know that the writers/performers worked all night on Tuesdays? Or that Lorne Michaels was a dysfunctional father figure? Well you'll be reminded about every fifth page of this yawner. Sure there's some interesting gossip and sniping, but save yourself some time and get the cliff notes because this is about 100 pages of interesting in a 500 page book."
4,real interesting Book,"there was a time when SNL was on the Cutting edge of TV.but those days have long past&too be honest the plug on the Show should have been pulled at least 11-12 years back.but in it's early days it set the standards for shows like In Living Color""&what you see with ""Madd TV"" among other shows.I always wondered why the Show had so few African-American Cast Members over the years?Eddie Murphy is Missing something badly in here for me.of course you would want too hear Eddie Murphy reflect on the show.interesting stories on John Belushi.He was something else.this book deals with alot of various topics."
2,From Chase to Fallon,"This book is an interesting read that is easy to get finished in one sitting. If one is looking for a detailed narrative, this book probably is not it."
3,"Hey, like, it's a neat book, but, you know . . .","SNL is an absolute classic! Ground-breaking comedy, innovative, at times quite outreageous - it's all that. And more. This book brings us stories from SNL and stories about SNL's cast, writers and management ""straight from the horse's mouth"".It's a fun read. BUT - the book would have been, like, so much less, you know, annoying, if - like - the authors had actually applied themselves to, like, editing the utterings and mutterings of the people interviewed for the book at least, like, a little bit. You know?Reading page after page of what appear to be verbatim transcriptions of interview segments started getting old *really* quickly. And then it was just very off-putting. Especially for non-California, non-US readers. Hey, like, wow!"
4,A great read for fans of SNL,"I'm a big fan of SNL, so I was quite excited to get into this book. It did not let me down. The reading is very easy, and the format facilitates the transmission of information one wouldn't normally know: the writers, actors, producers, etc. do most of the talking here in short interview snippets, filled in occasionally by explanations of context from the authors of the book. It's a great situation, which allows for memorable moments like Will Ferrell saying Chevy Chase was the worst host he ever worked with. It's fascinating stuff, and I'd recommend it to any SNL fan."
5,"I hate Chevy Chase, too!","This book is a must read for anyone who grew up watching Saturday Night Live, even in the bad years. I really enjoyed reading this book because it gave first hand accounts of events,from several different points of view. The thing that struck me most about reading this was how much talent Lorne Michaels had and misused through the years. He is nothing, if not short sighted!I also love how cast members and writers all just aired their dirty laundry. All of the feuds and petty arguments came through! What can I say, I'm sycophantic for the original cast, and several of the later casts. If you are a fan of SNL, any cast, this book is for you!"
5,Some reviews are mean-spirited & personal,"...It's a fun book, full of fascinating stories, and if you like SNL, the odds are overwhelming you'll like Live from NY too. Thanks!"
3,Informative and an unusual format,"The number of interviews is quite astounding. This is a very informative work and I believe it's probably highly (if not totally) accurate.The format is a little unusual. They interviewed dozens of people and then printed fragments of conversations together (grouping them by ""subject"" area)."
5,For anyone who LOVES SNL!,"This book may look big in size but it is a quick read. It is mostly old cast members, writers, and hosts talking about the show. It is the most honest look at the show that I have ever seen. It is sweet, touching, funny, and raw. I couldn't put down. I was fascinated by people who actually knew John Belushi talking about his last days. Also Adam Sandler's dismissile from SNL. No matter what cast is your favorite this behind the scenes book will give you a new perspective of the show."
4,An interesting overview of SNL's backstage history,"This book, comprised mostly of interviews with people that have worked on the Saturday Night Live over the years, really works thanks to the editing. As one person tells an anecdote, Miller & Shales follow it up with someone else telling a contradicting story, or with more details from another source.The story spans 28 years of the show's history, and does so in great detail. However, Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad's ""Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live"" does a better job of chronicling the earliest days of the show."
1,Vastly Overated,"When I began to read this book, I was expecting a superbly written historical account of the Saturday Night Live television show, and instead got nothing more than a plethora of transcribed interviews with people associated with the show.When I began reading this book, I was hoping the authors would include a listing of all of the people who have graced the show as regular performers, or one of all of the guest hosts, but none such information was offered.Apparently all it takes to write a best-selling book nowadays is a tape recorder, and a word processor, because that is all this book is comprised of.A court stenographer could have written it."
3,"Not astoundingly good, but not heartbreakingly bad, either.","This book seemed to be one long love letter to the brilliance of Lorne - kind of off putting. There were lots of great anecdotes, but to a guy in his early 30'swho grew up watching Saturday Night Live in the early 90's it was hard to identify with the stories from the 70's and early 80's. Additionally, the kindle edition probably takes away from the book itself - I found myself having to go online to see pictures of who these people were so that I could identify them."
3,"Decent overview in a sea of SNL tributes, choppy reading, excellent bathroom book, nice gift for the fan.","Purchased as a gift for my SNL-loving spouse, it's a great bathroom book, because of the short excerpt format. If you are looking for a flowing chronology of the history of Saturday Night, it might be hard to stick with it. It's very broken up, the voices change with every page or two, making it feel disjointed. Because our memories and someone else's memory of the same event aren't always the same, you get amusing perspectives from different egomaniacs claiming to have the same great ideas. Nice background of behind-the-scenes as promised, lots of dirt on the sex and drugs, as expected. Not something I would have purchased for myself, even though I'm a fan, but compared to the other offerings out there, this one really is the most authoritative, closest to the source, and most accurate."
4,Saturday Night Alive!,"A legitimate page turner. As a fan of SNL I enjoyed each moment. I particularly enjoyed discovering that some whom I thought to be jerks turned out to be very likeable...of course the opposite also applies. To those who say SNL is ""not as good as it used to be"" I say it is so much better than it used to be. Don't get me wrong, I loved the originals and the Crystal, Guest, Short and Shearer years were fabulous, but Farley and Murphy and Gross and MacDonald and Sanz and Meadows and Ferrell and Morgan and Kataan and Fey and Fallon and Dratch are also great. It has big problems of course, too many hosts whose movie is opening that week, and characters repeated too often, but on the whole, it's always exciting and funny. I only wish that 'Live From New York' included more cast members."
3,Disappointing,"I was very interested in the book as I have watched SNL for years, but found the Shales book dull, slow moving and frankly, I don't want to read the mundane contributions from ""stars"", mostly about nothing in particular. I also do not share the adulation of Belushis talent and ego - it does get better in the latter half of the book which is why I rated it 3 stars. Probably a little high."
2,"Eh. With so much talent, they put out this?","Given the reputations of those involved, especially Shales, this is a hellacious disappointment and certainly not worth the hardcover price at any discount. They couldn't even get Murphy to talk to them and, given that he saved the show, that is a major problem in a book of this size and alleged scope. O'Donoghue, who was viciously brilliant, is reduced to a parody. There's nothing here you couldn't have figured out from reading years of tv commentary or watching the show."
2,Love It or Hate It,"I try to remain neutral about this topic, because of the way that SNL has changed over the years. What was once a dynamo on Saturday night and what changed it to a mediocre program, to one that is still trying to find itself, given the politics of the Hollywood games and players. This is essentially an oral history of the groundbreaking show from the early days to the present. Nearly 600 pages of interviews from the writers and comedians who made the show what it is, and the book includes gossip as well as tributes to deceased cast members likeBelushi, Farley and Hartman. A lot of crude language and anecdotes. I don't know what they're there. Maybe someone thought it was funny, but it detracts from the overall book."
2,"Yadda, yadda, yadda!","If you took out every comment by cast, writers and producers on trying (unsuccessfully)to figure out Lorne Michaels, this heavy tome would easily be cut in half. Too much whining, too little interesting, historical information for me, a long time fan of the show."
3,Too Long,"The book starts strong and does a great job of covering the early years (the part I suspect most readers will care about) but seriously bogs down as it moves into coverage of the early 90's.Ultimately, it could have been at least 100 pages shorter. By the time I got to the 20+ pages of recollections on Lorne Michaels, I couldn't take it anymore."
2,way too long,"I agree with whoever wrote that this book was way too long and unorganized. I was hoping to learn more about the behind the scenes works, and boy, did I. Drugs, partying, sexism, racism, it's all here and more. There are some great gems among all the trivia people already know.But it's all quotes from the different actors, writers and producers. There are some photos to break things up, but nothing else. No cute little sidebars or anything. Heck, if it's good enough for my school textbooks, why not put some in here. I don't have ADD, but it got tedious after awhile.The format makes for an odd read. You get things like someone rapsodizing about what a ""beautiful person"" John Belushi was a couple paragraphs after someone reminiscing about the time he set stuff on fire and passed out in a drunken stupor. Oh well."
2,Two Days I'll Never Get Back,"Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller seemingly provided an opportunity for free therapy sessions to all former and current SNL staffers. The whining, moaning and venting about how hard their lives are is more laughable than most of the SNL skits they've ever performed in.The book provided nothing interesting in how the show actually operates. Sniping at one another seems to be the only reason for most cast member to even agree to be interviewed for the book. Missed opportunities by not interviewing lesser cast members (though they might have turned down the authors) could have painted a complete other picture.The special on Biography (on A&E) was more interesting than this book - and was only an hour. Catch that instead."
3,"Not bad, but not Earth shaking...","This was a good book. That said, it didn't tell me a lot I didn't already know. I was surprised to find out what a tool Chevy Chase is, but the book really only glossed over that too. Mostly, it's a lot of producers, writers and network execs giving divergent accounts of why stuff went right or wrong. It's hard to tell who the liars are, but obviously there are plenty of them here since so many people contradict each other. Quotes from the actors make up a minority of the book.The whole idea that the book is ""full of juicy gossip"" is wrong IMO. It's actually full of TV execs talking about why they think everything was someone else's fault."
4,All opinions,"I really enjoyed reading this book and felt like I got an insiders look into SNL. The book allowed everyone to say their peace and give their side of the story. It was interesting to see all of the dynamics from the executives, to Loren, to the writers and the actors. I felt like i could really form my own opinion based on the testimonies of the people involved. It was an easy to read format with little blurbs from each person involved in a particular topic/cast/year. The writers would all a paragraph here and there to help transition between topics."
4,"Interesting behind-the-scenes look at SNL, but I got bored","If you're a hardcore SNL fan who is interested in learning the history of the show, this book is for you. If you want to read about what happened the behind-the-scenes--the sex, drugs, and so on--this book is for you. I liked the way the people involved told the bulk of the story. I loved the first 25-30% of the book but then it felt like I was reading the same story from one season to the next: this guy did these drugs, this woman was sleeping with this guy, this one wasn't too popular with other cast members ... and then that season ended and another began. I couldn't finish it."
4,Awesome,"I loved the book. Living in the mid west, you're not privy to rumors and stories in the local paper about SNL. I loved reading inside stories and such. The only bad thing I could say was that the book should have put some thumbnail pictures up of those quoted. It was hard with the lesser known cast members that were quoted, and trying to remember who they were."
2,Nothing new here.,"I have been in an insatiable mood lately for new progressive rock music buying CDs on a daily basis. I have uncovered some superb new bands such as Riverside, Abigail's Ghost, Frost, Phideaux with the first two named bands being absolutely exceptional. I was encouraged by other reviews to try IQ and this album particularly as being an exceptional and representative example. I think what one reviewer said sums it all up. IQ have managed to be what they are because they simple outlasted everyone else. I was sorely disappointed with this album for its total lack of anything original and new. Musically its fine progressive rock but it is not original. Yes it is Genesis, come Marillion etc. but one thing it is not is anything like Seconds Out. Overall I found the album flat and uninspiring...sorry."
3,Self Help,"I enjoy listening to Wayne Dyer--his voice is soothing to me; his wisdom is mixed with humor; I can relate to most of what he says. This CD was a little different for me--I couldn't listen to it as I was driving in the car. The breathing techniques (exercises) he has you do, are a little thought provoking and strenous. The other part of the CD--listening to his suggestions for healthy living was more what I expected."
5,The Mackintosh Treasury,"This is an amazing, in-depth book which everyone should read! C. H. Mackintosh has the Spirit-filled ability to travel wonderfully deep into the Word of God. I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a closer walk with God!"
2,Visually stunning but story adulterated,"The movie captures the look and feel of Narnia and many scenes are beautifully blocked and filmed. However, the movie's creators tampered too much with the actual story. This is a flaw not because they ""should"" or ""must"" copy the books exactly;we all recognize that some creativity may be required to retell a book's story as a smashingly good movie. This, they failed to do. The ridiculous attempt at a love story between Susan and the Prince was embarassing. And turning Miraz the usurper into the first acceptor of the new land was totally unnecessary and ineffective. News flash: There is a reason these stories have stood the test of time and been read and re-read by children and adults, generation after generation-- they are good stories! Don't mess with them unless it's absolutely necessary and is done effectively."
1,Outrageous,"As many others have said, the unnecessary deviations from the book were just horrible. Why not just make up a new story about Narnia that Lewis never told before ?The character relationship development was horrible."
1,Infuriatingly Inaccurate! 10 Thumbs Down,"*** Infuriatingly Inaccurate! *** Die Hard Narian Fans take heed to my advice and don't even waste your time on this movie. For example Disney thought that it was ok to allow Prince Caspian to KISS Queen Susan ( Attention Disney: That NEVER happened in the book! ). There are a number of other inaccurate happenings in this movie, but I will not waste your time to list them all ... This movie is in my own Top TEN most hated movies of all time. I REFUSE to buy this version. I will not waste my money on it!!!"
3,Of Mice and Martin,"There's nothing particularly good or bad about PRINCE CASPIAN; it's an all-round average piece of movie-making. I'm not convinced this will keep the kids entertained, and many adults will find themselves staving off the occasional yawn. At least some attempts at humour have been injected into the script, although their success is decidedly patchy. There are also some pretty good set pieces. Not much else to say really, except that the mice are extraordinarily large and there's a dwarf who bears an uncanny resemblance to Martin Amis! Yet another film that fails to do the source material justice. It really only deserves 2.5 stars."
4,The first was superior and waiting on the third,"I am a HUGE fan of CS Lewis Narnia Chronicles. I read them as a child and reread them routinely. This second production (Prince Caspian) took some liberties I didn't really care for, but in a general way it was good. IF you have kids, FIRST try to get them to read the books. I can't imagine seeing these movies without having read them. CS Lewis is also the author of many GREAT Christian books.'Screwtape Letters' is another GREAT book by Mr. Lewis and has a lot of humor, along with very clear issues with the ""other side"" for us older children."
3,It was OK,"I am sorry to admit it but I do not think this was as good as the first one. Don't get me wrong, it was OK. I just liked the first one better. I'll give it a so-so rating. I think the story line needed more depth."
4,"Good Show, but sad.","I really enjoyed this movie. The sound effects are great. It's way more intense than the first one. I haven't read any of the books but, I would really like for there to be another movie. I believe the it has a really sad ending. All in all, it's a good flick. Watch it today if you like fantasy."
4,A step down from the first movie.,"It is a good movie overall, but way too predictable and after seeing the first movie, it was a step down. I would recomend the movie. It was worth the money."
4,Narnia: Pricnce Caspian,"My child loved this-me, not so much. Very elaborate and well-made movies but when it's over, I came away with little in terms of lasting impressions."
4,"Awesome Movie, Spectacular acting and graphics.........but","Ok , this is a wonderful movie... The two chronicles movies are my absolute favorite movies... I saw it in the theatre on opening weakend. I am a huge fan. This 3 disc collectors edition was money WELL SPENT. It has hours of behind the scenes, which is what i like.. .. the only problem was, The dvd came, in a non-padded envelope, and the the whole dvd case was cracked and broken. I am surprised the discs were not harmed... Oh well. It was worth the money.. I just wish that it had been better and more properly shipped"
4,Enjoyable to watch with the family,"This was good to watch as a marathon with the whole family. One of the disc, maybe #2, didn't seem to work at first. But we tried it again and let it stay in the player for over a minute and then it started working. (A minute is a long time in this day and age of instant gratification.)"
3,america's critic,"this wasnt that great loved the cgi thats about it the acting wasnt great and story well was like sitting and reading a book dull,, maybe ok for some kids most kids would be playing on the floor with the carpet while this is on."
4,Chronicles of Narnia,"I got this series for my Daughter, she loves the entire series.. I find this quite entertaining we have watched this second movie twice since it arrived"
1,So disappointed,"When The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe came out I didn't want to see it. I practically learned to read on the books, and they have remained favorite annual re-reads. As it turned out, I had no choice but to see it, through my work, and I was amazingly and pleasantly surprised.So I decided to see Prince Caspian too. Again I was surprised, but this time I was surprised by my disappointment. Did not follow the storyline at all. A lot of noise and violence, that was my main impression."
5,Very good movie,I thorougly enjoyed watching the Chronicles of Narnia movies. They are greatly entertaining and the 3D amazing. Recommended for the whole family.
3,fine,"Our kids liked the books of Narnia, and we like to see them watching the videos and have fun. At least we can see them liking what they watch together as a group of 4 or 5 kids who enjoy each others company!"
3,Anti-Climatic,"At the beginning, I was impressed. There are several good scenes written into the plot. However, the duel between Peter and Miraz and the ensuing battle delayed the logical highpoint of the story: Aslan. Furthermore, when Aslan does come, the battle is won with a ridiculous looking (even for a fantasy) sequence of summoned tree and water spirits. All of this made the film at least 30 minutes longer but in no degree better."
2,Not nearly as good as the first movie,"I had never read the books, but I really enjoyed the first 'Narnia' movie. Seemed like a pleasant mix of child literature and fantasy writing, and that movie was a pleasant surprise (part 'Harry Potter', part 'Lord of the Rings'). This new one isn't nearly as good though; the acting seems more stilted, the story isn't as interesting, and the religious overtones are much more prevalent. I was looking forward to this, but can't recommend it others"
4,Prince Caspian,The movie was very good. It was close to the book. I think the first movie was better.
3,First one is better,"This movie is nice but not even close to the Lion, Witch, Wardrobe.Caspian doesn't have the same charm or magic as the first one and they don't follow the book at all. The acting is also def. not as good.Al in all I was disappointed."
4,Prince Caspian,"With More Action and Violence in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian I would say this is one of the best Narnia Movies I have seen. I do wish it had more of adventure like the first movie.About 85% of the movie was one big battle. It doesn't beat The ""Lord of The Rings"" Trilogy in action, but it does have more creatures. As a movie critic for Prince Caspian, I give this 4 out of a possible 5 stars."
3,Not so great,"If you have read the book you will be dissapointed. They didn't follow the book very well at all. It just wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. Hope the next one is better..."
1,terrible movie,"This movie is absaloutley awful, the acting was so bad, it made me cringe in my seat. This is one example where they should have completely recasted. It was also upsetting when it decided that it wanted to be ""Lord of the Rings"" with all the screenshots and battles. I love the books, the Chronicles of Narnia are one of my favorite series, and the previous adaptation of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" I loved, but this strayed much too far from the book. The reason the four children slipped by with no acting ability in the first one was because their roles were not so serious. I mean, here they are killing other human beings without even flinching! Susan just whips out her bow and shoots trained soldiers off their horses with the nonchalance of getting out of bed! I tend to be very hard on movies. If you can sit through terrible unconvincing acting that makes Vin Diesels ""Fast and the Furious"" look like ""There Will be Blood"", than it's a mildly enjoyable time at the cinema."
5,A continuation of cinematic excellence,"As the previous film of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" septalogy, ""Prince Caspian"" honours the original fantasy novel by Professor C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) with its high standard of acting, cinematography, special effects, and, of course, a good screen play. As the previous one did, this film grows on the viewer, and, when seen for the first time, although impressive and endearing, it is perhaps not as deeply successful as when seen repeatedly, allowing the viewer to better capture many beautiful details missed before."
2,Is that supposed to be irony?,"Not only was this a poor followup to an initial success in the first of the Narnia films, but it would be a dreadfully poor stand-alone film. The plot was convoluted and hard to follow, and while the original cast did well, the additions just left no memorable trace. The story, itself, felt like it wasn't well fleshed out, or the editing wasn't properly done resulting in a plot that felt forced and an audience that didn't care. The film was beautiful to watch. Its landscapes and CGI were stunning, on par with the first film."
5,Excellent Service,"Classic 3-disk Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian:I can only comment that the disk came 2-3 days after my order, so it was really delivered fast.Due to the combination of many situations over the past month we have been unable to watch the film, outtakes, etc. I'm sure the quality will be excellent, and I look forward to a breathing spell to watch it all."
5,the best narnia movie yet!,"Full of action, cool war scenes, and engaging characters, ""Prince Caspian"" is by far the BEST NARNIA MOVIE YET!!! (and yes, I have seen all three several times!)There is one scene with two 'things' named Thirst and Hunger that is pretty... well, scary for younger kids.Other than that, this is a great family film!"
5,Prince Caspian,"When it came out on the ""big screen"" the film was not nearly as well receieved as The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was. I admit that when I first saw it, I thought it was not quite as complex as the first one. However, after watching it again (I bought this and The L,W&W so my children could see them before watching Dawn Treader at the theater) my opinion has changed. I greatly enjoyed this film, even with the differences from the book. (The differences from the books in each of the movies, including Dawn Treader, might disappoint faithful fans of C.S. Lewis, and I understand. Yet, in some ways, the differences provide for broadened ideas of how the same or similar truths can be told.)"
5,Fantastic!,This is a great movie. It is very entertaining. I will look forward to seeing the other movies in this series!
2,Very Disappointing,"If you enjoyed the book, you won't want to watch the Disney version of this movie. Characterization was changed (a friendly dwarf became a nasty grump, Prince Caspian and King Peter had jealousy issues); scenes were added that weren't in the book, and basically all of the best parts of the book were omitted. There were battles that never took place. In fact, fighting was the main focus of this movie. Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie. If Disney wanted to create a fantasy battle movie, they should have just hired someone to write one. Prince Caspian is definitely NOT the Prince Caspian that C.S. Lewis wrote. I will definitely not watch any more Disney adaptations of Narnia."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"After an incredible debut with ""The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe,"" I was a bit disappointed by this movie from the Narnia series. The movie doesn't stick very well to some parts of the book, obviously to flash it up for hollywood. The movie also lasts an astounding 144 minutes- way longer than it should have. It tends to drag on, and I found myself longing for the credits.It's a good story for the kids, provided they can sit through the over 2 hour movie. It does promote good values of honor and loyalty, as true to the Narnia series."
4,"Embellished, but a great family movie","While I realise this was not pure C. S. Lewis, I think this film was true to the spirit (especially the Christian spirit) of his books. In fact I have found the two movies in this series to be charming and well-made. Aside from this, I find them to be in some ways more vibrant and compelling than Lewis' often wooden tales. I hope many will see this movie--consider it a vote for good family entertainment. For, in these movies we seldom experience anything approaching the self-indulgence and brattiness found in the Harry Potter films, or the frantic pacing, slang dialogue, raunch and general noise of the Disney/Pixar movies. As for the story, it is a simple good-vs-bad tale. There is no lengthy quest involved--the kings and queens merely need to rally the Narnians to repell an occupying army--but the characters keep us engaged and they are convincingly played by the actors."
5,One word: AMAZING!,"I saw ""Prince Caspian"" immediately after watching ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" on TV. I was blown away by LWW, and I knew I had to watch Prince Caspian.Get this, I wasn't a fan of Narnia (or didn't even knew about Narnia, for that matter).So I decided to watch trailers for Prince Caspian, and it looked AMAZING!I watched it in theater, and I was just blown away. So, I saw it three more time in theaters.ANYONE will like this movie... It's just beyond amazing.I own the DVD now, and I surely will be watching this just about every weekend!Buy it..."
3,Too much departed from the book,"I was disappointed in the departures from the written text. When I saw the first movie, I was left feeling wonderful. This one had too much war in it. I felt like someone was trying to replicate Lord of the Rings. I think C.S. Lewis would have been disappointed in the movie and feel that it missed the whole point of the story.For the next movie, I hope they return to the story a bit more."
2,Not to happy,This was suppose to be a new DVD however it does not work very good. We had to go to the video store and rent one from them to watch it.
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I respectfully disagree with some of the other commentators. I don't think this movie was particularly good. It was considerably violent -- Despite the caution taken to not show much blood, innumerable people/creatures are killed, even by our heroes. But the non-stop battles don't serve to advance the plot much, and there is poor, if any, real character development. While I loved the books and enjoyed the first movie, sadly, I could hardly wait until this second installment was over. Hopefully they'll do better next time."
1,terribly disapointed,"I greatly enjoyed this book, but found almost no similarities between it and this movie. The plot was completely wrong. Prince Caspian is described as a child in the book. His uncle speaks to him as though he were a small child, certainly not a young man. Aslan is very minor in the movie, which takes all the power right out of it. All the battle scenes are ridiculous. They changed almost everything important. The only thing they were on target with is they capture the essence of reepacheep perfectly, but other than that this movie is a huge waste of time, if you love c.s. lewis. Maybe you would like it if you never read the book. But honestly the book is much more interesting"
2,A disappointment and where is the book?,"I thought ""The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was brilliant. I could not wait for this movie to be released in theatres. I waited two and a half years for this film and I was disappointed. I thought that there was hardly anything from the book at all. There was way too many things added in this film like the battle at Miraz's Castle, Susan and Caspian being in love, and the White Witch almost coming back to life. None of those things happened in the book. In the last movie at least they tried hard to stick to the book, but in this film it seemed like there was no effort for that at all. I also did not like the addition of certain creatures like the giant walking trees. If you have not read any of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" books, then maybe you will like this movie, but if you love the books you may not like this film at all."
3,It's okay,"The movie is good if you just see the movie, but for those of us who love the books, it was disappointing. You always expect the movies to be different than the books, but this had too many differences. Wardrobe had some changes - nothing really major. Caspian had nearly everything different. There were battles that didn't happen in the book, there weren't other major scenes that did happen. I really hope that the Dawn Treader follows the book more closely than Caspian did."
3,"Good, if not combined with the book.","I am one of those people who believe the book is always better than the movie. This movie is good, if you just detach it from the book."
2,"Ok, but definetly not great","This 2nd one is definetly not as good as the first one. I'm big into movies and always buy blu-ray, especially when it comes to animated stuff. Younger kids might like it just as much, but I didn't at all. I was kind of lost in the beginning trying to remember where the last one left off, so it would be a wise decision to watch the first one right before watching the second one. Wish they would have made it more exciting and better overall."
3,Not bad.. first one was better,"Prince Caspian was pretty good, but I think the first one was better. Little romance thing between Susan and Prince Caspian was a little weird. Great to have if you want to start a collection, but probably wouldn't have purchased it otherwise."
3,"Not as good as the first one, but...","I thought the first Narnia movie was more kid friendly. Prince Caspian was slightly darker. But, all-in-all, a good movie. I'd recommend it to friends with kids 9 and over."
5,Good Family Movie (Age 13+),"I ordered this movie for the whole family. We all enjoyed the first one.Quick delivery as usual, no problems, 5 stars again."
4,Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian,"This was a good movie I liked it, but since this is the last movie that all four of the Pevensies are in Narnia together I really have no desire to watch the last film.The battle scene was awesome but not as good and the first film battle. But this wasn't a bad movie, I might buy it on DVD."
3,It's not a bad movie,"The main reason I got this movie was because of the song near the end by Regina Spektor. I really liked it, so I got the movie and the soundtrack off of Itunes. The movie itself is decent, but it's not one of my favorites or anything."
5,Great movie!,"A bit off from the book in terms of accuracy, but still a great story line and movie. I'm glad to own it."
1,What a Disappointment,"I grew up on the Narnia Books and thought The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was well adapted to the big screen. However, Prince Caspian seemed to try to add all of the adventures of current box office hits rather than going with the strength of the story. Everything seemed too over the top: the battlescenes, the attempt at a love line between Caspian and Susan, the lack of quality character improvement. Urf. The scenery and cinematography don't make up for the lack of substance. If they can't pull it together for Dawn Treader, this will be a movie series to miss..."
4,Great movie! Great story!,"My 7-yr-old daughter and I had loved the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and we were looking forward to watching Prince of Narnia. This movie does not disappoint! We loved the story; it even has a romantic element in it, which surpised me, but it's all innocent. Lot more fighting scenes than the first movie, but my daughter didn't mind at all. We were disappointed, however, due to the fact that this DVD didn't have any fun special features, such as bloopers, like the LWW DVD had."
4,Great Family Movie,"This is a great and fun family movies. The video is excellent. The audio, 7.1 DTS master audio was some what disappointing. The audio was average and by far, does not make the top 25 list for best sound (audio track) on blu ray."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first.","I really like it. Of course I am a sucker for these fantasy movies. I even liked Golden Compass. This one was better quality than the first. But just didn't move me as much. I have only seen it once in theater and once on disc. Maybe as I view it more, it will get me."
4,Good movie,This is a good movie but I think the first one is way better. So bad Disney don't want to make another one
4,Good sequel,"Good movie, but my kids were sad that at the end of the movie, the 2 older children aren't allowed to return to Narnia in the next installment. ""Their work is done"" is the reason given by Aslan. But still a good movie."
4,Good but hoped for great!,"The first in this series was so excellent because relationships were primary and special effects and fighting was secondary. Unfortunately, this order got reversed in the sequel, ""Prince Caspian"". The special effects are astounding, and the fight scenes are ad nauseum; I just wish the relationships would have been more developed. I love Aslan, and we only get a glimpse of him here as opposed to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. #3???? Let's hope for the best!"
3,"Narnia, The Sequal","It's okay. If you've watched the first one, it doesn't hurt to watch the second. It's not something that will kill you if you miss it, but if you're looking for something to watch..."
2,Narnian History Rewritten by Hollywood,"I gave this installment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" two stars only because of the special effects. The story really departed from the book and could have been much better had it followed the book more closely. In the book, Prince Caspian was a young boy, NOT an adult. The Disney folks only made him an adult so they could work in a love interest with Queen Susan. I don't object to a love interest in a movie if it belongs. In this case, it was totally uncalled for. Finally, too many scenes were taken out that were in the book. For example, Aslan's romp with Bacchus and the Mynaids. Other scenes were substituted that were not in the book at all, such as the over-long battle scene in King Miraz's castle. In this installment of the Narnian Chronicles, Disney has rewritten history. For shame, Disney!"
2,Prince Caspian by C.S. Lewis or Andrew Adamson?,"Apparently Andrew Adamson thinks he can tell a better story than C.S. Lewis. Saying this movie is ""based"" on the book by the same title would be using the word ""based"" very loosely. While there are some commonalities between the two, probably 80 to 90% of the movie is comprised of material not in the book. If you are watching the movie without having ever read the books then it could be called a decent story. However, if you are expecting it to re-tell the story of Prince Caspian, then you will be greatly disappointed.Once again, Hollywood thought they could improve a story by re-making it, and once again they failed. A prime example . . . the added ""romance"" between two of the main characters. This was the worst addition of all!"
2,Disappointed,"I waited anxiously and patiently for the video release of Prince Caspian. As someone who has read the whole Narnia series, I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Yeah the special affects were cool, and most kids will probably like the movie. But this movie deviates so far from the original book that it would be easier to list the similarities between the two. Anyone who is a fan of C.S. Lewis' books should not waste their time seeing this."
1,"Almost All Fighting, Next to No Interesting Dialogue","This movie is essentially a 2-hour fight scene with about 20 minutes of half-interesting dialogue and story sprinkled in. Terribly violent and uninteresting. Honestly the most fighting I have ever seen in any movie (including Matrix Reloaded). I wholly regret the $1.99 I spent to rent it. Unless you want to see endless stabbings and blunt force traumas, do not see this movie."
5,This was the only on of the set I didn't have.,Now I have the complete set. I've enjoyed these dvd's since they first came out. I watch them quite often.
4,Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (Blu-Ray),"We liked the movie.2.5 hoursOverall good entertainment and linkage to first movie was good.Movie scheme is darker, not as close to the book as we'd like but action in HD was good. Depth and color stood out, but when much is night based it takes away a bit. Blu-Ray is suppose to be able to enhance even the night time movie filming, but this one didn't seem too. Two different HD TVs.Definitely teenager and up movie. Not one for the younger kids.Recommend:"
2,the chronicles of cash cow narnia,"Caspian lacks the heart and charm of Lion, Witch, Wardrobe. It felt stale, confusing and similar to the first film, full of dazzling critters rushing head first into another battle to save some ancient kingdom or whatever. It had been almost twenty-five years since I'd read Caspian, so I didn't remember the story. I had a hard time understanding the time frame relative to LWW. I wonder how they're going to gloss over The Horse and His Boy, that one sucked."
5,Another Quality Production,"As always, Disney has produced another first-rate production of the Chronicles of Narnia. The acting, wardrobe, scenerey and graphics are flawless and leave you with a deep desire for more. I can only say that for the extra $2.00 or less, the Disney production is light-years superior to the mediocre, cheap crud that the BBC produced."
4,A good sequel,Not like the first but it is a very dark story in the beginning. Good special effects. Narnia is taken down a different path in this story line.
2,Too Precious,"Too long and too precious. This second Narnia film still finds the children in wartime England waiting for a train when they are abruptly called back to Narnia. Hundreds of years after their visit from the wardrobe, once again evil outsiders are threatening to overwhelm the animals and folk of Narnia's forests. The children eventually save the day and return to the train station after heroic battles and soul searching speechifying. Although technically amazing, the story is drawn out to a sense of boredom and the characters, other than the children, lack a strength and sharpness that made the first film so enjoyable. It isn't a film we'll watch again and again as we have Wardrobe."
3,the chronicles of narnia/prince caspian,"Was not as good as the first dvd, truthfully i was a little disappointed."
2,Like most sequels,"They rushed making it and it is not at the quality as the first. Not a movie that I will watch over and over, dissapointed is my overall opinion."
3,Average film in an average franchise,"I liked the first Narnia film to some extent and I kind of feel the same about Prince Caspian. These films don't have the wonder or magic that the Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings series have. In fact my favorite part of the Narnia movies are all the talking animals. I seem to care about them more than the humans. There are some good things (hence the 3 stars I gave it), such as, the outstanding CGI, a nice musical score and most of the actors are above average. I just have no desire to see more of the Narnia world in the future. It is better than The Golden Compass, so it's not all bad."
1,Soylent Dick says: Utter Trash,The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe was bad enough. But THIS effort was so bad as to be beneath commenting on. The other negative reviews have said it all for me.
1,A Child's Book of Saints?????????????,"When I ordered this book, I was hoping to get a book for my daughter that would teach her about the Catholic saints. I think this book is better read under the influence of hallucinogenics or in a state of temporary insanity. I don't know where the author is coming from. Take this review however you want. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
2,Battery-charging problems,"I cannot believe I paid so much for a camcorder that has such a JUNKIE battery charger built in. If it gets bumped even slightly, or has too much pressure on the cord just laying there, it comes out. You pick up a camera thinking it is charged, and find out it is NOT!! Bought before going on vacation, & called the store upon my return to complain. They said, ""That is just Sony's way of making you buy a separate charger."" After several months of hassles, I notified Sony about my dissatisfaction with this, & their customer service rep sent me a smart-alec reply by e-mail. Won't buy another Sony product if that is how they take care of customers. Sandy"
1,Sony Handycam [messed] up my computer,"The USB software bundled by Sony for transferring images to computer COMPLETELY [MESSED] UP MY SYSTEM. The installation is very dicey. You need to do things in a precise order. It is prone to getting [messed] up,... it can't be fixed. As usual, the Sony software is a mess.Their instructions for unscrambling the mess don't work. They just get you deeper into the woods.Be sure to get the extended warranty if you buy this product. You will probably need it. As for the computer, it may require a complete disk wipe and reinstallation. God help you if you have RAID or something else. WHAT A MESS. Sony is big enough that they don't care. They don't have to."
4,What's Knot to like?,Great little knot guide! Good illustrations and directions are included. Nice small pocket size or put it in your workshop...
5,Knot nuts want naught,"Hard to add anything to the discussion, as it has all been said. This was a good purchase. I will make one comment I didn't see elswhere: the brass rivet that holds the cards together has a big enough opening to thread a piece of 550 through as a lanyard or threaded onto the hank of rope in a pack."
5,Great Knot Cards,"I purchased this item in the hopes of helping myself and my son to be better knot tiers. These little cards do a great job at educating in the art of the knot. The cards are thick plastic and should last a lifetime. If you are looking for a minimal tool to help boost your knot tying skills, a product which is long lasting, and for relatively cheap? Check this one out."
5,Very Cool,I ordered this mainly to learn some Knots. This is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip. Use the examples to try out some knots.Good product. Very useful.
3,Made in China,If I knew this was made in China I would have purchased a knot book printed in the USA instead.
3,Basic knowledge,"Most people tie the ""granny"" knots on everything, this field worthy guide will show you some of the basic knots."
5,Great Starter Cards,"My nephew wanted these for his survival kit. The cards are straightforward for him, and he's practiced them on his own. He takes them with him on his camping trips now, and likes to use these practical and functional knots. He's very happy with the cards. They're light, small, and waterproof."
5,Fun and great for camping,It is light weight and small so you can bring it on any adventure. Its easy to use and fun. I think most people would be very happy with this purchase.
5,Durable and Useful,"Ok - this is a durable, compact, and clear guide for tying knots. I keep it in my truck so that I can always reference the right way to lash something down. The cards are made out of plastic so they aren't going anywhere and the ink seems to stay on the cards well so far."
4,Great,The booklet is perfect for attaching to a backpack. The illustration is simple & also tells you which knots are best to use in a situation requiring tying knots. A must for anyone camping outdoors in a tent or mountain climbing.
5,Nice,"Now I can tie a slip knot. A small, yet simple card with more of the most used knots you should probably know how to tie."
4,For my kids,"I have 4 boys and don't know if our busy schedules will allow for boyscouts. This is one item that will help alleviate that. Road trips, rainy days or even before bed we get our rope and try out these awesome knots. These are hard plastic cards riveted together so you don't have to worry about losing or damaging them with a little moisture."
1,Sucralose!,This popcorn is sweetened with sucralose. Do a search to read about sucralose. I'm not eating this or feeding it to my family.
2,Very Little Flavor,"I know this popcorn is healthy and all but it has very little flavor. I have had much better kettle korn, maybe kettle korn that is not as healthy, but at least I can taste it."
5,The magic that was and will always be Connie Francis . . .,"Although Celine Dion nearly does with a couple of her numbers there is no female singer who can ""cry"" a tune like Connie Francis ! Her voice never ever fails to brings home to us as listeners' a true love, lost, unrequited or just never ever found. One indeed wonders to what heights this amazing performer could have taken her career if her vicious rape in a hotel room never happened. To the diva of my youth and the diva of my life time, long may your voice be heard on radios' gaga-gaga . . ."
4,A visit down memory lane,A good listen. Connie Francis was a favorite of my mother while I was growing up. Many of the songs on this CD are familiar favorites. Connie's voice with clarity and emotion brings heartache and hope alive for the listener.
5,Spot On!,"With great examples from the world of business and deep metaphysical truth, The Smart Spot builds a bridge from commerce to spirit that's 'Spot On'.Patricia Aburdene, coauthor, ""Megatrends"" series"
5,Excellent,"First book I've read that makes sense / is understandable to normal people. Unlike the usual stupifying fare, felt I could use some of this in the real world. Diagrams were helpful. Definitely a different take on intuition...."
3,ITS ABRIDGED,"I am sorely disappointed that this otherwise lovely addition is abridged. Perhaps that is stated somewhere in the product description, if so I missed it. Returning."
3,Wind in the Willows,"The book itself is beautiful, beautifully bound. My slight disappointment in my purchase is that nowhere in the description did I find that the book is abridged. I chose this edition of the classic because of the illustrations, and they are stunning, but the book was a gift for a ten-year old granddaughter, so I certainly did not want an abridged version.That said, the book is a treasure at the price."
1,So very sad,"When publishers abridge classics such as The Wind in the Willows they must be very respectful. And they should not make their own determinations of what a child can and cannot absorb or enjoy. It is very sad that they cut ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" from this edition. Children can and will get something valuable from such contemplatve texts, but only if we allow them access!"
2,It's Abridged,"I bought this copy of Kenneth Grahame's wonderful classic because the illustrations were so lovely. When I read the book however, I realized that this book, albeit with beautiful illustrations, was heavily abridged. I am sorely disappointed by this, and feel it should be clearly marked in the labeling of the book."
4,Enjoyed the Outside Perspective of Hornblower,"This book perks up considerably after the ""first"" installment of Midshipman Hornblower. Told from an outside perspective (which works admirably, thanks to a likable and relatable narrator), it zips along with high stakes, good action, and some worthwhile character development. Looking forward to the next in the series."
4,A great Historical naval story,"C.S. Forester created a superb naval drama that gave me an inside look at the life of a sailor serving in the Royal Navy on the wooden war ship Renown. With Hornblower, and his companion Bush dealing with their befuddled Captain and fighting off the attacks by the Spanish this book kept me reading page after page. I believe this is one of the best books in the Hornblower series and I would encourage anyone with an eye for historical novels to check this series out."
3,Slowly develops into an interesting followup to the first book,"This book is a weaker followup to the fast-paced Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, the first book in this series. The novel really picks up half-way into the book, but the first half is slow and doesn't carry the action that is included in the second half of the book. The final third of the novel is very interesting as it carries the most action and introduces the Maria character, as well as solidifying the relationship between Hornblower and Bush. Overall, I thought it was enjoyable but I was still a bit disappointed after reading the first novel, which I felt was incredible and filled with great action and solid writing."
3,"Cheap Shirts, but Worth It","These shirts are a bargain. But for this price, be warned that you are buying very light and thin shirts. I also had a problem with the shoulder seam and arm length. Compared to better quality shirts, the Cacharel seems longer than the stated size. I find that the 32/33 shoulder hangs lower than most of my 34/35's. It may just be me, but that's a oddity worth mentioning. While the quality is not the best, for this price, it's not a bad deal. Overall, I'm satisfied."
4,Good bargain for the money,"I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks. Something comparative at K&G would run between $15 and $20. It has a $45 tag on it, and I'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I'll but 5 more of them."
4,"A very moving historical novel on the famous ""Last Stand""","Having read a number of Custer books, and visited the sight twice anything on the bookshelf about this subject is an immediate purchase.The character development in the first half of the book took a while ( thus 4 rather than 5 stars) but once that was over the story was unraveled in very readable, interesting and fascinating style. The explanation of the deployment of the troops before the Last Stand was really well done and as good an explanation and description as I have read on the subject. This will not be the last book on the subject but it will surely rank as one of the best. Thanks for the epilogue. Great to know what happened to the people involved."
4,Triumphant!,"This book gives an excellent insight into Booker T's life. The unknowns, the lack of a childhood and the fear that existed then is unimaginable. This book gives inspiration to those who would be thinking of giving up."
5,American history,"I ordered this for my grandson, but this book is filled with history, history of those that have been forgotten, but have contributed so much to this society, which has produced such great black men like Obama. It if wasn't for them, he would've never achieved the accomplishments he has."
4,Required reading,"Wow! What an amazing story! It is fascinating to read Booker T. Washington's account of a childhood in slavery followed by his rise to national prominence as the founder of the Tuskegee Institute.While some may argue that Washington was naive and overly accomodating, I was amazed at his ability to forgive and see the best in people. He did not nurse grudges or let others bring him down. Whether or not you feel that he should have spoken up more for judicial equality, you have to admit that he was a strong, dedicated man of character.Everyone: white, black, brown, or any other shade, can benefit from reading the autobiography of this great American."
3,put it into context,"Rather than seeing just the one piece of the puzzle that is America's race relations history, invest instead in the larger Norton Anthology of American Literature or another compendium that has the Washington work excerpted with that of others from that and other periods. The knowledge of the greater context, in the speaker's (or writer's) own words is mind expanding."
3,Washington was a great politician,"I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told. Slavery was a lot harsher than Washington wrote it was, this book was too carefree in dealing with the harshness of slavery. He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money. He was the Benedict Arnold of the black folk."
3,Up From Slavery,"I read Up From Slavery in an African American Lit class, and was totally applauled by it. Washigton is so complaicent, the man was not even angry with white people for four hundred years of slavery. The debate between Washington and WEB DuBois is famous: Wash. wanted black people to forgive and forget and continue to be the southerners work dogs. DuBois wanted the negro race to embrace higher education and follow in the footsteps of wealthy Americans like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Which plan was better for uplifting a race? It depends upon which direction the country was going at the turn of the century."
2,Very boring!,"I thought this was supposed to be an autobiography! All he talks about is his school. He mentions his wife and kids only once or twice. I got the impression that he was a very selfish man. Plus, to top it off, the book was boring!"
2,It will put you to sleep!,"This book talks of slavery in a positive light. Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life."
5,Humbled,I decided to read this book while on vacation. The story of Booker Talliaferro Washington touched my heart. I am a 64 year old white man born in Booker T Washingtons home state of Virginia. It hurt me to think of that great man being a slave. A genius of his calibre cannot be held down. It is my wish that all people could read his story. I was humbled when I read this book. I wish that his legacy had endured more among the black population of this country. His message of hope through education and love of labor for its own rewards is a profound statement of love and commitment to his race. He is in my mind one of the greatest men who ever lived. God bless the man and his memory. Please read this book.
4,Build Our Own Everything,"This book taught: That African people should be educating themselves, African people should have their own industry, African people should be able to depend on themselves, and more."
4,This book was good!!,"I think Up from Slavery is a good book, its for all readers who want to learn about black heritage. Booker is a young man eager to learn and have a education. Washington was born in Virgina at a slave hut. Washington attended the school Hampton. In order for him to get in this fine school, he had to sweep and clean the speaking room, one day the superintendent came by with a white glove and ran her finger across every piece of furniture, no dust. The superintendent was so impressed she enrolled him at Hampton, this just lets you know how much he wanted to learn."
3,Booker T. Washington,Very interesting perspective on slavery from someone who actually lived through it. All slave tales are not alike.
5,Well-written story of an amazing man,"I knew next to nothing about Booker T. Washington prior to reading this book. Now I feel honored to have had his story shared with me. Despite the risk of sounding cliche, he has become an inspiration and hero to me. If not for his convictions and spirit, he would have been quite ordinary. Instead, he accomplished incredible goals, overcoming unimaginable feats, and has reached an inumerable amount of people, generation after generation. This book is a mainstay on my bedside table. Required reading for all."
3,name of product did not match product,"When I bought this book I was expecting the classic reprint of the book. Not a modern print, when I buy something off of Amazon I expect to receive what I ordered. I don't want a refund or anything like that, because the book got the job done. I just wish to express how much it means to customers to get what they order and not something else."
5,Read up on Booker T. Washington,"I greatly enjoyed this book! I admire Booker T. Washington for his endless pursuit of education. This book is a great inspiration to any student. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Mr. Washington did not get into his personal or family life. I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read."
3,UP FROM SLAVERY,"The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus THREE stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too."
2,Diet and Diabetes,"I watched then took it to my diet consultant at my Dr. She reviewed the research and found the vegitarian, no oil diet in the video has been tried and found lacking in validity in diabetes blood sugar control. My advice, see a diet specialist and stay with your local Dr. This video gives old advice."
2,So many paths to treating Diabetes,"There are numbers of opinions out there on what to do about Diabetes. DR, Barnard certainly is one of them and worth finding out about. I'm still sorting whether this is the way I should go.I think his claim that he has a ""Cure"", is hype and this discredits his main point, but I haven't dismissed it yet."
2,Tackling Diabetes with Dr. Neal Barnard,Not all that great! The first section was informative while the rest was a wASTE OF TIME UNLESS YOUR A VEGITARIAN
5,A Good Keepsake,"In the past, I have tried and tried to keep and journal and just didn't keep it. I would write in it for a few days and then forget to write in it. When my 13th birthday rolled around, my mom got me ""Dreams- A Notebook Journal"" and told me to try to keep it. Since my birthday, I have written in it everyday. I love the journal's design and how the pages look inside. I would recommend this to any young girl looking for a good journal to write their personal thoughts and dreams in."
5,Sexy and Irreverent,This is the sound of London's Sonic Mook Experiment club trying to outscuzz New York and LA and it works exceedingly well. Guitar feedback and perversity but never at the expense of danceability. Imagine Death in Vegas but less dirge-y and with a bit more squelchy electro fun at various tempos. It is unmixed.
1,One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read.,"Factually shaky at many points, pedestrian prose, self-aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing. What I found most offensive about this book was the author's egotistical disdain for the, ""lesser climbers"", of the team. In fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug, arrogant jerks. Having been on climbing expeditions before, there is a great deal of stress, raw feelings, etc, but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting. Don't even get started on their ugly American ""analysis"" of Asians on Denali.Read this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so."
1,Good bird cage lining,"I give this book one star because it made nice lining for my bird cage. Others have described, more eloquently than I can, why this is not a good book to read. I found the author mean, pompous and racist. As a climber of many years I can honestly say I would never tie into a rope with her."
2,New title for the book: Boredom on Denali,"I found the author to be overly dramatic and dreadfully overused tired cliches and crude, offensive language. She was absoulutely obsessed with outdoor urination and defication. The only redeeming quality to the book is it's meticulous description of the boredom of being trapped during a storm for days on end in a small frozen tent. She talks about being offended by people being interested in the deaths and gore, yet she endlessly talks about body bags, the removal of the dead Koreans, etc. If you want to know climbing from every conceivable angle, it's worth a read, but don't expect too much."
3,"Not a work of literature, but a good read","I don't disagree with the criticisms of her writing, but I have to admit that while I was reading the book, I found the story compelling. Yes, Into Thin Air was much better overall and much better written, but give the woman a break --it was still an interesting account and refreshing to hear from a female climber stuck in a male climbing world. For the hour or so it took me to read it, I did not develop any animosity towards the author and simply kept reading to find out what happens. And boy was I glad to be able to walk outside and get some sun when I finished."
2,Krakauer Lite,"I have to agree with others reviewers that Kocuour's ego is a huge obstacle in reading this book. I'm reminded of people who in conversation do nothing but bad-mouth others to compensate for their lack of confidence. Everyone else is weak, unrefined, stupid, or otherwise worth mocking. I'm stuck with the passage where she gets mocks a fellow climber who has brought a book to read about jet airplanes. That's the depth she goes to in her pettiness.The story itself is interesting and should be compelling, but getting past the author's tone soured the reading experience for me.I have many mountaineering books. Ones I'd heartily recommend are Joe Tasker and Peter Boardman's ""The Boardman Tasker Omnibus"", Jim Whittaker's ""A Life on the Edge"" and Peter Potterfield's ""In the Zone"". These authors not only write well, but can convey the challenges and trials of mountaineering without narcissism. These books all sit proudly in my bookcase. Kocuour's book is in a cardboard box in my basement."
1,"Don't Try This at Home, Kids...","This book would be a joke if it were not dangerous. There's nothing wrong with being guided on a mountain...in fact, it may be a comparatively safe way to enjoy an outdoor experience (and it keeps many climbers employed. There's also nothing wrong with writing about the experience of being guided...David Roberts, Jon Krakauer, and others have done that entertainingly and tastefully. But to title it ""the extreme...true courage...death-defying survival...a quest"" shows serious signs of self-delusion. I am most concerned that some innocent will pick this book up, enjoy it, and do something really stupid.Hint: If you liked this book...if you really found it exciting...stay home!(1 star, in honor of the book's value as kindling, and because there is no lower rating.)"
2,Best lesson learned,"Scrolling through the reviews of Facing The Extreme, it is easy to pick out, from their words, the type of climber I would choose to climb with and those I would not. Kocour's mean-spirited book clearly gives climbers and women a bad name In fact, the best lesson to be gleaned from the chronicle of this arrogant and self-serving woman is: choose your team members as carefully as possible whenever possible. The most insightful comment made by any of the reviewers was the one who said he would not want to be roped up to Ruth Anne Kocour. Who would?"
2,Amazing arrogance,"I agree with many of the other reviewers' criticisms of Kocour's writing style and her contemptuous attitude toward other climbers. I would add that for her to refer to her experience as ""extreme"" shows her complete lack of credibility as a climber. Ms. Kocour was bored, cold and scared, and her feet got cold -- that's all. Meanwhile, others died in the same storm. If you want to read about an ""extreme"" experience on Denali, try Davidson's Minus 148 or Waterman's In the Shadow of Denali. I also second those who recommended the Boardman-Tasker Omnibus."
2,I'm left feeling sour...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was quick paced and gripping. The problem was when I put it down... I felt sour -- like I'd been cooped up on a mountain with a bunch of bumbling idiots for three weeks... That was what stuck with me... Could that have been the whole point of the book??? To convey that??? Wasn't there something more important to convey? Like Kocour's experience with the mountain, or more importantly, with herself? I wonder if she feels sour, still..."
2,Laughing Aloud: One Reader's Story of True Hilarity and Boredom-Defying Perusal in the Face of Denali's Silliest Story Ever!,"The more you know about mountaineering, the funnier you'll find this book. There is little to like, but much to laugh at in Ruth Ann's utterly unselfconscious self-portrait.If this were a comic novel it would be a dead-on parody of a certain strain of self-glorifying mountaineering literature. Think Nicholson Baker writing ""Into Thin Air"" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman. And it starts with the twenty-two-word long title!Warning: if you're not in the mood to laugh, be prepared to be annoyed!"
4,An accurate portrayal - a fun read!,"Both my wife and I read this book in almost one sitting; it was very compelling. Her descriptions of the cold, the storm, and her relationships with the other climbers were right-on. This is the world of climbing as it exists today, and it gives excellent insite into the high-mountain disasters of recent history. I've climbed over 100 mountains higher than 11,000 feet--several of which were winter ascents and required technical ability. I'm not a professional mountain climber and I've never hired a guide. But I probably will hire a guide some day. To put this book down because the author isn't a full-time mountain climber is weak. I have a professional life outside of mountain climbing. That's the reality of modern climbing--is my experiance somehow less authentic because of that? This author was there, her writing is compelling, I enjoyed it immensely!"
2,Juvenille writing style.,"After reading Jon Krakauer's book, I had to have more! Unfortunately, I choose Ruth Ann Kocour's book, which reads like an account of a life-threatening adventure as told by an adolescent. Although she is not a journalist, her recounting of conversations do not ring true and all the ""voices"" sound alike. And while I appreciated some insight into how bodily functions are handled on the mountain, a more mature attitude would have gone a long way."
1,"Far too fundamentalist, with not enough Sun Tzu","I chose this book out of sheer desperation when I was looking for a good investment book on Holidays.This book is so far slanted toward a fundamentalist approach that I believe the author thinks Graham and Buffett are gods. It reads very poorly and the author could have imparted his message in less than a few pages.The author also denigrades all technical analysis with a few choice statistics that do not hold water very well.In my view this is a big let down, and I wish I could get my time and money back."
4,Useful book,This is a nice and interesting book. It combine Chinese wisdom with investment strategy. It is very helpful when you make investement decision.
4,great introduction to value investing,"In recent years I have been learning a lot about value investing as opposed to stock speculating. One of the books I've found most helpful in this process is this book from Curtis Montgomery. His application of the time tested ideas of Sun Tzu to the sometimes crazy world of investing is at times quite sublime. Filled with many examples from the real world of investing, this book is a great introduction to value investing."
5,Timeless Gems of Wisdom,"It's amazing how the reasoning and the tactics of an ancient Chinese warrior apply to the modern day stock investor. The battlefields are different but the strategies sre the same. The author makes these comparisons in an easy-to-read style. No wonder he's known throughout Asia as the ""Singapore Sage"". It is a fine piece of work."
5,Redheads Rock,"Marion Roach, NPR correspondent, is a redhead, and aims to get to the bottom of redhead mythology in our culture. She discusses the oldest famous redheads, like Lilith (Adam's pre-Eve wife in the bible), Set, and Mary Magdalene. She also gets into the genetics of red hair, and explains why it's rare. She also discusses the historical attributes associated with red hair through time. It was formerly thought that Jews were redheads, and later, that redheads were not to be trusted. More currently, red hair is associated with sexual prowess and a hot temper. This book is a fun and intellectually satisfying read, especially for redheads."
4,interesting read,"i actually got this book as a replacement for a friend whose book i borrowed and accidentally destroyed the cover, so now i have her old copy. im not a red head, but she recommended the book so i read it. i dont really like the author's tone, though thats more of a personal preference. it is very interesting and easy to read, so it was easy for me to look past the fact that i found the author to be a bit annoying."
1,don't bother,I was given this book as a gift and as a redhead myself I was excited to read it. All I can say is that I am glad I did not pay good money for it. The writing is so bad and pointless and does nothing to prove a point or even tell a story. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!
1,agree,"Agree with NY red, skip it. Half the book is personal ""Deep Thoughts"" and the other half stuff about red hair you could already read on the web for free."
2,what a waste of paper,"This is an absolute waste of paper and money. There are very few interesting facts, historical or other wise, about redheads in this book. It is mostly overly wordy personal anecdotes of the author.Let me stress the overly wordy part.I'm still looking for that book that I had hoped this one was...you know the one about the myths, beliefs, facts, etc of redheads...of which I am proudly one..."
1,Don't bother,I was excited to receive this book. I am a red head and have an infant son with red hair too. This book was very boring. I hung in there hoping it would get better but soon found myself skipping pages. It did not hold my interest and didn't seem to make much sense. I have a red headed girlfriend that I was going to pass it on to but after reading it I have changed my mind. The cover is attractive so therefore it makes a good coffee table book.
2,I was disappointed,"I also was really looking forward to reading this book but had to force myself to finish. As a redhead, I feel armed with some more knowledge about the history of redheads but was left... hanging, somehow.I found it disjointed and it was not an enjoyable read."
4,interesting read,"I learned a bit about redheads--not as much as I would have liked to, but it was well written"
2,couldn't finish it,"As a redhead, I bought this book hoping to get some coherent info about redheads throughout history. Honestly, I put the book down a while ago and haven't been able to pick it back up. There's something about the way that Ms. Roach writes that feels like eating cotton candy all day - it's vacuous without much substance. She flows into tangent after tangent, with moments of wit, and then fails to deliver any ""final knowledge.""As far as any allegations of an anti-christian nature to the book, well, it's called superstition, and christians weren't exempt from that, however much they would try to deny it. Ms. Roach does discuss witch meetings, so if you're threatened by that, stay away.Overall, not worth the money."
2,Was she serious?,"Since I have a red-headed daughter, this sounded lioke a fun book to read. I gave it up just about 1/3 of the way through. Maybe it got better but I wasn't going to stay around to find out. The author really stretched it to make her point. Her point? Maybe becasue she's a redhead, she wanted to be so very, very special, so she took a few supposed facts and made a whole concept from them. Come on! Trying to make redheads all some sort of special witches, monmsters, super-human people was dumb. And she totally dissed red-headed men. My husband read it through but we both quickly decided NOT to send it to our daughter."
5,Great book for boys!!!,I loved this book when I was in 3rd grade and now I am reading it to my 2nd and K. They love it too! Every night we read 2 chapters so we got through it in less then a week. Now I have little inventors running all around the house. Should pay dividends come science fair time!Charlie
5,My library fees on this one are outrageous,This is the one that started it all for me. The most exciting book about a smart kid you will ever find. It's been overdue ...for a long time.
4,"Hey, I remember this!","The description of another Hicks / Alvin book elsewhere mentioned his sister Daphne, known as ""the pest"", and that triggered childhood memories. I started searching on the author and the character, and I recognized this title.I had this book, and loved it. I got one of the rocket engines described and duplicated his rocket running along a cable device. I believe I played with other ideas mentioned in this book (does this have the bed maker? I think it's this book).I don't think I still have it, so maybe I'll have to get a new copy. At least now I know where to look on my bookshelves! And I'll have to try some of the others. I had several experiences with kid's book series I only saw small parts of as a kid that I've enjoyed later."
4,Mission Style Coffee Table,"The table came about 2 days BEFORE the posted delivery date. That was a plus. It was easy to assemble, did it by myself within 30 minutes. Instructions was clear. The quality was very good not the best but for the price it was worth it. All solid wood construction. The only thing that I saw that could have been better was the sie screws/bolts that held the legs onto the lower frame. The holes were not recessed therefore the tops of the screws were visable and were not quite all the way flush with the frame. Not a big problem and most people would not notice it. Overall a very good product at a very reasonable price."
4,Excellent table for the price,"I was happy to receive more or less what I was looking for -- a cheap, solidly constructed table that looked exactly like the item pictured. Clearly this isn't a top-of-the-line table, but it looks like it does in the pictures and doesn't wobble or feel like it might collapse if you sat something on it. In short, it doesn't much stand out one way or the other (neither an amazing piece of artistic-furniture nor a cheap-looking accent piece), which is exactly why I like it. The table is delivered in a thin, squarish box and requires a little bit of assembly, but it'll take you about 5 minutes to throw together so it's definitely not exactly difficult or intensive to assemble."
5,Great cherry table,"As others had said, this table is CHERRY. I bought it because I needed a larger table for my walnut chess board and the woods do not match at all -- though the table matches my cherry bookshelves perfectly (which is what I was hoping for from the other reviews). If you order from Amazon directly the packaging will be second to none and the table will arrive quickly.My only complaint was one little chip on the inside of one leg, but it's well hidden. This is a great product and you should buy without hesitation."
5,Stanford Mission Coffee Table,"Love the table it is very well made and sturdy. The first shipment had to be sent back because the apron was lined up incorrectly. That was a hassle, as well as it took me over 3 months to receive the table in the first place (they had trouble locating it in the warehouse). But I am very pleased with the actual table! It is far more beautiful than the pictures depict. Beautiful wood and very elegant. Very easy assembly."
5,solid golden oak but white as veneer..!,"before you order, make sure this is the color you want. if you order ""golden oak"", it is not the real golden oak, or at least this is not what I think is golden oak. the moment i opened the box, I was like, oh.. no! the top is like the veneer (yellowish white). so, i have to return and order the honey oak. in terms of quality, construction and assembly, it is great. putting the top part of the table is kinda tricky, so it took time. i was able to assemble in 10 mins, being a man with handyman inclination. you just need the right hexa-keys. but real solid and no compromise with the quality. this is exactly the quality I was looking for to adore the living room. thanks amazon for the super hassle-free return policy.then I got the honey oak that exactly mathced my other furnitures and even the wood-flooring in my dining area. wow! beautiful looking table with a solid quality. adds great value to our living room!"
4,Chipped Beauty,"The product itself is beautiful and sturdy, but due to rather iffy packaging, the finish was chipped off in a NUMBER of places. It makes me worry about how it'll hold up looks wise with three active toddler boys, a dog and a cat. Over all though, it's VERY sturdy and looks great for the price!"
4,Great!,Great bicycle sized nalgene. I bought it thinking it was a 32oz. but it turned out it fit perfectly in my bike water bottle holder.
2,Beware of false contouring,"I have had the TV for two weeks. The picture quality is very inconsistent. It ranges from completely fantastic to unwatchable. For me, the most annoying problem is that the TV over processes images to create lot of artifacts. Human skin can look very unnatural and pixelated.I don't know if I got a poor sample or it is endemic to Samsung TVs. Some posters on avsforum have reported the same problem.Buy at a local store so you can return it, there is a good chance that you might not like it."
1,never received this item,"This order was part of a major scam. I never received it and the ""seller"" emailed me to send him cash to a particular account so that he could ship the item. I blew up his email and contacted amazon to wipe the order. No money exchanged. Surprised this item showed up (6 years later) as an item I had purchased. Learned to be careful of the too good to be true offers on Amazon."
3,Horrible,"I had this tv for 4 months before it started acting up. It would turn off on its own at random times, then lines started forming across the screen."
4,Check the specs.,FYI. Note that this description doesn't match the manufacturer's. The Samsung website states that this model has a 10 speaker (2-way) sound system with 15-Watts per channel for a total of 30-Watts. I didn't get clarification with their customer department.
3,Expected more...,"I was anticipating more forward thinking solutions to the home organization problem. I was not, however, disappointed with the photographs. Having recently purchased the Lighting Design Sourcebook by Wilhide, I knew, at the very least I would be getting some beautiful photos. The book is broken down into areas of the home (kid's rooms, living spaces...)and attacks each one separately offering ""stylish"" storage solutions. This book is clearly aimed at the homeowner looking to throw out the cardboard closet organizer and add a built-in, not the professional designer looking to supplement a design library with novel storage design resolutions."
2,It's okay.....,"I really wanted to love this moisturizer! I have very fair, sensitive skin, and this was supposed to be one of the best bets for my skin type. It also has a great high SPF.But, alas it does not sink into my skin. It does not blend well at all. It leaves a terrible white residue that takes forever to rub in.Maybe because of the high SPF? I am not sure,but I was definitely disappointed."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this product because of the stellar reviews, but this product turned out to be TERRIBLE. When you apply this product to your face, it doesn't absorb into your skin...it just sits there and leaves you with a white mask. And who would go out in public wearing a white mask on their face?!?!?! For some reason no one mentioned that on here, but if you go to other websites (drugstore,com- I can't use a period because they might remove the link) and read this products reviews you will see what I'm talking about. Trust me when I say do not waste your money on this product; Neutrogena's Ultrasheer sunblock is the best sunblock for your face out there."
4,Best In Class,"I've used this product for years. I'm fair and with one morning application, I'm able to spend the entire day outdoors in the southern CA sun. Some great things about this product is that it doesn't sting like some other sunscreens, it has a good consistency (not thick or greasy), lasts a really long time, and really works.The only downside is that it makes a fair one like myself look somewhat pasty. It is a white lotion and leaves a bit of a white finish. I really wish Eucerin would market a tinted version."
2,"Love Eucerin, but this one dried white and sticky","I tested this product on my arms for a week. It dried sticky, and this caused me to be very itchy. I ended up stratching up my arms, but after I stopped using this product, my arms started to clear back up. But, still have some scarring. I think I will go back to the original Eucerin that dried clear, and didn't leave any residue."
4,A Little More Effort.....,"I enjoyed this book for the most part, having read it several years ago. I was not only disappointed but surprised at the lack of research that resulted in the remark that in the United States, Southerners evidently believed that shooting at a tree with mistletoe would cause the plant to fall to the ground. In the most exact sense that is true: mistletoe grows at the top of tall oak trees, and actually shooting it down is the easiest and safest way to obtain it; not some ""whammy"" ignorant people use to obtain a desired object. I think a little more work would have resulted in a little less disdain."
5,Wonderful Guide to forming your own traditions,My family was looking to develop our own traditions and to understand why traditions where as they are today. This book was a wonderful source.
5,Superior product,"This beefy book will provide me with a wealth of info each year as I weave a Solstice celebration into my busy holiday schedule. Getting back to my Scandinavian ancestral heritage is important to me as I age, and this book is a thoroughly researched and comprehensive tool for observing this special event."
4,Help with Solstice,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about the traditions of Winter Solstice and how they related to American Christmas. To that end it was great. It had way more than I needed so I did skip sections but for someone wanting more history than I needed, I'm sure they'd find it fascinating."
2,Wait for the new edition !,"While this book on nutritional biochemistry was adequate when it came out in 1999, much has changed in seven years. Without an update of the way daily allowances are now determined, new findings in the area of molecular biology, etc. the potential buyer may be rewarded by waiting for the next edition. It is interesting to note that most of the reviews came from the author."
3,Why not much customer review?,"At time of writing, majority of listed reviews are written by the author himself. I would be really interested in this book should the reviews come from some real name readers."
1,"This is a joke, right?","The book is so painfully simplistic, it looks as though it was made in one sitting. How could we possibly insult our children by making them think they're THIS ignorant?One child was swift to point out, ""Does Larry have a last name, too? Or is he sharing the last name of Lilly? As in 'Harry and Lily Potter' do?And I had no choice but to confirm that yes, there is indeed a reason why these books are so.. uh... disturbing. They're related. And happily dating.Btw, the first book, ""Larry Potter and his best friend Lilly..."" you can clearly see in the book cover that Lilly, for a best friend, is a little too snug on the ""personal space"" touching. Even Ron wouldn't be caught in that pose with Harry and they're REAL best friends! So does that cover count as a spoiler? Cause for some strange reason ""More than just friends"" was more of a joke than a surprise. .Glad it was borrowed and not bought.And grats on little Kathrine smart enough to figure out the mystery behind the nonsense! <3"
1,A sad waste of time.,"My cousin bought this book to read to his young sons. I decided to read it first before he did.At first I thought it was going to be all right. But as I started to read the story. I found that it was flat and not moving like you would have thought. Plus the title itself states sexual possiblities between Lilly and Larry Potter.Now don't get me wrong here, More than just friends is a term that most older adults would use for their 'sexual partners' who are not married to them. If I told my friend that I'm more than just friends with so and so person, the first thing that comes to their mind is oh she's having sex with him.I didn't read past the first three pages which is more than I did with the other books, I returned the book to my cousin and told him return it for a refund or an exchange of another book that is worth your time to read to your sons.Don't waste your money on this book it's not worth it."
1,not worth any money,you may not take me seriously because i am a teenager but i am a big fan of the harry potter books. larry potter pails in comparison to harry potter and basically any other book it also uses similar termonoilgy and is a copycat that is why i even brought up harry potterso dont waste your time reading this book life isnt long enough
3,Not bad for what it is.,"I came down very hard on ""N.K."" Stouffer's work in another review, so here I'll give her a small amount of credit. This isn't a great book, but for what it is -- a simple book aimed at very young readers -- it isn't bad. Young children might enjoy guessing what relation Larry and Lilly are to each other, and the book is actually a good deal better than the atrocious ""The Legend of Rah and the Muggles."" I didn't love the illustrations, but children might not be so fussy.It probably goes without saying that Larry and Lilly Potter aren't wizards and bear no resemblance whatsoever to Harry and Lily Potter, but if you're looking for a fun book for a beginning reader this isn't a terrible choice. Stouffer should stick to writing for this market."
1,WHAT KIND OF HUMAN WOULD ENJOY THIS BOOK?,This book was a monumentous waste of anyones time. It could've been possibly the worst book i've ever read. This book is supposed to be for kids? The kids themselves could of written a better story than this piece of junk! Take my advice- save a tree and ditch this terrible book!
4,I generally don't go for books of this type....,"But when all things are considered the book is not really that bad, in fact certain quotes are very uplifting. I would rather read this then one of the 5 thousand Chicken Soup for the Souls any day of the week."
2,Remarkably lacking in content...,"This books presents itself as a helpful guide to programmers, promoters, and everyday jocks for programming improvement. Surprisingly, the book was primarily based on author Quincy McCoy's own journey through the ranks in radio and his personal trials along the way. McCoy's story, albeit a testament of his talent, unfortunately lacks a great deal of content for those who are looking for a ""book of good radio ideas"". A better choice for today's programming staff, in more encyclopedic form and coming from another radio guru, isRadio: The Book, Fourth Editionby Steve Warren."
4,"Some Substance, mostly filler","A great read with some helpful tips for neophytes. This book offers some ideas that would be beneficial to someone just starting or about to start a radio career. If you have a few years experience, this book will tell you little information that you haven't read in industry magazines. For those obsessed with radio it is still worth buying because it chronicles an amazing career."
4,Not too shabby. . .,"Album editing is a terrible terrible thing. Sometimes it can lead to an amazing song sounding horrible (i.e. Capleton Pure Sodom version on More Fire) and on Thug Nature it reigns supreme. Songs like the opener Coochie Daddy and Buck a Catty are nearly destroyed by the record company's torrid display of editing. However, if you set the editing aside, which is terribly difficult to do, you end up with a pretty good record from the now veteran Spragga. Apparently Spragga set out to make a straight head knocking dancehall album, and he succeeded in doing just that. Check out ""Analogy"" on the Superstar, also used by the following track ""Bait"", ""Stunna"" and ""Di Rooster"". My personal favorite is ""Playa"" with one of the wickedest rhythms I've heard in a long time. Overall, if you can get past the editing its a very good album, definitely worth buying if you're a Benz fan, or maybe if you're a hip-hop fan that is starting to listen to dancehall."
5,Very Nice!,"The other reviews helped me decide to purchase this item. I was not disappointed. I am pleased with the quality, and particularly like the large bale on the back that enables you to use a thicker chain."
1,Maximum NO Doubt SUXXXX!!!,"DON'T BUY! NOT EVEN FOR A PENNY!! I'm a #1 No Doubt fan and this cd totally sucked!! I bought it because I thought I stumbled onto something rare. It has nothing to do with the band, just heresay and nothing at all interesting! an english lady reads it and there's no NO Doubt music at all. It wasn't even written by no doubt and it contains no real info just when their albums came out and what label. I buy EVERYthing that's no doubt and I wouldn't spend a dollar on it!!"
1,not very good..,i could only read an hour of this poor paraphrase. ive read many paraphrases and this is one of the worst.
5,Robin of Sherwood Review,Fun series. I used to watch it growing up and I found it incredible that I was able to find the whole series on DVD! Thank you Amazon.com
2,Somewhat boring and childish,"I bought this based on the reviews. Upon viewing the first few episodes, I found the stories to be boring, silly in spots, and lacking in reality. The characters comprising Robin's little band seem to be a little dense and bumbling. Scenes of people sitting around accompanied by music playing are not appealing to me. I intend to watch the rest and certainly hope the stories improve."
1,Not translated very well for Kindle,I am in no way knocking the author's writing. Whoever transfered this book did not do a good job. The story is disjointed and when turning the page does not match up with what was just read. From what I can make of this story it was good andnot a long read. Of course i have no idea how much is missing.
3,Not for the average traveller,"It contains less information as it is thinner. It is organized more like documentary than guides, as you have your own transportation and go for trekking for days into the wildernss in both Chile and Argentina. It doesn't have the info of the popular tourist towns, accomdations and excursion operators. I bought also the Footprint and Rough Guide for the 40 days backpack trip mainly in Argentina in Dec 2007. They complementing each other and I personally like the Footprint. Email tenny52@yahoo.com if you want to know more about the trip."
4,WWE Night Of Champions 2010 review,"The Dolph Ziggler-Kofi Kingston-IC title match while not a good bout, it was still better then their bout at SummerSlam a month back. The Bout between The Big Show & CM Punk was one-sided but sweet. The United States title match between Daniel Bryan & The Miz was a entertaining,back-and-forth,high-tech match of the night. The Melina-Michelle McCool-Title Unification-LumberJill match was not great but pretty good. The No Holds Barred match for the World's title was a smash-mouth,hard-hitting brawl. The Tag Team Turmoil match for the Tag Team titles was a lousy,clustered filler. The 6 Pack Elimination match for the WWE title was a entertaining,hard-hitting,smash-mouth,double-teaming,brawling bout. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10."
5,works like a charm,"The installation of drivers for this card was easy, and I now have easy access to firewire and USB 2.0 on my notebook. There is an optional AC adapter available for this product, but for use on my desk, I just use a firewire/USB hub combo that is powered. I have nine hardware devices daisy-chained from this card to powered hubs with no problems at all. It is recommended to only use one USB port at a time unpowered, such as on the road. I don't expect to need more than that if I'm mobile."
3,"Worked right off the bat, but...","Pros: Worked right off the bat (computer: ibm laptop from the 2000s currently running XP) -- did not need to install any special software.Cons: Resulted in my computer hanging intermittently, while operating my usb device.Disclaimer: This may be because I was connecting to a custom built circuit board with a usb 2.0 interface (requiring very high data transfer rates), and may be no fault of the card. I haven't tried this with other cards, but the very fact that this one worked off the bat was surprising and somewhat gratifying."
3,A few devices (only) works perfect,"I have bought this piece for my notebook that had all of its USB 2.0 ports spoiled with mostly broken power connections.The only things that work with this adapter for me are my printer, a few memory sticks (not all) and nothing more. The power wire that comes along with this adapter is useless for me because the power cable tries to derive power from my already present USB port of the notebook. Since that USB power port is broken, there is no way I can make sure that the adapter gets enough power.I have returned this product.So, I suggest you first identify what exactly is the problem with ur USB port (power/port itself) and then get this one."
1,Very disappointed,"This was an adorable bird feeder that was supposed to deter squirels, but it didn't sending the feeder crashing to the ground."
1,"Poorly made, don't bother...","Don't waste your money with this bird feeder - I purchased it because I thought it was cute and the price was right - but they should pay me for using it. It's very poorly made, hard to fill, cheap materials, etc., etc., I think you get the point."
3,"Many positives, but some negatives as well.","Buyer beware: movie-making is not (and was not, at the time of filming) a Russian strength. Image quality is mediocre, and the ""special effects"" (of which there are fortunately few) gave me a headache. On occasion, a dancer would be out of focus. On the other hand, the technical level of the dancing was very good, which made the DVD a worthwhile purchase, after all. I enjoyed the performance of the Prince, found Rothbart's idiosyncratic arm motions a bit annoying (although was amused by his sly interaction with the Prince's mother), and overall found the corps to be very disciplined."
1,"Disappointing, not helpful for traders at all","A few years ago I redHow To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad, 3rd Editionwhich was one of the best books on investing in stocks I've ever red. The author of that book mentionned he had over 2,000 books in his investment library with only a few very good books. He gave a list of 10 books he found best, which I've all red. Most of them were very good books (certainly for someone like me with some 150 books on investing). Books likeHow I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock MarketorReminiscences of a Stock Operator (Wiley Investment Classics)were all superb books. This was one of only books I had not red from the list. So I ordered it and began reading it with high expectations. As you can see in my rating, I did not like it all. To be honest I find the whole book one mess. I cannot even imagine how anyone could get anything useful for his/her trading out this book. I don't have a clew why O'Neill liked this one so much."
2,a good review,"although written decades ago, its still has some good info. Not a book for beginning independent investors. more for someone that has been trading awhile and likes a refresher course. a good read in all."
2,Didn't realize it was a single!,I didn't look carefully and didn't realize this was only the single...a good live track of Hey Man Nice Shot but I had intended to get the whole album
5,Great comforter for the value price!,Not bad for a down alternative - color matches the color scheme in bedroom - nice olve color - nice sheen to it - looks expensive.
4,Very nice collection of hard to find Eliza songs,"I've been an Eliza fan since I first heard her sing ""Hard Times in Babylon"" and I thought I had every album she'd done. ""Retrospecto"" is an excellent collection of hard to find songs. What drew me to the CD was ""Wild Horse"" which also appears on a Putumayo CD ""Women's Work."" When I realized there were 19 other songs here, I grabbed the collection. I'm quite pleased.Favorites include:Wild Horse--luminous, you can almost see the wild horse of the singer's dreamsBuffalo Gals--great fun cowgirl songHer Melancholy Muse--beautiful pianoThis is maybe not the best introduction to Eliza. I'd think about ""Hard Times in Babylon,"" ""Beautiful World"" or perhaps ""Land of Milk and Honey"", but this is still a great CD if you know her work and love her voice.Rebecca Kyle, July 2009"
3,Informative but little file footage,"The cover of this item may have one believe that a major part of the documentary contains material sourced at the time.This is not the case and the product is in the main present day interviews. I'm not saying that this provides any less impact of the terrible situation, but purchasers should be aware of this."
4,Great watch...,"I ordered this watch back in 2006. I wore it every day for the last 6 years and it had many hours in the pool/water and close to 100 dives on it, with one dive as deep as 137 feet back in 2008. Awesome watch. However, the last time I took it in to have the battery changed, the jeweler (I guess) didn't put it back together correctly and it flooded 2 weeks ago. So, it is no longer working. Although I did love this watch and it's smaller size (I'm not a large male with big wrists) I am going to purchase an automatic watch this time so I don't have rely on jewelers to change out the battery."
1,No 2.2mm Hex Nut Driver,"I should have read the reviews; especially the one from Gary E. Landrum ""3rd Camaro"". There is no hex driver. The nut driver tip is not reversible as it would appear to be from the description and the picture. This is my first one star on anything but the tool is useless to me (I needed the 2.2 mm hex nut driver) and it is being misrepresented."
3,Not a very complete set,This set only has two of the five sizes commonly found on today's rimless eyeglasses. Not a very complete rimless wrench nut driver set.
5,This thing is great!,"I have always one issue or another with my glasses and tiny screws. This thing is awsome. Got essentially all the precision drivers that you might need, unless you have a fairly exotic frame (I got some form Germany, Japan, USA and Denmark, it works on all)."
1,Still looking for a hex nut tightener.,"It must be me! This is the second purchase of mine to find something to tighten the hex nut on my reading glasses. The nutdriver is too big for the nut.(The same was true for the other key chain product I bought) I currently use a tweezers to tighten them, which does scratch the glass by the base of the nut. I won't try a third time....I'll use the tweezers."
5,piano bundled with piano teacher,"I bought two of these as gifts to musically talented children in the Ukraine and Belarus, because I wanted to deliver a self teaching piano. This is a wonderful keyboard, capable of teaching a very wide variety of songs to a beginning student."
1,SNL downloads on amazon.com,"Amazon.com doesn't tell you whether or not any of the episodes you purchase contain the music performances, no matter how much i liked. i primarily downloaded the episode because i wanted the MUSICAL PERFORMANCES, not the rest of the show! I finally downloaded the episodes and i can confirm that it does not contain any of the music performances on that particular episodes, which is a great disappointment."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE! Item is MISSING sketches.,"This video is missing one of the funniest SNL sketches of the episode, ""Monex"" the fact that NBC Universal has deleted content from this episode should be CLEARLY marked so you know what you're getting. Additionally, it should not be priced as high if they're removing content. What's up with NBC preventing people from seeing this sketch? Did they get sued by Monex?"
1,Missing content,"This episode is missing the Kristen Wiig gold commercial parody. I don't know why it got edited out, but it's not there. Don't buy this."
4,"Great movie, but transfer is not the best","I love this movie and could watch it many times. It includes the best part of an earlier Harold Lloyd movie, the football scene from The Freshman. There is also a wonderful scene where he hangs from a lion off the side of a building.The only thing wrong with this DVD is that the transfer is not the best. The video and sound quality could be better, but is not horrible like the Milky Way DVD from the same company."
5,Jason Nevins does it again!,"Can Mr. Nevins do no wrong? His remixes for Elvis, The Blackout All-Stars, Kelly Clarkson, and Madonna have been wonderful, and he continues this tradition with Anastacia.1. Left Outside Alone (Radio Edit) (10/10, 3:59): Great.2. Get Ready (Album Version) (9.9/10, 3:33): Eh. An entertaining, but forgettable, track. She cusses a lot too.3. Left Outside Alone (J. Nevins Global Edit) (11/10, 3:49): Awesome rock-flavored mix.4. Left Outside Alone (J. Nevins Global Club Mix) (11/10, 8:10): Takes awhile to get started, but still AWESOME!!!5. Left Outside Alone (Jason Nevins Mixshow) (2000/10, 5:31): The absolute BEST remix he's ever done. More of a tribal feel than the others.Buy this if you love remixes or are an Anastacia fan. You won't be disappointed."
4,Cunning Linguist makes the purchase worthwhile,"Ann odd assortment of songs and impressions. There is one stand out, the utterely incredibly edifying and majikal Necromancing the Cunning linguist by Gene Loves Jezebel (Who are a Triple X records band I beleieve?). It's truly bewitching and I for one am intrigued. There's something ELSE going on here and I want to learn more. The rest of the CD is insignifigant in this company but not without charm."
5,Adzuki beans,"Adzuki ( or Azuki) beans are ment to be used in asian sweets. You can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for 30-40 min, (changing the water out at least twice) draining and mashing the beans with sugar.(strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins) What you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream, fill pasteries or stuff into Mochi Cakes."
3,Good but not complete,"This might be a good CD to buy if you are not sure you even like the genre of music, but otherwise go with the complete 2-disk set. They left out some very good songs in 'Highlights'. The extra 10 or 20 dollars spent WILL be worth it,"
1,BUY THE COMPLETE CD!,"I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS CD AT BORDERS YESTERDAY AND I COULDN'T FIND IT. I REMEMBERD IT BEING LIKE 22 DOLLORS OR SOMETHING. SO I BOUGHT THE 35 DOLLOR COMPLETE 2 DISK RECORDING. I AM SOOOOOOO GLAD I DID. THERE WERE SO MANY GOOD SONGS THAT WERE ON THE COMPLETE CD THAT THEY TOOK OUT FOR THE HIGHLIGHTS. IF YOU REALLY LIKE EVITA AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A GOOD RECORDING, GET THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL BROADWAY OR THE CONCEPT RECORDING. I WOULDN'T BUY THIS OR EVEN THE ORIGINAL LONDON CD. THEY'RE JUST TOO SHORT."
4,Stats made fun,"Years ago I heard from someone taking a statistics class that this book was required but strangely entertaining and reasonably priced for a book on statistics.I needed to understand some statistics that have been thrown my way so I got the book. It explains statistics in clear, easy-to-understand language and has very entertaining cartoons to show examples.One example: It shows a mythical company and lists the salaries of every employee. Then it asks: ""Are you an employee who wants to argue pay is too low or the boss, who wants to argue pay is too high?"" It then shows that whethere you use an oveall average, an average between the highest and lowest pay, or a median pay will make the pay appear different--one method makes it look high, one makes it look low. Very, very interesting.Also entertaining, but probably not meant to be is the fact that having been written in the 1950's, the pay scale examples are very low. ($2,000 a YEAR?) Just add a zero to everything."
2,Not mind blowing at all,"Maybe I expected too much from this book. I thought this book could give me more insight into the dangers of statistical interpretations or the wrongful use of statistics. This book didn't help me at all with that. It's all very (very) basic stuff people should watch out for, when using statistics. Most of this I already knew. I think for anybody who has already red a book from Nicholas Taleb (or anything alike) this book will not present any new material.To people completely new to statistics, this book might be helpfull, but to those who frequently use statistics for their jobs or in their free time, this book won't add any value. There are much better books on statistics out there."
2,Statistics,The information was presented in simple language for the non-statistician. It was helpful to consider how statistics are presented and how they can be interpreted. The examples were outdated.
1,"Informative of media tactics, but not statistically accurate","It's a cute book, although utterly misleading. The Atlantic wrote: ""A pleasantly subversive little book, guaranteed to undermine your faith in the almighty statistic.""The fact of the matter is that when proper, statistically sound data gathering and analysis methods are employed, the statistics not only do not lie, but they also reveal the nature and extent of the errors inherent in the results.I know - among other things, I'm a professsional statistician.In fact, it was my profession in statistics that steered me into network analysis, which is a statistician's dream world. Large corporations must figure out where the bottlenecks reside, and how to combat them in the most cost-effective, time-valued, long-term manner.To do this properly, it takes an individual who knows Finance, Statistics, and Networks.Bottom lie: Statistics themselves don't lie. However, the improper use of statistics can lead to erroneous conclusions."
5,A necessity for everyone,"I graduated college in 1961 with an engineering degree from a highly rated school. A required non-engineering course was economics. I remember very little from that class except for a little red book authored by someone named Huff and that that book was one of the most enjoyable and educational books from my whole college career. [After an exhaustivesearch for the book, I found it and] I grabbed it! This book has saved me untold dollars by teaching me to look at most statistics with a very jaundiced eye and to laugh at most commercials. I just put my copy in with the materials I use to teach a class at a local community college since I expect that we [will be able to use the book to discussvarious issues related to current day politics.] I am also ordering several copies for gifts including one for my college freshman grandaughter. So what if the author states that a Yale graduate is doing well at an annual salary of $24,000. Everything else is current."
5,Should be Required Reading!,"""How to Lie with Statistics"" should be required reading before allowing anyone in today's world to call themselves an adult. And, yes, there should be strict testing for understanding this book before anyone is allowed to leave public (or private) schools and take part in real life.This book shows some of the ways media such as newspapers, TV, internet, etc. decieve you. Besides the media (especially advertisers); politicians, lawyers, and all sorts of other folks behave like confidence men and try to get your money, your trust, your vote, and your beliefs.IMMUNIZE YOURSELF! Read this book. Buy this book. Study this book. Memorize this book!This book will help you avoid the crooked people."
5,Classic introduction to the topic,"This is a classic introduction to the language of statistics and how a few well placed numbers/graphs/terms can distort reality. I use this as a supplementary reading for my undergrad students and they love it. It helps to clarify why language, numbers, and representations are so dangerous."
5,A great read and educational too!,"I currently teach statistics in Cincinnati, Ohio. The book How to lie with statistics held my attention from beginning to end. It not only informs the reader of common pitfalls in statistical studies, but it does so in a highly entertaining fashion. I believe that my students will enjoy the book, and I hope that they will start to enjoy statistics as well. The book was written some time ago and the figures are very outdated. I believe my students will find that amusing and will be even more interested in the reading."
4,How to Lie with Statistics,"The author in this book discuss little stories about ancient statistics that may or maynot be true. It's an interesting book with many photos to illustrate the sense of statistics and it's easy to read you can finish it in a day or too depending on your time. Very thin book with only 128 pages, I was able to fit it right into my pocket book with no problems. It's a very good book belive it or not I had to do a paper on it which was easy because the book give me plenty of ideas and examples to use which help me complete my project."
5,how to catch errors in statistics both the malicious and innocent kind,"How to lie with Statistics covers all the uses of statistics through a hit list of it's abuses. By covering how to lie with statistics the author teaches both awareness of misleading statistics and also the basics of this branch of mathematics. It is amazing how subtle a misleading statistic can be. For example there are many types of averages, the mean median and mode. In some cases they produce different results so a statistics compiler can choose the one favorable to him or her. I hoped to get a birds eye view of statistics from this book so as to improve my awareness of the constant abuse of statistics that occurs in the media. I believe I got that and more out of this book."
4,How to lie with statistics,"I have just finish reading this book and, in my opinion, I thought that it is a very simple and funny whey to learn statistic.However, for people who intend to purchase something with more details about tests and analyses, I don't recommend this book."
5,How to Lie with Statistics,"It was great! I know the author's daughter, and she really wanted a copy of her father's book. So it was nice to get a great copy of the book."
4,Entertaining,"Well written, if maintaining a 1950s style. I personally didn't learn much from this as a math-geek, but it was fun to read. I'll eventually have my teen read it."
3,"Outdated and general, but still useful","If you are looking for a very general overview of some of the more mundane misuses of statistical data to prove a particular point, then this is a useful book. Since it is 50 years old, though, you won't find any up to date illustrations of the title topic."
4,Dated but still useful,"The book is written in a highly readable format, with a wry sense of humor in the narrative. At the same time book clearly feels quite dated when talking about 20's and 30's. I do think the reporting is not as bad anymore as it is described about the newspaper of early to mid 20th century.At the same time, you will most likely run into such statistical jiggering in water hole topics and on channels like FOX. This books shows you how to critically all such information and take most of aggregated information and surveys with a grain *or mountain) of salt."
3,Interesting,"This short essay is really interesting, even if it relies much more above use that humans make of statistics than above statistics itself. You can deceive people by presenting statistical data by mainly two methods: not representative samples and inaccurate calculations, and both are fairly, but not deeply, examined within the text. You can easily realize that the book was written in 1954 (half a century ago!), but it is still a suitable to almost absolute beginners in statistics."
2,Seriously watered down,"There is nothing in this book that you won't find in a begining statistics course. The author gives lots of definitions of the most commonly used words and then provides examples. The reading is light and easy and sometimes amusing. However, it is a flimsy paperback made from low quality paper. There are LOTS of typos in this book. Definitely not worth $12."
4,"Great, but not up-to-date",This is a great book. It does however have at least one SERIOUS short coming. The figures are very out of date. It would be nice if the examples were taken from the 90's or at least the 80's. Most of the statistics in this book are from the 40's and 50's. Good general information but could use some additional updating.
4,"Less a review, more a statement","As I read and watch the endless political rantings from advocates on all sides in this, the political season, my thoughts turn to this book. This book is a short, insightful read, and the perfect primer to get your mind in the right place to sort through all the mud soon to be slung at us, the voters. I've just pulled it off my top honors bookshelf to read again."
4,great book,very interesting and good. so many years and still true! looks like statistics never change. should be read by everyone.
3,not sure,"I saw this book at Barnes and Noble. I only skimmed it but it does not seem as good- or as depressing- as Bowling Alone. I agree that it is a very relevant theme but I think the authors need to gather more real-world input and not just paint a rosy picture from just a couple of examples. I think that as a writer, you need to take on the hardest and most entrenched issues and then try to dig through them. When you've reached the bottom, then you start to come back up, gathering solutions to the issue and examples of what did and did not work. This book does not go deep enough and it just skips around among various topics and issues. One of the problems with sociological writing today is that it tends to really focus on the problems but not the solutions. So in that way, I feel that this book succeeds. But I guess it just seems hastily put together and in need of more research."
4,Only complaint is that it doesn't have fingering.,"This is a great collection of polkas. The arrangements look great. If you're a beginner be warned, it doesn't have any fingering at all."
2,Not as good as I expected...,"This book was fair...not as good as I expected though. The music was at an intermediate level but the arrangements could have been a lot better than they were. In general, I like the arrangements from Gary Dahl because they sound more musical. I am a professional accordion artist and in order to make these arrangements sound good enough to the point where I would feel comfortable performing them in public, I would basically have to re-arrange them myself...which defeats the purpose of buying a book of pre-arranged accordion songs."
4,Quality for the money,"As a band director, I recently purchased this item for use in my classroom. The stand is consturcted of quality guage steel and is quite sturdy. Being that I often play many different instruments with students, it is nice that it holds multiple instruments.The only negative is that the top peice threads into the tripod for storage. These threads sometimes become loose and you have to periodically tighten the top part. If you use it mostly in a stationary location you might want to put some lock-tight on the threads.Good product, would recommed to students and professionals."
3,GREAT GYM SHORTS,"PRETTY HAPPY WITH THESE SHORTS.THEY WERE DELIVERED REASONABLY QUICKLY AND WERE WHAT I HAD EXPECTED..A GOOD QUALITY GYM SHORT,EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE AND PERFECT FOR ME LENGTHWISE. I WAS HAPPIER WITH THE NAVY BLUE THAN THE ROYAL BLUE WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE A BIT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THEY TURNED OUT TO BE. STILL OK THOUGH. HAVE GOTTEN ALOT OF USE OUT OF BOTH PAIRS ALREADY."
5,Great Mag,"I bought this for my teenage grandson and the reason I chose this magazine is because years ago I had always enjoyed it! Well, it proved that it has staying power through the years. My grandson enjoys it also an looks forward to each and every issue."
4,Good purchase,Easy gift to give and long lasting read! My son-in-law really likes this one so much that we got it for him again.
1,A Magazine for Kids Not For Professionals,"Purchased a digital subscription and regret it. A magazine for kids who like to look at pretty pictures. Unfortunately 95 percent fluff. Very little solid info. Lacking instructive content, but often has pretty photos of cars and of pretty girls, if that is what you like. Mostly advertising, I wouldn't wast the money on it again."
4,Fine introduction to a great altoist,"One of the greatest Ellington's solloists can hardly be adequatly presented on a single cd, and that's the main reason why I give only four stars to this collection of romantic but swinging music.Could the choice of the great alto-sax player's tracks have been better?Probably, but there are more than enough top class performances on this CD, so anyone interested in learning what Johnny Hodges was all about - in Ellington's band and in smaller groups - is well advised to purchase this edition."
3,Warning--this is about Architecture not Outer Space.,"My fault for not looking more closely, but I was misled by the title. I thought this would be a book that I could use with a unit study on the Solar System and Astronomy, but it is about a different kind of ""space"" (Architecture & Design). There is only one activity that has to do with designing a spaceship."
1,I just didn't get it...,"A friend gave me this book as a gift because she had found it to be ""hilarious.""Huh?I have to admit that the only reason I finished this book was that I was trying desparately to find something, anything, funny in it. Unfortunately, the story was ponderous, depressing, and egregiously pretentious from beginning to end."
1,Easy Slumber,It is on a very rare occasion that I fail to finish a book.I feel compelled to say that this was one of them. After 100 pages I decided I could take no more. This book started me off on the wrong foot. The introduction produced a large number of characters all at once which were impossible to assimilate. The author failed to capture an audience with such boring characters and much of the narration was in rambling form.
2,An antique curiosity,"Forester's day has come and gone. This book is interesting to read from a historical perspective but has little practical value in the second decade of the 21st century.Newbies who need real world information about transportation cycling should start their quests elsewhere and save their money.Forester spends many pages stuck in boring old git mode. I am from the same generation as JF and even I find him often insufferable.His over the top, my way or the highway opinions are largely unhelpful to novice knowledge seekers, IMHO."
3,Opinionated but useful,"Forester does have his predjudices, and not many experienced cyclints would agree with all his opinions. Still, this is a very useful and helpful book for any bicyclist, and especially so for the commuting and urban cyclist."
5,BOMSHEL DROP,"HOW AWESOME - I CERTAINLY HOPE THEY DO MORE, I SAW THEY AT A CONCERT AND WAS TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY AND WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND THIS CD TO LISTEN TO AND SHARE WITH MY FIREND, I BOUGHT THREE OF THEM!"
1,rip off,I was mislead! This was marketed as the old style can. You even said people that bought this bought the old style pour spouts! THE OLD STYLE POUR SPOUTS DO NOT WORK WITH THE CAN. IT HAS THE SAFETY SPILL PROOF SPOUT AND IS ABSOLUTLY NO GOOD TO POUR GAS INTO AN OLD SYLE VEHICLE. IW WAS DELIBERTLY MISLED. This was a totla rip off.
2,Typical Blitz,"The can ""sucked in"" after a few months and is now indented on the sides. The spouts are rubbish that came with it. Too many spout parts. Next time I buy genuine military jerry cans."
3,the best 5 gal can and the best nozzle,"good news, bad news, first the good news, this is the standard jerry can, you can't go wrong with it. it will survive the apocalypse. bad news actually there are two bad news, this is the best nozzle you can buy, but in order to get this nozzle you have to buy the can. so the 10 dollar nozzle is like 40 bucks. i've searched all over the internet and couldn't find anybody that carried a 5 gal nozzle. now bad part 2; it will take you 50 years to get the gas out of the can and into your car, no venting. if you poured it into a mason jar and put it in your car with a teaspoon you might get it done faster. it's better than the standard nozzle which is even slower.the best scenario is a really great wide mouth funnel and don't use any nozzle. would i but this again, in a heart beat yet. because i always forget a funnel. when i travel to out of the way places or during hurricanes i keep four of these with me at all times."
3,Three Stooges,"The Three Stooges are a classic, and this collection is great. The down side is that I received my first one, it was all dented and the voice button that plays little clips was broken and rattling inside the tin. I received a replacement tin and lo and behold, it was dented and gashed. I am very upset by the packaging but the collection itself and the voice button is very cool. I have seen this same tin at a retail store and again, it was full of dents galore. Stinks because it's a great collectors item. BEST of luck to those who order this as it is not guaranteed that it wont be dented. Maybe the tin should be sent with a ton of the popcorn packing material...."
1,Mis-leading packaging,"Curly, perhaps the most popular and most imatated stooge is on the cover, on the back and in all the pictures that come with this slick looking boxed set.But he is in only one of the three short films. (Also, there are hardly any short films that come with this. The other filler is cartoons, a movie without Curly and interviews and other junk.)This is not a good collection for fans of Curly. It is however good at misleading the 3 Stooges fan into thinking that he or she has found a gold mine of 3 Stooges material at a great price. Sadly, that is not to be.Instead of wasting your time and money on this blatent rip-off, you would be better off at building your 3 Stooges library on other collections that don't contain the words ""75th Anniversary Collection."""
3,ATTENTION: This product and the reviews are all mixed up.,"There has to be some type of mix-up here. I just bought this one disc set (uses both sides of single disc) at Wal-Mart on the five-dollar rack. The cover is identical to that posted here. It says, on the cover, that there is 4 hours of classic comedy. The heading here says 5 hours and that it's a two disc set. Some of the reviews say 7 discs and over 11 hours of viewing. What goes? These things don't make sense and can't be resolved. Something must be drastically wrong. Let's get Amazon to get their act together and straighten this mess out. Then, I'll watch and review the disc I bought. In the meantime I'm giving it a neutral 3 star rating. I'll be back to do this when the problem is over. Trust me.Gary Peterson"
3,Three Stooges Collector's Edition,"The first disc is disappointing in that it only contains 4 of their early shorts for a total of 80 min. The second disc contains a 1946 movie, ""Swing Parade of 1946""; a 1949 TV pilot for a proposed Three Stooges series, ""Jerk of All Trades""; 15 Three Stooges cartoons, the live action shots from their cartoon show and four Three Stooges movie trailers for a total 229 min. It's a real shame that they decided to put so little material on the first disc. But, all in all, it's still a pretty good buy with some great Three Stooges material on it."
1,Garbage,"Others have said most of the things I was going to say. This set is trash. Specifically, the documentary was sort of interesting for tidbits of information I wasn't aware of but was produced horribly. The mic on the narrator was pushed right up to his mouth causing too much proximity effect and you can hear the plosives clipping on the VO track. I'm in audio and this is basic, audio recording 101 stuff, folks. Even the stuff I thought was mildly fun was not worth putting up with the hours of utter dreck to experience. I didn't even bother watching everything. This is a great white elephant gift exchange candidate if you're stuck with it because it looks like it would be great. But it isn't. Stay away."
1,We are the Stooges!,"The packaging is so deceiving! I had to have this set. Glad i only paid 10 bucks with ship. i'll be very happy to sell it, break even and get somebody else peeved off at me for selling them JUNK!Usually I read comments/reviews section. this time i failed to do so and i got burned. Caveat emptor! boys and girls. Read the reviews before you buy."
1,A complete misrepresentation of the classic trio,The packaging is beautiful. Any fan of the Three Stooges would love it except for the fact that the majority of this material on this DVD set isn't the classic Three Stooges we grew up to love. It is VERY MISLEADING.Anyone defending the integrity of this release should be considered an employee of Madacy Entertainment.
4,the three stooges,"buy this kind of movies all the time good and funny you'll enjoy it.i collect old time movies, this is one you will watch over and over again."
1,Misleading,"You get what you pay for with this set. Only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun. It may fill the gap in someones collection, but mostly contains fillers and short dvds. It appears to be a collection of videos that no one else wanted. One full DVD is the lame three stooges cartoons. If you are looking for classic stooge comedy this set contains very little."
1,3 Stooges Collectors Edition,This thing is horrible do not buy it. Only one episode with Curly all else is terrible. Old clips and movies not funny at all Do no but this you will be very disapointeed as I was.
1,Save your money,"Should have read the box before I purchased. Lots of early stooges, cartoons, and Curly Joe Stooges...not the shorts we all know and love. Should have known better...the price was too good! Looks like it's $100 bucks for the stuff I really wanted!"
1,Not what I expected - a rip off,"The price was attractive, as was the packaging. The box shows Curly. But alas - Curly is not easily found in this compilation. Also - a lot of the ""extra features"" are lame. Stay away from this product. If you really want the Three Stooges - buy the 8 volume compilation from Sony instead."
2,Not what I expected as a big stooges fan,"This is not a collection of shorts, as you would expect it to be. Rather, it's a disappointing collection of odds and ends. As others have noted in other reviews, there are only a few shorts. You're better off finding a different collection if you want to see the shorts, just as I will end up having to do. I think the case is very misleading as it says there is over 11 hours of material there and it doesn't specify what the material is."
1,3 stooges 75th anniversary dvd set,"It came damaged, I sent it back to be delivered in 2 to 3 days and still have not received a replacement. The last time I emailed him, he said he did not get it back and that was after 11 days. I think it was damaged before he even sent it and thought I would keep it because of Christmas, now he is just ignoring me. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I would like my money back plus what I paid for shipping twice."
1,Total rip off,"The Three stooges( Collectors Edition)The box says ""7DVDs over 11 hours"" what they dont say is that there are only 4 classic stooges shorts and only on the first DVD. The rest of the set is crap. The reamaining 6 1/2 dvds /10 hours are patched together bad movies and cartoons ( remember the really bad stooges cartoons you wouldnt even watch back in the 60's) It is intentionaly misrepresented. The packaging is first class, a real eyegrabber, but whats inside is junk."
2,Not what you expect,"I went into buying this eight DVD box set believing that there would be at least a few classic ""Stooges"" shorts. Instead, I receive only ONE DVD of shorts, the rest of the set being comprised of various clips, biographies, and rare footage of the Howard brothers. I'm all for learning a bit about our classic comedy heritage here, but my main complaint is that the clips on each DVD borrow greatly from each other (you'll find yourself watching one DVD, realizing you've seen these clips on the LAST DVD!), the clips are poorly edited together, and there are far too many annoying ""Pop-up Video""-esque factoids that are indeed informative, but get in the way of enjoying the Stooges' comedy.If you're interested in learning about the team here, read a biography. If you want to actually WATCH the Stooges, try a different box set."
1,Waste of money,This is a complete waste of money for any real Stooges fan. You do get three DVDs. One is cartoon stooges. One is Laurel and Hardy. Only one is 3 Stooges -1 Curly episode and 2 Shemp episodes. My husband is a huge Stooges fan and couldn't watch anything except the Curly episode. I don't feel it was properly advertised on the box.
3,Swing Parade of 1946 is the only reason to buy this DVD!,"The ""75th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" has been used for years on marketing the public domain shorts/movies of the Three Stooges. The title can be misleading for some people.I bought my copy today at Walmart for $5.00, only because it had the movie Swing Parade of 1946 in it.The DVD version I bought only has one double-sided disc.Side A contains:Three Stooges Shorts(80 Min. -B&W;)Disorder in the CourtSing A Song of Six PantsBrideless GroomMalice in the PalaceSide B contains:Jerk of All Trades TV pilot (21 min. B&W;)Live Action Color Classics(60 min. Color)Swing Parade of 1946(Feature Film *74 min. B&W;)Three Stooges Cartoons(15 Animated titled Color 50 min.)4 Three Stooges Movie TrailersFor only five dollars, I am satisfied with what I got. If you are looking for a true box set, then I recommend theThe Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection."
2,A Very Poor Compilation,"You know those classic slap-stick ""Three Stooges"" shorts that are always on TV? Well forget those because only 4 of their 220 short-films made it into these 7 discs. Those 4 being the public domain shorts that have been released time and time again. The rest of this set is comprised of the team's early work with Ted Healy (which was before the Stooges even developed their act), some late ""Curly Joe"" material and cartoons. Fans who see this impressive looking box-set will be puzzled and disappointed by the lack of what the packaging promises. It is very deceptive."
1,Disappointed by a long shot,"I was quite unhappy to know that this wasn't a ""Collection"" of shows, but more of a ""The making of"" series. There were only a few episodes on it, and the rest of it was a disappointment by a long shot! If you are looking for watching actual Three Stooges, DON'T BUY THIS!"
2,Not Shemp!,"Half of these feature Shemp instead of Curly, which nobody wants. The second disc is only cartoons, which nobody wants. So really you're only getting a couple decent episodes for your money."
5,The ultimate novel about pure evil!,"I first read this book over 20 years ago, while a high school student in Connecticut (Mr. Tryon's birthplace). I never saw the movie because I was afraid ""Hollywood"" would ruin a perfect story. I have never read a novel since that is as suspenseful or frightening. Please bring this masterpiece back so other generations may enjoy(?) it."
5,Excellent.,"Tryon does everything exactly right in this novel, a classic psychological horror story. I envy anyone encountering it for the first time."
5,Find this book!,"My dad introduced me to the work of Thomas Tryon. A few months ago he found a handful of books up in the garage that he'd read when he was in high school, and some of Tryon's novels were among them. I cooked through Harvest Home and was very impressed with with his masterful descriptions and breathtaking plot twists/revelations. Then I read The Other... I was completely blown away. You can't miss this book. It's a masterpiece. It's not frightening in a slasher, better-look-over-your-shoulder-type way, but the concept will chill you, without a doubt. It's such a good story, and it's executed so well... It's the best book I've read in a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who is the mood for a good, haunting, thought-provoking piece of literature. My hat is off to Thomas Tryon... I can't wait to get my hands on another one of his works."
3,Wish I'd read it 20 years ago instead of today,"I enjoyed this novel (which I picked up at a garage sale), but I wish I'd read it when it came out in the 1970s, when stories based around this sort of psychological twist were new and shocking. There have been many, many similar stories since, so I don't think it impacted me as strongly as it would have had I read it then. I kept thinking, they need to get some grief counselors and pscyhologists to help these people--which of course wasn't common in the '70s, and definitely not in the '30s when this story takes place. Still, speaking from 2001, that was my reaction. Everyone seemed so unconcerned about getting to the root of the problem at hand--and allowing a kid a fantasy which few parents would consider harmless in similar circumstances today.Also, the pacing seemed very slow to me--another indication of how popular fiction has changed over the years.King and Koontz scare me more these days, but it was a good read."
3,"Good, but....","This had such good reviews I had to buy it & read it... I don't know why exactly, but I just didn't get into this book. It was good, but it wasn't great to me. Maybe I'm to young to really appreciate it. I think people my parents age would really enjoy this book more (people who grew up in the 40's-50's) & I might have too, if I read this back in the 70's or early 80's.Anyways, it's a good realistic psychological horror & VERY well written. The whole idea of identical twins being born on different days, thus having different astrological signs/personalities. I thought was good. However, I wouldn't recommend this book to people under the age of 30."
2,Simply NOT that good.,"I really wanted this to be a better book, especially when faced with all the ""Wait until you get to the TWIST!"" comments I had heard. Um, well, I assumed what the ""TWIST"" was about 10 pages into the book.Great idea, just overwrought prose and not nearly creepy enough."
3,WAVE RADIO GREATS GREAT REVIEWS,GOOD BUY WORKS WELL IN BEDROOM NO TINNY SOUNDS BUT NOT LOUD ENOUGH FOR LIVING ROOM OR KICHEN AREA
1,Don't get this radio.,"I own and use the best radios on the market. I have and use the Tivoli Model One, Tivoli PAL, and Boston Acoustics Recepter among others, and all the ones I just listed sound much better than the Bose Wave Radio, PLUS they are much cheaper too!There is also one called a Cambridge model 88 that is better than the Bose Wave Radio as well.When you are comparing these radios side by side, the first one you turn off and throw aside is the Bose Wave Radio, it is that bad when compared to the rest.If you want a good sounding table radio, I would suggest the Tivoli Model One instead. If you want a good clock radio for the nightstand, then I would suggest the Boston Recepter. Both are available through Amazon.comI don't work for any of these companies, but I have bought all of the radios exept for the Bose Wave Radio, I borrowed one for a day and had no interest in buying one. Even if it was cheaper, and smaller, but it sounded the same as it does now, I still would not buy it."
3,Good but not Great,"I'm a huge Pinback fan, and i'm also a fan of techno remixes, but i guess when you combine the two i'm not a huge fan. I was hoping for more with this E.P. The songs can get very repititive and the quirks are alittle over done in some songs. This is in my opinion Pinback's worse release, but coming from a band like this a mediocore remix E.P. is far from the end of the world. If you are just getting into Pinback, then I would not recommend this for you; try any of their other E.P.s to get a sense of their more melodious music. If you already know and like Pinback then this release would be a good addition to your cd collection, but don't expect greatness out of this one"
4,chico hamilton timely,cheeks grove is the hook on this cd . chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch band....worth a listen BIG DADDY
2,Made my foot hurt,"I used this product for about a week and a half then decided to stop using it. At first I had the straps adjusted too tight which made my foot and leg hurt from squeezing too much. Then I loosened them and thought it would be better but my foot hurt so much that I would wake up about 3AM in pain and would have to take it off and the sound of velcro peeling away at 3AM also wakes up the person beside you too. When you lay down your foot naturally wants to turn to the side and with this brace on, it put pressure against the side of my foot which was tolarable for a few hours but then it would really start hurting where the strap went around my foot. If I kept my foot pointed straght up then it did not pull but that isn't how my foot is naturally positioned when I sleep. It's a little pricy for what it actually is."
4,"Two Legged, Four Legged, No Legged Rhymes","Currently I am enroled in a Children's Literature class reviewing poetry. I selected this poetry collection because I am focusing on Elementary School children and the development of poems in their curriculum. This collection is creative and magnified in language and the illustrations are delightful, delicate paintings done by Pamela Paparone. Each illustration addds wry humor and gives the reader a better understanding of the Two-legged, Four-legged, No-legged Friends that we have."
1,we must feel bad that this was our Poet Laureate,"Pinsky is in love with being a poet, but his poems don't mean anything to the rest of us. This book is a perfect example of this. We are supposed to admire him, not read him, and I find it a shame that this lousy work got him a Luareateship."
5,I love this album,"This is my favorite album this year. Although folks are calling it a ""concept"" album, I prefer to think of it a a rock opera wedged somewhere between Sgt Peppers and Eldorado. My 16 year old daughter and I are currently fighting about which song is the best, but we love them all."
5,"""Good Stuff""","I first obtained this product in a gourmet chocolate shop in Punta Gorda, Florida. I enjoyed it very much, but after returning home to Maryland I had no idea where I could purchase more. I went to Amazon and there it was. Thank you, Amazon."
3,Not bad in its day,Great camera with large LCD screen. Takes great picturesin bright light. Not bad in low light with slow shutter.ProblemsNo shutter speed control above 1/30.No pass through of RCA/Svid to IEEE 1394 for capture use.No line level audio input while taping.Focus controls right next to microphone.Zoom control fragile.Camera forgets last mode when shut off.No histogram of exposure.
1,"Brand new, out of the box and it doesn't work.","Just purchased this little gem and went to insert the cassette. The instructions say ""The cassette compartment will automatically lift up and open when opening the lid."" It Doesn't. For $1,359, I'm back to Circuit City for a new one. If I have problems once more . . . then I'll try another brand."
3,DIY,"To begin with. Your site/posting did not offer/recommend a board for 2 door XL SUPER DUTY. It only stated that the running board fits the Ford F-250 super duty. The Dee Zee board is actually for a crew cab. I did not realize this, till/after I mounted all the cab panel brackets and placed the board to mount it.I wrote to Dee Zee for a bracket to mount on the frame to support the end extending under the front sideS of the truck bed. NO RESPONSE!Checked online with other truck accessories and they specifically display and disclose running boards formy F-250 super duty, 2 door models!I AM DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST."
4,MARTI' s review,"This was a different type of book for me from this author. The heroine Emily is a reporter that in her quest to expose a US Senator as being ""unstable"", suddenly gets stuck with a ghost that follows her home. The story is entertaining, and has very good moments. I was kind of surprised about her relatively easy access to a US Senator- Lee. They develop a relationship that eventually leads into love. An interesting triangle between Emily, Lee and the ghost. I recommend it."
4,emilys ghost,I really enjoyed this book.Thought it was exciting at times and made me sad at times.It was a real page turner.
3,Great Read,"This was a great book. It took a few pages to get into it, but once I did I couldn't put it down. It's funny, sweet and sad."
3,something differrent as far as animation.,"not what i expected, not a bad film, just must be watched a second time to really get plot\story. very beautiful scenery noired out. the b\w really gives the gritty contrast to all characters."
3,Not aging well...,"When I first saw this film on DVD only a few years back, I was blown away. I saw it extremely cheap on Blu-ray on Amazon and figured I'd bite. The problem is, this film is made using 3D and then rendered in black and white, and much of it is starting to look very dated, especially when viewed with more picture clarity. Much of the character models, mouth movement, lighting, shading and everything else is of a lower quality than a quality video game release; and worse, many science-fiction films are starting to walk similar territory in the story department. It's still a cool flick, but in this particular case, Blu-ray may be overkill."
5,Excellent,"Once again Nick Kemp mixes music and voice to produce deep states of relaxation, whilst pointing to the deeper truths that are available to all. You may find a mantra here, or simply sounds and word.Either way this CD is highly recommended for anyone who has considered this idea... ""when you've seen beyond your SELF, you may find peace of mind is waiting there."""
3,"For the scholar, not just the enthusiast","An interesting take on Shakespeare's imagery, although the writing itself can be dull and many of the examples used are cliched. The same ideas can be found in similar and more interesting books, although as a scholarly work it presents some good work."
2,Might be better for minivans or SUVs,"Bought this to take two bikes on a road-trip. Rack did fit nicely on the bumper of my car and didn't leave any scratches. If you own any sort of sedan though beware. This rack places the bike(s) above the height of the car, so not only is it difficult to lift up, but is a killer of gas mileage too. Despite being in the Saris fit guide, my Kia Rio had a drop of around 10mpg and I was travelling slow. I placed the rack on a large domestic sedan and it fit about the same, very high above the car. Apparently it is only meant for mountain bikes with wide tubes as I needed to place rags around the bike tubes on my 3 speed and hybrid in order to prevent slipping. Still the bikes did encounter a few scratches once I reached my destinations. I ended up returning the rack to Amnazon without hassle and bought the Thule Speedway which fits much lower on my car and the bikes fit on it properly."
1,BEWARE False advertisement,"This is a Graber guadian 3 ike rack, NOT a Saris guadian 3. I purchased it and it looks very simular, but has no anti-sways and the straps are a hard cheap plastic. I called the company and they said all they could do was have me send it back and get my money back. I informed them that the pictures on the advertisements were not of the one they sent me and they just said if I was unhappy with my purchase, I could return it. This was a week ago, and as I see they still advertise the Saris with anti-sways and rubber hold down straps. BEWARE of this company!!!!"
4,Bought Octber 2004 - Very Reliable,"Unit only has less than 50 hrs on the lamp as of November 2006, but has been easy to use and quite reliable. The case shipped with the unit, however, started to come apart about a year ago, and when I called in Nov. of 2006 they said there would only have been a 90 day warranty on the case, so they wanted $35 for a replacement case. I wasn't happy, but what can you do.Biggest problem most users have driving this with a laptop is they get confused by the toggle keystrokes used to power up the outside video port. It can be particularly confusing if your video card has dual monitor capability, in which case the cursor actually moves from one ""screen"" to another (one being the laptop screen, the other being the outside screen or in this case the projector screen."
3,be careful,This is the second one I've bought. The fist one had a sticking problem with one of the buttons. So every once in a while the garage door would open on its own. Not a good thing. So be careful.
5,I always use this cookbook,"This cookbook is filled with easy to make recipes that are light(er) than standard and that also taste good. I say ""light(er)"" because some recipes like the easy chicken stroganoff use ingredients like light sour cream and pasta. While it isnt the lightest meal, it is lighter than is relatives and still tastes good. All of the recipes list calories, fat, carbs etc..I do not think I have actually made anything from this book that wasn't good and I have cooked at least 30 of the books recipes at least once.I am a pretty lazy cook and selfish with my free time. I do not want to mess with something that has tons of ingredients, long preparation or long cooking times. When I use this book I target recipes that can be made in around an hour or less and that have a simple list of ingredients. There are many to choose from in that category.I have recommended this book to all of my friends and several co-workers."
3,Classic Tony Vega Vids,Only had I think about 5 of his videos on this DVD. The first one with Tito Puente was super hot!
4,hammer head,"I got the ""Dead-on"" hammer, I love it. However, in the website they would give a free Pry bar with it. I didn't get the free pry bar. their website sometimes confused me."
3,"Bulky, but comfortable","It has plenty of padding and stays put, but it seems sort of bulky. I can see the profile easily through my pants. I am a female so I may just be that I wear tighter pants. It fits my .38 special perfectly."
1,ARGGGGGG!!!!!!!,This is generic half less than ok - half horrible - completely unforgetable - generic drudge - please get back with Survivor and make something someone in America would like? or are you happy playing to tiny crowds in Europe - comeon....lets get back together for some good music - not this sore missing any punch run of the mill yuk - Survivor could have rocked the sh.. out of the Real One - which is now being endless played on radio...
4,Safari Memoir,I enjoyed this book. Ruark honestly describes his fear as he faces the dangerous game animals of 1950s east Africa. If you are a hunter you will appreciate this book. If you are not a hunter and don't have a special interest in East Africa then this book will likely hold little appeal for you.
5,Real Africa at it's best...,"Ruarks style and attention to details make this book leap off the page. Visions of the African landscape appear in your mind. Ruark describes the sights, smells, and the very face of Africa. Also the foreshadowing of his alcoholism is recounted time and again. I can't wait to read it again!"
3,from another bwana,"you know how they say''anticipation is sweeter than the possession'' thats what happened with me.Before buying this book I'have read the other reviwes,with no disrespect to other readers, but I think they have over done it a little.I am a long time big game hunter,what I found what is missing in this book is a thru heart of an hunter. The horn was there, but not the hunter. After reading the book, I remember more of the memsaabs hair care than the hunting adventures.I felt ,for Mr Ruark the shooting part of the safari was the most booring bit.Well that is his styl and I respect himI just wanted to share my thoughts with rest of my bwana brothers.Still a good reading.Especially to know the great character of Mr. Selby."
5,Horn of the Hunter By Robert Ruarke,"I purchased this any several more for my husband. He loves to read and to be informed on many different things. This coming year the oportunity came up for him to go to Africa to hunt. As he is an avid hunter and hunts all over this continent each year he jumped at the oportunity. Now part of his prep he is reading about the great safaries of the past,Ruark Hemingway Roosevelt Botington etc. We really enjoyed this book as he wrote about all aspects of the trip with very little editing. I t was about bravery in foreign country but also about his humility at the very differnt struggles of the people and thier cultures. I think everyone who reads this will be entertained in thier own way and will take something away from this that they will never forget. Happy reading and remember read some of the books on the back shelves you may just find a treasure."
5,BEST BOOK About an African Hunting Safari,This is by far and away the BEST book I've ever read about a hunting safari in Africa. Ruark and his writing are in a class by himself. ALL the other books about him like Use Enough Gun were published after his untimely death. NONE of them compare. They are collections of articles and/or very short stories (some fiction) that collectively don't hold a candle to Horn of the Hunter. His writing makes you feel like you are beside him sharing his experiences. You will not regret buying this book. Simply the best!!
5,Horn of the Hunter,I loved his stories of Africa! The book took me back to a better time when being on safari meant you could be killed by very dangerous animals or reptiles but humans were not quite as high up the list in the danger catalogue.
4,Beat Takeshi's american picture,"Brother is a good movie. With the classic structure and style from the kitano's movies (it means slow, explosive and very emotional), now adding a different background: LA. (With a sceen from the beach like all his movies!) If you like the classical movies about jakuzas, samurais, and all the ethic from budo, hara kiris... etc. you'll love it. And if you like gangster movies with mexicans ""Cholos"" ""pendejos"", B-boys, nigg**S and that stuff, you'll love it too. Is not his best movie but is one of the most i liked."
3,Did I miss something?,"Seemed like some things in this movie wernt explained much. You can follow whats going on, what happened, etc but it seemed like it had many holes. The direction is only there half the time. It had some cool scenes in it but it could have been a much better movie"
4,The coolest man on Earth,"Kitano's first (and only) feature film foray into English language territory, BROTHER may be Kitano at his simplest, but most certainly at his coolest - since Hana Bi, anyway.Kitano plays a disgraced Yakuza foot soldier whose extreme behaviour sees him exiled in the US, where his younger brother lives. Kitano starts his new life exactly where his old life left of - with extreme violence.This is Kitano at the height of his self-destructive performances. Separated from his ""family"", adrift in a banal culture, with little understanding of the language, his fast and fiery rise to power is bested only by his rapid decline.One gripe: when are we going to see more features - particularly commentaries - on Kitano DVDs. Even ZATOICHI is barren of such DVD basics."
4,Very quick review,"I'll get around to writing a better review eventually. I liked the movie, and just wanted to point out that Denny revenge scene wasn't too light because he wasn't finished. Because of the ending events happened differently then he thought they were going to."
2,Mind numbing violence,"This movie is about a Japanese gangster exiled from his homeland and forced to flee to America. From the moment he sets foot on foreign soil, his orgy of violence and destruction begins. If you're a fan of action and violence, this movie has plenty of both. The film portrays the extremely violent lifestyle of Japanese gangsters. Unfortunately that's about all it has going for it.Much of the time the plot seems disjoint and unconnected. Music is lacking. A lot of the time it was difficult to understand what was going on. I can only recommend this to gangster movie aficionados."
1,boring,This movie was really boring. It was slow and uninteresting. the man who did this movie is the one trying to bring back the Zatoichi series. I have not seen the new Zatoichi movie yet but this movie gives me great doubts about how good it will be. His other movies may be good but this one is a definite time waster. Save yourselves.
4,just right,"Takeshi knows his crime drama and this film, while not as thoughtful as Fireworks, is stunning. If you enjoy a different style of pacing and characters with character then his movies are up your alley. Violent and then peaceful, Brother is more a work of art than just a yakuza film."
3,This DVD contains an edited version.,"Since everyone else has already written about how they thought much of the film was formulaic, which it was, or how Kitano transcends the cliches, which he does, I'll just say that, despite some faltering performances by a few of the American actors, the film is very identifiable and enjoyable as a ""Kitano"" film. What you should know is that the disc contains a ""cleaned-up"" version of the film in which many scenes containing violent content have been cropped or had gore digitally removed for U.S. release. I don't believe it affects the running time much, but it is different from the Japanese release. Also, if the subtitles (English or otherwise) are enabled, they run on all dialogue throughout the movie. A selection were only the non-English dialogue is subtitled would have been appreciated. I watch many subtitled films, but it felt distracting here."
5,WOW THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hands down the greatest movie of 2001.WOW!what a gangster perfect mafia pic.TAKESHI ""BEAT"" KITANO IS THE MAN!He directed and stars in this great action mobster YakuZA flick evryone would love.It is well thought out and concept is great.A blen of SCARFACE and RESERVOIR DOGS but very different and unique .After you see this movie you will rush to the video store and buy it i assure you! WOW *****""s.Check out also ""FIREWORKS"" with Beat Tkeshi also directed and ""SONATINE"".BROTHER IS UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!BUY OR RENT AT ALL COSTS_---""TWO THUMBS UP, WAY UP!""______EMAIL ME about what you think or info ...ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointing,"I was hoping to get a step-by-step DVD on how to create a square foot garden. This was not that DVD. This DVD was really disappointing. I really need the help in getting my garden going, but this DVD didn't help.- No information on how to create your raised beds (which type of wood to use and why? How high should they be and why?)- No information on how to create Mel's mix (I'm not sure what she used for her soil, she never said)- No information on where to put the raised beds in your yard (Should you look for a shaded area? Lots of sun? Which plants for what type of shade)- No information on when and how often to water- Very little information on when to harvest- Very little information on how to take care of your plants in case of insects or diseases.This DVD was mainly about the plants the author chose to plant, spending about 15 minutes on the various varieties of tomato plants.The only good part of this DVD was the interview with Mel."
1,even the stray cat outside wasn't interested!,"Since my cats have always loved Cosmic Catnip, I figured they might also enjoy the treats. What a disappointment! Neither cat even nibbled, and when I left some outside for the neighborhood stray, he even passed! Save your money and just buy grocery store treats."
4,Denso spark wires,The Denso spark wires were what I expected. I was a little disappointed that they did not have the seperators already attached. But all in all a good buy.
5,Vitrin,Well you know your really never sure about taking a pill with no actual effect like a pain reliever but all my research on Vitrin points out that its one of the best out there on the market especially if your not getting all your fruits and Veggies!
4,For a class,"I ordered this book for an essay writing class, and I was worried it wasn't going to come in time but it did, in fact before I expected it to. The book itself is pretty good, but you have to be prepared for Berger's writing style."
5,We Mock What We Don't Understand,Words of Wisdom. Much of this book is based on scare tactics that are pretty funny actually. I liked the book for its comedy. Worth the money.
2,it's your choice,"Do you always believe what you read. For many, we do. They say, you can't judge a book by its cover, and that is what many people do to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. To know what they are about, and why you ""fear"" them, you must get to know them. If you feel that this book is true, it may work, or it may not, but pray about it. Mormons aren't bad, no one is. It's only what we say, think and act, that makes people and their religion seem bad. Saying something about other people is a choice that we each have,...""free agency"" and should try to be Christ like in that choice."
1,Entertaining,What an entertaining read...complete fiction I must add but a good book to remind you that there are still narrow minded people in the world who profess to know so much about a religon that they actualyy know very little about. This book makes a great lining for the kittie's litter box...wonderful absorbency!!!
5,The final proof that Joseph Smith was a false prophet.,"How To Answer A MormonIt enables the average Christian to refute Mormon missionaries with ease!.........Sword Of The Lord:Here's practical advice on how to bring a Christian witness to Mormons. Eight false prophecies from Mormon documents are discussed including the location of the ""Ten Lost Tribes"" and the discovery of people inhabiting the Moon..........Christian Bookseller's Association:This is a book we have needed for a long time. I have been confused with this problem. This book has some good guidelines on dealing with this issue"
1,"The choice is yours, so save some money.","If you do let the missionaries in and listen, you'll learn about ""free agency"", i.e. the option to think and decide for yourself. Buying this book is the first step to giving up that priviledge."
2,Save Yourself Six Bucks,"Here's an alternative: Tell the missionaries ""Come on in. I'll listen to your story, think about it, and decide for myself.""Then contemplate your beliefs at Taco Bell, over six bucks' worth of ChocoTacos.A much better use of your cash"
2,Good CD for new singer- Shery Listen to your fans!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XXDWVS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleShery try to project out your voice. You have about 4 good songs here and I really want you to do well. Keep up the good work!-Elvis
4,The Long Secret By : Louise Fitzhugh,"I liked this book; it had many interesting and complex parts. First, one of my opinions- I think that Harriet talks very rudely to her friends and to others. She really needs to tone down her emotions and act more like the sensible and polite girl that I know she can be.Ok... now for the actual summary part of my review...The book mostly focuses on Beth Ellen, Harriet's ""summer"" best friend when Sport and Jamie aren't around. Through out the story, Beth Ellen and Harriet make new friends (like Jessie Mae, a poor country girl), and Beth Ellen's long-lost mother comes back from Paris with her new husband, Wallace. By the end of the tale, together, Beth Ellen and Harriet have solved a huge mystery and become closer than they were before. Check out The Long Secret By Louise Fitzhugh to find out the rest of the story!- A Happy Reader"
5,An excellent book,"This is truly an excellent book, and a great sequel to ""Harriet the Spy."" I read this in 2nd grade, almost immediatley after I finished ""Harriet the Spy"" and loved it. I wish Louise Fitzhugh would have written more. Louise Fitzhugh is a great author, and her books will always be classics in my library."
5,"A lovely book that stands apart from ""Harriet""","There's no question that this is a ""sequel"" to Harriet the Spy, but a fan of the first book shouldn't go in expecting more of the same. The heart of this book is not Harriet but Beth Ellen, and her shyer, more introspective nature give The Long Secret a completely different vibe. The result is a touching, beautifully observed book about one of the most challenging times of life: the point where you're just emerging from childhood and start seeing adults -- and yourself -- more clearly. It's a very funny book and a compelling mystery, but it's not just fun and games. I found the emotional currents of this book quite intense as a child, but I wouldn't trade it for anything."
1,Horribly Disappointed!,"Don't get me wrong, ""Harriet the Spy,"" was one of my all time favorite books (and movies), growing up. I'm almost 26 now and had always wanted to read ""The Long Secret,"" So after re-reading Harriet, I went to the bookstore and ordered myself a copy. Well, at first it wasn't so bad, but there really wasn't any real point to the story. Harriet hadn't matured much at all, and to make matters worse, really offensive and hostile notes were left all over the place. I am also a Christian and find it offensive that the phrase ""Jesus Hates You,"" should be allowed to be published in a Children's book. This is especially true in this day and age, when almost any threat has the potential to turn violent.Skip this one."
1,This student failed to enjoy it,"A previous reviewer said that as a teacher he's found that students never fail to enjoy William Golding's THE INHERITORS. When this reviewer was a sophomore English student, I can assure him that I failed to enjoy this book. My teacher thought this book was one of the all-time literary greats. I just thought it was boring.And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.My plea to high school English teachers everywhere: If you must require your students to read Golding, have them read LORD OF THE FLIES. It's marginally better than THE INHERITORS and, if I remember correctly, does not include ancestor bashing."
1,"Whatever you do, don't buy this book","Unfortunately, I have been forced to read this novel for my English class. It is extremely difficult due to the fact that the main characters haven't mastered a little thing we like to call language yet. Because Golding refuses to help the reader along with proper narration, the outcome is nothing short of a migrane. Just wanted to give all of you presently sane people out there a little warning before throwing all of that sanity away attempting to decipher meaning in this book."
3,Not bad.,I wouldn't have read the book if i didnt need it for a university class. However I did enjoy it. Won't read it again but it was good for a quick read.
3,This one of the most confusing books EVER!!!,At a first glance the book just seems to tell a story that kind of makes little sense at points but is very baisic all in all. This first notion isn't true at all. When you read it over carefully and study it you start to get a sense of that great complexity of the book. If you have to read this book for a class make sure you read it a couple of times it really isn't what it seems.
2,Great if you like confusion....,"This book frustrated me to no end. While I can respect the endeavor to write a book from the perspective of prehistoric man, it just didn't follow through. While Golding's theme of dichotomous man was intriguing, switching from character to character, not clarifying who was who, and the generally unengaging characters made this a very average reading experience for me."
2,Not as good as I hoped!,"I don't think Golding quite got the hang of the early humans he was using as his subjects! There is far more to them and far more interesting and exciting things about them that simply were missing in his story. Not a bad read, but did not come up to my expectations!"
2,An Opportunity Missed,"I found this to be a very disjointed, and often confusing, description of the clash between two human groups. Golding missed a good opportunity to create a compelling case that the Neanderthals could not compete with the new, more advanced, humans."
2,Intriguing Plot.....,"But at some points there is just way to much to take in. Although the plot is very interesting and the characters and scene are well developed, you have to be very dedicated to reading this novel. In some sections it can be very difficult to understand what is going on at all. Unless you are prepared to read pages over and over again, you may want to try something else."
2,What's Going on Here?,"This is the kind of record that gives jazz a bad name. Russell Gunn, a young trumpeter of note, here offers a set of mostly bebop chestnuts supposedly given a fresh reading. Instead, what we get is esoteric, virtuoso, insider treatments. Yes, there are some stunning moments, yes, the fine assemblage of 20- and 30-something jazzers play their butts off, but it generally comes across as cold and academic: ideosyncratic, listener-unfriendly set-pieces. Where's the warmth, the vitality, the craziness that make jazz such a surprizing and engaging music? Not here on this disc, I'm sorry to say."
5,Condor Joe Rules!,"Condor Joe is the most human and endearing character of the show. He reminds me of Clint Eastwood in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". Just one tough son of a bitch."
2,Disappointed...,"I was disappointed in this movie. From the description, I thought it would be more comprehensive regarding Beau Brummell's rise to popularity in Regency England. It was more 'artistic'. I would not recommend."
2,bizarre,"I love period films, but I did not enjoy this one. The plot was thin, I thought the acting was well done."
4,Language,"In this country where English is a foreign language, it is good to know that some fight to preserve its propriety and eloquence."
4,"it made me laugh, it made me cry....","If you like quirky and odd stories about strange things in bizarre circumstances with truly unbelieveable endings, then you must purchase this tome immediately.The story is about Riggs Bombay, a boy who isn't afraid of one single thing, and an old man, named Periphery Stowe, who may know the story of the whole entire universe. But no one can ask him because he's fallen fast asleep. And suddenly, the world isn't working the same as it was before.The prose boarders on the poetic. The artwork is beautiful. And the story contains elements of mythology, and psychology as well as Wagner's own, personal cosmology mixed with his quirky sense of humor.If you liked Madeline L'Engle's ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and ""A Wind in the Door"" as an adult, or ""Sophie's World"" by Jostein Gaarder, then I think you'll like this too."
4,a good time for all,"Characters brimming with personality, and locations beyond imagination, it's hard not to get lost in the imagination of Periphery Stowe right along with Riggs.Though at times showing evidence of being a first novel, it hardly detracts from the beatiful prose and obvious skill the author has for writing.spread it around to your neighbors, your kids, your neighbors kids, all will enjoy.I'm just wondering what tricks Wagner has up his sleeve for his next book.."
4,Easy to listen to,"Danny is someone I used to see at Tommy Makems in New York all the time and I always enjoyed his shows. I have a couple of his early albums and used to tell him when I saw him that he needed to record ""The Town I Loved So Well"" because his live version was the best I had ever heard. When I saw this cd contained that song I ordered it right away. I was not disappointed he did a good job with the song of course it is not the same as in his show but still nice to hear.The rest of the disc is pretty good, not great but solid, he has a great voice and can really play guitar though some of the arrangements were a little over the top.The great thing about Amazon is you can preview the music now before you buy so give this a try it might be just the thing you are looking for."
2,"Product is great, wrong amazon description.","This case was titled as a compact bow case for bow's 43"" long however at the time of purchase the description stated it would fit a 49"" bow. Fast shipping and technically sent the right case per title but was described incorrectly so I had to send it back and I bought it from Cabella's trusting their description."
5,Great birthday gift,"I got this for my grandson for his birthday, it fit his new bow great, got bow for his birthday also. He was the happiest kid in town"
2,Nowhere near Simpsons highlights,"Unfortunately these episodes date from the first 2 series, which were nowhere near as clever, inventive, subtle and hysterical as the later episodes. I really wouldn't bracket any of these as SImpsons classics, having seen maybe 200 episodes. 2 Cars In Every Garage is probably the best, marking the first appearance of a 3-eyed fish (a great insight into the surreal humour of the show's authors). Treehouse Of Horror was stylish and also very surreal, especially the first part. Bart Vs Thanksgiving, and Bart gets an F to an extent, falls into the pigeonhole of early episodes characterised by Bart doing somethig 'bad' (and personally I prefer seeing Homer be stupid) and neither are all that engaging, otehr than the superbly constructed Snow Day scenes. I wouldn't bother with this one."
3,.....dont get this if you have a long torso!,well i loved it except for the part where the shoulder straps dug painfully in to me. so i returned it. dont get this if you have a long torso!!
5,"Magical, and it delivered","When I purchased this item, I was looking for an item that I could wear everyday, with the idea of purchasing 1 for each day of the week. The sizing is a little tricky, inspite of measuring myself. I ordered 1 size up. I had to have my husband help me put on this garment, which he could hardly do without laughing. Once the garment was on his jaw dropped to see that there was a BIG difference. The compression is awesome! This garment really helped my lower back pain! It lifted my breast, reduced my saddlebags, but most of all flattened my stomach. It was a little difficult to slide my pants on over this garment, because of the outter rubber shell. I was able to wear this garment for almost 10 hours. All in all I like this garment, but it needs to be redesigned with the crouch opening a little further to the back for potty time. This garment is magical and it delivered!"
5,squeem squeeze!,"ok so I haven't had the squeem for too long to give a long term review (just received today) but I can say that it is torture just putting it on! It took me a full 30 minutes to fasten all the hook and eye closures and adjust it. With that being said, it looks very promising and am excited to see what it does in 30+ days of full time wear. Very excited. I do like it so far (the few hours I've been wearing it)"
2,"""confused""",I didn't see the logic behind this garment. It's suppose to hold in the belly but yet there's a little opening at the bottom where my belly sticks out from. I sent this back and got the bottomless one. I love that one i have been wearing that one for years.
2,"Brenda, B",This is a good ideal but you need to be measures for the right size.I have order the 2xx and it was to little and I order the 3xx and the legs or the bottom part was to big. But I have the Squeem Rubber High Back Waist Cincher Girdle Style 26J in 2xx and it fitted well.
1,"Strange fit, sent it right back","I bought this item, along with the Squeem Miracle vest. I tried putting this on and it was so odd, I can't imagine anyone actually wearing it. I am 5'4"" and weigh 128. I usually wear a size 6. I ordered the medium size. I put it on and the abdominal area was really tight. However, the crotch area gapped really badly and when I fastened the thighs, they hung loosely. Now, I have saddle bags and my thighs are one of my biggest problem areas. But this was actually way too big to do anything for my thighs, compounded by the gapping crotch. I had great luck with the miracle vest and will be writing a review on that item."
3,Rubbery outer shell,The product does what it says it will do. It holds you in and gives great lift to your bottom. However. The outer shell is a rubbery material and makes getting clothes (jeans) on very difficult. Then doesn't let your clothes moves freely once you have them on. I almost feel like I need to have some form of slip on over this so my clothes can move more naturally.
2,Strange fit,I have big legs and legs on this were too big while the waist area too tight even though I followed the instructions. Had to return it.
1,YUCK!,"I returned this product. The legs were too big and the waist too small. I looked like I was in a strait jacket. I have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it, other than the rubber smell I can't elimate, but this product sucks!"
3,This shapewear- is squeeze wear,"This item was much too small even though I ordered two sizes larger than I thought I would need based on reviews. I returned this item. It was made of rubber so it might make you sweat and feel a little uncomfortable. On the other hand, I think it would have been spectacular under a dress. It really held my stomach but it was too small around my rear end and thighs. It has alot of hooks. If you purchase; you might have to return because the sizes are sooo off."
2,squeem shapewear,well i just recieved my product and it is the wrong color... i ordered nude which i paid 50 dollars more for and recieved beige and the packing even says available in beige and black only.... not very happy at this point feeling a little ripped off!
3,Excellant photos --- not much else,"I'm giving this book a ""3 stars"" for photos, and nothing else. Have you heard the saying ""You can't tell a book by its cover."" Well, with this book you can't tell the Mormons true beliefs by this book."
3,I must qualify my review below. Don't get me wrong. . .,"When I say that the book ""shows you how wonderful the LDS church is"", I mean to say that it is an example of how hard the LDS church tries to present a favorable image. The reader of this book must be aware that it is not objective photojournalism. It is a portrayal of the church through rose-colored lenses."
2,"Neat pictures, not much info","The title would lead one to believe that this book would help explain the foundation and workings of the Mormon faith. This is not the case. The limited text supplies the reader with just a basic explanation of what is being depicted in the photo. This is a good book for someone just interested in getting a superficial intro to this belief system, but nothing more."
4,Picture Book Extraordinare,"This is a compilation of hundreds of photographs taken thatcapture the spirit and liveliness of the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints. There is an excellent introducation byRoger Rosenblatt and an essay by Gordon B. Hickley, thePresident of the Church. The style and flow of the book isvery much modelled on the ""Day in the Life..."" series of books."
3,Good history book,"An interesting book that explains why we dress as we do and it also explains why it is called a Tuxedo in North America, a dinner jacket in the UK and a smoking in many other languages. Furthermore, some important faux paxs are also brought to the reader's attention."
3,Nice for History Reference,"Hi , I bought this book with the expectation to be a guide to in practice how to being dressed in the finest classical style. This is a good guide, however to be aware of the theory of classical style. It is a good book, with history of each piece of cloth, patterns and so on. But you'll have to read it and figure out the best dressing by your own. I would like to have some more tips on how to match and it could have a lot more of pictures.I recommend for anyone that want to know the varieties and the history behind the gentleman dressing style"
3,Does the job,"I like a 5-foot leash better than the more common 6-footer. I bought this to replace another that I had lost, and it's fine. The one I used to have had a padded hand loop, though, and this one doesn't, which I miss."
3,Normal/Stock Camshaft,"I bought this Melling camshaft without really looking to see if I could find the cam specification card. I figured that I would find that information on the cam card enclosed with the cam. Know what? No cam card came with the cam. I need the specifications card to properly build my engine, therefore, I'll have to contact my local machine shop and see if they can help with finding that information.To all those interested, be careful about what you purchace from Amazon sellers. They mean well, but tend to fall a little short sometimes."
4,"Original, Informative, Long,","Washington DC was a thoroughly planned city - it did not evolve haphazardly. Those who have looked at a map of DC spot immediately the symmetry that structures the City. This book is a well-researched argument that behind the city structure lies a Masonically-inspired tribute to Virgo. I enjoyed parts of the book, but found that it presumed familiarity and/or sympathy with astrology and could have used a more thorough editing process (I found the book jumped around a lot and I had trouble following some of the themes. I would recommend this book to those who live and work in Washington DC who always suspected there was something suspicious behind the symmetry, but who also have the ability not to get bogged down too much in astrological arcana."
3,More Astrology Than I Ever Wanted to Know,"I was drawn to this book by its title. After a good start with the early history of the planning of the capital by George Washington and L'Enfant, including freemasonic influences in the foundation stone ceremony and the cornerstone ceremony, the author zeroes in on what is to be the main thrust of the book, his analysis of the astrological signage scattered around the capital area and what that might mean. Perhaps George Washington, L'Enfant and the early capital architects were into astrology, I don't know. Perhaps the sign Virgo has some supernatural significance for the well being of the capital and the country, I don't know. I do know this, one needs to believe in astrology for this book to have credibility for them. To make a long story short, the book was a disappointment to me."
2,Very hard to follow...,"Honsetly only read through the first few chapters. It was difficult to follow....the author jumped back and forth between timelines. If you can follow it, I'm sure there are some good facts there....but I couldn't keep up."
1,Hogwash,There is not much to be said about this book except that it is total hogwash. Not even the author can pull all of his undocumented assumption together into a sensible hypothesis.
3,Not the best,"Comprehensive in some ways, this book overlooks some of the most dramatic examples of the secrets clearly encoded by the designers of our capital city."
3,mediocre,This book was okay and had most of the basic information. After the first 4 chapters I got bored. I guess I'm looking for more in depth information and not something I can find in any book I pick up.
2,GET TO THE POINT!,"This was one of the few books that drove me to sleep some times and bearly awake at others, You either LOVE it or HATE it and frankly it is only good to drive Owls to sleep at night. It is not JUST a yawner but it was so sereal it didn't seem like historical fiction at all it remains a tail of a un mentaly balanced father with a screwy daughter that needs a labotomy. In short this book could of used more refining because it is way off!PS:GET TO THE POINT!"
5,A Great WWII Novel,... The story of Patty Bergen when she's only 12 is a great story and actually quite believable. I really recommend reading it.
3,Summer Of My German Soldier,"Summer Of My German Soldier is a well-written book about a young girl during WWII. The main character, Patty, is faced with many conflicts not necessarily related to the war. It is a little depressing, and not a book I would recommend for a fun read. It was hard to get into, and it was boring until the end. If someone were to ask me if they should read it, I would tell them that there are better books out there."
4,I loved this book,"This book was a compelling story of a young but lost Jewish girl that didn't know where she belonged. Her parents did not love her, but to keep a good name in town, kept her around. She befriended a natzi prisoner and with the help of her loving cook, Ruth, kept her secret friend hidden from the world that rejected her and found a love that would always be remembered and never replaced. And if your reading this I DEFINITLY recomend this book!!!"
2,Read For Spainish,"Would it ever be excepted during World War II for a Jewish girl to befriend a Germain? How about a Nazi? This book is all about breaking the rules and following your heart. Patty comes from a family where the only person who loves her is their maid Ruth. But, that all changes on day when she is working in her father's shop and some of the POW soilders come in and she meets on who is not like the rest. He is handsome, smart, and extremely liturate. After that one time meeting all she can think about is him. One night she sees' him going and trying to hope a train and see calls to him and he comes to see her. She then hides him in her garage. She then sees' an add in the paper saying that Anton was missing from the camp. She was questioned by agents. So will she tell them everything they want to know? Or will she save her Germain soidier?"
1,Weak,"I detested this book. I felt the actual story never quite matched up with its admittedly interesting premise. The character of Patty Bergen seemed feeble and weakly developed, and I never understood the inexplicable hatred the entire world, excluding Anton and Ruth, seemed to have for this girl.The whole ""love story"" plot was laughably unrealistic, due mainly to the age difference. The most frustrating thing about this book is that it could have been so much better. The whole irony of a Nazi and a Jew falling in love during World War II has so many options for a good plotline, but instead the story seemed to spend a good majority of the book wallowing in self-pity."
3,Kind of weird,"This book was a little bizarre. Not much fact was included, and it seems like we don't know much about Patty. Also, I didn't really like her. Her romance with Anton was pretty weird and kind of inappropriate. At least Anton seemed to regard her as a friend, until the very end. However, a few themes in the book were brutally realistic, like racism and corporal punishment. It was a sad book, and an OK read."
1,Crud,"Boring. Pointless details. Unbelievable. If I were a young girl aroung the time of the Haulacust, I would not help a German. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
2,This book is utterly boring,"My HONORS 9th grade English teacher made us read this incredibly boring story. Here's a hint, when you make a book called ""Summer of my german soldier"" INCLUDE THE DAMN GERMAN SOLDIER. I'm telling you read something better like ""When Zachery Beaver came to town"" way better. This book is pointless and boring. undefined characters, pointless details, FICTIONAL information on WWII."
1,Very poor resolution,"As the book progresses, the storyline builds until, at the end, it goes straight down. There was absolutely no resolution. In short, it was the worst book I ever read. (And I read a lot)"
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read,"This is the sappiest, most poorly written, manipulative crap I've ever read. It somehow redefines the laws of mediocrity. The story is cliched and contrived. The characters are like cardboard. The love story is perverted and it celbrates a young girl's ignorance. This is a bonafide chick book. If you are a guy click the back button on your browser and walk away. If not well maybe you might like it but that still doesn't make it good."
3,Blah....,"This book is OK, I had to read it for school. It was bearable, but I wouldn't have read it if I had a choice. First of all, I'm not interested in World War 2, and secondly it seemed unrealistic for a realistic book. There were a few exciting parts, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,""" HELP ME!""","""This book was very boring. I had to read this book for a cause. If I could have choose another book I would have sais 'OKAY! ANYTIME, ANYDAY!!!' I say this because I thought it would get better in the end, but instead it got very boring."
4,Have loved this book for years,I first read this novel after I saw the movie with Kristy MacNichol back in the 1970s. I am now an English teacher and have taught this novel twice to my eighth graders; I will be using it again this year. I'm doing this online review to illustrate to my students how it's done! I think it's a great way to go public in a real-life writing situation.
3,Joe's review,"Summer of My German Soldier is about a young Jewish girl who is neglected by her parents and alone until Anton, a German soldier who is being held as a POW, is brought to her town. But now she is doing something against everything she is supposed to be for. She is hiding him away to keep him safe and unharmed. She knows if anyone finds out that her life is over. But this cannot overcome the power of love. I thought this book was OK because the excitement was few and far between."
3,"Good, but missing something.","I think someone said this before that the book is called ""Summer of my German Soldier"" yet the german soldier is only in a few chapters of the book, which is not exactly what you would expect and kind of leaves something missing. Even with that though, it is a pretty good love story with the irony of the younf jewish girl falling in love with the german soldier, and what happens to the girl at the ending is defintily something that is not expected as you reas through it."
4,Heartwarming- - - Practically puts you in the story,"A Jewish girl and German Soldier?? During the Holocaust that would've never been thought of. Patricia Bergen, who goes by Patty, goes through basically her whole life being criticized by her parents. Either her hair isn't perfect or she doesn't wear the very BEST of clothes, but the one perfect thing about her is her personality. When a German Soldier comes to her father's store, a friendly, yet upmost important relationship comes between them. She does everything in her power to keep them together. I give this story four stars! It puts you in the shoes of Patricia Bergen. But what happens,...is for you to find out."
3,The Summer of my German Soldier,"This is a histroical fiction book about the Nazis, in World War Two. This book is very good, though it has a sad twist. I recommend it to mostly girls, but there may be some boys who would enjoy it. :)"
2,'Summer' a flop in required reading,"I had to read this book for a project in reading class. This book was very hard to understand, especially in the scenes where her father beats her. The plot was adequate, but ther seemed to be little chapters that contributed to the plot of this book. The climax was not all that exciting for me, especially since my brother and sister have talked about it and read it. The descriptions of characters were little, partly because of the book's first person narroration. There are also some discrepancies in this book that left me asking too many questions at the end of the story. I enjoy books that leave me asking little or no questions at the end. It was also historical fiction, which is a popular genre to teach. I don't care for it"
4,Summer of My German Soldier,"Patty Bergen, a 12 year old jewish girl, who shelters and feeds Frederick Anton Reiker, a german soldier who escaped a prisoner camp. At the same rediscover what a true friendship means and loses the love of her loved ones. Does Patty risk everything she has for one man? Well we'll say no more.You must read Summer of my German Soldier."
4,Patty a Jewish girl befriends a German Soldier.,"I thought this was an excellent book, very sad. It shows the power of friendship. I'm a christian, I believe that the Germans were very decieved, I think that Patty Bergen had alot of courage to do what she, even though she was just a fictional character. Doesn't Jesus love every body, I still think the Germans were wrong, but they can still be forgiven, thats what this book shows."
2,I Didn't really like the book,It was a Ok book not the best close to the worst the school made us read it it might of been better if we weren't forced to read it
2,A Boring with a German Soldier,"Although at first glance the book seems to have a good plot, it does not. I didn't like the character of Patty, she seemed so pathetic and she whined too much. The relationship between Patty and Anton is very disturbing, becuase Patty is weird about how she reactes when she is around Anton. The book disturbed me."
5,The Best Book I've Evor Read,"I've read meany books. I didn't realy think i had one favorit until ""Summer of my German Soldier""It made me laugh. It made me cry. I grew to know the crectors, 5to love or hate them, I aprecate my faimaly and all I have. some of you might be thinking ok this is a love story. It's that but it's so much more."
3,A book I read,I am reading The Summer of My German Soldier.I like it because it is set during World War Two. I also like it because it is about a Jewish girl and a German an during World War Two.
4,Review`,"Summer of my german soldier is an exallent book. I read it at age 13, and it was a page turner. I would definatly recomend it. You get a slight history lesson, but not too much. I wont ever forget Anton and Patty!"
3,I dont get it...,"hi, when i was reading this book... it was a little hard to understand, it was one of my summer reading books and i was so over-whelmed with work that i didnt quite get the details of the plot, if you could send me a detailed summary to help me out, that would be great! thank you again! kay"
1,Exciting War Story? (You wish!),"Summer of My German Soldier is an average book. It is kind of romantic so I didn't like it that much. But that's just me. When my reading teacher first introduced this book, I thought it would be the best war book I had ever read. (This is because I am a huge war buff.) Before I even started reading, I was imagining an action-filled, danger at ever turn, war book. I was soooooo wrong! After reading the first few pages, I immediately became bored. I just hope that the sequel, Morning is a Long Time Comming, is better."
3,Good but...,"Summer Of My German Soldier, is almost a 1940's version of the Tale Of Two star-crossed Lovers, ""Romeo and Juliet"". The only difference being that Romeo and Juliet were both minors, whereas Anton and Patty's relationship would now be known as Statutory Rape. Other than that..nice plot, sad ending. Good book all around."
3,It was an all together ok book,I think the book should be for an older age group than 9-12 it was advanced for that age group. I think it was a very good book up until the end. I think i missed something cause i really didn't understand the ending. But i know i lent my book to my aunt and she cried and thought it was a very good book. I read Summer of My German Soldier for 9th grade High School and i barely undrerstood certain parts.I liked it though inspight of those few things!!
5,A splendid book about growing up in America during a war.,"This wonderful book stole my heart away. Patty Bergen, the main character, is so realistic you find yourself thinking that she is going to jump right off the page and come to life. This book is suberbly written and shows the tragedy of war and how it affects people. The ending was so wonderfully written, introspective, and sad that I couldn't stop crying for a half hour!!"
3,Crash & Burn,"Due to the Libertines being put ""on hold"" for the time being, Crash Convention ought to replace Barat & Co. as the NME's new favourite band. A Side `The Watch Committee' is a catchy 2-and-a-half minute rocker, a cross between The Clash and The Ordinary Boys, whereas AA Side `Thick As Thieves' is a punkier number with the frenzied vigour that made the aforementioned Libertines so successful. Nothing groundbreaking though."
4,Good,This is a nice trainer but it's noisier than expected. It's also not that convenient to put a bike in and take it out but if you can leave it up somewhere and not switch bikes very often it will work well. Overall we are pleased with it.
3,"Great trainer, but loud.","I love this product, it is great, but to be able to exercise at home and watch tv makes it a struggle. The product is a bit loud, which makes you want to turn up the tv. So forget doing this during ""baby's"" naptime!"
4,Nice bike trainer,"I am quite pleased with this bike trainer, but there are some drawbacks. At first, I was bothered by the loud noise it made when I tried to watch TV with it. However, I later changed the tires on my bike to much smoother tires without treads which made the bike trainer/bike much quieter. One other thing that slightly irritated me was the fact that the bike trainer does not have adjustable settings like some other bike trainers have to make it easier or more difficult to pedal against. Nevertheless, I still think this is a great product because of the great price and the ease with which the bike trainer can be initially setup."
4,Good,This was a present for my boyfriend. He seems to like it. It arrived in a very reasonable time. It seems to be very sturdy and easy to operate.
4,interesting and unique,"Little America starts from an interesting concept, the son of a CIA officer wants to understand what he saw growing up. And is written in an unusual style - mixing past and present even within sentences. These two together are both the strength and the weakness of the novel.In having it told by the son as he investigates the life of the father of 50 years earlier, the story often loses the immediacy of a thriller. It ends up being more of a mystery of the son uncovering the past than a spy novel. But there isn't really much mystery to solve, and consequently, the final revelations, though surprising, fall somewhat flat.Nevertheless, it is well written and seemingly well researched and offers important insights to the world of Middle East politics. Overall, it succeeds as a literary novel about a son trying to understand his father, even if it isn't quite the thriller that seems to be promised."
2,Thriller?,"I've seen this book referred to twice as a ""thriller."" In what sense I would like to ask. Yes, the writing is elegant in spots, and, yes, a bit ""quirky."" But thriller? I think that would be a stretch."
2,Disappointing,"Fine as an introduction to Duncan, but not for serious study. At best, this is a ""Greatest Hits"" record--though that said, it's a bit like buying Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. It's good in that it touches every portion of his career, but since Duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of ""the book of poetry,"" ultimately it leaves the reader wanting."
5,Selected Poems,I am much satisfied with the book and its dealer's rapid service. I would like them to send a receipt as soon as possible.
2,Bad quality zipper,"We outgrew our 8x8 tents with the kids, so we bought this tent preparing for our next camp trip. We test it out at our back yard right after we bought it. It's easy to set up, and roommy. However, the zippers are done in very low end quality. The window zippers work ok, but both the door zipper did not work well! The mesh zipper will open up after you zipped it. The door zipper is not well stiched on one side! And it's hard to zip it around.We are return it back to the store tomorrow!"
1,washout,"This was given to me as a gift so I am not ungrateful . However the 600 mm waterproofing it states is not even a minimum allowance for being water repellent . I would not chance this thing in a light sprinkle and the bottom stitching is so loose you can see daylight between some parts. There is no logic in spending time seam sealing this tent ... the seams would be the only thing keeping the water out, the rest would come right through the fabric walls itself.This is kind of an expensive tent ... you wouldn't have to look too far to find a smarter option . If it does not have at least a 1000 mm rating then you will get wet ...and that is a fact . I cannot even image what this thing would do in the wind ... the thin poles are worse than the usual ones they put on the cheapest tents.You have my sympathy if you pay over 30.00 dollars for this tent ."
4,This CD Rules!,"This CD is awsome! It has tons of great artists and really good remixed songs. It's perfect for partys where theres lots of energy and people are dancing. It is targeted for people who enjoy pop music and I'm surprised that no body has revieved it before! I had this CD but it was misplaced and I absoloutely loved it although I did get tired of the Eminem remix after a while. The oridginal ""My Name Is"" was soooo much better!"
5,amazing machine,"I absolutely love this thing. I use it constantly, for both rice and oatmeal. It almost has a happy little personality of its own. The rice it makes is delicious, with a texture that is not achievable by boiling in a pan. I am pleasantly surprised - extremely convenient if you like to eat rice. These folks seem to have thought of everything. Even the measuring is made simple. The pan is very easy to clean; the buttons are logical and not hard to learn. I especially like putting my oatmeal on the timer so that it is all nice and hot, ready for me when I wake up. I can't say enough good things, and I am not a person who likes to have appliances cluttering up my kitchen."
5,This rice cooker rules,This rice cooker cooks perfect rice everytime...and it can keep the rice perfect for a day or so. Spend the extra $$ and get this one. 1 cup....10 cups....dont matter....it always does a great job. Very high quality product.
4,Mixed Feelings,"The rice cooker has a lot of functions that we love!! Mostly we like all the automated settings that it has. The ""throw the stuff in there and start at a certain time"" is awesome! Especially because the housekeeper can prepare the rice for us and set it to start cooking later on that day. The little chime that it plays when the rice is done is really cute. Sometimes the rice is a little hard for our hispanic taste...perhaps, that texture is fine for other cooking styles. It takes soooooooooooooooooooooo long to cook. We like making the rice mushy like our cuban parents made for us which takes a long time. It is a really nice size, especially if making large amounts of rice is necessary in your kitchen. It is perfect for when we have guests. The design is cute but it does take up a lot of counter space. Overall, if I would be purchasing one again, I might not opt for this one but i'm not completely disatisfied."
1,BEWARE!!,"I need to preface this review by saying that I never received myZojirushi NS-ZCC18 from Amazon. Twice they sent me the oldermodel, the NS-ZAC18 instead. All the while their website claimsthat they have plenty of inventory, and that it ships within24 hours. Repeated calls to Amazon get plenty of sympatheticresponses, but no action. THE BOTTOM LINE: Amazon advertisesproducts that it does not actually carry.This seems to be a common theme with Amazon recently, somethingtantamount to a bait-and-switch. It also occurred when I orderedthe ""Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" and had to wait a week for itto ship, even though they claim it was in stock. I finallyreceived an e-mail that there was an unspecified ""problem""with the order. I called Amazon and was told that they had justreceived a couple copies and one would be mine -- remember, thewhole time before this their site claimed ""In Stock, ships in 24hours"".Not good business practice."
1,Broken on Delivery,"Took it out of the box. Read instructions. Added rice and water. Plugged it in. Greeted with a ""U01"" staring at me from the display.Manual says ""breakdown"" Called customer service. Authorized dealers listed on a separate card. No dealers for Nevada (and many other states). Instructions say unit must be packaged (certain way) and postage paid befor sending it in for repair.I'll use my $10 pan for future rice cooks, and toss this $200 piece of junk in the trash bin. For this kind of price, they should drive to my home in a limo. I was very stupid to spend that kind of money on this rice cooker...don't you be."
5,rick astleys greatest hits,"I think this is a must have album for any dance music fan of any age I love the music and the words are quite catchy and memorable i find myself singing some of these tunes around the house.. ENJOY it's a no brainer.. Vernon E. Boardman Portsmouth, NH"
3,Rick Astley - Greatest Hits,"While I was able to listen to a couple of my favorite songs over and over, I think I would have preferred to download the two songs rather than pay for the whole CD. Most of the other songs were unfamiliar to me and began to sound repetitive."
4,First US Compilation,"This is the first Rick Astley compilation in the US, and it covers all his chart hits in the US and UK from 1987-1993. Good, 2002 up-to-date liner notes with chart (US and UK) information, photos and solid sound. This is a perfect CD for Astley beginners and fans who want all the hits in one place."
3,"All His Hits, Together Forever","Back in the late '80s, Rick Astley caught a lot of (undue) flack for his music, but everybody was secretly entranced by the infectiousness of his singles. His two biggest--""Never Gonna Give You Up"" and ""Together Forever""--are obviously included on this Greatest Hits collection, and that will keep the casual fan satisfied. However, Astley had a few more aces up his sleeve as a listen to this album proves: The groove-driven ""When You Gonna"" is worth checking out, as is the oddly catchy ode to broke-heartedness ""Giving Up On Love"". The album sleeve also contains a mini-bio and USA/UK chart positions for his songs; neither are all that essential, but they're both fun.Grunge music effectively killed Astley's career, and as such he's usually nothing more than a footnote in musical history. But for a few years in the late '80s, back when pop music ruled the world, Rick Astley was a star, and this hits collection will show you why."
3,Wordy yet Witty Way of the World,"This is a very difficult, yet witty play. For those not familiar with English Restoration comedy of manners, it may seem VERY long. However, the play does have its moments of brilliant repartee, such as the ""contract scene"" in Act 4 between Millamant and Mirabell. It is probably William Congreve's finest work, but is only a must-read for theatre historians and lovers of 18th century British literature."
1,Congreve Has No Clothes,"Most great literary narratives, whether fiction or drama, boast simple plots and complex characters. This play turns that approach on its head. Here, we have a hopelessly and needlessly convoluted plot with the most superficial characters imaginable. Great drama? There is no drama. Great comedy? It's not funny. In short, it's garbage. Perhaps this kind writing was impressive in its day, but those days have long long passed us by. Why can't readers just admit that some so-called classics don't deserve the name? In reading the positive comments here, one can't help suspecting that the reviewers have been cowed by the play's reputation. It's a very rare reader who would find Way of the World anything but tedious, confusing, frustrating, unfunny, and overrated. People, let go of your pretensions and just say it! Sheesh...!"
2,WAY OFF ON HOW WIDESPREAD THIS STORM REALLY WAS,"THIS BOOK MISSES ONE IMPORTANT FACT. HURRICANE KATRINA DIDN'T STOP IN BILOXI/GULFPORT MISSISSIPPI, BUT ALSO INCLUDED CITIES FURTHER EAST THAT NEVER RECEIVED MENTION BUT FARED JUST AS BAD IF NOT WORSE THAN GULFPORT OR BILOXI. THIS INCLUDES THE CITIES OF OCEAN SPRINGS, GAUTIER, PASCAGOULA IN MISSISSIPPI AND AS FAR EAST AS MOBILE ALABAMA. IF TIME IS GOING TO PRESENT AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF HURRICANE AS SUCH IT DESERVES I WOULD THINK THEY COULD AT LEAST DO ENOUGH RESEARCH TO FIND OUT ABOUT THESE CITIES AND INCLUDE THEM IN THEIR BOOK. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE THESE CITIES ARE SO SMALL THEY FIGURE WHY BOTHER. AND MAYBE THAT IS WHY IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THESE SAME CITIES TO RECEIVE AID AFTER THE DEVESTATION CAUSED BY HURRICANE KATRINA. WHATEVER THE CASE, THIS BOOK MISSES THE WHOLE POINT."
2,Biased reporting,"This book, like most written and portraying Hurricane Katrina, leads the reader to the conclusion that New Orleans is the only area devastated thereby. For anyone's information, New Orleans was on the West, or weak, side of Katrina. New Orleans was flooded because: 1) elevation there is about 7 feet BELOW sea level and 2)their levy system has NEVER been built to withstand cat 3 or greater storms. EVERY drop of rain that falls in New Orleans has to be pumped out, one way or the other. If the citizens of New Orleans had put more money into improving their levy system instead of the SuperDome, they might very well be living in dry and undamaged homes today instead of morning their dead and trying to put their city back together. New Orleans will be rebuilt someday and I hope and pray that they have learned and benefited from this disaster and won't make the same mistakes again. If you want to read and look at a balanced book coverning Hurricane Katrina, this isn't it."
4,"Good, but too short","The series is good, but it seems like it would have been better at 24 episodes since it's pretty dense and doesn't cover everything in the game.Note that this only covers the first game in the series.It's good to have along side the game to help follow along with the extremely dense plot in the game."
3,a little too thin for my gaps,"Great product for most I'm sure, but I would have appreciated slightly wider bristles. Delivery was very prompt."
3,Tough on the gums,"The plastic can cut your gums if you're not careful. Many times the only way to get between teeth is near the gum. Also, the brush end bends easily if your teeth are close together, which I guess mine are."
3,"Good value, not best product",You get a lot of them for the money but the soft tipped ones hold up better and aren't as gnarly on the gums.
5,good stuff,This does wonders for teeth and gums.First time I ordered although I used it often when in N.Y.where relatives introduced me to this product.
4,"Good, just be careful","I usually use the Soft-Picks, but purchased Brushpicks because the pricing is much better. First time I used one, I poked my gum. Ouch!So I'm more careful now and they do work well. I have a broken tooth waiting to be fixed in a month. It collects whatever I eat and the Brushpicks do a great job of cleaning it out.I do like the case. They do not spill and dispense easily."
5,Love this Product,When I am feeling lazy I love that these are quicker and easier than flossing. If you're careful they do the trick every time (but don't tell your dentist - he'll say they hurt your gums ...sure- if you use them like a pick axe...). Only problem: I can't find them anywhere - likely they are too good a value. You get a lot of them for a small price - so I'm guessing that's why my Walgreen's stopped carrying them in favor of fewer for more. I tried to order them online through amazon but it was about $20 to ship a $2.99 product...
4,Easier than flossing,"I have used dental picks for years, I have found them to be better than flossing and much easier to use. These dental picks have a new wrinkle for me, one end is brush-like and it is really useful for getting under bridges where food has a tendency to accumulate. Nice product."
3,Ouch!,"Yes, They are cheaper than G.U.M.'s. Cheaper is NOT always better. Will pay more in the future and buy a different brand. Also, the bristles on the brush are only on 2 sides and not spread out around the whole brush."
5,Healthier Teeth,I found Doctor's Brush Picks several years ago & fell in love with them. I find them gentle & easy to use which translates to my be able to keep my gums healthier. Unfortunately I can no longer find them in stores. The price on Amazon is good & being able to purchase in a larger quanity is a huge plus.
3,Okay,"I would love these if they would be made in some softer rubber, but plastic for the brush side seems really harshOverall I think it is a great price for the amount that you get. However, I am not sure yet if I will reorder these when we are done with them. I think the idea is great though."
5,The best,"These brushpicks are the best on the market. A friend got me started on them and I used to buy them at a chain store, but now they don't carry them anymore. I could not find them anywhere until I looked at Amazon. I am so glad the Amazon still carrys them. Please Amazon, always carry this one product."
5,GREAT toothpick ... especially when you have a bridge,Love these toothpicks -- makes well and very functional ... have a bridge and this toothpicks works great / highly recommend.
3,The tip is too sharp.,The tip is too sharp.the brush is not round. I think this product is so so only.I will pass next time.
4,Handy help,"These picks are effective, very handy and come in a compact container from which they are easily removed, but won't spill."
5,Outstanding product,"I purchased this product as a replacement for a more costly one. It performed perfectly and, for the price, is hard to beat."
1,seachoice stainless rod holder,I ordered it from amazon and it came quickly but when i opened the package it looked nothing like the picture in amazon. Then when i used it the plastic at the bottom broke out and it riped the foam on my brand new penn rod. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Save your money.
1,not worth it,I bought this tape in hopes of helping me out in school more.When watching this tape the camera position was bad on one side.The lady in the video was repeating everything again and a again.I didnt learn anything out of this video i think it was a waste of money.
5,All that it said it was!,"This is such a little dust bag that holds an important part of your sanding life. The bag is made well and functions exactly like it is supposed to. Although it is a little pricey, it is necessary to have."
1,Poor Design,I would not buy this product or reccomend it. It is designed poorly and the different attachements don't stay on the charger. Disapointed withmoney spent
5,Bike Rack Genius,This bike rack could not be any easier to use. The simple design fits my SUV perfectly. Very happy with this product.
5,"Easy to use, sturdy","It's surprising how easy it is to strap this onto my Prius and pull it back off. It only takes about 2-3 minutes to put it into place, and the same again to put two bikes on it. It took a bit of getting used to how the tie straps work, but once I did, it's quick and easy. The rack is also very light. But the bikes stay very firmly in place. We drove four hours with these over both small state roads and interstate highways, and the bikes barely wobbled, we never feared them sliding or falling off."
4,"Solid choice, Excellent Customer Service","After extensive research of reviews, I purchased a Saris Bones 2 for our car . The Saris rack is versatile and well-designed. It even has stickers where you can record your optimal angle (of the rack) so you can have a quick setup in future uses.It can be hard to get the bikes on and the bike-securing straps are hard to pull, but you get used to it. I called to ask for a longer stabilizer strap which they are sending for free. Their customer service is top notch."
5,Works great!,PROS:Takes 5 minutes to install or removeFine in all weatherLooks coolSturdyCONS:Front tire is permitted limited movement (using a $2 bungee cord to secure it works well)No way to secure the bike or carrier with a lock for security
3,Sturdy but Flawed Design,"I don't love this bike rack. I bought it for my hatchback, and it's nice that the angle can adjust to fit my car. It also doesn't scratch the car at all with the rubber pads and coated strap hooks, which are both nice features. But the arms don't lock into place very well. You just have to tighten these little knobs down the best you can. I wish they would click or snap into place. Then they wouldn't wiggle lose and always require tightening. The cinch straps are also awkward to tighten down, and don't work great on bikes with cables running along the top, or really skinny frames. There's a plastic molded piece for both bikes that's supposed to let you strap in your front tube too, but it's in the wrong place, especially for the shape of my carbon frame road bike, so it ends up just being in the way and can scratch the frame. Over all it's a sturdy rack (very heavy!) but poorly designed."
4,So far so good,I've only used the bike rack once but it worked just fine. Easy to mount and steady on a long drive.
1,Worse customer service ever,"Interesting..., Bought a Bones 2, 2 years ago.., had issues with one of the arms; called to ask for the ""so called"" lifetime warranty..; the guy on the phone spent more time convincing me that the issue was MY FAULT instead of attending my request. Just bought a Thule Gateway 9007! exc!!!"
4,Not bad...,"Since I drive a hatchback ('04 Pontiac Vibe) with room for a couple of bikes in the back, I don't have a ton of experience with bike racks. I recently moved 300 miles to another state, and I needed that space for boxes of stuff. I considered buying a roof-mount system, but the minimal amount of use didn't justify the rather high buy-in price for such systems. A relative loaned me a used (not sure what brand/model) rear-mount rack, but I was pretty apprehensive about the low quality and instability of the loaner rack. I picked the Saris for its blend of affordability and stability, and I was not disappointed. It weathered 260+ miles of interstate and a good chunk of bumpy city roads without any problems. I loaded a heavier, steel-framed Surly Cross Check nearest the vehicle and a lighter, aluminum & carbon Trek road bike on the outside."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Don't use this rack on a nice car. I bought it to use with my ""beater."" I don't see how you could use this and not scratch your car. The 6 straps are going to pull on your trunk lid and the three rubber feet are going to alter your paint. I was not surprised or disappointed but want you to know. Also, my wife's hardtail (yeh, it's kinda funny) fit on the rack fine, but my full suspension Kona wouldn't fit on the rack even if I loosened the carrying arms and moved them in. So, yeh, I guess I am a little disappointed. Road bikes and hardtails with big, open frames will fit nicely."
1,Destroyed the Paint on my Spoiler Fin,"I followed the instructions to the letter, mounted the rack, put the bike on it, motored around, used the bike, put it back on, got home, took the bike off and discovered the coarse fabric and hardware rubbed the paint off my spoiler fin in two places. There were scratches where the hooks go in to the side of the trunk. The only way I could get the sides taut was to have the hooks in contact with the edges of the spoiler fin.If I were a new car owner, I'd be all lawsuity and Consumer Reportsy. But, my car is 9 years old and I touch park, so I just feel I need to opine here as a Cautionary Tale.If you have a new car, don't use this. Get something that mounts off your trailer hitch. The only reason I got this was that it was the only trunk mount rack available for my car. My car does not have a trailer hitch. I cannot use a roof mount because I cannot lift a bike over my head.In a nutshell. OK for a beater. Not OK for a new car."
1,Lost my Bike,The fasteners on this thing are awful. I was driving down the highway and after going over a bridge the bike flew off my car because the fasteners stripped and came undone.Spend more money on a nicer bike rack. Now I have to get a new bike and rack instead of paying maybe 50 bucks more and still having a bike.
4,Great product,Finally I found bike rack that fit for my car 1995 Toyota Celica. This mount rack goes over the spoiler. It's very sturdy to carry my two mountain bikes.
5,BONES!!!,"Extremely easy to set up, works on both my 2010 Acura TL and 2004 Pontiac Vibe. I wish the space between the bikes was a little bigger, but it is not an issue. I used dog collars to fasten the wheels of both bikes together so they didn't bang around on the expressway. I thought about buying the 3 bike model for the extra room but if you are only hauling 2 bikes this model will be just fine. We ride road bikes and this rack got them to and from our destinations with ease and scratch free. The fastening strips have a nice padded lining that secures the bike so it won't mess up the paint. Great product!!!"
3,Gets the job done,"Purchased this rack after much research, been using it for a year so far to get my bikes around. The screws that hold the arms in place once adjusted are made of a really cheap soft plastic and stripped out within the first month. The arms are also too thick to fit inside of the frame of my GT Force, I had to buy a seperate bar that connects stem to seatpost to make it fit on this. So check you full suspension to see if it will have room for these support bars before buying. Upgraded to a Thule metal rack recently."
4,Very robust stand,"I recently bought my first bike (Trek 3900) and was looking for trunk mount. Couple of local bike dealers suggested me this stand. Initially I was overwhelmed with the price of it. But later I realized that its a quality product and if I have spent $600 odd for my bike it would be worth to get a quality stand for it. I didn't wish to mount my bike to some cheap stand and repent later.The stand is robust but very light weight. When not in use, you can fold it to a very small size and store it easily. The quality of straps is really good.The only thing I have a concern for is that when you mount this to the trunk, there is no integral way to lock the stand to the car. I was hoping that it had a mechanism that enables to lock it to the trunk while being able use the trunk normally."
3,Stylish,"Certainly looks cool. It does leave paint scuff marks on bumper and trunk. Great for one bike. However, seems unstable with two bikes."
2,Bling Bling Not,"I was really disappointed in this item. When it said Bling Bling, I expected something that had rhinestones and glamour. I got it and saw only silverlike painting on it. Not glamourous for my 2 girls. I sent it back."
3,"Previn Plays, Dinah...Sings?","This is an intimate recording of standards by Dinah Shore and André Previn. André plays tastefully, with just enough variation to keep it fresh and not insipid.Dinah Shore is the unfortunate part. She may have been a lovely person with a warm personality, but unfortunately her voice by this time (she was in her mid-40's) is beginning to show a slightly out-of-control unpleasant vibrato. Because it's a duet, and it's just piano and a closely miked vocal, I have regretted my purchase of this album.There are enough great albums in this format, so I would give this a pass."
4,comprehensive,"It's huge, and slow going, but the book is quite detailed and generally clear explaining the concepts."
3,PCI Express System Archtiecture,In my opinion it is simply a re-write of the specification with no additional insight into the design of PCI Express hardware or software. In fact it follows the specification in the lack of design useful flow charts for hardware and the lack of detailed hardware figures. It provides little design information over what you can read in the specification and many of the figures are just those of the specification or look alike. The link states are done in the same manner as the specification with only minor additional information and there is no architectures of different ways the components can be built. It takes a lot of pages to explain some fairly simply concepts and wastes about 100 pages on third party information and restating waveform information from the specification. It has no glossary of terms and only a five page index.
2,not practical as a reference,"The index on this thing is worthless... The whole point of having a reference book, in my opinion, is to have quick, easy access to information when I need it. The point is not to have to read the book from cover to cover in order to find the information you need. Each time I try to get something out of this book, I get more and more frustrated.On one hand, there's the PCI-E spec, which is horribly written and incomplete, but completely searchable due to its being available in PDF form; on the other hand, you have this better-written but almost completely unsearchable book. Great."
1,Smells Sweaty,"I USED to LOVE this perfume and used for years. But the last two times I bought it from Perfume World or I give someone to use, I have noticed that it smells worse than sweat - horrible. I don’t believe this is the original perfume. Something somewhere is not right with it. But the original (real Paloma Picasso) was excellent. Everyone used to ask me what I was wearing and where to get it! My $60 down the drain! Next time will try to buy from Macys like I used to and see if I can get the original Paloma."
3,++Hmmmm...just OK++,"I thought this book was just OK, not bad but not terrific. I guess I'd read another one by this author."
3,misleading title.,"I ordered this book with the expectation that it would provide me with more specific information on the breed itself. Instead, there's only one chapter at the beginning of the book devoted to the history and temperment of the breed and the remainder of the book is buying, training, feeding, etc. (Note: many pages are very specific on treats and toys which I found overdone.) I had already ordered books that cover those issues and they were more helpful than this one. The title is misleading......I was disappointed in the book."
4,Atlantean Cargo Cult,"Peter Lawrence strikes a balanced tone in his account of the Madang 'Cargo Cults', considering it is a work of early to mid twentieth century. This book is cited by various authors (such as Frederick Errington and Deborah Gewertz) in the debate over the meaning of Yali's question - why does his people not have cargo, and why do these 'others' from beyond the sea have so much? Lawrence clearly has his own agenda and his own predjudices, but this is a highly readable account of a fascinating period in human history, one which is so visible to us in the Pacific, but may have been rehearsed in various guises at many periods in history. Pidgin English is itself a fascinating subject, of which I must learn more. It seems to work like an inverted mirror in which humans from industrialised societies cannot recognise their own reflection. Road belong Cargo, indeed."
2,SAMPLES OF ALL THE SOWS WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.,"ALL THE SHOWS ARE CUT NOT LESS THAN 15 MINUTES EACH. THIS IS A RIP OFF. WATCH IT ON YOU TUBE THOSE ARE REAL LONG ONES, THIS XENON PICTURES DVD SUCKS!."
3,Good for some laughs,"BAD movies! Ha! The DVD is fine. Good picture and everything. The movies, though... sheesh! Bad-movie buffs take note. These are some gems. The Seventh Planet ultra-lounge theme song is worth the price."
3,Exactly what you would expect.,"If you are a fan, as I am, of lousy 1950s C movies, you will enjoy these turkeys. If, however, you insist on well made, intelligent, thought provoking films, these two are certainly not for you."
3,Classic Bad Sci-Fi,Typical 50's C-film sci-fi with bad effects and bad acting. But it's still a lot of fun to watch!
3,"warning about ""journey to the seventh planet""","when i first saw ""journey to the seventh planet"" on tv, it was a very good sci fi movie and one of the best parts of the movie was towards the end when one of the astronauts attacks the brain and the brain absorbs the astronaut. they showed the astronaut being absorbed in the original movie, which was pretty grusome, but they show none of the absorbtion on the dvd. the best part of the movie and it was cut out. all you see during this part is the brain and you just hear the sounds of the absortion. too bad they lost this part."
5,B Movie Nirvana,i love these old B Movies. I remember watching these films many years ago and it;s a pleasure to see them again.
1,typical Buffet cover band dribble,"This group bills it's self as the original Key West the Band so I tried it out because I like that group.No contest!If I were Key West the Band I would sue for misrepresentation!I tried listening to this music but it was tough to make it all the way thru.Bad, clique lyrics and songs.The singer is good but can't make up for the horrible songs and grainy recording techniques.Maybe next time -- but I doubt it."
1,THIS MUSIC SUCKS,"THE WORST CD I'VE EVER BOUGHT.I BOUGHT THIS CD BASED ON ALL OF THESE RAVING REVIEWS THAT YOU'LL READ BELOW.I TRIED TO DOWNLOAD THE MP3 SAMPLES, BUT PROBLEMS WITH HARDWARE/SOFTWARE/AMAZON/AOL OR ALL OF THE ABOVE KEPT ME FROM FROM SAMPLING THIS PURCHASE.IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING.SOUNDS LIKE MY SONS GARAGE BAND TRYING TO PLAY BUFFETT SONGS."
1,Horrible read don't waste your time!!,"This book proves to be unconstitutional, I cannot believe John Yoo teaches at UC Berkeley, I would be ashamed to call myself a professor and a patriot writing a book like this."
1,Yoo's reasoning befuddled,"Professor Yoo's writing style is as nearly befuddled and confused as his understanding of a Constitutional law. I can say without fear of contradiction that this is by far one of the most ill-conceived, unsubstantive and pointless books I have ever had the misfortune to read. His theories and assertions are never clearly backed up with any real documentation or legal reasoning and he fails miserably in making any clear or concise point. I feel this book was nothing more that a total waste of time. Perhaps Professor Yoo should stick to writing legal arguments, where style and in his case substance, don't really matter."
1,Unsupported by the Constitution,"Yoo's arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the Founders intended when creating our great country. He is undoubtedly intelligent, given the prowess with which he manipulates the Constitution and legal precepts into seemingly supporting his own theory. Despite the packaging, however, the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed. He is, at his core, merely an opportunist who advocates theories for the sole purpose of furthering his own career, rather than because they actually have merit. In other words, he's just a hack at heart. This book isn't worth your time or money."
1,Freedom Hater,The author of this book hates freedom and his book is unsupported by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
3,not the original version of back of my hand!,"Well the cd is great and contains both albums,but the hit song of Back of my Hand is not the original mix/recording! For die-hard fans like myself just play the Island Records/usa LP or cassette version of Evening Standards, or the mini 12 inch lp or 45 single that i also have and you will know and hear this much better version! Lately cds on UK labels are putting out wrong versions, such as the power pop/new wave Korgis song Everybodys Got to Learn Sometime on the Edsel release of Dumb Waiters! oh well, collectors beware! other than that the JAGS rule!"
3,I Got Your Number: >>WARNING<<,"Just a note to my fellow skinny tie power pop fans. I listened to this whole cd at a local record shop. It wasn't bad; but I think you should know the cd's only hit: ""Back of My Hand (I've Got Your Number)"" is a DIFFERENT VERSION than the Island UK single (#WIP 6501, 6/79) that played on the radio. And, in this case, that's not good. The single version is SO MUCH BETTER. You can find it on Rhino's brilliant D.I.Y.: Starry Eyes: UK Pop, Vol. 2 You'll end up with a better overall cd too."
2,Not for Hydroponic Growers,"This book contains exactly one chapter on hydroponics and it's not a very good chapter. As a general book on growing, it's not bad, but anything that purports itself as being a ""grow bible"" should include extensive information on evaluating hydroponics systems and mediums and how to use and maintain them throughout a grow. This book contains some information on this, but not nearly enough. For whatever reasons, it includes far more information on genetics and breeding, but most growers I know buy clones or seeds. Those pages would have been better devoted to all things hydroponics.Is there a good book focused primarily on indoor hydroponic growing? Not sure I need it now, but it would have been great to have a few months back."
1,Evident Growing Errors!,"Some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers' garden section. There are EVIDENT growing ERRORS in this book. If you are a beginner or intermediate grower, this book may misguide your gardening efforts. If you want real facts, there are better sources out there."
5,Great Book,"The book was delivered in perfect condition and vey quickly. Having read the book I would totally recommend it. Informative, complete but maybe not ideal for a newbie."
3,Grow More/Over Grow,"If you already have a collection of the classic cannabis books for a solid foundation and are just looking to get another book to add on your shelf, then get this book too; otherwise, go to www.overgrow.com where you'll learn much more from true growers than this book contains. Being a true connoiseur and grower, I'd have to say that this book is not all it's cracked up to be: more hype and far too much self-promotion going on here for my taste buds."
5,Walkthrough.......................,"..................that packs lbs onto your harvest. Gains, gains and more gains. If I have any questions I turn to The Cannabis Grow Bible: the definitive guide to growing marijuana for recreational and medical use, because the answer is always in here and always top stuff. I have gone from respectable harvests to super sized gains. This is a walkthrough from start to finish that shows you all the pros and cons of doing it this way or that way. You get loads of alternatives on each of the growing methods. It even shows you how to build your own hydroponics if you want hydro. It is very cheap to grow an unbelievable bulk of quality skunk if you learn how with this book. I want to say thanks, thanks, thanks for the excellence that I found in here."
2,A for effort. Add a plus for pictures. And throw down a C - for content & clarity,"If you can't say something nice....Well, actually this book is not as bad as some reviewers have noted. Add it to your collection...fo'sho... but keep it all balanced with some resources from the mainstream gurus (like Cervantes & Rosenthal).I absolutely agree that the pictures are nice. It's not exactly the best step-by-step for simple information and getting started. For starters, I most like Jorge's simple methods of instruction. (Ed's also a good back up). Again, this book isn't a bad back up, too."
4,Good Information presented in a very simple manner,"Valuable resourse. Very easy reading. Lots of pictures and news clippings. A bit opinionated, but I liked it."
2,Not satisfied.,"We purchased this microwave in October for $300 minus the $50 rebate. Panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. A phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. However, I've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with Panasonic.The microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. However, there is a significant design flaw. You cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. After the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. The first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot I thought it was a short circuit. For that reason, I do not recommend buying this appliance. I wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically..."
3,Good but loud,The draw back to this model is the exhaust fan noise. I believe it is very loud. Other than that I was very please with the performance of the microwave.
1,"Nice features, poor reliability.","The first one we received was dead out of the box. It made a loud grinding and sounded like a fan hitting metal. We assumed this was due to shipping damage and received a replacement. The replacement worked fine for six months but suddenly the display panel would go blank and the clock would reset after a few minutes. The microwave has now ceased functioning altogether. The warranty states ""in-home"" service, but there are no local service facilities."
2,Does not smell like creme brulee,"I had high hopes for this perfume. I have previously used a creme brulee perfume from Bathwerks that was absolutely amazing, and I have yet to find a replacement for it. The Laura Mercier perfume smells artificial, and is cloying."
4,Just this..,The only disparaging thing I can say about this book is that it caused me to purchase a better dictionary.
1,Totally disappointing,"Sorry to say, although Roland Barthes is an icon to some. This short book is self-indulgent, unintelligible, and therefore useless. The author is far more interested in himself than he is interested in the subject."
1,Heavy going,"It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful."
4,Old Family Favorite,"My mother used this book over thirty years ago to name my sisters and myself -- and we still have the dog-eared/broken spined original, complete with circled, what-were-you-thinking, thank-God-you-didn't-call-me-that names. (Makes for a great keepsake.) I often use baby name books in my line of work and have at least five, but this one is by far the best: great definitions and ""foreign"" variations of common names put it above the rest, plus a surprisingly informative astrology section. I had to deduct a star, though, because even the latest addition neglects proper pronunciations, which is disappointing.Another good one: try The New Age Baby Name Book by Sue Browder if still in print; over 3000 African, Hindu, Arabic, Native American and Occult/mythological names. Enjoy, and happy naming!"
3,Appealing book,This book is at once appealing and helpful. It has a small horoscope section but those who do not relate to horoscope can easily skip or ignore them. The main lack is that there is no phonetic aid to help in pronouncing the names.
5,You can't go wrong with this....,"There is something about Amelia Bedelia that captures the attention of children, my 7 year old son can't get enough of her. If you want your child to discover the joys of laughter and fun in a book then you have to buy this!"
5,Good funny & silly books,My daughter used to read Amelia Bedelia books and LOVED them! I bought these for her daughter (my granddaughter) who also loves them and is learning to read. They are funny and silly books with good morals.
3,BADLY PLANNED,"I think this video would be fun if: 1. Donna had a ""how to"" section at the beginning or end of the tape. The moves are complicated if you don't have a dance background, and just as you think you might be getting the hang of it, she changes the move. She never slows down to show you what she's doing, and she goes from move to move very quickly! I have to wonder how much the team had to practice before filming. 2. The camera would not costantly move to the exerciser's upper bodies. If it wasn't already hard enough, you can't see their feet! I found this tape a little frustrating, but maybe with a little more work I can get it, and it will be fun. She is a good instructor, though."
5,If I could give it TEN stars I would,"I had so much fun working out to this video, when it was over I wanted to do it again. The routines are challenging, but it just makes it more fun to do. If you love to dance, you will love this video."
4,Fun getting back to aerobics,"I've done the video twice now and I can actually say I've enjoyed getting back to aerobics (had a baby and no time for the gym now!). The music is really fun (though different than I expected) and Donna's attitude just keeps you going.I felt a little spastic with some of the moves (been away from the gym WAAAY to long) but after the second run through I think I'll be moving right along on the next workout. Maybe it was just me but the queing could be a little better - - experienced aerobics folks shouldn't have any problems though.I'm looking forward to my next workout, how often can you say that! I'd say this is a great beginner or intermediate workout that easy to adjust to your ability."
4,Just Do It!,I truly enjoy this tape and I began to feel the benefits almost immediately. I'm motivated to exercise because she makes it fun. The steps are challenging but it is extremely rewarding when you get the routines down.
2,Very disappointed!!,"I didn't like the workout, Donna's teaching style and some of the music that was played in the background. She talks way too much. It only got my heart rate up very little. The workout was not fun at all! Save your money and invest in Tamilee's Tighter Assets or her ""I want that"" series. It is a much better investment."
3,"EEH,","Way to dancy for me. But in all honesty I've never gotten through the whole thing. I tried twice but each time after about 20 minutes I ended up taking it off and switching to another workout. I prefer the more straightforward basic moves like The Firm, Kathy Smith, etc. I don't have time to sacrifice a workout while trying to catch on to a dance routine. I'll sell this one. Also you need alot of room to execute the moves."
5,Very fun video and not hard to follow!,This is a great intermediate video. It's one of my favorites. It's set to Motown music and it's very fun. The moves are dancy but Donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down. I don't like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because I get bored to fast. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics. IT'S FUN!
2,Great music and instructor but hard to follow dance steps,"I bought the Donna-Mite tape based on the previous reviews and was very disappointed. While I loved Donna's personality and enthusiasm and really like the music, I found the tape VERY ""dancey"". Perhaps I'm a major klutz, but I just couldn't follow the steps. Every time I caught on, they'd move on to another step."
2,Dissapointed,"the first track is an edited version of 'Natural Blues', track 8 on play, and this version trims it down, and removes some of the bet parts of the song, it's like taking the soul out of music. I didn't like how they edited that track. Track 2, 'The Whispering Wind' seems very sad, but it gets boring after a while, and the way moby edited his voice on that gets annoying after a while.Track 3, 'Sick In The System' seemed odd for this single, but the song in itself i enjoyed the most out of all of the tracks on this cd."
4,Don't sleep...this brotha has crazy lyrical skillz!,"Yeah, aren't you tired of the so called rap music nowadays? Labels are springing up outta nowhere and putting out the same ole garbage. Let me tell you straight, it ain't entertaining when it sounds like something you could have made up. How long has it been since someone came off with some ill flow and you couldn't wait to learn the verses? ""The Arrival"" is still on point even six years after it's release. The big thing is when he spits, he's actually talking about something. People are afraid today to say when something is garbage. There are levels to attain too and being gifted with word flow is no small feat. Check out this slept on album and get back to some real hip hop.DJ Come of Age"
2,Not what I had expected.,"This is a *postcard* book. The Amazon description does not mention this particular bit of information. I was expecting *text* and art, but this is not what I received. Beautiful art, but--again--not what I had expected."
3,"Another One In Mass Marketing, But Okay","The undying love I felt for Seth MacFarlane and Family Guy has worn a little thin (see review of ""Partial Terms...""), and this toy, bluntly, is just okay. It's made like the millions of others he's licensed, sturdy unless you step on it and such, and it's cute. But the colors aren't that great, features aren't sharp, etc. - one thing that can be noted is that Jasper is more sensibly priced than many of the FG family. Okay -"
2,not for kids but ok for adults who like toys,"I brought this for my friend name Brian, for his birthday I figured he needed his very own Jasper!"
2,Not very sturdy!,I gently used this Kidsline Zanzibar Diaper Stacker for about a month and the bottom of the fabric just below the embroidered crocodile began to split and fray. I only filled the stacker half full with disposable newborn diapers simply because it dosen't look or feel that sturdy. The only reason I have the stacker is because it was purchased as part of the 6 piece set. I never would have purchased it separately if I had actually seen it alone in a store. I stopped using it after a couple of months because the fray in the fabric looks so bad. I have to say that I really don't think very much of this collection at all. It's attractive but not worth the money!
3,"Good on relating to other worldviews, but highly distorts true Christianity","I read this book enjoying it at first, but after moving out of dealing with eastern religions/relativism, I found myself in constant disagreement with him. He seems to embraces the Arminian error, which leads him to suggest ideas that require the use of philosophy over scripture.I really only recommend the first few chapters of this book, but when he moves into Christian apologetics, do yourself a favor and return the book to the library.Edit: Looking over some of my past product reviews, I noticed I called Copan a heretic, rather than (rightly) saying that he's only in error. I changed the language to reflect my growth in Christ when it comes to embracing those who are not in the Reformed tradition."
5,great book,"The author relates his experience to even the most novice hunter (myself). He has a scientific, common-sense approach to deer hunting that gives confidence in his methods and makes you want to use them. His section on deer vocalizations can be confusing, but who can communicate inarticulate sounds thru plain text... However, it is fairly easy to find recordings of deer calls on the internet to clarify this matter."
5,This book helped me bag a monster whitetail!!,"Thanks to Mr. Fidduccia's wonderfull section on Late Rut, I bagged a nice 12-point! To whoever reads this: I strongly recommend you purchase this book. It is well worth the money!!"
4,Get to know her and the time period,"This book is fabulous in terms of getting to know Diana Vreeland. Her sense of voice is impeccable, and she talks to readers as if they are right there in her house having casual conversation. She tells wonderful stories of the twentieth century that many people would find interesting. I liked that she talked not only about fashion, but also of important historical events. She tells of seeing Nazis, living through Prohibition, and even scandal in British royalty. That said, she does tend to jump from topic to topic. Her transitions are quick and spontaneous. I do wish she had spent more time on each of her stories. All in all, this book is great to read to get a great picture of the marvelous Diana Vreeland."
3,disappointing,"every song from the the movie is replaced with an inferior version by ELton John on this album, and the best score elements such as Discovering Eldorado and Climbing the Pyramid are simply not included. Possibly this was due to licensing issues with the original musicians. It gets 3* for the presence of some good tracks though."
4,Neat,"I like the CD, but it's nothing amazing. It's got pretty good tunes and although I do recommend it, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't buy it."
4,"""El Dorado...as good as gold""","Elton John returns with 11 very seductive tracks on this release. The melodies are strong and he sounds great! Particular stand-outs include ""Someday Out Of The Blue,"" which is the first single, ""Trust Me,"" ""My Heart Dances,"" and ""Friends Never Say Goodbye."" A few more EJ tracks would have been better than the instrumentals included at the end of the album. Overall this is a fine body of work. The first single is probably the catchiest of the songs on this release, and a good follow-up single to this one would be ""Trust Me."""
3,AMAZING SCORE not so good soundtrack,first i saw the movie and all the songs were amazing so i bought the soundtrack now i want my 14 dollars back because they changed the songs here i wish there is a CD for the original score so plaese dont buy this before listening to it
1,wanted a soundtrack not an Elton John record,"Some of the other reviews are correct, this is a great Elton John record. But I didnt buy it to listen to Elton John, I bought it to get the music from the movie.I am very disappointed. While Elton John is indeed a good artist, that is not why I wanted this. The makers of this cd have cheated me and anyone else who is a fan of the movie. They have set this up as a soundtrack to get your money, but instead it is nothing more than an Elton John music.Which is why it only gets 1 star from me."
1,Bad Songs Say So Much,"What a lousy soundtrack for a suprisingly fun movie. Some of the actual score pieces are decent, but NONE of Elton's songs on this album are worth even a brief listen. Save your money and buy ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" or ""Madman Across the Water."""
2,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...more soundtrack pop full from Elton and whereas The Lion King is a 1 star album this is 2 stars because we have double the fluff.
1,Rocket Man Where Are You........?,"Elton John had peaked as a songwriter in the mid 70's and was even able to tweak out a decent hit every now and then throughout the 80's and early 90's. Today, Elton John's music has become about as exciting to listen to as a trip to the shopping mall. His songwriting has become so formulistic and predictable that you can see him doing the Lion King Part X in about 20 years in a full blown Vegas style show. Elton is a legend whose status is much owed to the music he created more than 20 years ago. Today, it seems comical that this legend has become a comical parody of the ""I think I can still write a hit"" composer who seems to have an endless supply of the same 'adult(now Diseny)-contemporary' melodies with variations on a theme of schmaltz."
2,not what i had hoped,"i was thinking that this was a cd where the music was taken from the movie, not all resung by elton john. the songs lost the flavor i was looking for. if you're an elton john fan you probably would like it"
3,A golden Elton John feature,"Unfortunately, this was not the CD I was initially expecting. I had hoped it would be the full soundtrack to the movie, including the hysterical ""It's tough to be a god"". I was somewhat disappointed when that song in particular did not appear as it had in the movie. The scores were sweeping and most of the music was a delight, but I had truly hoped for some songs to remain unchanged.Overall, it was a good purchase and a fun CD to listen to. I would recommend it to any Elton John fan. He did a great job, especially on ""Friends Never Say Goodbye"" and ""The Trail We Blaze"". The energetic pop numbers are fun and entertaining. A great album, but with a few flaws in my opinion."
4,elton john's sound not sacrificed,"As a pretty keen follower of Elton's music, it was a nice suprise to hear the new album and to hear instantly a clear and deliberate return to the standards set by post 70's albums such as 'made in England', 'Sleeping with the Past', 2 low 4 zero and 'Ice on Fire'. There was no self indulgent introspection or experimentation, just music for the sake of music, with singable melodies and good thick chords. I agree with an earlier review that comments on his voice and piano being more prominent in the mix making a big difference. Great to hear the big fella having a go again."
5,Show tunes add to album!,"Our local reviewer said"" Show Tunes Diminish El Dorado!"" Excuse me, but I am reviewing the album,not the movie! I love this CD! And be it show tunes or not, I think it's great! I've listened to it for about 2 weeks now, and consider it one of my fav. Show tunes are in order, ""The Trail We Blaze"", ""It's Tough to Be A God"", But I also like ""16th Century Man"" which reminds me of New Orleans ""Funk"" , and I'm from South LA. Thanks , Elton John, for something new and refreshing! You win, in my book!"
4,Great album -- forget that it's a soundtrack!!,"The fact that this is a soundtrack for an animated movie is gonna turn people off, and it's too bad, because this is a wonderful and very sophisticated piece of work by an insanely talented person...It's also too bad that ""Somewhere out of the Blue"" was chosen to be the single released to radio. It may be the weakest track on the album. It's not horrible, but it pales against some of the others. The title track is great. ""Friends Never Say Goodbye"" is beautiful. ""16th Century Man"" is an absolute classic (with great lyrics by Tim Rice). And the others don't disappoint either.I loved the Lion King soundtrack... but collections like this, along with other recent soundtracks like ""Tarzan,"" deserve rightful places among the best works of their respective artists. It's great to see such outstanding music in these movies -- just unfortunate that so many will never get to hear them because of the cartoon characters on the cover."
4,Great Soundtrack,"Elton John has done it again. ""Someday"" is my favorite track. ""Friends Never Say Goodbye"" is another potential hit. John does a great job and the background vocals are incredible."
1,"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road - hello Shlocksville!","""El Dorado"" fails on all levels. Truly, this is a CD to avoid. Elton's fans should avoid it for the lackluster rhythms, simple chromatic melodies (if you can call them that)and banal Tim Rice lyrics and forced rhymes. Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like ""Circle of Light"" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of ""El Dorado."" There are no ballads like ""Can you hear the love"" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although ""It's Tough to be a God"" comes close. One last comment, I could buy the Spanish rhythms - after all the main characters are Spanish - but where the hell did the country/western sound come into the picture at all? Dreamworks, if you want to rival Disney, get Phil Collins to do your music next time."
3,I thought I might like it better after seeing the movie...,"...but I still think the music and lyrics are largely repetitive. After seeing the movie, I think the worst thing is that the Branagh/Kline version of ""It's Tough to Be a God"" was left off--I would have added another star just for that. I do like the soundtrack's version of ""The Trail We Blaze"" better than the movie's, and some of the other songs are pleasant. ""Without Question"" still seems somewhat out of place. Elton John fans will probably enjoy this album. Animated feature fans may want to skip it."
4,"Not exactly, but good anyway.","I'm not a huge fan of Elton John, but I loved this CD! I was hoping for more of the music from the movie itself, especially the Kline/Branagh version of ""It's Tough to Be A God"", but I was very happy with what I got. I do hope that Dreamworks releases another CD, with more of the score and the Kline/Branagh song, but I'm still very happy with this cd."
4,"""Can you hear the sound-alike..""","Great Elton John / Tim Rice collaboration.. It's bound to bebetter than the movie itself! My only complaint.. why do sections of""Friends never say goodbye"" sound SO MUCH like bits from ""The Madness of King Scar"" from Elton and Rice's ""The Lion King""? Major boo boo..Watch the sparks fly! Sorry guys.. but this little flaw overshadows the whole album.. pity.. cause it's bloody good stuff!"
3,Where's the soundtrack?,"I'm disapointed in this soundtrack release for the simple reason that it does not contain the actual soundtrack from the movie. Missing from the CD is the wonderful score by Hans Zimmer and John Powell, except for a couple of short tracks stuck on the end almost as an after thought it seems. And the orchestral accompaniment of Elton John's songs is sadly lacking as well. Also, for some reason there are songs on this soundtrack album that are not even in the film. I hope the folks over at Dreamworks will remedy the situation by releasing the ""real"" musical score of this film on a separate CD sometime soon. This is a CD for fans of Elton John, not for fans of movie music."
2,Not What I Expected!,I was disappointed to discover that this is not really a soundtrack from the movie. The only thing this CD has in common with the movie is the song titles. I would have preferred a combination of Elton John signing some of the tracks and the voice talents from the movie doing some of the others. This CD is more like Road to El Dorado set to elevator music. 2 thumbs down.
3,Love it,This is a great bag except my only complaint is the zipper to the main compartment. Because it only zips across and down one side it puts a lot of stress on the fabric around the corner. After I had my bag for about 3 months the fabric began to tear. I called JJ Cole and they were great. I mailed the bag back and they sent me a new one. Hopefully it will last longer. My favorite part is the seperate diaper pad. It works great by itself.
5,Love it,"Oh how I love this book!Vimala Thakar writes beautifully and gives you lots to think about.I bought this book as it was on the suggested reading list by OM Girl (its a blog). Then I went on to buy her other book on Raja Yoga. She is elegant and insightful and I am so glad I found her.I will keep this book forever and one day when I am a more skilled Yoga Teacher, I will use it in my class and read the quotes."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting much more from this video. It did have kids doing poses, but it was hard to find the 13 year-old. Some of the circle games looked like they might be fun. I wanted to show it to my third grade class, but I don't think it would hold their interest. All in all I felt I was watching someone's home video of their family doing yoga."
3,Reprints not as good has originals,"This copy is another reprint of one of the ""Green Book"" series so it doesn't contain any of the great maps that come with the originals."
3,annies review,This book ie okay but it is boring to Ilike some of it but some of it is confusing to me. There are a lot of people in this book and it is hard to keep up with all the people in the book. The pictures in the book are good too. They help you get a better picture of where the book is and what the people look like. The book is hard to understand but you get into it in the middle. Then it gets confusing again. There is a little boy who is with his father and his father is on a base for his army. The little boy gets to experience some things at a young age. One of the other good parts is that the title fits and it just tells what the chapter is going to tell you about. The book could be better but it is okay from where it is at. I am not an army freak so it was ok.
2,Very slow shipping,The book I ordered was a gift. I am sure they will enjoy reading it but it took a very long time to get here. Disappointed in that!
2,Disappointing,"I started to read ""The Greatest Generation"" in the hope that it would contribute to World War II history. I really cannot say it did. I also found it to be repetitive. I also challenge the notion of the World War II generation being the ""greatest generation"" because of the patriotism it displayed. We have had individuals display similar patriotism throughout our history, especially since World War II. A recent example is Pat Tillman, the Arizona Cardinal Safety who give up millions to join the Army Rangers and gave his life in Afghanistan. I also find it interesting that Mr Brokaw admires the World War II generation for its patriotism yet objected to his fellow journalists wearing the American flag."
3,"A Feel Good Book, but a weak historical text!","Brokaw does a good job of capturing the glory of the World War II era. He also discusses the shameful acts of our country during this period. However, this book is only valuable if all you want is a skinny look at these times. It is not valuable at all in teaching history because it glosses over issues and events. It is a good book, but not a Great book. For a great book on World War II, look elsewhere!"
2,Greatest Generation?,"Greater than all the other generations of Americans? What about the generations of men and women who formed this nation, built the states, towns, farms, died on the battlefields of the Revolution, War of 1812 and Civil War, and more. In short, what about the very people who made it possible for there to even be an American WWII generation? In my opinion, the WWII generation earns a different title: The Most Arrogant Generation. Remember they also gave us the Cold War, McCarthyism and Segregation. It was also men of the WWII generation who ""led"" the nation into Vietnam. (Some leadership!)Actually, what I think Brokaw meant to say, is that the WWII generation was the last great American generation. What a pessimist! Thank God for young folks!"
3,The Greatest Generation,"Some interesting stories if you like that period of American history. As for the title, I am reminded of a quote from Abraham Lincoln about his generation during the Civil War. ""Human nature will not change. In any future great national trial, compared with men of this, we shall have as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as good."""
5,Memories Come Alive,"My mom was appreciative of this gift. She has vivid memories of this time in our history and was pleased to receive the book- she says that at the time we were a united United States and will not ever see this agian , which is sad."
5,Purchased for my Dad,Thanks. I purchased this for my Dad. He was part of that generation. Many thanks!
3,A good account of those who influenced those of us over 55.,"As those of us who were born during ""the War"" look back upon history we realize how truly fortunate we were to have adults of that period as mentors, teachers, parents and friends. Brokaw does a good job of telling their stories. Some stories are similar and some portions are repeated and for those reasons the book tends to lose excitement. Not everything that is good is exciting, however. The book is interesting (I knew some of those people) and I would recommend it to any young person. If they read it, they will then know how many truly great sacrifices were made for us by those who were young adults during the war. A good book."
5,It's A Great Book,"A lot of reviews make the book's simplicity of style a negative. what a surprise since it doesn't read like textbook and in fact makes history more human, and to me, more significant."
2,Great expectations unfulfilled,"My father served in Europe during WW II. Like many other G. I.'s he returned home with a foreign-born wife. It was very disappointing that there was no mention of soldiers and their war brides in this book. The individual stories are good as far as they go, but Brokaw trivializes them with the same flowery comments repeated again and again. Some celebrity stories such as Art Buchwald's were very entertaining, but other celebrity names were mentioned without an account of the individual's experiences. Would you call that name dropping? I agree with all the other reviewers who liked the stories but found them pooly written."
1,"Great Generation, Lousy Book","Don't bother reading this book. Brokaw's sham will teach you nothing about the Second World War. Instead, read Studs Terkel's THE GOOD WAR or anything by Paul Fussell. Better yet, go talk to a veteran...We're lucky they're still around."
2,"Great topic, poor writing style","Tom Brokaw has chosen a fanastic topic: the Baby boomers' parents. Their life & times, trials & stamina through the Depression, war(s), and raising families. I wish an author with a bit of distance and vision would have done the actual writing of this book. As it is, Brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story. I hope this topic gets explored further by someone other than Brokaw, who has little talent as a writer. I was very disappointed reading this book and I made the mistake of buying gift copies for my elderly war vet friend & neighbors, and my own Father without pre-reading it. Live and learn, I guess. Sorry, I had expectations of being thrilled with this book...but wasn't."
3,From a fan of History,"This book provides a great deal of insight into the lives and character of those individuals that lived through the ww2 period. Except for the obligatory chapters, required by political correctness, of individuals that didn't do or contribute anything other than just live in that period, I feel that this is a very worthwhile book. As Brokow pointed out, the greatest insights come from comparing today's generation with those individuals from the greatest generation. And that forces all of us to comtemplate what the future will be like with our current generation in charge. We can only hope for the best."
3,Expectations Unmet,"I will be the first to admit that Tom Brokaw has a place in my heart and in that of most of America. Unfortunately however, his book does not. Though it offers a much deserved tribute to a great generation- and perhaps a much more important lesson to the youth of today- it was at many points a tedious and dull read.Conceptually it was interesting. Breaking it down into life synopsis' of those who were there was brilliant. However, they often read like a bad book report. ""Here are the facts of this peron's life. Done."" James Bradley's 'Flags of our Fathers' will leave you feeling much more obliged to the Greatest Generation."
2,A great disapointment,"Rather than letting his subjects tell their stories Brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy. I donated my copy to the city library. Instead, read Studs Terkel's ""The Good War."" It ""is"" what Brokaw could have ""had"", if he would have imitated the master oral biographer."
2,"As the kids in school say today ""Boring.""","The beginning and ending narrative touched my heart being from the great state of South Dakota and having walked many small cemeteries where veterans flags and tombstones mark the sites of our fallen. Other than that the stories were shallow and uninteresting, lacking depth and insight of the effect of the war on these individuals. Let's face it, post war prosperity brought these veterans the success they enjoy today. I don't think it had much to do with their military experiences. Joe Foss was not revered by South Dakotans to any extent and throwing Al Neuharth in was really clutching at straws.Really it was the parents of these WWII veterans that were the sacrificers, the moralists, the conservers, the workers, the survivors that should get the credit."
2,Individually - neat stories. Together - same stories,"My cryptic summary is trying to condense the fact that the individual stories are very interesting, put together they all start to run together into sameness. The indivudal accomplishments throughout the book as well as what this generation accomplished is undeniably fantastic. However, Brokaw's book ramrods this home with such volume that I simply couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to like this book, but I'll take Ambrose's D-Day book anyday."
3,It is ok,"This book is about the lives of World War II Veterans. I can see why so many people like it. This book does a very good job of giving details. The details make the book feel very personal. They allow you to really get to know the people that the stories are about. Unfortunately, it is the details that make the book seem boring. I would have liked it better if the details were focused on the action and not on trivial issues. Maybe, some day, when I am an old man (when I'm 26 or so), I will re-read this and get more enjoyment out of it. I did find several stories to be rather interesting. I enjoyed reading about the way African American veterans were treated. Another problem I had with the book is that Tom Brokaw is a little to conservative for me. Everybody, except the guy who makes the ""Mallard Fillmore"" comic strip, knows liberals are more fun. (..)"
4,The Greatest Generation,"""The Greatest Generation"" was inspiring. As a young adult I have yet to experience anything having to do with the war. The horror stories to me are exactly that, just stories. While reading this book I was taken aback. The generation today...Those kids at war now will return with many of the same experiences as those in World War II. It is unusual and sad to see the differences between ""The Greatest Generation"", and the generation today. The stories in this book are ones of hope, love, courage, bravery, and overcoming adversity. They are happy, sad, and inspiring. I enjoyed reading about those people that everyone has known or heard of, all the way to those people who go unheard and unspoken of. Tom Brokaw did a wonderful job capturing all aspects of World War II from the men in the middle of the battle, to the women fighting their own battles at home. Only time can tell how recent wars could potentially transform our generation into one similar to ""The Greatest."""
5,"Fascinating, eye-opening, heart wrenching","Reading this book makes me sad that my Dad is gone and I never asked him ""What did you do in the war, Daddy"". What an opportunity I missed!"
2,Does Tom know how to write?,"My father had this book on his shelf so I picked it up last Christmas break and polished it off in one afternoon, and it is obvious that Tom had very little to do with this book. IF you read the introduction, he essentially thanks everybody who found all the various stories for his book. The book is nothing more than a collection of compiled stories with Tom Brokaw's name on the book jacket. Hey Tom, write your own stories!"
4,Proudly add this to your library!,"Wonderful collection of stories about our WWII heros with nice commentary from the NBC newsman. Women and minorities are dutifully included, with the exception of the homosexual community. Tom's researchers could've dug a wee bit deeper. But all in all, it's a beautiful book with well-written, moving remembrances and photographs."
2,50% of this book is Tom reading from a high school history book,Half of this book is just Tom reading events from a high school history book. I expected the book to contain 90% letters but was disappointed half of the book contained this unwanted history review. It seems Tom is just trying to capitalize on the generation's tragedy. His reading of the factual events adds almost nothing to the understanding of the letters.
4,True heroism.,"This book has so much to offer. For the younger generation, it offers us a glimpse of something we've been told about, but can't truly grasp.World War II brought out the best in our nation. We came together under a common cause and were more united than ever. The young men and women of that generation, my age now and younger, were The Greatest Generation without a doubt.These amazing people have shared their stories with Mr. Brokaw, and it is just incredible to learn about the personal contributions that people made for the sake of our country.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater appreciation for the sacrifices of previous generations. This book will move you, and you will wholeheartedly have a new appreciation for these people."
2,Big disappointment,"This book is mainly about Brokaw's love for Republican politicians who served in World War Two, and little else. The average GI doesn't seem to matter here. There are some interesting parts, such as how black veterans were treated, but all in all, this book fails miserably."
5,A powerful tribute,"I am shocked that anyone could find this book ""tedious and condescending."" I must vehemently disagree with the reviewer who states that The Greatest Generation ""minimizes every other generation of people."" It does no such thing; it is a moving tribute to a generation that deserves such a tribute. If it weren't for the struggles and heroism of that generation, we might not be here today. The reviewer I refer to writes, ""if Mr. Brokaw and others think that my generation hasn't faced death, despair, fear, illness and poverty, he and they are not truly connected to the world in which they live now."" To this reviewer, I must say that the current generations of Baby Boomers and Gen X'ers do NOT face such struggle on the same massive level as those who lived (or died) during the Depression and the World Wars. Today's ""myriad of stresses that cloud everyday life"" cannot be compared to the stresses endured by what Brokaw rightly calls the ""Great Generation."""
3,It ain't Studs Terkel,"Noble try. Right instincts. There must surely be more interesting stories? Little energy, though the intention is touching. Book bogged down when laboring to touch all segments of society and be very politically correct. Did I really give this 3 stars?"
1,"Not the ""greatest"" in my book.","Sure, this generation won a war, but what was the alternative?In my opinion, all this generation did was run up the world's greatest debt...then leave it to their kids to pay the tab.When they didn't have a war to send their children to, they created one in Vietnam. After killing over 50,000 of us, they decided maybe it wasn't such a good idea afterall.When they decided they didn't want to pay for their own medical bills, they created Medicare. And guess who pays? They underfunded their retirement. And guess who pays? They built a highway system. And guess who pays? They poluted the environment like never before. Guess who pays to clean it up the mess.I do agree with Brokaw on one point, this is one generation that was the greatest at one thing...avoiding responsibility."
3,Whether You Love This or Hate It - Still Try the Sequel,"I read Brokaw's sequel: ""The Greatest Generation Speaks"" before reading this one, and that second book is far the better one. Those stories, submitted directly by readers in response to ""Greatest Generation"", are more compelling and inspiring than those of this original, since they rely on the contributors' own letters rather than Brokaw's ""interviews"". And ""Speaks"" successfully avoids the tedious repetition, political shading and denigration of the boomer generation that flaws this work. Read the sequel first, then tackle this one only if you must have more."
3,Not bad.....but I expected better,"Overall, I enjoyed this book, however, I felt that the greatest generation was given short shrift by Brokaw's concentration on war experiences. This is my parents' generation and it has always been apparent to me that their greatest strengths (and weaknesses) were forged in both the Depression and in World War II. Yet the significance could have been better shown in their many accomplishments (and failings)in shaping post-WWII America. Maybe an opportunity for a REAL sequel here (the follow-up book, Greatest Generation Speaks, is just a recycling of material not used in this book."
3,"Interesting, but repetative.","I appreciate Tom Brokaw's praise of his ""greatest generation,"" but after about 100 pages I began to feel as if I was reading the exact same story over and over again. I found there were only so many ways Mr. Brokaw could make his point, and after a while the concluding paragraphs of each story began to sound the same. I agree with other readers who said that as the book goes on, Brokaw begins to sound more and more like a little boy in awe running out of original ways to articulate his point. I will say, however, that I am still glad I read Brokaw's novel because, repetative or not, it paints an informative and warm, if biased, picture of a generation that certainly will be remembered forever."
1,Disappointing and shallow account of the ordinary heros WWII,"I was quite let down by the lack of real substance and information in the accounts. It is a great subject but the shallow treatment did not hold my interest. Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers is much, much better."
1,"Should have been a short story, too repetive","The story was good for the first three chapters, then it was the same story over and over with new names. Highly overrated."
2,"More like ""Irresponsible generation""","Yes, yes, they served, they were heroes, of course...they have done more than I could ever do.Somehow they forgot to instill in their children the same values.This is why we have a greedy, immoral, non-compassionate culture now.You don't get to claim ""Greatest"" without passing on something.They passed on the irresponsible yuppie elite, the short-sighted corporate executives, the Hollywood suits giving us crappy movie after crappy movie.These are the offspring of this so-called ""Greatest Generation.""To earn that title you have to ensure that the future will be better than what you had...but they didn't, they bred a horribly self-entitled litter of jerks.Tom, you are a great newsman, but you took the wrong side on this one...they may have been great people, but they were horrible parents who instilled terrible values in their kids."
5,The Next Great Generation,"Brokaw does a commendable job of describing how the ""Greatest Generation"" earned its name. For those who are interested in which generation is likely to be the next great one, I highly recommend a new book titled ""Millennials Rising"" by generational authors Neil Howe and Bill Strauss. They believe that in the cycle of generations, today's youngsters--the Millennials (born 1982 to the present)--will replace the G.I. generation as the next great generation. The Millennials are already reversing many of the negative social trends associated with the last generation of young adults, i.e. the Generation Xers."
1,"Preachy, dumbed-down stories with no spirit or innovation","I really looked forward to this book, based on my respect for Tom Brokaw and what I had heard. Unfortunately, he makes his point with a sledgehammer, telling sapppy stories with the same theme over and over, spoon feeding you the point, in case you somehow missed it. Grandma and Grandpa were great, generous, self-sacrificing gods and goddesses, and here are a thousand treacly repetitive stories why. This book condescends to the reader, unfortunately, probably with all good intentions but annoying results. I wasn't able to finish this book, and that's rare for me."
4,Only thing I agree with Brokaw about.,"With true stories about simple American heroes, The Greatest Generation is worthy of comparison to the best books about the men and women who fought and won WWII, The Winds of War, The Stephen Ambrose books, and The Triumph & the Glory come to mind, but perhaps the greatest praise for the greatest generation is THAT EVEN TOM BROKAW WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HONOR AND DECENCY WHEN HE SAW IT. There's hope for NBC News yet!"
1,Run - don't walk - away from your favourite bookstore ...,"This was not the greatest generation. This was the last bigoted generation. Bigotry today exists in smaller and smaller pockets, hangovers from the generation Brokaw prostrates himself to. My older friend tells me that she likes working with younger men than her own generation because she gets treated like an equal instead of a subordinate. Says it all really - the greatest generation doesn't even like itself. Is Tom Brokaw out to make a buck with the old `it were better in my time' malarkey, or is he stupid? Given that he is already very wealthy, and has never before struck me as an idiot, I'm going for the only other option - he wanted more limelight. By the way, the book was repetitive. If they were that great, why weren't there more examples to call on than the same schmaltz delivered time and again."
3,Disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. Needless to say the exploits of this generation were outstanding, but most did only what they should have done. I'm inclined to think that the generation that produced Tom's ""Greatest Generation"" was the greatest generation. I was also disappointed in some of his celebrity selections. His were good stories, but I believe there are better stories out there."
1,How can I write a book ? I to can ask my neighbors!,It is not worth buying ! If this a must read for you go to our public library. You just might thank me!
2,"Great at War, What About at Home?","Coming on the heels of the terrific movie ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Brokaw's book is sadly repetitive. One would think that World War II was the greatest thing Humanity was capable of. There were alot of interesting anecdotes, but not much of a point; what did the ""greatest generation"" go on to produce? Smug baby boomers. Unfortunately, that's there legacy."
3,Not a great book,Not a great book but very interesting to those who grew up during the 1930's and went off to war in WWII. Enjoyed reading it.
5,Factual but with an emotional touch.,Tom Brokaw provides a book which extends beyond dry facts and makes the events and lives come alive for the reader with the personal accounts of the people he interviewed. Highly memorable.
2,Interesting stories - dry writing,"You would have to be dead to not be touched by the stories in the book, but I found Mr. Brokaw's writing style a bit dry. The writing ended up sucking the life out of the stories."
3,"Worth reading, but not for the reason Brokaw wrote it","This book is well written and should be mandatory reading for Congress, the President, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff before they consider sending anyone off to war. Brokaw vividly describes how war (and WWII in particular) effects individuals. Those in combat as well as those who stay behind. Where this book falls short, however, is in Brokaw's theory that this was the Greatest Generation. This same book could have been written about the generation who fought the Civil War, WWI or any other war. Also, the individuals he writes about often disprove his own arguments. For example, several times during the early chapters Brokaw writes that this generation didn't believe in divorce. It just wasn't an option. Later in the book, however, he talks about one individual and ""his ex-wives."" This isn't the only contradiction in the book. Brokaw's attempt to make this book prove something more detracts from what would otherwise be an excellent book."
2,Mr.Brokaw concentrated too much on officers,"Mr. brokaw couldn't possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nation.Mr.Brokaw found mostly officers to interview,most of whom went into the service as officers,and later became politicians. Where are the uneducated,poverty stricken youths who went into the armed forces,fought and died for their country, and, those who survived,returned to their former lives little better off than before being drafted? The author never mentioned the fact that machinery is always in place to keep our rich youths out of the service,making their service in our armed forces strictly voluntary; and always as officers,most-repeat-,most of whom never heard a shot fired,the exception proving the rule"
2,Lacks style.,"While I know Brokaw is a newsman and journalist, too much of his linear style effects what are otherwise compelling stories of those who lived and fought for this country."
4,Interesting stories of American heroes during WW2,This book was an interesting colaboration of stories by Tom Brokaw. It takes place during World War 2 and touches on every subject for combat heroes overseas to heroes in America making supplies for those overseas. I really enjoyed this book even though some of the stories were a little slow and not action packed. Still they were writen with good insight to give you the feeling you actually know the person. There were many man and women who put their lives on the line for their country and they need to be remembered so that the youth of America will learn the lessons they are telling. Overall this was a good book with good explanations and descriptions even with the occasional story that I think should have been left out.
4,Character describes the people in Brokaw's book.,"If there is one word which comes to mind as I read Brokaw's book it was the word ""character."" What is lacking in our culture is character. It seems that character emerges from a culture which has experienced great hardship, deprivation, danger and the overcoming of great odds. Our generation (baby boomers) has had everything given to it. We expect it and feel that effort and challenge and hard work are unacceptable. As a result ours is a generation lacking ""character."""
3,Interesting,"Brokaw makes a good point, but it's delivered, in spots, rather tediously. There are better books out there about World War II, by professional historians, and by World War II participants (try BAT BOMB for a TOTALLY unique memoir of World War II. World War II buffs who don't know BAT BOMB, are like biblical scholars who don't know about Noah's Ark. And that is only a slight exaggeration.)"
2,DISAPPOINTED,I had high hopes for this very worthwhile topic. Reads like Mr. Brokaw is presenting a report on the late news. I expected a more developed presentation.
2,A poor mix of politics and first person history...,"First person history is one of the better ideas to come out of the historical community in decades. Instead of the ""Big Movers"" picture, this movement looks into the actual ""little people"" who make up the bulk of those involved in history giving one an idea of life in such times....However, this book does not live up to that ideal. Far from it, the short stories are just that, too short tales of hard times overcome and their participation in the War. Much is colored by Brokaw's political bias (glowing descriptions of his progressive heroes,a large percentage of those portrayed) and poor history (the old saw about FDR saving the nation rather then his actual fault at causing most of the Depression's problems...)There are likely better books out there on the subject, take the time and look as this will likely disappoint anyone truly wanting to learn about these times and the people involved"
2,Worth Reading - Barely,I am a veteran of WWII and was very disappointed in this book. It is totally devoid of emotion. Brokaw generates no real sympathy for his characters and the result is much like reading a dull history book filled with statistics. With the subject matter available he should have been able to bring many tears to the eyes of the reader. I suggest Brokaw read Flags of Our Fathers to discover what real writing is all about.
3,A flawed theory,"Brokaw's book has interesting information about individuals who came of age to fight in World War Two. But his premise that they are ""The Greatest Generation"" is wrong. If he had more knowledge of American History he would realize that EVERY generation, at least from the Revolution through World War Two, and, particularly, those that fought in the Civil War and in World War One, shared all of the characteristics that he attributes to the World War Two generation. This shouldn't detract from the stories he presents but a more accurate analysis would define how the generations that followed World War Two have changed from the preceding generations. That, it seems to me, is the point he is really trying to make."
2,Good intentions but dragged down by Brokaw's opinions,"""The Greatest Generation"" has an admirable goal, but falls short due to the author's heavy-handed attempts to hammer his point in.Tom Brokaw correctly recognizes the World War II era generation as one deserving of our gratitude and praise, and his approach to this subject is commendable. Brokaw provides portraits of the war's various participants ranging from minorities, women factory workers, the famous and the ordinary. However, Brokaw just can't let his subjects speak for themselves. He interrupts each narrative to make sure the reader understands why this is the greatest generation. If you are interested in a narrative history of World War II with no opinions clumsily inserted, I highly recommend Studs Terkel's ""The Good War."" Terkel demonstrates the incredible sacrifice and dedication of the WWII generation by picking a gamut of participants and lets their stories convince us that this was indeed a generation of heroes."
1,The most violent generation,"Here is a book that was hailed as a best seller before it was even released. One that was fed to the public by one of America's leading talking heads, Tom Brokaw. My grandfather was at Normandy and later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout Germany. What these experiences cost him, was ultimately his life. He rarely smiled after witnessing the horrific brutality, and inhumanity that was set loose on the world in WWII and after. This book is an attempt to rewrite, an already severely inaccurate history of this period of time. Brokaw tries to take the attention from the mass slaughter that was perpetrated by BOTH sides, and instead focus on the heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories so common to todays evening news. Living through the ""greatest generation"", killed my grandfather's spirit, along with millions of others like him, who instead saw in it a living hell, and a disgrace to humanity."
1,Am I missing something?,What is so special about this book? I am a baby boomer that has always respected the sacrifices that the WWII generation had to endure both oversees and at home. Do I need Tom Brokaw to reinforce this? Please! I stopped about half way through; to me it was 200 pages of senior citizen complaints about the younger generations.
4,Good Book,"I purchased this CD for a college assignment on the war generation. I picked a perfect book. Tom Brokaw truly captures an entire generation with detailed accounts of their heroic challenges they faced. I believe that the only downfall to this book is Tom Brokaw's voice. As nice as it sound on TV doing the news, it seems to be a bit monotone. It started to drive me nuts several times while listening. I guess that's why I chose to purchase the book on CD so I could just stop it at any time and then pick it back up an hour or two later. Overall, it is well worth the money."
1,"Interesting content, poor writting and editing",The stories of the people depicted in the book are interesting. Ranging from really interesting to somewhat interesting. These were people that made a difference and deserve our respect. However the book is poorly put together. It seems as if I am watching a TV show on paper. A poor end result. Would not recommend.
4,Maybe not the greatest generation ever.,I agree with Mr. Brokaw on many points and he is correct in saying that this generation brought about change This generation passed innovative legislation. I don't agree that it's the greatest generation perhaps compared to recent generations; lest we forget the generation that fought the war of Independence or the Civil War. If we forget history we are doomed.
1,"Self promoting and falsely exaggerated American ""morals""","Tom Brokaw knows better than his ""admiring"" comments about U.S veterans. he is giving too much credit to American WWII veterans. Other than raising his ""good old american image"", I see no point in praising a nation that only profitted from WWII. Brokaw should spend his time on other journalistic adventures, and stop being a hedonist."
1,"Stick to the news, Tom.........","It amazes me that this book remained atop the best seller list for so long. There was absolutely nothing in this book which has not been covered, in a far more descriptive style, by a host of authors. This book did not have another authors help, and by god it needed it!"
2,The Greatest Generation,"Although the subject matter is excellent, as are the stories, the editing is very poor. Editing in such a way as the tape ends in the middle of a story is uncalled for in this day and age.Brokaw needs to understand words beginning with an x are sounded as if starting with a z. Thus, Xavier University is pronounced as ""Zavier"" and not ""Exavier."" For a professional, this is simply unacceptable."
2,His bias review of WWII,"I cannot say that I have ever exprenced war. Yet what we as a younger generation have faced is very clearly a far cry from peace. This terrorisom against us as a country makes us just as good as those that contributed to the war efforts of WWII. I am taken aback as Brokaw decided that in his godly manor that his father, and his fathers friends were the numro uno. Every generation has its fair share of heros it is horrible to pinpoint one generation to this and cover up what really needed to be said, that we lost thousands of men and women to a cause that needed to be fought. But recent events change the outlook of WWII, September 11 has shown the world that we as a country not a generation are the greatest, WE as a country not singled out retired folks who did do a great job, but in the book it failed to show the real deal it glossed over too much."
2,Copy was highlighted,The copy recieved was not as described. I was expecting a clean used copy and I recieved a copy that was used as a text book and had yellow & green highlighter and hand written notes in the margins. I could not give it as a gift.
3,"Yes this is a history book, but then again...","As a future historian I am amazed in how journalists can write a book on a historical topic and think they are giving an accurate historical portrayal. When I bought The Greatest Generation I was looking forward to reading some priceless primary material. I was very disappointed. The men and women who lived through WWII do have unique qualities that are not seen in other generations, but does that mean they are the greatest? I think not. They made mistakes like every other generation. There was divorce, spousal abuse, fatherless children, STD's, double standards. I respect the men and women who fought this war on the home front and the war front a great deal, but are they truly the greatest? No generation was truly great, many were just very unique. As Americans we should honor that uniqueness, but we should not forget that each generation has made their share of mistakes."
1,Presumably not the Greatest Generation of Parents,It's very ironic that the supposed greatest generation were not able to instill their sterling qualities in their own children - the much maligned baby boomers. This failure seems to expose a serious deficiency of parenting and mentoring skills.
2,A talking head doesn't equal a writing head.,"Big disappointment. I saw Brokaw on the talk shows and had high hopes for The Greatest Generation. But the author's dry, uninspired writing style made reading more chore than pleasure. I soon found myself skimming. I can recall only a few of the chapters. As a more readable subsitute, I recommend the similar book by Studs Turkel called, I think, The Good War. It was told in the words of the subjects themselves."
2,The Greatest Generation did not get the Greatest Author,"The Greatest Generation they might well have been. The stories are compelling and diverse, However, Mr Brokaw's writing style is an abomination, His prose is dry. He does not trust the reader to be able to draw the significance or irony of the events descibed, rather he is compelled to tell the reader: ""This is significant. This is ironic."" He holds the readers hand rather than setting them free to think about the lives and to appreciate their beauty. I think only bright pink highlighting of the sentences would have been more annoying. All and all, a great topic, great lives but an overbearing and boring presentation. Apparently, Mr. Brokaw is not content to be a reporter but feels it is necessary to be remedial reading instructor as well"
2,Brokaw is better on television.,"The Greatest Generation is pretty good, considering. I mean what can one really expect by way of literature from over paid, telegenic, media stars? I enjoyed the references to Howard Stern. Too bad Brokaw didn't give Stern his own chapter. The book reminded me of Getting To Howard: The Odyssey of an Obsessed Howard Stern Fan. Now that's a great book. Sort of like Tolstoy meets Dr. Seuss."
3,"Superficial, repetitive tales. No depth and finally tedious","It is not to take anything away from the incredible deeds of the WWII generation to say that had this book been written by anyone other than Brokaw it would not have been so welcomed. The stories really are repetitive - the triumph of goodness, perseverance etc. The format of the book is real pop culture. Surely, these people deserve something better thought out than a group of short stories."
3,Good concept. Slow reading.,"I found the idea of the book very interesting. Some of the chapters were very well written. For the most part however, it put me to sleep quite often. It wasn't the book I thought it would be. I loaned the book to my father who was in World War 2 in the South Pacific. I'm anxiously awaiting his review of the book."
2,the writing of an amateur. Poor copy of Stephen Ambrose sty,"One short story follows another. The names change , the style (or lack of it), message and conclusions are all about the same. I cannot imagine how the author selected the subjects. A poor attempt to imitate the style and brilliance of Stephen Ambrose."
4,This book was thought-provoking and informative.,"I read this book and finally began to understand all the things that my dad would never talk about concerning the war. The stories are well written and thought provoking. The very fact that these people came home and did their best to be good citizens and make good lives without complaining speaks volumes about that generation. Now we saw soldiers crying about having to leave their families during Desert Storm. Do we think it was any easier for the generation during WWII? This book shows us how ""me centered"" we are. Another thing, now soldiers came back from the Viet Nam or Desert Storm wars and blame everything on their military experience. The WWII generation sucked it up and went on with their lives. They got over it. Makes me sort of ashamed of the way my generation deals with life experiences."
2,Reads like a 10 hour Nightly Newscast,"Tom Brokaw (and a squadron of 'helpers') produced a bombastic, windy book that is a disservice to the superb stories that he is trying to tell.The book is at its best when Brokaw lets the individuals tell their own stories, with a minimum of his commentary intruding. The peoples' stories are poignant, vivid, and worth reading.The problem is, you have to wade through Brokaw's creaking prose to get to the good stuff. Hackneyed phrases loaded with superfluous adjectives may sound OK when read in Tom's distinctive voice - but they do not read well.So - kudos to Tom on getting people to tell the stories. Rotten job of trying to package them."
4,Insightful stories of an important era in our history,"would be one way to describe Tom Browkaw's collection of stories about the lives of a generation that have been underappreciated. Another way to characterize his book, however, would be to say that after reading it, we should all have a better understanding of why Memorial Day is a holiday. The lives that Brokaw chronicles for us are a microcosm of a generation that shaped the world in the 20th century. As someone who had a very limited understanding of WWII, I now feel that I have more knowledge of the sacrifices countless men and women made. The book was especially useful for giving parents some diverse examples human responses to adversity. Browkaw did an excellent job at making the spector of war become more personal for us all."
2,"Trite; just capitalizing on ""Saving Private Ryan""","For gripping stories of WWII, read ""D-Day,"" by Stephen Ambrose. These ""up close and personal"" stories grew monotonous. Most significantly, Brokaw gave short shrift to the sins of this ""greatest"" of generations. While I appreciated the discussion of our nation's treatment of Japanese-Americans during the war, full treatment of this generation's rampant racism, sexism and post-WWII national arrogance was missing."
1,A worthwhile topic but lacking focus and proportion.,"Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book."
3,"Creative, yet....","Just because this guy's been giving us the news for years, decades, does not mean he knows this century. Creative idea, sure, but it's a great way to cash in on the millenium, eh?"
3,Very good until Brokaw decided to add political correctness,"There was much to bring back memories but then after saying this was America's greatest generation he had to ruin it by adding political correctness. He decided he had to write about America's sins on women, blacks, Japanese, etc. This took away from his original title and I began to wonder if he named the book ""The Greatest Generation"" only to sell books."
1,America's disturbing ignorance,"I am quite disturbed by the absolute ignorance of the american reviewers of this book. They honestly believe America was solely responsible for the allies winning of the war. This book is extremely complacent, and with its remarkable bias, does not qualify as history. As the last reviewer said, American's obviously think they are better than everybody else. That was the reason why Germany started the war in the first place."
3,Fantastic Book but .....,"This book was great, except when Tom used many pages to emphasize the womans role in ww2. Frankly, I could care less about the women of ww2. Besides the woman crap, I would suggest that everyone should read this book, to understand what these brave soldiers did for their country during the war and after the war."
2,"An Insult to All, Including Brokaw's Generation","Thank You Brokaw's generation for winning the war that should have been won (though without the A-bomb), and then sending us into Korea, and Vietnam, and Iraq, and Iraq again (and still) and Afghanistan (not a war of necessity, please read more than the mainstream media) just to name a few. You insult us all, even you own generation."
2,A poor tribute.,"I had hoped for a well-written and well-researched book about my parents' generation, and was disappointed that this book is neither. It appears to have been written by committee, as if a classroom of young journalism students (hmmm) were asked to write a 3-5 page essay about their parents' or grandparents' trials and tribulations in the Great Depression or in WWII. Were these stories then roughly stitched together by someones staff (hmmm) and sent on to a willing publisher who felt the name & face recognition of a network anchorman would sell almost anything (hmmm)......, voila, you would have a book! But it wouldn't be a very good book."
3,"Worth reading, but it's no masterpiece","This book has it's high and low points. Some of the story's can be very sad, some are dull. Overall, it did give me a much better appreciation of my grandparent's generation. They're gone now, but I feel like I understand a little better what they went through with the Great Depression and WWII.It reads fast, and is easy to put down and come back to later. Thus, a good book for the beach when you're watching the kids. Some people debate whether calling them the ""Greatest Generation"" is fair, one of them is Andy Rooney - I think his chapter in Brokaw's book is one of the best.It's also neat to see the ""than and now"" photos of the subjects."
4,How about the Generation before?,"The book is favorably received by the children of the subject generation. Perhaps more should be told of the elderly mothers and fathers of WWII generation who made physically demanding sacrifices. Despite losing close family members, they took in married daughters and their children, rented rooms to soldiers (and their wives), worked long beyond middle age, and graciously gave up comforts due them to encourage and make the chaotic existence tolerable for the rest of us."
1,"Good idea, poor execution",Tom Brokaw is not a gifted writer. He wrote this book in the same dry and simple style as he uses with his TV audience. The book is completely stripped of romance and soul for the sake of the lowest common denominator. I have met many WW2 veterans who tell stories woven with romance and heartbreak that bring tears to your eyes. This is not represented in any of the 4 page biographies of these common place heroes. Pure non-fiction at its most uninspiring.
3,Interesting (but not as good as I had hoped).,"When I first began reading this book, I couldn't put it down. However, the further I got into the book the chapters became less detailed and less well written. It seemed as though the author hurried through the last half of the book. Also in the latter chapters of the book, very little information is provided on the wartime experiences and much more is given on the postwar experiences. Although I would still recommend this book, the author would've had to provide more detail to convince me that this was the ""Greatest Generation."""
2,Brokaw's not so in-depth look at WWII generation,"Being a WWII buff, when I heard about this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. However, shortly after reading the first few stories, I was deeply disappointed. I have utterly lost all respect for Mr. Brocaw's journalistic ability. The book is simplistic (written at about an 8th grade level), repetitive and boring. It feels more like an article from People Magazine than any sort of historical record or work of literature. Devoid of facts and details, it contains very little of anything else.The generation he is writing about deserves a better tribute than this. I suppose it is to be expected that a member of the info-tainment industry would write something with such little substance. I used to be a loyal viewer of NBC News, I think I'll switch that loyalty to Jim Lehrer and PBS."
5,Excellent capturing of my parents' generation..,"Tom Brokaw does an excellent job of interviewing and capturing the impact of WWII on the lives of these heroes and heroines. The war experience was the common bond that elevated this generation to strive for greatness not only for their own lives but for the entire nation. Brokaw, drawing from his vast experience and skills as a newscaster, is able to extract stories of great bravery and self responsibility from each of the individuals interviewed. He brings out the sense of loyalty, duty, honor, respect and self worth, not found in today's generation."
3,needed to have more depth,Very easy book to read but the author needed to have longer chapters about indivduals and should have profiled fewer people. I came away with the feeling that only veterans from south dakota made a difference in the war. As a vietnam vet I was interested in the few comparisons that the author made between ww11 and the vietnam conflict. I feel that the author was trying to get present generations to be more thankful to the ww11 vet and he makes his case that we indeed should do that. I will try to seek out the ww11 vet in my hometown and simply say thank you and hopefully 30 years from now tom brokaw will write a book about the vietnam war and generation z will seek me out and say thank you.
2,Our parents are special...duh,"While most people described in this book are certainly interesting, many are regular people (like me) with fine achievements but with no particular attractiveness to warrant inclusion in a ""greatest"" list. I keep waiting to see what many of these ""greatest"" people did,,,and wonder why my parents, of the same generation and with a better story (at least in my opinion), weren't included! Short, basic bios. Its a fair night stand book...for those who fall asleep easily."
2,You missed the point Tom,"This book does an admirable job of describing the great accomplishments of the WW2 generation. Many people with little preparation became heroes or millionaires. But to call them the 'Greatest Generation' totally misses the point on what it takes to make one great. It isn't just great accomplishments, it's having great values - and passing these on to your children so that when you're gone the world is a better place. Look at the children neglected while their mothers work. Look at the skyrocketing national debt. Look at the social security debacle. The 'Greatest Generation' passed all these on to us to solve.Look around Tom... they were a major failure."
1,Don't bother,"Sentimental, shallow book about WWII vets. I agree with his assessment of the generation, however. Read Stephen Ambrose if you want good WWII books. This book is only selling because the author is a celebrity. Duh."
1,The Greatest Generation Deserved Better,Shame on Tom Brokaw for giving an epic title to a book that is clumsily written and tedious to read. I am totally underwhelmed by the lack of substance in this book.
4,Inspiring,"I am tremendously inspired by the stories contained in this book. The American spirit during WWII is unequalled especially compared to the sick societies of Japan and Germany. Whether this generation is the ""greatest"" or not, there is no doubt in my mind that the cooperative effort that was required to defend freedom and defeat the fascists is without a doubt the greatest effort in history."
5,Greatest Generation is the Greatest Book,Tom Brokaw did a wonderful job with this book. You can really feel what all those people went through and all of the sacrifices they had to make. My faverite chapter in the book was the one about Thomas and Eileen Broderick. Thomas was a paratrooper in World War Two. He jumped into a shootout one time and a bullet hit him right in the head. He later found out that he would be blind for the rest of his life. This is just one of the many tragic and touching stories in this wonderful book. I recomend you go out and buy this book right away.
5,Now you can FEEL the Time,"This book was nothing what I expected. I can now understand where some of the great people of today came from. Tom writes as if he were in awe of these people. I know I was after I read the book. This book covers the time before and during WWII. You can see the people he writes about selling newspapers, building planes, women flying the planes. This is a really feel good book. You will come away feeling great about your relatives who lived during this time. This book answered many ""Why"" questions. If you have been lucky enough to live in a close family, this will give you the reason so many familys are close, and what true family values are all about. You have heard many politicians speak of this, but this book has the answer. I didn't put it down until it was finished. I don't like Tom, but I respect his writing ability and the way he presented this book."
2,Reads like a high school English project,"""The Greatest Generation"" reminds me of biographies printed for class reunions or interviews published in a small town newspaper. In ""The Greatest Generation"" Tom Brokaw profiles dozens of people who served their country during World War II.Most of the profiles follow the template of: X did this during the war, X had this memory of the war, X married Y and they had these children, the war changed X in this manner, this is how X's family think the war influenced X, this is why X's friend or co-worker thinks X is a great person, and this is what X thinks of the generations to follow.Using this formula made it easy for Brokaw to do three to ten page bios on the people he met. The profiles all seem generic after awhile. The book packs very little emotional impact perhaps because it is written in an overly sentimental manner. There are very few interesting stories or anecdotes for a book that goes over 400 pages.I expected something better from Tom Brokaw."
3,Stories with common themes,"I noticed common themes in the stories that Brokaw wrote about in this book. These people were very patriotic. Most of these people grew up during The Depression. They appreciated family and survival. They worked hard and made something of themselves after the war. They endured discrimination and yet they were not bitter as a result. They did not want to talk about the war and if they were recognized as heros, they were humble and accepted their awards as a symbol of all those that fought beside them. This was a truly amazing generation. I believe the circumstances of the time influenced them to become what they were. They paved the way for the next generation to come . They didn't understand the younger generations and felt slightly removed but I don't think that made them any different then the generation that preceded them. I am glad I had the opportunity to read this book. Especially since a lot of them gone to their great reward. God Bless them."
4,Surprised,"I read the book and I've read some of the reviews. The book is an easy read. It is not a literary breakthrough, but a good story about a sometimes forgotten generation. The accusations by reader/reviewers of racism, bias, poor research, poor enunciation are surprising. It is too bad we cannot read and enjoy a book for what it is: A tribute to some of those who fought and preserved our freedom. I didn't expect to read a factual history, detailed analysis, of the period and I am surprised that others did. I enjoyed the stories, the point of view and even the parts that I found too wordy and somewhat boring. But, I guess I'm too tolerant."
4,A thoughtful portrait,"When I began this book, I knew it was about my parents' generation. I did not understand that it covered so thoroughly their sacrifices in and around World War II. Throughout the book, I thought about my uncle, who was in Europe and Japan during the war. I gained a greater understanding of the way members of my family, my friends' parents and people in the public eye behaved. Tom Brokaw presents a compelling picture of the values and fortitude that contribute positively to the fabric of our society. Without pointing out the differences, he demonstrates very well what we have lost in our generation. His words are minimal and important. He does not write one word that does not need to be included. The stories are spare; he draws us into the lives of the people he presents. I finished the book reluctantly, glad I read it, filled with a new understanding and wanting more. Thank goodness there is a sequel!"
3,Falls short of its promise,"I think the premise of this book is great. The generation that survived the depression and fought in WWII was the pivotal generation in American history. They saved the world from tyranny, helped bring about the civil rights movement, built the interstate highway system, built a modern education system, and did it with quiet dignity and grace. They did bring us their whiny offspring the baby boomers (who think they are the greatest generation for introducing drugs and free love) but no one is perfect.While the stories and vignettes were interesting, I wanted more. Brokaw never goes in depth to explore the true magnitude of what these people accomplished. This is a good starter book, or appetizer. For the main course, I would recommend one of Stephen Ambrose' excellent works on WWII."
2,A long thank you,"This book is in a real sense a long and general thank you letter to a generation. While the flavor of appreciation comes across as very real in this book I was hoping for a more acedemic and researched direction. I was dissapointed. The generation of the 40's deserves this book for the gratitude that it heaps on them, though I don't agree they are quite the saints as they are protrayed. Not much substance...Please some historian/writer follow the idea and write a proper book!"
1,Garbage,Which is worse his ego or his partisan views? This guy has an agenda and it's almost as dumbed down as his representation of the news. One more example of the whole show going in the toilet.
1,"Really, all this just to sell books","Listen, I like Tom Brokaw as a journalist, but this book was such an obvious pander in order to sell books. It worked, he sold a lot of copies. By calling the WWII generation the ""Greatest Generation"", it gives anyone born within the general area the idea that they are great. Brokaw doesn't bother to make a distinction between the ""GI Generation"", or the people who actually marched off the war, fought a war, came home, built a middle class and thrived. And those of the ""Silent Generation"" who came a long a little later and were big on conformity in the 1950's, didn't suffer in the war or the Great Depression. I don't think just because you're old, you're great, and the author simply would not make the distinction in order to sell copies."
2,"Good idea, but shallow text and a distorted picture","Brokaw writes not like a veteran newsman, but like an awestruck, hero-worshipping kid. That's not a crime, but one expects more from a man with Brokaw's experience and training. I felt the text was very shallow -- especially in the final section when he interviews celebrities. One doesn't learn a lot in this section. Nor does one get any meaningful insights. I also felt there was a tremendous ""sameness"" about the interviews. Surely, there were people who had bitter memories or less than passionately patriotic views. Brokaw could have presented a more accurate picture of the generation by including a dissenting opinion or two. Regrettably, one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on NBC News."
2,A book of simple hurra patriotism,"I used to enjoy Tom Brokaw when he was NBC anchor man as a critical and competent journalist. His book however is a real disappiontment. For me, belonging to the post-war generation, it reads as a very shallow ""hurra-patriotism"" story, without any ctitical investigation of the time priode he covers. Not everything this generation did was so great and I would have expected from a critical journalist like Tom Brokaw to take this aspect into consideration as well. In this sense it is not very demanding book."
2,surprising inaccuracies,"An interesting concept containing a series of stumbling blocks that impede the reader's progress down the Brokaw path. Examples: In dealing with both the Womens Army Corps (WAC) and the United States Army Air Corps, Brokaw consistently mis-names the units. The Army Air Corps was NOT the Army Air Force. The WAC began with the WAAC - Womens Army Auxillary Corps- which converted (with the necessity of WAAC members being sworn into the Army), and became the Womens Army Corps. Brokaw consistently and incorrectly refers to it as the WACs -both in the text and in the index on page 412 of the book. I also wondered how the editor had managed to ignore the structure of a sentence on page 190... ""Lieutenent Settle spent the rest of the war supervising medical technicians at the hospital with no difficulties."" My flow of reading was too often impeded by technical error."
3,"Eh, It's OK","Not a lot here, but really, how hard would it have been to compile some couple-page biographies of heroes who served in WW2?"
1,Redundant and repetitious.,"""Tom...don't quit your day job.""The Greatest Generation is both cliche-ridden and self-servng.This book is merely a platform for Mr. Brokaw's ultra-left leanings.Tom never tells us what some of these heroes think of our present ""commander in chief."""
4,Today's generation gets to realize just how easy life is!,"Tom Brokaw tells us in his words, and in the words of others, just how heroic the people who grew up with nothing and fought for their country are. The book is not a literary masterpiece, just a compilation of compelling stories about real people and real struggle....a struggle that always results in a sense of pride and responsibility that just doesn't seem to exist today. Some of the book is more interesting than others; Brokaw seems to want to be as politically correct as possible, covering every possible race, creed, and gender.It does, in the final analysis, give the reader insight into the true battles of the 1940's and insight into the spoiled nature of those growing up in the late 20th century."
