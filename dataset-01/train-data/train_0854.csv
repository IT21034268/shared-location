2,Was Ravenwolf busy the day they wanted this?,"This is an icky little thing. It is exactly what it claims to be, but does the casting of such charms do anything to bring you closer to the divine?No.Stick to prayer and meditation. A relationship with the Divine, be it the Lord and Lady, The Mother Goddess, or oneself, is the real wasy to be spiritually well."
4,Love this album,"This one hit the nail right on the head for me. I enjoyed the melodies, the instrumentation, the NOLA sound that isn't typical. And don't forget the lyrics. This is, so far, my favorite of the Subdudes albums. Particularly good to me were ""Why Can't I Forget About You"", ""I Know"", ""Miss Love"",""Sugar Pie"", ""Save Me"", ""It's So Hard""."
4,new orleans,"Another of the fine recordings from the New Orleans group with an original sound. No drummer, but lots of beat."
4,good value,"I have two of these, and have used them with portable equipment for solo vocal, solo instrument, choir and organ recordings. This mic has good frequency and directional characteristics for the price. When placed a little too far away from a solo instrument, the outcome is a little thin but easily compensated on the mixing board or in post-processing. It's pretty solidly built, mine have been dropped a few times and they seem fine. Not sure I could have found anything better for the same price. The option to run with battery is a nice convenience."
4,Famous T-rex,"This was a hilarious retelling of The existance and discovery of the dinosaur known as T-Rex. It contains interviews from an actress in the original Jurrasic Park, movie producers of the claymation,black & white dinosaur movies and even King Kong! Untold millions of fans love T-Rex, so I don't know why they decided to turn him into Liberace at the end. Guys, seriously? You really want us to believe that a full grown T-Rex had feathers don't you? It looks completely rediculous. You almost sold me on the babies having some kind of downy coating but feathers? You do know how hot it was back then? If you're gonna make him look stupid just give him a clown suit. There's a fine line between funny and stupid...and you crossed it at the end. The rest of the dvd was very enjoyable and suitable for children. Just pay no attention to the fairy dinosaur behind the curtain at the end!"
1,Misrepresented Time and Content,When I bought this dvd I thought it was a complete concert.Instead the whole dvd was only 52 min I have the concerto on cdsince 1998 when I Played this dvd they made cuts in the 1st movement and some of the drum solo in the 3rd movement There were NO CUTS in my cd. So this dvd is NOT 175 min as it says wait and hopefully there will be a reissue of the COMPLETE Concerto with no cuts and whatever there was with it. also I checked out thenewer cd version looked at some reviews and yep! there were cuts on that version will continue to listen to MY copy of the cd which is now out of print.
4,"On DVD, at last","I was starting my radio broadcasting career back in 1969. I was still a teenager at the time and was not a classical music fan, yet! When I first heard the Concerto on vinyl for the first time, I knew I had to have it and I eventually bought the CD when it became available. When Deep Purple came out with the 1999 Concerto at the Royal Albert Hall, I was very excited. What a concert! Steve Morse does a remarquable job. And then, the big surprise. The original concert on DVD!!! Goodness, can this be? Yes it's true and it's good. The sound is awsome considering the whole thing was recorded back in 1969. I give it 4 stars out of 5 because of the camera shots. The switcher was not familiar with the music because when Ritchie plays solo, the camera stays too long on somebody else.Still a must have."
5,DEEP PURPLE DVD,"I,ve had this concert on vynil for years and I,ve always wanted it on film and I was not disapointed it is brilliant."
1,VERY CONFUSING!,"This is by far the worst language instruction book I have ever used. The format is very confusing. For whatever reason, you are instructed to read the end of the chapter first before attempting to follow the dialogues and exercises at the beginning of the Unit. By the middle of the first chapter, full articles are written in Spanish without any translation. I was completely lost. While many of the students loved our Spanish instructor, they dropped the class because of this textbook."
1,This book was very unhelpful.,"I am a student of Spanish. This textbook contains a number of errors, jumbled phrases. The glossary is terrible. I have to recommend going with another textbook if you are thinking about teaching Spanish or learning Spanish."
4,Dimelo tu!,"The book was very well priced and came promptly. It had a lot more markings than what was expressed. It made me wonder how well it was looked at before set to sell. However, it was still a great value. Thanks for the great service."
1,DOES NOT COME WITH ACCESS CARD,"Initially I bought a used version of this book on Amazon, but soon after I did I realized it would not come with a valid access code, so I canceled the order. This was 3 days ago and Amazon has still not refunded my account yet. I then bought the new version assuming it had an online access code, since it does not state that it does NOT come with an access code, and no reviews claimed this either. I need the code for my class and it is the only reason I purchased this item from Amazon in the first place. Complete waste of money and time."
5,Frans review,I loved this movie. I will enjoy watching again and again.Thanks for providing this service.
3,Tear Jerker,Pretty good movie. Tells the story of a mother that would give everything for her family.
3,"""Very Touching""",Weepy fact-based story about a woman facing her impending death and forced to let her baby's nurse become an integral part of her family's life to aid the future care of the child and her husband.The movie is definitely worth seeing.You guys won't be disappointed.
5,TOUCHING STORY,"This is a lovely story of a mother who has recently given birth to a premature baby. The mother then discovers that she has terminal cancer. The nurse assigned to care for the baby in hospital befriends the family.Following the mother's death, her husband and the nurse start a relationship together.This is a beautiful movie. The acting is believable and the story-line is handled sensitively."
5,Very good movie,"I had taped this movie, which was called God's New Plan, from a t.v. showing many years ago. Always went back and pulled that old VHS tape and looked at it because of the real pleasure it gave me. Decided to look on Amazon and there it was with a different name but obviously the same movie. Though Katie Sagal did a wonderful job in it I couldn't quite believe how he was supposed to have fallen so in love with her at first meeting as she isn't really a pretty woman. But, through her performance she was able to convince me that it had happened the way she said. Come to think of it, he is no Adonis is he. It's a wonderful story of the triumph of love over death. No horrible mean characters, no bratty, talk back kids, no ulterior motives. It's the type of movie you can look at over and over again and always enjoy it. I thought this was an unusually good use of actors known only from t.v. shows. All of them did an excellent job."
3,a little goes a long way,"I am a big Mills Brothers fan and thought I just couldn't live without this 5-disc set of their earliest recordings. Frankly, I've become bored. The producer decided every recording, in chronological order, even those recorded twice, three times, even four, should all be included. I've struggled to listen all the way through, and am still working at it; after all, I paid $60 bucks for this set. At the same time I purchased THE ANTHOLOGY (1931 to 1968) which is nothing short of delightful. That's the one I recommend!"
5,Nostalic Mills Brothers,This was a gift for my 93 year old Uncle and he LOVED listening to every song. We were pleased to be able to find this item at such a good price..
5,"For the ""Grand Dame"" of Film, the long trek was over.","The film is a tribute to the wisdom and the forgiving nature of an aging mother(Jessica Tandy)who has been kept apart, by choice, from the embrace of the man she has loved by her unwillingness to challenge the selfishness of her coddled son and only child.Her lover was portrayed by her off screen husband(Cronin)whose closing dialog was rendered bitersweet by the subsequent passing of the persona of Miss Daisy snd Ninny Threadgood.An adeptation of a story written by a Canadian author takes the viewer on the delightful voyage of higher learning of two unlikely traveling companions. (Bridget Fonda)accompanies ""Camilla"" on a trip that begins in a grove of moss covered vines on a sprawling Georgia Plantation and returns her heart to a small flat near Niagra Falls.The plot twists and turns through art imitating life situations that are familiar and amusing. If you are a Jessica Tandy fan it's a must see, if only to bid her a fond farewell and."
1,Just say no,"If you think it's going to be thelma and louise all over again, FORGET IT. This movie is slow, pointless and just NOT funny. Save your money, really."
3,"pretty good, but not good enough","I have a gun that ramps to 30 bps. The box for the hopper says 19 bps, but it constantly feeds only 14 - 15 bps. It's a great hopper for tournaments when you cap at 15 bps, but if you just want to play on your own, it's not that great. For the price it is a great hopper, so i would still recommend it."
3,A little too subtle...,"This story of a black rabbit and a white rabbit who fall in love is intended to give young readers a message about different races living in harmony, but it is so subtle; I'm afraid its intended audience will completely miss the point. And without that point, there isn't much of a story left. The book is beautifully illustrated, but adults looking for a ""message book"" will find better choices without looking terribly hard."
3,"SWEET, BUT BORING","THIS REALLY IS A SWEET STORY, BUT THE PICTURES ALMOST ALL SEEM THE SAME. WOULD BE A GOOD BEDTIME STORY, BUT NOT SOMETHING I'D WANT TO READ MORE THAN TWICE."
3,"Quality, Quality!","Love the detail and the sound of freshness when the seal comes down. Even works well for my brown sugar.Amazon is the best place I have found to buy these canisters, I just wish you could get the large one. I now have five and two sets of the salt and pepper shakers, for cinnamon and powdered sugar. Please try to get the large canister if you can."
1,"Very Disappointed, but don't let it sway you","I bought this album in hopes of recapturing the feeling I got from listening to Boneshakers Volume II with DJ BMF. It almost doesn't even sound like the same guy. I don't know what happened to him and why he was change from the instrumental hip-hop that I considered he had a mastery of in that album, but if you liked that album, this one is sure to disappoint. Full of relatively pointless and uninteresting tracks. But, if you somehow came across this album, please don't let it sway you from paying the money for Boneshakers Volume II. That's worth whatever it cost, in my humble opinion. Its old school (1996), but an interesting listen."
1,Not worth the money,"This microwave splatter screen was not at all what I expected. The circle of tiny ""weights"" that was meant to hold this mesh screen in place had no weight to it at all. Thus, I found this product rather useless for covering bowls, etc., in the microwave, because it kept slipping around. I ended up throwing it away, because it wasn't worth the cost of return shipping. The only positive thing I can say is that it was received in a timely manner."
4,Microwave splatter screen,"At first I thought this was a gimmick, but I've found that I like it, and use it almost every day. It's really better than using plastic wrap, and cheaper. Green. I'm glad I bought it."
3,"Good for bowl or cup, not plate",What I like best of the product is that steam easily escape and doesn't accumulate or drip as other plastic covers do. The screen is good for heating food in a bowl or a cup. I don't use it on a plate because it'll touch the food. Hope those red dots can be heavier to hold the screen even.
5,Get it if you want to keep Microwave clean!,The other positive reviews have summed up what is good about this little screen. I am just adding my vote of confidence. This things works well and is keeping the microwave interior clean.
5,microwave spatter screen,This is the second order of this item. I'm very pleased with it. I recommend it. Delivery was prompt.
3,Ok,"I have seen great feedbacks from people and bought this one.. I haven't had great experience of using the product since we have alternative piece and no one at my home like to use this product..I would use if the diameter of the product is doubled so that we can cover containters easily i.e, the way it shown in picture"
1,splatter screen hanky??,This is cheap netting that comes in a little box the size of a deck of playing card. Picture and narrative (screen) sounds like what it does not what it is. It's netting alright. Shouldn't complain too much I just threw it away and went to bed and beyond and bought a solid plastic cover that works great
1,Not worth it.,This was a flimsy sheet to cover food cooking in a microwave. Why not use a paper towel which would be cheaper?
5,fabulous!,"i purchased this splatter guard a few years ago at my local supermarket. since then, i've been looking for one for my daughter. years later, i still couldn't find it. amazon saved the day. i purchased 2 of them. really does the trick in the microwave. i rinse it out when i'm through, let it dry for a few minutes, put it away. it works great! no complaints. also.......my original one is years old and is still perfect!!!"
5,Best Invention since the Wheel!,I have bought several of these over the years because every time someone walks in my kitchen and sees it they want it. Easy to clean and saves $$$ on paper towels. I can't live without it. Every home should have at least 2.
1,Not at all what I expected,This has got to be the biggest order surprise ever. I believed the good review but boy was I wrong. I'm sure they spent more money on the packaging than they did on manufacturing the item. It's merely a piece of netting with plastic cupboard bumpers glued around the edges. It's really hard to believe someone agreed to manufacture this item. Don't waste the time it takes to mail/ship this.
2,Overpriced,"A simple, mesh screen. frayed, unfinished edges. Lightweight red dots meant to keep the sides down but are too light to really do the job. It's worth about a buck, not nearly $5."
3,thin cover,the blanket cover is a wastejust use a paper towel and get it over with.You can never find it when you want it.
2,HOW DO YOU CLEAN IT??????????????,"ALL THE REVIEWS SAY TO JUST RINSE IT, BUT WHAT ABOUT IF YOU MICROWAVE FISH OR FOOD THAT HAS OILS IN IT...............JUST RINSING ISN'T ENOUGH.....SO WHERE FROM THERE?"
2,Food goes right through it!,"It worked fine the first 4 or so times I used it. I usually warm up soups in the microwave and one of the ingredients invariably explodes. The last time I used this screen, I was warming up an Indian dish. I covered the ceramic bowl with it and set the time to 2 minutes. I heard an explosion or two and thought - ha! I'm glad I covered it! When I opened the microwave door, I was not too happy to see that the food had gone right through the screen, making a mess all over the microwave. The screen was still sitting perfectly over the bowl though. I just don't think I can ever trust this thing again!"
3,OK.,"Does an OK job of preventing splatter. Wish the ""weights"" were a bit heavier. Does an OK job of preventing splatter"
3,The weights are too light,Weights are too light. Does not go in the dishwasher. Nordic Ware 65004 11-Inch Microwave Plate Coveris a better choice
1,Need to be able to put in dishwasher.,"Save your money and buy Nordic Ware Microwave 10.5 Inch Spatter Cover. Putting a cover in the dishwasher is a must. This is messy and gross to have on the counter even clean. The red ""weights"" are not very effective and the screen stains with tomato-basted foods."
2,Too flimsy,The little red beads just don't weigh enough to keep it down.For $1 at the dollar store that would be expected.Forget how much I paid for this but $1 sounds right.
4,Screen,We bought several of these to give to family and friends because we like how it work and everyone who received on also enjoys the product.
4,So far so good,These work great. I was concerned about using the plastic dome type because they say you are not suppose to put plastic in the microwave while heating your food. I would recommend them.
4,splatter screen,this works so well and the clean up is a breeze you only have to rinse it in the dish water and its done so easy so fast
5,A must for the kitchen.,The splatter screen is a very handy item. It's always there and I use it on most things I put in the microwave. It cleans easily. I originally purchased this item in a grocery store from a clip-strip. I was so happy to find them on the internet as the store no longer has them. I purchased one for each of my daughters as a stocking stuffer. I recommend them to everyone.
5,Works great,"I love this product, seriously I have used it for years! It is so easy to clean that the rest of the family will use it, so I DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN THE MICROWAVE. Throw it on the dish, it doesn't melt into your food. Yes it is very light and appears flimsy, but trust me, it does the job. Ordering 2 more for the kids, who are now grown. (I have had it that long)."
4,works well but...,"is this plastic? nowhere on the packaging does it say what the screen is made of. It would be nice to know, since a lot of people now avoid heating up foods in plastic containers due to health concerns. other than that, it is easy to clean and works as advertised."
4,Microwave Splatter Screen keeps the food under the screen.,I have had good results using the Microwave Splatter Screen. Nothing comes up above the screen; but oil has got along the base of the microwave on the plate and sides coming off the screen; but it is easy enough to wipe that clean. It is great not having food or oil going up on the sides and top inside the microwave.I found it easy to rinse off the oil and food that gets onto the screen. It dries pretty quickly as it is a thin mesh. I'm glad that I have bought it. It saves on having to buy paper towels all the time to cover food when cooking.
4,Does the job well,"I was surprised, because it's virutally weightless, that it prevented splatter on every bowl of anything I microwaved so far."
1,Waste of Money!!!!,"I don't blame Amazon because they are just the re-marketer for this product. This product is a farce. A 10 cent piece of cheese cloth would work as well. Weights around the edges??? I guess if you consider 8 tiny pieces of plastic about 1/2 the size of an M&M weights, then there is truth in that statement. Save your money. Just a note, this is actually the 1st bad review I have ever written about a product purchased through Amazon and I am a good customer."
3,pleasure to a man,"This video, was an attempt to teach how to give pleasure to a man, it was an alright try, but I found I didn't learn anything I didn't already know. It did have quite a few good examples of ways to variate techniques, but it wasn't the best demo video I've seen."
1,Let's Face It...,"Let's face it. Eminem is a douchebag. This video proves that conclusively. Self-absorbed, uninspired crap. Nuff said. And I should mention that those are the GOOD points!"
4,Very Useful Preperation Book,"I have actually the fourth edition of the book,and it is a very useful book for preperation to Professional Engineers'Examinations."
5,"He was clearly ""gold"" from the start!","I tuned in to PBS in the fall of 1997 and followed the progress of the various contestants shown. The program was clearly after the fact, but I had not heard who had won, so I was interested to see whom the judges had selected as the winners, and why. The Russians always field an outstanding team of artists, and those in competition that year were clearly excellent. But the minute Jon Nakamatsu began to play it was clear to me that he should be the gold medalist. He had not only maturity, poise and technique, he had the controlled passion that set the standard for others to match. I was pleased with myself (and the judges!) for recognizing someone who clearly was a leader. He was a joy to listen to, and to watch, and I strongly recommend this recording to anyone interested in a truly fine interpretation."
5,Masterful!,"Jon Nakamatsu played for us recently in Davidson, NC, and I must say that he has to be one of the five greatest living pianists extant. His exquisite precision and dextrous articulation is far from sterile, and he plays with enviable aplomb music which he colors most appropriately with just the right touch of expressivity.What a privilege to have heard and seen him live in concert! His CDs recall perfectly the thrill of his live(ly) performance."
1,Garbage,"Poorest quality, poorest everything, totaly a waste of time, and money. Wish Amazon had a ""0"" star rating, or a minus star rating."
2,I should know better by now,"I have been buying these compilation editions for about a year now. The DC books (except for most of the Batman ones) from the 50's and 60's have consistently been almost painful to read. It is hard to believe how strained the dialogue and writing were in comparison to the wonderful pictures and artwork.DC seemed to still be sure that they were writing for 11 and 12 year olds and that was never more evident in this Teen Titan first effort. It was about a group of kids so they tried really hard to write it the way they thought the teens of the day talked. I was a teen at that time, and I would have been embarassed to think anyone thought I sounded like that.In short, buy this if you need to complete some sort of collection (this is my only defense), but don't buy it for the reading value."
4,It would have been better had the selector selected more of the literate letters,"As someone who was there at the beginning of Star Trek and then saw it grow from a small to a mass movement, I am well aware of the role of fan letters in the expansion of interest. Some of that is clear from the letters highlighted in this book. Unfortunately while some of the letters are quite literate, many are not. They are crude and really do not demonstrate the power of the tsunami that turned Star Trek into a mainstream ideal. Some people wrote letters that were a blatant attempt to become famous and others were just trying to pitch a lame story idea. The best letters by far were from people who praise the role Star Trek had in motivating them to achieve more and figuratively reach for the stars. That is truly what Star Trek was all about and it is unfortunate that the selectors lost that focus when they were sifting through the documented mountain of mail generated by viewers of the show."
5,Nice banner,Very nice windshield banner. Adhesive seems very good as the quality of the vinyl on the banner. Reasonably priced. Would order again if needed. Well packaged also.
1,Terrible customer service,"I bought a Chub City toy like this, it was the Hummer version. I installed the batteries, followed every direction...and it never worked! The remote controller is a cheap piece of plastic, which when I opened the package there was something rattling around inside.As I purchased it another state, I was unable to return it...I wrote their customer service 4 TIMES, and never heard a word!!!!!!!!!!If you want a cheap, low quality toy made by a company with no customer service to back it up..buy this...or follow my recommendation..DON'T!! I'm giving it No Stars!"
4,Green Bear is a fun Bear,"My daughter loved this book when she was 3-4. There are lots of colors and lots of animals hiding in special places. Watch for the kitty! And a surprise at the end! If you like this one, try the others in the series, Red Rhino, Yellow Hippo, and Blue Tortoise."
2,arachnid? seen worse i suppose,"the beginning? guess some kind of alien creature brings a giant spider down with it when it crashes in the jungle, pretty cheesy beginning! hard to really listen close to what the actors were saying, accents were hard to understand. need to speak better english thats for sure. all in all pretty decent giant spider movie, was entertaining, will have to admit that. didn't care for the characters though, was hoping they'd all die out and that the spider would prevail but no such luck. just hope when Eight Legged Freaks comes out that it will be much better than this."
3,its ok... U gotta love spider movies!!,Its an ok movie. Its worth an rental. Its about an Island that has toxic spiders on it and when an Air Force plane flies accross the skies the jet plane electronic equipment mal-functions and goes down on an Island. The Pilot is now stranded and figures out that the island is infested with spider webs and hehe... Spiders.-Now an group of people are on a search for that missing pilot so now when there flys accros the ocean skies... guess what happens... there plane crashes due to unexpected malfuncions also... they crash on the same Island... now there hunted. Will they survive??? hummmm... just rent it.. its an ok movie!!
2,Hidden Trailers,On the main menu keep going down until you highlight the Lions Gate Logo. Click on it and you will be shown 3 trailers :1. Arachnid2. Spiders3. Risk
3,Alien bugs menace medical relief/research party.,"Arachnid has a group of scientists coming to the aid of a South Pacific island's residents, who are being menaced by strange bugs (which appear to be from outer space, or some parallel dimension, the film's interior logic is flawed, to say the least). The group becomes trapped and, one by one, the supporting cast members fall prey to nasty bugs of all shapes and sizes. Genre veteran Jack Shoulder (Alone in the Dark, The Hidden, and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) keeps the pace swift and tension passable. This movie won't win any awards, but it's a nifty little addition to the creature feature genre."
1,Overpriced,"This model was much more expensive than other brands because it was made from ""Sony"". I believed the product will meet my expectations since it was more expensive than Samsung or LG.Anyways after using it for a monthI already have two dead pixels(both RED). And very frequently I get these white pixels which I need to press with a cotton swab so it turns back to normal.Save your money and go for another product!"
2,Not just outdated,"Aside from the listings that are out of date there are errors about what took place when and who was born where. If you simply must visit the site of a certain event or birth place of a famous person, you had better check another source before making a three hour drive."
5,Great little mp3 player,"Only had it a few days, so I can't speak to the durability or battery life, just first impressions and those are great.It's small, light and has great sound. My only complaint (and it's a nitpick) would be that the lowest volume setting is actually pretty loud compared to most players.Small screen but nice interface, lots of options (you can even flip the display in case you want to see it from the other side).Bought mine at the store and it came with a belt loop and arm band, no neck strap like is listed here.It was easy for me to get songs loaded on my XP box, just drag/drop like a flash drive.FM radio has surprisingly good reception.PROS: Small, lightweight, 1Gb, easy to use controls, great FM reception, great sound.CONS: Uses AAA battery (maybe a pro for you, I prefer built in rechargable)Great player!"
2,Bad Batch!!,"There is a ""bad batch"" of Zen Nano Plus MP3 players. I unfortunately got one of them. I changed batteries and when I tried to play my songs that I downloaded from WalMart it kept shutting off! I e-mailed the company and they told me to run a program on the MP3. It deleted all of my songs but I had them backed up. I tried it again and it did the same thing. I called customer service and got a very helpful customer service person. He told me there was a ""bad batch"" of players out there that won't play the WalMart downloads if there is a new battery in them. My options are to deplete the battery first or use rechargable batteries. After 9 hours of messing around with this thing and depleting the battery I got it to work again. They said they might have a solution to the problem at the end of the summer but until then I am supposed to use low juice batteries. If you purchase this player download from another music store besides WalMart. Good luck!"
4,Better because it's cheaper,"This has turned out to be one of my favorite toys. It works nicely as an mp3 player, and it's a surprisingly decent radio and voice recorder as well. I've gotten my money's worth and much more out of this. My wife has the 512 mb version, and she's just as happy with hers.Pros: Tiny; drag-n-drop file transfer; mp3 and WMA format; replaceable battery.Cons: Controls and interface take some figuring out; plastic body might not last forever."
3,Marvin Gaye - Behind the Legend,"Poor video quality. The best part is the concert under bonus, where he proform, Let's get it on & some Medley's. Other than that very poor quality. But if you are like me I love Marvin so I had to have it."
3,"salsa, son, y jazz latino a estilo viejo","Los musicos de esta produccion son veteranos fuertes. Aqui estan combinados de forma en la cual no se habia visto antes. Isaac Delgado, Andy Montañez, Chucho Valdez, NG la Banda, Giovanni Hidalgo, Tony Cala, varios vanvaneros, y otros mas.Lo que no me gusto es que la produccion fue un poco conservativa. Con tantos timberos espere mas timba con un sabor fuerte y despues escucho a Isaac Delgado y Roberton cantando unas salsas suave. Andy Montañez con Chucho Valdez tocan un danzon-salsa que fue directo al estilo de Andy, fabuloso. La primera cancion con Jenny de Los Van Van, la unica timba del album, tambien increible. Pero porque NG la Banda toco jazz, no me explico.Desafortunadamente los Cubanos me decepcionaron, cambiando su estilo timbero agresivo en este album. Por eso no puedo darle mas de 3 estrellas. En cambio si a usted le gusta una salsa calmada y chevere con jazz latino este sera una buena adicion a su coleccion."
3,Too many F bombs,Ted talks too much and doesnt focus enough on what made him great. Too many F-bombs dropped in thid DVD. I saw him live and loved the show. I dont recall it being like this DVD. Anyway he rocks and the quality of sound and picture is good.
2,No Tommy Aldridge Drumming,"I am a huge Fan of Tommy Aldridge (former OZZY & Whitesnake) and his drumming on the ""Full Bluntal.."" CD. Having seen Ted opening for KISS I was blown away by the power Trio of Ted, Marco, and Tommy (Aldridge). Ted's songs where always Good but with this lineup playing up to his intensity, they where great. Compare the ""Full Bluntal..."" CD to any other Ted CD and they pale in pure rock energy. Unfortunatly the DVD bearing the same title does not have ""Tommy Aldridge"" but ""Tommy Clufetos"". The magic is gone and its just another back up band playing behind Ted Nugent not with him. Should have filmed DVD when they recorded the CD. Or not used same title for DVD.Saddly Disapointed to not see one of the greatest rock drummers ever, the one, only and irreplaceable, Tommy Aldridge."
1,SHOT LIKE A CHEAP PORNO,Love Uncle Ted.Film is shot like a cheap porno.Cant crank it up. Audio lousy. Not punchy at all. Video is home style as well. Poor production all around.
1,I put this dvd in the garbage can!!,"This dvd is an old Ted doing songs from yesteryears!!! Do you understand me people!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!! This is not Ted in his prime,this is a retired Ted trying to cash in!! Do not be fooled by the stupid reviews saying this is good!! And do not be fooled be the idiot stars!!! I did buy this and through it in the garbage after watching it once!!"
1,Ted Nugget: What a loser,"Ted Nugget,A truly worthless guy. Overrated, underdeveloped, and marginally talented. I'm surprised that any worthwhile production company would take on a project such as this. Someone please tell this nut to get a life, and remind him that a real man doesn't need to kill animals with a bow and arrow to make up for the dried up piece of dog jerky in his pants."
5,NUGENT OUT ROCKS ANYBODY,TED NUGENT IS BY FAR THE BEST GUITAR PLAYER IN THE WORLD AND THIS DVD PROVES IT.IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY .THE NUGE NEVER SOUNDED BETTER OR PLAYED BETTER.I SEEN TED IN CONCERT 26 TIMES DATING BACK TO 1982 AND HE STILL OUT ROCKS JUST ABOUT ANYBODY.
5,Ted Nugent - One hell of a guitar player & showman,"I have over 40 rock DVD's and this one smokes all the rest. Nobody plays with such intensity and nobody rocks you like Ted. The start of the concert will blow you away and make you laugh really hard, it's a surprise I won't ruin. Drummer Tommy Clufetos and bassist Marco Mendoza are on fire, they have to be, to be able to keep up with Ted. Stormtroopin', Hey Baby, Cat Scratch Fever, and Stranglehold are some of the highlghts. The bonus songs from Cal Jam II show Ted at his best in the 70's. This DVD will rock your world, a must for Ted Nugent fanatics!!!!Michael A Alcini - Las Vegas"
5,Spirit of Ted Nugent still rockin,This dvd is a real pleasure. It will remind all Ted Nugent fan's how great the Motor City Madman really is.
5,A Great Show,"Folks may disagree (perhaps rightly) with Ted's political views, but that debate belongs in another venue. As this DVD amply demonstrates, Ted is a highly capable guitar slinger and, what's more, he's one of the few guitar players since the peerless Jimi Hendrix to make feedback an integral part of his playing.Highly entertaining, and highly recommended, as is his Double Live Gonzo CD set."
5,Good Product,Exactly what I needed. Well worth the money. I liked it so well I ordered others for my children. Easy to install.
5,No more shifting,The seat my builders installed does not have a very secure mounting and would work itself loose over time. The bumpers solved my problem. They were easy to install.
4,Something unique,"Haven't tackled putting these on because drilling holes need to be done, will wait to make sure I want to use them.."
5,"The BEST invention in modern times, bar none.","These are absolutely the best invention for keeping the toilet seat from slipping. I found a set over 12 years ago at my old house, and now need them for my cabin. I have looked all over for these, and you cannot find them at the hardware stores any more! My brother, a home remodeler, never saw these until he saw the ones I found and installed myself, and marveled at the ingeniousness. Googling all over for these, I just went on a chat board where an elderly woman needed just such a thing, and people were trying to tell her she needed an elevated toilet or a special seat costing hundreds of dollars! This is it ladies and gentlemen. This is all you need. That slippage is what cracks your toilet seat too. Thank you, for still making these. You really need to market them out there better."
3,Compac Toilet Seat Stabilizers,"Wished more info had been put in the online description. The elastic is only a temporary hold. They work, but they aren't great."
4,Good product,It held the seat in place. It stopped the seat from sliding and wobbling when I sit on the seat.
5,Top-Notch Bluegrass Music!,"You read the label and see that this group is comprised of members of the U.S. Navy Band. Well, don't be fooled by any pre-conceived notions - this is as good a bluegrass ensemble as you will ever hear. Lead singer Wayne Taylor has a great voice and a dynamic delivery that pulls you right into the songs. And the banjo player, Keith Arneson is a virtuouso picker with at least six fingers on his right hand! A fantastic group and a totally enjoyable experience - highly recommended."
2,Definitely not for 13 year olds,"The movie is clever, but the rating is misleading. It is sexually explicit and contains nudity."
3,Slightly disappointed,"As usual, Depp turns in a wonderful performance as Dun Juan. Unfortunately, I felt that Brando was just stumbling along as he has in all of his recent performances (Dr. Moreau anyone?). Despite this, the movie makes a good case for love and the outlook that all men should have.It matters little whether Depp's character really is physically Don Juan, because he shows that he IS Don Juan in spirit and that everyone has a bit of that spirit within."
3,a good message; a bad movie,"The plot of this movie carries an excellent message, but tons of gratuitous nudity, some bizarrely timed humor, a certain amount of ongoing refusal to distinguish between love and lust, and what looks to me like extreme cynicism on the part of the screenwriter make it awfully hard to get at that message.The basic plot is that eternal question: Who's truly insane, the madman living a rich and fulfilling life, or the doctor who tries to convince him to give that life up in favor of the soul-deadening ""reality"" that society has agreed upon?The sad thing is that this could easily have been an excellent movie; Depp and Brando, especially, have a few of those lines that will stick with you forever, and the character of Donna Ines really touched me, too. But at times a certain sardonic tone is taken (especially in the corniness of ""Donna Ana's"" appearance in the ending), which suggests that somebody was determined to dilute the impact of an extremely powerful moral."
4,Of course it is not realistic - so what?,"Johnny Depp, Marlin Brando, Fay Dunnaway - it works. And a really interesting, if light hearted, look at ""who are the crazy ones""?Watch for the woman Don Juan seduces in the opening act, later at the same restaurant."
4,Don Juan,My girlfriend says this one is a nice romantic movie its also about a young dude claiming to be Don Juan Demarco who winds up in a newyork psych facility its a really decent flick.
3,ok,"In the meantime, the films look great, and this is the best version available for home viewing. but not have audio in spanish to my parents dont like read subtitles.."
4,Don Juan DeMarco,"The interplay between the characters of Don Juan and Don Octavio is full of warmth and caring. A real ""feel good"" movie. A treasure to watch Marlon Brando in one of his last films. Johnny Depp creates a character of sincerity and humor. The film asked us each to question for ourselves what is sane and what is not sane. You are left to draw you own conclusion."
5,Great movie on how to regain love in life,"The underline of this movie is great and gives room for thought. Johnny Deep plays the character of Don Juan, the 'greatest lover in the world' in whoms arms a woman 'has never been left unsatisfed'. Tired of his mundane, boring life in New York, he creates a life of imagination and passion which is long dead in the majority of people's lives. Brando plays the psychiatrist who is to 'cure' Depp of this love and passion, considering this a sickness in the beginning, rather than the sickness of his own monotonous and mundane existance. The psychiatrist becomes the actual patient, and 'Don' teaches him how to gain passion back into his own world and marriage. Brando sets-up a plot which will please the board of psyhiatrists and encourage them to release Don Juan-Depp from the rehabilitation program that is to make Juan just as 'normal' as everyone else. Ultimately, the movie conveys, life becomes what we make out of it."
4,"Funny, light-hearted, romantic comedy","Probably not everyone's taste, but I enjoyed this movie very much. It is a story about a young man (Johnny Depp) who believes he is Don Juan DeMarco and he tells his story to his shrink to prove he isn't crazy. Not a realist movie, but quite good."
5,Enthusiastic thumbs up,"One of my all time favorite films...this one is a good time! Sexy without much sex, sophisticated humor, and another fantastic role for Johnny Depp (one of the best actors today)... I recommend this film to all I know. Like all good stories, it unfolds its magic with a unique plot, great dialog, interesting characters and great performances. Yet, it is the psychology at work here that breathes the life throughout this film. This story gives you ""new eyes""...it makes you look at your own life in a new way, and that puts it in a category of greatness. Watch as the dull and routine marriage of Dunaway and Brando blossoms with new life and excitement, through contact with Depp's delusional fantasy. For those of us who have been married a long time, this story is a treat! --J. Addie"
2,DVD buying,Delivery of item was Painfully Slow. Purchased on 12/14/07 - did not receive untill 1/10/08. THAT'S TOO SLOW.
4,Made for TV,"This movie wasn't good but it wasn't bad either. The story line was bland and colorless. The characters however were good. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a romantic comedy, it wasn't all that funny as it was cutsie. This seemed like a tv made for television. Kind of hoaky but barable. If you are a fan of Brando, Dunaway or Depp this movie will please you."
2,Hated it,"Johnny Depp is not convincing. The plot is strange, trite, and annoying.Brando needs to give up acting. He's extremely unconvincing and fat."
4,Another great Johnny Depp movie!,"I admit I was attracted to this movie by the fact that Johnny Depp was in it, but I found myself moved by the movie more than I was drooling over the guy. (His performance is great in this movie, but if you`re looking to squeal at him watch ""Benny & Joon."") Somehow I could relate to Don Juan in this movie, just in the way that he lives in a fantasy world. The message of the movie (in my opinion) is that reality and imagination are two different worlds but none is more real than the other. I like movies like this that leave you to piece together your own opinion on what really happened after it`s over. And the DVD is pretty cool; it has a clip included from ""Freddy`s Dead"" from back in '91, if you want to see teenage Johnny Depp get knocked out with a skillet."
2,Don Juan DeMarco,"My husband and I enjoyed the movie. I saw it when it was first released. However, this CD skipped, stopped and sometimes completely lost portions of the movie. It was irritating to try to watch."
3,GREAT DEPP QUERKY FUN,"Although not the best vehicle for Marlon Brando and Faye Dunaway, Johnny Depp definitely steals the show with his querky portrayal of a mental patient philosophy on life. If you are a Depp fan, this is definitely one to add to your video library."
5,Wow..,funny and inspiring.. Makes women wish they know someone like this.. Any man who would like to have a happy wife/partner/sister/mother/aunt.etc should study this film !!!
5,Must see for Johnny Depp fans,Johnny Depp as a psychotic who thinks he is Don Juan; and Marlon Brando as the psychiatrist. What could be better?Great show. Must see for all Johnny Depp fans.
3,johnny depp flick,"the movie is average at best with a hard to believe story line. it was rated average instead of poor because johnny depp is alway nice to admire and look at in a movie, he has that great charisma. i would recommend it for purchase only if you are a diehard depp fan."
4,"Ah, romance!","I have never been able to resist Johnny Depp, nor do I wish to. His ""ordeal"" in the sultan's harem alone was worth the price of admission."
5,Don Juan,"This movie brings together very big Big names like Marlon Brando, Faye Dunaway and Johnny Depp but also an incredible romantic scenario in which Deep is brought to Brando (who's going to retire) in a Clinic because tried suicide. In a week's delay, Deep must persuade Brando that he's Don Juan De Marco ..."
5,Don Juan DeMarco,I found this film to be very very sweet.It keeps one guessing all the way to the end.I have watched it several times.Not only do you get a great proformance from Johnny Depp (as ALWAYS) but you get to see Marlon Brando.This a movie that any Johnny Depp or Brando fan will love.Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"""A Mask Of Another Sort"" ~ Physician Heal They Self","The '95 cinematic release 'Don Juan De Marco' is one of those films that define what the genre lovingly known as ""chick flick"" is all about. You've got a youthful, enthusiastic Johnny Depp in his prime emoting more inner pain and existential angst than any self respecting woman could endure, an aging Marlon Brando who probably still elicites a few fond, romantic memories from the older ladies in the viewing audience and a withered marital relationship that almost everyone can identify with. What more could you ask for?Warning: For all the males out there. Stay away, I repeat, stay away from this one. As far away as you possibly can! Out of the house would be good and don't return home until several hours have passed since the conclusion of the movie. Enough said."
4,Much much better than expected,"I was put off by the opening here, thinking I was in for some sort of lame costume drama. Then, with Brando's appearance as a portly shrink about to retire, it took on a sort of TV-movieish quality. Still, along the way, I got caught up in the feel-good storyline and the positive messages about the power of love and romance. Young Johnny Depp does a great job here as a delusional youngster, keeping his Spanish accent almost perfect throughout. Brando, nearing the end of his career, came up with the goods, too. Well worth a watch, especially if you want a mood enhancer."
3,Fantastic Movie Marred by Miserable DVD Transfer,"I'm not going to say a word about the film itself. Other reviewers have handled that task, and if you have a romantic bone in your body you know that this is one of the most glorious romantic love movies ever created.Instead, the three stars is a protest against the cheap, sloppy DVD transfer, and a demand that this film get the technical treatment it deserves. As it stands, the video transfer is so grainy that on my plasma TV it looks like it was created by someone filming the VHS version being shown on a TV screen with a handheld camcorder.Plus, the sound is by Mushmouth Studios, courtesy of Oatmeal Joe. Contrary to how it sounds, Marlon Brando does NOT spend this film with his cheeks full of marbles the way he did in ""The Godfather,"" but you could never tell.This film deserves the ""Criterion Collection"" treatment. Let's hope that we see it in Blu-Ray, and that the Blu-Ray version does it justice."
5,Don Juan DeMarco is one of the best.,"Both Johnny Depp and Marlon Brando turn in star performances in this quirky little movie. Depp is a modern Brando who takes everything that he does and turns it into a better film. Brando could have played this one with his eyes closed, but instead decided to envolope the part and turn it into a performance. The story is only so so. However, the interplay between these two actors is amazing to watch."
5,Irresistable Little Movie,"The on screen chemistry between Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp is what makes this such a pleasure to watch. Brando is fabulous even when just sitting and listening to Depp recount his stories of romantic conquests and Depp is equally convincing to the viewer that he may just be Don Juan and not only a patient in a NY Psychiatric hospital.This is a movie that is incredibly sweet and it draws you into Depp's fantasy world (or is it) as he is being treated for his delusions.Brando and Depp together- a tremendous combination, created a not to be missed movie."
4,One of the Best Date Movies,"Looking to spark up your relationship? Rent or buy this movie! Johnny Depp is brilliant as a young man suffering from a delusion of being Don Juan DeMarco, the world's greatest lover. Marlon Brando is his psychiatrist who slowly is infected by Depp's delusion. The film is witty, cleverly written and superbly acted by Brando, Depp, and Faye Dunaway (playing Brando's wife), with supporting performances by Rachel Ticotin and Talisa Soto. It is a chance to see one of the finest actors of our generation (Depp) try out his acting chops toe-to-toe with the greatest actor of any generation (Brando). Pay particular attention to a sequence when Brando wordlessly reacts to Depp's re-telling of his father's tragic death. It is pure magic."
4,A MODERN DAY FABLE,"Boosted by star turns from Marlon Brando, Faye Dunaway and the amazingly talented Johnny Depp, DON JUAN DEMARCO is a modern day fairy tale, a fable that asks if an illusionary life is all that bad, and if it's not hurting the person with those illusions, should he be locked up in an institution? Brando plays the psychiatrist who ten days before his retirement takes on the case of Don Juan De Marco, a young man who claims he is the real Don Juan and tells his fantastic story to Brando. Brando's own love life with Faye Dunaway improves and Brando is convinced that maybe Depp IS Don Juan. There are some humorous and poignant moments, and the cast plays their roles impeccably. Not your standard type of romance or comedy flick, DON JUAN DEMARCO gives us a fable which reveres love and femininity, while giving us men a few creative suggestions to improve our own romantic magic."
3,A little bit cold,"Karl Richter certainly has his strong points no doubt about it, but I find this recording a bit sterile, something that might work well with mid-sized 12 tone music. Richter runs his tempos a little faster than I like. I would like a little more warmth. As is the case with many musicians, if you like that style, fine. However, it is rare to find a performer who speaks to everybody, and Richter certainly does not have that gift."
5,"Correction On Author of song ""Sopa de Caracol""","The Original name of this song is ""Conch Soup"" which means in Spanish ""Sopa de Caracol"". The Author's name is Chico Ramos, (an African descendant and now more widely known as ""Garifuna""} is a citizen of the country of Belize, the ONLY English speaking country in Central America, situated between Guatemala & Mexico on the Caribbean shore. Chico Ramos wrote this song while living in Stann Creek (now known as ""Dangriga"")in 1987 and became a Hit in the country of Belize during the Independence Celebrations of Belize in the month of September of that same year. All rights and mentions for the words and music of this song should be given to Mr. Ramos.The Hondurans (La Banda Blanca) made this song their own when they presented it on UNIVISION for the first time. Up to today this song is played by Banda Blanca and sang in Garifuna dialect although the members are not Garifuna in anyway."
4,great but...,"I would give this a 5 star but it is a bit drying to the coat without the conditioner which I plan to order now that I know this. Otherwise, great great great product. No tangles in my border collie (even though I didn't condition--just dry) and all of my longcoat chihuahua's brushed out fantastic. Smells and lathers great too!"
2,Wouldn't ship to me,THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE PRODUCT AS I HAVE NOT TRIED IT. They wouldn't ship to me and no explanation of why. I live in San Francisco Bay Area. I don't know why this product was 'restricted' from being shipped here.
5,Works great!!!,"After picking our dog up from the ""doggy resort"" we noticed she was itching on and off. We looked and we might find one flea. We noticed our other dog would itch on and off also. We used this soap and vacuumed the carpets a lot and they are itch free. When we used the soap we also used the special flea comb that we bought, which when combined made a huge difference in ""finding"" the culprits. I do not know how well it work if your dog had a bad case of fleas, but it worked well on our dogs for the minimal fleas they had. The soap smelled good, but I really did not notice the smell on the dogs or for that matter how long it stayed on the dogs. Both of our dogs are indoor pets and only tend to stink if they go outside to potty in the rain, or if it is really hot out, so I really can not comment on the smell. Overall I liked the soap and would definitely order it again. One of the reason I bought it, besides the flea thing was that it is natural, which is a huge plus."
3,Not What I Expected,"For some reason I thought that this was a much longer work, or possibly even a collection of Frost's poems. I missed the other reviews that explained that this is a children's book.Although I was initially excited by this book, I was left with an unsatisfactory feeling.The illustrations did not surpass those common to other children's books. For a better example of what can be done see those inThe Three Snow Bears.Finally, seeing the lines ""And miles to go before I sleep,And miles to go before I sleep."" placed in such a naive context was ultimately unsettling."
4,A Pretty Poem,This is just a well-presented version of a pretty Frost poem that I remember from my childhood.It brings back memories.
2,New Edition is SMALLER Format,"The poem is great, as always. However, I'm disappointed in the changes to the Susan Jeffers illustrations. In the original version of the book, 8.5 x 11"" (approx),the illustrations are finer, more deilicate. In the new, smaller format (7 x 8.5""), the lines are cruder, fuzzier, and someone has added a lot more color. It detracts from the lovely, icy, wind-blown quality of the original art. In my local bookstore, they are not even able to order a copy in the original format. It's a shame. I don't know why the publisher has decided to mangle a beautiful book. I've bought and given as gifts numerous copies of the original version. I won't buy the ""new"" version."
5,Just as I pictured it,"When illustrators provide their visual representation of a well-loved story or poem, I'm often disappointed. That's not how I pictured it, I complain.Well, not in this case. I love this poem dearly, with both ""promises to keep"" and ""miles to go before I sleep"" being recurring themes in how I think about what I need to get done each week. And behind the philosopy is the image of a bearded man driving his carriage through the snow on the way home to his waiting family. My father, I think, is the guy in my mental images of this.The artwork in this book is absolutely delightful, and serves to make more vivid the images that were already in my mind. I love the poem, I love the art, and I love sharing these things with my daughter, who also loves this book."
3,"Love the interpretations, hate the revamped illustrations","As another reviewer posted, this is a marvelous interpretation of Robert Frost's timeless poem. I read the original to my son and he now reads it to his son. I think it's a great child's introduction to the great works of Robert Frost. The problem is that the original edition had far better illustrations. I would recommend the original hardcover edition published in 1978. It appears to be available thru Amazon Partners. If you can find a clean addition, buy it, it's wonderful."
5,Beautiful!,"I have the older edition. The pictures are a beautiful enhancement for the poem, which is one of my favorites. I also recommend a collection of Frost's complete poems - they are excellent to read to children."
5,A beautfiul book!,I bought this book for my mother to read to her granchildren. The Robert frost poem is one of her favorites and I knew she would enjoy sharing it with them. The illustrations far surpased what I expected. The quality and beauty of the work has inspired me to purchase another book for giving to a new mother. Highly recommended!
4,What Songs are Included?,"As of the date of this posting, there were no album tracks on this page. Here's a rundown of the tracks and they're great. 1)ON AND ON 2)UNFAITHFULLY YOURS 3)LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT ONE 4)SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY 5)MADGE 6)ONE MORE NIGHT 7)FALLIN' 8)ONLY THE HEART WITHIN YOU 9)THE BIG HOUSE 10)IT MIGHT BE YOU 11)IF LOVE TAKES YOU AWAY 12)SEND A LITTLE LOVE MY WAY 13)SOMEONE'S IN LOVE 14)RED CAB TO MANHATTAN 15)SEPERATE LIVES. Don't know why they didn't post tracks. This is one of the better compilations."
4,"Good compilation for its time, but not perfect","Of all the SB compilations issued, this one and the firstMCA one (11035) are the best.The major hits are here, along with some of his soundtrackwork and a few album tracks.SB's liner notes are adequate, but the package gives verylittle info on recording personnel - would've been niceto have, especially for the soundtrack material."
1,way too heavy,"Not much of a ""portable"" table at this weight. Also, it doesn't exactly pop up quickly; we wouldn't be able to pack it up and pop it back out night after night during camping. There just aren't a lot of choices in travel tables, unfortunately."
4,Easy to use.,"I researched rock tumblers carefully before deciding on this particular one. I am thrilled with how easy it is for my 11 year old to use. The one thing we were not prepared for was the length of time each of the 4 steps takes to complete (up to 7 days for each step). Which means, your tumbler runs, 24 hours a day for nearly 4 weeks. While this one is relatively quiet, especially compared to cheaper versions, be prepared for the drone of the tumbler for extended periods of time. If you youngin' is impatient, this might not be the best choice of hobbies as it is time consuming and there is NOTHING to look at for weeks at a time. On the other hand, this produced some gorgeous polished rocks with little effort."
2,Takes too long. Noisy. Weak Motor.,"Bought this for my 5 year old nephew. We thought it would make a great gift for the holidays. Then we read the instructions. Here are the cons:1. (Time)There are 4 stages to polishing and the whole process can take 17 days. Let me emphasize: the machine has to be running almost constantly for 17 days (minimum).2. (Noise)The polisher consists of a sealed container mounted on a gyroscope run by a motor. When running, the motor and the assembly are noisy. I would not buy this is if I lived in an apartment. Even in the house, I can hear it from 1 floor away.3. (Weak motor)I might be persuaded to recommend this product if not for the weak motor. The machine has a tendency to ""stick"". The tumbler stops tumbling and you've got to nudge it to get it going again. I started the first stage three days ago and I've had to nudge it 10 times. This can only add time to the process."
1,Rock Tumbler,"It takes about 16 days to complete a cycle, which is normal. However, unit STOPPED working on 14th day. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME USING IT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, NEW. Don't waste your money."
2,Too many steps - too much time,"It takes at least 16 days to get polished rocks with several steps to e taken at eacer phase. Also, not enough rough rocks in initial package for the $80 dollars paid. Discovery Kids offered it at $30 dollars less on its website. However I did not see the reduced pricing until after my item was shipped from Amazon - on the same day of order. I also did not want to chance not getting it before Christmas."
3,Just so-so,"I'm not really sure why this novel won so many awards and acclaims in another country but I don't see it winning much in the US. With that being said, I think its not a bad novel. Not great, but not terrible. The problem I had with it was this: these people are too cerebral. They think too much. They don't let things just ""happen."" The main character, Raya Mira, thinks constantly, about motherhood, being an artist, can she be both at once, can she also be a wife, does she lose part of one when she becomes another.....and on and on. I think she really misses out on the enjoyment of just BEING. Raya Mira disappears one day and leaves her husband Gideon (who narrates the novel) to figure out the whys and wheres of her disappearance. The story is definitely an intriguing one but I saw this going so many different ways. Really, it just goes nowhere. It is an entertaining little storyline, as long as you dont think too much."
1,Don't waste your money,"Tool is absolutely useless, very disappointed in Camco. One end broke immediately, so I welded it back on. My welded end then held, but then the other end immediately broke -- trash time!!"
4,Saiyuki fan,This is the on going story of the Saiyuki saga. Not a disappoint for any Saiyuki fan. A great buy but the only sad thing is that a new company does the dub-english from the first season epis. Their pronouce of a couple of name gets on your nervous.
4,Soccer Team Tent,"This is the third pop-up canopy we have used since our team formed 4 years ago. All of them are similar - The most important features are straightforward, easy opening operations, a ventilated top so it doesn't get sucked off the ground when it's windy, provision to add sides, easy opening pins at the top and a durable carry bag with wheels. Amazon had these at least $20 less than anyone else. If you need to drag it on rough terrain (grass, asphalt, gravel) I suggest you get an inexpensive aluminum luggage rack to preserve the bag. Once it is ripped and the tent won't stay in it's very cumbursome to carry around. The metal legs are very durable but the expandable roof framing is vulnerable to damage and if you lose a pin from the top of any of the legs it will not stay up anymore. This one appears to have easy to open pins. Don't forget to pull it back out and dry it out after use or it will get moldy and lessen the life of the fabric."
3,The book is better.,"The book by this title is phenomenally well written and enjoyable. The movie was just metiocre, because the lead was cast with a one dimensional, flat actor whose acting never allowed me to suspend my disbelief. Read the book if you have the time."
3,The Illustrated Man,"For hard-core fans of old science fiction, and those movies, and of the author Ray Bradbury. Performances are good. Budget is modest, for science fiction. Few special effects."
4,Ray Bradbury's Illustrated Man,this dvd arrived in excellent time and excellent condition. It is just as good as i remembered.
3,seen too long ago,"Received the dvd in perfect condition and under ten days.The story is quite ok but does tend to peter out towards the end,may have been in a different state of mind when I first saw it,when it first came out."
5,MIND BLOWING,"This is one of my most favorite movies it makes you think and thats good if a writer can do that. you must see and own this one. Rod Steiger was born for this one he was perfect for this part, Claire Bloom laked something but still did a good job. if they want a movie to remake with todays cg this is one to do."
1,"Steiger is great, but ...","Rod Steiger gives a great performance in this one. He is very disturbing. I was VERY disappointed with the movie though. It is very slow and does not even come close to living up to the book. Yes ... it is very surreal and builds some atmosphere, but it basically made me yawn after the first 30 minutes and wonder how the screen writer got so far away from the book. Read the book and pass on this one."
2,"Some interesting scenes, not worth a full viewing.",Interesting only to hardcore Bradbury fans. Not a very compelling movie. Boring at times.
2,A very shallow screen adaptation of Ray Bradbury's work,"Ray Bradbury is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. Some of his literary creations have been presented in films and television specials and some of them have been presented well. Unfortunately, this film didn't quite do a good job at transferring Bradbury's novel from book print to the screen. Steiger's talents are really wasted here as the man covered with tattoos (he keeps reminding the young man: ""....boy, these are not tattoos; they are SKIN ILLUSTRATIONS!"") who is searching for the mysterious woman who surreptitiously planted them on his body. A trilogy of futuristic scenarios are presented here that are really shallow and slow moving to keep most viewers interested. After a while, I started to wonder if this thing was ever going to end; I felt this was a waste of time to watch after it did reach a conclusion."
2,vcr tape review,"Not in very good condition, took most of MOVIE time to get a picture due to the TV TRACKING!"
4,Interesting... but maybe not for everyone,"It is possible that some viewers may find this classic late 60'ssci-fi not up to the standard of Ray Bradbury's creative style. But since childhood, I have always enjoyed this movie. Rod Steiger (one of my favorite actors) is unique and believable in his role as the ""illustrated man"", and Claire Bloom is beautiful as always. The movie gets a bit slow in parts but somehow with the musical score is mysterious and entertaining. If you enjoyed 451 I think you will be pleased with this captivating film."
4,Save it for a rainy day,"Firstly, this is an unusual movie. Don't get hire it out for a Friday night video session with friends. Someone is bound to demand you take it off, and so you may get put off and never see it. One wonders how it ever made it into production since it has virtually no mass market appeal. It is a little rough in execution and it is not something one can watch passively.The film approaches the task of interpreting the book by presenting the stories as distinct events within the stream on consciousness of the writer: as the experience of lives within a life.The scenes dealing with the merging of reality with virtual reality are very powerful. The film was well ahead of its time in 1969.I'll not say more, since I try not to give plots away, but I will tell you this. You will miss out on an extra treat if you don't watch it on a day when it is raining cats and dogs, if it has been raining all week it is even better."
3,"Yes, same ""Four in the Morning""","Indeed, the ""Four in the Morning"" on this CD is the version taken from the original Capitol album ""Soul of a City Boy."" I fell under the spell of this song when it was played by Billy Bass on WMMS in Cleveland in 1969, at a time when I just happened to be taping his program. I added it to my own repertoire, and searched in vain myself for many years for the original album (I still even remember the catalog number: Capitol T2070!).Capitol did reissue ""Soul of a City Boy"" briefly on LP sometime in the 70s or 80s, and I got a copy then. The rest of it is rather standard blues fare; there's nothing on it quite as wonderful as ""Four in the Morning."" Jesse also did a rather ill-advised electric remake of this song on the first Youngbloods album.I love Jesse's voice; he's a great talent, but to me the rest of his solo stuff pales next to his work with The Youngbloods, and of course, the original ""Four in the Morning."" Nice to see that it reached someone else too!"
2,utility/printer cart,"First of all, when the cart finally arrived one of the wheels was broken. Where ever the cart shipped from claimed that we had to take a picture of the busted cart and wheel and forward it to them before they would fulfill our request. They also said that it would take several weeks to ship another. However, my husband eventually notified Sauder who shipped another wheel within 2 days at no charge. The cart is currently serving its purpose, holding our printer and kids books. However, I do wish that it did have a plywood backing so that items would not fall off the back of the shelves. But it is what it is considering the cost."
5,Kohler Escale Pedestal Sink,"One word - WOW! This sink is absolutely modern and oh, so beautiful. You get the look of the new wall basin sinks plus a pedestal bottom to hide those pipes! The sink anchors to the wall and the 39"" across really looks perfect centered on a smaller wall. This is a really beautiful product and has made our powder room the nicest bathroom in the house!P.S. The Symbol faucet is the one recommended by Kohler for this sink but we purchased the Purist faucet and it looks even better as it's a little bigger and not as streamlined."
3,Early 'Sin' of Nicole Kidman,Ok for huge fans of the Kidman - but nevertheless rather an attempt to make late money with a no name movie who's one cast member luckily became a star than a must seen!
4,Beautiful guide,"for anyone who intends or plans to own a sheltie, this is a beautiful guide to the breed. The pictures are lovely, showcasing many different kinds of shelties. I myself own a blue merle, a tri, and a white faced, blue eyed but tri towards the back sheltie. The author writes in a breezy, friendly, ""English"" flair that I'm familiar with, having attended British schools overseas. Lovely book. You will not be dissapointed."
3,The new Mallenium...,"Pretty good as compilations go...Some not so good songs but they are made up for by a tight Ray Luv song, a tight Regime ft. Ray Luv and Mac Mall song, and pretty good songs from both JT The Bigga Figga and Mopreme. The RnB side really isn't my thing though so I give the cd 3 stars. Although the song by Shima is pretty good as well as the song by D.Wiggins and Mac Mall."
5,he got me wide open,"i love mac mall and the bay he represents (BIG O, THE TOWN, O-A-K-L-A-N-D, etc.) anyway i give him major props. he's doing it over and over again. i esp. want to thank him and show congrts for his song wide open. it helped me respect myself and figure out what to look for in somebody else. it also let me know there is still some good men out there!!!! Killa Kali"
1,Don't buy if you actually plan on using it.,"This thing is a piece of junk. Not knowing anything about yoga mats, I made the mistake of being lazy and grabbing this at the local sporting goods store figuring all mats are created equal. It began falling apart after 3 uses! Chunks of it are coming out and it's basically disintegrating after each use."
5,A must for Blake fans.,"This is the best book on Blake that I have read bar none. For an all around introduction to the prophetic language of this Romantic poet, there is no better source. More readable than Frye. More profound than Hilton. Makes a great Christmas gift for any Blake fans on your list."
1,"nothing that I saw made me thinks "" wow, I want to knit that","I think that patterns from this book is not attractive, not in style and some are even ugly. Just ordinary, nothing special check, stripe, cable, some lace. Really nothing that I saw made me thinks "" wow, I want to knit that"". And some patterns are really ""cheating"". With the simplest stitch and special yarns like thick and thin or muti- colors. I meant who needs a pattern book to knit stuff like that. I think this book is only good for those who are new to scarves knitting. If not, you probably can come up with something better on your own. I recommand "" Vogue knitting accessorize"", more than 50 very lady like, classy, stylish patterns for scarves and hat, ponchos, mittens and a few formen's."
3,nostalgia trip,Bought this album strictly for nostalgia purposes. Great musicianship and love the memories associated with this one. I had this album on cassette and was glad to get a digital copy
1,Deliciously Bad - I cried with laughter.,"I decided to watch Scorcher with some friends last night. Little did I know that I was in for a treat. There are some disaster flicks that are tongue-in-cheek, but they have a good story line so they are watchable. Scorcher should go down in the annals of history as the worst disaster movie made.The acting is consistantly horrible, not because of the quality of the actors, but the script is like wading shoulder deep through molasses.The storyline is bad on so many levels that a thesis could be written on it. Rutger Hauer as the president??? What were they thinking? And please, at least give him a jacket that fit. Their command center is an abandoned soundstage?? Where were all the extras to help fill out the movie? You see the same people over and over. Also could you develop at least one character? Ah never mind!Scorcher should be made a requisite at all film schools as a good example of a bad example so others can learn what a good example is."
1,perhaps the worst disaster film ever made,"I love good disaster flicks, even the ridiculous ones, but this movie is downright dreadful."
5,I love to play Gospel Music,"(12-31-03)I am a huge fan of D.T Baldwin. Me and him have allot of things in common, because of music. At Galilee Missionary Baptist Church we play all of his songs like, God Is Good,Im Trusting in you lord, and Just Having a little church. I am A musicain at my church and I listen to your CD to get the sound and the beat alike.I know you from your sister on 90.9 FM.I hope you see this E-mail Rating, Because or church would like you to come on over"
2,VERY WEAK,"No blues here to speak of, I think Paul must have had the blues or lost them. There is very little blues here, so buyer beware this is for collectors only. But it is interesting to hear once or twice."
3,Vinyl to CD,"Like J. Klugman, I too had this album on vinyl, which is why I ordered the ""digitally remastered version"" of Blues Sonata.Sadly, the Wow is awful and the choice of material to fill the CD is disappointing, although I understand that there may be copyright restrictions on more appropriate tracks being utilised."
4,"A Fine, Tasteful Album","This should not be your first Charlie Byrd album. It doesn't have the wonderful Samba rhythms that make some of his best albums such joyous experiences. However, this is good jazz with a nice beat and some very hot guitar playing. I enjoyed it from the first time I heard it, but it definitely has grown on me after repeated listenings. All the songs have strong melodies and a nice, easy to find beat. You can hear each instrument very clearly, so that you can really enjoy the interplay between the guitar, bass, drums and piano. Some of the songs are romantic ballads, but most have enough energy to get you into a nice groove."
2,Interesting Rare Repertoire,"This very interesting composer can be had with all 3 symphonies he ever composed now, but unfortunately this 3rd one is underrehearsed and this spoils my joy.The music is epic and everyone who wants to think it's another Bruckner symphony could be right, but ofcourse it isn't.The performance is inadequate from the first bars on. Most of the wind instruments sound false or ARE false. The flow of the music isn't well observed (which has to be especially when everybody wants this one to sound like Bruckner), the conductor seems to know what he wants but the orchestra doesn't respond accordingly.Recording is thin and pumping up the volume made it unbearable to me. Violins sound like glass, timpani muddy and horns like cow bells.Still, a very interesting work which had to be done by a good German orchestra. Let's hope CPO does this job soon."
2,Not dishwasher safe???,"I just got this to use as an ice scoop at my office. We ran it through the dishwasher before using and the silver coating on the outside all came off and got all over someone's hands when they took it out. Maybe it was dumb to wash it, but I didn't see anything saying not to.... I think it may still be usable, but it took 15 minutes of washing to get all of the silver goop off."
4,"Close, but not perfect","I used to own an ice-scoop purchased from American Science and Surplus (A #0 Ice Scoop), but when Googling failed to find me an identical product (What exactly is a #0 ice scoop?!?), I guessed at sizes and purchased this one. As a bartender, I think I'd like a 16 oz scoop (although I know plenty of folk who think 8 oz scoops are perfect) with a larger handle. But as most scoop handles are undersized, I have trouble taking much off for that. And the 12 vs 16 oz scoop was a misjudgement on my part for my needs, not that of the seller. So 4 out of 5 stars it is.(Another point to consider when purchasing ice scoops is if the scoop is going to be used in a refrigerated bin or not. If not, consider buying a slotted scoop, so the melted ice can drain before adding to the drink. Or (as in my case) have a metal drill handy... But many/most bartenders don't worry about this detail...)"
5,EXCELLANT MOVIE.,"I'm from Yakima, WA. When this movie came out in 1959, I saw it in the old Capitol Theatre with my parents. The movie was outstanding and I wish to have a copy of it for my library and watch it again and again. It sure would be nice if it came out in the DVD format, also VHS, too."
5,The Hanging Tree,One of Gary Cooper's great final Westerans. Men search for gold in a mining camp. Town grows new wealth. Greed takes hold and mob rule takes over causing violence and destruction.
4,Hang Out With the Hanging Tree,Classic Gary Cooper western. Good entertainment. I had been waiting for a long time for this one to be released on DVD. There is also a great performance in this film from George C. Scott.
5,A Great California Story,"This is a fantastic film which happens in early Gold Rush days' has everything a masterpiece needs to be, butcan not be found in America!! Would be great on Blu Ray....Hello, Anybody HOME??"
3,the hanging tree dvd,"the hanging tree is a fairly good western. for those who realy know good westerns, iwould not recomend. The strongest part was the acting, especialy by Karl Maldin."
5,Fine Gary Cooper,This movie is near the top of my list for old westerns. Cooper plays a Doctor Joseph Frail and is a complex charactor that has a hidden past. A lot of people nature and mining camp hardships are brought out. A young George C. Scott plays a faith healer that pulls a cork. Karl Malden does a fine job in bringing out the worst of his charactor. The other actors did equally as well with their roles. My favorite scene is Doc treating a small girl and told the family can't pay for his services. He settles the bill for a kiss. Shot in Yakama Washington wine country during Gary Coopers final days. There are no indication of Cooper's health problems in the the movie. It is said that everyday on set he would walk down the trail to sign autographs for the fans. Marty Robbins does the Theme Song.
5,Will someone PLEASE release this on DVD???,"For the love of all that is holy, will someone please release this film on DVD? This was one of Gary Cooper's last films (his last Western), and one in which the viewer can see all those years of experience coming to the fore. This film is a masterpiece, and yet it has been neglected, while many of Cooper's lesser films have made the transition to DVD (admittedly, I'm grateful for ""The Real Glory"" and ""Springfield Rifle,"" but I need ""The Hanging Tree"")."
4,Grooming to win is a must have for any horse owner!,"Grooming to win is for any discipline, and any breed. I used it as a reference for getting back into the show ring. It's like having your own trainer with you all the time. I show Morgan and Quarterhorses and it covers everything from conditioning to getting those braids in right!DONT SHOW WITHOUT IT!"
5,Grooming to Win,This is an informative book. A U.S. Pony Club standard. A must have for all horse enthusiasts
2,An unfortunate 2nd rater compared to the 1st part!,"What the heck happened here? This 2nd lost earth saga simply kind of sucked! It didn't even seem like it was written by the same author. The storyline really slowed down in this installment and it just seemed like a filler for the next one to come in this trilogy. This alternate world and its characters was blah,blah,blah... It just didn't click together this time around - what happened? The 1st book was awesome from beginning to end and this one I couldn't wait to end. This alternate world was interesting but it was so rushed and cartoonish in some way. The bad guy Col. Thrush seems to know their every move and could have easily killed Kane and Baptiste now that he knows their plan, so why does he play so stupid? The storyline here needs some work and more thought. The Outlanders should try harder to stay online and not get off-line like this one did. Try it again fellas!!!"
4,Different,This Outlanders book was different from the first part of the trilogy but it still held my interest all the way through. It was just as action packed though there wasn't as much humor in it. I still enjoyed in and look forward to the next chapter in the Lost Earth saga.
1,Food Safety & Sanitation,"The book was useful but extremely out dated. With all of the new rules and regulations and certifications needed one may do better purchasing a newer more recent publication. Also Book was to ship with card package, card package was not present in shipment."
1,[is bad]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is the worst dvd ever made!!!!!!!when it said slipknot i thought they made a new dvd after there first one(welcome to the neighboorhood)so i put my money down and took it home and watched it. it was the most BORING dvd i could ever watch it had nothing to do with slipknot. all it showed of em is clips of em in concert. thats it.i was very mad and i threw it away at a dumpster where we go shoppping at.DONT BUY IT TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't buy this DVD,What ever you do don't buy this dvd!!! It is a pile of [dung] and dosent contain anything about slipknot. This is the biggest false advertisment I've seen in a while!!! I rate this a BIG FAT 0
1,Unbelievable,"I can't believe this DVD was produced and distributed. A Kenny Rogers fan from Singapore could make a better video than this in 10 minutes. This lame video just shows still images of the band, no interviews, just a few quotes. It shows a few still shots from live performances and talks to 2 or 3 Slipknot fans from Iowa. The fans don't even have an interesting story. Instead, they show random people boxing, they show a male and female acting out some sort of sword fight...for what reason is anyone's guess. This video should be received as a slap in the face to Slipknot fans everywhere. I don't know very much about the history of Slipknot, and I didn't learn one thing that I didn't already know from this video. You'd be better off buying the Hanson home video."
1,Is garbage,"Is an interview to the people of IOWA, but don't show music of slipknot and videos or anything that slipknot elaborate the only thing that shows is the group making signatures to people and don't thing that in this dvd they will show without masks, no they don't show up."
1,SLIPKNOT FANS: WATCH OUT - IT'S GARBAGE!,"All I can say is, do not buy this product. ... There is no music, concert footage nor any interviews with the band on this DVD. It is completely amature and doesn't give any kind of information of the band. All it has is some bad footage of some hoodlums and other freaks. ..."
1,I may never find a bag I like...,Floppy - will not hold it's shape or stand up. Bottom (probably a piece of cardboard) was crushed in shipping and will not lay flat. Handles are too long for me - I'm 6' tall and I have to lift the handles to head height to clear the side of the pickup bed.
3,Uconn sterling silver charm,This made a great gift for my boss. She's an orthodontist that graduated from Uconn. The only downfall is it could have been just a little bit bigger for her silver charm bracelet.
2,not consistent,"The first few selections are indeed reminiscent of Sinatra and his genre and are quite pleasant. All the instrumentations are good. But the remaining selections become unrecognizable and common, even blase, not enjoyable at all. He even seems to go off-key now and then as if his heart isn't in it. I am very disappointed in this CD and will probably only listen to it in the car now and then for the first 6 songs."
5,Enthralling Reading,I had a hard time putting my Kindle down while reading this book. The author encapsulates both the tactical situation for each encounter and the innermost thoughts of the ship's captain in a riveting narrative. This brings a wonderful richness of understanding on the part of the reader to what a captain of a destroyer in the Battle of the Atlantic went through during his most trying time - an attack on his convoy by U-Boats.
3,Easy Read,A good novel for those looking for a story of the pressure imposed on a commander of the lead ship guarding a convoy across the Atlantic during WWII.
2,Tedious,North Atlantic convoy duty should be a great subject for this fine author of the Hornblower series but sadly this novel fails. Tedious pop-up Bible verses and an obsession with the skippers toilet needs make this a tedious read.
1,"Disappointed In ""To Be Over""","I'm giving this CD only one star because I'm angry.This could have been a very beautiful instrumentalrendition of ""To Be Over"".However, Steve Howe cut out the main theme of the song!I'll use the lyrics to explain what he does. His arrangement goes from the phrase ""Childlike soul dreamer"" right to ""After all, your soul will still surrender"". Why? It's such a shame.Obviously, this disc deserves a few stars. But Howe shouldn't have cut out that part of ""To Be Over""."
4,Love This One,"A Big Hand For The Little LadyI really enjoyed this film. The first time I watched it I was gluedto the tv. I wanted to see how it would end. Superb!I have it on VHS, and may also buy the DVD."
4,Just can't wait,I have never seen this movie before but take it from a die hard poker fan as soon as this dvd hits the stores I'll be the first in line the reviews are amazing and the plot is interesting please rush this to dvd as soon as possible
4,"The classic card game "" Maverick""","The opening scene of yellow daisies, big mountains & blue sky is stunning. The card game a classic. The kid is a bit annoying, but then so are many child actors.Henry Fonda...perfect."
5,Classic Fonda,"When you receive this dvd, do yourself a favor and do notread anything about the film that is usually printed onthe dvd case. This movie must be watched without any hintas to what is going to happen. You will be very pleased andentertained, and surprised too. Fine acting by all playersis represented here."
4,Glad to have his in my collection,"My husband and I really appreciate the storytelling and character building in many older movies, and this was one that did a good job of both. Happy to have found another good story in our movie collection to rewatch."
2,"Overrated recording, overrated oratorio","Let me begin by saying that I'm not a fan of Theodora. I think Handel was at his best with the Messiah, Solomon, Semele, Serse... Here the music is oversimplified and somewhat lifeless. Unfortuantely, this recording makes things worse with its small and dramatically weak chorus. I love Handel's music, but this CD was a disappointment. It's like the Magic Flute, if you let it drag it gets boring, if you put your heart and soul into it, then it comes alive. What I did like about this recording was Hunt's angelic voice."
3,Darling Flip-flops,"These flip-flops are really cute and pretty much what I expected. For example, I didn't expect much cushion or support, so I wasn't too disappointed to find these lacking. Still, there are more cushiony options if that's what you need. (I find Reef sandals very cushiony by comparison.) Also, the thong part caused my feet to hurt between the toes, which never happens (for me) with Reef sandals. I wear these occasionally, but not for long stretches."
3,The Cold War analyzed by many,"I purchased this book for a history project, but did not realize it was a compilation of many different perspectives. I will read it later as I had to choose a specific area to review. The book came in excellent condition and arrived quickly. I look forward to the opportunity to read it thoroughly."
2,Much more propaganda than scholarship!,"We used this book as a texbook in an adult education course. Almost everyone in our class (myself included), most of whom are quite liberal, were appalled by the overall lack of objectivity, the repeated assertions that throughout history the major cause of woes in the world has been American policy. Rather than an objective discussion of the consequences of cold war triumphalism (which is real and has had negative consequences), most of the papers attempt to depict the Cold War as a result of American foreign policy, without much discussion of the very real dangers that the Soviet Union posed to the Western world."
1,"Shrecker, the fraud, strikes again","Ellen Schrecker is a committed Communist and revisionist historian. No amount of evidence from Soviet archives open since 1991 will dissuade her from her position that it is the free nations and peoples of the world that caused the cold war, rather than the aggressive and murdering nations that she loves so and whose passing she laments.Ellen Shrecker is part of the politburo of the American historians that are trying to rewrite history. It won't work. The facts are out and she is swimming against a flood of paper that give the lie to her beliefs. If you REALLY want to understand where things stand, read David Horwitz, Ron Radosh, John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr."
4,Killer B's and Twilley to Boot,"For fans of Badfinger and Big Star, not to mention Dwight Twilley, with whom Brandon and the Scrappers sometimes play in hometown Tulsa clubs, this record will delight. Besides several top-notch originals that would have been at home on the late 60's, early '70s charts, their cover versions of songs by Twilley and T. Rex are outstanding, flattering to the originals without being slavishly derivative. If you like this record, don't miss their brand new cd ""Pet Food,"" not as cleverly named but even better musically."
4,"Great movie, needs video work though.",The whites wash into each other more than they should if they had taken their time and done a proper job editing. Warren Miller rules though!
4,"dynasty, good but not great",Dynasty has lots of big mountain skiing and great photography. But Jonny Moseley is not the narrator Warren Miller is.
2,Repititous. Complex charts for simple concepts.,I can't really recommend this book. Like many non-fiction books it's very repititious and doesn't really offer insight. Never quite gets to the crux of the matter. He puts together very complex charts for simple concepts that did nothing but fill pages. I found the techniques so commonplace as to not be useful.
5,Great at Identifying Problems,"This book has easily helped me to identify where some of my anger comes from. Dr. Defoore uses stories and real-life examples to help readers understand what it is they are going through. I never would have thought of my anger as grief. I lost a great friendship to a narcissistic and controlling individual, and didn't realize that my anger at that person was grief for the lost relationship until I read this book. I keep it by my side when I am feeling angry and consult it many times to make sure I am not harming myself or others around me more by my actions.Defoore is straight-forward and honest. He says in the beginning that a mere book will not fix the problems of anger. He suggests that the reader go to counseling along with reading his book. It is great advice. This is definitely a great read, one that does not bash on one's beliefs or their nature. A great find and one that I will keep by my side for many years to come."
4,"Nice Music, but...","I like the music here. Good group with good taste in songs.But beware...when several songs are listed on one track, ... you get only pieces of each song. There is a lot of this on this disk, so you get about three songs and a bunch of brief previews. Sort of like paying to go to a movie and getting a 30-minute short and 90 minutes of coming attractions."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I purchased one of these last year, and what a MAJOR waste of my money! The very next day after using this ""button"" the ""seal"" had broken & the bags were full of air. Waste of my time & money!"
3,plastic is kind of cheap,"Niffty iteam, but it's made of really cheap lastic, the hinge broke the first day I used it. Can be kind of hard to sperate from the bag at the end of the process, but over all I'd say its a half decent product. You might need to experiment a little to find a good plastic bag. I liked using clear kitch can liners, but to 50 gallon bag is too big for the button."
1,HUGE waste of money,I wish I would have read these reviews before I bought this item. It simply doesn't work. Yes it takes air out of the bag but it doesn't stay sealed for more than an hour. I went out and bought commercial grade clear bags and it still wouldn't stay sealed. Don't bother with this its hugely overpriced for something that does not work!!!!!
2,NO BLUES HERE,If your expecting blues don't get this one or Put It In Your Ear. Of course this like always is just my opinion.
1,Scam!,This is absolutely terrible! East West is one of my favorite Paul Butterfield albums (actually I like all 3 of them) and was surprised to find an album I'd never heard of. This album is a bunch of 70's disco songs with Paul Butterfield listed as doing back up vocals. Must have sold the rights to use his name. Save your money. I paid [...] which is [...] too much.
2,Pretty but not so functional,I got this bag 8 months ago when my 3 daughter was born. It is a super cute bag but very stiff. It didn't hold as much as I had hoped. The bag is also starting to come apart where the straps attach to the bag itself. I expected a lot more for the money. All the reviews I read shared such praise about the bag but I would not recommend it nor buy another one. Only 8 months old and I already have to buy a new one. I cost me about $12 a month for this bag. I am not rough on bags in particular either. I just don't think this bags is worth the $100 price tag.....
5,Chic diaper bag,"I love this bag! I bought it because this is my 4th child but 1st boy and since my other kids are older and I haven't needed a diaper bag for a few years I wanted something that was functional but didn't look like a diaper bag. This totally fits the bill, it has enough space for everything, but still looks great. I love the accessory bags the smallest one holds my cc and id and I can grab just that if I'm going somewhere w/out the baby. Also, I spilled coffee on it last week and it wiped right off w/out a problem. Would defintely recommend to the on the go mom who still wants to stay in style!"
5,I get so many compliments!,"This bag has been wonderful. It's black, so it never shows that milk leaks into it from bottles. It's stylish, so people are always asking me where I got it. AND it's functional. Oh, and it works for both a baby boy or girl because the blue is very gender neutral. A perfect diaper bag!"
3,I really wanted to love it,"I really wanted to love this bag b/c it really looks like a classy tote rather than a typical diaper bag but honestly, I was disappointed by the color; it's aqua not baby blue so the color combination wasn't what I expected. The tote is also pretty big, I'm only 5 foot 3 so it was a bit awkward to carry- in the end, I returned it."
5,The perfect gift.....,This was purchased for my first grandbaby.....a little 'princess'! This is the bag my daughter in love wanted and it was the perfect gift.....great quality and so feminine. The perfect set for a 'princess'! Very happy with the purchase .... would recommend it to my friends....
3,fashionable but not that functionable,If you want a bag that's fashionable this one is. BUT it doesn't hold a lot and it doesn't fit hanging on my Graco strollers and when you put it under the stroller everything falls out. Hard to organize everything you need. I ended up buying a backback it's comfortable fits everything I need and I don't have to worry about things falling out.
4,Stephen Coonts on the Moon!,"I never thought the author of ""Flight of the Intruder"" would ever take me as far as the moon. This book was quite the adventure, and very believable with where it goes.While the first book had that ""initial discovery"" feel about the whole saucer, the sequel doesn't quite hold up. I was a little concerned because now all the main characters aren't just geniuses, they're *rich* geniuses! How was I going to relate to any of these guys?!Any review on Amazon will tell you the story. I just wanted to input that Coonts obviously had a blast writing these two books and it shows. His blatant pokes at the president are laugh-out-loud hilarious...by far the best scenes in the entire book!Enjoy!"
2,Unbelievably... unbelievable,"I haven't read the first Saucer, so perhaps I'm missing something here, but this attempt by Stephen Coonts to write science fiction is actually a return to the past... pulp science fiction of the fifties. I mean, a hero named Rip Cantrell? Women heroes and villains that are drop dead gorgeous (of course). Flying saucers that a neophyte without flying experience can just pop in and fly to the moon?Bad guys think Earth needs saved blah blah put secret weapon on moon blah blah Rip to the rescue with fighter pilot Charley Pine blah blah bad guy wants revenge blah blah.This is a light read. Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed. Expect much, and you won't finish it. HOWEVER... I do think I'll track down the first novel, Saucer. What I won't be looking for is any third novel in this series."
3,The book was exciting but the author needed to pick up the pace.,Some of the action sequences could have been shortened without losing any effect. The saucer battle lasted way too long.
2,Book Vs. BookOnCD,"Saucer: The Conquest, as a BookOnCD, is heavily abridged and loses much of the details and plot of the book. If you're going to spend money on this, get the paperback as well and decide if the BookOnCD is worth keeping. If someone were to do an Unabridged version, get it! Otherwise, just get the book rather than the BookOnCD."
5,Her songs are like poetry put to music!!!,Her music can touch your heart and your funny bone. Spiritually moving. Definitely an experience for the soul.
3,"I like Patty, but this album didnt convince me..","I heard ""Good Thing"" on the Random Hearts soundtrack which immediately got me interested me in hearing more of Patty Larkin's work. I bought this CD and Good Thing, although different from the Random Hearts soundtrack, is very good. She is indeed a wonderful guitar player and singer, but her original material seems weak - I think only hard core folk music fans would appreciate this album - she would benefit from better material - especially songwriting that would show off the strong emotion and breadth of her singing and playing - she has the skills but she needs better songs!"
4,Pleasantly refreshing!,"I loved this cd,""Good Thing"" was my favorite song because they played it as Stephan and Laura's love song on the soap opera ""General Hospital"" and it was just so good. The words,music and voice of the artist was wonderful. I love her style and sound. Pick up this disc, you'll be very happy you did!"
2,i don't know,I got it thought it would be good it is hard to keep it in one spot for me anyway i might be doing it wrong but i do know i did not like the base on the thing it is a little flimsy i was kind of afraid it might not keep it from going to far in like i said didn't like should have spent the money on something else
4,"Kids love the songs, hate the talk",My daughter loves anything wiggles and this CD is no exception. It has her favorite Hot potatoe. The only negative is there is a lot of talking which interfers with the flow of the CD and irritates her. It just takes too long to get to the actual songs but once the song starts she is happy again.
5,Great live children's music,"This is a great disc. The Wiggles are uplifting and entertaining without being condescending. All of their classics are on here, so for the price you can't beat it. It's a nice cd to play during playtime at home or in the car when running long errands."
4,A cheesey but fun surf nostalgium,"An homage of sorts to the royal sport of the Hawai'ian kings, _Surf Madness_ revisits ""surfing oldies"" in Hapa's distinctive half-Hawai'ian, half-Mainland style. A fun album for a party, lu'au, or for any bro."
1,Not my cup of tea...,"I LOVE the first Hapa CD -- melodic acoustic guitar music. They were going for something different with this, though -- the ""surf sound"" of electric guitar and more mainstream rock and roll mainland music. I bought it, I get it, I just don't like it as much as everything else from Hapa."
4,Different but fun - if you like surf music,"If you're looking for more music like Hapa's original release, try their CD ""In the Name of Love"" or Barry Flanagan's ""Instrumental Peace"" (absolutely wonderful). They had some fun on this one, playing/writing some surf music and breaking the mold a bit. They did however throw in two songs from their other CDs that are more like their other contemporary Hawaiian music. If you're willing to break the mold yourself, and do a little toe tapping, give it a try."
3,Myositis Patients Beware!,"As a person diagnosed with Signal Recognition Particle Antibody Syndrome, a very rare and agressive type of Polymyositis, I feel compelled to ""warn"" Myositis patients about this book. Yes, it does make patients realize others are experiencing the samedebililitating symptoms you are; however, I found this book to be VERY NEGATIVE. It doesn't list the positive aspects of this disease today--there is hope with ongoing research; knowledgeable specialists; medicines available to relieve symptoms; and effective therapies. I KNOW personally--a positive attitude is essential in successfully dealing with this difficult illness."
3,Small Paperback,The book is fine but please buy the cheapest used one you can find. It is not worth the higher prices that are being asked. This is a collection of short stories by people who have the disease and how it has changed their life. The book is 158 pages. I bought used and am grateful I did.
2,testimonials from sufferers,"This book is only testimonials from other sufferers. It will give you ""ah hah"" moments to let you know you are not alone with this affliction, but it doesn't really tell you anything to help your situation."
5,Coping with a Myositis Disease,The Coping with Myositis disease is a great book & very informative. I had ordered this book for myself about a year or more ago & this one I bought for a friend. She was also exited about it. It's almot imposible to find information about Inclusion Body Myositis.The quick delivery was amazing & especially around the holidays. Thank you very much for making this available.
4,Doing the job...,"This bin was pretty easy to put together, and like the other reviews say, it has a heavy lid that doesn't blow off. So far, I've gotten a decent amount of compost from the bin.If there are any drawbacks, they are: 1) the bottom of each side bulges out a bit from the pressure of the material compacted down there. I turn the material, but it's hard to get down there sometimes. 2) I have the optional rodent screen (a heavy gauge mesh screen placed at the bottom before filling), but I still have mice getting in and eating things. Pretty frustrating. 3) The sliding door at the bottom works, but compost/debris gets caught in the tracks as you close it, making it a bit of a game getting it completely closed.All these aside, I still like the unit, and think it is worth the price -- it actually does compost pretty well and keeps the right amount of moisture in there for activity."
4,Good Product,"Easy to assemble, excellent quality and ease of use, but, my compost did not break down very much over the fall and winter. I used leaves, dead plants, fruits, vegetables, egg shells and coffee grinds. Maybe I was missing ingredients."
3,How do you spell v...e...r...b...o...s...e?,"I have been looking forward to reading a bio of the great economist, philosopher and trader and bought this book after seeing many positive comments. Sorry to say, I got bogged down very quickly. The author never misses a chance to blow up to 2 pages what could have been said in a single paragraph. The book is a like sea-going ship so overgrown with barnacles that it can no longer move forward."
3,Not that big a deal,"I have had this pen for a few hours, and these are my impressions.This pen is what the description says it is - but it is not that big a deal. It does not write especially well. I have Pilot G-2 that writes better than this Lamy Swift, and I can get a dozen of them for $13 based on today's price on Amazon[..]The Lamy Swift is surprisingly lite. No heft whatsoever. I estimate it is only a few grams heavier than my normal Pilot G-2s.This pen does look nice, but their are nicer looking pens for less money.Overall, I would not buy this pen again."
3,Clairrsa Explains It All - Dating,"This VHS tape contains 2 complete episodes from the hit Nickelodeon TV series ""Clarissa Explains It All"" plus osme bouns features as well. The episodes included are as follows:""Blind Date"" [Season 3, episode #13 - originally aired February 27, 1993]Synopsis: Sam sets himself and Clarissa on a double blind date, and Clarissa obsesses over what could happen on the date.""A Little Romance"" [Season 4, episode #08 - originally aired August 14, 1993]Synopsis: Sam realizes that Clarissa is the perfect girl for him after too many bad dates.There are also exclusive bonus features including Clarisa's dating tips and never revealed before dating disasters!"
5,Suave sophisticated Chopin,"I've long enjoyed the music of Chopin and have listened to many interpreters. I would count Frederic Chiu among the best. His playing is crisp and clean, but with a lovely sense of lyricism and flair for nuance. The Op. 10 etudes are gorgeous and sound new. It's a treat to find the rondos together and performed so exquisitely. I highly recommend his latest recording, Chopin's Complete Mazurkas on Harmonia Mundi, as well. Both CD's offer brilliant piano sound."
3,These don't fit all cans,"I was SO hoping that these lids would fit Pepsi, Coke and off-brand soda cans but they don't. :'("
5,Great product!,The can top cover is really wonderful! It keeps your can of coke fresh and from spilling.
1,does not fit the dr. pepper cans in 2008,"I drink a lot of can dr. peppers, well sip on them. Was very unhappy when they came in and did not fit onto my dr. pepper. So if you drink dr. pepper, I would not recommend these lids or you will be disappointed."
2,I asked myself,"Why I bought this one. Just couldn't get into it, I didn't get lost in the music. There wasn't even one track that I had to listen to over and over again."
5,Departure From the Expected...So Hot,"I have nearly everything Migs has released and this is one of the funkiest, ass-shaking mixes I've got recently. Not so deep in what you'd expect but change is good and it's OUTSTANDING!! This is turning into a favorite of mine since the Nude Dimensions Vol 1 disc."
5,Got house?,This a great CD that you can listen to over and over again. It's chill yet it still can get you excited while driving in the bay area traffic!
2,BORING ELECTRONIC DRUM BEATS,"I really like some of Migs' earlier stuff so, I was excited when I picked this up. Man, I just don't see what's so interesting, or what those that gave this 5 stars see, in hearing the same boring electronic drum beat go on throughout 4, 5 or, 6 cuts! Just when you think it's about to stop it picks up again. I find myself waiting for to be over, or wishing I could lift it off the recording so I could listen to the music behind it. Some of Migs' stuff sits in my player for weeks. I listen to it over and over and, never get bored. With this CD, I wish I could return it."
1,TOTAL SCAM,This is NOT a Gerber knife. A complete fraud. The brand is Superknife which you can look on the internet. Do NOT buy thinking you will receive a Gerber knife.
4,Great for singers!,"This is a great cd for up and coming singers. It lets you add your voice to todays most popular hits, and it's also great for parties!"
4,Dark and Disturbing Fun,"The Dark Lord is a great entry into the world of serial fiction. Dr. Rae, who works at UC Berkley, and has a painful illness stumbles across a mysterious box while traveling through Egypt. With trouble following her, Rae needs to uncover the mystery before it buries her.The Dark Lord is a great gothic read with nuanced characters and a 'dark' premise. For those who enjoy a touch of romance with their horror this is a fantastic book."
4,Very Interesting Story Line,I really enjoyed this book. I think the story concept was very cool though half way through I already knew who the good guy was and who the bad guy was. I could tell where the author tried to make it so it was not so obvious but over all it is a very enjoyable read. She really let you get to know the characters; past and present. I would definitely recoment this as a good read. I got through it in a matter of days. : ))
1,"Terrible, Awful, Boring Book","This book was horrible. It was slow and Boring and not terribly imaginative. What kind of a name is Fae Rae. Anywho, whenever the Author had a chance to infuse some steamy romance she came up short. Michael started off sounding like the typical goodlooking, tortured and sexy hero but ended up boring and a sucker. Fae Rae was an anorexic-never-learned-when-to-enjoy- yourself bore. I could not believe she fell for the Dark Lord. Who, by the way sounded unappealing and too darned thin to be a sexy hero. Also, he had absolutely NO REAL powers. I was never scared or thrilled. I have this hardcover for sell on Amazon. This book had no real action and you will literally hate Fae's sister Angie. What a sniveling coward."
2,Way overrated,"Please, lets be honest I wanted to like this book. I couldn't. It was way to long, confusing and annoying. The male lead was a whiner, the female lead was so pathetic. The only really interesting person was the demon. Skip this one."
5,Love it! So soft and flexible,"I was at first unhappy because I thought I go the wrong color, but I made a mistake and didn't press the brown key. Now I want it in all colors. It's very trendy (take off straps if you want) and it's also very flexible.I have stuffed a 700 page book into the side pocket and still had room for the laptop, the cord and my cell phone.And it's washable. I will never own a regular laptop bag again."
2,Built NY Bags are very Poor Quality,"Purchased two of these bags for my wife at Christmas. She used one of the bags for about 3 weeks befor the pocket snap broke off. Very cheap aluminum snap that breaks very easy. The shoulder strap end ring that is connected to the bag is already lose and ready to come off. These bags look great and my wife and her friends loved them, but they are so cheaply made that they won't last long. Fair Warning"
4,"Lovely, functional laptop bag.","I actually saw this bag in the Apple store for $69.99, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for $41.00! The brown color is complemented by the beautiful minty-aqua green lining and it fits my Macbook Pro perfectly. Theres a bit of a bulge, but the power cord does fit into the outer pocket. I plan on keeping a pair of headphones, my school planner and an iPod cord in there as well.My only complaint is that the shoulder strap and zipper pull are black, which shows a little bit of oversight design wise. I'm a design major, so all the details count to me. Luckily, my camera bag is brown, so I stole the strap from it.Also, its washable, which is a huge plus. I'm really picky about my things, but I highly reccommend this stylish bag as an alternative to a boring black one. I'll never have any mix-ups with other peoples' laptop bags!"
4,Nice simple case,"I wanted a small lightweight ""sleeve"" to carry around my MacBook but it needed to have handles which ruled out most of the products out there. This case is nice and compact though a little tall for the widescreen Macbook. It also has a nice small document pocket in front that you can carry a few papers in or stuff in a charger. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this case, just wish it fit my computer a little more snugly (but since its not computer specific, can't really complain much about that)."
1,Don't Buy It,"The graphics are fair for a game of this type but the game play is horrible. This schould be a beta, not the final release. some controls are not documented. You can not control the rate of time."
3,"Zenith 25"" TV/VCR","We bought this TV for our bedroom. The picture & sound were fine. We ended up returning it because of a bothersome buzz that occurred when the volume was low. It would be fine in a noisy family room, but not in a quiet bedroom."
4,The Sound I've Missed!,"It's getting better each day for we lovers of what the word Rock really stands for. After a decade of mumbling or screaming singers and so-called guitarists who took pride in being unable to play their instruments, we now have great bands like Tokyo Dragons coming to re-kindle our love of music and to save us from having to desperately trawl through obscure '60's and '70's lost bands; hoping to find a lost gem of real rock we haven't heard or have in our collections.Tokyo Dragons, you are our salvation! Keep it coming!"
4,They gitter dun,"Yessireebob they sure do, T-Drags get it going with GIVE ME THE FEAR, and album that shines with groovy, psychadelic tones. I have not heard a band this good since I used to put on the old BTO vinyls I had years ago. Seriously, they are worth checking out so do not delay and go git sum!!"
1,Where are the brook trout,"I had expected to see brook trout footage but I onlyspotted other trout species.I was rather disturbing to see how the guy in the videoconstantly dropped every trout he caught, maybe heshould use a net for a change.The fact that this title was recorded on a RW DVD shouldring a bell, terrible soundtrack too.Maybe I am just too spoiled after seeing those excellent DVD titlesfrom Oliver Edwards essentials skills that are available in the UK.This was a title that ended in the trashcan after one view,not recommended at all."
5,Masterpiece - No - Entertaining - Yes - Why else watch,"Big Shot's Funeral - Yes the story line is unbelievable - And no it is not the type of film that would win awards - But yes it entertaining and that is what it should be. Of course if you are of Chinese culture you may would pick-up more of the inside jokes, but if you have seen many other Chinese language films you know when the names Li Gong and Ziyi Zhang are dropped for fun. When you want to take a break from the great Chinese films of directors Wong-kar-wai, Yimou Zhang, Ang Lee than this is a fun film to see. Another good/fun film from this director (Xiaogang Feng) is ""A World Without Thieves"". If you are not used to film with subtitles than this may be a good film to start with as there is some spoken English (the Amazon listing of Chinese and French is in error by not including English). Buy it cheap -you won't regret it."
2,da man,"masterpeace!!!a dark comedy about one of the common fantasieswho heaven't dream about your own funeral?well donald sutherland is a movie director,he directs his own funerali found the movie really funny"
5,Loved it!,I ordered this CD for my husband and he loved it! He loves listening to it. I even recognized a couple of songs.
1,"Run, run far away!","Another guy trying to make a buck by having a blog. Actually, another guy trying to take your money, because he has a blog. He probably wrote the 5 star reviews for the book. This book is not researched based, his claims are not research based. Basically seems like he went on a diet and is trying to package and sell his experience. Sound more like Jimmy Moore use to fill his time with eating, and now he fills his time with blogging and trying to be relevant. I guess it's better then killing himself with food. I'm not donating to his cause though. He should get a real job."
1,Don't waste your money...,"...on this book. If you have ever read a diet success story in a magazine or seen one on Oprah, you have basically read this book. The only difference is the overbearing conceit and the cutsy-poo writing style will make you cringe. Yeah, he lost weight. Yeah, low carb works; I follow the lifestyle myself and know a thing or two about it. As much, in fact, as Mr. Moore does; I can read, too. There is nothing new here except the fact that Mr. Moore is a legend in his own mind."
2,The Jared of Low Carb...,"""[This] man in the suit has just bought a new car with the profit he's made on your dreams""A little less angst and less pride and this author may gain worldy respect. Mr. Moore sort of reminds me of Bill O'Reilly."
5,Jimmy is the real deal!,I've been there before myself and this is the book I wish I had written. This is the biggest life changing experience a person can have especially when you consider it is a life saving experience.
5,Jimmy has spunk!,"While I haven't read his book yet, I've been following his blog since he started it last Spring. If the writing in the book is anything like the blog, well, you're in for a ride! Jimmy does not hold back when he talks about his own experiences or reports on others. While some may not like this style, I find the passion with which Jimmy writes a nice change from the sometimes dry writing of other authors. I sometimes think of him as a low-carb radio show host or even as a Atkins step-son. While some may view his approach as ""over the top"" in some ways, the one thing it certainly is NOT is ""boring""!"
2,"Stop, Stop, Stop.","Ahem. I have read these reviews and I have read JM's blog and book (sort of, not worth finishing), unlike most reviewers here.Sorry, I was bored. Just another book I will not finish reading. I suppose, I am getting old, and I prefer excitement. Been there, done that twice.The only excitement surrounding this book appears to be the balloons on the cover and the [biased] reviews.Allstar ratings...hmmm, the stars may as well be RED FLAGS. Most even admitted to not reading the book. If my book (The Life of a Princess), sustained poor rankings, I'd ask my cronies to write stellar reviews too. It works both ways, I reckon.Yet another author, yet another diet. Everyone is a dietician today?, yet the world grows bigger. Ayi, yi, yi. Who to trust these days? Not Mr. Moore I suspect. Here today, gone tomorrow.God Bless,GHWBDid you know? Dietitian is spelled 2 ways."
5,This guy knows his stuff about how to do low carb!,"While low carb as an industry might be bankrupt, Jimmy Moore shows in his book that its ideas definitely have merit. As a fellow over 200 pound ""loser"" due to Atkins, his words echoed almost all my thoughts as the scale dropped lower and lower. If you listen to him and his wisdom, you WILL be successful. It is one man's perspective on a much attacked subject, but if you want to know what low carbers are thinking and how to refute the naysayers, this book is it. Next to Dr Atkins New Diet Revolution (2002), this book is definitely on my recommendation list."
5,If you love the Far East you must see this,A well done description of HK but you will need far more than three days because you will love the place even if you travel on a tight budget.
5,Lives up to my expectations,"Willis is my favorite Pietasters album, and this one is almost as good in my opinion. It's definitely going to grow on me as I listen to it. I was hoping for more dark songs like Stone Feeling and Crime, but this album is catchy and different from other albums (of course) and I like it. The Pietaster really diversify and it makes for great music."
3,It is what it is...,"Works as described. It is a nice little gadget to have. It works, it will leak a bit but, you can tell when you look at it that will. In a pinch, it works."
5,No RV water here...Not with the bandit.,I put a wingnut style hose clamp on my bandit and can get water anywhere now....SWEET. It's a must have if you camp on the fly and get water wherever you can.
2,Comes apart to easy,"In theory this thing would work. However, everytime I have tried to use it the thing blows apart. Had to add a couple of hose clamps just to keep the thing together under any sort of pressure. So far have not had a chance to use it since the addition of the clamps."
1,did i really buy this?,"If you love slapstick comedy- this 'adapter' is for you! No end to the humor as you try and try again to thread the rubber end on 'properly' so it doesn't spray in every direction. If it's not a hot day, make sure you have your partner at the adapter end while you man the spigot because somebody is going to get REALLY wet! The hilarity and screaming (AHGGGHH! TURN IT OFF! NO! TURN IT ON!!!)are LOADS of fun- but NOTHING compares to the surprise you'll get if you actually thread a spray nozzle onto the brass threads of the adapter and turn on the hose! LIFT-OFF! I think ours went airborne for a solid 7 seconds!I give this product 1 star for it's advertised use- but 10 out of 10 as a redneck water park event!!!!Good times..."
2,good idea. bad workmanship.,"i love that its bamboo. i love that its pretty. i dont love that the cutting board comes apart after using it sparingly for about a year.for the price, its a total disappointment.the darker bamboo and the lighter colored bamboo have separated, after using this chopping board very sparingly over the past year.i only cleaned it gently, rinsing it quickly. using small amounts of soap. i never soaked it or submerged it. it should have never come apart.BAD WORKMANSHIP!from now on, i will only purchase cutting boards made of a single piece of wood or bamboo."
3,A good rock record,"I tend to think people expect too much out of music sometimes. I saw these guys live last night and they rocked. I bougt the cd at the show and talked to roman for a couple minutes about stuff in general. This group isn't the flamming lips but I like what they do. they remind me of a cross between Fugazi, The Rolling stones and a little Pixies (mostly the lead guitar). If you want to buy a cd that sounds great in a car stereo going down the highway then buy this record. If you're looking for some sonic masterpiece go buy a built to spill cd. this is good just not spectacular. There's something to be said for simplicity I think."
4,OK Jim DeRogatis...........,"OK Mr. Fuchs, it's been 20 years since the Gang of 4 put out a good album, so why knock this? I'm too old to complain about stuff I used to listen to. I like this AND I bought the vinyl so I supported them. I like this and YES it reminds me of the Clash and Gang of 4, but who cares? If I want weird, I'll listen to my Arthur Doyle free jazz albums."
4,great rock stuff,"this album is great if you appreciate late 70's, early 80's punk / alternative music. infused with some awesome funky bass playing. now only if they could put out another great album like this, and drop the keyboards and percussionist..."
4,Good Danceable Stuff,"This is one of those albums that gradually works its way into your regular listening rotation, both in your head and in your stereo. The first song is unforgettable from the first listen; what follows is rock and roll with a mellow dub-ish sound thrown in--you can't help but nod your head and even shake your hips. I'm not a big fan of dub bands, reggae, ska, or the clash, but I love this stuff. Its fast paced, upbeat, and everything that popular indie/emo music is not today. This is just a band who knows how to get people moving, and I don't see anything wrong with that."
1,not as good as garden variety,romans great but only with his last band garden variety. that band was incredible in every way. this new bands good but way way too close to its influences..too bad gv is gone. its a shame.
2,earnest but we already have Gang of Four CDs,"I think the band is competent and on the right track and they most certainly borrow from a great band but they need to find their own voice.I guess it's the same way I feel about Seattle's Turn Ons - why would you listen to that when there are at least 50 great albums worth of T. Rex and Bowie (who wrote way better songs!)When I hear this it makes me want to listen to the later Gang of Four CDs that weren't as good as those first two classics.I don't mean to harsh on these guys, I'm sure they are a blast live and they could get interesting at some point..."
1,nothing to this,"The few lyrics are repeated over and over again, and the word ""party"" is pronounced irritatingly ""po-tee"" to rhyme with ""hottie"" (the title word of the song). Very amaturish. Maybe O.K. for ""tweens"". Not for anyone over 13."
4,Hot Song,"Another in a long line of teen pop sirens, Ashley Ballard has released what is one of the better teen pop singles in recent memory. The music and lyrics are a cut above the average pop record, and her voice is pretty decent, if somewhat enhanced. If she can carry an album's worth of equally catchy material, we may be hearing more from this girl."
2,"Cute, but not worth it.","This is a nice idea, but well, it just doesn't work- quite a few of the recipes feature odd items or measurements not used in the U.S. (not quite sure where some were from??), editing is nice- but the cliques seem to fly a bit heavily. I think I would rather buy a good cookbook from a gay chef (I know, who would have thought..) than waste my time with this one...If you need ideas THIS bad, go surf for them..."
5,Great Product,"I bought these several months ago to vent my truck during the hot summer, but protect it from prying eyes and wet weather. It fits perfectly and works perfectly. Only time will tell on the durability, but so far, so good."
2,Beach Audio seller listing-LISTING ERROR,"Wrong item sent by Beach Audio seller-DVD-R X16 discs received. Seller contacted, agreed they made ERROR IN LISTING of DVD-R 8X recordable discs. Item they sent was DVD-R 16X recordable discs-the only ones in their stock. (Only my ordered DVD-R 8X record/play on my Sony DVD recorder/player.) Beach Audio has good customer service, and sent me a pre-paid shipping label to return the incorrect merchandise in the next week-(Due to their listing error.) When the money was finally refunded upon their receipt of the returned merchandise, I had to order the correct discs from another seller, and also await their arrival. So-4 weeks passed without usable discs."
5,Excellent Concert,"A truly fantastic concert caught on tape. Harry sings with his big band in a very entertaining show, with a couple songs that he has never released on any albums. This is the best of his concert on tape. I highly recommend it! (I own it on Laser Disc)."
4,canadian gem,"Maelstrom earned best film, best director, and best actress in canada for good reason. Highly imaginative and original, this is a story about life and death. A story about a young woman told by a 'cronenbergesque' fish on a chopping block."
4,The meaning of Life,"This is probably one of the more original films I've seen in a long while. The director has clearly drawn influence from the Blue White Red trilogy, but that don't take away it's originality or it's power.It's about abortion, death, love, philosophy, and a talking fish. Go figure, one of the greatest films of the year."
4,trailer belly repair,Product worked exelent to repair of black under belly of 5 th wheel which had gotten torn . Just make sure you clean any dirt off edges to be bonded and will make a nice repair.
4,Only film that ever made me run for the emergency exit!,"The only film that ever caused me to run out of the emergency exit before it was over! I am very resistent to blood and guts, most violence, etc., but this one really got to me. I am looking forward to seeing the DVD and (hopefully not) re-living the emotion. An excellent, very disturbing commentary on Hollywood."
5,Chaos,"I had seen this movie many years ago and it had made a definite impression. Watching it again was enjoyable, but also very uncomfortable. Can't imagine what was going on in my life the first viewing, but something that mad me very sad. The movie, of course, if not very cheery either."
3,"Great performances, okay movie...","The nuanced performances of Sutherland, Meredith, Black -- and an exceptional little Jackie Haley as an androgynous child star -- are the true reasons to invest your time in this classic. Too little story to justify its length of 2hrs and 24mins, but it looks great, has stellar moments, captures the period of 1930's Hollywood most extraordinarily, and has an almost surreal and disturbing conclusion that will make you glad you labored-through to it. I too likened it to ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" - though I found TSHDT? an overall much more satisfying cinematic experience."
3,Day of the Decadent,"I would have to say that ""The Day of the Locust"" is a well-crafted film about the denizens who occupy the periphery of Hollywood. That said, these individuals are so shallow and decadent that it does not make for a pleasurable viewing experience. About the only redeeming character in the film is an ill-fated one named Homer Simpson played by Donald Sutherland. Your heart truly breaks for him. Alot of the other reviews of this film applaud this film for daring to take it's audience into such a dark area. I'd just as soon not visit such a place."
3,hollywood babylon redux redux redux ...,"it takes longer to watch this movie based on nathaneal wests short story than it takes to read the source material. this tale has been told too many times, yet filmmakers continue to think that the seedy side of hollywood is as fascinating to us as it is to them. well, its not. that said, there ARE terrific performances to be found here: donald sutherland, burgess meredith, and others, tho william atherton is his usually vapid self in the central role. im glad i saw it, but if i ever want to pay a return trip, i will visit the library and mr wests tome."
3,Johnghawk,"The book is way to technical to be a good student reference material andI was hoping for more from the author. Since the FAA has done away with ultralight instructors I was looking for a good reference material to help student ultralight pilots.. Bottom line, this is not the one."
4,PRECIOUS GEMS,"Want to make love to you all night long or how about downtown. These are some of the few cuts on a cassete I own of Lillo,s in the late 80,s station in germany. In the same mode as Kashif, this artist smooth silky voice is one you must hear. A must have if you enjoy really soulful R/B cuts. This artist never got the props he deserve and most of his songs are truly precious gems"
4,He shoulda/coulda been a contender!,"This protege of Melba Moore had a pretty good run with ""Good Girl'' and a few others back in the early 1980s before joining the legion of early- to mid-1980s R&B vocalist who came, saw and, unfortunately got conquered by the incredible popularity of Luther Vandross and rapidly shifting musical tastes. Thank goodness this re-release gives us another shot at a clear, sweet voice that disappeared off the airwaves and record shelves all too soon."
3,Lillo Thomas Wanted,"Hey everyone, I am in desperate need of this cd and I was wondering if someone would be so kind to burn my a copy...I live in Atlanta and can't seem to find it....Please help my email address is taimaw2002@yahooThanks in Advance"
2,REJECT THIS,"Anything having to do with Ron Wyatt, Bob Cornuke, Michael Rood etc. Reject! These are ""Headline Indiana Jones"" Wannabee's. There are many fine Bible Believing Archaeologists but they are rarely interviewed or acknowledged.My List of Credible Organizations...- The Near East Archaeological Society- The Associates for Biblical Research- The Institute for Biblical Archaeology- World of the Bible Ministries"
2,Du réchauffé,"D'emblée je suis très intéressé par le sujet et les nouvelles avenues proposées par cette recherche - en particulier un traversée à Nouéba et un Mont Sina en Arabie Saoudite. Mais j'ai été fort déu lorsque j'ai réalisé que le Dr. Lennart Möller était ni plus ni moins le perroquet le Ron Wyatt. Il ne fait que reprendre et exposer les théories de Wyatt, théories largement diffusées sur le web par Wyatt et ses amis. Sérieusement, je m'attendais à plus, et surtout à mieux de la part d'une personne exercée à la discipline scientifique. À présent que j'ai lu le livre, je suis pas étonné que la sortie du film qui lui est associé soit reportée aux calandres grecques. C'est bien dommage, compte tenu de l'importance du sujet et de l'intért des sites qu'il propose pour les épisodes les plus marquants de l'Exode des Hébreux. Un ouvrage rempli d'hypothèses, mais qui ne persuade pas."
2,'What?! You can still fight when yerrrrrrrr drunk!',I give this movie 1 star for the horrible dub and excessive editing (about 40 min worth) from the original film Macross: Do You Remember Love (Ai Oboete Imasuka) from 1984.I also give this version 1 additional star for the dub being so horribly bad that the dialogue is now timeless and classic in a campy sense.
3,"Fine product, but...","This is a good purchase, perfect for completing your collection. Although the quality of the japanese audio its better in other versions and the extras are the weakest point."
3,earrings,"These looked pretty cheapo when I got them, but I guess I shouldn't have expected much given the price. I ended up never wearing them."
4,rockin' roots blues,"Yeah, we all miss Jimmie Vaughns contribution to the T'birds. But I miss Kim Wilson's turban too! However, neither one of them detracts from the fact that this an outstanding CD. This version of the band provides a solid rythym section and Kim Wilson's harp playing and vocals are some of his best.If you like the 'birds and their brand of boogie blues you'll like this CD! OK, maybe I do miss Jimmy's guitar a little bit."
2,A very difficult Kindle read,"This book covers a fascinating subject in great detail, yet it is incredibly dense and difficult to read. Specifically, the Kindle version often fails to separate quoted text via punctuation or font change, creating a constantly changing point of view (which rambles from language to language) that makes it nearly impossible to understand. Add to this some very poor translation and you get a read that is somewhat akin to swimming through molasses."
5,The best TV I've ever owned...,This is the last and the best TV ever released by Toshiba. I learned from research that both the Toshiba 34HF84 and 34HFX84 reportably were the last HD CRT TVs ever made by Toshiba. Picture and color are excellent. Inputs work great. Very high quality. They will be collector's items. I highly recommend this TV to anyone.
4,"Great peaks, no troughs","The opening track's a gem - once heard, never forgotten, and probably danced to. Has the stamp of blues standard all over it, in a rollicking Jimmy Reed sort of way. Over Nevada is a real rarity - try finding it anywhere else - and it's fab. Like a long lost Patti Page single, and a good one. Anders Osborne's track is quite tasty, and the rest is less memorable but always at least pleasant. As a whole, it hangs together very well as a rootsier package than the movie would suggest."
3,Rake review,"The first item came damaged - poor packaging. The second one arrived in good condition and was easy to assemble. The rake is not easy to use as it requires you to throw the item out into the pond and drag it back. The throwing part isn't too bad but the rake ends wrong side up about 20% of the time. The fun begins when you pull the rake to shore with, in my case, lilies. The load gets very heavy until about 50% if it falls off on the way to shore. The short of it is, that if you have the patience and the arm strength this is a practical way to clear the surface of a pond, if it is not too large of one."
4,good helmet,For skateboarding. I bought as a wakeboard helmet but It is not going to last long. Bern makes great helmet and buy this for biking and skateboarding. I think it will be fine in rain but not for wakeboard/kiteboard.
2,Beware. 1 week hasn't shipped,"A week ago, an order was placed. The item still hasn't been shipped out. This item gets a bad review, because the processing company hasn't shipped item, Tempress 6"" Desk Place. Perhaps I should get a 'Backordered' or some notification."
4,burns a bit,"I like the consistency of this product, and I like the natural ingredients. However, while it helps keep my skin moist, it burns my skin a bit when washing. I think it does a good job cleaning, but there may be some caustic herbal preparation in this product that is not great for sensitive skin. I'm not sure I will purchase it again. It may be a bit too strong for me."
5,Best creamy cleanser ever,Excellent cleaser for normal to dry skin...it's a cream cleanser with COQ10 in it and the aroma is great!Effectively cleans but doesn't leave skin tight. It rinses completely.Great value.
5,Love It!,"I can't believe how well this stuff works. I use it as my nightly facial wash and it works so well. I've only used it for about a week but in a matter of days, my face was clearer, brighter, and my skin tone looked more even. Easily one of the best cleansers I have ever used. The fact that it also helps fight wrinkles is definitely a plus!"
1,Zero Stars.,"This video, dated to say the least, gives false and misleading information.Useless as an educational tool and not worth your 27 minutes."
4,"Great CD, but the case was broken?......","The CD was great quality and worth buying. The only problem was that the inside of the CD case was broken. I was a little disappointed with that. But, the CD was great."
3,They Speak with other Tongues,"The author doesn't get into the real information until almost half way through the book.He does, however, give excellent information on the ways of receiving the Holy Ghost and how people react once filled."
5,Timeless writing,"I wasn't born when all of this was going on - the 'Charismatic Renewal'. And John Sherrill wrote this in 1965 I believe. And it is just as relevant for today. It didn't read as something that came across as dated. It seemed very fresh. I loved all of his stories of various interactions with people who spoke in tongues. And it is well written, a page turner. I finished it in a few days and wished it was even longer!I have been a believer and speaker of tongues for over 30 years and never read this book until this year! But finding it now after being in the charismatic wing of christianity for over 30 years, well, it was inspiring and gave me a fresh boost of faith.There aren't many books of this caliber out there about tongues. I recommend this very highly. It's a great read and you will read it once you have it. It isn't one of those books that you start and kind of fizzle out on. You will not regret buying it, and you will wish it was longer."
4,Big Influence on my Life,I read tis book many years ago. It had a real influence in my life. This book and the influence of some others helped me in receiving the Holy Spirit in the same way.
5,Beautifully delivered explication of the baptism.,There's a reason this book has celebrated a 40th anniversary. I was raised Pentecostal and ended up more mainstream as an adult. This book provides an excellent understanding for the reader torn over this topic. It's a heartfelt yet logically sound account of one man's discovery of this very important spiritual gift.
3,THE TONGUE AND WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW,"This little book has a whole lot of history. The curious notion that tongues and the other manifestations of the gifts are not for today is a lie. This little book takes you on a journey of a man who asked the question, ""Why is it in the Bible and is it for us to have today""? There are churches today who do not have these gifts operating at all, and there are some that do. If you haven't experience the gifts its time to search for yourself. And ask the Holy Spirit to reveal these truths to you. The book is awesome. The book is very old but was in good condition. Soon it will be difficult to find this book because they are out of print and only a few I believe are still around."
4,Closer to Four and a half stars,"This is from the complete set of the Liszt-transcribed for piano Beethoven Symphonies from Harmonia-Mundi. It was certainly one of the best, in an otherwise disappointing offering, and is well thought-out and played by one of Europe's finest pianists. The only reason I restrict this to 4 stars is because I've heard the Glenn Gould recording and I'm a Glenn Gould fan, so it's hard to be objective. Many consider this recording by Badura-Skoda to be the best available. In any case, it's a deal at under $6."
4,Wonderful postcard from 1965,"When Ernest Tubb and the Texas Troubadours rolled their tour bus into Tacoma, Washington in 1965, former Troubadour drummer Jan Kurtis was there to record the show. The result is a wonderful un-retouched snap shot of Tubb's live show. Tubb is thoroughly relaxed, taking requests, laughing at blown solos, dedicating songs to people in the audience. During one number a flashbulb in an audience member's camera audibly explodes and Tubb starts laughing about how he thought it was a jealous husband from their previous stop after guitarist Leon Rhodes. (""And if I was scared, think about how Leon felt!""). The Troubadours, led by Rhodes and steel guitarist Buddy Charlton are in fine form. After years of smoking Tubb's voice is sepulchral, but who cares? Remarkably fine sound quality."
1,"""HEED THIS WARNING""","Hydrofarm FLC200D 200W Compact Fluorescent Bulb - DaylightSteer clear of this light!Before purchasing, I read the customer reviews. I noticed many of the reviews mentioned broken lights. So like an idiot, I ordered anyways. Actually, I figured that by now the seller surely would have fixed the problem. I was wrong. My light was packaged well enough and didn't look broken structurally but it failed to work never the less.Long story short, I finally due have a working light but the process took 7-1/2 weeks to play out from date ordered. Needless to say, I am less than thrilled. I never would have made the purchase had I known what I know now.The next 200 watt cfl I purchase will be from a different seller and brand."
1,Broken bulbs,I ordered several of these bulbs. All I got was a headache and all my neighbors wondering why I need so many grow bulbs.I never recieved a single one that wasn't broken. None of the bulbs said fragile or this end up. Nothing. I was very unhappy. I ended up using a feliz bulb.Thank you for reading my review.
2,Good book but....,"It's funny how people look to fairly contemporary works for truth. We all need to look back further. If you want to get to the heart of fasting"" with dramatic examples of God moving then search online for Remarkable Miracles by Bevington and Atomic Power with God through Fasting. You can read them online. They will BLOW you away. I've been studying and searching for over 30 years so take it from me, these are very important works that you don't want to miss and WILL dramatically change your life."
4,Jamaican Smokin' Jazz,"David Hillyard & the Rocksteady 7 is one of those obscure discs that will be a treat to uncover. They formed to create a fusion between Jamaican music, ska & jazz; and the hybrid bubbles with energy and excitement. Two instrumentals capture the imagination. The Beatles' ""Norwegian Wood"" because it is a familiar tune given a totally new twist as a reggae jazz blast that is excellent. My other favorite is ""Skavez"" with its Cuban rhythms of piano mixed with a reggae beat. ""Hillyard Street"" sounds like a soul version of a Ramsey Lewis track. Eddie Ocampo of the reggae band Insteps does some fancy drum work on the driving ""Father & Son."" The title track is like a Jamaican Duke Ellington. ""Ugly Man Blues"" has a zany urgency combined with a Peter Gunn like theme. ""Playtime"" is a mostly instrumental explosion. Seek & you shall find! Enjoy!"
4,A rather stunning swan song i'd say,"I have to admit that i am a subdude newbie, but if this album is any indication of the band's prior work i have a lot to look forward to. This CD has been wearing out my CD player. I bought it when it first came out but i just started listening to it during school finals as i was writing papers, and i must say, it pulled me through some long nights. The album is highlighted by the last song ""bye-bye,"" with it's oh so sweet harmonies, and bitter-sweet lyrics. Another of my favorite subdudes songs, ""all the time in the world"" is on here, but unfortunately it doesn't hold up. the slide guitar is woefully out of tune, but that is the only low point on an otherwise phenominal album."
4,The BEST live band out there,"After seeing Chevelle live in Athens, Georgia, I'm firmly convinced that they are the best live band I've ever seen. The intensity and chemistry of the Loeffler brothers is unparalleled and makes them absolutely dynamic on stage. This CD could be longer, but seeing as it was released before This Type of Thinking, it makes sense. The songs are of great quality for a live CD and the music is as intense as ever. Worth it."
2,"Sadly, I agree with ""monkey_brains7945""","I was very excited to receive my copy of this bootleg, and having purchased some Pearl Jam concerts previously, I expected a lot more quality. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not comparing the two bands at all, but live recordings should have a higher quality standard than the one found on this record. I understand that they're a ""new band"", and their live material is quite limited, but come on! They should have picked better material to put on the record. It's very short and badly mixed. I guess the only thing that kept me from throwing it in my ""crappy cd"" pile, was the autographed cover. If you want live material, buy the DVD instead. It also has some faults, but it's far better than this CD. More material, and perfomed a lot better."
3,meh,"I'm a huge Chevelle fan, and love all their albums. But this one fell short of my expectations. Unlike other reviews, I didn't find anything wrong with the performance end of it. Its Pete doing what Pete does and an excellent example of the original line up. I've listened to many other Chevelle performances via Youtube, and I feel the problem is with the equipment used when they originally recorded the song. The audio quality is poor. Its not worth buying unless your a die hard fan. I would definatly consider just getting one of their studio albums. They're all great and have superb sound quality. This cd does not live up to what the band actually sounds like at all."
5,YOU HAVE NO IDEA JUST HOW GOOD THIS ALBUM IS!!!,"ALTHOUGH THIS ALBUM IS LIVE, IT KICKS ASS THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BAND, IF I COULD ONLY TELL THEM IN PERSON JUST HOW GREAT THEIR MUSIC IS, AND HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THEM PUTTING FORTH THEIR NATURAL MUSIC TALENT. I GOT THIS ALBUM AFTER THEIR CONCERT THAT WONDERFUL NIGHT WHICH WAS HONESTLY THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE, AND I LISTENED TO IT THE WHOLE WAY HOME FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS, AND LOVED IT THE INSTANT I POPPED IT IN. EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO IT, IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES I NEVER WANT TO FORGET FROM THAT NIGHT, YOUR REALLY STUPID IF YOU DONT EVER GIVE THESE GUYS A LISTEN TO, AND IF YOU DONT WANNA IT'S YOUR LOSS, YOUR MISSING OUT ON THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD!!!"
2,Not much help,"This ""kit"" is just some putty tape and some screws... not worth the cost.It would have been just as simple to install with silicone caulk."
2,Not what you'd expect,"If your looking for another Olias of Sunhillow, Song of Seven, or Animation, this is definitely not it. I've loved Jon for many years but was disappointed with this. There's an old man who talks about Indian rituals through the whole thing with Indian flute music and harp accompaniment. Jon adds some of his own vocals every now and then but quickly yields to the old man's jargon and the background music. I give it 2 stars; one for Jon's voice which I love so much and the other for his harp playing which reminded of when he played harp on some of his earlier work with Yes."
4,One of his best solo releases.,"This is vintage Jon. Soaring vocal harmonies (Quick Words/Talk Talk), very ethnic and introspective (Good Day Morning), and the absolute best hymn song Jon has ever sung (Ave Verum Corpus by Mozart). Listen to this song 2 times in a row in the quiet of the night by yourself and you will 1. Cry and 2. Play it again.As a whole it could have been slightly better by eliminating some (although not much) filler and getting a more organic production. But definately step up to the plate and purchase this one before it is discontinued."
3,Good but missing something,I loved the two episodes on here but I remember seeing other Scooby Doo/Globetrotter episodes as a kid. I wonder why they didn't just release ALL of the episodes on one disc. Weird.
3,"Well, it's not the greatest Scooby Doo ever.","Scooby Doo was still in it's early phases back when these 2 hour long episodes were made. So expect it to be very 70's and yet without the charm of the 1969 series. The New Scooby Doo Show at the time had 40 minutes of animation and 20 minutes commercials. This gave the writers a chance to have a bigger story and more mysteries and clues. The Harlem Globetrotters (who?) showed up some of these episodes and this DVD features 2 of them.Unfortunately too much time is devoted to them being rather unfunny than any plot development. And why oh why are they not a natural brown color? Instead the Globetrotters are an un-nervingly vague Michael Jackson greyish color. Either the animation is very old and sun-bleached or that was just bad coloring.The DVD is in 1.33:1 full frame, as originally broadcast with Dolby Mono sound. Some slight extras are included."
4,Classic,"This video is great. I am 17 and still love scooby. the dvd came to me scratched up because the disk was loose in the case, but it still works fine. I would have returned it, but this dvd was out of stock and didnt wont to wait."
2,NOT FOR ME,"This book has an intriguing title and started out fairly interesting and humorous, but it was more of a story about a self-absorbed guy who wanted reformed and admits this is an impossible task. I was horribly turned off when I got to the chapter on flatulence, did not find it humorous and proved to me that this author was, indeed, not reformed at all. I read no further and returned this book."
5,Bruce Cameron is a GENIUS!,"How did I not read this book sooner? I rarely (if ever) laugh-out-loud when reading a book, but this one had my rolling. My husband, in fact, couldn't wait for me to finish it as I would interrupt him every five minutes to read him another hilarious passage. Bruce offers insight into what you can do to change your guy (essentially, nothing) and how you can learn to live happily with his annoying habits (accept them and move on). Seriously, if you've ever wondered what's really going on inside a man's mind (and who hasn't???) READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Sexist,"I read 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, and I really liked it. It was filled with a lot of self-deprecating humor, as you watch Mr. Cameron make a complete fool out of himself. Yeah, it was good. However, he drew the entirely wrong message from the success of that book. He assumed that what people want are books that make men look like a load of laughable dunces.Well, for all I know old Bruce is a dunce, but I, on the other hand, am not. There's a well established market in America for misandrous books, and this book will no doubt appeal to such buyers. If, on the other hand, you don't like sexist humor, then you will not like this book.I hated this book, and highly recommend AGAINST buying it. 1 star is the most I give it."
2,What a disappointment - a big snoozer,"I bought this for my mom-in-law for her birthday, because I had read an article of his that was hilarious - too wordy, but hilarious. I took a peek inside this book, and was so disappointed. It was a major snoozer. Come on man, when you TRY so hard to be funny, it's just not funny. I think he'd do better to stick to articles, not try and fill up a whole book. It just gets soooo wordy that the humor falls asleep (and I almost did) before he finishes a topic. I gave it to Goodwill, not mom-in-law. Maybe someone can save themselves some $$ and a little regret by not buying it new."
5,Closing in on it!,"W. Bruce Cameron has been cracking me up since I discovered his column on-line. He still does.His observations are so clearly male-trying-to-get-it that we ladies should give him a vote of confidence. He is much closer than many men I know! In fact most of them. And the fact that he is trying and attempting to enlighten his brothers is a stellar attempt.His viewpoints are funny, his struggles realistic though clueless, but I really believe his heart is in the right place. There are lots of humor writers, but he's up with the best, if not the best.My Man is going to enjoy this book, I know, for it doesn't offend men. In fact there is much empathy. Of course, we women know that there needs to be even more, but maybe that's being saved for the sequel, ""How to Retro-fit A Man"". I'm sure most of us women know where he can go to get parts.The Mall!I recommend this book! I think it is a lot of fun."
5,HEY LETS TWIST,"I can't say enough about how great this cd is. It's so good and such quality, you think you're right there with Joey Dee and The Starlighters, twisting all night.Joey Dee and the Starlighters are still going strong. Iplay this cd now and go back in time and twist like we did back in the 60's. If you love Joey Dee and the Starlighters, you should buy this cd."
3,Informative - but impossible for research,"Does not contain an index. You must remember the page of each topic in order to return back for research or other recollection. It is informative, just impossible for a class reference."
5,"A Great, Light Album","I have been a big Todd Rundgren fan for over 30 years, so take this review with a grain of salt if you are so inclined. It is my understanding that this album was ""thrown together"" during a contract dispute. This shows in that there are none of the ""heavy,"" introspective songs common to most Todd albums. At the very least, listeners will recognize ""Bang On The Drum All Day."" The other songs are all very light and catchy, easy to listen to. Another one of my favorites off this LP Worth of Tunes is ""Emperor of the Highway."" Anyway, in my opinion, this is a great, fun album."
2,Nothing special about this,"Could have spent half the money that this item cost and bought it local. Nothing special of specific about this bottle, not really a gold specific tool. Shop elsewhere."
4,Excellent compilation but...,"The Blops was an excellent folk rock band on the 70's musical scene in Chile. I remember them. This compilation is very good, but... the order of the list is wrong. The song number two in the disk 1 (Los momentos) really belongs to the song number two of the disk 3: Tartaleta de Frutillas. I hope that in a future edition, this error will be corrected."
5,Dan Never Did A Bad CD,"This is a 5 star CD and you should buy it.The man never did a bad release,he is a total professional."
4,unique collection,this album has several songs that you don't hear on other albums--really like the blues. received it as a gift and have played it several times already.
3,Gotta be honest!,"Sorry guys! I love Dan, I really do, but I was disappointed with this CD. It's another ""best of"" collection and, live or not, it seems to be a ""rehash"" of songs already done on many other albums. ""Greetings From the West"" is a MUCH better LIVE album if you're looking for that experience from Dan. I'd personally like to hear something new! On the positive side, it's great to hear the wonderful guitar work of the man. He really gets to showcase it here. The harmonies and vocals are effortless and the blues songs can really ""take ya there"" so I DO recommend it. Just not as enthusiastically as I'd like!"
4,Great!!,"This knee strap works great! I recommend it for people who have pain, especially during running, in the patellar region to get this! I have been able to run nonstop without pain for the first time in two years!"
1,KNEE REALLY HURT AFTER I TOOK IT OFF,At first I thought it was great. My knee felt great but when I took it off -- OUCH!!! I couldn't walk for two hours. I don't remember hurting that much. I just read that braces are bad for knees. I will return it.
3,Helps a little,It helps me a little. It is better than a sleeve but probably not as good as a real brace. Slides a little and when I make it to tight it bothers me. Okay for walking around.
3,Just ok,Generally this strap does what is suppose to do. I have a pain on the side of my knee and I'm able to rotate it so the pressure points hit exactly on the right spot. But it does loosen while running. I have rather slim legs and this size is definitely too long for me.
1,Not Happy,It was a waste of time and money. It is too flimsy to due anything. I had to go back to an old worn out different style. I am still looking for a good knee brace.................
1,Just another gimmick,"While this does seem to ad a little support to my knee's chondromalacia condition, it's not that wonderful. It's hard to get comfortable and I constantly have to adjust it. It is also very itchy on the back of my knee in the bend area. Also don't plan on wearing this under tight clothing because it either won't fit or will stick out like a sore thumb. It is very bulky. Overall I don't feel it's benefits justify the god awful itching or the constant adujusting everytime I move my knee."
3,"Velcro peels up, Bulky","I've used the McDavid knee strap and it works pretty well for me (loosens when sweating and the ""bump"" is starting to peel up - but it's been used a lot). I decided to try the Mueller strap instead, but I don't like it as much. Because of the thick ""trim"" of fabric all around the edge, the velcro peels up easily (and has actually ruined some of my clothing). Also, it's much more bulky than the McDavid (both because of the thick trim and the ""bump"" being inside a channel of fabric). I don't feel like it ""sets"" into place as well as a result. I'm getting another McDavid one."
5,All you kneed,"I bought this $6 strap and a $20 & $27 (Kneed-it) straps and these worked better. They were easier to synch tighter and therefore stayed in place better. Don't get fancy, get these."
4,Works great,The strap works great. The only reason why I didn't rate it at 5 stars is because it doesn't have a belt loop to keep it in place when you put it on or to help make it tighter.
3,mediocre,The item is alright for short runs; tends to slip off when I run for over an hour. The band is too big for my legs and when I wrap it the rough part of the velcro cuts into the back of my leg.
3,Dubious??,I purchased these to help with PFemoral pain and tendonitis which I experience the most while cycling.Cant say for sure that they solve the problem. They did not 'instantly' elimininate the pain I was feeling nor does it help after a long ride.One issue is that under knee bending while cycling the strap slips down on my leg and takes the pressure off the intended spot on my PTendon. Unless they are VERY tight they will slide down.Jury is still out for me and this product.
5,Great item for my basketball players!,I am a mother of four boys -- all whom have grown rather quickly and seem to have some issues with their knees and flexibility. I bought these straps after a physical therapist friend of mine recommended them. They really do seem to help the boys from having sore knees all the time. Very sturdily made as well.
5,SO GREAT!!!,"First off, I love the color. Judge me if you want, but orange is my favorite. Other than that, these were very cheap so I wasn't sure that they would work well, but they are very well made and provide all the support I could ask for (except emotional). The only issue I could have is that they are a little ""lumpy"" in the sense that the tube inside the strap makes it stand out like an inch from your actual leg. This doesn't bother me though, so all in all, they've been the perfect solution. They provide a lot of support and they're very light. The only issue is if you have thin legs you might have to make it extra tight, and that could be a problem, and sometimes you have to readjust to find the perfect spot, but that's about it. Great product!"
1,Don't order this,You will only get one. You will waste valuable time trying to figure out where the other one is and then you might get a partial credit which is not worth the time you will spend on it. Order a single and see how you like it. This is not a bargain!
1,"ordered two, received one","i should say that the product itself seems to work, but do not purchase this item if it says that the order will be fulfilled by DME Online Sales. i ordered two and only received one. amazon told me the only thing i could do was send it back for a refund. fine. but probably not worth the trouble for a $6 strap."
2,delivery slow,"took about two weeks to get the product since the vendor was out of stock. I have used it for a couple of weeks and cant really feel any difference, I still have an ache in my runners knee.."
1,Uncomfortable,"The basic product does what it is supposed to do; however, there are small very scratchy fibers that stick out of the ends where the Velcro is sewn in. I think these are actually hard plastic fibers from the Velcro that are protruding through the covering fabric. When you fasten it on, if you do not position it exactly right, the little `stickers' bite into your skin and are extremely uncomfortable. In my case I had to repeatedly interrupt my workout to adjust these so they did not irritate my skin. The problem got worse the longer I used them. After a while it was very aggravating, to the point they were not useable no matter how carefully I adjusted them. They went into the garbage and I'm now using another brand, the ""Futuro Sport"" adjustable by 3M, which is available on Amazon."
4,Real Good support strap,"Did not totally relieve me from my knee issues, but helped a lot more than I thought it would. It beats bulky full knee braces and is less than 1/2 the price. I totally recommend this for those with patellar tendonitis."
4,Use for Tendonitis at work,I use this when I do long shifts at work. It works helps my knees feel strong with less pain and somewhat in normal condition again. I only use it for long days though because I do not want my knees to become dependent on them and become weak. THE PRODUCT IS GREAT ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE!!
5,Perfect solution for my sore knees,I'm not a crazy runner or even a competitive runner. I just do it for exercise. As I increased my stamina and mileage my knees started to hurt and ache. A friend suggested these and since I started using them I have noticed a significant difference. Little if any pain in my knees while or after my runs. I would highly recommend these knee straps.
3,buy the other one,"buy this one instead, it is much better and only costs a little moreImak Knee Strap with ErgoBead Pressure Pad"
2,Would be better with a support loop and a complete velcro,"This is my second knee strap. The first one was from Futuro.Futuro lasted ~6 months before getting stretched in a way that made it too large for my knees (I am a 116 lbs woman, so my knees are not large). This one lasted maybe two months. The velcro does not have both parts - the part with hooks gets attached to the material the strap is made of. While it is sufficient when the strap is new, it doesn't hold after a while (as I said - 2 months for me, with 5 runs per week), mainly because the material gets fibers pulled all over. Consequently, the strap keeps falling off during the run (really annoying).As a side note - it doesn't have a support loop so it is not easy to put it in place.It is an OK product - while it lasts (my knee was happy with it on), but I will test the Pro-Tek one next.I'd give it 2.5 stars."
4,it helps but...,"This little knee strap really does prevent knee pain, especially when hiking long distances downhill. I hiked down the South Kaibab trail in the Grand Canyon, an elevation loss of 5,000' in six miles. First time was without the knee brace and I was nearly crippled by knee pain. The next time I used the Mueller Knee Strap and had very little pain at all. The braces can get a little uncomfortable behind the knee but the minor discomfort is worth the reduction in real pain. These braces wear and wash well; mine has lasted over two years now with frequent machine washing (line drying). Even after hundreds of sweaty hiking miles the braces retain no odor at all. One small complaint: with several bright colors to choose from, why not offer a flesh-toned strap as well? I don't want to advertise the fact that I'm wearing knee braces! I'd love to see a neutral color added to the lineup."
1,doesn't fit,"it's about the design, not the size. it tends to slide down no matter how hard you fix it, and it doesn't work anymore when it's not in the proper position.In a word, it doesn't work. Don't buy. The quality is actually okay, but the shape is not good for staying there for protection."
2,Helped with knees...strain on ankles/hips,"I run about 20-30 miles/week and started noticing some knee soreness. One of my friends told me about these straps so I thought I'd try them out since they were pretty cheap. I first tried them during short run and noticed some soreness in my hips/ankles after the run. I didn't try them again for another 4-6 weeks. This next time, I immediately noticed hip/ankle strain within the first 1/4 mile so much so that I had to take them off mid-run (no strain on my knees though!). Maybe I'm compensating my running stride with my ankles/hips? Either way, will never be wearing these again!"
4,works fine,"i hurt my knee running in a race - i bought this so that the knee wouldn't hurt while i ran. it definitely helps, but shouldn't be considered a ""cure"" as my knee hurts just as much when i'm not wearing the strap. BTW, make sure that you wear the strap so that the velcro is on the outside of your knee - i really scratched the skin on my other leg from the velcro the first time i used it."
3,Ok but a pain to use,Works moderately well. Unfortunately the strap is a pain to put into place and tends to irritate the back of the leg and shifts around often. Sometimes the strap causes discomfort on the front of the knee but you can feel the strap helping to stabilize the knee muscles.Overall for the price its worth a use once in a while but for full support one of those full sleeve style knee supports is probably better.
2,knee strap,This brace is probably great for some people but it just didn't work for me. I was hoping to find something fully supportive but not as bulky as a full knee brace (so I could wear it under jeans). It wasn't as bulky as a full knee brace but it also wasn't as supportive so my knee didn't feel stabilized.
4,offers some stabilization,"with chondromalacia, the jumpers knee strap gave me a bit of stabilization for hiking, if i was doing anything more i would need a hinged open-patella sleeve to keep my straying knee caps in place. the strap is small making it easy to carry in pocket or pack as well as being cooler to wear for summer activities."
2,Slides down the leg...,"I have tried several different patella straps for my tendinitis, this was the worst. The strap itself would work fine except for one glaring problem, the cloth doesn't ""bind"" to skin so it slips a few inches down my leg after just a few steps making it useless. I now wrap an ace bandage around it to keep it in place. Once in place, it does it's job."
3,Works well but not as easy to keep it tight.,"This strap works great, I've been using in while running, balling, kickboxing, paintball and many other sports. For the price it can't be beat, but it is starting to stretch out a bit and i need to wrap it around further and further to keep it tight.It's also a bit annoying to put on because I need to use use 2 hands, 1 hand to hold it down while i stick the velcro on. It's very minor but just something to mention. I think the ones which has a ring which you loop through and then velcro back are more effective."
5,Good product,"I enjoy the product . good deliver time, I play alot of basketball and it helps with my patellar tendonitis"
4,Knee Strap,The Mueller Jumper's Knee Strap came just in time. I was experiencing some knee pain and the strap helped disperse the pain so that I could function. After a week or so the pain had diminished almost completely. Great temporary relief for minor aches and pains.
3,not very comfortable,"In order for these to work you have to place them right below the knee cap, but with the strap being so thick and extending all the way around to the back, it's too tight, and it causes pain in the back of my legs, and it becomes very uncomfortable when I try to do lunges. I like the thickness on the front, but I wish the back would have been thinner for comfort and more versatility."
2,Does not stay in place...,"I got this for my runners knee, could not do more then 1/2 a mile before it started slipping. Do not recommend this for athletes or runners, does not stay in place."
4,scary short film,"An exceptionally scary short film, made on a no budget yet thousands of times more frightening than modern slasher fare. The desolate Norfolk broads (an expansion of a river) act as a setting for this truly macabre tale in which an archaeologist is chased by a vengeful spirit after stealing a buried crown. Very hard to find today, the cheap film stock used gives the movie a grainy, realistic look. Definitely a case of ""less is more"", this is without a doubt a 100% perfect realization of the original M.R. James story, and he would be proud."
3,Silk is good,I like the feel of this garment but was disappointed in the length and the overall fit. But being temporarily in snow country I had to keep and wear it. Quality is good if a little heavier than I thought it would be. That would be a plus for some.
4,A Beautiful Book!,"Incontestably a beautiful book in this field. Of very high academic value . If there are more intruduction to strategies of method of suface modification,this book can be called perfect."
5,A Personal Experience,"Reading this book is to personally attend a workshop with the author and to be lead into some deep inner honesty by way of the open sharing of the participants. Real people willingly describe their respective addictions, confronting the pain from which they sought diversion, and their journeys into freedom. I was deeply touched, and challenged to realize there is nothing from which to hide."
2,New-Age stuff again,"I'm so fed up with all the contemporary new-age pseudo-psychology by people with no academic credentials in their fields. This is one more of this sort of literature and, what's worse, it is badly laid out. The first boring half of the book is about what has supposedly taken place during a seminar. The rest is personal stories of people who have conquered their addictions, all sounding rather fake. I would recommend instead ""The Addictive Personality"" by Craig Nakken."
1,terrible,im sorry but this book was beat up drawn in pages with corners pushed down to save there places work to show how the children got there answers and the answers in it there is even a name wrote on a page Rebecca Start if that is a clue for you to know why this book is so out of shape and there are a few pages actually tore im sorry but this was a bad purchase and the book covers don't match either I was hopeing for my daughters same math book to come here for home schooling so we could start were she left off but the picture shown is not the book I have got today
4,Lindsays Rule OK -- but they cheated,"CUSTOMER in Maui is right: this is a DDD upsampled ('enhanced') to SACD! One expects better from a 2000 recording by ASV.I still like the recording/performance inmensely, but I'm withdrawing a star, because the DDD origins of the recording are well-hidden from the buyer: a little DDD on the disc itself, and another on the box back; SUPERAUDIO is blazoned all over...."
5,"have other cds in series, and plan to get this one","Volumes 2 and 3 are excellent (though not sacds). I assume this (Volume 7) is about as good.The cds in the series are ""recorded at DCS 24-bit A to D convertors at a sampling rate of 176.4Khz."" This is not a 16-bit 44.1 Khz recording!SACDs have ""a high sampling rate system with 1 bit resolution of 2.8 Mbps"" but sound equivalent to DVD-Audio discs which have 24 bit / up to 196Khz specs. (from what I gather on the web).The recording done for this cd seems like a very pretty good recording quality if microphoned correctly. So what if it is not DSD - it is pretty close, and may be equal or better, right?If someone out there knows more, please correct this discussion. Thanks."
5,FAMILIAR GROUND,"So much of real life to have spread before you with such touching and accurate emotions...I read it in one sitting as the mystery holds you till the end....yet no ending....another book to follow?The characters are real, what they elicit from one another is real, and if you have lived at all you have met them all."
5,Wonderful read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! My mother was born in 1912 and just passed away last year at the age of 99. This book brought back many memories of the stories she would tell us, but it also helped me see my mother as a young girl growing up in very difficult times rather than seeing her as my mother who told us tales of days gone by. Penelope Stokes is a very talented writer and made me feel as if I was right there with her - I KNOW these ladies! What a truly wonderful gift she has."
2,Christian literature does not have to be this bland,"I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this book. A dear friend of mine recommended it. But unfortunately, it did not do much for me. It upsets me that in general, music and literature labeled as ""Christian"" turns out to be mediocre. Now, don't jump all over me. This is my humble opinion, and i can think of some great exceptions in both areas, where the music is great and the book is thought-provoking and enticing. This book was not. At times it read like a Christian soap-opera. I can see how this book might be a good read for a teen, because the language is simple, the situations are predictable, and the book lacks depth (something that might be confusing for a young person). But i would not recommend it for an adult. Hey, just my opinion. Don't get too bent out of shape :-)"
4,Keep your eyes and heart-open....frienships endures,"On the brink of the Depression, four young women place their innermost hopes on slips of paper, place them in a bottle and pledge to support each other's dreams. Life, however, has a way of upsetting the most planned path, and each of these four young women find themselves on a path not anticipated. Over 50 years later a young TV reporter reporting on the demolition of a once stately home, is handed the blue bottle by a construction worker. Brenden Delaney begins to search for these women, to see if life has met their expectations and hopes. Her journey leads her to the discovery of each woman, a glimpse into their lives and the rekindling of a long ago friendship. Brendon also has some soul searching of her own, and as she works to compile the story of the Blue Bottle Club. This ia a wonderful novel of friendship and relf realization. Some may be put off by its distinctly Christain leanings, but will find that it does not surender to cliches."
2,"Heavy duty ""Christian"" theology; light-weight characters","Someone in my book group picked this book, and boy am I disappointed. I got through the Letitia section all right, and then the real preaching began. W.Publishing Group does nothing but ""Inspirational"" books. I consider myself spiritual, but I gagged on the piety and stereotyped characters. A spinster school teacher fulfilled by her students? The unwed mother rescued by the selfless restaurant owner after being taken advantage of by a Hollywood producer? Nasty untrustworthy men and the horrible rich! The poor Presbyterians geally get slammed in this book. Religious soap opera in print."
4,What a Great Book!,"I truly enjoyed reading The Blue Bottle Club. Not only did I become friends with the characters, but I also grew spiritually while listining to their faith in God. This is one book any woman or girl will relate to and enjoy. I especially think Chicken Soup people should read this book."
4,Very realistic and moving journal of four lives ...,"As an avid reader of Christian fiction, I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Blue Bottle Club.' Its premise was thought provoking and could've been the setting for a far-fetched, 'too good to be true' ending, but it wasn't. Each life story was different and drew the reader into the complex world of 'real life.' The beautiful thread that wove these stories together was the same one that binds us as fellow believers: our all-faithful, all-gracious, and Almighty God. This book will help you draw closer to Him, and linger there, as you consider the truths it reveals."
2,Sweet....,"I didn't hate it, I didn't feel that I had wasted my time after having read it but I too felt it was a bit shallow and contrived. If you enjoy depth in novels, skip this one. Sorry Penelope."
2,Unbelievable plot and cover,"Too much coincidence in this book to make a believable plot- one character just happening to get a postcard after decades, no one recognizing a character when she returns to her hometown and attends her own memorial service, etc.I read the hard cover and realized the cover designer never read the book or would have depicted the blue bottle in the title differently and would never have included a beach photo as the girls never went to the beach together."
2,Fun while it lasts,"My 10 year old son got this for Christmas and loved it, so he was upset when its legs started breaking off soon after. I'm not going to claim he cautiously handled it, but he was never hard on it either, and the legs started breaking off anyway. It loses the effect with 7.... 6.... 5.... legs. So if you can find it for $10 go for it."
2,Disappointed,It is too big and not very realistic. Also very noisy. Not worth the price. It could be easy to break.
2,Not for rough handling!,"My 11 yr old thought this was amazing but the maneuver wheels on the bottom will only run over hard surfaces and not carpet which was OK with us. He did, however, run it over carpet and the traction wheel rubber pully snapped. The legs are also quite fragile and after only 2 days of play, one of the legs broke. Because of that, the spider cannot ""walk"" now! Too bad because its looks great. We are going to send it back."
3,Scary Realistic,"I bought this for my husband as one of his Valentine presents. He was delighted, but a little disappointed that it made loud mechanical noises which would give away (as if the red light on top of the spider wouldn't!)that it wasn't real. As other reviewers have said it won't work on a carpeted surface. Very realistic - I hadn't realized I have a slight case of arachnophobia. I could hardly bear to touch it to insert the batteries. Note this product uses 2 AAA in the remote and 2 AA in the spider."
4,The most fun spider around,"I gave this trantula to my boss who is a consumate practical joker. It got the desired result; a scream heard around the office. This is a fun toy. They need to make a model where the eyes do not light up, though. The batteries also run out pretty quickly, so rechargables are probably the way to go."
4,Lifelike tarantula movement,"In the short time on Christmas day that my brother (60 years old!) played with this, we got a kick out of it. The control did not always respond well, but we thought that might be a 'contact' issue. When moving and turning, the leg movement was surprisingly realistic. (We grew up with tarantulas in the backyard near Saddleback mountain in Orange County, California).At this price, would highly recommend."
1,Wish It Worked!,"We bought this toy for our 7 yr old daughter who just 'had to have it'. It is very life-like. When it works, it's a pretty good toy. What we've found, though, is that it will work for about 5 min. on a set of new batteries. After that, the R/C range diminishes to nothing and the only way to control the spider is to have the R/C controller antennae touching the one on the spider. Not too much fun in that."
3,Needed tinkering,"When I got this tarantula I thought I had bought a bum set of batteries. I'd install batteries and hit the radio control buttons. It would function well for a few seconds then groan to a stop like the batteries had run down. Not seeing anything to lose with a [...] buck toy, I went into it (6 or so screws, two quite well hidden). Turns out the motor housing was screwed together too hard, just a little loosening of the screws took care of the problem, thought relocating the legs into their proper places took some figuring (they tend to spill out when the body is disassembled). Now it works fine and is just the thing to give guests a quick surprise."
2,I'm sorry I dident get it off the net,"I bought the CD going only on Paul Oakenfold name. I like him and what he has put out in the past. I never saw the movie. I played the CD and was not happy I loved only 2 songs from it and wish I had not bought it. The tracks are basic and really dont have very much heart to them. Its a good CD to just put in at work or at home surfing the web, But its not something to put in at a party and try to dance by! I should have Downloaded it from the internet."
5,Swordfishing in the deep....,"This soundtrack rocks! I think Paul did an excellent job in developing not only a soundtrack that compliments the movie, but that stands on it's own two feet. That, and the album does a great job of integrating snippits of the film, giving you nice flashbacks of cool parts of the movie. ;) The mix with Jan on vocals is pretty sweet (Unafraid)."
1,not the oakenfold who made history,"if you've discovered the oakenfold from works like Global Underground: New York and his flawless essential mixes, then don't touch this cd with a ten foot pole. this cd is strictly for the mainstream drivel who don't know what a good mix is. oakie obviously tried too hard making this thing appeal to the mainstream - sorry i'm not good with details except that this thing was the first of many unfortunate oakie attempts at the mainstream us market..."
2,The missing song,"The song I was looking for is likely the one you're looking for, but they didn't include it here. It's the one when the main guy is writing the worm, staying up all night, with the sample ""fifty thousand watts of funkin.""It's ""High Voltage"" by Frank Popp."
4,pumpin' & fast-paced,"One thing I noticed in this album is sloppy editing at the end of some tracks. More than several tracks get cut off abruptly and it can be annoying for someone who was expecting this album to be a continous mix like his other albums. Oakenfold has picked quite a different array of music for this compilation. Don't expect it to be like his other albums like the GU series, Tranceport, Travelling or Another World. Swordfish is a nice compilation of progressive trance (vocal based and instrumental) and hard-rockin' break beats. The album is a bit similar to ""The Saint,"" and ""The Jackyl"" sountracks. Overall,I thought it was pretty good. I feel it'll be one of those albums that'll get mixed reviews."
3,Nothing spectacular,"I kind of agree with the others who listened to this album and shrugged their shoulders. There's some decent stuff and quite a bit of filler. Not Oakenfold's best work, but the album is worth getting solely for the SPECTACULAR Jan Johnston track ""Unafraid""."
4,It's a movie soundtrack. It's not a party album,"I hear things like, ""It's not like his other work"" or ""You can't dance to it"" or ""It's different and eclectic"". Paul is usually spinning stuff to party to. He's one of the biggest DJ's in the world and even the smallest house party has someone wanting to thow on an Oakenfold CD.Swordfish: The Album is a soundtrack to a film. And the film is not Gidget 2000. Finally someone up there got some brains and decided that a techno film could use a techno soundtrack. Oakenfold does this better than any of the best score composers out there.The people that seemed to like this album the least were also the ones who never saw the film. Do yourself a favor and see the movie. Then you won't need my review to help you decide on whether to buy this album or not.I rated this album on what is, not what it's not."
3,Oakenfold is always gold,While I enjoyed the disc (never saw the movie) I do not keep it in the rotation that some of his other discs are in my player (i.e. Transport) either way it is still Oakenfold and therefore still pretty darn good.
4,Name of song from the movie,"Anyone know the name of the song where Stanley is hacking, hes putting the cubes together, the song starts off with that steezy bassline?"
2,Disappointing,"I haven't seen the movie Swordfish because I've heard it's not that great, but I have heard plenty from Paul Oakenfold. His mix CDs set the high mark for trance compilations, but this soundtrack is most definitely not his best work. These tracks sound contrived and completely out of context. Please save me from the extremely annoying Travolta dialog mixed in from the film. Stick to Paul's DJ mix compilations to avoid disappointment."
5,This is a score ?,"great score, or if you havent seen the movie, great cd. this one goes up their with oakenfolds live at ibiza and buenos aires.the music acomadates the film very well. its way to cool. i, still play ""dark machine"" and pretend im john travolta existing in a world beyond my world. truly an awsome cd all around."
3,o.k. but not Oakenfolds best,"It's great to see DJ's such as Paul Oakenfold get recognition by mixing the entire soundtrack of a summer movie but maybe because he didn't get to pick out the entire soundtrack for the movie that this mix CD just doesn't live up to his previous releases. Yes, 7 songs have been remixed/touched by Oakenfold but the whole thing sounds a little forced. Remember that this is a soundtrack and not one of his club mixes performances on a CD. Definitely for the Oakenfold or movie fan."
3,Fan of Oakenfold,"Purchased this because there were songs by Paul Oakenfold that appear only to be available for the movie.Most are great but I was really looking for about 3-4 of them.Overall, if you like this style of music......I would recommend."
2,great but not so great,when i got this mp3 player i was very surprised at how small and light it was i tryed putting song on it but i had bought songs off walmart.com and apparently they dont work..so i had to copy the songs on to a cd and take them to a different pc and download on that pc...which meant i had to go through and type in all the songs titles in myself...but once i got the songs on there the audio quality was great and the built in speakers r very handy
5,heartfelt accounts... children's 'history' of Civil Rights,"Touching and powerfully honest personal accounts of the daily lives of children / youth in the Civil Rights Movement. Children surviving domestic terrorism in a culture of violence, ever hopeful of realizing "" all men are created equal"". Though it documents 'traumatic' incidents the focus is on courage , hope, and our personal responsibility for making the world a better world. For the children each day, each choice, each action made a profound vote for justice and equality. They are truly activists, and advocates for 'humanity'. Our elementary class uses this book to learn about and portray each person. They often seek to emulate them.The children respectfully honor these young heroes, and find their own 'voice'."
5,"Good Text, Clear and Well Organized","I am a Java instructor and have found many of the current books on java to be to disorganized to plan lectures arround, this was not the case here.The lecture notes provided online are an unexpected and usefull bonus. If you teah Java you definately need to check this out. It is one of the best."
3,Mini Fridge Sits on My Desk at Work,"This product does not keep as cold as I would like it to. I like my drinks cold, and it only stays moderately cold. For instance, I left my sandwich in there overnight, and it was soggy and warm the next day. The drinks are luke warm, but it does act like a big cooler that can keep food and drinks chilled for a short period of time. The size of it is perfect b/c it can sit directly on my desk at work and not get in the way. I just wish it was a little colder inside."
1,Not worth the money,"I love Nassim Haramein's work, but this video is not worth the money. If you have interest in quantum physics buy ""Black Whole"" instead."
5,Lights of the Inside Passage,Excellent read for those interested in history of the Canadian West Coast Light Houses. Hats off to those brave souls who manned the Lighthouses for the safety of those at sea.
5,my pink floyd 2007 souvenir,"i live in lima, peru. roger waters is playing pink floyd music next week in my city for the first time, so when i needed a wall calendar i was lucky i found this one in amazon. to my surprise the band pics are in chronological order, from early pre-floyd pics (january) to the live8 'reunion' pics (december) so i will keep the calendar after 2007 is over, as a collector's item."
2,Terrible,"Strange how this song was responsible for Napster's shutdown. It's sad that this song also is one of the rock bottom songs of Metallica's career.Currently waving the banner of SELLOUTICA or ALTERNICA (take your pick), I must say that I was shocked by this song. I love Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, ...And Justice for All, and even the Black album to an extent... but this one pushes the Load/Reload envelope further. This is utter [poo.] And not only does this song [smell] it also reminds us that Metallica only cares about money and the record industries, not for the fans that love them.Why 2 stars then? Because Kirk Hammett does give a good solo. Unfortunately, it only lasts for a few moments, which is a shame. Metallica shouldn't even have [complained] about this song being downloaded... if you liked the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack, that's the only reason you should have this song in your possession. Bypass the single entirely."
4,Metallica in the year 2000,"I've been a Metallica fan for about 2 years now and I have nearly all their albums, I was was good to hear that Metallica were doing a song for MI 2. I disappear as an individual song is great. The rhythem guitar is nice and heavy and the solo is great. I reckon this song is an example of what Metallica's next album will sound like, which is good. A bit heavyer than the styles in Load and Reload, but when you think back to the the great Metallica albums, as in The Black Album, Master of Puppets etc... I Disappear is nothing"
1,Garbage,"I don't know if this is the worst song Metallica ever wrote, but it's definetely the worst one that ever became a single. This stinks a mile away."
3,Eh...,"When I first heard this song, I thought it was pretty good. Now, having had it drilled into my brain by the mainstream, I am not terribly impressed. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Metallica fan, and I would never admit to any song by Metallica being bad, but let's face it, this was a feeble effort on their part. I mean, the lyrics are weird, and the guitar almost sounds like Limp Bizkit (the solo is the only thing confirming it isn't Limp Bizkit). Maybe it's just because it was made for a soundtrack, I don't know if people felt the same way when Megadeth made ""Angry Again"" (though I prefer that song over this one). Anyway, my faith in Metallica is not gone, I have no doubt in my mind they can do better, and who knows, maybe in a few years I'll have a better appreciation for this song, but for now I'm scrambling for my Iced Earth CD's every time it comes on."
1,It IS time you disappear!,"Oh man, what has Metallica done to themselves? I used to defend Metallica and tell people they didn't sell out, and this is how they repay me? So, they're doing songs with turntables now? Geez man, I never thought I'd see the day. Guys, I think you should do one of two things: go back to the basics, or just break up already. If this is the kind of stuff you're going to do from now on, just forget it. I can just hear all the Limp Bizkit fans talking about how much this rules, and they've probably never even heard songs like ""Master of Puppets"" or ""Creeping Death"". Well, I'm done ""toughing out the bad years"". I give up. You people want to hear some real metal? Check out Iced Earth. Metallica is dead to me."
5,THE BEST,"I think this song is the greatest.It has great heavy metal guitars and is a very addictive song.I think anyone who doesn't like it should shut up.And think to yourself ""Am i really a heavy metal fan?"""
5,Great Metallica new songs !,"it's music of first metallica's written song from orginal movie soundtracks !and best Performenced music of kirk's wah-wah Sound !worst john woo's movie, but best soundtrack of metallica new song !"
5,The Future of Metallica right here!,"This single is great! It shows us that there is still plenty of great Metallica songs to come, and I cannot wait!"
4,Too Cute!,I bought this for my grandson and it was so cute. Everyone enjoyed it. A bit big for new borns. Perfect for 2 year old.
4,Really is squirrel proof,"The squirrels have tried, but they have not been able to damage this feeder. I did place an old 33 recond album just above the feeder and they have been unable to jump down."
2,The Only Option For the Moment,"I won't go into great detail about the movie itself except to say it's a very low budget effort from 1969. Many might be familiar with it from showings on TV throughout the 1970s. For those who are interested, the Sinister ""special edition"" is a DVD-R of a VHS tape, itself sourced from a very mediocre print. The 2nd disc is a ""scope"" version of the same. Extras include one trailer. So if you want it, this is the only ""DVD"" option as of this writing. It would be great if this could get a better quality release as the film is not without its charm and features earnest performances from most of the cast (little known John Lodge in particular) but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that to happen."
4,The above reviewer obviously knows nothing about pomade...,"REAL pomades like this one never wash out with soap and water, and are meant to be left in the hair for short term. The stuff you buy in the salon for twice the price isnt real pomade -- its made differently, and just doesnt work the same way once in your hair.in order to get it out, you need to wash it with something that cuts the grease, like dish soap, lemon juice, or another de-greaser.listen folks, this is the kind of stuff used for the 50's ""Greaser"" hairstyles, its gonna be greasy. Although this one isnt really too greasy, it's more for hold than shine, and is very stiff. You want something shiny, try some Royal Crown.Personally I'll use something like this or murray's first, and then I'll put on something like royal crown after to add shine.so yeah, this stuff is pretty decent, try it for yourself and see if you like it."
2,Not so great,"I wanted this hair wax for a while, and once I got it I realized how disgusting it was. The wax does not wash out of your hands, you need to wipe them with a towel for a while. Also, the wax takes a week after you stop using it to finally all wash out of your hair. It turns you into a human greaseball. Yes, it does provide a good hold but it is a hassle to wash out and style. I do not recommend Dax Wax to anyone, stick with gel!"
1,useless and awful to wash,"Don't every buy this product ,, there is no way to wash your hands with a regular soap or water. It was too sticky and there was no way to wash my hair ""I washed my hair twice after I had it on my hair, I had to wash it because I didn't like it "" they want you to buy the oil shamboo from them to wash your hair, but why you would buy the shampoo if the Dax it self useless"""
4,I like it,I like making a little spike .. and couldn't find anything better than Dax wave and groom .. I tried dax short and neat but it's nothing it's useless not like this one .. so this is the best product for my hair
4,Works well.,"This product works for what its intended to do. I bought it for the lady cause she likes to garden. I haven't had any problems, nor has she complained about it."
2,Horrible sound,"I like Bernstein's conducting but this is the worst sounding sacd I own. Very hard, harsh, sounds like an early CD and no bass."
2,Needs steady wind to produce any power,"I mounted this turbine in my back yard on the recommended schedule 40 galvanized pipe at about 20' high. My location does not get consistent wind from one direction which is the only way this turbine will spin. Even in gusty conditions of 15-20 mph the turbine rarely spins more than a few revolutions and has not produced any measurable power after a month. If you don't have a steady wind from one direction this turbine will not produce any power at all. You would be better off with a vertical turbine or one with larger blade surface area. The specs say 8 mph start up, that means a consistent 8 mph wind from a single direction. For the money you would be better off with a single 80 watt solar panel."
1,unhappy customer,"This product was ordered and received, but failed in the first week.Product was returned to manufacturer and as of May 23rd, 2011 we have not received the new wind generator nor a refund. We have been told several times it is in the process of being sent (new one) and as of this date have received nothing. is there anything anyone out there can do???"
1,piece of junk,"bought this wind generaotor 5 years ago under brand name air x, only use it a couple months in winter. never got close to their rated output.takes quite a bit of wind to get the prop turning and just a smitten more wind will put it in (dis)gust mode.better spend some more money to begin with and get something decent."
2,Watts=Volts X Amps,"27 Amps X 14 Volts = 378 Watts therefore 2-3 amps is unacceptable if batterys are low, unit is either defective or way over rated.... unless batteries were almost full then 2-3 amps is normal since regulator is tappering down voltage,"
1,Needs a Hurricane,"Nice generator BUT as it says, you need 28mph sustained wind (should say 40mph) at the generator to get the advertised power. I have had mine for 4 years and have never had it get up to charging, and I live in a very breezy area and sometimes very windy. Buy a windmeter for $30 and measure your area because there are not too many places in the world that get this continuous sustained high wind enough to make one of these useful. The windmill only begins producing even just a trickle of low-voltage power once above 20mph which is still a lot of wind. You also need a long heavy industrial electrical cable as well as a tower and can either build your own or buy theirs. Either way, you'll spend another several hundred dollars and lots of time. I have solar also and would recommend one of those instead, unless you live in an extremely continuously windy area."
2,"It looks Nice,but....","Purchased My first wind generator a month or so ago,and found that the shaft was turning inside the front bearing as unit would not start up in less than a 25mph wind,rma'd back to amazon (there the best) and no thanks goes to southwest,8 days for a reply....slow to say the least...anyhow I have my replacement unit,and it does spin up easier,however the output is nowhere near the rated 27amps,I am seeing 2-3 amps barely @ 30mph winds,so to close,I'm gonna keep this one,just for the fact that its here and it looks cool up on the pole,but in the future I think I will just keep expanding my PV array,seeing 5+ amps from 7 sunforce 15watt panels in winter sun...."
2,Complete Waste Of Energy & Money,"Folks, unless you live in one of the very few windy locations and most of those places are rural, what good is a wind turbin for $2,000+?I can charge batteries for pennies, charge my shaver, my boat and RV batteries with utility power at 12 cents per kwh. Also, consume 120 or 240 power for the same cost. Yes, in the long run it adds up but I don't have to maintain the power supply either.Wind energy is a long way from being feasisble to own and maintain let alone sell it's power to the grid."
5,fill-your-collection-with-dub-music,I purchased the Volume 2 Trojan DUB Box Set for it has many reggae dub selections to round out my library of music. It is a must purchase for anyone interested in what is in the the Trojan vaults. enjoy!
5,a must have for any fan of dub music.,"best.box.set.ever.if you like dub AT ALL, you MUST purchase this box set. it's 3 cd's of the best dub you'll ever hear."
5,all time favorite,"I still have a copy of this in my home for my 20 year old daughter to re-read, and then for my granchildren to read."
5,Witty and Charming,This is one of my favorite movies. It's witty and charming. I think the screenplay is great. I loved the diversity of characters in the film. It always makes me laugh!
3,Vey long,"This wasn't the comedy I expected. Well, the first half was. The second half was OK, just not my type of movie, I guess. It seemed to drag on until I wondered if it would end. I'm only 23 so maybe I just don't appreciate the whole point of the movie. It got way too mushy for me. I guess stories about people who mess up their lives like this don't grab my sympathy.The humor was hilarious, and the plot was meaningful and all that, and the actors were great, which is why it gets 3 stars from me."
3,"Great first half, then...","""Something's Gotta Give"" is about an aging bachelor who is so accustomed to dating women half his age that once he meets a sexy and sophisticated peer of his the romance hits a sour note. This film was a dissapointment overall to me, the fault of which lies in its writing and directing. Jack Nicholson gave a great performance, and Diane Keaton deserved her Oscar nomination (and maybe even deserved to win), but try as they might they could not save the film.My dissapointment in the film is so because the first half was so good. It is very fresh and funny, then things all go downhill. The film loses its wit, and the story's devices (the young doctor as only an obstacle to Henry and Erica, the daughter as only a way for them to get together) become very apparent. The ending had no originality or chutzpah in any way, and the corny dialogue made it a groaner. I give three stars for the first half, but still reccomend it if you need a nice and airy romantic comedy."
4,Clever and Witty!,"Great film. Diane Keaton certainly steals the show in this one, still looking Dynamite and exuding that girlish vulnerability that makes her desirable. What a charmer--and that impassioned kiss she gives Nicholson, like lovers who can't get enough of each other.The movie very quickly touched on the gender issues and cliches i.e. men vs. women, youth and aging, and then moved straight into the meat of the story...all the facets of falling head-over-heels in love with someon. I especially loved honest truth expressed by that fabulous line Diane's character imparts to her daughter, ""Honey, do you really think you can outsmart getting hurt?""The message seems simple: you cannot hide from love forever. Get over yourself and enjoy it."
3,Just in it for Nicholson.,"I got hold of this movie by chance and kept on my shelf for about 2-3 months when I finally decided to watch it for the sake of habit. I was in it for the simple fact that Nicholson was the main actor and having seen other of his movies, I can say he's a great actor and a funny guy. Diane Keaton (plays the role of Erica Barry), on the other hand, is a stiff playwright, hasn't had male company in some time now, but in the end falls in love with Nicholson's character, Harry Sanborn, a successful businessman and playboy, despite Julian Mercer's (Keanu Reeves) desperate efforts to win over Erica (!?). Having seen this movie, I definitely think it's not meant for the younger audience, but mostly for middle-aged women. The film has a few funny quotes but it's nothing special. As I said, Nicholson is the star of this movie."
3,Forget about the movie watch it for Diane Keaton.,"Alright, you have got two hours and nothing to do then watch this movie. ""Something's Gotta Give"" is kind of a movie I would want to like, but somewhere in between the story just looses the point. The cast was perfect, so was the acting by Keaton (looked dead dazzlingly beautiful) and Jack Nicholson. Don't ask about Keanu Reeves, anyone could have done that role (I am getting worried about his carrier now).Anyway, the story is good but somehow it's not been directed the way people will like it. After the half part of the movie, the story falls apart, and you actually wish it to end soon. Something like incomplete...it is like getting an automobile with some parts missing. I am giving three stars only for Diane Keaton, who made it worth to watch this movie."
3,"Diane, Diane, Why?",(...)Why ever would a beautiful woman like Diane's character fall for an old crotchety goat like Jack when she has that hunky doc at her beck and call?Jack Nicholson is we(...)ll past his prime - and in my book was NEVER attractive.Had quite a bit of difficulty suspending my disbelief on this particular one. (Actually the whole sex thing with him made me a bit queasy - regardless of the age of the female he was bedding.(...)
3,Predictable yet enjoyable,"I don't know if it's fair to call this movie a chick flick. It can be considered so every bit as much as Mel Gibson's ""What Women Want"": it is a chick flick with a twist, where the chauvinistic ""highly coveted"" bachelor is redempted from his world... well, sorta!The movie is quite predictable: there are some sex scenes; romantic moments with french music, wine and the beach, and tales of heartbreak and reconciliation. For such a repeated plot, you probably wouldn't give the movie too much credit, but except for a few moments, the movie is actually saved by the performances of the two leads, mostly Diane Keaton, who played a brilliant part that will make you laugh real hard.I don't think it's ""the worse movie ever"" or some other categorizations it's received like that, but there are far better movies (and stories) out there (if you want to dig into the theme, do pick up the Gibson flick I mentioned earlier -you're bound to like it even more). Overall, I give it 3.5 stars."
3,Good performances but....is it over yet ?,"Something's Gotta Give starts out with energy and charm. Nicholson and Keaton have great chemestry as two older people trying figure out, what now ? They're two successful and experienced people but neither of them really know what love is. They aren't crazy about each other at first but of course they fall in love. After they have ... though and fall in love, it should've just ended. Instead it goes on and on with Keaton wanting a relationship and Nicholson not knowing what he wants. By the time he figures out what he wants, most of the movie's charm is gone and it over-stayed it's welcome. The performances make you stick with it though even if you just want it to end already. Although the supporting work by Keanu Reeves, Frances Mcdormand and Amanda Peet are all good. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson carry this movie mostly on their own and do really good jobs at that. Cut off about 45 minutes and it would've been better though."
5,Jack does it again,"My hubby and I just watched this movie over the weekend and we loved it. Both are big fans of Jack Nicholson and were not disappointed. This was absolutely a feel good movie with lots of humor. Diane Keaton was fantastic. Jack's character suffers a heart attack and is given a second chance at life and love. Diane's character is an uptight playwrite that wears turtlenecks in the summer and has given up ever finding love again when along comes Jack. Its really a fun, laugh your butt off kind of movie."
4,Great fun,"Not exactly what I expected, but very good. Keanu is absolutely yummy in his role, makes you want to melt for him. Alas, Keaton and Nicholson have great chemistry on screen!"
2,"Cute, but too long and too sappy","I believe this was a case of the film being overhyped to me before I saw it. It was ok, but nothing incredible. I thought Nicolson and Diane Keaton were quite funny and really at their best, but the material was a little dumb, the events hokey and contrived, and the film was too long. They could have cut about 30 minutes out of it, streamlined it somewhat, and it would have been better. I saw it with a person their age who despised it as being absolutely stupid and unreal. I guess my suggestion is, is you're 60-ish, you might really hate it. It is worth the price of a rental or pay-per-view, but to me, only barely. Wait until it comes on cable and you can see it for free, but it is worth seeing."
3,Unmemorable!!!,"This is a fun and cute comedy with a great cast and beautiful scenery, but it drags on WAY too long, and ultimately ends up as an unmemorable waste of 2 plus hours. I know I would have liked it more had it been about 20 minutes shorter. Either way, this is worth seeing for fans of Diane Keaton, who just sparkles. Jack Nicholson is his usual self, but I LOVE Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand, who unfortunately, aren't given much to do. Keanu Reeves is less irritating than in his other films and luckily, has a small role. I'm glad I saw this, but it is way overhyped by critics. The usual formulaic Hollywood romance, only this time, the ones who fall in love are old."
3,It was a decent movie but SO predictable,Something had to give eventually for this movie to finally end. It kind of took forever to get it to end it ran about 30 minutes to late. I still thought it was a funny smart romantic comedy about older people but I truly think that Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton didn't need the sex scenes to get this movie passed. I think these two people have chemistry when they talk but when they are making out I get stomach cramps especially that part where Nicholson cuts Keaton's turtleneck off with a scissor and begins to desire her I just think these look really bad in bed together. This movie was decent though because It had a feel good feeling to it. I feel though that at the beginning the movie was off to much more but by the middle of it the film slowed down and got a little mellow for not just me but for alot of people. But I would see it again.
2,Boredom sets in long before the end credits begin to roll.,"The above title was taken from a revire I read somewhere in the Web, and I think it says it all. This movie is boring. It begins with a good premise, then everything goes down. And it's not funny at all. I don't know how it was advertised as a comedy. It's almost a total drama, with romantic obvious ending.The performances by everyone involved are great, and I was sorry that Paul Michael Glaser and Francis McDormand had so few time on screen. Keanu Reeves proved that there's life after his disastrous performances in both sequences of MATRIX (script's fault, not his, and Amanda Peet in very likeable as Keaton's daughter."
2,Predictable and in the end annoying,"If the movie starts greatly, it sure ends really badly. The last 40 minutes are just a waste and repeat the exact same jokes than in the beginning.The story is not the exact same one than in ""as Good as it gets"" but you can feel that it is a copycat, and unfortunately, a really poor one. Watch it once if you can't help it, but please, even if you have watched it ten times, ""As good as it gets"" is way over this one. We can't even compare them because ""Something's gotta give"" just seems lame next to it.The only thing that made me give a 2-stars is because the actors are great, but the story is so poor."
4,"An Enjoyable Movie about humor,tears &lots of love/","I had heard so much about this film that when it came outI kept putting it off, because those are the movies that for me never live up to the hype. I try to see ""hyped"" movies the first day before I can have preconceived ideas that make me expect to much. So when it came out on dvd last week I bought it figuring enough time had passed for me to enjoy it. Besides how bad could a movie with Jack and Diane be? Well I enjoyed it ,understood Diane's character and wanted the movie not to end. To me the true test of a classic movie for me is that I will want to watch it again. This is a feel good, glad to have it in my ""classic"" collection"" movie. I also like any dvd that has behind the scenes director's thoughts ect. To me this is what makes DVD's different from vhs. This movie had great extra's and I can't wait to watch it all again. A movie like this is like a great wine it get's better each time I watch it."
4,Good fun!,"I really enjoyed this film. I didn't go in expecting it to be a life altering experience, I went to see it to be entertained. And entertained I was!Jack is playing....well Jack. He is good at playing Jack. But he was not the best thing about the film by any means.Diane Keaton was wonderful. She would just light up the screen and is such a natural.I wish Frances McDormand was in the film longer, loved her character.But the absolute surprise for me was Keanu Reeves. I thought he was wonderful in this film. Maybe he is starting to loosen up and go with the flow more now he is getting older, but never really being a fan of his at all (ok I loved Speed ;) ) I have changed my mind after seeing him in this.Can't wait for it to be released on DVD here in Australia, definately one for my collection!"
2,Not the greatest,"I was surprised that this movie was recommended to me. It had moments of humor, but all in all I was left feeling disappointed. Not to mention that I felt embarassed watching this with my mother since there's full on frontal nudity--and it ain't pretty! It was also totally unnecessary, which just left me wondering WHY??The story was okay, but I had a hard time believing the characters motives. Why are these people becoming couples? It didn't seem real and the writers/director didn't seem to care."
4,My first viewing of this film...,"...is that it seemed a little jumpy compared to AS Good As It Gets or many of Keaton's other movies (all heady to me), but the numerous funny scenes make up for it and Keaton's comic side is perfect until you hit the bedroom where I detected hints of an exaggerated Clooney and Pfeifer in One Fine Day and Hanks and Ryan in You've Got Mail. Unlike other reviewers I don't find the younger lover totally unbelievable but they did fool me. I agree that McDormand was under used in this film. Keaton seems to never let her characters really touch her emotionally (as in her Lifetime movie On Thin Ice) unlike Nicholson but the two balance each other out well in this movie. I couldn't wait to see them together and I wasn't disappointed. I must warn you, without spoiling the movie,that conservative Hollywood has decided to take a walk on the wild side!"
2,Something's Gotta Give an Explanation for Overblown Reviews,"What IS all the fuss about? Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson playing an immature, self-absorbed jackass. Diane Keaton wastes her talent over-acting. The frustrating thing about this movie is that it might have been very good if only it had been directed correctly and the script had been even marginally believable (for comparison see ""As Good As It Gets"" or even ""About Schmidt."") This is a boring movie designed to make two wonderful actors available in a ""romantic comedy"". And it might have worked if the powers that be hadn't depended on the star power of Nicholson and Keaton to carry the story.Don't bother. If you want Nicholson as an older man falling for a real woman of his age, get ""Terms of Endearment."" Dont buy this mess."
2,NOT NEW,The video was sold as NEW but had no plastic seal and seemed to have been opened! DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED SINCE IT WAS A GIFT!
3,She Made Me Watch It!,"""She made me watch it."" That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I had already practiced my eye-rolling by the time the opening credits began. Nicholson once again throwing his hat into the ""I'm old but can learn new tricks"" role, Keaton whom I've never really been fond of - I predicted a hurlfest!Thankfully, I was gigglingly surprised...not bowled over...just surprised. They story worked, except for some cringe-producing, predictable ""schmoopie"" dialog. Still, this wasn't too sweet for my palate! And, unlike the why-was-this-made Because I Said So (ugh!), I found Keaton not only un-annoying, but also (dare I say) HOT! She was costumed appropriately for her age and was someone I WOULD want to walk on the beach with.Can't quite push it up to 4 stars, but if you guys out there need to ""check the Chick Flick Box,"" some night, you might actually live through this one."
3,Not what I imagined!,"The story is good, but I feel that the acting was ... well, horrible! The acting was alright up to where Erica Barry falls apart because of Harry, but then it just fell apart. Renting this movie would be a lot better then buying it. Then if you like it well enough buy it!"
2,Too Young for This?,"Perhaps at 34 I am too young to 'get' this movie. I was hoping for a great romantic comedy, but found this one fell flat. Not even in the same universe as As Good as It Gets. After Jack Nicholson's character is stranded at Diane Keaton's house, I just lost interest. I didn't think he was anyone's dream man, and their love scene was frankly more than a little embarrassing. And the ending! Let's just say I find it very hard to believe a 60-something leopard would change his spots."
1,Definatly for an older crowd!,"This movie was most definatly not made for the audiences under 30 years of age. My friends and I call it ""old people porn"" because old people do it with young people, then old people do it with old people, and then the old people do it with young people again. Not very appealing. The full frontal nudity of Diance Keaton was totally unnecessary. Not recommended."
1,Could have been ok....if it was EDITED PROPERLY!!,"Wow....I was so excited when the movie started...after the dancing harveys, but then it died. And died. And died again. To the point where I wished that a carachtar would die so it would end. If only this movie had had a plot....like 12 storylines that don't meet in the middle. If it had been bad, I could have left in the beginning and gotten 2 hours of my life back. The worst thing since ""It's Pat-The Movie"". YUK!!"
2,Cringe-worthy,"Jack's Jack (again), Keanu Reeves is still the worst actor in the history of cinema, and Diane Keaton's over-the-top performance is an embarassing study in ham-handed vanity.Frances McDormand's brilliant, but underused. Oh yeah, and this silly little ode to ego is, like, five hours long. Enjoy."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"Long, meandering, and at times downright boring, I just can 't see why this movie was so hyped. Yes, Diane Keaton does look great for her age, or any age, but Jack Nicholson has gotten fat and I found myself grossed out during the scene when they first went to bed. I didn't see the chemistry. And her with Keanu Reeves, I dont' know, it was a stretch. I was also disappointed to see a strong female character like that reduced to a blubbering, bawling idiot after knowing the Jack Nicholson character for only one week (and not even liking him for much of it). This movie had a few cute moments but I wouldn't rank it among the stellar romantic comedies."
2,This is where I came in...,"Isn't this the same movie as 'Terms of Endearment'? It has the same plot, same characters: Older/middle-age Teenage Man; meets mean, isolating, menopausal middle-age Woman with daughter and they probably live together ever-after. Even the actors are the same. Jack Nicholson plays the obnoxious guy and kooky Shirley McClain/Diane Keaton plays the crazy woman (Diane and Shirley are the same person, you know that right?) and some up and coming brunette tries to stay alive between those two old hams."
2,"hollywood flaccid, however funny at times","This is a pretty lame comedy, not much more than formula junk, though there is some good writing and the actors are truly fine. Alas, nothing new emerges, and the thought that the Nicolson character cd learn and grow - not only at his age but given his character - is ridiculous and ultimately ruins the impact of the film. It is too bad, because Keaton and Nicolson are such graet actors that they cd have done something original, even pathbreaking. Instead, it is just less rather than more."
3,Not as good as all the hype,"1) Nicholson was funny as usual. His acting can't go wrong.2) Yes, Keaton was very good...but best actress? I'm not sure.3) Reeves tried to act more lively and less monotone...I appreciated the effort. Though I didn't feel the chemistry between him and Keaton.4) Directing was well done.5) Dialogue and writing was good.6) I thought the end was handled a bit too easy in regards to bringing closure. Can't say more without giving things away.OVERALL: A good movie, not great or on par with As Good As It Gets by Nicholson. Definitely worth renting before owning I think."
4,Funny and Entertaining for Adults,"This movie is well cast and well acted; the cast headed up by Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves, and Diane Keaton does a splendid job which permits the viewer to develop a concern for the characters and a desire that all will work out well for each of them.There are a lot of laughs as well as touching situations to which many will be able to relate. The movie is well paced and seems to go by quickly. There is beautiful scenery which always contributes to the enjoyment of the movie.Although funny and entertaining for mature adults I can in no wise recommend this movie for the entire family. It presents ideas and situations which are not suitable for children and does not promote high moral values."
5,Wonderful Film,This movie was so fun for my entire family. Probably the most enjoyable movie of the year. The storyline was very solid and the characters were captivating. I laughed out loud while watching this film and you will too. This is a must buy for a Jack Nicholson fan and for any fan of excellent comedy that actually has an excellent storyline to go along with the laughs.
4,Nicholson and Keaton should have worked together before,"It's funny to see some actors don't feel the passing of time. Besides, even if they hadn't worked before, they seem to have a great complicity even in their 60's. Excuse for talking about age of people.They make laugh and they show tenderness, too. Of course Diane Keaton has a really suitable role but Nicholson is still a bad-tempered, irresistible, old man as in many of his late films.Nevertheless, the story is really fine and amusable. It's not another romantic comedy but a soap box opera!The only thing is: was it necessary to show both actors almost nude? It's a marvellous scene, but sure they asked for a great amount of money for doing that."
4,Very funny,Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson have perfect chemistry together.It is one of the funniest flicks I've watched in a long time.
3,Enjoyable,"SGG is an enjoyable movie. Nicholson and Keaton make a nice couple, but I dont think Keaton deserved an Oscar no. The movie is a little long, but it's a fun romantic comedy...esepcially for the older folks."
3,"OK, but","'Something's Gotta Give' purports to be a comedy and romance that mixes two opposites that eventually attract. It does do that, but is WAY too long, involves too many personality and plot changes to be believable, and makes the viewer wonder why any woman would spend five minutes with a mostly overly shallow, sometimes positively unnerving Nicholson."
1,predictable and boring,"jack nicholson should stop making movies. he plays the same character over and over again. some people say he plays himself. oh horror.not worth watching, what a waste of time."
3,"A cliche to the end, all be it a good cliche.","If I wanted to make a traditional romantic comedy for adults, I'd set it in or around New York, I'd have sophisticated and financially well off characters, I'd thrown in a little british farce, maybe some slightly dated but cool music, and end it at a very romantic location. In a nut shell this is ""Something's Got to Give"", it's also ""You've Got Mail"" and it's ""Sleepless in Seattle"" as well as a host of other popular romantic movies. What sets ""...Give"" apart is not the story or the direction so much as the acting. Everyone in the cast does a superb job, but it's the chemistry between Nicholson & Keaton that makes this cliche of a movie work. Maybe it's because they play shadows of themselves or maybe it's because the trust each other, I don't know. I just want then to make more movies together."
2,SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE,Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z A REAL SLEEPER. BRING YOUR PILLOW. YOU'LL NEED IT! EVEN NICHOLSON COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE.
3,Something's Gonna Give - My Bladder for one!,"The stars are great in this movie, and its them that deserves all credit for this movie! Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are wonderful, and so natural and likeable. Too bad they are in a Nancy Meyers movie that drags on and on and on and on and on. You know how it will end hours before it does! And yet it rambles on for over two hours! Reminds me of another Nancy Meyers film WHAT WOMEN WANT. She needs an editor to keep the pace going! Every guy in the theatre ran to the bathroom once the credits started! I believe the women were just as desperate to get there! Please please hire somebody to edit your next movie!!!!"
4,Great Expectations Fulfilled,"This was a great movie. Stars of the movie was Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. While the ending was a bit on the unrealistic side. I've enjoyed how they address the issues of aging,sexuality,divorce,starting over with a whole lot of humor. This gets my vote."
5,Great Nicholson and Keaton performances!,"Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are superb in this movie. While the plot is a bit old, their acting makes the movie worth watching. Great comedy!"
2,Sex and the City plus 20 years,"It's Carrie and Big, 20 years later.It's a 2-plus hour movie that needed to be 1-1/2 hours. While MONSTER has one writer and director and was tight as a drum, this movie has one writer and director who is self-indulgent. A waste of talent. OK if you have nothing better to do. Or see MONSTER and the finest acting I can remember ever seeing."
2,Bad movie,"This is the first movie I have watched from Diane Keaton, what a terrible actress! I don't know how she got so famous, maybe this was the only bad movie she made! Anyway, 2 stars goes to Jack Nicholson!"
5,Something's Gotta Give,Watched this many times on cable before buying the DVD from Amazon. My husband and I really like this movie.
2,was this movie ever boring...,"I should just say that I can't stand Keanu Reeves. He is such a horrible actor. I didn't think this movie was funny, and it dragged on for quite a while. spend your money elsewhere."
3,Overrated...BIG TIME!!!,"I desperately wanted to see ""Something's Gotta Give"" on the big screen over the holidays, but I never made it, and ended up waiting for the DVD. What a major over-hype by the critics: totally contrived and cliched, not the LEAST bit witty, and as much as I love Jack Nicholson, quite frankly he is WAY past his romantic-comedy days.There are a few (very few) funny scenes. Diane Keaton is quite good, as if she could ever turn in a lousy performance, but worthy of an Oscar nomination???? No way. Rent it, and you be the judge. In fact, the oddest thing about this movie is that the most believable acting in it comes from Keannu Reaves!This film will really make you wonder about professional movie reviewers."
1,This movie is just awful.,"Prompted by the worst movie that i've seen in a long time, this is the first review that I've written. One star is two too generous. I'm embarrassed for Keaton and Nicholson. What an absolute waste of a couple of bucks at the rental place. Save your time and money. Bad bad bad."
1,Achingly pathetic,You see all the 1 star reviews? Believe 'em. Watching paint dry would be more interesting. Steer clear of this baby.
4,Gift for a friend,"This film is my close friend's favorite movie ever, so I decided to get her the DVD as a Christmas present. She was delighted."
1,"A challenge to ""Showgirls"" for best bad movie","What does it take to be a good bad movie? Lot's of talented people getting together and making every mistake and bad choice possible.By that criteria ""Something's Gotta Give"" is the first movie I've seen in a long time that could give ""Showgirls"" a run for its money for best bad movie. All the elements are here - lots of talent (Nicholson, Keaton, Peet), a boringly predictable plot, and some of the most excrutiating writing I have heard in a major motion picture. Nicholson is barely acting at all, while Keaton is trying to act, but failing - miserably. When the best performance in your movie is given by Keanu Reeves, you know something spectactuarly bad has occurred.My advice - rent this movie, get a bunch of your friends together, get rip-roaring drunk, and a good time will be had by all."
1,Trite Star Vehicle,"This trite, formula-governed movie should be an embarassment to Keaton and Nicholson, or their agents, who generally find better scripts. Obvious, predictable, its saving grace is Keanu Reeves' performance as the perfect American male. Anyone who enjoys membership in the latter category should watch this movie to see how it's done. Looking for a good film? Look elsewhere."
3,she goes off with the wrong guy!,"The movie is SO frustrating. Such a nice idea, such a good set up, something interesting and wonderful to explore -- giving us a peek at older characters -- but Keaton's character goes off with the wrong guy! Reeves is funny, sweet, smart, and a hell of a lot sexier than Nicholson. I mean, the scene where he brings her the flowers! Or where he chases her around the corner into the bedroom! But Keaton's character is just a little too neurotic to accept something so wonderful as a guy who has the maturity from the start ... still, there are some good lines, some good scenes. The daughter and the sister are fabulous."
1,Simply horrendous,"Is this film meant to be uplifting? You've got to be kidding. In what universe would it be considered acceptable for a successful woman to choose the puffy, lecherous commitmentphobe who beds her, doesn't call and humiliates her, over the loving, cute doctor who happens to be 20 years her junior? Is it considered to be ""mature"" to be with a man your age who neglects you and is incapable of forming a serious relationship? And oh, by the way, you met the old guy when he was dating YOUR DAUGHTER. Ecccchhh. And to nominate Diane Keaton for this role, which is basically a yuppie Annie Hall retread, for an Academy Award is simply a joke. See this movie at your peril."
1,Yawn,"I thought this movie was dull, silly (not in a good way), and predictable. I was amazed that two actors who always managed to charm me, had so little ability to do so in this pitiful film."
2,Did people watch the same movie that I did?,"It started off just fine. It got a little boring going along the storyline but I like Nicholson and I generally enjoy Keaton. HOWEVER, I thought Diane Keaton was an actress? When she was crying, in the film, I was more than annoyed! I turned it off completely. She's supposed to be an actress!!! I was very disappointed in her acting in this film and for that I give the movie 2 stars as I thought it could have been much better."
1,Big Disappointment,"I wasn't expecting the best romantic comedy in the world but I was hopeful that this one might be reasonably entertaining. Instead, I found it embarrassing and deadly. I am not a fan of Diane Keaton but I didn't expect her to be this bad. Her character behaved like a melodramatic teenager and the crying scene was idiotic and interminable. Jack Nicholson was his usual lecherous, boozy-looking over-the-hill lothario and it was very hard to believe that any woman of any age would go so nutsy over him, especially with Reeves waiting in the wings (also an incredible premise in these circumstances). Even Frances McDormand, who is always good, could not do much to help out as her character was severely underwritten. It was a relief when this movie was over."
1,"trite, ridiculous, and stupid!","This movie was as dull as dull gets! Sorry Jack, you're just not convincing as a charming old fart who can ""reel-in"" the twenty-somethings with the fight and personality (lack there of) of a farm raised trout! Diane Keaton's character, supposedly a sharp counter-point to her competition (youth, beauty and naivette) was unconvincing. Instead of genuine wit and eruditeness, the script gave her trite and expected lines. We, the audience, were treated to multiple scenes of Diane et.al., laughing at her witticisms which she silently mouthed as the music swelled. I suppose we were supposed to believe that at these times at least, Diane was clever. At least Diane isn't a plastic-surgery addict -- it was nice to see a mature woman looking her age!"
3,Nicholson and Keaton are a hoot,"Of course it's light and silly, not a heavyweight film at all. But you won't find a couple with more authentic chemistry, on all levels, than Jack and Diane. They pull off the honest, snappy dialogue perfectly. They're just a zany pair who clearly enjoy each other, probably off-screen as well."
1,"Kept saying to myself ""Something's Got to Give""","This movie started off strong and quickly went downhill. This movie felt like it was 5 hours long and I kept saying ""Something's got to give""! Will these people just get together already so I can get out of here. The first 15 minutes were interesting, but the rest just dragged on forever. You know going into the movie they were going to end up together, but all this back and forth it's just so redundant."
4,Excellent Film,If you like chick flicks and traveling I recommend that you see this movie.It's simply an excellent film if that's what your into.
2,too long,I thought the movie dragged on for way too long. Diane Keaton's crying scene was obnoxious and I couldn't wait for the movie to end.
5,An Excellent Resource,"In my work as a professional proofreader for an advertising agency, I find myself consulting this manual frequently. It has a good mix of rules and examples. I always find the answer I am looking for. This is the highest praise you can give to any handbook of this type."
3,A Clockwork Orange wannabe...,"...with poor sound quality, and very poor acting at times. The scene styles jump around too much, trying to show too many artistic styles. Selling body parts..drugs... heroine chic disco... attempts at being controversial by questioning the holocaust, mentioning violence and censorship. Don't have your characters read it, make the viewer FEEL it! These ""speeches"" were unpassionate and felt very scripted. There were some good scenes, don't get me wrong, but there wasn't enough flow. Some domination and sex scenes(a plus in My book), but I think they ran out of things to say towards the end and used sex to make the rest of the movie more interesting."
4,Good but,"For someone who has released cd's like ""Bottom Line"" and ""after yesterday"", this one may come as a slight disappointement. Although a good record, it's not in par with his best efforts and most of it is overproduced. It's still Gorka, the great songwriter, though. The song are as good as ever."
1,"Unstable, our son fell twice and hurt himself with these sandals. junk!","These sandals are very unstable and do not tie securely. The fit was perfect for our son, but they always seem to give on on one side when walking. He almost tripped several times, and fell twice actually hurting himself. We didn't realized these sandals were the cause and threw them in the trash right away. They might work for some, but they were a bad purchase for us. There are better sandals available, would not recommend these sandals."
1,Vulgar? Try Horrible,this movie was simply horrible...the acting was horrible...the storyline was force fed...the direction was lackluster...it was painful to watch...stay away...
1,REALLY VULGAR,"This may be the worst movie I've seen in my life (not taking ""Pretty Woman"" into consideration :).Trash at its best. But not good trash which can be funny and entertaining. Here everything's dead serious therefore it's such a trashy trash it should've been thrown into wastes the day it had been shot. What surprised me was the acting which was pretty decent, but everything else - so stupid, I can't understand what was the purpose of making this movie at all? What were the filmmakers trying to achieve? Why? What for? What were they thinking? I wish I could pick their brains. After this film I realized I should never believe a box-cover. ""Vulgar""'s cover is rather stylish, it attracts attention. Don't you ever believe it! I guess they spent much more money on that cover than on movie production itself.Although I can imagine someone who likes this kind of flicks. Who knows - maybe it's exactly what you need..."
2,Vulgar Display of Power,"Should really be called I Spit on Your Grave 2. This movie didn't offend, disturb or effect me in any way. Vulgar is a very badly acted, badly written and badly directed mess. It's flat, empty and very VERY pale. I didn't feel for Flappy. The script wouldn't let me. The acting is ridiculous... although Brian O'Halleran does a respectable enough job. Bryan Johnson himself added a little zing, I guess. But Kevin Smith's role is both cheap and embarrassing and makes a mockery of every scene he bellyflops into. The rest of the cast (including Jason Mewes and the over-the-top mother) are rock-bottom as well. As for the script... let's just say it REALLY goes downhill after Flappy ""saves the day"". A juvenile and unbelievable turn for the worst, I'd say. Completely ludicrous, since the movie had a pretty decent and gritty start. To be blunt, that scene basically sunk the whole movie. Boy, did it ever tumble after that. Vulgar just fails on so many levels."
1,Time watching this film could be used to not watch this film,"I haven't compiled a real list yet, but this film would definately be up around the top 5 or so worst films I have ever tried to sit through in my entire life. If you can actually get past the horrible acting and the fact that none of the sound actually matches the chartacters who are speaking, and the fact that the story is really unoriginal and unimaginative, you might make it almost to the end of the movie...I didn't."
4,Don't be mislead by View Askew's previous Projects,"Although this movie is produced by View Askew and stars many members of previous View Askew projects don't think this movie is in anyway a comedy or even a black comedy. If you start watching his movie in that frame of mind you surely will hate it.Vulgar is an excelent thriller and psycological drama. Though obviously filmed on a tight buget, the story is very interrestingly put together and Brian O'Halloran's performance as the violated clown can really move you to tears. His portrail really goes through all possible emotions and shows much more depth than any other movie role has alowed him so far (don't get be wrong, I think he is great as Dante in Clerks, but this gives him much more range to display his acting talent.)"
1,An unwatchable unredeemable pile,"Not scary. Not funny. Not original. Not insightful. Not competently shot. Not written well at all. Not informative. Not intelligent. Not spellbinding. Not even mildly interesting. Not an inspired debut or follow-up for anyone involved. Not worth anybody's time.Low budget crap that failed at being anything on its own, so instead it was marketed for its Kevin Smith link. In summary;A protagonist you can't care about, does some stupid stuff, on some crappy sets, while talking to people nobody would care about, using that annoying, pretentiously over-constructed Kevin-Smith-eese vernacular; then does some more stupid stuff with more bad actors playing uninteresting characters, until he arrives at a predictable unrewarding ending, that leaves the viewer wondering about only one thing,....""If I can dig the receipt out of the garbage and return this today,.. can I get cash back?""Why isn't there a ""0"" stars rating?Please. Buy or rent something else."
1,Piece of SH** !!,"This was horrible, horrible, horrible. And I consider myself to be a person who enjoys offbeat, ""dark,"" movies... so it says a lot if I thought it was trash. If I was Kevin Smith, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this cra*. I've lost all respect I ever had for Smith after this... I can't imagine any truly respected director such as Scorsese, Kubrick, or Tarantino delving into this kind of garbage."
5,romantic comedy,"Unlike other viewers, I'd mark Vulgar a burgeoning classic and place it in the ""romantic comedy"" genre along with Bad Lieutenant."
3,Not what I expected but still enjoyed it,I went into this movie looking stricktly for the shock value...I had heard very good things about how messed up it is. It is a disturbing movie but if you are looking for the shock factor it wasnt all there. The acting was decent some of the smaller parts were played pretty poorly but overall the acting was decent. This movie is also very low budgeted which shows in some of the camera work but I think it makes the movie a little more unique. Overall I am on the fence about this movie but I recommend you rent it if you can to checjk it out first becaus it isnt for everyone
1,"Not a Kevin Smith movie, Not very good",I bought this a long time ago and thought it was absolute S***!I love Brian O'Halloran's work in the Kevin Smith movies he has been in but even he couldn't save this movie.This movie is not even funny accidentaly!Only Artificial Intelligence and Napolean Dynamite were worse movies!AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!
1,GOd what was smith thinking,"Normally, i love kevin smith and think movies like dogma are masterpieces. I have read from other movies that kevin smith did not actually write this which would fiqure why it is nothing like any of his other movies. WHile this movie did not offend me, it is dark and disturbing and not for the light of heart. This movie is total crap, why the hell did kevin smith even co produce this? Save yourself the one dollar it costs to rent this and see a classic like dogma or jay and slient bob strike back"
1,very disappointed,"i returned this product, i hit the wrong item i didn not want the unrated version of this movie when i realized i did fot the wrong one i returned it and i got back half of what i paid for it, i dont think i will order from amazon anymore because the return policy sucks."
1,Really Bad movie to say the least...,"I can't imagine why anyone would actually like this movie. It's horrible in a really bad way. It tries to come off as a shock movie but the shock value is just not there. The acting is sub level...I've seen high school plays with better actors in them. I could write 5000 lines on how revolting and disgusting this movie really is...but this will sum it all up. ""Don't watch it!"". Unless your into clown rape, torture and bad acting."
2,wow. . .what was that?!,"If you don't know the basic premise of Vulgar, and you want to be suprised when and if you watch the movie, then stop reading now.""Vulgar"" is based around the brutal rape of a clown who decides to perform gag strip-teases at bachelor parties. When the clown makes it big on TV, his rapist try to blackmail him.I know this sounds bizarre, but that's exactly what this movie is - bizarre. It's not funny, like other View Askew films (although kevin smith and jason Mewes play minor parts in the fim). It's not a terribly interesting story. Just plain weird.I'm usually not one scared off by the strange or different, but this movie had nothing to offer. No humor, no depth, no interesting dialogue. This is the sort of movie that pretenious movie critics like just because it's weird and the story-telling is disconnected (e.g. Magnolia)...."
1,Horrible!,"This is perhaps the worst written film I've ever seen. For a script that is entirely over-written (just watch the mom/son scenes)you still can't understand what is going on, why any of anyones actions are called for, nor the relationships of any of the characters. This movie just captures senseless violence at its peak."
3,Middle of the road,"The Upside -The movie has great dialogue and it's interesting to watch Brian O' Hollaran, Bryan Johnson, Kevin Smith, and all take on very different roles than we're used to seeing them in.The Downside -The hotel room rape scene was WAY too much information. I don't think I'll could ever invite a clown to my kids birthday party ever again."
4,good movie,"vulgar is one of those movies taht you will either like are will not. it is a very dark movie and is not good for everyone. it is one of those movies that will make you sick to your stomcah, but at the end of it i thought it was a really good reveange movie"
4,own it,do not buy this movie because it is a view askew production title. do buy it if u like shock cinema. some very decent acting. some soso.
1,Tell Em Steve Dave,"This movie is almost unwatchable. And this is coming from a huge view askew fan. I even own Drawing Flies. But the only thing good about this disc is the Dogma Documentary that Columbia Tri-Star was too chicken to put out on the Dogma DVD. Some people might like this moviebut I doubt many will. There's not much of a point to it all.After watching the movie I had a weird feeling. BecauseI never got bored watching Vulgar,Nor did I feel a need to eversee it again.Hopefully We can get Kevin Smith to change his mind about the end of Jay and Silent Bob."
4,I loved it.,"I got to see this move at Vulgarthon 2002 and thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of twists and turns and a depth and darkness I hadn't expected before seeing it. The movie is definitely not for everyone. If you have a dark sense of humor (like I do) it is really worth a watch. I believe someone already stated ""maybe you should rent it first"" before buying it."
4,This is not a Kevin Smith movie and not a comedy,"It is by his friend Bryan Johnson and only produced by Kevin. It's not supposed to be funny. If you want a Kevin Smith comedy, steer clear of this. If you want a deep, dark, and very excellent movie, watch it. A lot of people say this is the most disgusting movie they've seen and it made them sick to their stomach. I am someone who turns their head at the gore in horror movies and could never stomach anything like Saw or Hostel, but I had no problem with this movie. It is not physically sickening. It is very disturbing yes, but life is disturbing. If you want a happy cheery flick, then this isn't it, but it is a very good movie thats definetly worth watching. I'm sick of Kevin Smith fans going into this expecting it to be exactly like his movies. I love Kevin Smith movies, but this isn't a Kevin Smith movie so don't go into it thinking it will be anything like his. You have to have an appreciation for dark dramatic movies to enjoy this."
5,One of their best ones yet.,This is an amazingly well done kit. The design of the joints allows it to have a huge range of poses and it maintains it's integrity while doing so. I would highly recommend to also buy the Skygrasper along with this because it comes with the display stand which makes all the difference in displaying it.
4,Made me laugh out loud,"I really appreciate the author's humor in this book. I am dealing with big health issues and relate on many many levels to much of what she talks about. Her wit and self-deprecating humor, combined with her honesty about the stuff that isn't funny makes this book really ring true for me."
2,Offended and Disappointed,"Rodgers writes this book from a Christian perspective, but as a Christian I was offended by the language and explicit nature of this book. She explains love making early in her chemotherapy treatment, and discusses the smell and taste of body fluids in explicit detail. This part was at the beginning portion of the book; I finished the book, and found this to be the most offensive bit. Negative attitude and raw language were scattered throughout, however.This being said, Rodger's story is an honest, provoking one. Her story is interesting and useful. The reader just needs to understand that, as a Christian book, this has some very offensive, unnecessary language."
1,Pages missing,"I received ""Bald in the Land of Big Hair"" book. It was to be a gift. I thought I should read it before giving it to my sister in law, who has cancer. I'm glad I read it. About 50 pages were missing and upon flipping through the rest of the book, another section was duplicated. I did not return the book because it was too much trouble."
1,Warning: This book is sexually explicit!,"The author and her husband's sexual escapades in graphic detail were not needed. As a cancer survivor, I found this very personal information of no value to share with other cancer survivors or anyone else look for an uplifing survivor story."
5,Wish I could give it 10 stars,"This is the very best book on cancer that I have read. Although I am in treatment for breast cancer, and Joni had lymphoma, her book was the closest book I have read to portray the many facets of dealing with cancer. I couldn't put it down. No, it's not a pollyanna book that wraps everything up in a neat little package. It is a book of love, passion, joy, spirituality, discovering your strengths and humanity, raising small children while fighting and hoping for the opportunity to see them old enough to remember who you are, the misery and miracles of chemo etc. She is hilarous, informative and very very human. Would suggest this book to any female who has cancer or as a gift for a female going thru cancer. Too good to pass up."
5,A serious and funny while ultimately comforting book,"I loved this book and couldn't put it down. Like Joni, I too had Non Hodgkins B Cell lymphoma in my neck,so I was very interested in her story, but I do think her book appeals to a much wider audience. It's a great story of love,survival, and recovery. I am thankful that she shared her journey in writing and I especially appreciated her insights about how she recovered emotionally. Joni found that prayer, mentoring others, and allowing herself the time she needed were all instrumental in her healing and recovery and I find that very comforting."
4,Insight into a real Mom's life with cancer,This book gives the reader a good look at how difficult if must be to deal with the side effects of cancer treatment while trying to keep a young family together. The help and support of a spouse is vital and a good sense of humor.
5,Shining in Sunny Patch,"""Little Miss Spider at Sunny Patch School"" takes us on another adventure into the life of David Kirk's Miss Spider character when she was just a little girl.Miss Spider, like many kids, is eager to start school. She can't wait to learn her lessons and have fun. She's heard about so many great things happening at school and is eager to try them out.Things start well enough for Miss Spider. She meets the principal and then dives into the day's activities. At first she has fun, but when she doesn't seem to be succeeding at anything, she begins to get worried. She learns that she has a special quality that can always be appreciated.The story, like most other David Kirk books, rhymes and the illustrations are bright and delightful. They're full-page on every other page, with smaller illustrations to accompany the text. ""Miss Spider"" fans will enjoy learning more about the early life of one of their favorite bugs."
4,Caution:,"Most excellent, oil painted illustrations and easygoing rhyme! Nice lesson in helping/kindness. The laminated pages are a real plus for durability. Just misses the mark due to off-color (though true) reference to bugs in ""dung""; children pay special interest--please at least spare us the detailed list of ""students"" with dung-related names!"
5,Another winner from Kirk,"Another great Miss Spider story from David Kirk. My 18 month old son can't get enough. He loves the bright pictures and rhyming story. Miss Spider might not be able to do what other bugs can, but discovers she is very special in her own way. Kirk's stories always have that heart-warming ending that we all love. As a mother, I also appreciate the extra thick pages that hold up to the toddler test!"
2,Obviously A Low Budget Movie!,"Val Kilmer is a retired marine who visits a town to see his marine friend, only to find out that he got brutally murdered with his family. He then transforms into a ""Rambo"" and kills all the bad guys in this town.The script was bad!The direction was so bad! (low budget)It is disappointing to know that some big actors such as Val Kilmer would agree to act in such movies.The only thing that this movie got away with is that it somehow was able to not get you bored while watching it. I think its the action that kept us watching till it ended."
5,Unexpectedly exciting and thought provoking film,"When we got this film, we expected it to be an action movie, something to pass an evening without much thought. We were wrong, this is an action drama with a really interesting take on immigration and the war in Iraq, government and so much more. We really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend it to all audiences."
4,The cripled hero over comes,"Sometimes we really do need a hero.In this case a very unlikely one of a marinewith one leg, hearing loss and a severe head ache!Val Kilmer is over weight and plays the role as a method actor.The bad guy is just the same guy as in most westerns.I give it four stars mostly for political attitudeand the guts to have it during the Bush years."
1,Beyond Bad!!!!!!!,"Wow.. there is so much wrong with this movie, I don't know where to begin.The plot? Um...yeah right.Val Kilmer plays an marine....yeah right! He needs to loose about 50 lbs first!The acting in this movie is awful. It has the feel of a made in the garage movie. The town setting is an old western town, dirt roads, saloon buildings, etc. It looks like they walked on Universal studios with a camera.The movie bounces back and forth from war time, to present, to one minute he is in bed with one woman, then the next minute its another. Kilmer doesn't say much. Just sits and stares.I wouln't watch this if it was the only DVD available on the planet. It was horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Black Male=Visual Extortion,"This movie was quite hysterical despite the fact that this ""Thriller"" was not meant to be a comedy. The main plot consists of two pathetic and desperate con men attempting to blackmail a serial killing doctor who's mental state is way past questionable and the repayment of money to a deranged and violent loan shark.The actors were bad and tried to over compensate for such a poorly written script latent with good intentions not to mention the predictability of occurrences. But through all of the flaws in the script, continuity and cinematography, I found myself irresistibly drawn to reach the conclusion of the movie...thus proving my hypothesis on Black Male=Visual Extortion. It held my interest captive up until the very end. And to see Bokeem Woodbine dressed as a woman is worth the price of rental or purchase. TRUST ME!I suggest viewing the movie if you life offbeat and quirky flicks or just need a good laugh. It sure kept me in stitches!"
3,good for kids; a little slow and unwieldy,"My 7 yr old and his 4 yr old brother really enjoyed this game. As an adult, I don't care for it at all, but I'll split the difference and give it a 3 star rating. It entertains and teaches in its own slow, insipid way. I have a feeling if we'd started with the first installment, vs this third one, it might make more sense."
1,Pegs are too big for boards,"The pegs are too big for all my cribbage boards. The pegs are pretty and nice, but they just don't fit."
1,Items were not represented accurately in description,"While the pegs themselves are good quality they are not of use to three players because only two colors were sent. I ordered and expected three 'assorted' colors but got only two colors. Even after I brought this to the attention of the seller, I received no response to reconcile the mistake. Dissapointing."
3,too flimsy for me,"i found that the only way this bag LOOKS good is to fill it. - otherwise its like a limp dishrag -- i used it for a few weeks, until i just got my new vitalio vera bag today.......:)"
1,TraditionalChristmasSongsShouldNotBeScrewedUpJustToMakeABuck,"Nothing worse than taking a traditional Christmas song and messing it up by any genre. I just heard Merry Texas Christmas, Y'all on the radio and I am about sick to my stomach.Next thing we know someone will come out with a rap album called ""Deck the Ho's"" -- no difference than this."
4,Great to have this rarity on DVD!,"It's wonderful that this previously super-rare title is finally coming to DVD! I have a bootleg VHS from ages ago. It is a provocative and sad documentary from 1981 that tells of the late,great Pier Paolo Pasolini's life,art and, ultimately, his tragic murder in 1975.Very well done; features actors and friends from his films and the literary world.Beware though, it DOES show graphic photographs of his disfigured, battered corpse in close up detail. If you have heard of Pasolini's fate, but never actually witnessed it, you may want to spare yourself the horrific sight. (If you're a fan and would rather remember him as he was in life.)"
4,I LIKED THE TIN,IT WAS GREAT TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE GAME IN THE TIN SO THE CARDS STAY PRESERVED. THE GAME IT SELF IS SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY.
3,saved cards?,When you save cards from one round do you get dealt less than10 for the next or do you get to play with morethan10?
4,10,"Hard to find in stores but, I game that all families should want to and love to play. This is a wonderful family game for all ages."
5,Fun,Phase 10 is an exciting game that can be enjoyed by families. Also the tin allows for preservation and storage of the game for long lasting fun.
1,"OPEN PACKAGE, MISSING ITEMS, DOES NOT LOOK NEW","I recently bought a PG-56 from ""miss-mdm"" (the seller). The product did not arrive in the right conditions. The packaging was open and there were missing some ""included"" items, the bag (pouch) was missing, the drum clip was missing (sold separately in AMAZON at $15), and the XLR cable does not seem to match the original SHURE-quality cables, (the canon connectors are cheap). Taking into consideration the obviously mishandled package I would even dare to believe the mic is not completely brand-new, some tiny dents in the Mic may also suggest that...Terrible Choice, the mic seems to work fine, but the rest was a awful surprise! I have been buying from Amazon for years and it is the first time I receive and article in such condition!!"
4,I like it!,"I've seen my brother and sister playing paper and pencil versions of Sudoku for some time. I tried an online version of the game, but it only allowed me to store one possible number and on harder puzzles I needed to store more than that. I picked this up at Walmart and am very happy with it. I can store as many possibilities as I need. There are five or six different levels of difficulty. I haven't dared try the Hard and Very Hard levels yet. Medium is still plenty challenging for me. It runs fine on my computer with Vista. My only complaint is that it takes quite a bit of time to play a single game, and sometimes I need to quit and come back to it later, and there doesn't seem to be a save function."
4,nice table,"This is a great little table that holds 8 wine bottles. It was easy to assemble, and my only complaint is that shipping was almost as much as the table itself."
3,Red Camp?,"As a book it is a pleasant little book. As someone familiar with The Red Camp,the author worked so hard disguising the people and places...she did a great job. I bought it as a local, and I wasn't."
5,Marcus the Master,"If you haven't seen Marcus live then this DVD will make you a believer that he is a ""master"". I love his style. There isn't another like him. You should hear what Stanley Clarke says about him. A must have for any Bass Player."
4,Get to know Marcus!!!,I thought this concert was great!!! I really enjoyed the interviews where I learned more about who Marcus Miller (the person) is. I now know that Marcus is more than just that slap/pop bass playing guy!!!
1,"unable to rate item, I never received the item.","I'm not able to rate this item at this, because I never received the item."
5,Concise Overview,"I really enjoyed this series, and actually showed it to my high school senior math class in 8-10 minute installments. However, unless the viewer is somewhat familiar with the higher math topics, it leaves unanswered the question, ""what practical needs led to these discoveries."""
5,Brilliant,"This was wonderfully engaging and informative. Though they didn't understand all of the material, even my 5, 6, and 8 year olds were eager to watch it."
5,Great overview on math!,"This series is very enjoyable, even for people who typically don't enjoy math. The subject matter is presented so that the viewer begins to understand not only math concepts, but also some of the human drama behind calculus, for example."
4,I loved this book.......,"Diane Ackerman writes with such beauty and her examples are so rich and invigorating. I refer people to her books all the time to experience word artistry in non fiction writers.In fact, the word ""Play"" was getting on my nerves with regularity until I read this book which really outlines the Sacred aspect of play.After reading, I look at everything involving Play from a different plane. My two year old delights in Mommy's delight! How is THAT for trading spaces!I can't understand the low rating this book has had so far. Some people who reviewed it must be cranky.Buy it, revel in it, play with the content."
3,"Captivating. It lacked the power to realy ""MOVE"" me though.","Drawn out and excessively wordy. I loved it, but it was reminicent of a briefly popular Pepsi-Cola product. It was called Clear-Pepsi. My children thourghly enjoyed it. They could have thier cola and not be badgered about it. But let's face it, even though it looked like seltzer and smelled like iron heavy water, it left you with this strange unpleasent aftertaste. Like you know there should be more..."
2,deep disappointment,"I've enjoyed Ackerman's other books, but this one failed to engage me. It did seem like she stitched a bunch of diary pages together and sent it to her publisher. She's a beautiful poet, but this time her thoughts seemed scattered with only the most lackaidasical attempt on her part to synthesize them.Usually, I enjoy her style, but I was especially distracted this time trying to keep the relationship between her personal anecdotes and the deep play theory straight.I have to admit, though, the paperback version has one of the most gorgeous covers I've ever seen. It's sad when more effort appears to have gone into a book's design than its content, though."
4,playful work of evolution,"Ackerman suggests humanity evolves as a result of ""deep play,"" and her eponymous term for meditative, creative activity is described here both in cultural history and personal memoir. The writer explores a range of interests, from the role of the bicycle in the emancipation of nineteenth century women to the etymology of ""play"" itself-an earlier, near-opposite meaning of the word was much like ""pledge."" At its best, this is a guide toward her ""exalted zone of transcendence over time."""
5,Exene shines on this one,"This is a masterpiece that many people don't know about. It is beautifully written, performed, recorded and produced from start to finish. If you are a fan of Exene, then you are a fool if you don't own this one. 'Nuff said ..."
5,Want to buy this game,i really need to buy this product so i want as soon and as much as possible.because it'll help me a lot
4,The previous review,"I hate to belittle a Top 100 Reviewer but did he even look at the tracks and the label for this CD? It is not Rhino - it is Capitol. Yes, the CD titles are the same - Best Of Gary U.S. Bonds.The tracks are not in a different order - they are different altogether except for a song or two done live.I have the Rhino CD and am looking at it right now. It has 18 tracks from his Legrand period. The 10 track CD here is a Best of from his period with Bruce Springsteen and Little Steven in the 80's.Shortly there will also be a CD containing all the tracks from 2 Bruce Springsteen assisted LP's - Dedication and On the Line. It contains all of what is on here (except for the live tracks) plus a lot more - 21 tracks. For someone interested in Gary U.S. Bonds in the 80's, it is a must.There is also a brand new 2004 CD from him called Back in 20."
4,We were chasing the Dragon!,"This album kicks ASS and they're named after one of my favorite Dio albums so that's always cool.This album is an explosive mixture of modern power metal and great old school metal. Sure the lyrics are cheesy as hell and the ballad plain SUCKS! (this track is the only reason I didn't outright give this album five stars, it's THAT bad.) but overall this album is fun as hell.This album also features Gus G. from Firewind, Mystic Prophecy and Nightrage so you know the guitar work is going to be top notch but all of the other musicians also shine here. Nordstrom proves he is as efficient a guitarist as he is a producer.If you like straight foward kick ass fun metal check out Dream evil."
4,pretty d*mn good for a debut...,"yeah, I have to say that for a debut release, this is pretty solid. The first song, ""Chasing the Dragon"" reminds me of Dokken BIG-TIME. ""In Flames you Burn"" keeps up with KAMELOT or STRATOVARIUS any day. ""Save Us"" gets groovin' and has that 80's feel a little bit. The only songs that really bug me are ""Losing You"" which is a little to sappy for me, and ""Heavy Metal Jesus"""
4,The best Dream Evil,"This is the best Dream Evil cd ever. This cd has so many good songs ""Chasing the Dragon"" the song that got me really started on power metal. ""In Flames you Burn"" is another good song. But the best song on this cd is ""The Chosen Ones"". On the whole this is a good cd I must say I've heard better power metal but still this one ain't shabby. Most people I talk to say the second one is better but disagree this one is better by far. The sound is good. The lyrics are well writen."
1,Very boring,"This book advertises that it is: The Techno Thriller that out-Clancy's Clancy. There is NO techno, NO thriller, confusing plot, inexplicable murders. Not a good book!!"
2,Ending Was Found Wanting,"This book was very intriguing at first glance. The story line was very enthralling because it involved multiple different people and their secret reasons as to why they are cheating. Also, it explores why the main character, Simon Gray, was helping the cheaters if he was as good of a boy that he said he was, and as good as everyone else said.What really killed this book for me was the ending. The ending didn't solve any problems in a satisfying way. The greedy characters got what they wanted, and then the quiet good girl that was always passed over and was just the friend finally had a chance, and he, yet again, passed over her. This ending just begged for another story to if everything, but that story shall never come."
2,Shades Of Simon Gray,"I didn't find this book to be very interesting. Mind you, I'm only halfway through. But given the fact that I bought the book and started reading it at the beginning of August (2003) and it now being the end of March (2004) and I've only gotten to about chapter four, and have also read numerous other books in the time between - this book was definetly not for me. Sure, the author has a good style of writing, a good way of describing things, and all that. But to me, it just wasn't appealing. I can't say nothing major happened, but just the way everything worked out around what happened, it wasn't exciting..."
5,Page Turner!,"This was such an exciting book! From the begining, the story is so skillfully unraveled, it was hard to put the book down. Joyce McDonald captures her readers with the weird events happening in the small New England town from the mysterious accident that leaves Simon in a coma to the various plagues of frogs, birds and disease, you just have to know how it will all turn out. The characters are so real, sorting out their fears and concerns, you can't help but worry for them. This is a great read!"
5,Mud Bugs,Excellent collection of New Orleans influenced music. Listening will give you a craving for mud bugs and blackened alligator tail. Mmmmm.
5,"Nat King Cole, Jumpin' at the Capitol",This is a wonderful memoir to the Great Nat King Cole and his various affiliated musicians. This album really swings and perfectly conveys the mood of that Golden Era
1,Very poor radio,"I am in the military, currently deployed and purchased this radio to use as a second form of communication among our squad. Although the set works, its range is smaller, its batteries do not last as long, and its about twice the size as other Motorola sets. In fact both of my radios often miss traffic that everyone else picks up. I would recommend looking at another Motorola radio before you waste your money on this."
4,Nice radios for traveling,"I recently got these radios for Christmas and I am pretty impressed. They are easy to use with very clear sound. I previously had a set of Motorola 2 mile radios and in comparison, the T7100Rs work 100x better. I just got back from a vacation in Disney World and found these radios to be extremely handy. In the group of people we were traveling with we had my two 7-miles, and 4 2-miles. No matter where you were in the park you could always hear who had the 7-mile radios which wasn't always the case with the 2-miles. The only draw back was that they were just a little bit bitter than the normal Motorola radios. If you are buying these radios expecting to use them over any 7 mile terrain, don't. When they test the distance, they do so in some flat part of the dessert. I think these radios are great and would recomend them to any casual user wanting a little extra range."
2,So-so radio,"As other reviewers have said, this two way radio is not worthy of the Motorola name. The only reason I'm still using mine is that I bought it for $25 (after tax) as part of a damaged two radio package. This radio will go through a fresh set of batteries very quickly, and certain channels can only receive from FRS radios (channels 1-7).The T7200 would be a better buy, if you can still find it. The T7400 is similar to the T7100 without its shortcomings, but still can't use channel 1-7."
5,Bait & Switch,"Product is good, business practice is questionable at best. Though pompously advertised at $84.99, no source would agree to furnish it for less than $95 - most at $99.87.Quite frankly, I expect more from Amazon. Shame on you."
5,Roadside Geology,"It is amazingly accurate and if you are interested in Geology you willlearn solid, well written information about this Geology."
5,Roadside Geology,"This book is a necessity when you are traveling the highways and you want to know why . . . why is there lava here, why are the hillsides slanted, why the different colors/levels/etc. along the roadway. Beats taking geology classes, instant knowledge - very helpful, especially when you are new to New Mexico."
4,Roadside Geology,"I ordered this book hoping to discover what interesting rocks, minerals, gems, etc. I might find on a vacation to New Mexico. The book does cover this information, but I'm disappointed that it didn't tell me what to look for, where to look and how to spot likely deposits of interesting minerals while hiking or driving in New Mexico."
3,New Mexico Geology,"Far too technical for the average tourist. Written for geology students, not old geezers slowly travelling through."
1,"review of accordion DVD, chris parkinson","I have taught myself or enhanced my learning using a great variety of instructional DVDs for dance (salsa, west coast swing, ballroom) as well as classical guitar and skeet shooting. This is hands down the worst piece of trash I have ever wasted my funds on. Granted the accordionist is well spoken. The use of written music notation for piano accordion is standard procedure and has been in use for decades. To attempt to ""teach"" PIANO ACCORDION by sight is absurd in my opinion. Cajun? Yeah there are good DVDs for that. Pianoa accordion? Absurd. Want to play the accordion? Learn to read a score like everyone else. I watched this in Afghanistan to compliment the many books I have purchased (Mel Bay, Afred, Santorella) and have been using. After one viewing I literally through this DVD in the dumpster before it was taken to burn pit. Steve Martin, Shindand Air Base"
5,Keeps gettin' better,"I have been listening to this album a lot lately, so I thought I'd check out Amazon to see what other folks were saying. I then discovered that I had at some point given this disc a 3/5. I now wonder what in doG's name I was thinking?! This is a fantastic album. Not only does the album get better as I listen to it more, it really builds up listening to it sequentially. The songs are all at least good (even if Book I'm Not Reading does get old after a while) but Heart and Red Accordian are awesome and really gets me going after getting all depressed with Rear View Mirror."
3,Definitely not her best album...,"I was so disappointed with this album, I gave it away...after the melodic tunes and ripping chords that colored ""Angels Running"", I think I was expecting something more flavorful. I found these tracks to be uninteresting and slightly monotonous. These songs do not show off her talented voice or her incredible guitar-picking. To be clear, I think Patty is a wonderful performer and artist, but I would not recommend this CD. ""Angels Running"" and ""Live in the Square"" are her best works, and to get a better taste for her voice and musical talent, I would recommend them instead."
4,C'était Magnifique,"Georges Franju's masterpiece released in the United States in 1962, is a perfect horror-thriller. The story of Dr. Faustus' efforts to repair what his daughter has lost in a most disturbing way, makes for a great plot. The plot twists and well written storyline toy with several emotions. The viewer contemplates the love of a father for his afflicted daughter, but must also deal with how far he takes that love in helping his daughter. Aiding the great storyline was the manner in which this film was made. The music played every time Louise, the doctor's assistant, appears alerts the viewer of the imminent danger to any young, blonde female in film, and is most effective. Also some of the camera shots of the Christiane, when she wore no mask were most effective as the blurring added a sense of suspense, and mystery to her character. Although the film was in black and white the clarity is still rather remarkable. Overall this is a magnificent film and a must see for any film fan."
5,Don't let the kids watch BLOOD OF THE BEASTS.,Visually haunting and poetic Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE - the story of a guilt riddled surgeon who kidnaps teenage girls to transplant their face onto his disfigured daughter - deserves a space in every true movie lover's collection especially now that Criterion has released this beautiful DVD.Once you purchase the DVD however make sure that the kids aren't around when you check out BLOOD OF THE BEASTS on the extras. Franju's 1949 20-minute documentary is a straightforward unflinching view of a Parisian slaughterhouse. There is one horse murdered and disassembled. One cow hammered in the head and dismembered. A roomful of sweet looking calves decapitated and hacked to pieces then finally about 20 sheep killed and chopped up. The whole thing kinda made me queasy.
3,a haunting tale,"'Eyes without a face' plays out like a lot of 1950's American horror films and B movies. The movie does have more to offer, however, with some particularly beautiful shots at the ending as the mad doctor gets his just deserts. For the most part this movie is just campy fun, however, and if you are looking for a 1959 masterpiece I think you have several other options to pick from."
3,"Engaging, But Far from Great","Obviously, based on user comments here, people LOVE this movie, and there is indeed much to admire. It's got haunting, beautiful visuals and a creepy fun house score by the terrific Maurice Jarre. It flirts with themes such as father/daughter guilt and doctor/God complex, but I guess ultimately my problem with the movie is that it only flirts with these themes; it doesn't fully flesh them out. The film has become eerily prescient in today's social climate in which everyone is insearch of physical perfection--and will do nearly anything to obtain it--but it doesn't really explore this idea and come up with any conclusions about it. The whole film seems like set up for a finale intended to shock with its starkness and brutality, but it comes off instead as merely heavy handed. Not a bad movie by any means, just not a great one either.Grade: B-"
2,Masterpiece ? Eh....,"I do not regard this as a so-called ""masterpiece"". To be blunt, I think it's reputation has been helped along all these years by the fact that it's old, in black-and-white, and in French, giving it an arty feel. Granted, it has some good cinematography, making good use of shadow, and it's quiet passages lend it an air of mystery. But a masterpiece ? No, it is not. I think I was intrigued by it up until the non-climactic end. I was left thinking, ""That's it ??"". I kept expecting a chilly, goose-bumped ending, one that the film's reputation carries with it.I thought the extra documentary, ""Blood of the Beasts"", on the disc was more intriguing to watch."
4,a suspenseful take on Frankenstein,"A Doctor's wife invites beautiful female strangers off the streets of Paris to relax at their mansion. Little do they know, the husband runs a murderous operational clinic inside; grafting skin off dead bodies to save their daughter's face. Some detectives trail closely behind the unsolved crimes after putting together some puzzling clues. What the audience ends up getting is another suspenseful take on Frankenstein and the mad scientist."
5,not your typical french flick,"Excellent film. The criterion version features in the extras a few interviews with the director and a disturbing 22 minute documentary about french slaughterhouses in 1949.This movie has a chilling performance by the head doctor, and amazing special effects for the time it was made. Very stylishly done film. I would recommend it to fans of Psycho."
5,They don't make them like this anymore!,"I saw this film 6 months ago and it is still with me. What a fabulously dark, yet heartwarming tale!"
5,FRANJU'S GOTHIC MASTERPIECE....,"In a French chateau, a famed plastic surgeon tries valiantly time after time to restore his disfigured daughter's face...driven by guilt since he was responsible for the accident that caused it. Georges Franju's 1959 Gothic shocker still retains the power to disturb unlike other similarly themed horror films. It is grislier than others of the period and stunningly photographed in b&w with haunting images (like the mask) that linger with you for days afterward. The surgeon (Pierre Brasseur) and his assistant (Alida Valli) are obsessively devoted to the daughter (Edith Scob) and don't take into account her personal feelings. Young women are lured to the estate, drugged and used for skin grafts as the daughter stands by helplessly, hoping for a new face. A dreamlike quality to the film makes it all the more disturbing and unforgettable. A collector's find without a doubt and a keeper."
3,"A good ""transition"" album","This album came out between the two best MG's albums: ""Hip Hug-Her"" and ""Soul Limbo."" Stylistically, it falls between those albums. The edgier blues/funk style of ""Hip Hug-Her"" and the earlier albums is becoming more refined and jazzy in the style of ""Soul Limbo"" and the albums that followed. The best MG's albums mixed original and cover tunes in almost equal quantities. ""Doin' Our Thing"" is almost all covers and some of the choices (""The Beat Goes On,"" ""Ode To Billie Joe"") are definitely below par. Not a bad album, but pick up ""Soul Limbo"" and ""Hip Hug-Her"" before you pick this one up."
3,Good to start with,"The book is good to start with, it was the first book that was required in my first class or arts (architect) 11A at UCB, it helped a lot in showing different types of drawing styles. It is a good book to start with, its just like an intro for art students."
3,Chamber for a memory palace book order,"This book came in great time, and satisfactory condition. The top right corner of the cover was bent, but I am happy with the order. Thank you so much for being prompt and legit, and conducting business in a desirable manner.-Matt"
4,What Bastet Is,"Bastet is an expansion of Werewolf the apocalypse. This book contains everything you need to play a were-cat and were-hyena. The werecats include: Jaguars, leapords, lions, tigers, cheetahs, lynx, puma, egyptian cats, and faerie cats. This book contains Much more on the cats than the player's guide does, however, there is still no information on any other kind of cat... like ANY of the little cats. Oh well... This book is still great and does contain new fetishes, rites, and totems (called jamak) that are unique to the werecats."
3,"Good product, bad customer service","Scooter runs great and was quick and easy to assemble.As with most rechargeable batteries, we ran the battery down for the first two weeks until it was completely dead (in order not to create a bad ""memory"" as I've run into on my cell phone). We plugged it back in about a week later and the batter wouldn't even recharge at all. The company said the battery needs to be kept plugged in when not in use and leaving it dead for a week ruined it. Never heard of such a thing before, but the seller charged over a hundred dollars to get a new battery on a three week old purchase because I voided the warranty by not properly charging constantly. Seems a little strange to me, thus I can only have 3-stars."
3,present,"Hey,My parcel arrived in a good time frame and not damagedso very happy about this. But I bought it for a present sodon't have any idea as to what its likeVery happy with the service."
5,The One From Kirkbride,"I have read that some are buying the NKJV Thompson-Chain Reference Bible and getting a Bible of lower quality this time. I didn't know what it was all about until I bought one for sale at a bookstore one time. After noticing that the pages where glued instead of sewn, I investigated (they can't be messing with my Thompson)! Anyway,here is what I found out. If you want the quality made one you have to get one that comes from the original publisher Kirkbride Publishing company. They sold the right to Nelson Publishers to publish the Thompson Chain as well at a lower price. The one from Nelson Publishers (ask before you order) is the lower quality, but the one from Kirkbride is the higher quality. I pray that this has helped. Pastor Aaron Gravett"
4,A very good book,This book has many great pictures to give the beginners inspirations to pursue this great hobby.
3,Club Trini review,"Late Night Live by Club Trini is a mostly instrumental album of calypso music. It was recorded live a the Margaritaville Cafe in New Orleans. If you are really into calypso music, you'll love this album. If calypso is not for you, you better pass. In my opinion, the album is completely worth buying just for the wonderful cover of ""No Woman, No Cry"" by Jimmy Buffett and Club Trini. The calypso version is awesome!"
4,Great Songs and Great Musicians,"This is a wonderful album. It's great to hear these guys, normally confined to being Jimmy Buffett's backup band (aside from all their side projects), get a chance to shine together. This is a tropical album, but some of the songs are very jazzy, which is guitarist Peter Mayer's background. One of the songs (Soltar) invokes Santana, especially in Peter's tasty guitar solo and Hammond organ work of Mike Utley.The songs range from dance in the streets party music to lazy relaxing poolside vibes for a sunny summer day. The album was recorded live at Margaritaville Cafe in New Orleans, so the crowd interaction is cool and the jams are authentic. The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that Jimmy Buffett pokes his head in for a few songs and just doesn't fit the vibe. His vocals detract from the great Nadira's on ""Cairo"" and, while ""No Woman No Cry"" is good, he doesn't fit there either. Sorry to you guys who liked him on this album, but he didn't belong here."
1,Refused product from seller,"I refused delivery of this item, in addition to a duplicate of the item packaged with it (which was ordered in error via 1-Click) because the seller would not acknowledge my three email requests to change the quantity. The first email I sent to the seller was less than 12 hours after ordering. The first email I received from the seller was 3 days later, informing me that TWO items were being sent.I am STILL waiting for credit on my account for BOTH items that were returned... a total of $21.88."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"My television, after only a few short years, is now stuck in the demo mode. Apparently this is a common, but unfixable, problem with this set. You won't be able to change channels, control the volume, or get the set out of demo mode. Now it is a 200 lb piece of garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS SET NEW OR OTHERWISE."
5,"Larry Brown a genius, Big Bad Love a masterpiece","Larry Brown is a genius who combines the rich Southern tradition of Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner with the intensely honest introspection of Charles Bukowski and Jim Thompson. Nearly always moving, often darkly hilarious, always involving, Big Bad Love is a masterpiece, ten stories of mind-shatteringly powerful fiction."
3,good book but not great,"A good book, but not great, passes the time when bored.Buy used or get from the library not worth full price."
2,I was disappointed...,"...because I'm a big fan of Larry Brown--especially his first collection of short stories, ""Facing the Music."" This second collection didn't seem to offer anything new--the best stories cover themes and ideas already presented in the first collection, and the worst stories (like the 40 page centerpiece, ""Discipline"") are experimental fiction gone awry. If you haven't read ""Facing the Music"" or ""Joe,"" you're missing out on one of our best contemporary writers--both of those books merit 5 stars in my opinoin, but this one's a pass."
5,to doug vaughn,"writing like this isn't taught, or learned; it's born from living and absorption.i'm the guy who's also ""a reader from purchase, ny."" and this Brown character is a master."
2,Not too good,"Although these did the job, I found them very awkward. As I was trying to put make-up on, I kept hitting the frames. They need to make the frames lower and smaller so your hands don't hit them."
5,Nurture your soul!,"The book was full of wonderful, easy to accomplish things that boost your spirit and nuture your soul. Every parent or caregiver should take the time to read this book."
5,"""The Greatest Gift of All""",My co-worker and I would listen to my cd during our lunch break and when she retired I bought it for her so she could continue listening.
4,THE ONLY DIVA,"When all of my friends were listyening to the Stones,Hendrix,etc.,I was chillin'with Miss Nancy. This anthology,while not perfect contains most of the major Nancy moments including her pop and R&B hits,plus some stunning album cuts. Any future divas out there, this is your Master Class. Listen to ""I'll Get Along Somehow"" and see how it's done."
5,Wow! I didn't know.. Nancy!,"I'm just getting into Ms. Nancy Wilson music over the last couple of months, its been a very good journey. I've been a fan since her columbia days like in the 80's and 90's, like, dont ask my neighbor, do you still dream about me, heavens hands, from a lady with a song cd, and my all time favorite hello like before and if i had my way from the cd if i had my way ...remake of bill withers song, well i got this cd because this is more music from her label she was on then, capitol records, that i dont have and a few i heard on the radio a few times and didnt know it was her... like tell me the truth, and some more songs, its a great cd to lead into her more secular r&b music, which she does beautifully to me... get it and you will see. I have purchased all her cds that are on cd so far. Another cd thats a favorite of mine is But Beautiful made in 1969, very nice cd, listen to samples of that one on here."
5,Awesome!,"Absolutely love the casing. It's perfect to fit right in my drawer. This show is VERY addicting! Many complain about her voice, but she's a duck! Lol. She's supposed to not sound like the other girls. The only problem with it is I have to turn the volume up high to hear the prince talk, but then the music makes me deaf.....o well. I love the show waaaay too much to complain."
5,A True Delight,"This is a beautifully done series. Whoever made this truly loved ballet and fairy tales. While not all of the dancing is animated, the whole things is breathtakingly illustrated, one of the most gorgeous series I've ever seen.I only have one gripe, and that is only about the packaging, where the six discs are stacked within the case so they are more prone to scratches."
1,This toy always breaks,"I bought the Tomy Musical Push 'n Merry Baby Toy for my 5 month old granddaughter. A few pushes and the toy locked and the little dogs could not run around. We took it apart to fix it, and it was impossible to put it back together again. So I bought another toy figuring the first one was just defective. The same thing happened! The gears pop out of positon. The mechanism is too ocomplicated. I would NOT recommend buying this toy."
4,The summer sound of '67,"Of their Atlantic-distributed albums, this is probably Booker T. & The MG's strongest set. Six of the eleven songs are originals, and their cover of ""Groovin'"" by the Young Rascals made the R&B Top Ten. The title track was their first Top 40 pop hit since their smash ""Green Onions"" five years ago, and is up there with the group's funkiest numbers. The smokin' ""Slim Jenkins' Joint,"" named after a soul food cafe two doors down from the Stax studio, was changed to ""Slim Jenkins' Place"" when some DJ's thought it was too sexually suggestive of a title. For instrumental soul music, this is the house band. If you dig Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, or even the Blues Brothers, then treat yourself to this disc."
1,ZZZZZZZ,I found this book exciting for about ten minutes. It relies completely on metaphors and Bell does not have the imagination to pull it off. I found this book formally flat and full of redundancies. This book reminds me of those Saturday Night Live skits that are always being made into movies. The Dead Man may have been fun to hang around with for a few minutes but after a while reading these poems feels like being stuck at a party with somebody who won't shut up.
3,Very spicy and odd tasting,"If you like spice, give these a try. Otherwise, you will need some liquids to swallow them. I guess that's what they mean by ""whoop ass"" peanuts! They are odd tasting, too. I would not purchase them again."
4,Could use some more engineering,It's a great compilation to learn about King Oliver. Some of the tracks are so scratchy that they're not enjoyable to listen to. Perhaps the originals are just too far gone to rehabilitate into anything like clean sound. Other pieces are fine.
3,Pretty good,"The quality is good - considering the age and source of the recordings. It is not good by modern standards, so it takes an effort to get past that. This is jumpin' music, but not something that I want to listen to every day. Probably best for musicians in dixieland bands looking for new ideas. I am not a musician. I enjoy it, but not as much as the recent Wall St. Journal reviewer did. I like the Dixieland Ramblers, the Dukes of Dixieland, Kid Thomas, George Lewis and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band CDs much, much more."
5,The Sit Down Strike - Original Footage,"I remember talking to Victor Reuther about his favorite ""movie"" (yes, that was the word we used) about the origin of the UAW. His preference was a film done by the BBC for the 40th anniversary of the event and his least favorite was the wonderful ""Babies and Banners"" which has been ritually condemned by every one of the old UAW leaders (because of its use of a Ford plant scene while discussing Chevrolet and the not-quite-accurate view of the Women's Emergency Brigade's contribution). This film uses extensive interviews with Victor, the Krauses (long-time editor of Solidarity), and others. The American Experience crew found a great deal of original footage that even the UAW archives did not own including material from the Kelsey Hayes strike. While I never had the privilege of hearing Victor talk about this film, I am sure it was his favorite as it was an accurate and rousing depiction of one of the signal events in his life. I recommend it completely."
3,"Good information, too academic for the average reader","This book was recommended to me by a psychiatrist when I complained about troubles in some of my family relationships. While I find the writing to be too academic (and the author a bit full of himself), if you cut through all of that there is some good and useful information here. Not an easy read but one that is worth it."
2,Show your PhD at the front page......,"I bought this for a Psycology paper I needed to write. I should have gotten my PhD before attempting to navigate this read. I wrote my report, but this book uses terms that are far more advanced than a college student in Psyc 101 has covered. Written in 1964, there are references that I did not understand. My suggestion: Choose another read if you need this for class. (I got a B on my paper)"
1,Games People Play,"I was very upset when this book arrived. I would NEVER order from this particular place again. All other books that I've received from Amazon, regardless of whether old or new have arrived in the condition promised. I work in a used bookstore to benefit Hospice and we would throw out a book that was brought in for resale in the condition of this book. It was advertised as ""good"" and it smelled, had ripped pages, pages falling out because of the broken binding. VERY UNHAPPY!!I will continue to order from Amazon but if I see a book from the company that sent this one ~ NOT!!"
1,Ramble on (endlessly),"I'll make this short (because the book is endless). Long winded, gads of meaningless philosophizing about nothing. An incredibly boring plot. Characters who are out of the 1950s. This is bad science fiction at its best."
3,Read this *AFTER* Startide Rising,"This book is by far the weekest of all of the Uplift books. You may be too disapointed to read his other *BRILLIANT* novels. That is not to say this is a bad book, but its more of a mystery then epic space opera. Read this book after the others for the background information it gives about the whole Uplife universe."
3,Sundiver Proves a Great Book for Young Readers,"In an age of smart phones and the internet, this book doesn't hold up as one of those heavy hidden classics but it is a great book for young new readers. The fascination with lasers is good introductory science for a young adult, as is the exploration of the sun and the characterization of the aliens - often a good way for young people to thoughfully explore differing cultures. I don't think Brin set out here to write a book for young adults but really had I a book like this as an early teen I would have enjoyed it much more. I think a young adult today would be thrilled by this trilogy, as kids today tend to delve more into fantasy than hard science, and this book goes right in between both categories. If your last book was Thomas Pynchon or Neil Stephenson however, you'll find this pretty light reading."
3,Poor Kindle Edition,"I enjoyed the story itself and am looking forward to the other books in the series, though it's hard to overlook the poor quality of the Kindle e-book edition. Nonsense words frequently pop up (""ont"" was used in place of ""out"" a few times in the same paragraph), which has me second-guessing whether some words were referring to some alien sci-fi technology or were just typos. Periods were missing from sentences every few pages, and every word that started with J was capitalized, no matter where it appeared in the sentence. Very strange and very distracting. I'll be sticking with paperbacks for the rest of the series, hopefully those have been properly edited."
4,"Au contraire, read this BEFORE Startide","Don't get me wrong, good old ""Startide Rising"" is the centerpiece of the Uplift novels. If the idea of ""uplift"" makes perfect sense to you right away, then perhaps you should go straight to Startide. However, the Brin universe took a little ""getting aquainted"" time (for me, anyway). Here we have a nice bite-size mystery dealing with humans that make about as much sense of this ""uplift"" thing as the reader. Find out why certain Galactics hate our guts, and why others want to give the poor wolflings a chance in this crazy universe. Unlike later Brin novels (which are drop-dead amazing), this one is a quick sip...you won't need to devote weeks of reading to it (hey I read slow, so sue me) and you'll be ready to plunge right into the next to installments and get the hang of them much better. Bring it along the next time you're on a plane and enjoy this refreshing yarn."
3,"Decent start to Saga, but not great....","I started this ""franchise"" of books with the belief that I was getting into a very deep epic. Well I suppose I am, but this book doesnt really capture it. Here is a rundown / summary of the good and bad:The GOOD:- Pretty solid character development.- Very interesting concepts... uplifting species, visiting the Sun, life on the Sun, etc, etc.- Cool technology that gets explained fairly well and is mostly believable.- Decent writing style and grammar.The BAD:- Somewhat lame ""whodunnit"" plot.- A few dorky, non-well thought out alien races.- Seemed about 50-60 pages too long with some wasted words.- The hype of the series makes this book a little more disappointing than it might have been on its own.Overall, this is a decent read, I gave it 3 stars after all. Read this book just to get the basis for the series and then jump to the rest which get better and better so I'm told. I will be reading Startide Rising next.Recommended, just temper your expectations a bit!"
2,Poor-quality kindle editions,"Important note for buyers: I loved this book, but if you're interested in this book, do not buy the Kindle edition.I bought most of the Uplift series in Kindle editions: Heaven's Reach, Brightness Reef, Infinity's Shore, Sundiver, and Startide Rising. I was extremely disappointed by the quality of these ebooks. Words were frequently mis-spelled or replaced with similar-looking but incorrect words; words and whole passages were arbitrarily italicized; many words were split with hyphens for no reason. It was confusing, distracting, and eventually irritating. I got the strong impression that all these books had been run rapidly through an OCR system and never checked for correctness or quality. For a publishing company of Ballantine's size and reputation this is ridiculous.If Ballantine are going to sell ebooks, they should do it properly, and give them the same care and attention they would to physical books. There's no excuse for releasing shoddy digital products."
2,I gave this book a two for effort,"To be honest this book should be rated a one. The reason why I gave this book a two is because it had alot of well interesting ideas. This book lack focus and direction. I wasn't sure were the heck it was taking me. David Brin brought up so many things I eventually got lost. He also left loop holes and got me thinking about things he never bought up or mentioned again. Most of the time I was left with a big fat ""Huh??"" throught out finishing this book. If you happen to read part two of this series, you will also be loss because it doesn't tie up any loose ends with part one. Well, anyway that is a different story. I wouldn't recommened to book to anyone unless they want to put together the pieces of the story together in thier own way."
3,"interesting conclusion, but far too long getting there","Brin might be onto something with this Uplift idea. The concept itself is intriuging - all species need a patron that guides them into sentience - except man (maybe). I read the summary and had to buy it. Unfortunatly, Brin manages to play down this potentially great storyline, turning it into a weak detective SF novel that is frought with cliche (and grammatical errors - enough to make me shudder.) For all I know, the sequel, Startide Rising, is great. But I won't buy it. Sundiver was enough a waste of my time that it's doubtful I'll ever return to the series. It is a shame, too, because the conclusion is rather compelling. If Brin would only have gotten there about 100 pages sooner, this could have been enjoyable."
3,Worthwhile but mildly disappointing.,"A solid, original and interesting work of science fiction, Sundiver has the important elements of good science fiction: a convincing future, a story filled with wonder, and thoughtful ideas about man's ultimate role in the universe. But frankly, I was a little disappointed. The writing level is low and the characterizations and dialogue are weak. There is a lot of great material to work with and I still haven't given up on the next one, Startide Rising. Worthwhile reading for science fiction fans."
4,Uplift - brilliant idea,This book touches on an idea so unique that the fact that it leaves you with so many questions doesn't matter. Can't wait to finish the series.
1,2 dimensional characters and weak plot,"I had high hopes for Sundiver, but it was fairly predictable and boring. I noticed another reviewer comment about the aliens seeming like second rate Star Trek transplantees, and I agree. I've heard the series gets better after this book, but I may have to wait until I forget how bad this novel was before I pick up the next in the series. Such a shame -- the uplift concept is so interesting, but Brin made the least of it with this book."
2,Incredibly dissapointing SF,"Maybe it was because I had such high expectations of this book from reading the reviews. The beginning WAS kind of interesting, and i thought, hmm. maybe Brin is onto something. Unfortunately, Brin did nothing to take the interesting societal ideas any further---and instead I was left with Miss Marple in Space; filled with a lame mystery, cardboard characters (the 'male lead' was the usual Competent Man found in hard SF, completely uninteresting; even his dysfunctions were neat and tidy) and aliens that appeared to come out of a third rate Star Trek costume shop.others have said that his other books in this series are better, and that might be a fair assumption, but after being very underwhelmed by _Sundiver_, i'm not exactly running to the bookshop."
3,Not so strong,"An expedition composed of humans and aliens travels to the Sun to solve the mystery of the enigmatic beings who live there. The concept of Uplift, in which races achieve sentience via genetic manipulation by more advanced species, is very interesting, but it is pushed too far into the background here. I was also disappointed by the resolution of the mystery, which made the scope of the story much more narrow and trivial than it could have been. There were also some plot elements, such as the main characters schizophrenia and the trauma in his past, that really didn't amount to much. Although I was not so impressed with this book, I went on to read ""Startide Rising,"" which is much superior, so I intend to continue with this series."
3,Read Startide before you read Sundiver,"I thought this was an above average Science fiction novel, but I only gave it 3 stars because I've read all the other Uplift novels, and have something to compare it to. All I can really say is, don't make this your first Brin book, or you might not become as absorbed in his writing as you could. Read Startide Rising first, and then go back in time to Sundiver. The first 3 Uplift books aren't really a trilogy, so the sequence doesn't matter. If you've read Brin's 'Practice Effect'(A non-Uplift story, or is it?) and this book, you can appreciate his 'grand-scheme humor' with the Vanilla Needle. And for those people that reviewed this book and ""heard his others were better"" yes they are. Do yourself a favor and go buy Startide."
3,Politics of a Prison Riot? Mr. Saenz's 15 minutes of fame.,"A book on the politics after the riot, outside of the prison might have been better. More of the same on this subject and not from an expert."
3,Picture is a bit misleading,"Going by the picture, these shoes look like real leather- what I got was some type of fake leather that is really glossy. They seem like they'll hold up OK, but I would not have gotten them had I seen them in person."
4,Nice Shoes,I have been wearing these shoes for a week now and find them to be very comfortable. They look nice enough to wear to the office with a pair of dress pants. I wish they made this shoe in Brown.
5,happy,"I am pleased with this product. Use it. There are no comments. Advise.Happy with my choice. Soft, comfortable walking."
1,false advertizing,"Look at the picture.You can clearly count 8 items and the discription says 8 piece and all you get is 1 container with 8 bungies in it.Every time I've ordered something on Amazon, what the picture showed is what I got. I'm not a happy camper with this at alhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7YPA0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titlel.Hope you make it right."
1,Oh Please!!!!,"I see that some of the the Donald's worker bees are trying to make a quick buck by using their 15 minutes of fame.Most of the women on the show were using their sex appeal to sell many of the items. It got to a point that Donald Trump has to say something on the show. Amy uses this technique very well and writes about it in her book.If you noticed throughout the show, Amy's main goal was getting into Nick's pants the whole time. Way to set your priorites little girl.To her credit, the only idea she had was to use companies from earlier projects to purchase ad space for the later project. Take a real genius to come up with that one.I think Amy is successful....... at pulling the wool over everyone's eyes."
1,Have you seen the show....,Have you seen the show? Men backstab and women use their looks - its as old as business itself. Just look at the cover...
1,What is up with people writing books after being on TV?,"WOW~!!! this book is like a long paper work of taking bits and pieces of great business books that already exsists.you know I can't wait for Omorosa's book to come out, I mean the content is going to be the same but I just want to prove my theory to my friends that what if your on TV for more than 6 weeks you get cocky as hell.If you really want to spend money.. I suggest this book."
2,No substance,"I am not sure how Amy would rate as being an expert in this subject. Just to recap, Amy finished 4th in the Apprentice. She was fired after the interview stage. Four highly experienced managers from the trump organization interviewed Amy on a 1-1 basis. All four came back and stated the same thing.. that Amy has no substance. She uses all the right words and talks `the talk' .. but they all stated that there was nothing behind those words.Most of the book is filled with common sense, everyday items like `Know the power of networking---get connected to the right people'.. really? Wow.. I read that advice in a Dilbert comic. Also ``Dating at work---know the consequences' .. and my personal favorite piece of advice, `No crying in the boardroom' .."
4,Helpful for Younger Women and Those Breaking into the Business World,"As the last woman standing on NBC's hit show ""The Apprentice,"" Amy Henry has a lot to say about business. Rather than focusing on her television experience, however, Henry draws from her eight-year career of managing multi-million dollar software projects and offers a host of strategies for success, particularly in male-dominated industries. She insists on the power of networking with the big boys; stealth bragging, so that people will know about your accomplishments; speaking up and using your charm, beauty and womanly intuition. Henry's advice is similar to those found in other books, but her no-nonsense, woman-to-woman approach will be helpful and enjoyable for younger women and those breaking into the business world."
5,Still out of stock??????????,I love this tie...but I can't seem to find it available anywhere!! When is this tie going to be available?? Does anyone know where to get it? Amazon...C'MON MAN!!
3,Should last longer,"I was satisfied with this pruner, it did everything it was supposed to, but I used it a lot and the return spring broke. It isn't easy to open this thing by hand after each cut and before the next one, so I am no longer satisfied. I paid the 30 bucks for it before the latest price reduction and as far as I'm concerned, it should last longer at that price.I have no idea where to buy parts for this thing or if it's even possible, but if I can get a new spring in there then I will be happy again and it would get five stars."
3,not very good quality product,"i've only had this product a short time and the edges of the mousepad are curled up...i guess ya get what ya pay for, not a big deal, its just a mouse pad. lol."
5,"Great Item, no problems","Nice thin pad, sticks well to table, surface activates my HP optical mouse perfectly, and it's plenty large but easily trimmed down to whatever size you like, with just a scissors."
2,You get what you pay,"I just got this mouse pad shipped today and it kind of let me down. From hearing all the reviews out there about this mouse pad, alot of people claimed that it's ""the best mouse pad out there"".I find that false because at the bottom of the pad, there is no grip somewhat. It's just styrofoam-like.Plus the upper cloth isn't soft at all. It's a bit hard but not as hard as mouse plastic pad.To come to my conclusion, this is indeed a quality of a .74 cent mouse pad. It's not too bad. In order for me to stop making the mouse pad move around when I move my mouse, I lay another mouse pad underneath it with the one that has the better grip, holding this mouse pad in place.Just my 2 cents."
3,Mouse pad,Well the quality of the mouse pad is not great but its ok for the price. If you don't prefer looks this is a good product to buy.
2,Cheap Foam with poorly glued on fabric,It works as a mouse pad (the mouse has smooth traction and the optics will pick up movement over its surface more accurately then it would over most desktops) but it is cheap. The fabric started to peal off of the foam after three months of light use.
4,Very Basic.,"I'm not sure why mouse pads are so expensive in stores, some retailers in my area wanted $5 to $6 for a mouse pad!As usual, I ordered the product from the site with my Prime shipping, hopefully saved a couple bucks. Anyways, the mouse pad is very basic & looks like it will hold up well. I ordered one for use at work & one for home use. They are kind of hard to keep in place, they seem to move around a lot on my desk, but after a couple of days this problem went away. Optical mouses work fine with the mouse pads.Overall, not bad for the price."
5,Changed My Life,"Well, not really. It sticks reasonably well to the surface - could be a little better. It cost less than a buck. Best part is it came in a box big enough for a small microwave with 2 day Amazon Prime free shipping. The box was worth more than the mouse."
1,Fell apart quickly,This thing fell apart pretty fast (after about two weeks of occasional use at the office).I could not recommend it to anyone.
1,1 Week and It Is Already Falling Apart,"Don't buy this -- after one week at my desk, the fabric edges are coming apart so I am here to buy another one!"
1,Too light and moves as mouse is moved,"I find this pad to be useless. It is so light, without a method to hold to a surface, it moves around on the desk and thus it is nearly impossible to move the mouse on the monitor."
1,Cheap Light Wight - Not Good For Opticals,"very light weight. Cheapest quality mouse pad I ever used. As other users have said, not very good for optical mice. Yes the reverse side does work better, but then the pad slides around the desk. Also the sides curl up, it doesn't even lay flat on the desk."
5,Sturdy and not hard,"This is exactly the kind of mouse pad that actually works. It's not shiny; the surface is like a felt. The bottom is non-skid. The shiny mouse pads have too much reflection and the mouse doesn't ""grab."" This product is great."
4,It is Cheap and it Works!,"I bought this about 2 weeks ago, and this mouse pad has not given me any problems. I guess the rubber at the bottom kind of slips, but that happens very rarely. For $2, this was a killer deal!"
2,Just Foam,"This was said to be a rubber mouse pad but the one I got was a light peace of foam, it slides all around and I don't use it. Keep looking if you want a good mouse pad."
1,USELESS!!! (for me anyway),"I put it under my optical mouse, so my cursor wuldn't ""jump"", but this thing has almost NO friction on my desk.I'd rather have to deal with an occasionally ""hyper"" optical mouse than a mousepad that won't stay still."
2,"Cheap Price, Cheap Quality",Don't expect anything more than average because you get what you pay for.
5,One of the best yoga books I've seen,"As a beginning yoga student, I've consulted several books to support my practice and this is one of the best I've found. This book is slightly oversized and printed on thick, glossy paper so it feels really nice to use. The photos, drawings and text are clear and concise and the photos show modifications for different abilities. The book features two asana sequences and chapters on pranayama, relaxation and meditation. The chapter that sets this book apart has sections on problem areas such as hips, hamstrings, abdomen and back. The chapter shows you which poses in the asana sequences help in these areas and then shows additional poses. This is the only book I would recommend to the yoga beginner."
5,Best Yoga book for Jane and Joe,I have been looking for a set of Yoga exercises to do daily. And my search ended in this book. Found this book in the library. Simple and effective Yoga exercises for the Joe and Jane. I primarily do the 40 warm-up asanas and it takes about 20-30 minutes. I have been doing the exercises for last 6+ months. I recommend this book.
4,Just what it says,"I feel this book does what it says, covers the basics. It's easy to read and the pictures clearly show each pose. There is more to read than expected, and it is all beginner-friendly & not over-kill at all. A good book that provides exactly what it says it will."
5,book review,Service was excellent. The book was in even better condition than advertised and was happily received as a Christmas gift.
1,SKYNETUP,"Love the girl and all. She is hot ,but you have to be a real fan to watch this one. I couldn't take it . But barbarella on blue ray ,I'm in heaven....were talking HOT..."
5,"Badfinger - Bad Management, Bad Luck, but oh such GOOD music.","I am listening to Badfinger even as I type this review.This is the Best Of Badfinger Vol 2, and I thought volume 1 was great !! As previous reviewers have said, what an absolute tragedy the story of Badfinger is (Buy the Book ""Without You"" the tragic story of Badfinger).Well I have everything they have released, if you do buy any of the Badfinger best ofs, you will more than likely get hooked and start collecting all of their albums.Some of the best songs on this Cd are off ""Wish You Were Here"" their best album by a mile IMHO.In fact 6 of the 9 songs on WYWH are on this compilation.They were such an original group with every member capable of writing an exhilirating hit song. just have a taste of ""Just A Chance"", ""You're So Fine"", ""Meanwhile back At The Ranch/Should I Smoke"".They were just so good, Damn I miss them!"
4,Hits all the highlights from Badfinger's later period.,"After the release of ""Ass"", Badfinger hit a commercial lull. They signed with Warner Brothers and were not marketed very heavily. They did a few albums, had major legal problems with their manager, and after Pete Ham commited suicide, they broke up until a semi-reunion of Joey Molland and Tom Evans took place in 1979. This collection covers the high points of the later years, and there are some wonderful moments. One unreleased gem is ""Keep Believing"", a song that Pete wrote for Joey after Joey had left the group. Other highlights include selections from the wonerful ""Wish You Were Here"" album. A definite must for any Badfinger fan."
2,working basic examples,the first four chapter was very good in explaininghow and when to use windows servicesThe chapter 5 and onwards was very poor.I am expriencing non workable programs and i am currentlydebugging them. no thanks to the author.Only the first half of the book is OK. The rest is very shabby.
1,VERY BASIC BOOK!,"If you no absolutely nothing about Windows Services, I still wouldn't recommend this book. You can find more useful information from one Google search than this entire book contains. Also, the link to the book's code is incorrect. The code is available via another site but is different than the code in the book. My recomendation...keep shopping!"
4,New twist on a common Mutiny near war story,"While the story is cookie cutter simular to others Navy sub near deaster mutiny story lines, the story has a twist before the LAST MINUTE prevention of nuclear war and the end of the world. Acting was good, and the underlining story line helped hold your interest. Not a five star but held my interest waiting for the BAD GUY to get his just reward. Recognised three top stars from years past and they helped the story. My wife said the captain coming out of the shower had the best abs she ever saw and was quite a looker. Yuck!!!"
1,low quality plastic reel,"The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all."
3,Garden Hose Reel Cart,"I purchased this product because the one I had for over 11 yrs broke. I was looking for something that I did not have to bend down to reel up, I received this product in good condition but found that the product is not as sturdy as it should be. When you are reeling up your hose you have to hold the frame in fear it will break or crack. The inside where the conector is that you attach your hose is constantly leaking. We have tried everything to get it to stop.I feel its not worth the money they are charging, you can get one made better at your local Lowes or home depot for alot less."
2,Crudely Written,"A Persian acquaintance recommended DAVID & LAYLA as did many bulletins I found at Amazon, so I did not expect such a weak story and unbelievable dialogue, especially emanating from the crude David. If you like any kind of farce, this will fill up time, but if you look for great throwaway dialogues that links to plot points, stick to FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, the modern-era successor to SOME LIKE IT HOT.Until the wedding scene, the cinematography in D&L; is barely home movie level. My class did enjoy that scene, but the overall consensus was skip it."
2,Disappointing,"If you're looking for good obscure shoegaze/noise, I'd skip this album. It sounds like a blend of off-key Stereolab and Medicine at their worst (and they're almost always at their best). The female vocalist makes Isabel Sollenberger of Bardo Pond sound like a dead-on-the-note Mozart soprano. Nothing like Ride, Chapterhouse or MBV. Try Bethany Curve, Sianspheric or Th Faith Healers for different perspectives on this type of music that are a lot more enjoyable than this."
2,NOT WORTH 32.00,"THE TIE DOWN STRAPS ARE FOR MY HARLEY,YOU GET 2 5 INCH RUBBER CORDS,AND 4 FLEXIBLE 1 FT CORDS AND 25 PLASTIC 5 INCH HOSE CLAMPS........WHAT DO YOU USE THEM FOR,I CAN GET 1000 OF THEM FOR 5 BUCKS AT BARGAIN CORNER,IM SENDIN MY PACKAGE BACK,NOT WORTH THE MONEY........YOU MIGHT USE THE PLASTIC CASE FOR FISHIN ,THATS ALLR.LAKO PITTSBURGH PA."

4,We'll rock it up and have a ball.,"Before Roy Orbison had his great success with Monument Records, he recorded for Sun Records. His stint with Sun was not so successful. He only released four singles while he was with Sun, only one of which was a moderate success (""Ooby Dooby""). This CD features all the songs from his singles, plus a bunch of songs that were unreleased until after Roy hit it big with another record label. This material is definitely not as sophisticated as his later, more popular material. This is just basic rockabilly, but still quite enjoyable. Fans of ""The Big O"" should like it."
3,Not so great,"Thought it was going to be better than what it was. I only use the box, oil, and dissolver. Rods suck just get a bore snake."
1,Aluminum Rod scrapes and leaves aluminum shavings behind,"I did my first cleaning on my new Ruger 10 22 Rifle on 01-02-2012. I don't want to use the aluminum rods anymore... they are scraping against the barrel and leaving aluminum shavings behind. I'm going for a boresnake instead. Where are the instructions for the plastic adapter components? What is the purpose of these adapters? Also, where is the brush that will allow me to clean the other components? I would not recommend this kit to anyone... pay the extra money and get a good set."
4,A worthwhile little booklet,"This little booklet contains a well done translation of two classic Taoist teachings. Unlike the authors other books (original works and translations of classics), these teachings were made for the barely literate Chinese peasent. The language is very simple - on par with what the booklet ""The Daily Word"" is to Christian teachings. While it's overly simplified teachings may rub some the wrong way, these classic teachings are essential examples of how Taoism was passed on to the common Chinese."
4,Who's Minding the Mint,"""Who's Minding the Mint"" is very funny. It's a real shame it has been overlooked and is only available on tape. I remember seeing it on TV years ago, and tried to find a copy recently, and ended up ordering a used VHS tape. I know it is old but it should still be on DVD like a lot of less deserving movies are. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good comedy. It is about some employees of the mint who print some bills one night after hours to replace some damaged ones.Of course everything goes wrong with their plans and they almost get caught."
1,Bad DVD,There is nothing wrong with my DVD player. I checked it out by playing another DVD. This DVD does not plat at all!
1,who's minding the mint,"pretty bad. Miscast. Hutton as always good.The cast did what it could with the scrip,not much.the movie was pretty bad."
5,Who's Minding the Mint,"We saw this movie a long time ago and have been looking for as we really loved the movie.We're so happy to have it inour collection,"
4,A Good Clean Fun Comedy,"This was one comedy with the moral of the story being that crime does not pay, but love does so. The cast of characters build up the comedy to the point where the ending is a superb anti climax."
4,Old fashioned humor,"Recommended only for those of old fashioned humor - no smut, swearing, etc. just nonsensical fun by actors capable of filling a character without a lot of special effects"
5,I get it!,"Ms. Simpkins has a real talant for storytelling and keeps the reader engaged throughout this journey. If you have a friend going through the struggles of dealing with Alzheimers, this book will give you a window into their new world, the good the bad and the ugly. If you have not experienced, it but know friends that have, you know how helpless you feel watching them in this new world, and you will be able to let them know that you are thinking about them and praying for them and above all -- you ""get it."""

5,Read the Way. It's worth it.,"I find this to be a wonderfully well written book. Some find witchcraft to be evil and that if you have anything to do with it, you will go not get into heaven. What most don't realize is that this is not evil. All this book tells you is interesting facts about Witchcraft roots.Witchcraft is very interesting and it is a religion. This book does not criticize other religions. Witchcraft is based on the old religion of Britian. It also has a mention of herbs and spices that are similar to what the American Indians did long ago to help pain and suffering. If you take a psychology course, this stuff will come up under supernatural.This is real whether anyone wants to believe it or not. I strongly suggest that if anyone has a problem with it, please don't lecture or criticize others who wish to study it. We don't do it to your religion.The Way is an excellent intermediate book!Dyn a wyl y brechewyn yn llygat arall ac ny wyl y trawst yn y lygat e hun"
1,Let the buyer beware,"This book purports to be about an ancient Welsh tradition of Witchcraft. What it actually contains is material clearly drawn from Hebrew mysticism (Kaballah), Gardnerian Wicca, and Greek ritual. The ritual quarter guardian names in this book are the archangels of Hebrew tradition, and the author places them side by side with Irish, Welsh and Roman names.Almost all of the symbols in this book are drawn from published Gardnerian material that has been widely available for decades. So, all in all, there is very little Welsh material here, old or new. You'll want to pass on this one as the claims do not match the material."
5,The Way to your Enlightenment,"This book is causing a great hubub in Welsh Pagan circles only because it has been mentioned by pagans who want to be known as the be all of Welsh Paganism. They don't want a yank to be known as a Welsh Witch, so they have inlisted the help of neo-wales extremists who invent e-mail addresses and keep trashing the author. Not the book mind you. The book is great. The book is true. And how would I know? Because until last week I was loosely associated with this bonkers group. They have become nasty and obsessed and totally bonkers.'The book is Great. The author is honest. The time is right."
5,Great old standard,"I first came across the original version of this title in 1985. I believe it was printed in the early 80s. The advertisement stated that it was a good book to study if I wished to be a Witch and interested in the Celtic tradition. I had just been initiated into the Gardnerian tradition in New York, and since there was almost nothing in our book of shadows, I was very pleased that this book became available at just the right time. Since then, I have read all twenty three of Rhuddlwms books which began to appear in 1976. Unfortunately there are only four of them currently in print. This one (I think) is the best of them all. It is affordable, and contains relavent material for almost any tradition. Excellent Excellent book. You will find out when you read it, that it will touch a cord in you that will take you down a path which you will love and cherish.Gloria WilsonOfferiades Dynion Mwyn traditionNew York"
1,ridiculous,Anyone who lives in Wales can see through the holes in this book. Notice that all the reviews which claim to be written by people in Wales are totally in English. That is because they are written by the author or his friends. This book is about untruth.Buy the book if you want to learn nothing about Wales. Welsh pagans and Welshmen all reject these claims. Cymry glan ydym ni.Check out rhuddlwm@yahoogroups.com
1,copied,Many pagans say that big chunks of this book have simply been copied out of previous work on paganism. That's why I gave up on it - and I didn't like the style
1,sad,i just found this book an insult to the intelligenceand the claims about Wales simply ridiculousthe author would benefit from actually visiting the country occasionally and would then be able to experience the reality not the fantasy
1,what really goes on,"(...)A COUPLE were found guilty of abusing two teenage virgins in Satanic rituals 20 years ago. Ex-Army chef David Stalford and wife Bette, 55, were warned they both face ""lengthy"" jail sentences. The pair, of Hollesley, Suffolk, performed depraved sex acts on the girls during ""quasi-religious"" candle-lit ceremonies. They were remanded in custody for sentencing at Ipswich Crown Court after being convicted of a total of 11 indecency charges."

5,I have met my dynion Mwyn teacher because of this book,"I bought my first copy of The Way back in 1990. Since then I have tried to be patient because it says that when the seeker is ready, the teacher will appear. Well she appeared. I was at the Atlantis Bookstore and who should I meet but the UK representative for Dynion Mwyn. She warned me about some really bad people who were trying to destroy our religion because it was Welsh and they were Welsh extremists. They just don't want anyone to be Welsh and Pagan. I am really sorry for them, but I am dedicating my life to showing everyone what a silly and terrible people they are. It may take years, but I have all the time in the World."
5,Works Great,It is a great way to clear the areas around docks. No more weeds in the jet ski when coming to shore.
3,Just OK,"The bar that the two teeth units mount on is not strong enough.It bent, and had to be removed and straightened, after the second day of use.Not as wide a cut as other units I have seen advertised.Very hard work to get weeds out.The tool does not, for the most part, really cut the weeds.It grabs them and, with enough strength, pulls the weeds out."
1,Product not received,It still has not been received by my recipient Wei-Jen Harrison. The order was originally sent to her business address and then supposedly resent to her home address but she still has yet to receive it.
5,Wonderful children's album,"I love this album and think it is a wonderful for children of all ages. It is fun, and entertaining for everybody. I would recomend this album to anybody and everybody!"
4,Good for compare/contrast with other versions,"Prince Ralph, who lives with his parents King Adolph and Queen Frieda in Upper Crestalia, declares that he wishes to be married. Greedy Queen Frieda, who is consumed with her gem collection, sees yet another opportunity to corner the market on gems in the kingdom. Following the pattern of other versions of this Hans Christian Andersen tale, Queen Frieda devises tests for all of the young princesses in the land, who are, of course, unable to pass the unfairly constructed trials. Enter Princess Opaline, a car fixing, jump-rope jumping princess who must pass the pea-under-the-mattress test to win the hand of the Prince. No surprises here; however, the story does have an updated look and feel, and the winning princess once again proves to be a smart, independent woman."
2,"Bland illustrations, lackluster text","I bought this book in the hopes that the text would be simple enough for my four-year-old. It was simple enough, but at great cost. Details I remember from the tellings I heard as a child were missing. There was nothing in the text that would help a child even remotely empathize with the characters. Ugh. I wanted my son to like or at least remember the story, but hearing this retelling was like eating cardboard. The illustrations weren't that great either, with nothing to attract a child's eye. Get a different version!"
1,disappointed,"I bought this because I loved this book when I grew up, however it was very disappointing. The illustrations are crude and I found the story to be to simple. I wish I had found the version I read when I grew up."
4,"Fun, innovative praise music for older children!","I first heard Dean-o's music at Royal Family Kid's Camp, a camp for abused children. Hearing hundreds of children sing these powerful lyrics is an awesome event to witness. Dean-o's concerts are fun and interactive events, and reliving them through the cd is a great way to get kids plugged in to praise. There isn't much else available which reaches children of all ages and excites them as well. I fully support Dean-o and his music and I think your kids will love him too! Let them try it out--a great alternative to radio or secular music."
1,"bad service, no warranty","Bought this unit along with 2 patio stations and 7 room stations when I was doing the rough wiring building a new house. A year later now house is completed (hey it takes a while to build a new house). I try to use the intercom and one station does not work. I am told by manufacturer and people I bought it from 'Sorry your warranty is up, too bad'. And they expect me to buy a new one, they don't even service them. I would not buy this or any other product from this company."
5,Idler wheel,"Product was good quality and a perfect fit on my 97 LHS. My original equipment idler had 155,000 miles on it and had a pretty good wobble from bearing wear. I reasonably expect that this idler wheel will also last an excess of 100,000 miles."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't waste your time or money on this bag, the description states that the bag is made of heavy leather...it's not. The bag is constructed of lightweight leather and cheezy, I plan to return it today."
2,NOT Happy with it,"The bag is not hard as its written, and the leather material SUX and not like the description.Its not that bad but I thought the leather will look better than this"
3,3 or 4 good tracks,"I've been a Kinks fan since 1964, and I bought all of their 70s albums even as most of their following deserted them. Looking back, a lot of their work after ""Everybody's in Show Biz"" really went downhill. For the most part, the concepts of ""Preservation,"" ""Soap Opera"" and ""Schoolboys in Disgrace"" just didn't work. Sorry Ray. But on EVERY album they released, there are some gems that hold up. Buy this C.D. for the three EXCELLENT Ray Davies ballads: ""9 to 5"" (NO, not the silly Dolly Parton song, it doesn't come close to this), ""You make it all worthwhile,"" and ""A face in the crowd"". Plus, there is one decent rocker "" You can't stop the music,"" even though there are parts of it derivative of other Kinks tracks. As far as the rest of the C.D., it' a throwaway. Parts of it are even embarrisingly bad. But I'd still buy this soon-to-be out-of-print C.D. for the above mentioned Ray Davies CLASSICS."
3,Can't Explain,"On the plus side there are many good songs such as ""Ducks on the Wall,"" ""Underneath the Neon Sign,"" ""Holiday Romance,"" ""Face in the Crowd,"" ""You Can't stop the music,"" ""Rush Hour Blues,"" ""You Make it all Worth while,"" and ""You Can't Stop the Music."" On the down side you just want to throw up when you hear the ""Can't Explain"" riff open the album. Enough! Also you Can't Stop the Music does seem a bit patterned after the Rolling Stones ""Last Time."" Then again so was elvis costello's ""You Belong to Me"" and nobody bitched about it."
2,One of the weaker Kinks albums,"This album is a transition album for me. It's not quite as bad as the Preservation Act CD's, but it's not as good as Schoolboys in Disgrace. But at least it shows the 70's Kinks finding their direction."
5,Unique and really cool,It's excellent! Great for a change of pace - I listen to music all day long in my office and this is always refreshing to add to the mix. I don't think Ray Davies is capable of creating anything other than greatness!
3,Pretty good,"The gloves were certainly very fine leather, the actual size was a bit smaller than I was expecting (using the online sizing guide)and the fingers aren't all that long so I would err on the side of caution and order perhaps one or a half-size larger than the measurements indicate. They have a label saying that they are made in Italy. The stitching had a few loose ends sticking out through the knuckle-holes."
4,I agree,"I had pretty much the same experience as the other review, the gloves are sized smaller than listed. The gloves arrived promptly, the leather looks like pretty good quality and I really like the color. I recieved one pair and sent it back for a half size larger, I appreciate that the company includes the form to send it back if necessary with the original shipment and doesn't require authorization to exchange/return. Unfortunately, not having much experience with gloves, I did not realize that another half a size might not be enough and I may need to repeat the process. I'm excited to use them when they fit right, though!"
5,Great book and easy to learn.,"If you want a relaible startup to understanding Photoshop Elements, this is a wonderful resource."
5,great book,Pleasant read and very useful. It has helped me a lot.I highly recommend it for anyone that has had health problems.
5,"Nice collection, well photographed","Debbie Bliss has produced a very nice book on knitting for the entire family. Her designs for children are still more stunning than those for adults, but there are several nice men's and women's sweaters here. Instructions are simple. Worth owning."
2,Not a good book for anyone under 30,"The book cover is nice, the pictures are nice, but the desgins are very disappointing.Even though most of the designs can be knitted for the whole family.. they don't appeal to a young adult like me.The sizes for adults are all large and baggy. They don't fit well at all! They are just supersized version of toddler sweater.I think Debbie bliss should just stick to designing children's wear. Please don't add more rows and stitches to children wear's pattern and call it adult wear."
4,Snob to Snob,"A quick and enjoyable read with plenty of name-dropping (a pre-rrquisite for snob to snob debate). Discussion of contents with other snobs will hopefully incite riot. Volume 2 should correct page xi in the author's introduction and it's reference to David Crosby and ""Teach Your Children"". While it is true that Crosby is more hip, the aforementioned song is the product of his bandmate Graham Nash. Ah, snobs will be snobs!"
4,Fun but inessential!,Ok this is a very funny concept and makes for great reading on a trip. HOwever it is somewhat short. Some stuff is really true about rock snobbery but to some degree it falls short of its ambitions. Still it is worth a read.
4,Absolutely Beautiful Spiritual Fountain,"I love this St. Francis fountain, as he has always been my favorite Saint. I love animals and so does St. Francis. What a beautiful person he was. The fountain works just fine. I have to change the water every few days and rinse off the pump. The frogs and/or toads just love it too! I've had it over a year now and some of the coating of paint has come off. That's the only problem I have had with this item."
4,Help for the Mushroom Hunger,"It's almost that time of year...Mushroom Season: A tradition that is truly unique to the Midwest. Mushroom hunters scour the countryside for a very short season to uncover the delicacy of morel mushrooms. Peter Jordan, longtime mushroom hunter, has written a useful new book, The Illustrated Encyclopedia Mushroom Identifier, which will help the amateur mushroom hunter tell the difference between poisonous and edible fungus. Previously published as ""A New Guide to Mushrooms,"" and as part of a larger compendium, ""The Ultimate Mushroom Book,"" it includes bibliographical references and an excellent index."
1,OMG... this movie was awfull!!!!!!!!,"OMG.... talk about an movie that some getto brothas jacked an white persons family owned 8mm camera that these getto guys used to make an movie with. This movie is JUNK. 1st off this was prolly done not with an 8mm ,, but an old panasonic VHS (non hi-fi) camcorder. You can hear the wind when they talk and the picture ...(is horrible). My son that is 4yrs old can hold a camcorder better then these YO-YO heads that made this movie.. its a shame that this was even released on DvD. I highly would not recommend renting this...... not even if it came on FREE on TV,,, I would call the TV station to warn them to turn off,,, because it is really bad and no1 would watch it. BAD MOVIE rateing -100,000"
3,The Band Left the Lost Riots Behind,"When Hope of the States came out with their debut album, ""The Lost Riots,"" I was the one singing its praises. I waited for ""Left"" by Hope of the States to go down far enough to where I could get it for $15 (shipping included).Expectations were very high... and I don't think I have listened to a bigger disappointment. I think the band has taken a few steps back by creating an album that sounds like Interpol. I was wanting an improvement on ""The Lost Riots."" I'm okay with something in a completely different direction. It just so happens that direction has already been done by an array of bands with the first one coming to mind being Interpol.This isn't a bad album. It just isn't a very good album. Perhaps I can revisit this album in a couple of months. Sometimes all it takes is a couple more listens to enjoy an album or to see something in it you didn't see before. ""Left"" may have that potential, but for now it is a disappointment."
1,buy something else....,"I bought this 1 week ago at a local Staples.. The box makes it sound like the solution to all your problems.. It also says they offer tech support 24 X 365..Sounds great.... the problem is..it will not install on my computer. I keep getting a message to remove NORTON ANITVIRUS before I can install Panda. I removed NORTON and it no longer can be found thru control panel, remove software or thru a search of my hard drive.PANDA still will not install. I keep getting the same message. UNINSTALL NORTON.So I tried to contact tech support per the box. I found out they offer tech support 24 x 365 via email. I have sent 3 emails in a week and have received no response.Bottom line is I have a product I cannot use.. TECH SUPPORT does not exist. It deserves 0 stars in my book. Spend your money somewhere else."
5,OH MY GOD,"i had a copy of this tape when i was in high school (about 8 years ago). my friends and i still quote it to this day. of course it helps that we're in a band, but man, i'm telling you...this is the funniest damn thing i've ever heard in my life. it rivals the holy grail for its quotability. anyone who likes brit humor, has ever been in a band (esp. a heavy metal band), or who used to watch the young ones has got to hear this. BC what up dog!"
3,"Cute concept, falls short",I really loved the idea of this toy. A little windchime that was cute to look at...but I found that it was really hard to find a place to hang this that made it usable for my baby. It seems to be too big to hang in the usual places you might hang baby toys. I really ended up not using this toy very much at all. I'd look elsewhere if I had a do-over.
4,Good considering the price.,"This TV is a good value for the price.The user guide leaves a lot to be desired.The sound volume is adequate, but could be a bit louder.Be careful when adjusting the antenna. It broke ( snapped off) when I tried to adjust it, and I replaced it myself with one from a parts store.I have mine in the kitchen attached to cable, and overall it has a satisfactory picture.The packaging for this TV is excellent.I rate this TV as good considering it's low price."
1,Junk,Looked like a piece of junk. Poor quality. Poor manual. Didn't work at all. Sent it back. Stay away from this one!.....
1,Don't waste your money......,"This little TV is ""cute"" but has very poor reception and picture quality. Spend a little more for a quality product!"
3,works great if you use dvd or cable amp,"This TV has great features and works great with a DVD player, but with air or cable you need a cable signal amplifier, with that it works great.. but you have many cables and wires around the thing."
3,ok for the price - bad speakers,"We got one of these to replace an old 5"" Sony TV (tube) that we have in the kitchen. The antenna on this unit wasn't able to pick up much (but the Sony didn't pick up many channels either -- we live in the hills). The sound out of the built in speakers was really awful (very tinny sounding which after a while was very annoying). I connected the unit up to a Tivo (which is connected to cable) and ran an external Koss speaker to it so now everything is perfect. The picture is good. For the price it was ok, but if you have to rely on the built in speaker, it's probably not acceptable."
1,unhappy,"I am very disatisfied with the product as we cannot get it to work properly, we also requested a return authorization on January 30 and on february 6th and got no response, therefore the item is sitting in a box reminding us what a waste of our money it was."
5,school,I bought this for school. it was useful then. been teaching 6 years and haven't touched it once since school.
4,"""Firestarter""--Japanese style","Maybe more like 3.5 stars. Junko Aoki is a lonely young woman who uses her pyrokinetic abilities to avenge the victims of violent crime. A chance encounter with a gang of teenage psychopaths leads her on a personal crusade that brings her to the attention of the police and a secret vigilante organization called the Guardians.Despite the cliched premise, this novel maintains interest, even though it felt a bit too long. Author Miyuki Miyabe presents interesting characters and some effective surprises. Her sure style of pacing and plotting derails a bit at the finale, which depends on a rather large coincidence. The translation was also a bit awkward at times, but I intend to read more from this author."
1,Receive Battery twice and returned it twice,"I bought it, installed it, charged it and did not worked.Received a new one, installed it, charged it and it dis not worked !!!Got a refund, reseller said it is a design problem.Do not buy this brand!!!"

4,It is an exhilirating movie which tests friendship .,"This movie was a movie worth watching. Jim Carey does an excellent job acting dumb. The way the movie was put together made it funny. How each of the events fitted together snugly. It was an exciting movie which made me fall of my chair from laughter. It made my stomach hurt and my eyes cry. It was a fun packed movie about two friends that try to make it to Aspen to give a beautiful millionaire her briefcase back. Question is, will they survive? Watch this if you are in a gloomy mood."
1,i cannot believe this crap!,"i cannot believe they are disgracing this classic movie by doing the ol' ""unrated"" shpeel on it. this is blasphemy on new line cinema's part because a classic comedy should never be seen in another light than the original release; in my opinion. i fell in love with this movie and now they got the unrated edition; if the ""extended"" scenes are so funny, why did they leave them out in the first place? it is still as funny as it was the first time i saw it and this is a completely ridiculous move by new line. i can understand if they did this to the ludicrous sequel ""dumb and dumberer"", but this is just out of hand."
4,It had its funny parts,"Yeah, It had its funny parts but overall it was pretty stupid, to the point where It just became annoying. Yeah, Jim Carey is just Awsome!!!!!His movies are just the best but this one...it was funny but...just not as funny as his other movies.It was more disgusting than funny.I just didn't like it.Besides the point that there was absolutely no plot to it.so,yeah...thanks Jim for giving it its funny parts, though Ace Ventura and the Mask were better.Better luck next time."
3,Dumb fun and toilet humor,"This is another movie from when I was a teen. Back then, I loved it! Now, I still chuckle at the juvenile humor. Yes, it's stupid, but that's how it was intended."
4,very funny,i could watch this movie over and over again *just* for the scene where Mary gets attacked with the snowball - classic!
3,Not as good as the first time,"An absolute classic, but the original is better. This is one movie where the un-cut version takes away from the hilarity. Picture is nicely touched up though. Still one the the best films of its genre"
4,A SOLID AND HILLARIOUS MOVIE,"TWO FOOLISH FRIENDS [JIM CARREY AND JEFF DANIELS] TAKE A TRIP TO ASPEN AFTER A RICH GIRL [LAUREN HOLLY] LEAVES HER SUITCASE AT THE AIRPORT. ONE OF JIM CARREY'S BEST MOVIES. JIM CARREY AND JEFF DANIELS WERE A VERY FUNNY TEAM AND THEY WERE THE MAIN REASONS THIS MOVIE SUCCEEDED. THERE'S PLENTY OF HILLARIOUS SCENES IN THIS MOVIE AND IT'S A GREAT MOVIE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE BUDDY MOVIES. ANOTHER GEM FROM JIM CARREY. FOLLOWED BY A SHORT-LIVED ANIMATED SERIES AND ALMOST A DECADE LATER BY DUMB AND DUMBERER, WITHOUT JIM CARREY AND JEFF DANIELS."
1,Unrated = Worst Mistake Ever,"Why in the world would the producers soil such a genius comedic gem with these worthless, unfunny and disgusting ""bonus scenes?"" I got this for Christmas last year along with my fancy new Blu-ray player, yet was so utterly disappointed that there wasn't even a ""theatrical version"" available to play, instead having to suffer through the trash they stuck in for no apparent reason.""Colin's"" one-star review sums it up very well. Read it and see why you should stay far, far away from the unrated Blu-ray version of Dumb & Dumber."
5,classic and hysterical,this movie is a classic Jim Carrey comedy. I've seen it about 105 times and still crack up while watching it. Mary Swanson.. sweeney... samsonite! Its samsonite!
1,Scenes Are Cut For a Reason,"I love this movie, the PG-13 DVD version that is. This ""Unrated"" Blu-Ray is extremely disappointing. Instead of loading the Blu-Ray with a ton of nonsense, why not give me the option to watch the PG-13 version. Even the DVD version gives the standard and widescreen versions. The uncut scenes that are in this unrated version are not funny and ruin the movie. I'll never watch this Blu-Ray again and it was a waste of money. Stick to the PG-13 DVD."
5,oNE vERY fUNNY mOVIE!,"This is one of the funniest, crudest and best comedies I've ever seen. So many funny scenes and never a dull moment and yet I wonder if there could be a sequel. Full of toilet humour, if it sounds your thing then see it, you'd be dumb not to."
5,Dumb and Dumber,"This movie may be full of potty humor, but I think that it is safe to say that this is the funniest movie I have ever seen. I'm even watching it right now. If you like Carrey and Daniels, you will definitely like this movie. I still can't get over the Mocking Bird Song. You'll see."
5,Stupidly Haliorios even if you hate comedy you'll laugh,"I think that this movie was very well acted and put together, there are pranks, accidents, and exteremly DUMB choices that Loyd and Harry make:) I definetly think that if you don't have this movie you need to get it!"
5,Non-stop laughs,You can't find humor like this in any other movie. It is hilarious throughout the whole film. The childlike behavior of Lloyd and Harry is great.
2,You have got to be kidding,"Don't you folks know this movie never would have been released if it weren't for ""MASK"". This movie was so bad, they could not let it be seen until Carrey became a well known and liked comedian. It [stunk]."
1,Snooze,I know so many people who love this movie that I decided to give it a try. I found it so boring that I actually fell asleep during it.
1,Grossly Discusting!,It didn't make me laugh; It made me sick to my stomach. I can't understand how this movie rates all those stars.
1,Romney-Ryan Campaign Commercial?,"Is this a Romney-Ryan Campaign Commercial?? From the title, I am thinking it is. I'm certain of it. You see, it's the title. It captures them perfectly."
1,Hmmmm,"i awaited very much of this movie, but it was not so funny, it had 3 or 4 laughters and that also weren't jokes i fall of my chair! but tastes are diffrent and you can see, either u like it or u don't!"
1,Repulsive,It is a ... movie without a doubt. Whats disturbing about it is that Jeff Daniels went from Arachnopobia to garbage like this and for Jim Carrey garbage like this is nothing new for that guy. It is full of ... pranks and foolish behavior that you find in really stupit people. It has everything immature that could be from farting to burping out loud all of the ... behavior that you could ever find is in this movie. Another sad factor is the attention that this rediculous film recieved its always the dumbest movies that get raved about. But yet again TBS and TNT were given the movie right away the three major networks did not even have it on so that right away tells you that ... movies do not work.
3,Better or worse?,"As soon as my friend brought this, one of the best movies ever made, over to my house with an ""unrated"" stamp on the front, I was quite wary. When I looked at the case and saw ""6 extra minutes"" I knew they had ruined a classic. After watching it, to my dismay I was right. If you're looking to buy this movie, that is of course if for some reason you don't already have the original, don't even think about it. The added content is completely unnecessary, and quite annoying."
4,Ha!,"If you're looking for highbrow comedy, you most certainly will not find it here! There's lots of slapstick comedy and gag humor, but if you're into that kind of thing, then this is gold. Heck, the title says it all."
5,Jim Carey at his best in this comedy classic,I remember the tender age of 13 when I first saw Dumb &Dumber. Thriteen years later the film is still funny as it was back in the day.This movie displays Mr. Carey's talent as a comedian and it's a film you can't help but laugh.
5,Quality,"Those who don't like like this movie should go get a sense of humor, even my mom found this funny, and she's old!! The Farley Brothers create one of the top comedy films of this century. It will without a doubt go down in history as a classic, because it is."
4,eh,cthis movie is freaken funny but theres no dam special features! all they have is the trailer. if they dont make a ten years special dvd next year ill.........illl......ill.......be very angry
5,Possibly one of the best comedies of all time,"I don't understand why this special edition took so long. Possibly one of Jim Carrey's best movies. I thought a special edition would come out during the release of the horrid sequel ""Dumb and Dumberer"", but i can see why they wouldn't want to associate with the sequel because it doesn't compare. 2004 made sense because Dumb and Dumber would creeping up on it 10th anniversary. But I really can't complain Iv been waiting for a proper release of this classic comedy for quite some time. Peter and Bob Farrely unfortunately need make more speical editions out of their films, im still waiting for Outside Providence, but i have a feeling thats going to be a while. Anyway i wouldn't miss out on this re-release deff. worth the upgrade!!!"
2,Mostly Dumb.,"OK there are actually some LOL bits in this movie, it is just that there are to many groans also. Good enough for 2 stars, but there is not enough here to say that it is a good movie, worthy of 3 stars."
5,Freakin' Hilarious!,"Wow, what a great comedic performance by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Both share equal hilarity in this movie! Prepare to laugh - one of greatest 20th century comedies!"
5,Absolute class,This is my absolute favourite comedy of all time. This is Jim Carreys masterpiece. It is an old film and I own it but never tire of watching. On a dull rainy day this film is a real pick up. The hilarious scenes never fail to amuse me. The fact that Jim and Jeff play two absolutely hapless idiots is what makes this film so great and you cannot help but love their characters.
4,Slapstick at It's Wierdest,"A typically Jim Carrey film. I do beleive the title to be a rather large understatement. Carrey and Daniels average IQ must be a combined 1/2 point.Carrey and Daniels are living together in a rundown apartment with only a worm farm and a parrot. Carrey is a limo driver for rich executives making ends meat. Until one day, he thinks he has met the girl of his dreams. Carrey unaware that she left her bag at the airport on purpose for a ransom exchange scoops the bag up and presedes to drag Daniels across the country searching for her so he can return it. On the way they manage to kill a man with rat poisioning, set themselves on fire, trick a cop into drinking urine, and even manage to stay alive. Once there they discover that the suitcase was full of money and deceide to start living the rich life until the ransomers finally catch up..."
1,"Dumb, dumber....dumbest!","This movie seems to enclose every kind of juvenile and childish humor that can be found. Alot of pranks including burping and farting. Some might find it funny for a while, but after about 10 minutes it gets old. I am not big fan of Jim Carrey, but this was a new low for him, and as for Daniels one have to wonder what make him participate in a movie like this. Daniels is actualy a talented actor. The story is thin and it is certainly not here that you will find a reason to watch the movie(and nowhere else in fact). But I will say if you like Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2 and movies like that you will propably enjoy this movie too."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IF YOU EVER CONSIDER SEEING THIS MOVIE, TAKE MY ADVICE AND DON'T. THIS MOVIE REALLY SUCKED."
1,Painfully Stupid,"How far does the Q-tip have to go until this gets funny? Its unwatchably stupid. I really cannot put my finger on why I dislike this movie so much, I just do. It could be Jim Carrey's stupid faces he makes throughout the movie. Like that whole fish face thing in his dream sequence before he gets punched out. Stupid beyond all recognition. Its ashame, too, because I do like Jim Carrey. Its one of those movies where I imagine myself sucker-punching the main characters. I feel like I am out of the loop because everyone I know loves this movie."
1,Pathetic Movie,Pathetic Movie. I had great expectation but it just turned out to be one the worst movie I have evenr seen
1,Jim Carrey Finatic not likeing Jim Carrey,I love almost every Jim Carrey Movie out there. This and the sequal is the only exception. The ending killed the entire movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I get the idea but there is not a man alive that would be that dumb. It is a sin to watch this movie if you are male in my own opinion.
3,Dumb-founded,"Two dumb guys track a beautiful girl cross-country to return a suitcase she left to pay off her husband's kidnappers. Hijinks ensue!Jim Carrey and Jeff Bridges play a duo of doofusses in an occasionally hilarious screwball comedy. Truth be told, it's hard to believe that two guys who can manage to drive cross-country can be all THAT stupid, even if their van is pimped up like a poodle (a sheepdog, actually, but that didn't alliterate as well). Most of the verbal humor didn't connect. But several scenes of physical humor got me laughing out loud, especially the ones that involved a flying champagne cork, a frozen ski lift and a pedicure via power sander. I only wish that the entire movie could have achieved that high level of hilarity."
5,Best movie ever,Dumb And Dumber is definitely a great movie. It is one of those that never gets old like the Austin Powers movies. I have had that movie for over 2 years and I still laugh every time I watch it.
5,funniest movie i've ever seen,I purchased the movie dumb and dumber back in 96 and i still crack up now 1999 every time i watch it. Great comedy movie with Jim Carrey.
4,A HILARIOUS MOVIE (did I spell that right?),"The best comedy I have ever seen besides 'Clerks'. It's Jim Carrey's best, sure beats a few of his movies. Stupid is cool in this movie. And they are one big bunch of idiots (in a funny sense)."
2,Get the original version-NOT the unrated one!,"The blu-ray's picture quality is fine, my complaint is the extra scenes which really hurt the movie with their graphicness. Not one of the extra scenes or alternate scenes is an improvement to the movie-quite the opposite in fact. They couldn't have given us both versions on a blu-ray?!The original movie is a classic and masterpiece-stay with it. Unfortunately, it's not available on blu-ray, just dvd."
3,Disappointment to anyone who loves the original.,While the transfer is fine. The fact that this is a redone unrated version and does not include the original totally kills it for me. Ruining great scenes like the diner. Hopefully there will be a rerelease with the original cut.
3,The original is better.,"An absolute classic, but the original is better. This is one movie where the un-cut version takes away from the hilarity. Picture is nicely touched up though."
2,worst movie ever (you call this comedy!?!),"This movie [stinks]!! Who thinks that people with severe diarrea are funny?? Unlike some people, I don't like movies like that! People who rate this movie 5 stars don't know what real comeady is!!"
1,Disappointing,"""If only a 0 star rating were possible, this movie along with There's Something about Mary would be the recipients. I enjoy slapstick, but this movie is just insidiously stupid.""Those were the comments I made nearly 3 years ago. I have come around on There's Something about Mary, but I don't think I would with this one."
1,Repellent,"Possibly the most irredeemably awful, repellent, unfunny, dreadful waste of videotape ever. I was disgusted and appalled by this film."
1,What were writers drinking when they wrote this?,"This so called ""funny"" movie is no more than a load of bull. It has both Carrey and Daniels at their worst. The humor is far fetched. It has no real plot and it is all together stupid. I apologize if I disagree with just about all the other reviews but this movie is so terrible I can't lie about it."
5,Speedy and Up To Par,Dumb and Dumber arrived within four days. It is in prime condition and exactly as specified. Excellent!
4,Excellent for a debut direction,"As i said, for a debut direction, this is very funny, no doubt the story id very good, and i have no problem with the acting. Again, as the farrwlly brother's other comedies, this is pure toilet bad taste humour, which in some cases isn't bad. If you liked there's something about mary, and me myself and irene, you should consider this."
4,"Funny movie, great HD transfer","Who can deny the fact that this Jim Carrey classic is hilarious, especially when a liquid laxative ruins a date :) The HD transfer is pleasing to the eyes and worth an upgrade."
2,Extra footage - original better,Contains extra footage and which of course are funny but the original theatrical release is much better version of the movie.
5,One of the best,"My sister and I have nearly memorized all the lines in this movie. We love it! Some comedies have alot of funnies, but not much of a plot. This one's hilarious in a goofy, idiot sort of way have and the plot isn't too bad either - it's very easy to follow. Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels are great together - the casting couldn't have been more perfect."
3,The rated version was better!,"They took out some scenes in this movie for a reason. They should've left it that way. Some of the scenes dragged on, which took away from the enjoyment of the first one. And there were some scnenes that were just not necessary. Once my fiance and I (who are not squeamish or prudish by any means) saw the bathroon scene with CJ (I think? the trucker as the diner)and saw him grab his hairy crotch, we stopped the movie. Just didn't need to see that."
2,Makes the movie look vulgar and not as funny as the original theater version,Got this vid thinking that i would get more funny moments that i loved from the first movie but what i got is mostly vulgarity or disgusting stuff ( spit in burger thingy) and stuff that somehow does not seem to fit in the movie or looks out of whack....Call me picky but i think the original edit is or was just right.Those parts were left out and i think they were for a reason. Usually i am a big fans of extra stuff in a movie but sadly not this time.Loyd And Harry looked more like morons now than just being dumb dudes...Had i known i would have not bought this...
3,"Good info, but doomsday delivery","We (2 parents, a 9-year-old, a 12-year-old) viewed this as a supplement to our earth sciences studies after reading about volcanoes. Good info, including some really interesting experiments and demonstrations, but half the narration was something along the lines of ""Would the volcano destroy the entire region within days? Would xyz thing that could possibly happen reverberate through history?"" Reasonable possibilities, yes, but this would have been much better to watch without the hyped-up drama."
5,You like pie or you don't.,"Here's the deal"": either you know and love Roky Erickson and Captian Beefheart or you don't. Contemporaries of this band might be Sun City Girls and Three Day Stubble.If you don't want to like this band please don't try. It doesn't make sense and it never will and that's why it rules the earth in so many ways. There are a few different methods of catching this, jazz people - have you ever heard Ak Sak Ma Boul? Sun Ra? It's not really too out of the meter if you consider who came before. I was very fortunate to have seen some of the TFUL282 shows in SF CA in the nineties. They could play the balls off a yak. I give 5 stars because their music helped me win through some very tough times, and I am a better person for having participated in the fray. Thank you and goodnight."
4,Good Album,"This is a deeply strange album. It is deliberately discordant and sour much of the time, but that is what makes it special. The songs may sound noisy but they are structured and well thought out.If you are new to Thinking Fellers Union, I would recommend getting Strangers from the Universe, not this album. If, however, you like the band and are ready to listen to some of their more challenging music, you will find plenty to think about here."
4,Not for kids,"This is a fun little series. Does have much fan service so if that freaks you out look elsewhere.While not at the top of my list of harem anime it was worth buying IMO. I enjoyed the series and laughed often through it. The animation was good, English dubbed voices were fairly well done and for the most part the usual harem anime story lines were done well."
5,Kanookon,This anime is fun to watch. I only wish the kid was bite taller and his voise was bite lower. I like watching him going though the story.
3,Good but had no direction.,The girl who cried fox. funny but there was one episode where a enemy came out of nowhere attacks everybody says they will be back for Big brother! but never comes back. and your like WHAT WAS THAT? it has a LOT of ecchi humor I wish the show had more direction than this girl loves him and he's to embarrassed to say he loves her and there's another girl who loves the male lead Obviously there always fighting over him personally I thought it was good it did have it flaws I would give it (3 a and a half stars) I hope you enjoy it.
3,OK anime--poor product packaging,"As for the anime, it was just OK. A story is buried in there somewhere... The first episode was very good, but the following over-the-top sexuality obscured the plot. As for the packaging--like so many other Anime Works I have purchased, this set included a loose disc that was covered in scratches. As it played without issue, I did not seek a replacement."
5,Fascinating,This collection of testimonies from former Jehovah's Witnesses gives us a real insight into their lives. What initially attracts them to this cult? What is it that ultimately leads to their leaving (bearing in mind the harsh consequences of this action).Inspiring.
5,So cute,These are exactly what I expected. Cute polar bear for the holidays. Makes great decoration and gift. Price is right so also good for party favors. Would definitely buy from this company again. Product arrived quickly.
5,Different but just as good,"Now in the 3rd generation the Dieux Du Stade calendar and inturn the DVD went with a studio based style. I like the approach and it was much better than last year's situations. Also I like that the DVD has gone back to black and white - much sexier than last year when it was in colour.A little dissappointed that some of the guys for the first two DVDs didn't make a third showing but Julien Arias and the NZ guy did make up for it. As I tell my friends, I will be rooting (!) for the French Team in the next Rugby World Cup. Who knew rugby could be so sexy !!!If you like the first two DVDs you will enjoy this one - I know that I did."
4,One Night Stand - Mis-Teeq,"UK Maxi Single Track Listing for -""ONE NIGHT STAND"" - MIS-TEEQ1) One Night Stand (Stargate Radio Edit)2) One Night Stand (Sunship Radio Edit)3) Lickin' On Both Sides Album Megamix2001"
3,"Great book, terrible print quality","This book is a fantastic introduction to Hegel. Michael Fox succeeds in making this important but often misunderstood (or not understood at all) thinker truly accessible, as the title of his book claims. I checked the hardcover out at my library and was so impressed that I ordered my own copy from Amazon. For some reason, though, the print quality in the paperback edition is terrible. It's readable, but it looks like it was run through a 30 year-old Xerox machine that was low on ink. Maybe others didn't have this problem, or maybe I got scammed or something, but it's really irritating to spend so much money on a new book that looks this bad on the inside."
5,"Appreciate Hegel's brilliance with a lucid, compelling treatment.","Hegel is infamously difficult to read and understand. This book is a succinct and clear guide to interpreting Hegel. It is well written, and although succinct, it does not oversimplify. I read this book alongside Hegel's The Phenomenology of Spirit, and this book greatly improved my understanding and appreciation of Hegel's line of thought. Without this book I may or may not have plodded on to finish reading Hegel, but I certainly would have gotten much less out of the Phenomenology. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in unlocking Hegel. It is succinct and well written without oversimplification."
3,Pretty good,"I've been a devout fan of eiht and CMW for years and I have to say that I was slightly disappointed by this album.Eiht seems to have dropped his priceless style and switched to the cliché rap of many untalented artists.The beats are nearly all the same and we hear none of those amazing piano beats and R&B choruses Eiht used to have, as in We Come Strapped, Death Threatz,Last man standing,Section 8,N my neighborhood and Represent(CMW).It's worth buyin nonetheless.Fine tracks include HustleMan,Gangsta,2freakE and Drama.Despite the weaknesses in this album, i do recommend it."
5,The Best,"I can say that they are beautiful and besides that really resistant, because i have one child and sometimes he sits on it...so that way i know they are really strong tables....must have it...."
5,Absolutely Great set !!!,Absolutely Wonderful 2 CD's and DVD set! Great piece of memory! Beautiful surround sound! Must have ! Highly Recommend !!!!
2,Not useful as a learning guide,"I picked this book up hoping it would clarify some of the documentation that's freely available from Apache, but in most cases it was not helpful. It simply is not well-written and does not flow well, especially as a 'Teach Yourself' book. Disappointing..."
2,Not a good book for beginners,"This book covers a wide scope of Apache configurations and operation mechanisms, though so few practical examples present. If you want to gain deep insight into Apache 2, go to another book."
5,Simply the best,"This is probably the best novel I have ever read (out of several thousand) - not just the best SF novel or best young adult novel, but simply the best. It weaves philisophical points about the nature of truth and scientific method into a thrilling adventure of defiance to a represive regeme, with many surprise plot twists. I have a copy that I have saved for over 4 years and will save for another 6 to be able to give it to my niece at the appropriate age."
4,Good starter set,"If you are looking for a good starter set for Go, one that is decently priced and of okay quality, then this works well. Its not perfect though.ProsInexpensiveLarge boardRather PortableConsMy board is brand new and shows some warping in the cardboardPieces are tinyIf you are looking for a starter set, this is pretty good. I really like it. I wish the tokens were larger, but that not a deal breaker."
5,Super Read,"Even if you haven't read the earlier titles in the series, Debbie gives enough background so you will not only enjoy reading and learing about Alaska, but want to read the previous titles."
1,Buy the original albums,"I listened to Vanilla Fudge throughout my teenage years so I eagerly bought this CD. I almost threw it out the window during the first track. Their classic ""You Keep Me Hangin'On"" is edited (butchered) to the point that the verses don't even rhyme. When they did that to a classic cut I couldn't enjoy any of the other tracks. If you're a Vanilla Fudge fan forget this compilation and buy the original album versions."
1,really bad soul-psyche,"I saw these guys live in 1968, the cream . was supposed to play but did'nt show up. vanilla fudge did the whole show--i should have demanded my money back.these guys were terrible ---fake soul, over the top vocals' bombastic instrumentation,and dubious song arrangements.they had only one idea and it was'nt a good one.last year i bought this cd (used) i thought maybe i missed something---i didn't.ended up trading it back in."
5,Continues to speak after 1000 years,"The amazing thing about Su Tung-p'o is how modern he feels. Part of this is the translation by Burton Watson, but most of it is a reminder that the human condition has not changed a lot in 1000 years. We still miss our friends, marvel at the beauty of nature, feel the bittersweet loneliness of travel, and live in special moments. An excellent collection."
3,"Only the first two books; ergo, not the Chronicles","I guess I got my $'s worth. BUT, BUT, BUT I was misled. From what I read of the offering, I thought I was buying the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, which, as you know, = 7 books. This offer gives you only the first 2 books."
5,Great item,I bought this mailbox to replace my lobster. The colors are beautiful and it was easy to install. It looks great out front! Love it!
3,"Don't be fooled, not a real fish","I was going to give this five stars as I bought what I thought was a real live fish that holds mail. When my wife found out it was fake, she beat me with a broom. Oh well, life goes on."
3,Just Saying....,"I ordered this mail box as a Christmas present for my parents, being that they are avid fishermen (the perfect gift). they were thrilled! I on the other hand was quite surprised to see USA Mail imbedded on the door on the mailbox. It was not visible from the picture when I ordered it and now have a big fishing lure box with USA Mail written on it. Not that we dont get mail from the USA.... Just saying that sometimes the picture doesnt show everything. Rachelle Gauvreau"
4,True to the Real Studio 54,I have always heard stories and seen pictures from two close friends of mine. They were real bartenders in Studio 54. Onc has a Cameo in the movie. This movie captured the real feeling of the legend or Studio 54. There will never be another Night Club know around the world. This movie gives you a peak at what made this club great.
4,I WAS THERE,"Yup, I got into Studio 54 as an underage teenager just before Schrager and Rubell got busted. The direction and cinematography make this film a classic --- as close to being there as being chosen by doorman Mark Benecke out of a crowd a thousand deep. $15 cover charge in 1979! And you'd walk through the hall of mirrors like Ryan Phillippe, pass the coat check, and come upon that row of black doors, a gateway to the most fantastic party in your wildest dreams. I finally figured out one reason for the club's success -- with the undeclared cash income, the owners threw the most extravagant parties of all time, night after night. This film gives an inkling, an idea of the place, for history, though the real Studio 54 was neither as freakish or out of control as the film depicts. When you entered the place, you felt like you'd gone to heaven. After a while, it felt like home."
2,Disappointing,"I have wanted to see this movie for quite a while. As a New Yorker, I am interested in knowing what went on inside Studio 54, and so I thought I might learn more by watching the film.Unfortunately the film is mainly focused on the character and narrator (played by Ryan Phillipe) than on the club itself. Yes, it shows the viewer some of the things that went on in the club, but not enough.The acting is excellent though. Ryan Phillipe is much more than just another Hollywood pretty face; he's a good actor. But the real treat in this film is Mike Myers; his portrayal of the club's ringmaster is quite impressive. Various celebrities appear as themselves, which makes it a bit interesting. But overall, the movie is a big disappointment. I do not recommend it."
3,54 IN TRUE WIDESCREEN?,"Does anybody know if this new Miramax/Lionsgate DVD release of ""54"" is in true widescreen? (Enhanced foor 16 X 9 TV's) The first release was a widescreen picture (1.85:1) and doesn NOT fill a widescreen TV. I don't want another copy of it. Better yet why not release a Director's cut of this film on Blu-ray. Studios seem to love releasing obscure titles on Blu-ray. How about this one?"
3,THE GOOD OL' DAYS OF DISCO !,"54 wasn't a fantastic movie but for a thirty-something like me who was pretty much into disco back in the 70's , it was great to relive that time and hear some of the great songs that were out then and were featured in the movie . Though I've never been to studio 54 , but I've heard a lot about it , seeing the way it was portrayed in the movie it was obviously a happening place . I recommend that 70's nostalgia buffs and faded disco queens or kings see the movie ."
3,A good attempt to what went on at 54,"54 was an okay movie. It had its good and bad parts. Acting wasn't the best, but the music and soundtracks are awesome! It was no Fever, but hey, nothing will ever be as good as Fever. Movie was very accurate to what went on, but they could have shown more about all that went on. I would say see it if you want. Definately buy the soundtrack."
1,"54 was cool, this movie is not","This movie could have been great, but its not. It takes us on this ride of this guys life, where he gets into club 54 one night, then suddenly he's working there, and all this stuff goes on and its like, wait this movie should be called Shane. All in all this movie is piled on wth bad acting, and a confusing plot."
1,What would Studio 54 be NOW -- Here's the Answer.....,"This is supposed to be the late 70's at the legendary disco? You got to be kidding! Neve Campbell in the 70's ---aw, come on! With Philippe and her together here, I thought I was watching a ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did..."" sequel or something! Geeez! OK - Mike Myers as Steve Rubell is the one stand-out in this dreck, but unfortunately the film focuses mainly on Philippe's character and his romantic exploits instead of on the club's guru-owner. Even most of the disco music used isn't authentic for the period. What a waste! ""54"" is a dreadfully banal attempt at recreating a long-gone era and it fails miserably. The ""E True Hollywood Story"" on Rubell and Studio 54 was 100,000 times better than this teeny-bopper Gen-X attempt at recreating the 70's. Skip it!"
3,A guilty pleasure,"Though the acting is not Oscar material, the people are pretty to look at and the music is fun to listen to. This is the type of movie that is a guilty pleasure to people that won't admitt it. So if you have nothing to do on Friday nite, this will help pass two hours of your time"
1,EXCESS STUPIDITY,"Total garbage and a waste of time. It is nice to see Sela Ward, who is stunningly beautiful. And it is nice to see Mike Myers as Steve Rubell. Otherwise I can do without Neve Campbell, not just in this role but in all roles. Salma Hayek is her beautiful self but otherwise just ornamentation. And Ryan Philippe, well, he has to pay the bills somehow."
3,It could be much better.,"This movie has NO PLOT. It's boring, Salma Hayek is horrible in it, where is all the decadence and excess??? I swear to God the E TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY was way more shocking than this movie. They should have filmed it from Steve Rubell's perspective. How did Ryan Philipe's character get accepted into NYU if he can't even talk properly? Neve Cambell is pitiful.I gave this 3 stars because of meyers's perfomance and it does has a great soundtrack. Aside that it is a BIG disapointment."
1,Could have been better,"54 could have been a lot better. I watched this movie late at night to get the feel of it, but there wasn't much to feel for. What I got was a fictional story between Hayek, Philippe, and Campbell. When you try to mix fiction (the above characters) in with fact (Steve Rubell and the Studio 54 legend), it mucks up what could've been a great movie. The movie should have concentrated its script on what Studio 54 was. Rather than showing Philippe getting it on with Sela Ward (Poor Sela must've been hard up to get this role) and trying to score with Campbell. Don't get me wrong, it was an okay film. It's just that a whole lot of potential was wasted on a fictional story (a la Titanic), rather than dealing with the facts. If you really want to know what Studio 54 was like, check out VH1's ""Behind the Music"" special on it. It gives you more detail on the club that we all wished we could've got into."
4,"Great film, great soundtrack","Fantastic film set around the 70's night club ""54"". Surprisingly well acted especially Mike Meyers as the night club's owner and Ryan Phillippe as the new kid on the block.The music is just as good and so the soundtrack is a must have.It seems that the director was not able to release his cut of the film and so the US DVD version (the best I've seen so far) is the closest we are going to get. However what remains is still great and definitely worth seeing."
2,"full of promise, but fails to deliver","I agree with one of the other reviewers: the movie was cut to shreds, re-shot in places, and generally is a different movie than intended. A Director's Cut may restore the project to its original promise. On the plus side, it shows more of the ""inside"" of the disco scene, whereas ""The Last Days...."" looked at things from the customer side. Let's hope the next decade holds something more enlightening than this drug (including alcohol and tobacco!) saturated scene!"
4,"54 - INTERESTING; HOWEVER, I WAS HOPING FOR MORE.","All in all, I think this is a good movie. If you were old enough to know about Studio 54, then probably, you wanted to see the club for yourself...especially if you were into disco. I can't believe I was in New York several times when 54 was going strong, and I didn't try to watch the crowds from a distance. My friends were afraid to go out at night. Geez!"
3,Miramax cut this to shreds but still worth a look,"This film has some outstanding music and sets but the story has been severely compromised by the studio to show the main character, Shane (Ryan Phillippe) in a better light (less drugs, bisexuality). I enjoyed this film because I am a Phillippe fan and Myers is great too. It could have been SO much better, hope the DVD restores some of the lost scenes."
2,a decent film,"definitely not a bad film, but a masterpiece is different.The plot is non existant, even if it should be a real story.the music is good, disco mainly. the characters are alright. Mike Myers performs well, being the owner of the club, into drugs, socialitè and gay sex. Overall, you don't regret having spent 90 minutes watching it, but you don't think you will watch it again any time soon in the next 10 years."
1,As empty-headed as disco was,"This is a good example where a first-time director gets a heap of money (from Miramax) to ""document"" a particular subculture and fails miserably. From of all its hype, Studio 54 was supposed to be another world entirely, a place where excess and truly eccentric characters thrived. What the viewer gets is a film that completely glosses over all eccenticities and parades a collection of woefully underdeveloped characters across the screen. Ryan Phillipe is a poor actor and cannot hope to anchor the film; Salma Hayek, neve Campbell and the rest of the cast have so little material to work with that they become nothing more than window dressing. The only saving grace 54 has is Mike Meyer's surprisingly effective performance -- I'd like to see Meyers do more than his Austin Powers shtick. For a truly superior look at disco subculture, check out Whit Stillman's The Last Days of Disco, a film that shows disco as a social outlet in the lives of twentysomethings in 1981."
4,"Those Rockin' 70s, Where Are They Now?","It was the crazy 70s. Disco was king, the Bee Gees were holding center court, and Donna Summer was queen. Then there was club 54 where only the prettiest and best were allowed to enter. Liquor, sex, and drugs were always on the playlist and it became a staple of all the deviant behaviors of the era. The real star of this movie IS the music. It pulsates throughout the picture, giving it life in some of the dead spots. One amazing performance by Mike Meyers (Groovy Baby) as Steve was suprisingly overlooked. Meyers studied this character and had him down. He didn't even look like himself. If you miss the 70s/80s, put this on and go to the way-back machine."
1,Butchered for your protection,"Trying to make a film concerning Studio 54 for a mainstream audience is a really bad idea. It's just not possible to do it and actually stay truthful to the climate of that era. Gays had a lot more influence on that scene than the film lets on. From what I understand, the original director's cut was gutted by Miramax before the film was released it and it shows. Other than Mike Meyers portrayal of Steve Rubell, there's hardly a gay character in sight. There's some very good actors in the film and their talents are simply wasted. Thank goodness the good music helped me get through this drivel. Anyone with a taste for fine filmmaking need not bother with this cinematic mistake."
1,truly Forgettable,if it weren't for Mike Myers this film would have gone to the 3:am Pile quickly.this film is Horrible.the story is never fully developed.E Entertainment&VH1 did far better jobs than this film.very flat.Myers deserves props for his Performance.but the film misses the boat.a Golden Chance to Highlight a Time Period Blown.
1,Production money wasted,"I must say that I was very dissapointed with this movie. Neve Campbell's role was very minuscule. Poor Screenplay, poor acting-poor-poor-poor. This was just another one of those over hyped movies."
1,Just Crap,"This movie is just plain dumb. I would give it zero stars, but, sadly, that's not an option. Don't waste your time, or money on this film A great dissapointment.It's also the waste of a good idea (a movie based on the happenings at Studio 54 would be cool if it was actually written semi-interstingly) and a waste of excellent actors (Mike Myers, Neve Campbell, Ryan Phillipe, Selma Heyak, Brecken Myer, Heather Metazzario. Must I go on?)DON'T SEE THIS FILM!!!!!"
5,Love the Dutch version,"Voel je hoe de liefde groeit?I have this Dutch version of ""The Lion King"" and it is great. It's like you are in a South African safari when you hear the songs.""Alles Adempt En Leeft Nants Ingonyama"" has a nice mix of African and Dutch lyrics. ""Het Nieuws Van De Dag"" also has a nice interchange of lyrics in the native language. It was very interesting to hear the rapid lyrics done to music."
2,more of a kids introduction to mysteries,"This short 102 page book is a breaf look into 18 ancient people dissapearances that has somewhat sketchy explanations for the mysteries. Really only a kids book of the sort that might introduce them to some ancient mysteries...and not very compelling ones at that. That, or they are spoken of in less than gripping terms.The explanations seem more like guess work or acceptance of conventional explanations, and no real cause for wonder and mystery is put forth to make anyone want to look deeper into the mysteries.overal pretty weak."
3,"A true lift of spirit, but ending in a plummet to the rocks.","""Pope Patrick"" is by far the funniest and most cynical review of the Vatican to reach print in the past hundred years. It leaves you rolling in your seat, and at the same time reaffirms one's belief that things can turn out right despite everyone who stands in the way.Unfortunately, the ""surprise ending"" in the last few pages completely shatters the aforementioned good feelings, and instills a depression that hasn't been matched since ""Apocalypse Now.""If you truly want to make someone's Friday and Saturday but destroy their Sunday, hand them ""Pope Patrick""."
5,The best.,"This is simply the best book I have ever read. Hands down, no questions asked. I loved every page of it."
4,Great TV for the bedroom,"I bought this TV last week to my bedroom and i just love it, the picture is great, have a lot of imput easy to use and set. i strongly recommend this TV for video games and live tv. the only thing i didn't like is that it only have one hdmi input."
3,"Picure fine, audio heavy.",Have this TV about a year. The picture is beautiful but the audio is too bassy. This is especially evident when watching movies. Have adjusted the audio every way possible and the treble is not as responsive as a four year old Sony that I have. Other HDTV TVs that my friends own have a much sharper audio quality.
4,What are the differences between the S400 and S2010 series?,"Could someone please tell me the differences between the S400 and S2010 series LCD televisions? From what little I could deduce, the S2010 is a little less expensive than the S400, but the S2010 seems to have better owner reviews. Any enlightenment would be appreciated!"
4,Sony Review,"We have the set in our bedroom and have hooked it up to a surround sound system and just love it. The picture is marvelous. Two things prevent us from giving it 5 stars. Jacks for surround sound so you can easily hook things up. Easier navigating from video 1 through 7. Maybe these things exist and as we read the manual in more depth we will find them, but they are not intuitively obvious. We still recommend the set."
5,great tv,"I debated over buying another model, but this one is really worth the extra cost. The delivery service was poor. They had the wrong number and only after a couple of phone calls on my part did they set up a delivery date"
5,"Excellent Sony product, great Amazon service",I ordered the Sony KDL-32S2010 from Amazon after seeing one in a friend's home and doing lots of research. This is an excellent product. The price from Amazon was very good and the set was received on time in excellent condition. I use a cable service and have found the HD channels are just superb. Non-HD channels are very good if that channel is very good on your cable system. Channels that are weak on cable look no better because the weakness is more obvious than on older sets due to the number of pixels on the screen. All digital channels look better than before. As an example in my case my cable system's AMC channel is excellent while the SciFi channel is weak. I also use a DVR from my cable company and combined with the Sony couldn't be happier. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this product.
3,Close Fit Replacement,"Foam Sleeve filter was a little hard to fit on the unit, had to move it a little bit at a time all around the gage. Once on, it worked perfectly."
4,Appears as Described!,"Not much to say about a filter, it arrived timely, fits, and seems to work as expected. Price was good, as are about all Amazon buys. I would recommend to those in need!"
5,"A gripping saga of the long, hard road to personal independence","New Beginnings is a novel about the vicious reality of domestic violence. A blissful wedding and ordinary marriage sours day by day into a gradual nightmare; no matter how hard Heather tries to please her husband with her appearance, personality, or cooking, the relationship deteriorates. Even when it worsens into beatings, Heather clings to the memory of the man she married, rather than the monster he has become. Yet it takes a terrible tragedy, which strikes even as a criminal secret from Heather's past surfaces, that force Heather to choose between enduring endless abuse and striking out to take back control of her own life. A gripping saga of the long, hard road to personal independence."
3,"Fine acting, but the directing?","While this is a good adaptation of the novel several scenes are poorly done. The film was shot in Viet Nam, yet the locations are not correct. In Saigon the Continental is on the wrong side of the square! With the real Continental in the background. For reasons that escape me the Caravel Hotel stands in for the Continental.A major scene from the book is Fowler's drive to Tay Ninh to meet with General The. In the story line a key factor is the need to drive there and back in one day. But the movie moves this from Tay Ninh to northern Viet Nam. Its impossible to drive that far and back in one day in any country. After traveling the long distance to Viet Nam for location filming it escapes my why the producers did not use Tay Ninh or at least a location that looks like Tay Ninh.For me these major errors distracted from an otherwise fine film."
5,Great DVD,"""The Quiet American""; Is a great film about American history in Veit Nam. This is a must see for all history movie buff."
5,"Dark, interesting and very seductive! A great movie!",JUST BUY OR RENT THE MOVIE AND STOP READING REVIEWS!
2,The Too Quiet American,"This movie was/is touted as being one of the best, early era Vietnam movies of all time. Unfortunately, I found it to be very slow and drawn out. There was very little war related action, a shallow story line, and way too much relationship action between Michael Caine's and Brendan Fraser's characters vying for the attention of the heroine, Do Thi Hai Yen. Really - when would Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser EVER be in contention for the same woman?Way too close to being an all out chick-flick for this viewer, but if you liked ""The English Patient"" (y-a-w-n) then you will probably like this movie. If you liked ""Saving Private Ryan"", you're probably going to sleep through this one."
1,"Bad story, and racist","This is a rather boring story, although the cinematography and fireworks are kinda neat. Not sure where it was shot but some of the scenries are pretty beautiful. My biggest problem with this movie is it's rather racist: a (...) Southeast Asian woman who loves intercourse with a white man 4x her age, and Asian men depicted as ignorant and brutal. (...)"
4,Quiet publicizing,"It's a shame this movie isn't getting more of the attention it deserves. A well made suspense drama, that leaves you saying ""I sould have figured that out"" and asking yourself ""would i have made the choice Michael Caine made""? I'm not exactly a fan of either of these stars, but they did an impressive job here. I really can't imagine anyone playing the roles better. The well balanced intrigue between war and the three-way romance, made this movie highly engrossing. If you were interested enough to click the reviews for this movie, then let the debate end, and go see this movie. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
4,"Worthy effort, but the book was better","This was a good movie, but the book was better. The casting, however, was quite perfect, even though Michael Caine is technically too old for the role of Fowler (who is supposed to be in his mid fifties as opposed to Caine's 70) he plays the role superbly. Frasier is the perfect cast for Pyle, as he is supposed to be the poster boy for American culture, which I see him as. They did stick quite close to the book's plot on this one, but the producers left out some small ""nit picky"" details that although like I said are ""small"" are somewhat crucial to the plot, especially when it comes to the explosion in the square. I wouldn't pass up this movie because it is quite good, but I would also pick up the book and see what they missed."
3,Nice Movie - Not So Nice Message,"Quality sets, quality direction, quality acting. Caine was excellently cast. Frasier carries the role fairly well. However, I still think Frasier is best in comedic roles.The message! Typical Greene...America is less than good. Greene was in Vietnam, apparently, during the period just before America's overt involvement in Vietnam. Greene, the novelist, was also a spy. Little known fact...Greene was recruited by well-known British KGB agent Kim Philby.Why would Philby recruit Greene unless he was sure Greene would serve his cause...the cause of anti-capitalism? Greene performed admirably in his spy role, writing novels such as ""The Quiet American"" which slam America albeit in a ""quiet"" back-handed way, which is sometimes the most effective.The movie is worth a watch. Just don't take the message at face-value, but with the knowledge that Philby may have sanctioned Greene to write novels such as this full of anti-American undertones at the height of the Cold War."
3,"slow, but great scenery","This was a solid film with good acting from Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, but it was hardly the thriller I expected. It has all the right ingredients for a dynamic film with all the cloak and dagger stuff done by the CIA, but the film never took that direction. The film's tempo was pretty slow, and it seemed too much of a ""chick flick"" than I wanted. Having said that, it was worth seeing for the simple fact that it was all shot in Vietnam and the french colonial architecture really helps set the spirit of the times."
4,Different than the Book,"I enjoyed both the movie and the book. I found it interesting that, though the they were based on similar plot lines, the movie presented a different story about the British journlist Fowler than that told by the book upon which the movie was based. I found such an interpretive approach risky and refreshing.The difference is most easily demonstrated during the closing scenes. In the movie, Fowler is presented as having grown from cynicism to moral belief by becoming crusading journalist dedicated to exposing the Viet Nam war. At the end of the book, Fowler is presented as seeking redemption for his role in the murder of Pyle, and, by implication, his life in general - he desperately wants to say ""I'm sorry.""As I said, risky and refreshing. Interpretive film making can grow beyond the bounds of the work upon which it is based."
2,Not as good as it sounds,"Instead of buying this book, I went to the library to check it out and after reading the other reviews, I was very disappointed. This book has little to do with ""sanity saving"" it's mostly just letters of unique situations written to the author of this book. He replies with common sense advice and even sometimes advice that ""beats around the bush"" (indirect advice). For the average healthy bride I recommend reading the book by the Knot (don't remember what it is called but it has ""The Knot"" in the title). I also got that at the library and it has absolutely everything! No need to get another book. It offers real ""sanity saving"" advice and some real life stories for all situations. But if I have to say something positive about the other book, it does have a cute cover... but thats about it."
3,O.k...but not great.,This book was o.k. The information was the only good thing. The flow of the book just was a jumble.
2,Many boring parts...,And where are those harrowing photographs advertised on the cover? I've read much better true crime books. The psychological analysis gets really boring. Writing is unimaginative at best.
3,Good specific serial killer information,"This book, while good, was not what I was expecting. It had good detail information on specific serial cannibal killers, but fell short of the ""hows and whys"" serial killers eat the flesh of their victims. The entire book was based on specific cannibal serial killer facts and then, in the final chapter, the author tried to cram in his view on ""why."" So, if you don't know much about the killers mentioned in this book, it will be a good book for you. But if you are interested in psychological profiles and detailed analysis on the same above mentioned killers, this book, unfortuneately, lacks any substance."
3,"Scary, but is it good?","Are you ready to plumb the absolute lowest depths of mankind? Then this is a good start. The quality of the writting is somewhat lacking, unfocused and repetetive, but the unflinching description of some of the most naseauting, heart breaking attrocities pepetrated by cannibal killers such as the reprehensible( to say the least) Dauhmer, and Peter Stump are worth the cover price alone for those who enjoy exploring the warped world of human monsters, and what drives them to do what they do. Especially revolting is the fate of a Japanese flesh eater who's repugnant 'fetish' vaulted him into superstardom in his native country, where he is regarded as an artist(!!!). Not an extradodinary book, but moving, and addictive."
4,not to bad book for magnets designers!,"I have read this book, not a bad book, there are couple of good chapters, the ones for thermenal stability,magnetic circuits and applications.but I do recommend ""Introduction to magnetism and magnetic material"" as starter book because this book deals with the theory behind magnets applications. So once you read this book, your able to understand campbell's one."
5,Just What I Needed,"The book had just what I needed to read to better understand magnetic materials so that I could make critical choices using them. While the math throughout this book was rigorous for a paperback, I especially found the applications chapter valuable."
3,husband didn't really like,my husband didn't really like this razor. he said that the cooling strip actually gives a burning sensation.
1,The face of disappoinment!,"The face of power tells the tale of a young man and his nonsensical and often anti-social behavior somehow leading him to a higher knowledge. Matt Guest clearly has a problem with the opposite sex and identifies with his female relationships as ""energy draining"". His account of romantically embracing a close male friend in a kiss is most certainly his moment of clarity. It would have been more honest of a read if he just accepted his homosexuality and moved on. Instead the reader is given uninspiring pieces of drivel such as, ""where do all the birds go when they die""? This book came highly recommended and sadly it offered nothing useful or even mildly entertaining. However, if you like self-indulgent, sexually confused, new age ramblings, then you'll love this book."
3,Overrated but still interesting,This guy obviously has some valuable personal experience and it is nice that he shares it with us so openly. But that's what this book is mostly all about - his personal experience. There is no structured approach or new theory. The book is definitely not instructional but rather anecdotal. I read both his books but was somewhat disappointed as the titles led me to expect more. Obviously the road to power is a very different personal experience for every one.
1,what's the difference???,"My 14 year old toy poodle has been diagnosed with early kidney disease and has not been eating. Her weight dropped to 4.2 lbs so my groomer suggested I try Nutri-cal. I first tried the Puppy version and she loved it! But after she finished that tube, I bought the Adult version and she turns up her nose at it. I can't tell that there is any difference between the 2 nutritionally, but obviously there must be an odor difference that turns her off."
5,Great Product,"My dog doesn't always eat a lot so I give him nutrical and he loves it. I feed him Innova, but i guess high quality food isn't good enough for my boy lol."
1,Not what the Dr. ordered!,"Received the product in good time and well packed. My vet said this was not really a good product for my dog though; all sugar. On an very elderly dog, it can actually create more problems so check with vet first."
4,Important notes,"Nuwisha are a blast to play, but if you're hoping for all you need to play them, this book is Necessary, but not sufficient. You're also going to need the players guide to Werewolf, since the Nuwisha book doe NOT contain all of their gifts. NOR does it contain creation rules. It does however, list their Totems, a few gifts, and Nuwisha Only merits and flaws. It also has their creation mythos, and a few secrets. AND AS AN ADDED BONUS, It has Old-man-manyskins in it. Yay, huh?"
2,Dissapointing,"This could have been so much better...I like the humor element, but there isn't enough depth to the book, or the nuwisha. I'll stick with the Kitsune and Ananasi as my changing breeds."
4,A Good Book,"This book is loads of fun, But is a little sketchy on charter creation.Even if you don't play a Nuwisha, I recomend this book for pure entertainment value."
2,"Essential, yet poorly written.","Sorry kids, but Nuwisha is NOT clear and concise. The umbral danse remains unknown territory (till Werewolf Players Guide 2nd Edition), much of the info in the PG was NOT included in Nuwisha, and it was over all poorly organised. Though the over all content of the book was good, and useful, this one needs to be sent in for a makeover."
1,Blows chunks,"Dont buy this dog. Remote buttons too close together, illogically placed with no range renders it almost useless, it will make you mad. Manual is abysmal, mine was missing pages, and even stapled incorrectly with two cover sheets- it doesnt matter though as it is useless. Support dont even go there they dont have a clue and any question resolves itself to we will replace the unit (you pay shipping) even if it is obviously a firmware or knowledge issue. Phillips sells the identical unit (sampo) with a decent manual and available firmware upgrades, with a better looking remote. If you can get it for a comparable price, buy it instead."
2,Buy something else,"I've owned two of these. I returned the first one after about six months after the rear fan bearing died and started making a terrible noise. My replacement did the same thing after four months! I stuck a toothpick into the fan, not only making the squealing go away but also removing the fan noise completely (which was quite loud even out of the box). The problem now is that it freezes more often than before, and it always chooses the most inconvenient time to freeze. It doesn't burn usable disks with DVD-R, although some say that it works well with DVD+R disks, I haven't tried. The final straw is that when a timed event is activated a small icon shows on the screen ALL THE TIME. Annoying."
3,"Interesting story, but not life-changing","I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this book, but because of all the stellar reviews here I expected to enjoy it more than I did. I have to say that it was a very honestly written book, and for that I have to respect the author. She tells the story of a very personal odyssey. I wish I'd known beforehand that it had such a heavily Christian theme though, I probaby wouldn't have bought it. That's just my personal taste. Also, I had some problems with her writing, it could have used some editing for clarity.Bottom line, it was an interesting story, but not gripping. Nothing I'd be moved to recommend to anyone else."
1,The worst book I have ever read,"I wish I didn't even have to give this book 1 star. It doesn't deserve that. I don't know who wrote the back summary of the book, but that person completely misrepresented it. This was a completely childish, poorly written piece of sholck that I read for my book club. We all hated it. It was truly awful. There is no ""message for dreamers, cynics, belivers and sceptics"" or any one. Do not pay money for this book. I can't warn you enough that the book description is NOTHING like the book itself. Don't be fooled as we were that this was a book worth reading."
3,The Grass Dance,"The story was interesting, you can read it in an hour, but it doesn't deserve five stars."
3,Times nave been a-changing backwards lately,"Bob Dylan is not always very well inspired these days. To invest his song and music in a fictitious Latin American situation with a dying general dictator, a civil war without any ideology, some dumb sharks trying to exploit some artists to organize a free concert in support of ... of what? It tries to show how Latin America is rotten, how our times have changed so much that we have lost all ethical ideology, how show business is meaningless, how even a revolutionary guerilla warfare has no real ideological objective and yet the film sets some religious objectives to this revolution. And it all ends in a fiasco. Bob Dylan is no great actor and that is not new. His music are interesting but this film is betraying them 100%.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"
4,It's Bob Dylan,"I think simply put, if you like Bob Dylan and just want to have fun with a movie, then you'll love it. The performances Bob gives are excellent, and it's great to see the ensemble of actors they lined up all together.If your not much of a Dylan fan, and like your movies high and mighty, better just pass it up..."
4,what a gem,"most people agree this a marvellous film, yes Bob Dylans voice sounds crap, but the movie has atmosphere,honesty, and dry humour, and well cast too, Bridges and Goodman just seem to work so well together, Bridges and Lange too, Penelope Cruz is terrifically weird, and when that little girl sings ""times they are a changin'"", i mean, how gorgeous is that? Great cameos from Chris Penn and Val Kilmer, just a wonderfully weirdo movie"
2,Worth A Look,"This film is full of good ideas - sadly they never come together. However, there's enough interesting content to warrant a look if you're into Bob Dylan, experimental films, political satire or any of the lead actors (although they are sometimes left to flounder with little or no direction the writers & director are genrous to the leads, giving them plenty to do and lots of screen time). The frighteningly Bush-like speech by the new president (too complicated to explain) given at the climax makes this film worth watching."
4,Quirky and original.,"Great cast....Bob Dylan, Jessica Lange, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. One of those wonderful, odd little movies that are big on ideas and small on 'special effects.' Plus, you can't go wrong with Bob Dylan singing ""I wish I was in Dixie!"""
3,"Um, well......","MASKED AND ANONYMOUS is long, often incoherent, open to interpretation, visually over the top and more than a little pretentious. I kind of like it.I doubt there's much point in debating whether or not this is a masterpiece. Since when has ANYTHING about Bob Dylan been easy to define? What I do find is that it's very much in the spirit of his most allegorical song lyrics from the mid-Sixties, and about as anarchic. If you enjoyed Mr. D during that period in his life, or even some of his post-Sixties music where the songs' meanings were highly subjective, you might well like this movie. Or not...this is a movie, after all, and not an album. But you might be pleasantly surprised by its staying power after you finish watching it. In sum, this movie is worth a second, or third or more time screening it, before deciding whether or not there is more meat on these bones."
1,Makes Plan 9 From Outer Space seem like Shakespeare,"What a great cast! I mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie, right? After it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it, although you are shaking your head in disbelief! Stunning! You've never seen anything quite like it! If you are a fan of the campy awful, you may see it as a masterpiece, if not you will still have a unique viewing experience.Proceed at your own risk! Borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it.Did I mention the great cast? So many of my favorites...even Goodman can't save this clunker."
1,Yet another disastrous Dylan-related film project,"Bob Dylan is undoubtedly a musical genius but his film projects usually operate at the other end of the quality spectrum and ""Masked and Anonymous"" is no exception. A terrible script (co-written by Dylan) with pretentions way above its low budget and Dylan's non-acting wreck this film. That some reviewers give this film five stars is hard to understand to say the least. Maybe, like Dylan appears to be doing, they are playing some kind of joke on the public. You have been warned!"
3,"the music, man; the music is where its at","overblown and silly, BUT it does have bob dylan (actually ok in this one), and thats the reason to watch it. bobby performs bits and pieces of 8 songs, and since only 4 of these show up on the soundtrack album, its a must-see for any dylan fan. also featuring some really interesting covers of songs by other acts, including a little girl who sings a beautiful a capella ""times they are a-changin"" (which ALSO doesnt appear on the cd, grr!). recommended for a select audience."
5,IT'S AAWWWWFFFUUUULLLL!!!!!!!!,"This just has to be the worst movie ever made. Why then, you may ask, am I giving it five stars? Because, my simple friends, it is HILARIOUS! Honestly, it is so hysterical in its shameless badness I was in stitches throughout the whole thing. And Dylan's voice! It was BAD! And didn't you just love his acting when the kid on the train got shot? His expression never changes. I swear; he looks over his shoulder then looks forward again and it NEVER CHANGES. HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Bob has done WAAAAYYY too much acid.I leave you with a few quotes I actually took time and energy to commit to memory: ""...I feel like a man who has lived 10000 years, has 17 senses and is standing knee-deep in the Atlantic..."" ""...they tell you life is pointless, that gravity is meaningless..."" ""Violence is the only tool in their box. You can't build a house with only one tool. Well, I have a tool TOO!"" (Walks outside with M16 and is promptly killed by the ""rebel insurgents"".)"
1,Inconceivably self indulgent,"Are people giving this movie good ratings because they think they ought to, or because they honestly find it interestingly done? I love Bob Dylan and Jeff Bridges and many of the other people involved in this film, but this is easily one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.A lot of people are going to ""say"" they like this because they will feel their cultural coolness is at risk if they don't. But most people are going to hate it. Why? Because it is just dreadful."
4,For True Dylan Fans,"Only true Bob Dylan fans can really appreciate this film. The entire plot revolves around Dylan as the legendary musical talent, Jack Fate. The cast of the show is amazing-it is packed with leading stars such as John Goodman, Val Kilmer, Jeff Bridges, Penelope Cruz, and Luke Wilson. All of the songs are either traditional folk songs preformed by Dylan and his bad, or adaptations of older Dylan song. I suggest everyone see this movie even if it has been given a bad review. It has a very interesting plotline and some very good dialogue, not to mention great music!"
1,Buy the music not the movie.,"I love dylan, he is a great song writer and I listen to his music more than I probably should. However the movie is a waste of talent. It seems like it was done by a bunch of college students with a case of beer and no thought given to story or sense. It is not a movie with a message other than some sort of wasted 1960s fantasy of us against the man. The shots of dylan and his band are great. If they had stopped there it would be worth it, however, like so much in entertainment it is pretentious and sophomoric. Buy a music CD instead."
1,DON'T GIVE UP YOUR DAY JOB,"Maybe in the future we'll be able to wake up in the morning, press rewind and watch our dreams on our dream recording machine. Until then, we have filmmakers like Bob Dylan, who have the accessibility to monstrously construct the elaborate and profound thought process they have experienced. How can such a cold and lifeless movie come from such a warm and gracious artist? As a visual feast to Dylan's most recent work, it manages to exclude his entire heart. Great sound and extraordinary soundtrack does not a movie make."
1,Love the music hate the movie,"Perhaps this will help some folks who are considering this movie. I understood the premise just fine, but the awful dialog and sincere but pathetic acting (John Goodman seems like a nice guy, but it doesn't mean you should watch all of his movies, and Jessica Lange was as surprising as a cardboard cutout) reminded me of one of those movies that disappears quickly only to re-emerge as a depressing Sunday matinee you find on cable TV while folding your laundry. Bad acting, stereotypes, tired concepts. Maybe we missed out, but we couldn't watch the whole thing."
1,Embarrasing film for all involved,"I'm a big Bob Dylan fan and read the reviews but still thought ""Hey-it's Bob Dylan-can't be that bad"". I was wrong. This film is embarrasing. Jessica Lange is an excellent actress, and Bob Dylan is a genius songwriter. BUT THIS MOVIE STINKS ! Doesn't deserve 1 star"
4,Waky realistic sense of Being,"I agree with viewer from Atanta and viewer from Luisville as with georgiasam 5 . Good movie for the curious thinker . And it seems to me Jake goes to Jail for sleeping with his fathers girlfriend . He is the joung man in the hotel room seen from a memory perspective . Kilmer is what Morrison would have turned into if he was alive , no coincidence here , etc... Too bad Dylan is so hard to understand when he sings , whats new , Right ? ."
2,Broken Upon Receipt,"I dont know what the quality of these canisters is like because I never got to use them. As soon as I was handed the box, I heard clattering and when I opened it, the canisters were shattered. Clearly the packaging is not adequate."
5,Simplistic Canisters,"These canisters are absolutely gorgeous. They are not too heavy, which makes it easy to take them down from a shelf. Their neutral color allows them to blend with any color."
3,Mostly Happy,"I am happy with the overall quality of the product, but am disappointed in the color. The color online shows a much deeper green. The canisters I received have more of a gray undertone..."
3,"They'll Do, For the Price.","I was looking for some attractive canisters to set out on my counter top. The price was right, as the avacado canisters were marked down to $15.99 when I ordered (and I got FREE shipping). If I had to pay full price I would have been disappointed.Pros: Great price, the color matches my kitchen.Cons: Poor fit and finish (one of the lids doesn't seal well), rather small.All in all, I am happy with my purchase."
4,Darkness Over Denmark,A very thorough and comprehensive look at the heroic efforts of the Danish people during the Nazi occupation of Denmark during WWII. A great resource for parents reading Lois Lowry's Number the Stars. Moving and inspiring.
1,vegetarian make up,Not the color it appeared on line. Is very fragile. The powder broke up in my make up bag in less than a week. That has never happened to me before.
3,Now for something completely different.,"This is a recording of a Turtles concerts from circa 1991. The only original Turtles here are Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, aka Flo and Eddie. The band runs through almost all of the Turtles hits (except for ""You Know What I Mean""), plus some Flo & Eddie songs. It's a decent concert, with several comedy bits. But something is missing without the visual aspect of actually seeing their silly antics."
3,"Not bad, but nothing special","Sure, it's funny, and Mark and Howard are in fine voice as usual, but this release still feels pretty superfluous. Because despite how entertaining it is, it's still a group of talented people who've resigned themselves to being an ""oldies comedy act"" going through the motions. It should be fairly telling that many lesser-known musical highlights from Flo and Eddie's long and entertaining career aren't here, in favor of MOR schmaltz and, of course, their biggest hits from the Turtles days. They've tossed aside highlights like ""Strange Girl"" and ""Illegal, Immoral, and Fattening"" and if *they* don't care about their past, who's supposed to hold the legacy?Beh. It's entertaining, but don't let yourself spend too much for it."
2,"Great designs, but better material needed for making the cards",I agree with all the glowing evaluations here of the design of this Tarot deck. The problem I had when I bought a MG deck was that shuffling the cards caused the layers of paper out of which the cards were made to start peeling apart at the upper corners. No other Tarot deck I've ever used has had this problem. I would *love* to buy another MG deck if the manufacturer would simply use better material for making the actual physical cards!
4,Great Images but Cheesy Backs,"These would be one of my very favorite decks if the backs of the cards did not look so out of character with the beautiful, rich and colorful images. I love the colors and I particularly love the lack of border--it gives the cards and the whole deck such character! Even the box with its lovely deep purple, decorative swirls and greenery on the sides (which would have been a much better choice for a back design) are in keeping with the theme."
5,Not your average remix CD.,"The remixes on this CD are amazing! ""Bellbottoms"" is transformed by U.N.K.L.E. quite well! Killah Priest was an unusual but well worth addition to ""Greyhound."" But the star track of the CD is ""Flavor part 2,"" where Beck and Mike D. create something incredible. When you're like me and are a huge fan of Beck, the Beastie Boys, and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, having them all working together on one song, it's almost spiritual! I heard a Beck that I had never heard before. I am a huge fan of this CD; how can I not be?"
5,"Not conventional, but great","This was the first album I bought from the JSBX, adn I will never regret this for the rest of my life. This album has a nice but raw sound and is loaded with laughter. If you wish to experience the magic groups have on tour, you must buy this album."
2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!","As much as I hate to admit it (being a die-hard JSBX fan) this album was a major disappointment. ""Experimental Remixes"" isn't anywhere near the standards of the ordinary JSBX- albums. Sure, the title says it's an experiment- and it sounds like it- but the result is a collection of extremely dull versions of songs from the ""Orange"" album. There is NOTHING left of the raw power from the Blues Explosion, not even Beck's versions of ""Flavor"" makes any impact- they are, just like the rest of this frustratingly bad album, pale immitations! Don't waste your money- if you like me just can't get enough Blues Explosion I suggest you buy ""Orange"" twice!!!"
2,Big disappointment,"This book is not a guide, but a collection of highly dated articles published on a magazine. You will need to read all articles to find a tip here and there. Most articles talk about prices, and since the book was published in 2003, they don't make any sense anymore, making most article dated and useless. You will get a lot more information by reading and posting on Ferrari Life forums online and buying their inexpensive buying guides."
3,"The patterns are great but, . . . .","I received this book as a gift and was really excited about it. The patterns are fun, but please check the following website for corrections to the pattern BEFORE starting anything [...]. I found errors in 3 patterns I have attempted to make. Don't waste the time and energy working off the wrong pattern."
3,Not as good as the first... but still good,"Stitch 'n Bitch Nation features 50 hip, new, even funkier and more fabulous patterns by Stitch 'n Bitch designers, who come from San Francisco to Brooklyn, Chicago to Cambridge to St. Paul, Minnesota. The Om Yoga Mat Bag. Felted Monster Slippers. The London Calling Union Jack Sweater, because even punks get cold in winter. A Double-Duty Shrug. Polka Dot Tankini. That '70s Poncho. The Boob Tube. Spiderweb Capelet, Cabled Newsboy Cap, Chunky Baby Booties and Baby Bunny Hat. And the most ingenius project, a Knit-Your-Own Rock Star doll--with a choice of Joey Ramone or Henry Rollins. All designs are complete with full-color photographs and step-by-step instructions, and are made from sexy, contemporary yarns, including multicolored angora, alpaca, lace, and mohair. Includes the best tips, shortcuts, and techniques from Stitch 'n Bitchers, profiles of knitters and their groups, and a how-to refresher on all the stitches used in the book."
4,Fun book,"This is a fun book and great for beginners or the more advanced knitter. It has a glossary of stitches for those times you just can't remember how a particular stitch is supposed to go. The only reason that I gave it four stars is because the selection of patterns isn't all that great. I bought the book to have some basic ""go to"" items and didn't end up making any of them. I now have a grand daughter that loves hats with ears so I will probably make that one now."
4,"great new projects, with a human angle","This knitting book, with a title that just makes my kids cringe, has a fun take on patterns. I like the little vignettes that introduce the creators of the pieces. I like the tips on making things work for the reader/crafter. I like the series, but I wish the title wasn't one that makes us reach for the magic marker."
3,"A fun read, but weird projects","I love the chatty tone of this book, as well as the knitting tips featured in boxed areas on each page. But the patterns are just too kooky for the investment of yarn and time required. Crocodile mittens? A knitted bikini? A caplet that looks like an algae attack? The projects here are just a little too out there--a few novelty projects would be great, but the bulk of these are just too hipster and too strange. Even so, I enjoyed reading about the designers themselves and country-wide SNB groups featured in the book. I will probably try the little devil pants though (but I've heard it has some mistakes in it).Not worth buying unless you really need a Joey Ramone knitted doll . . ."
4,"Excellent book, very helpful",This is a great knitting tool and fun to use too. I highly recommend it to knitting enthusiasts.
1,title not appropriate,"I would like to buy this book, but the title is not appropriate for me to have in my home."
2,Pretty pointless,"I loved the first Stitch and Bitch, so like a mindless fan, I skipped right out and bought this Stitch 'n Bitch Nation book... the patterns are ridiculous though and I feel like they're only good for pulling out elements to assemble your own Frankenstein type design that you might actually wear. Plus there are all kinds of wacky things going on with the project directions, all kinds of errata that it's crazy. It also struck me that a lot of the models just didn't pull off the designs either. So watch out for this book! I'm glad though, it taught me to check out the next ones from the library which I feel really helped with the Son of Stitch n Bitch (it sucked even worse)."
4,"Great tips, user friendly","Like the first Stitch-N-[...] book, this one did not disappoint. I love Debbie's instructions and tips for customizing patterns, substituting yarns of different gauges, etc. I really liked some of the patterns and really disliked others...but I guess that is like with any knitting pattern book. All in all though, a great book. Debbie really takes the fear out of gauge math!"
3,It's somewhere between 3-4 stars,"I'll admit that the first time I looked through this book I did not want to buy it. The patterns didn't seem that great to me and there was something about the pictures that annoyed me.Well when I finally saw finished objects from other knitters I was surprised to say the least. It wasn't the patterns that had turned me off, but the yarn/color selections and the pictures that had pushed me away.I finally got this book for my bday and I already have a few patterns lined up to knit. But be warned there are plenty of mistakes in the patterns. I'm not sure if the pattern writers were trying to over simplify or they write patterns in a totally different manner than other books, but whatever the reason it leads to confusion and mistakes amongst knitters."
2,amateurish,"I found that this book has lots of cute projects, but when I tried to knit one (baby booties) the pattern was wrong -- a disappointment considering I had already purchased the yarn!! There is little point in owning a knitting book with unusable patterns."
4,"A nice follow-up to ""Stitch 'n Bitch""","The patterns in this book are really interesting. They range from everything to cabled belts to baby booties to light sweaters. This isn't as informative as the original ""Stitch 'n Bitch"" book, but if you have mastered the basics, it is a good starting point for ideas. Plus, it has tried and true tips and tricks from knitters accross the nation."
3,Ehhh.,"This book definitely has better patterns than the first one, but they are still pretty basic. It's a fun book to read, but I think I was expecting too much pattern-wise. I'll whip up a few of the tops in the Sexy Summer Knits section and I want to make the furry bear cap in pink & white next winter. This book is still a pretty good deal since you can buy it for cheap on Amazon right now. I just bought the author's Happy Hooker crochet book too and I like it better."
3,"Definitely some fun stuff, but lots of filler","I like this book MUCH better than the original Stitch n Bitch. SnB Nation has some cute patterns and decent explanations for the novice knitter. The only drawback is the tons of filler patterns in the book and not enough meat to sink your teeth in to. Many of the patterns are very 90s hipster, but it's not too hard to make them your own and update them in to this century. I'd recommend seeing the book in person first, before ordering it blindly."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,Parts of this book are really great but most of the patterns are not for anyone over age 20!!!
4,Good Review,"Excellent photographic journey of 20th century style -- not only clothing, but hair and make-up as well. Very similar to COUTURE: THE GREAT DESIGNERS by Caroline Milbank and includes many of the same photos and drawings. FASHION is about 200 pages longer than COUTURE, however, and therefore includes more information, plus is somewhat less costly. If you already have COUTURE, you already have FASHION -- no need to buy both unless it's an area of detailed research."
5,Fabulous for Students,"This book is fantastic simply for the amount of information it contains, both about designers and info about the particular decade of fashion. Just buy it, especially if u r a student on a limited budget."
4,Kate's Turn,"I, while not anywhere near Kate's level, take dancing lessons and have for seven or so years. I don't know much about probessional dance, but I know how hard it can be and how much pressure one can feel. When Kate moves to New York, she experiences the stress of not being able to eat when she's hungry and the fear of not having a dancer's body. She dances in the Nutcracker, but she's still not happy. So she makes a big choice.I, for the most part, thought the book was well written and had good characters. But I couldn't really see a clear plot line. Also, I was dissapointed by the decision Kate made. She made it too quickly and on a whim. All in all, this book was a cute, quick read."
1,Fire Hazzard,"Beware - these bulbs, which appear to be part of a PGE GIVEAWAY that are being sold retail burst into flames or simply smoldered when shortly after I installed themI would never buy them again and destroyed them after the second incident.Oh and they performed lousy as dimmable bulbs in every fixture in which I installed them (I bought a dozen).But that's just my experience."
3,May not fit without mods,"This was listed as the correct hood strut for my e28 BMW (5-series).While it is mostly correct, the mounting holes on both ends are considerably too small for the BMW mount points. I needed to drill them out to make them fit.I paid about 5 bucks a piece on Amazon so did not mind a few minutes extra work. For some reason, they are now more that 3x what I paid. Worth the extra effort if you find them cheap. Unless you are getting a great deal, you may as well stick with something that fits out of the box."
5,The Edge,"This is the most inspirational book I've ever read. A must read for anyone who wants to be succesful in anything, whether it be sports or life."
5,scorched earth zep rock,With the honourable exception of the Ig's Raw Power this is easily the best rock album of all time (I kid you not).Shamefully ignored by both fans and critics(though not by musicians)this album not only features drumming Kieth Moon would be proud of-and bonzo could only dream of-but some of the most ferocious guitar and powerful lyrics ever commited to plastic.Frankly it makes Zeppelin sound like ledden fingered bores.Buy this album it might just change you life-though not nessacerily for the better!
4,"Oh, what might have been!","The 5's last album (if you disregard the plethora of latter-day compilations and concert recordings), High Time leaves you wishing the band had stayed together instead of going out in a blaze of vinyl glory. This is a remarkable album by a remarkable band. What's even more remarkable is that ""Over and Over"" alone, is worth the price of the album; this is surely one of rock's masterpieces (and an all-but-forgotten one), a battle cry for a generation, in the vein of The Who's Won't Get Fooled Again. Yeah, it's that good."
4,MC 5 - 'High Time' (Rhino/WEA),"Originally released in 1971, as this was the band's third and final proper/actual/legit/all new material ...call it what you like(not counting compilations)record.Not as earth-shattering as the 'Kick Out The Jams' lp,but still very decent. I felt 'High Time' gave most MC 5 fans what they had come for. Most of these cuts here have resurfaced upon numerous compilations and live archive CD's.Tracks that did it for me were ""Sister Anne"",the wailing ""Miss X"",the Rob Tyner penned ""Future/Now"" and ""Skunk(Sonicly Speaking)"". Good old school Detroit rock&roll."
1,Totally Useless,"These are straight pieces of precut line that will not work in my machine. Most of the precut line I've seen are ""U"" shaped. That's what I thought I was buying. This was a waste of money. I'm glad I only bought one pack of them. A better description from the seller would have prevented me from wasting my money."
2,Light duty only,"If you are trimming nothing but normal grass, this works fine. If you encounter tougher weeds, go back to your old string."
4,Easy replacement,"String trimmers all cut pretty much the same. For me, it comes down to line replacement. It's quick and easy. The line itself is durable and cuts well."
2,Brittle,"Though a good idea, I found the the repleacement lines to be brittle and last no longer than traditional string. They are convenient considering I have to change them constantly."
1,overpriced,"At $2.98 for one package, this is a ripoff. I just purchased this same product for $1.49 at my local supermarket, which by the way is not a discount store."
3,exciting historical fiction with some romance mixed in,"This particular book does not really fit into a specific genre. It contains many of the elements of a romance, and yet, the adventure and in-depth historical background makes into historical fiction. I hope to see more books by Ms. Kyle in the future."
5,A dangerous Devotion,This is a excellent read. Fast and extremely interesting. This is the firs book in a long time that I did not want to put down. The author is very detailed in her descriptions.
2,Insufficient lighting,"The flexible arm is too short to extend beyond your 12v plug and the lighting is not bright enough to cast sufficient light to read a map unless you place the map directly underneath the light within a few inches. However, the light does provide a nice orange glow and the price is very inexpensive."
