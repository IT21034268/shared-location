4,"Excellent, we use everyday.","Both husband with his Ipod, and me with his old ipod, listen to music at the kitchen table everyday now. Good sound out of the small speakers."
4,Wow !!!!,"I received these speakers as a present, then found them on Amazon. They are teriffic speakers! Especially for the LOW price. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't charge my ipod mini while playing. Unbelievable quality!"
3,not that loud,These are ok for someone listening by themselves in a small room. They do not produce that loud or high quality of sounds.
3,Portable Speakers,My wifes DVD player does not have a USB port... therefore she is not able to attach the speakers unless we can find an adapter somewhere. I wish we had known about this ahead of time or an adapter had been supplied with the speakers.
1,A cheap piece of plastic crap,"The sound quality is horrible, and the DC port broke within 30 seconds of use. The music straight from my phone is better than the tinny scratchy noise this thing makes."
4,Cheap and just what I needed,"I like how it is so compact and easy to carry around. The sound is ok, it would be the best one you can get at this price. I already have an outlet plug to plug on the wall so this doesn't seem to be a problem for me. I like it. Only con I can say is that the USB wire that came with it is too short. It has to be placed near an outlet. If the wire would be a problem for you, go buy an extra wire that is longer, but it works fine with the one it came with."
1,disappointing,This arrived yesterday. It worked for a few minutes until the charge was gone. Then it would only work if it's plugged into my computer. It must not be holding a charge because I let it recharge for hours on my computer. But as soon as I unplug it from my computer it died. I really liked the look of it.
2,Sound quality not great for podcasts,"Love the size but sound quality is not good. The louder the volume, the sound gets muffled. I listen to podcasts, and sometimes you cannot even understand what's being said!"
4,Great for the price,Pros:- Good battery life- compact- good soundCons:- not very loud- very short cord
5,Awesome!,These little things are pretty cool. Really loud for as small as they are. Not the best sound once they are at full volume but good for a little river trip or a cool picnic!
1,Horrible,This has got to be the worst speaker system ever made. I think mine worked for about 2 weeks before it died. What a piece of junk. Don't waste your money.
2,not really worth it.,"the sound quality is HORRIBLE. barely hear words, and it goes in and out. works okay when volume is VERY low. dont think its worth the shipping."
4,MORE THAN WHAT YOU PAID FOR,"This are very good little speakers you can take everywhere with you. Its perfect small gatherings. Dont expect them to replace your speakers or use it as a sound system. I havent found that much difference between this babies and those overpriced Apple devices. At this price, its beyond a bargain.You wont be dissapointed."
5,Very nice speakers,I bought these little speakers mainly to play at Work in the Office and I must say that I am amazed.....The sound is good and I am very happy with them.
3,"price is right, but they're not that portable","They're cheap for sure, and will be great for when I travel with my laptop. These speakers, unlike some I've owned, do need a power source. I was hoping they wouldn't. They came with a usb cable so you can plug it into your computer for power. That works like a charm. It also has a removable panel where you can put 4 AAA batteries. That doesn't work. I put in 4 batteries, clicked it on, and nothing happened. I've searched for some switch that would help it transition from AC to DC power but I couldn't find one. So, they're light and the price is right, but they don't port without some way of plugging them in. The sound is tin canny, but not too bad. It's like you took the external speaker on the ipod touch and turned up the volume."
1,Not very good quality......,"Not much volume without them starting to vibrate. I was pretty dissapointed in the fact that it does nt allow you to turn the volume up very loud without them vibrating and they sound very tinny, you would be better off 2 pay $20 for a pair of computer speakers that hook up to an ipod or mp3 player. You will get much better sound and you will get more volume."
3,Really surprised,When I bought this I didn't think that has a very high sound .................. for this reason it surprised me .......... but for listen the music with friends in very little places it works very good.........
2,Not loud at all,I have the Ipod Touch second generation which has external speakers. They're not very loud at all which is why I bought these speakers. But these portable speakers weren't any louder than my external ones. So it was a waste for me to buy them.
3,You get what you pay for,"I only paid $4 plus shipping for a total of $11, so I wasn't expecting much and got about that. The sound is fairly poor and it doesn't even come with an A/C adaptor, which if i didn't already have a spare sitting around would have cost me more to buy than this product. Even so, I'm sure I'll get my $11 of use out of it at some point..."
2,note- no adaptor,A Good choice if you must have a small portable speaker to travel with but note that the small speakers work with batteries ONLY and do not have an AC adaptor.
1,These speakers are tricky.,"I originally thought these didn't work. But upon reading some more reviews about it, I have figured out the problem. You have to get the batteries in just right to get them to work. I had to re-insert them like 500 times, then press on them exactly right to get them to work. They work great when plugged into the laptop or any device that does not use the batteries, but the whole reason why I bought these speakers was to have PORTABLE speakers to take to the pool or beach, NOT to plug them into the wall (I have my expensive bose speakers for that...). SO all in all, they work ok, just jiggle the batteries a lot and try not to move the unit. I am still very disapointed."
1,Boby Vinton Polkas,"I was not very happy with Bobby Vinton singing polkas.His style is, Roses are Red, songs. In another words love songs."
3,Works good,"Pretty good - have not used it with an SD card yet. It records good too, just make sure it is stationary. Not a stellar review because it is not a stellar peice, but it is functional and works for what I got it for."
3,Not to user friendly,"I gave this to my brother for Christmas it is quite a nice looking mp3 player, however it feels kind of cheap and is not to user friendly. I have used much better. Another thing is you will put mp3's on it and it will only put the ones it wants to put, when u redo it then some of the previous songs you had will remove by themselves but when you go to the delete mode on the mp3 all the songs are there but wont show up in the play file. I also hate the fact that you have to buy batteries for it, the first day my brother used it the batteries were used up so either he buys a battery per day or he gets rechargeable batteries.I like the head phones though much better than the ipod head phones. You hear the song loud and crisp thats the best thing about this mp3 player the head phones."
3,Could have been better,"My impressions about the book:Positive :-The comprehensive listing of 10 factors or ""faces"" since innovation is about ""People creating value through the implementation of new ideas.""-Plenty of examples/cases-Color pictures for illustration of cases-Once chapter per ""face""Negative:-Case studies discussed are superficial in analysis-Some case studies are ""force fits""-No concrete measure to keep the ""devil's advocates"" at bay- Only a passive approach of listing past successes.Powerful topic - Weak presentation.Scope for innovation !!Could have been better. Perhaps my expectations are high since this book comes directly from an insider at IDEO. Had it been written by someone else, I would have rated it 5 stars."
4,Stretching Your Creativity Characteristics,"IDEO has done it again. And this time the workings of a creative organisation, with a mix of diversed individuals of different creative characteristics. In this book, Thomas Kelley has exemplified many scenarios that require the RIGHT MIX within a team in driving creativity within any organisation. He weighs in each individual's charateristic strengths and weaknesses, and from these, formulate the BEST FORMULA in which the RIGHT TEAM of members can contribute and work creatively, harmonously, as well as productively.Isn't it time for your organisation to 'stretch' your creativity characteristics of everyone involved? This book will teach you how to achieve that!"
4,Good book for already initiated,This Book is good for people who already have initiated his knowledge on Innovation. Not an ideal book for initiaters.
2,Meh...,"I have had personal interactions with designers from IDEO and when I found this book which describes their design process, I was extremely curious. It is a good book describing how IDEO performs their special magic, but the narrative tended to drag on and it is one of those books that remains unfinished on my bookshelf."
5,A VERY FUN learning toy.,"My 6 year old received this for his birthday. A wonderful way to learn math in a fun, exciting activity! He loves it, and his 4 year old brother has been learning his math too. Because you can do addition, subtration, division or multiplication, this game should last for years! The kids have fun with it over and over again. Money VERY well spent! I will be getting it for other kids!"
5,You can count on this epoxy,"We use this glue in very delicate medical equipment, but my best experience with this epoxy was with a car rear mirror that kept on falling after using the ""special"" glues recommended for this particular case. I used the Devcon epoxy and the mirror never fell again, but you can use it for many other things. Follow the instructions, it works very well..."
5,Excellent book!,"This book reveals with easy words and graphics how the campaign against Saipan e Tinian happens and gave a good idea of how fierce was the fight for the islands, it's a good reference for studies of second world war."
4,helped with family history,"My uncle, Herbert Shaw, was killed on Saipan. He was awarded the Silver Star for his heroism, and the Purple Heart. This book helped me to know more about the campaign in which he died."
2,Average video - poor soundtrack,"This video certainly shows off some big waves, but the soundtrack is awful and the overall quality is not that good. Many of the waves were pulled from the video 'Laird' and the video quality is much much better in that video. In this video, some of the same rides are shown twice or even 3 times. Maybe they think we wouldn't notice. The quality of the background music is awful. I like punk music, but this stuff sounds like a circular saw going through a metal trashcan, for 35 minutes.Anyway, some of the footage is awesome so it might be a nice collection to your library, just press mute and play your own music from your stereo while you're watching it."
1,Big Wednesday is a Big Disappointment,"I bought this DVD last week and i'm not happy to announce that the quality is terrible, it looks like it was shot on 16mm, its blurry, poor resolution and half the film is shots of guys talking. Big Wednesday is a Big Disappointment and i don't recomend buying this DVD. The PBS special on nova was much better."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,First it took so long to put together (that may be my fault) and then the air goes down while in the sun. My granddaughter loved it she is 2.....
2,short lived,when draining the pool and at the last of the water I tried to turn the pool over to clean it and a split happened in the seem. My kids loved playing in it but it was short lived.
2,Nice and easy!,This is a great cookbook with easy recopies that everyone in my family will eat. It is rare to find a cookbook where every recipe you make is a winner but this book is the one.
5,Awesome!,"The recipes in this cookbook are fabulous! I bought this book a few weeks ago and so far have made the: Basic Chicken and Dumplings, Spicy Beef Enchilada casserole, Super Stroganoff, Classic Hungarian Goulash, Pork Chops in Mustard Sauce, Lamb-Vegetable casserole, Rotini & fresh basil with pinenuts & cheese casserole. Everything blended well and was easy to make. I prepared a lot of these dishes in the morning then baked them at night. I highly recommend this book. So tasty!"
5,Buy it for the TURKEY (or chicken) TETRAZZINE recipe!,"I have to admit that this book isn't exactly the type of ""casserole"" book I thought it would be either (as another reviewer stated regarding the non-use of canned soups etc) but I am still quite happy with it. The Turkey (or Chicken) Tetrazzine recipe is so creamy and delicious that I recommend buying it for that recipe alone! I have only tried one other recipe from the book so far and that was ""Seafood Lasagna"". It was sort of expensive to make and My Husband liked it and I did not. I thought it tasted too fishy BUT,I used canned crab meat instead of fresh and that could have been the reason for that. After scanning the rest of the recipes and ingred. lists, I do look forward to trying some of the other recipes in the book very soon."
2,Some good Some bad,"I was happy to see the same type of review that I am writing.. some good, some bad. And actually, I have not yet found the good one yet but there just has to be one. I tried the mac and cheese and threw the entire casserole away. I am a good cook and even in reading it, I doubted it but wanted to follow the recipe to check and it did not fail me, it was just awful. Not enough moisture, no bubbling at all. This is one of 3 casseroles I have made this winter and well, I think that I will put this cookbook back on the shelf. Too bad, the recipes sound good atleast!!"
5,Great for a busy mom,"This is my go to cookbook for fast and easy meals. My favorite recipe is the roasted chicken with vegetables and I make it OFTEN! The nice thing is you can alter the recipes to suit your needs. Simple and easy to find ingredients, definitely a favorite for a busy mom."
3,Not Totally Satisfying,"I found the recipes in this cookbook average and not inspiring. There is no recipe in here, of the ones I've tried, that I felt inclined to make a second time or pass on to a friend. On the other hand, unlike some other reviewers, I can't say that I found bad recipes in here. Just nothing inspiring."
4,Mostly Hits,"What is tough about this is that it seems The Far Side has always been there. That being said, it doesn't feel quite as fresh as it once did. Most of these cartoons I have read 1000 times. In the end, though, you can't go wrong with Gary Larson."
3,funny!!,this book is funny aand so is the rest of the farside collection. i started collecting farside books because of this first one
3,Insight into the Past,"Blom's alternative history makes fascinating reading. We know that many of the great events of the past were the result of little things. the ""What if"" of history makes great reading and stirrs the imagination. However, while much was made of the Spanish's facial hair, the story of Hummingbird who becomes Pizarro's ""boytoy"" is unrealistic. Certainly, Hummingbird would have been revolted by the rest of Pizarro's body hair and by the smell of his unwashed body. Much is said about the Spanish clothing with its many layers, but the result of wearing all of those clothes, is a not too pleasant aroma."
4,"Fireman Sam is entertaining, educational.","My son really likes Fireman Sam. The show is computer animated, keeps his attention, and also provides facts and information that a toddler-early elementary children can understand. This recent video is 45 minutes and is well worth it for the 10 dollars + dollars Amazon is offering right now. This recent one is all about fire safety and goes through the many different kinds of fires providing information and safety tips. It can also make a great rental from Netflix, or a check-out at your local library."
2,"not the ""classic"" Fireman Sam","My son was very disappointed with this dvd. He said, I want to watch the ""plain"" Fireman Sam....This is the new computer animated version, more action, a bit more drama, but still ok, for little kids..We will stick with the ""plain"" versions!:)"
1,sometimes older versions ought to be stayed with,"the older version using claymation design is better espically as it shows dimensions and is understood by really young children not just the cartoon crazed older ones. I was very dissapointed and whoever decide to change the format wether it be for money saving purposes or design was wrong they will loose more money using this so called new version. I doubt I will buy any of the new version ones using animation I loved the claymation type and I hope they continue to use that for wallace and gromit and shawn the sheep cartoons, my children and entire family loves those type more."
4,"""Madbomb"" is Captain America by Jack Kirby, Vol. 1","This book contains Captain America & The Falcon #193 (1976) - #200 (1976). This book begins Jack Kirby's mid 70's run on CA, with the ""Bicentennial Battles"" book being Vol.2This volume contains Jack Kirby's pencils for each cover as well as the finished cover art for each book."
5,Kirby's 70's work from Marvel still stands the test of time,From DC and back to Marvel again. I wish Kirby had stayed on Captain America from the time he began in 1975. It was one year prior to his super size Bicentennial Battles Treasury Edition comic. It was a run I'll never forget and this is the story that started it all. For those of you don't know who this artist is check this book out. Though the stories can be heavy handed they do tell a lot about the artist and his point of view. I only wish younger readers of todays Marvel comics would rediscover what an important influence Kirby was to Marvel Comics because without him there would be no Marvel!
1,Wow.... This is incredibly terible!!!,"In short terms... if i could give no stars, I would! They have this washed up never been wrestler in every match who sucks worse than sluts with STDs. And the electrified cage match is incredibley fake, and so is every other match. They even added sound effects for when peopel get punched, or fall. The only good part is the have this realy hot busty blonde, but it aint worth it just for her. All I can say is DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS YOU LIKE GETTING RIPPED OFF, PERIOD!!!"
1,Not what you think it is,"I bought this DVD from a store, so I was able to look at the box first. The box leads you to believe it is an ECW or FMW style DVD. But it looks like an Indy Greenhorn promoter with a few bucks used the name of Terry Funk to push what should otherwise be a $5 DVD. There are added sound effects and almost no recognizable talent on it."
2,NOT WORTH IT.....,THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 2-4 SONGS WORTH HAVING ON THIS CD---NOT WORTH IT! I DOWNLOADED IT SO THERE WAS NO GOING BACK ONCE I BOUGHT IT.
1,Never Received!,"Never received...emailed seller...they said they sent...never received...wont answer follow up emails. Will NEVER purchase from this seller again. Amazon is great...some of their ""sellers""...not so great!"
4,Review of Taste of a Man,The writing style is excellent - good descriptions and transitions. But the content is gory. I cannot force myself to finish reading the book because the images created in my mind make me too revolted to read the ending. YUK!!!
2,I just couldn't get into it,"I'll admit first of all I only got into a little over 50 pages of the book, but I couldn't go much farther than that, I was bored to death (no pun intended.) I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over about the main character's obsession with Jose. There wasn't much I found likable about the main character either, I'm not sure if the reader is supposed to even like her. Within the first chapter everything is explained so I also felt that ruined the rest of the story and I didn't feel any desire to finish the book because I already knew how it ended."
2,Drivel,"Having been a student of the former Yugoslavia, I have read all of Drakulic's essays on life in Yugoslavia, which was different from life in other Communist countries. Yugoslavia was a special case, and Drakulic had special things to say. She is a keenly perceptive and accessible writer with a gift for giving detail and lending insight into things people from outside Yugoslavia could not understand. However, Drakulic is not a fiction writer. This book is an improvement from her effort in Marble Skin, but I find that her fiction is pretentious-trying-not-to-be-pretentious, far-fetched (and these are not supposed to be fantasy or sci-fi novels), and completely devoid of anything really original. Drakulic goes for shock value, but her choices are obvious and not at all engaging.Don't waste your time."
5,the very best blues CD I've heard,"When my dad gave this to me as an early Christmas present, I couldn't stop playing it. It's my very favorite CD, awesome, awesome. I'm using it to learn how to play guitar, and I've just formed a rock band because of these songs and this music. We open our school shows now with Midnight Special, and I can't wait to see these dudes on TV. Tbyrd, Art, Nokie, rock on, thanks for making this music, I hope to meet you and see you on stage as soon as I can."
5,Love this book,"This book covers a lot more stories than most activity books. There are 52 puzzles for 52 different bible stories, plus 52 puzzles for different memory verses. This book includes a wide variety of puzzles, and the pages look professional. I love this book and use it all the time for teaching middle schoolers."
4,Good Old Bluegrass Music,"This album is one of the best compilations around. It includes rockin' instrumentals (like Devil's Dream), sweet mournfull singing (like Mother Maybelle), and some talkin blues (Me And Ol' Merle). It includes some standards and some originals. A very diverse compilation. Great liner notes."
4,Fresh recording of a rarely recorded opera,"This was my first IDA recording and I wasn't disappointed. The music is adequate, if a little less crisp than most professional modern G&S recordings. I don't find the singing in this performance to be significantly below the level of most of that of the Reed-era 1960's D'Oyly Carte, at least as preserved on CD.What makes this Ida stand out particuarly for me is the dialogue; usually I prefer my G&S CD's music-only; CD's are good for music, and I'm inclined to want to skip dialogue tracks. But this Ida is almost enough to make me change my position; the dialogue is delivered in an actual lively way; it's not the Reverand-Lovejoy-style glacial incantation that we so often find in Gilbert & Sullivan. These are people with decent acting skills, reading G&S dialogue as if it's a modern theatrical production. Amazing idea."
1,Not true to size!,"This item is not true to size. Acording to the picture, the item looks like it should hang slightly away from the body. I am a size 18 and ordered the item a little big at a 2x which should have fit according to their size chart. The top is skin tight and shorter than the picture. The thong is definantly not 2x, I could barely get them on.Additionally, the material is quite scratchy and cheap feeling.This purchase was not worth the money. I will be seeking a refund."
2,Won't stretch that far.,I am a true size 22/24 so I ordered a 3x. The top fit OK but the thong was a no go. Iit was barely a large.
5,Actually fits a plus sized woman.,"This item actually does fit a plus-sized woman and it looks attractive! Seller sent the wrong color, but I like it anyway. I can confirm that 2x size fits a size 18. It's basically a piece of stretch lace with a fringe and some pretty nice detail work. It looks nice and it feels soft and comfortable. I like it a lot. If they get more in stock in the color I originally ordered, I will order another one. :)I agree with the other reviewer - the thong is a joke."
2,Better for Baby-Boomers and Older,"I am a movie fanatic, but I am only 22 years old. The game was purchased by family who thought it was a perfect match, and I was excited too...until I started playing it. No one knew the answers to any of the questions. Nearly all of the questions dealt with movies and people that were big long before I was born, so I would recommend only the most hard-core film buffs (as in UCLA Graduate film history student) or those over the age of 40 should purchase this game. Even though it seems like it could be a very fun game, it hasn't left my shelf since last Christmas and has been collecting a very impressive collection of dust."
2,I'am Not Impressed,"Don't waist your time with this DVD. It starts out like it is going to be a good show you see some nudity,(mostly brests).Then the car show has some real nice automobile's with a few female models,Possing by them. The real borring part is that there are two cars racing on a track for about fourty five minutes of this DVD and once in a while they will show a quick picture of a model that is fully clothed in between the race.The women look nice,But there is very little action. A strip tease video would entertain you more then this DVD."
5,My favorite cat calendar,"My husband always buys me a cat calendar for home and work each year for Christmas. I have received several, but 365 Cats Page a Day is by far my favorite!"
3,Adequately written tale of a marvelous band,"I'm a quintessential fan of the weez, and I am enjoying this book, but I don't think this is well-written rock writing. Luerssen is pedantic and amateurish. He researches reviews well, but misses a lot of the big stories and cops out of the big questions. This is far from the definitive book on this great band, but it'll do for now.He nails some of the story about Rivers time(s) at Harvard, but sputters out when it comes to Cropper's and Welsh's exits. Most of the time he is casually and ineffectually dropping song titles. He suffers from moiety of sources. Karl, the weez's best documentarian, is only present in fleeting moments.We'll have to wait for a better book to learn the unadulterated truth about the band. Still, this is a good whetter of my appetite"
2,"Informative, but poorly written and often boring...","This entire book reads like an 8th-Grade Research paper. From an uncountable amount of grammatical and spelling errors to numerous repeated sentences (literally quotes retyped word for word, pages apart), it's difficult not to get irritated while reading this. The information on Weezer is great, but often times the author veers away from focusing on the band and gives too much information on things that even the most obsessed fan won't care about. Unfortunately, this appears to be the only book on Weezer out right now, so if you want to learn more about the band in book form this is all you've got. I suggest just browsing around their official website, because it's obvious that's where the author got quite a bit of his information. Don't waste your money."
3,More a patchwork than a real bio,"When I first heard of a Weezer biography, I was really stoked, 'cause clearly there is a lot of interesting stuff to be told about that band. But I was a bit deceived by that biography. It's kind of poorly written, with grammar mistakes and word repetitions at a couple of places. The information contained in the book is accurate and complete, but the author's way of writing is not fluent at all, which makes the reading a little less enjoyable. Hardcore Weezer fans should read it though, because there is a lot of information in there, but it's mostly about Rivers Cuomo's behaviour with the others. The book could have been called ""Rivers'trial"". It's more a patchwork of quotes than a real biography, in the end, but there is some very funny and interesting parts. Only for diehard fans."
5,Essential tool for Novell Networks,"A concise, well ordered handbook for Novell Intranetware. This book has saved me hours of searching through the various Novell product manuals. Well written and indexed it gets to the heart of the complex subject with clear explanations in a well laid out, portable format."
5,This is a fantastic book!,"If you teach children to read and are looking for ways to construct a meaningful language arts program, you need to read this book. Phonics That Work! is very user-friendly and full of practical ideas. Janiel Wagstaff does a great job! I truly enjoyed reading this book. It has changed the way I teach."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I'm always looking for phonics books to read in order to improve my teaching methods. Well, this is an old book. It was published in 1999. If you have graduated within the past 5-7 years, you learned all of her suggestions in school. As a former reading specialist, I was shocked to discover that it focused on using a new method to teach phonics...onset and rimes. This was new in 1999? I guess so. It also incorporates a 'whole language' focus. Any current reading teacher knows that a comprehensive, balanced literacy program is needed in the classroom...not just whole language.If you are currently teaching in a primary classroom, do not spend your hard earned money on this old book. You already know how to teach onset and rimes."
5,Works well and it's a good value.,For $2.68 it's a great deal. The tape works well at keeping boxes closed. I've used it to tape packages in the freezer and it stays taped there too.
5,A Must Have,This is an excellant DVD. Both the sound track and the Wake boarding are incredible. I can't stop watching this one!
3,Not what you Expect,"When I got this book in the mail I was a little disappointed. It is a very tiny book. Maybe it's more my fault for not reading the description more thoroughly.The book does have some decent information in it on self-publishing. If you don't own any books about self-publishing, the this book may be of some help to you. If however, you have read other books on the subject this book won't add any new information. Practically everything included you can find in another book that also includes much more advice.Try just about any book from Dan Poynter."
4,Concise and pithy,"Anyone interested in self-publishing a book can learn a lot from Ingrid M.E. Hicks' Publish it Yourself! The ""ABCs"". Within these 68 pages is everything you need to know to self-publish a book. Hicks has managed a coup by having her forward written by Dan Poynter, the guru of the self-publishing business.If the how-to books have you feeling overwhelmed and slightly nauseous about venturing into this field, Hicks makes the process seem relatively painless. That's the beauty of this little book. It tells you what you need to know, then lets you research each step. Each chapter gives tips and how-tos that range from completing the manuscript to building a publishing company to printing, promotion and, that goal of all writers, book sales.This book is basic, to the point and does not have any superfluous information...it's all captured for you. All you need to do now is finish your manuscript, buy a copy of Publish it Yourself! The ""ABCs"" and get ready for the ride!"
4,Great deck,"Another good deck for beginners. The fellowship lacks chemistry. You may wanna take Gimli or Legolas or Boromir, but in the end you'll realize you have to rebuild the starting fellowship An idea. Keep Gandalf and Boromir and try to get some hobbits cards.But the best thing about this deck are the shadow cards. Goblins from Moria are amazing. You may wanna add some cards or change some details, but if you don't, it doesn't matter. You'll be able to destroy your opponent with a swarm of Goblins anyway."
4,"I am ""newcomer""",I like this Game and the Philosophy of GO. For this reason I've read this book with great interest and very slowly. Some times returning for previous chapters.To my mind examples (exercises) are very useful for homework.
3,Starting Go Players,"This book contains a wealth of information for the Go player that's just beginning to play. It doesn't pull its punches but it also doesn't go into great depth on a lot of the concepts. There is a reason that most Go books come in series' of 5-6 books, there's just a lot to talk about.If you're looking to start grab this book or just find a club in your area. There is a certain use for literature at the beginner level but playing one game a week with a shodan would take you much further than this book could ever hope."
2,Disappointment. Not worth the money.,"____________BOTTOM LINE: Don't buy this ""book"".This is a very cheaply made pamphlet (see note below) with three CDs of not-that-good singing. The only valid musical idea contained herein is - learn intervals. To sing harmony you must know your intervals. Specifically 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths. That is covered in one page (page 3) in the ""book"", and 1 track (track 5, cd 1) in the 3 CDs.NOTE: The quality of this ""book"" is very similar to that of a 3rd grade student's book report, bound for $.35 with a plastic comb at ... copy center."
4,found this very useful....,"....for my doctoral research, which involves the history of California. The editors made a conscious choice to show this history in less Eurocentric form; Native Californian voices and perspectives are taken seriously, and there is good ethnographic and naturalistic information to be had.While I'm not an expert in this area, I do question whether the persistent use of terms like ""aristocracy,"" ""hierarchy,"" ""wealth,"" ""headman,"" and ""chief"" are appropriate when discussing Native Californians. My impression is that our Western and European prejudices are still at work here."
3,"Tedious, but ...","Contested Eden is a book filled with information, it is too bad that it comes off so much like a textbook. The stories can be good, yet can also be tedious. It is very helpful in the study of California History, yet can put one to sleep at the same time. I recommend it, but with caution."
5,Scholarly essays about pre-gold rush California,"This book looks at pre-gold rush California from varorious angles. Essays on native California history, along with indigenous actions during early occupation years are major parts of this text. The history of ""Californio"" women and indigenous sexuality are also included. Californio and Anglo interactions between 1820 and 1850 cover new ground.At times the work appears a bit ""heady"" because the advanced vocabulary. However, this is a ""must read"" for any California scholar."
1,They tried real hard,"This little video was stunningly animated, and the score was well done. The producers tried real hard to make it hip and fresh. But it was a very poor film. The Bible story wasn't just watered down it was butchered. The roaches and a conscientious lion had more to do with saving Daniel than the angel. While I really enjoy Toby Mac and Nicole C. Mullen, the songs they performed were contrived and out of place in the story, as well as worthless outside of it. I found it on sale for $3. It was neither worth a penny, nor the space it takes on a shelf."
4,Another gift.,Yes my husband liked it. I wish you would quit asking me to say more...... five more words...la la la
5,Exile - The Complete Collection,"Live shows ate great, but this is the next best thing! It was simple to order and I received it within the time frame requested. Amazon is my favorite on-line shopping place!"
4,Good Theory book,I really enjoyed this book and would use it again to educate anyone that was interested in music. Good for the beginning music student and anyone who wanted to seriously study music.
1,Not A very Good Text,There are plenty of texts out there that do a better job and make more sense. I would stick to a more well known text.
4,Donkey Kong Rules!,Got this for my boy. Came in perfect condition and it came FAST! He is 12 and loves it!
5,It is Ok!,My son loves the game and the drums. This is a very good option to buy both thing with a very good price.
4,"A Review by ""Nixiecoolgirl""-So Cute!","Okay...This is clearly a very good MyScene doll. Wow! Nolee looks awesome! Her outfit really matches her sporty style and it matches my style, too. The colors are original compared to other MyScene dolls and the price is cheap! This doll is a total bargain at only $9.99 and I think almost all girls will find it a suitable toy.Rate my review!^^(..) Nixiecoolgirl"
3,an okay doll,this doll is okay and very pretty but her makeup is ugly and you would feel weird looking at her makeup. her skirt is really pretty but her shirt could be better! this doll is okay but she not all perfect! make a good desicion.ps:if you want my opnion i would suggest miami getaway chelsea or madison. bye
1,shuttup!,I worship bratz because they are hookers like me! I hate god soo bad because I have bratz! I love fairytaleprincess because she is a snob and a slutty hooker! I hate myscene because they are pretty. bratz are kewl because they are ugly and anorexic.[...]
5,REALY?????,I will never belvie you.You are just saying that because you hate my scene.NO!!!!!!NO!!!!!!!NO!!!!!!I hate people fights about dolls.I think Bratz and my scene rock.And oh yes!Shut up and go away if you hate my scene dolls.SHUT UP!!!!!!STOP FIGHTING!!!!!GO AWAY!!!!!!!!!THERE IS NOTHING IMPORTANT TO FIGHT ABOUT DOLLS.
1,"um, hello","Do you actually think you are fooling people. Duh, everyone can tell you are a crazy and lame My Scene fan pretending to be a Bratz fan saying you hate god. Where stop being a jerk because Fairytailprincess is not a slut or snob, you are. Because you like My Scene dolls. And stop being an idiot, Brazt fans don't hate god. I go to church with my 8 best friends who we all love god and Bratz dolls. So, shut up. And you are right, you are retarded because you like My Scene dolls. My Scene dolls are ugly, Bratz are beautiful."
1,Okay all you lameo's...,Bratz dress like teenagers you see today! While Myscene continues to copy Bratz! Therefore if you call a Bratz a slut then you're calling all teenagers slutz!
3,Live recording from 1970 with coughing in background,"The performances are very nice, very subtle, but it's a live recording and there is coughing in the background that I found annoying. I prefer chamber music recorded in a chamber-sized space (not a concert hall), and while I can put up with Glenn Gould's singing and Keith Jarrett's moaning in the background, I don't want to hear audience coughing. I wish one of the other reviewers mentioned it, but I didn't see it."
5,One of the finest and most striking books I have ever read,"Mrs. Hunter has written what I consider to be one of the most fascinating and absorbing books I have ever read. This in depth but readable depiction of North Korea brings us up close to a society that is quite foreign to most of us. The book, while imparting many political facts that were classified until recently, also provides a very human glimpse into the lives of people who live in this cult society. I would recomend the book not only to those specifically interested in North Korea, but also to anyone who enjoys reading at all."
3,A good addition to the Jujitsuan's library,This manual illustrates the series of ko & disruption points in the human body. Also covered are the trademark compression strikes.
3,For those who want the whole story,"This is late period Carl Smith. The music quality is outstanding. These are all original recordins. This complements ""The Essential"" perfectly. On the downside, cheap packaging and cheap notes. Not as bad a release as some want to make you think. All of these songs except 3 made Billboards country chart 1975-1978. This would be a very historical release if not for the budget line packaging. Not a greatest hits package, but definately ""The Best of"" his Hickory records era."
4,Great british thriller,Great movie with great acting. it gives your mind quite the fracking in the end. I love Cillian Murphy. This movie arrived on time and in good condition.
1,Retreat,I am not that happy with this movie it is another one that I wish I had rented it before I bought it.I will give it away.
1,Waste of Talent,I watched this movie because I think Cillian Murphy is the best actor of our time. I'm scratching my head wondering why he would choose this trash. A complete waste of his amazing talent.
3,Not bad,"I love Cillial Murphy and I have thouroughly enjoyed every film he has participated in but this film is one of the worst of his career. But, don't get me wrong it is not horrible either. If you are a fan of his work try 28 days later or Sunshine, 2 of his best."
2,bad movie,The movie was not what I thought it would be the ending was not a good ending at all and thought it would of been a better movie
2,Bloodied Uninvited Psychos Improve Your Marriage,"A young couple (Thandie Newton and Cillian Murphy) take a retreat to a remote island off the coast of England to rekindle the flame in their marriage. There is a deafening silence between them and allusions to a stillbirth in the air. All is going unswimmingly until an injured British soldier(Jamie Bell) washes up on their shore. When he comes out of his unconscious state he relates a tale of an epidemic racing through Britain. He heeds the couple to take the necessary precautions or face the consequences. Is he angel or devil? What do you think? An eight year old could have written a better script. This thriller is totally bereft of suspense. It telegraphs most of it's shocks(Look, Dear. I found a rifle.) rendering them meaningless. Completely wasted is a genuinely menacing turn by Bell. Just goes to show that the Brits can make formula garbage just like their American compatriots."
1,Waste of my life....,"With all due respect to those who liked this movie I have to say, that if it was possible to give it NO stars, that's what it would get from me. Stupid plot, slow moving....an absolutely depressing ending. I can find NO redeeming value in this pathetic film. And Thandie Newton needs to find a film where she can be the slightest bit positive and happy. She is quickly getting type cast as the sad, hysterical woman that she portrays here. This role was the same as every one I have seen her in...I only wish I could get the 88 minutes of my life back that I just wasted watching this piece of idiocy...."
5,Perfect watch for Urban Survival,"The watch is perfect! I wear it in a business casual work environment during the day. It keeps my bearings correct when I surface from the subway. On the weekends, it's ideal for roaming in the country side. The slim design and light weight make for a comfortable fit. I find the controls and settings to be very logical. The black faced titanium looks great. Thumbs up to the manufacturer."
1,Does the job of a casual hiking wrist-top computer but poor strap,"I owned several of these. The watch is works fine for hiking etc. The overall durability of the watch is decent but not rugged enough for intensive outdoor use, and within 1-2 years the strap breaks without any cause (the strap is mostly plastic pierced with holes on all versions- stainless steel or titanium). The durability of the strap is very poor and Suunto must know it since it is only under warranty for 1 year as opposed to 2 year warranty for the watch. Strap replacement by Suunto out of warranty is almost $100 so you'd better find a better strap after breaking the first time! I haven't found yet whether non-Suunto straps can be adjusted on it.The decision is yours whether it is worth the money..."
3,great watch - horrible band,"I'm on my second Observer. The first one had the wrist band fail after about two years and REI was pleasant enough to replace the watch for me. The second one had the leather band instead of the polymer band. I was hoping the leather would be more durable. No such luck. The leather band failed after one year of normal wear.However, the watch itself rocks. I wear it as a daily watch but I also use the altimeter function extensively (primarily for tracking vertical feet skied). It is perfect for my needs. I just wish they could make a band that lasted. Why don't they do a simple all metal band? The stainless band on my Tag has lasted 10 years....."
4,"Treny, hip and cool","This watch is a combination of many features that will prove useful for outdoor and Ski trips. You can use it also in town with a suit.If you buy it, choose the titanium version, it's worth the extra dollars as it is quite sleeker and lighter as well."
2,"Overpriced for quality, poor design","At first glance (over the web) this watch looks like the bees knees. But it doesn't have the quality feel I would expect for the price, especially the band. (mine is titanium)The other big problem I had is that you can't ""hack"" it to another timepiece. When you reset the seconds, it will tick from 00 to 01 seconds almost immediately, as the reset only zeroes the ""whole"" seconds, and not partial seconds.My $14.95 Coleman watch from Target functions as you would expect - when you reset to the top of the minute it is REALLY the top of the minute and 01 seconds comes exactly 1 second later.For someone who needs a precision timepiece, I think it crazy that a $500 watch has such a basic design flaw.I'll probably return it, I'm quite disappointed.Glenn"
3,"Great watch, terrible strap.","I've had this watch for four years and it's taken a real beating across the world. I've dropped it on tile, concrete, and asphalt from heights up to 10 feet and it still works fine. The only problem I've had it the strap, rather the clasp keeping the watch band closed. It's gotten to the point where a mere movement of my hand will spring it open leaving the watch dangling at an odd angle. I'm reluctant to shell out the $120 for a new band because all I need is a new clasp."
2,"All well and good, but it's 1/3 smaller in another way....","Just a brief note-The Observer is 1/3 smaller than the other Suunto watches, which is fine if you are a small person or have small arms/wrists. If you have a large wrist like my husband does(8"") the Observer WILL NOT FIT, at least the SS/SS and TI/TI versions.This was a major bummer Christmas Day!We returned the watch and that was the end of it..."
2,"Great Looks and Potential, But there's some buts...","This watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood', but I am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter - it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather.I was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible - certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve - and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch-prone. I cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for, even if the altimeter worked correctly."
2,Band is not Ti,Caveat emptor. The band is mostly resin with some Ti shards. Alarm is inaudible. Otherwise a good timepiece.
2,Expensive toy,"I love the design, weight etc, but what an expensive toy. The altimiter works sporadically, and often tells me I am 500' below sea level. I've read the directions many times but the watch seems to have a mind of it's own. The compass works well, but the barometer is also inaccurate.I wanted a turnkey watch, not something I needed to fiddle with every time I used it. Also, the clasp comes loose often, and if you need to get anything repaired, buy ticket to Finland..."
5,Great taste,slek and very cutiec just about goes with every thingas you can see the blue face just says buy me buy me buy me well thats about it I would give this watch two thumbs upppppp!!!!Ohh one more thing kidys this is a good gift for Daddy or Mommy
2,Poor Quality Control,"I got this charm from Pugster, and although it would have been beautiful if it had been properly soldered, it was soldered off-center and doesn't look very nice. I wrote a similar review on the Pugster site, and the review was pulled. Every other charm that I've gotten is really quite nice, and the overall idea of a non-dangling charm bracelet that doesn't get in the way of writing or typing is great. It's just a shame that somebody doesn't check on the individual charms as they're packed for shipping."
2,I'll watch it again.,"I agree that this is technically an excellent film. But it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind. Given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with Richard Widmark's character. His enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism. But in the end he doesn't just lose; he is literally thrown away as garbage.And then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take. All in all, I was left with the question, what is the point?The commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well. Its basicly a description of what you're watching, while you're watching it.I see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so I'll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie."
3,Over the top,"I love film noir and gritty crime drama, but consider this film so exaggerated and melodramatic that it becomes cartoonish - almost a parody of film noir. The music is overbearing and brass blares at every dramatically lit closeup, the camera tilted off center, every face bathed in sweat and contorted in fear or rage. It telegraphs emotion like a 1930s comic book, lacks any subtlety, and features hamfisted acting in virtually every scene. Widmark, in particular, sputters, squirms, and makes pop-eyed expressions which would embarass Daffy Duck. By the time of the epic wresting scene (featuring one plump actor who appears to be well into his sixties, the viewer will be laughing at the film's groteque absurdity or will have long since turned it off. Definitely see it if this is your thing, but don't buy it until you have."
4,a nice film noir movie,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the filmJules Dassin's ""Night and the City"" is the story of a swindler who attempts to make money through a wrestler but ends up getting a taste of his own medicine. The movie has some fine scenes of London and is very well written.The DVD has some fine special features which are as follows.Optional audio commentary by Glenn Erickson, Two interviews with director Jules Dassin,one new and the other from 1972, a comparison of the two film scores used for the Americna and British versions of the film, and a theatrical trailer.This is a great DVD to get."
2,Will wait for next generation,"Not having as much fun with mine. There are 3 things I was looking for in the unit:-photo viewer (connecting directly from camera)-movie downloads-internet accessI've been at it for 5 hours now, and still getting error messages when trying to view my photos loaded directly from the camera (this is not a recognized file type, will not play). I have a Nikon digital slr camera using JPEG formats.More error messages when trying to access e-mail (Yahoo and company server). There is not a backslash key on the keyboard which I need to get into my company email (through outlook web access).And lastly, it feels kind of clunkyI'm going to return it tomorrow, I just think it wasn't very user friendly."
3,Works well as a portable DVR,Im not sure how to use all of the features but the dock station works well. I record so many television shows wish I had the 160 gig
1,Over rated and not worth it!,Sucks in a word. All the features I wanted it for cost extra and you have to hook it up to a computer to get it to update. I wasted my money so you don't have too! Skip this one!
2,Okay but I prefer my iPad,"They gave these out in first class on my flight on American airlines Boston to san Francisco. It took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to turn the thing on and to operate the touchscreen (it's pressure based unlike the iPad). Overall the thing was a pain to use, pretty unintuitive, and I turned it off after about 10 minutes and went back to my iPad."
2,Not as advertised nor as easy to use as I expected.,I bought this item because i'm on the road often and thought it would be good to record and watch TV in hotels etc - sofar I have not been able to get it to work on any TV.... in both USA and Europe. [tried at least 7 different TVs]The wireless internet is very poor and the unit freezes often and just turns itself off - I have not been able to check my e - mail on any of my web based accounts as of yet.To play just about any type of video you have to purchase additional software from the website.I feel like I paid $500 for a big lemon.
3,Archos 704 pretty picture but . . .,"Pretty picture and a smooth Video Player but .. it's still a brick (weight) of a Portable Media Player.Archos 704 color screen is absolutely gorgeous, vivid color in all angle of views. Its touch-screen technology is flawless for a handheld with 7"" color screen. Interface takes some practice but as is with anything else- different. The truly shining feature has to be getting-the-DVD-into-the Archos 704. Simple and quick for you to get going on a train or plane or automobile. WiFi is somewhat slow but it's handy when you need to get to the email. Opera built in browser can be better, a lot better. Music as smooth with MP3 but unlike iPod where Apple owns the iTune. If you're a big fan of DVDs or have long commuting, this is it. It's the one."
1,It needs work,"I got the 704 in August and while I really only wanted it to view my photos I found that it was a locked system, even though it runs on Linux. You can't add any programs or other software to it. It is suppose to have Adobe Acorbat on it but I can't get it to open. I have not been able to download a complete movie yet, it always cuts out after an hour to an hour and a half.The biggest thing is when I contacted Archos Customer Support they told me that they would be no longer suppporting this model as it was hardware dependent and they would not be updating the firmware. The representative offered me a 15% discount totrade for a new 705.The inital impression of the unit is great, but after awhile you will see that this is just a poor imitation of the real thing.Don't buy the 704, wait for the 705 or wait for the 706!"
3,Customer Service IS NOT Archos,"When you call Archos 'Customer Service', you are getting a contracted call center. Their reps tend to answer calls for a variety of 'clients'. They also take calls for iPOD and MS Zune. The reps are given binders with VERY LIMITED information on any given product. That's why it's easier for them to just have you send the product back to them since they really don't have any staff 'experts'. If anyone sounds remotely like they know what they're doing; they're not Archos reps (there are none), these are just senior call center employees. SO you see they really don't have any PAID Archos technicians. The product is mass produced so the service provided is likewise."
5,More than a snowboard vid,"This video has all of the sickness of tricks mentioned in the other reviews, but it has more that was not mentioned. All snowboard videos have little in-between-parts videos, sometimes with mini-stories. But this vid takes the cake in that department, I was laughing so hard at some of the things they put in this movie, like the T-Bird, or the chainsaw shower scene. I don't want to go into any more detail for fear of ruining it for you. Basically, if you know enough about snowboarding to be looking at this, you should buy it."
1,Don't Bother,This DVD was a waste of money. The information was poorly presented and the DVD was not very well done. A couple of interviews with people from the area and lots of clips from Vampire movies but if you are looking for something new or interesting then you are out of luck. I thought that with Polanski involved it might be good but there is no redeeeming value to this DVD. Nothing new and very superficial and boring. I would put it on ebay for a dollar if it wasn''t that I would feel like I was cheating the buyer.
4,Great Historic Account of the REAL Dracula!,"If you want more than Bela's 1932 Dracula and others of this type, then here it is, the TRUE story about DRACULA, or Vlad Tepes as he was known in Hungry. Watch this film, then watch the old Dracula, and compare. Excellant Documentary film for sure!!"
4,Basic and thorough review - nothing fancy,"If you're curious how the whole genre got started, this does it. Quality of film work is PBS type/educational film type - not movie quality. Gives historical facts about death in the culture and era that seeded the vampire myths and not just about the historical figure that Dracula was based on. Think PBS informative and not movie entertainment."
4,My thoughts,A very informative documentary about the history of the Dracula legend. Includes many interesting facts about the real-life Romanian prince whom the famous character of Dracula was based on. A good watch!
2,"If I have to hear Mikey say, ""Fashion Week"" one more time I may implode.","This is reality? The entire season could have been presented in a one two-hour show...the repetition became really annoying, the characters were more shallow than a baby pool. I was relieved when the final episode was over, and kinda pissed with myself for watching all of them. My suggestion...pass on this altogether."
1,Terrible Show,"I accidentally purchased this video thinking it was the actual L Word. It certainly isn't. But I gave it a go, and it was terrible. No wonder it lasted only one season. I only made it through 3 episodes before I quit."
3,Doctor Who - Tomb of the Valdemar,"This is a hard to find gem of a novel. Written by S. Messingham, it deals with the fourth doctor (played on TV by the wonderful Tom Baker). It is a fast paced adventure that stays true to the spirit of the original series."
3,Alpha Hunter BU277,"This appears to be a BU277 which is advertised elsewhere as having a 12C27 MOD Sanvik steel blade. It is composed of .52% carbon, 14.55 chromium, .25% Phosphorous, .1-.2% silicon, .004 sulfur, 2.25% tungsten, and .5% vanadium......The 154cm steel is composed of 1.05% carbon, 14% chromium, .5% manganese, .4% molybdenum, NO PHOSPEROUS, .3% silicon, NO SULFUR, NO TUNGSTEN, and .5 vanadium. Therefore the 145cm should be harder, more carbon, and yet more flexible, 4% molybdenum, .3% silicon. Both should be have about the same rust resistance, as good stainless steel."
3,Disapointed but OK,"Received this knife as promised. At first glance, I liked the heft and it appeared very strong. Then I opened it and struggled to get it closed. The closing latch required 2 hands and forced me to place my fingers in front of the blade. ( I guess you could close it without putting your fingers in jeopardy, but it wasn't a naturalclosing process) It felt unsafe. I was disapointed because I expected better because it was a BUCK"
5,Great knife,Met all my expectations. I own many Buck knives and this is one of the best I own made by Buck. Very strong knife built like a tank.
1,zero worksmanship...........Not a good knife,"I bought this knife only to find out that Buck does not live up to expectations of a knife company that has been around for awhile. The rosewood handle was chiped and damaged. I requested a replacement for Amazone, and they did send me a new knife. This new knife was in worse condition than the first one. The knife it self looks to be a good knife, just don't purchase this one, buy the rubber handle one instead.One might be thinking ""why not contact the company"" well I did and they wanted to send the knife at my cost to get a replacement. My only problem was the worksmanship of the ""rosewood"" handle. why send back the whole knife?Anyhow that is my two cents. Buyer beware!!!!"
5,great knife,"Just what you would expect from buck, good balance, solid, should last forever.Nice folder with top quality sheath. Would recomend."
4,This town has dragged you down,"A _Dubliners_ for the Gen X sect, Graziano's work of short stories skillfully encapsulates the frustration and monotony of living lean in a small town with little hope for escape. Although the characters' lives are often intertwined, they're for the most part frozen in their own isolation and regret. The final story, ""Nor'easter"", offers a glimpse of real connection and, maybe, transcendence. Beneath the deadpan journalistic style, there's a great deal of pathos and humor. Especially amusing was ""The Big Gig,"" told from the perspective of a convenience store drone-cum-would-be punk rock star who struggles to hold onto his convictions in the face of certain failure, and the opener ""Padlocked,"" about a college student whose obsession with his diminutive, enigmatic roommate's secret habits yields disaster. An excellent first effort, I look forward to reading more."
5,Graziano's New Book Is Brilliant!,"I think that Nathan Graziano's new book, Frostbite, is so wonderful. The characters are people you could almost get to know. I thought the first two books were good...until I read this. Definitely worth reading!!!"
5,Incredible Bite Size Pieces of Guyon,This book is a terrific collection of parts of a book Guyon wrote to defend herself against the Spanish Inquisition. That three volume work is not published according to the introduction of this book but someone has taken parts of it and made this book. The wisdom and depth will stretch even the most devout believer and make him or her yearn for a continually deepening walk with our Lord. No need to be Catholic to read this one!! I highly recommend it to anyone that is serious about their walk with Christ.
1,Just another NEW AGE rant,I lost interest early in this book. Being a Christian it did not present what I needed and what I bought it for. I like to have reference books on had that give information without an agenda in mind. Something neutral and not promoting anything specific. Just the facts.
4,excellent book- full of rare information,"the book was well done- a bit long though. Also, a bit much on the New Age side, but full of good, hard to find, factual information not covered in the mainstrean or alternative presses. An excellent read"
2,A mix of real suppressed truths and utter baloney,David Icke manages to take a lot of genuine and generally ignored history of the schemes of the global economic elite and weave it together with his own special brand of way-out-there-ness. He is famous for claiming to have been the messiah (he no longer claims this) and that humans are ruled over by shape-shifting reptilians.The only reason this book gets 2 instead of 1 star from me is that it is worth understanding who people like Icke are and why they do what they do. It seems the idea is to discourage people from examining inconvenient historical truths by conflating them with truly bizarre claims.
4,mind boggling journey into the heart of darkness,"reminiscent of the R A Wilson Illuminatus trilogy, only with real-life players. Circles within circles within circles. While Icke tries to pull off a ""deus ex machina"" ending of hope and love, the factual evidence he presents leads to a pretty clear case of ""we are screwed"". Essential reading, but can be a bit overwhelming at times trying to keep track of all the players. Not for the faint of heart."
5,EXCELLENT,HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLERFAST SHIPPING - EXACTLY AS DESCRIBEDE X C E L L E N TE X C E L L E N TVERY EXCELLENT
3,Heavy Reading--Hard To Get Through,"The subject matter of Mr. Icke's book, ""And the Truth Shall Set You Free"", is one of great conspiracy. Conspiracy of many ""clubs"" and organizations in the world to create a one-world government, currency, and army. Mr. Icke tends to get his reader bogged down in the minute detail of names and dates and places where the beginning and execution of this plan are conspired. He also comes at the subject with a decidedly esoteric, New Age ""religion"" point of view.The information in the book is interesting to know. But, if you become easily angered by things out of your control, don't read this book."
3,Typical David Icke,"And the Truth Shall Set You Free is pretty typical David Icke. There's what I consider to be mostly good information mixed with bad information. Things I agree with, and things I disagree with. In this one he's particuarly hard on Israel/Mossad, not that they don't deserve it. What Icke does is pick through piles of various ""conspiracy"" related books and pieces other peoples research into his own work. The only variation is you throw in some new age overtones and ancient astronaut stuff. Nothing about the Reptilians in this one though. I don't think his books are bad but I wouldn't recomend them to a novice who is just starting to research the new world order because you have to be able to weed out a lot and discern a lot of information."
1,He channels (& trusts!) information from unseen entitites.,"""I accept that I am being guided, I have guides in other frequencies and other dimensions in life...""Icke has taken DMT (a drug that sometimes causes alien abduction ""experiences"") and had someone throw ""prophetic"" sticks on the ground to get ""truth."" He sees himself as an expert on spiritual realities & presents himself as a sort of guru.I think his actual agenda is to cause a spirit of fear and hopelessness in the masses while leading them away from saving truth with his dangerous doctrines - very similar to the NWO's doctrines which he is supposedly against. He pushes a new age philosophy very like Alice Bailey and ""the ascended masters"" and like them he hates & despises Yeshua, aka Jesus, and the Bible while trying to trash them whenever he can fit that in.Google David Icke Debunked."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book,"What this book fails to mention is that David Icke himself has claimed to be the son of god on national television (in the UK) among other things. He has also prophesied the destruction of New Zealand which was going to take place in 1991, along with massive tidal waves sweeping the Brittish coastline. That he has said these things are as well known in the UK as Clinton saying ""I did not have sex with woman."" David Icke is a first case nut trying to weave all the conspiracy theories of the world into one great mega consiracy (bottoming in ridiculous claims of extra terrestrials), never taking into account that human nature causes alliances to be broken as quickly as they are formed. I own this book, and can honestly say it was the worst money spent in my life, not to mention the time spent reading the presposterous claims in it. Take my advice: Don't waste yours!"
3,Hmmmm...,"I found this exceptionally interesting but I have to say I am not helped a great deal. I much preferred and am guided by a reality based novel I've just finished by Jerry Furland, ""Transfer-the end of the beginning"". Furland's book is stunning, where Icke is more froth and foam. Which is not to say I dismiss his work. I just find it, well, not as helpful."
1,"No truth here, don't bother.","Jesus is just a product of ET along with gods of Babylon who are genetically modified and created people. Bible credibility is questioned by mystery Babylon, Assyria, Greek, Roman, India and every other ungodly fables. Fables apparently much more credible the the Word of True GOD. Let's remember devil rarely uses bold lies. He uses some truth which he twists to deceive gullible and ignorant (not much changed since the fall of man). And again it is all Jews' fault.In the light of so grievous mistakes all other information is at best very questionable."
4,An early gem...,"David Icke sets a standard with ""...and the truth shall set you free"". This book is pretty much the foundation for all his future works and serves as a reference to those works as well.It is an outstanding book with interesting research, philisophical musings, and an interesting dogma-shattering perspective on life. Highly recommended."
5,"A must read by every man, woman and child on this planet!","There are no words to describe what the information in this book has done for me. Boy, are my eyes opened! David Icke takes so much information and weaves it together like a masterpiece. Laying it down so the average person can actually see what is going on behind the scenes and helps break us from the manufactured world we are expected to live in. He exposes so many things in great detail with extensive research and documentation. I am absolutely BLOWN AWAY ! I was fortunate enough to see this man speak at a conference and I highly recommend to everyone, if you ever have the chance to see him live...don't miss it! It is life changing."
5,Read this and your life will change forever...,"David Icke reveals some startling facts behind the people/events/organisations/ that have controlled and influenced our lives right up to the present day.I have a favourite saying - 'Everything you know is wrong'.Forget the 'news' reports focussing on Mr.Icke's sanity - once you've read what he has to say you'll realise why the controlled (& controlling) media, want his reputation ruined.Those who argue ""If what he says is true, he would have been bumped off by now"" just don't get it. Character assassination is the weapon of choice.Icke is a hugely courageous man."
1,He regurgitates every documentary,"No valuable sources and if you buy this book you are supporting the real lizard! If you pick it up at a garage sale for less than a dollar it will be money well spent. His books are not factual, not supported theories, just his own vomit on paper with no facts and he is obviously ADD, because he comes from one thought to another without a good transition. I actually have a friend who takes his words as gospel which shows you how dangerous this con really is."
2,Give me a break...,"I can't believe I got suckered into reading this poorly written, sci-fi fantasy. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty open-minded. However every few pages has Icke over-explaining his resoning for writing this book. I kept hoping the ""juicy"" stuff would show up after his endless philosophizing. Not so."
1,Straight-jacket?,"Anyone have one, because this author should be fitted for one! Or is he crazy like a fox, making this nonsense into a cottage industry to line his bank accounts! Oh, perhaps, that makes me part of the conspiracy? Dumb nonsense - thankfully, I borrowed it from the library and quickly too it back!"
1,plain daft amnd rathere feeble minded though,tremendously reseached and then again he gets all long windedsaid anough
1,Hilarious,"A man claims to be the son of good and writes a book about the imminent take over of the world by a lizard- like elite or 'illuminati'. (It would seem that only he can see this- continuing the son of god joke). A great raconteur who manages to 'link' many historical events. Apparently all his own material. A great future as a stand- up comedian, lies ahead of david."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this in the Fall of 2003 to be able to have a quick compass/elevation check on unfamiliar trails. It handles those tasks well.However, the strap breaks too soon compared to other watches. And band replacement is far too difficult compared to other watches. A slightly shorter replacement pin (or slightly bending a replacement pin to make it shorter) may be the only practical solution to a replacement problem if you're trying to do this in the field. Also, the back is difficult to remove (over the years) compared to other watches (a 1 Yuan coin seems to be the best fit for the slot on the back).The alarm is useless as it simply cannot be heard. The product manual is poorly written, which is odd because the Finns have great language skills.So, although I like the watch, the on-going maintenance issues make it less than highly recommended."
4,Great Watch,"This is a great watch, especially for small to medium build guys. It's a good size watch but it's not nearly the dinner plate replacement that some of it's ABC brethren are."
4,Suunto watch,"The product is great, although a mix-up with Parcelforce (delivering it in the UK) meant I received it three weeks late :("
2,Not worth the cost.,"Cute watch, but a number of fundamental problems:#1 - the alarm is useless! the volume is so low, you will have no hope of ever hearing it if you are asleep or there is any background noise. Too bad there are so many complicated features and options on this watch, and the only truly useful one they (Messed)!#2 - no, the altimeter doesn't work. What is the point on spending (Money) on an altimeter that may or may not be correct depending on the temperature? I have been at sea level, when the watch is showing +300 feet - even after re-calibration that same hour, the values are way off. For this price, I can buy a GPS that will give me the real altitude."
1,Not what I expected,"For the price I was expecting a good condition hard copy. The book was yellow with age and a paper back.The content is fabulous. It is truly an extremely interesting history of alchemy, bio-chemistry, and basic science.I loved the book. Everyone should KNOW this book. I recommend it highly. I just wish it was a hardback book."
3,love hate thing,the scent when fresh is outstandingly beautiful but it came stale all alcohol . my wife was very upset and refused me to reorder from here. they were understanding but it didn't help my wifes dissapointment. the rule here is no fragrance buying unless from a department store. I can tell you since that she choose to buy something elese since its a discontinued scent and only sold from discounters it wasn't worth another stale purchase. She loves her new scents chanel chance original and laura mercier l huere magique. so she made well. good luck if you made a fragrance choice here.
5,Mmm. Mmm. Good.,"This the lightest, most delicious fragrance. I would highly recommendit to anyone, male or female, who loves to smell fresh but does not wantto be over-powered by an artificial aroma. Wonderful stuff for which Ihave received numerous compliments."
3,MTV UNPLUGGED,"RECEVIED ON TIME, GOOD CONDITION, AFTER LISTENING TO BRUCE'S DVD'S WITH E STREET BANDTHIS WAS OK BUT NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECED FROM BAND. BRUCE WAS GOOD BUT AFTER LISTENTO HIS LIVE PERFORMANCES WITH E STREET BAND IN THE ALBUM ""LIVE IN BARCELONA"" HOWCAN HE BEAT THAT?"
5,amazing concert film--- the boss is king.,"This Springsteen concert film makes me very happy, causes some weeping, in fact it is a religious experience all around. He evokes at times the spirit of a religious revival. In particular, I like the ""Meet me tonight in Atlantic City"" lyrics and music, about unions and fighting for rights. I also like the ""Fifty seven channels and nothing's on"" theme that goes through more than one song. The Boss Lives!!!"
1,Flatliner,"Let me see if I get this straight: Bruce Springsteen, the lamest, schlockiest so-called ""rocker"" in the biz goes ""unplugged""? But wait! He then goes ""plugged,"" because his music is so gosh darned ""electric""!Truth be told, if you ""unplugged"" his flaccid tunes, you'd need to have a coroner present.It is beyond me how this flatliner ever became so popular, but then again, there're still a lot of balding baby boomers and New Jerseyites with mullets out there who still haven't gotten a transfusion of good taste.*Sigh*"
3,Bought and had to modify it,I agree with the other person in saying yes it does drip right through the top with the big hole. I had to sew it up. And also the big inconvience was that the picture shows that it covers the childs feet and that for sure is a false picture. I used it at the zoo and my childs feet were soak and wet by the time we got to the car because their feet were showing and there is no way to pull the cover down..very unsatisfied..i now had to come home and sew on an extended piece of waterproof material to cover down to the wheels...DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND MORE MONEY FIXING IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
5,Jack Corbett Mariner is a Must Read,"Our entire family loved this book (2 adults, chlidren ages 15, 13, 10 and 8) and we were so intrigued by Alfredrick Hatch we did a little further research. Mr. Hatch liquidated much of his amazing fortune after a stock market crash to make sure none of his investment clients lost money. The Rockefellers didn't do this. The Goulds didn't do this. The Kennedys didn't do this. But for Alfredrick Hatch, his word was vastly more important than his money. By the way, you won't find this story in Mr. Hatch's book. This book wasn't written to impress. It was written to entertain and entertain it does!"
3,It is a documentary of what happened,"I read ""The Ship"" by CSF recently and love it. You are there on a British light cruiser during an important action. This book is a light weight read. It could be called a documentary. If you saw the movie ""Sink the Bismark!"" you will find nothing new. There is little psycholigical insight. It is just an interesting piece and is worth reading but ""The Ship"" is a mile ahead of this one."
3,An okay Mystery,"I thought that this book by Ellen Hart, the third in the Jane Lawless mystery series, was a little slow moving at first. I didn't really get interested into the book until Jane started discovering the deep and dark secrets about the Werness family, and it seemed like it took her a while to do this. Although I found it slow moving, once Jane started uncovering different clues, I found that it was an easy and interesting read. I would guess that it's probably a better book if you read the two before it in the series - that way you know a little more about Jane."
2,Good Mystery,Even with all the holiday madness I was able to complete this story. Interesting and intriguing book.
5,my favourite book!,"contrary to other opinions,i believe this little book is one of the best!sure its small but you get a heap of houses,with a 'short but sweet' story.most have a floor plan, but all have great photos.a picture tells a thousand words.not a coffee table book because its always in someones hand being quickly read through and dreaming of these places!buy it. its a bargin"
5,Still going strong,"I purchased both the salt and pepper mills as a gift for my foodie husband. They are sleek and durable, and work great. He loves them. We've had them for about 4 years and they look and work as well as they did brand new!!! These would make an excellent wedding gift as well."
3,Disappointing,"I'm not sure what happened here. I actually wanted to rate this two stars and a half, but that's not possible, so I've decided to be generous. For the characters in this book were likable enough but the plot and story was slow and awkward, and frankly, I became very bored halfway through the book and had to put it down for a few days before I could finish it. The strange thing is that when I read Ms. Cannell's next book, a second Ellie Haskell mystery, it was so good, exactly the quality I had been expecting from Down The Garden Path. I think Ms. Cannell's Ellie Haskell books are her best and there her talent shows. But as for the others...quite frankly, God Save the Queen was even worse than this one in it's way."
1,Yuck!,"I love her books, but this was boring, hard to follow or ""get into."" You may love it, but I didn't even finish reading the book."
1,Down the Garden Path is Right!,"I found this book almost impossible to read:the characters were either weird for weird's sake or just silly. The ""heroine"" was forever speculating on people's characters without a clue as to what makes people do what they do; she kept doing stupid things to further the (nearly non-existent) plot. I read and rather enjoyed The Thin Woman, but this book was not only a terrible mystery; it was a terrible book. For really excellent British mysteries read anything by Elizabeth George or Martha Grimes."
3,Does the job.,"This charger does the job.It charges at an acceptable rate which is less than the Motorola AC charger.There is a humming sound when the radio is on.The cigarette lighter plug plastic separated after a few months but still works.It still does the job, but is not Palm quality"
1,Would not recommend,"I bought this from TigerDirect, filled it with music, waited forever for it to index, only to have it suffer multiple HD crashes within a day of normal use. I got it to come back to life a few times, until finally it stayed dead. I think the problem with this is that it's a hard drive (moving parts) and cannot withstand even the slightest movement. I was really disappointed."
1,Dont recommend,"Bought this couple of months back but never able to play any songs so far.It gets hang, everytime I start playing the songs and the reset will index all the songs again.I dont recommend anyone buying this though the price is less."
4,Entempo Spirit 20: not bad for the price,"Have had my Entempo Spirit a few weeks now.$99.00 from J&R; via Amazon.My first MP3 Player.Have WMP 10 as interface.Spirit works fine as a MP3 device: output connected via mini headphone jack to my Bose radio aux input via mini to RCA adapter.Sounds great,all 120+ cd's, about 1800 songs.I play music, usually, onTRACKSwith random and repeat mode on,so I have constantly changing genre's and decent quality output.Having a bit of challenge in setting playlists, as is seems I have to do this manually on the device itself, via playlist manager, unless Entempo creates or has a softwarethat allows a PC interface from PC to Spirit for playlist.Or, unless someone can tell me how to set a playlist and transfer it from PC to Entempo.For $99.00, I can not complain at all!And it is useful as a portable 20GB hard drive.Anyone who knows of any good forums for Entempo, please advise.[...]"
2,Spirit 20 mp3 player not user friendly,"I purchased this from J & R three days ago. It seemed like a great buy! After all no other player offered these features at this price point: 20Gb hard drive, FM radio, voice recorder, large LCD display, etc. There's great potential here. But it's just not user friendly. Uploading files is quick and easy using WM player or simply Windows Explorer. But accessing the music files was sometimes a pain. The player's controls were intermittently unresponsive and took extra steps to navigate. I feel that it's worth the $99 for the external HD alone but as a mp3 player it leaves something to be desired."
5,A Great Live Collection,"This box set is better than ""So Many Roads"" and the price is well worth it. It is as good as any of the ""Dick's Picks"" also."
3,Good...but there is better,"This cd is definitely good listening but for a Fillmore East show it does not hold up against Dicks Pick #4(Fillmore Feb 70). The sound mix on this new CD while good does not pick up the bass and Weir's rythm guitar [lacks] as clearly as they deserve to be heard. To see what I mean, compare Uncle Johns Band on this new CD versus the one on Dicks Picks #4,no comparison. Still...its is a fun listen of the good old days and to hear Pigpen in top form(probably for the last time).Each or the 4CD's are nice little trips in diffent but unique ways."
1,this or kattle prod?,"Like I dont understand the attraction of this band , like their sound is so ho-hum and boring that i think I will go for that cattle prod."
2,Ethan - SC,"The best thing about this collection is the packaging, otherwise I find very little to recommend it. Yes, Pigpen is all over the place and proves once and for all that he was truly the heart of the original Dead. Still, even as a huge fan of this period in the Dead's history, I find this title to be bloated and flat. 'At Fillmore East 2/11/69' is vastly superior despite the short sets. And is there any better 'Hard to Handle' than on 'Fallout From The Phil Zone'? And honestly, doesn't every other commercially available collection from '71 just kill? I love the Dead, I love the songs here, but this is just one pot that refuses to boil. Maybe it's the mix. One things for sure, the Dead always rose above when playing NYC but this time around they sound either tired or burned out or just plain lazy. For completists only."
4,One of the Dead's best CDs,"Many highlights and nice tune selection overall, with better sound quality than most of the Dick's Picks CDs. The performance is from their peak era and mostly uptempo. Weaknesses are fairly limted: Pigpen's neanderthal yowlings, and an anemic rendition of Wharf Rat with missing chords and lyrics. There are exceptional jams/medleys on discs 3 and 4, among their best work ever published."
2,I've never heard of a king bee before,"If you have never heard Grateful Dead before know this: Pigpen's singing (I use the word loosely) leaves a lot to be desired. I will give him a single prop for his reading of ""Good Lovin'."" Normal singers present some cool renditions here like ""Cumberland Blues"" and ""Truckin."" But theres too much 'Pen here for me. Luckily, 1970 saw only two studio tracks released bearing Pigpen's singing."
5,Encore encore,I have listened to a lot of dead material. This collection is perhaps the livliest. Very good blend of tunes. Lot of music here for the money. All around great listening. Good for a new Dead fan to experience.
5,"""Skull & Roses Volume 3""","""Ladies & Gentlemen..."" along with ""Three From The Vault"" could easily be dubbed ""Skull & Roses"" Volumes 2 + 3. This collection from the Dead's historic Spring '71 series of dates at the Fillmore East captures the raw, energetic, ""wall of sound"" Grateful Dead at their best. This release could also be considered 'the Best of Pigpen' as no other recording to date captures the influence the late Ron 'Pigpen' McKernan had on the Dead's sound during this period. Songs featuring Pigpen, rarely performed live include ""Next Time You See Me"" ""Ain't It Crazy (The Rub)"" ""I'm A King Bee"" & ""Good Lovin"". More familiar Pigpen tunes such as ""Hurts Me Too"" the long jam on ""Midnight Hour""and a blistering ""Turn On Your Lovelight"" get a serious workout. The overall selection of songs performed that night span the full length of the Dead's career. If you dig ""Skull & Roses"" and ""Bear's Choice"" you'll LOVE ""Ladies & Gentlemen..."""
5,"Don't think, just buy it!","A must have for all who enjoy the Dead's music. This set finds the band hitting one of it's legendary high points. While the vocals and timing can be a little rough at times, the jamming, solos, and group interaction are some of the best ever committed to disc. If you liked ""Skull and Roses"" (a much more polished, big label, incarnation of this Fillmore East run) you will love to have this fuller, more fleshed out version. Also, these discs finally get Pigpen into the act, whereas recent releases by the Dead camp have sidestepped his contributions. The sound is incredible and lively, the crowd is very much a part of it, but not overbearing, which helps the listener get a feel for what it must have been like to be at these shows. Even if you are new to the Dead's music this is a good place to start because it gives a good cross section of the countrified material and their jamming, balls to the wall, era."
4,Near the End of an Era.,I just want to say that after pig died I stopped being in love with the band. I still liked them sort of; but the affair was over. They just got to cute after that. Pig gave them edge. Everyone knows that.Does anyone remember the New Years show that was simulcast on FM and Public TV. That was a great show. Must have been 70 or 71. R.I.P. Ron.
2,Cat's claws against a chalkboard,The first song is fantastic but some of the other songs grate on my nerves like a cat's claws against a chalkboard - in my mind the cd is worth buying just for the first song - it's incredible.
2,Not as good as Thin Tastes Better,"If you have to choose between this book and Thin Tastes Better (by the same author), buy Thin Tastes Better. This book, while it has a few recipes, is mostly a retread of the information in the other book.Two things were particularly annoying: 1) his insistence that you banish foods you have a problem overeating completely from your life, thereby reinforcing the belief that the food is in control and not you; and 2) constant mentioning by brand name of ""diet"" foods that have ingredients and additives that are objectionable to many people looking for healthy food. It would have been better to just mention what you should look for in quality healthy diet fare. Mentioning brand names also makes the book dated when items go out of production and are no longer available.Borrow from the library to read, or buy used."
2,Didn't impress me...,"I have a friend who loved this book...but, for me, anyone who suggests hot dogs and Splenda in a diet book is off my list!"
5,"The Incredible Dieter's ""Missing link""","The Thin Commandments Diet is not your run of the mill book on dieting! Dr. Gullo not only offers insights into why we we fail at dieting (or rather how diets fail us), but he also details simple, yet revolutionary strategies for handling any eating situation. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has tried and failed to lose weight, as I believe it is truly is the missing link that brings together all of the factors, necessary to FINALLY lose weight and keep it off for the rest of one's life!"
1,WHERE IS MY PRODUCT,"I have not received this item, I have tried tracking it down with no luck please help my doggies are waiting for this christmas gift lol"
3,Hardcore,"Well, if you're into harcore punk, fight I wanna beat your face in music this cd is for you. If not I highly recommend you steer clear. I have to be in a certian mood to listen to this cd otherwise all the screaming and harsh guitars are a bit much."
2,Not exactly what I expected,This item was brand new and somebody could probably use it but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. It fits my HTC Inspire but only after I take off my protective hard rubber case. I bought that to protect the phone and don't trust the snap in case if I drop the phone. The product was fine but not for me. I will do something with it.
1,Junk,"I bought one of these mainly because it was the only holster offered that doesn't also need a case - I didn't want something too bulky. Sure it was $10 and fits what I wanted but what a piece of junk. I broke it within 4 months of use. I am very good to my phones and devices/cases and this thing simply wore out due to use. It's major failing point is the 2 plastic nubs that hold the ""spring"" in place for the clip to stay closed. The nubs break off leaving the holster worthless.In saying that, the case holster is built very cheaply (hence the price) but also the clip that holds the phone in is terrible as it doesn't close over the phone all the way so it is not as secure as it should be while in the holster.I would seriously recommend buying something else as a holster for your phone than this piece of junk. Gone through 2 of them now, should have just bought something else to begin with..."
1,You get what you pay for.,Does a poor job of holding phone. Phone easily falls out. Clip broke one day after 100 day warranty and company will not honor anything.
2,so so,"I have been looking for a replacement for the Harry and Davids fig Balsamic, which had a soft moderate balsamic flavor. This product is not very close to that."
4,Great mood music,"I had this cassette tape and couldn't play it anymore, took a while to find the CD, really glad I did. This is his best work in my opinion."
5,great work,"The song Why Me has been responsible for me changing my mind about how much more I would rather pinch pennies than blow a hundred dollars time and again. The music makes me feel good. So good, it made me wonder if I would have as much fun if I went to a big country ballroom to hear Delbert McClinton sing live and try to dance to it. I have considered myself crazy before, but enjoying a line about dropping a hundred bill every time I turn around convinced me to stay home. Never Been Rocked Enough told me the story of my life."
5,Must have,"If I hadn't owned any Delbert McClinton music and recommended a CD to pick up, this would be my recommendation. He was young enough to have a strong clear voice when needed and old enough to get it right. He moved into more of a rock sound and it is truly supurb. I love it along with Nothing Personal and One of the Fortunate Few. Do yourself a favor and pick it up."
4,Great Introductory Reference,"This book contains information about many important and influential artists, as well has good quality color examples of their work. It covers a large amount of artists, their backgrounds and styles, but if you want to really get into depth with one author, this isn't your book."
4,thanks,"The book was in good condition, arrived in time. Unfortunately the class was one I couldve gotten away with not buying the text. Whatevs, thanks!"
5,Excellent Overall,Fully satisfied with this purchase. Shipment was fast. The quality of the book was very good. Excellent overall. Will do buisness again.
5,Cookin,"Well this album just cooks. I miss this style of southern rock. Toy was Marshal Tucker the other members were absolutly fantastic , but I don't know of anyone who could write a song as good as he did. If you buy this cd you must buy Toy's Live Can't you see. Just listening to them makes you realize what a talent he truly was."
5,Available.......,This is a fantastic CD and it's available brand new for [...]. Every fan of American Southern music should own a copy. Toy Caldwell was one of our greatest guitarists and songwriters.
3,A good reference,"This is a good left-brain book. It is well organized. Everything about gender in one section, adjectives in another section, and verb endings in another section, unlike my current text book, which skips around a lot. I studied French on my own for two years with moderate success, then started in a class. I continue to use this book as a grammar reference because the index is very functional. One weakness is that there are no cassettes or CD's directly tied to this book."
3,Only good as a reference,"If I were to learn French from scratch through this book, I would have given up in no time. The structure of this book is totally not for real beginners. However, since I have already studied some the ABC's of French, I find this book to be very useful as a reference book. Quite a few things are explained in detail and repeatedly that the reader may feel progress is slow but is actually learning something. The content is 4 stars but the layout is only 2 stars. Borrow it from the library to check it out!"
3,Good reference book,This is a good book for reference and it is packed with all kinds of information. It is too bad that it does not come with a CD or tape. It is an interesting book to read but it contains a lot of information about France that not everyone may be intereted in. Overall I would recommend it and it is very reasonably priced.
2,"Book is great, but CD are terrible","I noticed that several reviewers did not get a CD with this book. If you look at the cover though you should have a CDROM with the book. The AV book CD looks like it should really be great, but the CD FAILs to install properly. I have contacted the publisher, but have not had any luck resolving this problem. I think the book is very good. I think there should be more comprehensive exercises, though!"
3,Good pronounciation guide,"I got this book because it has a pronounciation guide after most of the french. I haven't seen this in other french learning books. I put the DVD in and was unhappy that it started at the beginning of the book and read right through. I could not skip pages nor go back. So, I think something is wrong with the DVD, as noted from another writer's review. The second time I tried to bring up the DVD, it only gave me an error code."
4,Funniest Thing Ever Guaranteed!!!,"If you like to watch MTV's jackass you will love this, it stars Bam Margera, Brandon Dicamillo, Ryan Dunn, and lots more. The video is comprised of Skateboarding, and funny skits from a team of jackass's. One skit contains The guys renting a car then trashing it totally then returning it to the rent a car. If you love those shopping carts you love them in this video. Perhaps the sickest thing of all is Ryan Dunn when he gets urinated on then has Poop smeared in his face. All and all if you love jackass this is a must get!!"
3,Not as good as expected,"When you know something is coming from the guys who do TV's Jackass, you get high expectations. At least, if your like me, you do.Well, this certainly didn't cut it.Granted, it had a few humerous moments. But there wasn't much worth laughing out loud at. Or even chuckling at. Or giggling.Not worth buying. Just record some of the Jackass episodes and watch those. Thats better. I promis."
5,cky2k the rise and fall of modern non-comunistic society,in this movie we such stars as Bam Margera Jess Jess The Gill and Rake Yohn. while there is not as much rake yohnage as we would have liked to see in this film there is enough to suffice many people do not know the power rake yohn holds rake is the only being with the power to rule all of the globe in the day rake was jesus' best freind then rake led crusaders to the holy land he was also george washington's right hand man so if rake yohn is in any movie it should get five starspeace out
4,Did he just....?,"Okay, so I'm way behind the times. This vid was my introduction to the CKY boys (4 years after its release) and I've never seen Jackass. I'm not usually into the low-brow stuff but I was laughing so hard I nearly puked 8 times. After viewing the video, my bros and I were so inspired, we severely damaged ourselves (and each other) trying to pull off some drunken skate tricks, then started several fires in the parking lot and a few more in the apartment we were chillin at. Serious good times. If you're a fan of toilet humor and skate films, do this one!!!!"
2,Borrrrring!,"I don't know where they dug up this collection of movies but I am rarely able to sit all the way through one. Most of these would make great MST3K or Film Crew fodder. In fact, the most fun I had watching these was making up my own comments and jabs."
2,"Didn't get what I wanted, not worth it.","I really wanted this beautiful sink. The two different-sized bowls, and the unbeveled lower rim were just what I was looking for! HOWEVER, the first time I ordered it, I received an EMPTY BOX. Yes, it was actually delivered empty to my apartment manager. So I returned the empty box as requested, and was sent a replacement order. HOWEVER, what I got was sink model DSK954-18, instead of the one I wanted. I was in the middle of moving from my apartment to my new house, so I decided not to fuss with this company again. Since the sink appeared to be good quility, I installed it at my new house. It had far fewer securing brackets than I expected for such an expensive sink.Overall, the experience just wasn't worth the money I paid. I will never order from this company again."
1,The Bible is prophecy!,The author suggests that it's not important that we know 'correct prophetic' information of the Bible but rather it's more important to act 'Christian'. Prophecy is as much a part of the Bible as any other part of the Bible - if we cannot learn the meanings of prophecy then we cannot know the Bible.
2,No Time to have any fun!,"This would be a great game if only they'd give you time to play it! You have to collect evidence, listen to eyewitness testimony, do lab reasearch, run around town talking to this guy and that before trial starts in 10 minutes! Its insane! I wish I'd have saved my money on this one."
3,Not Bad!,"Ive played both ""D.A Pursuit of Justice"" amd ""Pusruit of Justice"" and I find both games reasonably good. Well If you are expecting great graphics and good quality cutscenes, forget it. The grahics are far from that. However, the entire theme of the game is very good. Its one of the very few Law-Based games available on the PC. This game is not only for those who love the T.V series ""The Practice"",and want their profession in the field of Law, rather its also for those , who just want to experience how it is to be a Criminal Lawyer. You only have 4 days to prepare a case which ,frankly, is too short a time to prepare a good case. Well, first you have to create a case, having both sufficient evidence aswell as primary witnesses.Then you go to court. It takes several tries to win the case. By the way, the opposition is tough and can make you lose, when you think you're winning."
2,yes and no,This BP cuff looks pretty sturdy and the dial is easy to read and all that but I have had problems getting an accurate reading. The inflating rubber balloon in the cuff does not surround the arm so if you don't have it just right it doesn't inflate correctly. Also you have to make sure the cuff is very tight when you put it on or you will be pumping it up for a long time. This makes it awkward using on someone with arms that are much larger near the shoulder and smaller near the elbow. You just don't get a good reading.
1,Large BP cuff,THis was not a large cuff. I was surprised to see its size today.. I would like to replace it.
1,Poor quality blood pressure cuff,"This item did appear as advertised and included the carrying case. However, it is overall a poor quality blood pressure cuff. I was unable to get an accurate reading. It took too long to pump up and then immediately began leaking air with the valve closed. Turning the valve even slighlty released too much air. I returned this item, which cost me over half the price of the item to ship back. Buyer beware!"
1,poor execution,"Ordered this product because my Cardiologist said I needed an Adult 'Large' BP Cuff. I was sent an Adult 'Regular' BP cuff. They accepted my return properly, but I never had any oppotunity to speak to anyone about this. If there is a phone number somewhere, it's pretty well buried. Not acceptable when ordering medical supplies or equipment. I ended up going to a local medical suply store to get the right thing. This was the first time I was dis-satisfied with my Amazon experience."
2,BP Cuff,"I don't recomend this cuff, the valve on the bulb doesn't let out air like normal cuffs. it will not let out air if you have your finger on the valve, so turn it a little and let go for it to release any air."
2,mediocre,"I've been disappointed in the quality of the cuff. The value to release pressuse does not work well and is difficult to use. Additionally, unless you have gigantic arms (mine are bigger than average), this is not the cuff for you, it's huge."
2,Get what you pay for,It shows my BP to be 40 mmHg above what it shows on a hospitals electric BP machine.. May be better to spend a little more money to get better quality.
4,Blood Pressure Cuff,"The cuff is fine but I thought it was just an ""Adult"" size when I ordered it. So I ordered the wrong item but the delivery was fast."
3,Great Story of Love and Forgiveness,"The Story of Warner and Marin ""Redemption"" is one that can be admonished by many. Warner and Marin meet at a church conference and Warner is certain that God spoke to him and told him to take Marin as his wife. The two marry some months later and the trials and tribulations begin. I'll leave it at that, don't want to give the story away. This book is both inspirational and a great read. I really admire Warner's faithfulness and his loyalty to God and his marriage. We need more Warner's in the world. This book will encourage all who read it. If you don't have this book, i recommend you pick up a copy,you won't regret it."
4,"Reading ""Redemption"" is a very satisfying experience....","The author, Jacquelin Thomas, uses the relationship of Reverend Warner Brice and his wife, Marin to place major emphasis on two distinctive points of the novel: (1) to forgive others in the same manner as our God offers us His divine forgiveness, and (2) to love others as our God loves us. Reverend Brice tells his congregation, ""Once we fully forgive, our minds are released from the bondage of anger, bitterness, and resentment"". Warner also asked his congregation to follow God's example of love. This would be displaying a love that always protects, always trust, always hopes, and always perseveres."
5,Great Book,The book brings the stories in the bible to life...reading the book made the story of gomer and hosea make so much since. The one thing I do like is after you read the book you can turn in your bible to that story and see the similaries. God has truely given you a wonderful gift. Keep using it to gorify God
5,Love it,I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down once I picked it up. I read it from the begin to the end in one day.
4,Very Good Read,"This book hits the nail on the head. There are going to be reprecussions for your actions at some point in your life. But, with forgiveness you can overcome anything."
4,Cute story with vibrant illustrations,"We love the illustrations. They are vibrant, cartoony-almost a little Japanese looking. I think the illustrations are a little more intriguing than the text, which is very short. I would say that this book wouldn't hold the interest of a child over 4. That said, my kids like the pictures very much, especially the duck that follows the young girl. They are delighted every time we reach the page where the duck finds the girl's dropped scarf. They also like the the picture at the end where the duck and the rabbits share a piece of the family's pie. Cute book that is worth having."
5,Haunting images,"This was a favorite book of mine as a child - the images have stayed with me all these years, especially Oscar trying to get home at night through the dark woods. I remember finding it a little scary, but maybe that's what made it so memorable."
5,kitty's review,"I am loving the variety of music especially for this being their first album. Most of my favorite Janne Da Arc songs are from this album. It has a nice combination of beautiful but very upbeat and easy to dance to music like ""Fantasia"" and ""So Blew"" to hard rock songs like ""Judgement Shinigami No Kiss"" and ""More Deep"". ""Speed"" seems to be right in the middle ^_^This is very impressive for a band's first album."
4,"Sara was ""Born to Fly""...","This is a wonderful album from Sara. While it is much more pop-country than her previous ones, it still retains that Sara sound. It was a huge hit for Sara spawning four hits for her, and thrusting her into the spotlight. It has many great songs on it, there are no fillers that's for sure. On ""Born to Fly"" She sings about knowing she was destined for great things, and on ""Saints and Angels"" Sara reflects on a relationship that makes two people whole. On ""I keep Lookin'"", a song every woman will relate to, Sara sings about wanting more in life, whether it's your hair or your love life!A must-have for any Sara fans.Choice Tracks:Born To FlySaints and AngelsI could not ask for MoreI Keep Lookin'I Learnt that from youEvery little Kiss"
5,Highly Recommended CD,"An excellent CD by one of today's most talented country singers. This CD is more pop-sounding than Sara's previous CD's but for those who like today's country sound, you will thoroughly enjoy this one. Lots of upbeat songs and some beautiful ballads. If you like Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Shania Twain, etc., Sara will become another of your favorites."
2,My Fiance Loves It,"I bought this album for my fiance last year. Its not quite my taste, but she truely loves it. In accordance, my opinion is rather biased since I prefer classic country. If you are a fan of more modern country, this may a great album for you. You may rate it higher than I did, according to your musical taste. Give it a listen, and decide for yourself."
4,Great Country music,"I love this CD. I give it 4 stars only because there are a few songs I really enjoy, but they are all good."
5,Next Big Thing?,"Sara Evans might just be the NBT if she stays on track as the tracks on this CD attest. Arrangements are tight but support her vocals. There's an argument here for self-produced projects which this is. She avoids the industry standard schlock charts and cornball cliches ground out by that famous Tennessee city. Best track? It has to be ""I Learned That From You"". Haven't we all been THERE at one time or another?MG"
5,Get this!!!!,"I love this album!! Sara's voice is fantastic and I love her lyrics. I love Every Little Kiss and Born to Fly. She definitely sounds more country than most of the ""country"" played on the radio now. This is an absolutely wonderful buy."
2,Really A Let Down,"Rarely will a song grab and hold me the VERY first time I hear it but the wonderful ""I Could Not Ask For More"" did just that. Finally after hearing it about three times I bought the CD and have to say I am VERY dissappointed. I have now listened to the entire CD five times and cannot get into it. I really find most of the songs to be very bland. I love her voice and maybe I expected too much. There are some nice ones.. ""Born To Fly and ""Four Thirty"" come to mind. I really wish ""I Could Not Ask For More"" had been a CD Single. I coulda saved my money. Sorry, Sara... I really wanted to like this but it is just too bland and uninteresting."
5,she's got it!,There is no other way to describe any of sara evans cd's but to say that they are perfect!
4,I could not ask for more touched my heart,"I have only heard one song on this CD, but that one song has sold me. The song is ""I could not ask for more"" and I dedicate this song to my husband. It is a known fact that music is the eyes of the world and when a song like this comes out, people can relate and reflect. I look forward to hearing the rest of the CD which I intend to purchase as soon as possible."
2,Disappointing country,This is a very disappointing album for a country lover. I can't understand how someone who sings Suds in the Bucket (from Restless) can come out with such a crass pop album good for 14 year olds. The only good song is I learnt that from you. Too bad...
1,Is this a joke??,"Would the real Sara Evans please stand up, as the artist on this release must be an imposter. If you particularly enjoyed Sara's two previous releases, this will be a hugh disappointment. Three tracks musically and one track vocally sound like a Corr's rip-off, the remainder is 'middle of the road' girlie pop a-la Spice Girls - following the current trend for 'Country' artists (particularly female) to become more and more pop oriented mainstream, ie. Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, etc. This album will probably appeal to the younger pop generation, 'Country' it is not. Someone needs to save Sara from herself, as she has a talent that is signicficantly greater than the material on this CD - avoid it like the plague."
2,A major disappointment,"The Twainization that ruined Patty Loveless's new album -- her only dud in a gallery of gems -- blands out Sara Evans this time around. She's a great singer and she seems to be trying valiantly to drum up some drama here (although the more passion she invests the more she underscores the emptiness of the songs); these songs are fluff and formulaic for the most part -- I cringed when I saw Diane Warren (please!) was represented here. Sara said she was going to go pop because people weren't buying her country records. Well, maybe she'll get more airplay, but she's sacrificed her country soul. If you're going to go pop at least do so with some some decent tunes (a la Trisha Yearwood). What a waste of a major talent."
4,some really great songs...,"i really like this cd, some really good lyrics and a good sound. the album has a very nice flow to it, it's a nice album to listen to. the songs ""Saints and Angels"", ""I Keep Looking"" (can't really argue ;)there is always something...),""I learned that from you"", ""Let's Dance"", ""you don't"" and ""Four-Thirty"" are the ones i think is the best on this album.... This is a good album worth a listen."
4,Sara Steps Out,"When Sara Evans emerged on the scene in 1997, she seemed to be a neo-traditionalist in the vein of fellow newcomer Lee Ann Womack and the great Patty Loveless. With No Place That Far in 1998, she began to merge the country side with slight country-pop leanings. Born To Fly completes this transformation, with the country-pop taking dominance on the album. That said, this is a great country-pop album, straddling the fence without going the Faith/Shania route. Saints and Angels is one of the best songs I've heard all year, and she actually makes the Diane Warren composition I Could Not Ask For More sound like something other than a throwaway track. This album should firmly establish Evans as one to watch."
5,Amazingly Beautiful,"Of course, it's not your ""twang"" country but Sara Evans definitely sweeps you away in an outstanding performance. Ranging from solid country, such as ""Born to Fly,"" to her moving ballad, ""I Learned That From You,"" Sara Evans lifts the listener off their feet and takes them to a new dimension. With her wonderful voice and wonderfully written songs, one could not ask for more. In her third album, Sara proves she is just as great, if not better, than some long time country crooners. In my opinion, Sara Evans is now a member of the big leagues! This album is proof! If you like tear jerkers, upbeat music, and a beautiful voice, this is a must for you! Of course, don't take my word for it, listen to it for yourself!!"
3,You're in the army now...,"A certain Dragon, Fornia, steals a sword. Morrolan wants the sword, so he starts a campaign against Fornia. Vlad has taken a dislike to Fornia, so he enlists in Morrolan's army to get the sword back. And during the course of the book, he discovers how unpleasant life can be in the army...The longer you read, the more interesting it gets. (I really don't like it when Vlad is being introspective, though, but there isn't much of that in this one.)It isn't the best book ever, but it's a Vlad book and thus a must-read. Especially since Vlad's Dragon friends are in top form, Morrolan being haughty and nonchalant, Sethra knowledgeable and mysterious, and Aliera fiery and ruthless as ever."
4,A change of pace for the Taltos series,"This is one of my favorite books from the Vlad Taltos series. This book is slightly different from the other books in the series in that a majority of the action concerns Vlad's time in the army. But the style of writing and sense of humor is still intact, along with Vlad's sidekick/pet LoioshOne of the only problems that I have with this book, and a minor problem at that, is that several different timeframes will be on the same page with no real seperation between them. Once you get used to it you'll be fine, but a bit confusing.You can start the series with this book, but you be better off starting with Taltos and trying to read the series in chronological order as opposed to publication order."
2,Self-indulgent,"More and more, Steven Brust's books seem to be about Steven Brust's books. Endless recursive references and in-jokes do not a fiction make."
5,Why can't I give it 6 stars?,"I loved this book, and all the other Vlad Taltos books. I read this, and the others over and over, scanning for some highly creative wittisism that I missed the 1st-9th time! Vlad Taltos is the Anti-hero all fantasy fans love to love!"
1,Quickly and tritely tiresome,"This book starts out as a light, reasonably witty, if pedestrian fantasy. However, Mister Bruske uses the same three of four comedy techniques over and over and over. Before long it becomes obviously predictable, then boring, then tedious, and finally downright annoying. One of the techniques he uses frequently is to have the Hero(?) start some narrative that has nothing to do with the story, stop in the middle and say, ""Oh, never mind"" or ""But that's another story"" or some such equally trite drivel. About half way through the book, I decided that was an excellent suggestion."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A conflict is at hand in the house of the Dragon. It appears that it is all to do with a group of magical weapons that Morrolan has in his possession. He hires Vlad to help with his security.Vlad agrees, but one of them ends up going missing anyway. This leaves Morrolan at war with another dragon, and Sethra Lavode becomes involved.She talks Vlad into joining the infantry, which he does, fighting as a grunt, and also using his 'work' skills to do a bit of special forces type work in the dark.A conversation with a Serioli, Morrolan, and Vlad tells us more about the Great Weapons and Spellbreaker, and Aliera and Sethra the Younger become involved, both wanting a weapon, at the end."
3,A good book for insiders,"This was a fun book, but it's definitely not for anybody who wasn't already reading Stephen Brust's Vlad books.Still, a good read for diehard Brust fans."
2,Maybe I am not the right audience,"The prose is just terrible. Even though I feel like an english professor saying this I really do not like the language that is being used. This is the first book I have read by this author and it will the the last. The characters are interchangeable. They have no significant traits and the supposedly snappy replies and witty dialogues between the mostly smartass characters are very tiresome after the first 50 pages. Maybe this book was not written for someone like me and maybe the comparison isn't fair, but compared to George R. Martins books this is bad at best. If I have to say one good thing about the book I'd say that the plot is moving fast and the story in itself is quite entertaining."
5,A touching story of parental love,"This story really touched us to the bottom of our hearts. It expresses exactly our emotions about being mother and father. Reading the book out to our two kids, we felt so close to them. In an artistically simple way, this book tells what parental love really means. The scene of Father turtle telling his son that his greatest wish has always been to become a father is so sweet and tender, it brings tears to our eyes every time we read it. A simply beautiful book!"
5,Best new band I've heard in years,"From start to finish, this album rocks. I like the new-wave influences, the edgy pop-punk guitar work, and the pounding bass lines. Song faves are upbeat, pounding ""Hustle Rose,"" ""The List,"" and ""Combat Baby,"" and slow songs ""Calculation Theme"" and ""Love is a Place."" But every song on this CD is fabulous, and I find myself singing lyrics like ""every ten-year old enemy soldier thinks falling bombs are shooting stars sometimes..."" (IOU)If you get a chance to see this group live, don't miss it. They are even more electric and edgy, plus you get to see the sexy Ms. Emily Haines shake her groove thang."
4,GREAT album.,"I cannot say enough good things about this album. This is one of those rare albums where every track is a winner. I don't have a favorite track, I love all of them! I suppose the musical style of Metric is a wonderful fusion of pop/rock/alternative/new wave. This album is a blast. I encourage anyone reading this to just give them a try. Metric is one of the more overlooked bands and they deserve recognition. The only reason I am not giving this five stars, is I reserve those for real classics that stand the test of time. I've been listening to this for over a year or so, but i want to give it a bit more time before I decide if it's five star worthy."
5,hot!,"I first heard about Metric from a friend and ignored the recommendation until she bought me the CD for my birthday and ever since then, i can't seem to stop listening to it! If you like catchy guitar riffs and 80s type pop, this album is definitely for ya. Enjoy!"
4,Recorded. Such a shame.,"Let me start by preliminarily agreeing with most of the other reviewers in that Metric is indeed a very good band. The catch is that, like most emerging underground bands, their sound is crafted for the stage, not the recording studio. Although the CD is still quite listenable - the fresh style far outdoing most of today's comparatively drab music - the band is far more impressive in person. If you ever get the chance to see them, be sure not to miss it."
2,Maybe in a Couple of Years.,"I was very excited to get this album after having Dead Disco in my playlist for a long time, and hearing a great live version of Calculation Theme on SomaFM. After listening to the album for a while, those are still the only two songs that I like on the album.Metric's problem on this album is that a lot of the songs are indistinguishable from one another, and they can't decide whether to be Interpol-style trashy nihilists or earnest anti-war rockers-with-a-conscience. However, those sins can be forgiven in the presence of great songs, but tracks like IOU, Succexxy and Combat Baby tend to blend together in an uninteresting mush.Part of my problem with this album was that I was listening to it after Funeral by The Arcade Fire, which is a very cohesive and powerful album, making Old World Underground pale in comparison."
2,Bah,"I first bought Old World Underground, Where are you Now? when I had heard the song Combat Baby from a friend. I loved it and I went to go buy the rest of the album.Little did I know that most of the album was pure filler. Very little relisten value.Tracks like Calculation (Theme) and IOU set the tone for the whole album and don't get me wrong, it's a unique tone. But it's not constant and it seems to drone on after awile.What really got me was the stupid metaphors. They try to sound unique when really the things they say are rediculous.2 stars.Corey."
3,An easy sell,"I bought the Old World Underground and Live it out CD's after I listening to a couple of songs on the local public radio, however I was somewhat disappointed as most of the songs sounds pretty much the same, not very inovative and quite not deserving the title of being an indie band - mainstream enough as some of the songs could easily pass as being from No Doubt. If Metric had come out on the mid 90's for sure their songs would be populating the radio charts back then.Said that, they do produce some fun music and have an amazing beat. You probably will enjoy if you do not have very high expectations"
2,Look at how HIP I am,"Electro-pop sucked in the 80's, but regurgitating it is so deliciously ironic... how could any ""indie"" band worth their salt resist?Of course if they wrote good songs or had some energy, it wouldn't matter what genre they fall in to. Search for a video of them covering Elliott Smith's ""Between the Bars"", watch the girl nodding off at the microphone, and try to tell me that this band is worth the attention they have been getting, especially in the Canadian music press.Retromantic tastemakers like Rolling Stone eat this up with a spoon, because it reminds them of old music which has been pre-digested and interpreted for them 100x over. If you are looking for music that pushes music forward, look elsewhere. If you want more boredom, check out Broken Social Scene."
5,"""Our falling bombs are her shooting stars""","This CD is incredible, to say the least. The opening track, ""IOU"" starts with a strong rocky opening, with some amazing lyrics. The songs just get better from there- just about all of these songs are stellar. Tracks 5 and 10 are probably the low points on the album, but even those are decent- they just lack the energy that the other songs on the album possess. In short, do yourself a favor, and buy this CD!"
3,I'm try to love Metric,I am attracted to the voice of the lead singer but there's a dark thread that permeates almost every song so it's tough to have on my playlist to listen to more than once every few months.
5,Metric delivers an album worth paying attention to,"""Old World Underground, Where Are you Now?"" is an exciting album with a style unlike anything else. It is an album which celebrates music and breathes new life into rock. I wouldn't hesitate a moment to purchase this album. From track one to ten the album is solid through and through. The vocals and keyboards of Emily Haines, the guitar of James Shaw and the drums of Joshua Winstead come together to form something wonderful. Paired with meaningful lyrics with some true substance, Metric is an aural delight. Metric's ""Old World Underground"" is an album worth paying attention to and definately worth purchasing!"
4,"And I thought I'd never like something with the word ""Metric"" in it!","I love it. I love it. I love it. Metric is dance-y and catchy and plain out incredible. But they also have a very indie characteristic to their songs. ""Dead Disco"" was the first song I heard, which I accidently stumbled across because my friend sent that in place of a song from the Veronica Mars Soundtrack (which is equally good, if not steps better). Nonetheless, after hearing ""Dead Disco"" what felt like a thousand times, I had to find the rest of the CD. Other good songs are ""Hustle Rose"", ""Succexy"", and ""Combat Baby"". It sounds a little trancelike dance-y, but with an element of rock. Sort of like a blend of everything, so everyone gets a little taste of their favorite flavor. All in all, this is a CD you should definately check out. It's uplifting and quite lyrically masterful."
4,fashion plate,"This is a new hip anglophile band that has gained a following in Los Angeles. They were once part of the Williamsburg scene, and they also lived and worked in Toronto and the UK. Live, lead singer Emily Haines is the focus and she has these three other guys with her. She looks like a deranged Chloe Sevingy and does manic dances onstage. Metric is a pop, punk, electronic exploration. Haines writes clever, somewhat nerdy, self-conscious lyrics. Metric is influenced by new wave and Britpop. They are much like Catatonia or Cinnamon, or any girl fronted band that starts with a C for that matter. Fans of their music tend to like ""Combat Baby"" and ""Dead Disco."" They even have an anti-war song called ""Succexy"" which doesn't go all the way. Like Roxy Music, they have a rotating bass player. In one song, Haines says she ""wants to paint it black."" You only wish she would go there to those dark places more often. Maybe she is only a fashion icon for the moment?"
4,just refreshing...,"interested in fresh music with good lirics, this is your cd...you can`t miss combat baby, succexy... just enjoy it ..."
3,"All the elements are there, why isn't this more interesting?","In an effort to be more helpful than the gushing great reviews, I have to say that, for all I thought this album was going to be (based on said reviews), it still disappointed me. The band is very capable, but the songwriting/structure falls flat. ""Succexy"" is the best track, but little else matches it in terms of quality."
3,Snort.,"Initially I loved this album, it has clever lyrics, and with the involvement with Broken Social Scene, whats not to love? I'll tell you: after an emotionless and motionless stage show by a twitchy, cracked-out lead singer, the album now gives me the creeps. I find it tasteless. But due to my initial love and dance a thon, I can't bear to give this album less than 3/5 stars. If a 2.5 existed, thats what it would get.It's not a bad album... just, a little bit overplayed, a little too simple, and frankly, now a litle boring. (but I still listen to it)"
3,"Fantastic, but a little too poppy","This Albums is a real kick in the pants. Totally energetic, wonderful, great, fantastic.Though I feel I must warn you, this poppy sounds do get old. Unfortunatley, this is not timeless album. I would recommend buying it, you can still get a good few months of listening and being blown away, before it starts to wear off."
3,not so much what i was looking for,"I was looking for a more ""this is what you need"" kind of book. Appeals to me as it is well written although the cylinder head section is a bit of a math class when one really wants to know is which head should one use.....some stock head designs are left out. Overall a good reader but would not buy again!"
1,Do NOT buy this CD,"They negelect to tell you that NONE of the songs on this album are by the original artists. It doesn't even say it on the CD, but they are definitely sung by other artists."
3,"Enjoyed it, but....","As far as psychological suspense novels go, this one was pretty good. The author hit the right notes in portraying parents that push and push their children to the extreme.However, what annoyed me while reading this book was the extreme amount of cursing and swearing the author's characters used. I can't believe that a 10 year old girl would swear as much as Ruby did. Brandon, yes, but Ruby - no. I'm not against using this language to bring out the personalities of the characters, but when every page brings a new f and s word, it gets a bit tiresome."
2,Unexciting,"This book, for me, did not live up to even its mediocre 3 -star average rating. The writing style is sophomoric, literally as though written by a high school student. The characters are unappealing: their personalities are less than engrossing, or just plain melodramatic and laughable. The plot is dull and utterly predicable, reminding me of a bad made-for-TV movie. I found it extremely difficult to remain interested in the story right from the beginning. I had to force myself to continue reading, hoping that it might improve as it went along, perhaps become more complex. It didn't. This book is rather tedious to say the least, but I slogged through, hoping for some engaging twist which never materialized."
2,It's been told before...,"This book was so-so. The storyline, about a psychotic stranger who enters a family in the guise of a friend and wrecks havoc, has been told before in movies and novels.I found the Gardners very annoying. The parents were complete self-centered idiots, the brother was obnoxious and the sister was weird. Some of her language and comments were very inconsistent with 11 year old girls. Also, what's the story with her being allowed to fend for herself most of the day and evening without any parental supervision?Skip it, or take it out from the library."
1,UNEDITED,This book reads like an unedited movie by ateenager. I expected a lot more from Abrahams.The author fails to build any character referenceand often jumps from reality to day dreaming.
4,A Romantic Journey,"Don't miss this lively and introspective look at a couples' changing relationship and a womans' journey to a fresh place in her life. This is no one-trick-pony of a novel. It has dimension and life, tension and mystery, heartbreak and romance. The female lead is an appealing, real woman who learns about herself and love and relationships in the beautiful Colorado landscape that the author draws very well. The colorful supporting characters are also really fun to get to know. This book is a terrific escape for any city dweller with a yearning to break free and live in the wild Rockies."
2,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"I hate giving bad reviews, but I love telling the truth. This book is full of techniques that any practicing Occultist will have mastered long ago. It's nothing new or interesting, nor anything particularly innovative. The only use I can find for this book is as a self-teaching tool for those with no experience in energy working. If you've worked energy succesfully before, just skip over this one and go for a more useful book."
4,Still Worth Reading,"I read this book again after long time and I still found this book really useful.This silver anniversary edition is an update of original version published more than 40 years now. Information about technology is dated as expected. But most of thoughts are connected with people issues and people were not changed much. Ignore old technology terms during reading or map them to something which is relevant today.He did not changed the original text, he left it as it was and added remarks (""wisdom of hindsight"" as he named it) after each chapter. I suggest to read them even before you read original chapter to clarify context."
2,I was disappointed,"I've read dozens of books in this area; I was disappointed with this book. A lot of the material is dated (and I'm not interested in learning PL/1 and JCL). The author has some interesting ideas, but not a lot of hard data (he does have some hard data, just not a lot of it). Peopleware and Mythical Man Month are a better books in this area. This book goes on my give-away list."
2,Got what I paid for,"This item is not very well made, and isn't all that pleasant to use. The hose is plastic, and not flexible enough. It also has such a small orifice that we feel like we can't get wet enough because it doesn't put out as much water as our old one. Great if you need to watch your water consumption, I guess. But when I take a shower, I want a SHOWER.Anyway, it looks nice but doesn't perform. I'll be returning it if I can."
1,DO NOT BUY!,This book has numerous! typos. There are so many that large sections must be skipped which results in losing the author's point. This is very disappointing that Amazon would sell such a thing!!!!
1,Horrible!,Not worth the money. Not as represented. Food products appear to be old and dried out...afraid to eat them. Non-food items are cheap and not something you would buy for yourself. Doesn't convey a thoughtful gift to the recipient.
2,"Over-priced for what you get inside, but the box is pretty.","I received this item as a birthday gift recently. The outer box with decoration and bow is lovely, and the outer wrappings of the items inside are nice. However, the actual items themselves were nothing really special for what this box cost (plus shipping!) 3 of the cookies were crumbled and all were on the dry side; the picture frame was NOT the nice gold-gilded victorian frame that is shown in the picture. Instead, I got a heart-shaped white cermanic frame (made in China). All in all, the outer wrappings & box out-did the actual items inside each wrapper. I would not have paid anymore than [...] for this item. Cannot believe it cost [...]!!!"
1,There are worse players,"It looks sturdy and was as expected for 2 days only. Now it won't even power up without an error message. This player has gotten normal reviews elsewhere, but my unit was flawed yet not worth sending back. You often get what you pay for. I bought a Creative Zen after, which works well."
1,Very disappointed,"We ordered this as a Christmas gift for our son. Thankfully we opened it so we could load music on it so he could use it right away. When we tried to load music, it would get stuck after every song. We would have to power it off and then try again. After 2 hours of trying we gave up and requested a refund!"
1,"By all means, skip this product!","The player was working fine when I got it for christmas, no problems except faulty battery life and a seperation with the internal and the memory card memory. Then, a random day came which something broke the inside of the head-phone jack, and now it only works in one phone, no matter what pair of head-phones I put inside it! It sucks! Yeah, the price is good, but literally this peice of crap is worth nothing, so it's still overpriced. You have a much better bet buying the Sony Walkman, probably."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"After couple days using, this device is not recognized any more when connected in the USB. I can not update the musics any more. It is impossible to obtain any support from the manufacturer - they just ignored my requests. My advise is: buy anything else."
4,You get what you ask,"This is a good device for the price.Of course the sound quality is not the same as in other more sophisticated players; but still is ok.For me the keys here were to use a AAA batterie, and to have expandable memory capacity (with the slot for SD Cards). I use this player when on the field, in long expeditions where I cannot have easy access to recharge energy. And to have the slot allow me to take a lot of music for the nights at the camp!I don't say anything about durability, because I just bought it. Probably it will not be too long, but I hope will be ok!"
1,loved it but broke too soon,Watch out for this one. I loved this player when i got it. Unfortunately about two weeks past the 90 day warranty the headphone jack broke. I was plugging in the headphones and the jack broke away inside the player leaving it totally useless. Cheaply made and now i know why they have a 90 day warranty.
3,"Works fine, except the battery door","The squareish form is a little annoying, but this device works just fine. The only problem is with the battery door, it simply won't stay close, probably a plastic defect.It does play fine and sounds fine otherwise."
2,Didn't last long,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter. It didn't last much longer than 30 days. Before this, however, it had good sound."
4,"An excellent work, but one small problem","This is an excellent volume. It is probably easier for a Calvinist to read than for others, but either way, the gospel shines clear. The one drawback is specific to this kindle version, and may only be a problem for scholars or students: the Greek characters do not come across accurately, and there is a lack of page numbers. besides that, you'll find this work to be helpful and encouraging as a Christian in the world today."
5,Over the Top Awesome!,This is a must read book. I wish I could memorize it! Kyper was a man deeply in love with God and thoroughly engaged with God's story to make all things new through Jesus. These lectures are gospel-saturated and offer the best of a Biblical worldview.
1,Really don't waste your time,"This small pamphlet had very few tie knots, three i think. And you can find better examples of them by serching on the Internet.Tiny, and not even worth the shipping."
5,Great Book!,"I am so glad this book came out. My husband can never tie his tie right, and I just have the time to teach him over and over and over. I bought this book for my husband and he loves it. He can do it all by himself now! Wooo HoooThanks,LiL' Tex"
4,Impressive Debut,"I took a risk on this cd without listening to it first and glad I took the chance. These guys are on tour with 3 Doors Down and Nickelback. I thought they would be similar in music style and they are to a certain extent. The thing that separates them from 3 Doors Down and Nickelback is the crunchy guitars and well written lyrics. I would categorize them in the U.P.O., Full Devil Jacket gang before 3 Doors Down and Nickelback.Highlights are ""Seed"", ""Poison"", ""Where The Freaks Go""."
5,Post Grunge Era Rock,"I bought this album after seeing this band play at Buzzfest. They played on a tiny stage with no lighting effects or fancy pyro. It was all them. They ripped the stage to shreds. I got to meet all the guys in the band and i got the cd signed. They even sold it to me for 8 bucks cuz i stayed to watch them. The album has a lot of depth to it and it has everything you would want from a post grunge era rock band. Moody acoustic songs close out the album and Powerful 3 note riffs easily hit you like a brick. If you like Alice in Chains or Nickelback or Tantric or Days of the New, THEN BUY THIS CD. Its the best thing to come out of Memphis since elvis. Peace out and listen to DFL.The Dude"
4,** Good n' Grungy **,"If you're a Alice in Chains fan you'll love this cd. ""Step Into the Light"" is by far the best track. 4 out of 5 star rating because I didn't care for a couple of the songs. Good grunge style music and excellent vocals. An overall good listen and definately worth purchasing. Enjoy it if you get it!!!!!"
5,"Awesome music, but the whole AIC comparison doesn't fit","This cd is an incredible one ... great great music. Haven't heard anything on them in a long while. Are the even around anymore. It would be a shame if they weren't. This is one of those cd's you put in the player and listen to it over and over and over. The whole AIC comparison doesn't fit though. I mean only the late great Staley and the reclusive mastermind Cantrell can do it like they do. And I would never go so far to say that DFL is better than AIC that is just down right heresy. However, that being said ... I do recommend this cd for those souls who like straight forward in your face rock..."
5,It's about time a great album comes out!,"Thanks to J4 for finally recording some great music. I agree with the reviewer that before me, that it's about time the music industry released an album that has substance and quality.Thanks to J4 for putting some integrity back into music.I rate this CD a 5 out of 5!Great band. Great CD!"
4,"I can see why ""Midnite"" is a radio single.","This totally impressed me. I listened to the songs on your web site, and can see why you guys are on the radio! I hope I can check out a show sometime. I'll back my words up now, and buy this!Heather"
2,Short lived,Worked well initially but eventually had trouble absorbing water when refilled. Finally had to toss due to significant mold growth and I had used only distilled water with each refill.
2,So-So!,I can't maintain 70% humidity in my humidor with this product it hovers between 55 and 60. I only have a small humidor I can't imagine having to use more than one to maintain 70% humidity. I guess it sort of works.
1,buy Heartfelt Humidity beads instead,"Three weeks and an inspection revealed mold starting to grow. Pulled it out, put in a HumiPillow to help for the next couple days, and sunk some money on some proper Heartfelt beads."
2,Disappointed,This humidifier gel did not humidify cigars in my cigar box. It also dried up and would not re-moisturize.
1,poor quality,These are obviously poor quality and are not recommended because they do not hold at a reasonably steady %RH. I also have the heartfelt beads and they are amazing.
4,A Bluegrass Great in His Most Productive Years,"This is not really a greatest hits album. Many of these recordings are Martin covering his own earlier material and that of others. That said, they are all well executed. The liner notes don't really track down who appears with him, but the stable at the studio where he cut these over a period of a couple of years included the stars of the Jamboree in Wheeling. Martin's voice is clear throughout, and his energy is unflagging. It's no substitute for the Bear Family set, but is a good addition to any bluegrass collection."
4,Not Exactly the Same s the Originals but Good Enough,"This isn't quite the same as having the original versions of Jimmy Martin's great songs, but if you didn't grow up on those, perhaps you'll like these just as much. Blue Moon of Kentucky, Don't Let Your Sweet Love Die, Freeborn Man, Rolling in my Sweet Baby's Arms, Truck Drivning Man and Little Pen are all legendary Bluegrass numbers. I wish this had Ocean of Diamonds on it, but everyone has their own idea of his greatest hits. It's too bad there isn't more of his work out there."
1,WORST,"TWO different sets, but defective out of the box....had many people try to get them to work (just in case I was being stupid) and NO ONE coukd get these to work consistently.AVOID at all costs."
1,Doesn't work half the time,I hooked up one of the monitors while my husband was remodeling a bedroom. Went to the store and came home and my 7 month old was hoarse from crying. The thing wasn't working. The other monitor doesn't work half the time either.
4,Cheap and VERY effective...Recommend for those on a budget,"Actually, I bought this to listen to my kids while they're napping (I have childcare). This works perfectly. I haven't tried the voice-activation feature, but the monitor picks up the kids' movements and even whispers (I have it on almost full volume). I also love the sounds and lights feature to be able to see things across the room. There is absolutely no static or problems with our set. I only paid twelve ninety-nine for our set and would do it all over again.However, if you're gonna pay more for a monitor, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Angelcare Bebe Sounds Sound and Movement Monitor. I just bought our second set to use for the playpen. Worth every penny...sound sleep and peace of mind is priceless!"
1,awful,"Well where to begin, it drained batteries, when the baby made a noise it would shut off and had tons of static. Not worth one penny. Unfortunatly it broke after the 30 days. POS"
3,"Decent gift, but not justified for the price.","Got this gift for my father, the boxing was cool. But the packages included were pretty generic. Two very small amount of packaged salmon and rest were crackers and spread. I could've spent that 60 dollars and bought salmon at Sam's Club and smoked it ourselves with 10x the amount of salmon.Overall, the gift box was nice and could be reuse for other purposes, but the overall food package was disappointing. I expected more out of a gift basket such as this. Should be called crackers and fish spread gourmet food gift box, salmon was more like a side."
2,Old Test Strips,"I received 2 packages of test strips on April 26, 2004 and they expired on May 1st, 2004. I immediately returned them and requested replacements. However, they gave me a refund instead so I would assume they have a boatload of these sitting around in a warehouse which they are trying to get rid of."
2,Don't throw out your strips!!!!,"Okay this works for me and do not recommend it for you. The strips will never register outdated if the meter is re-programmed for an earlier date!! My strips were a month or two older than the expiration so I re-programmed the date one year earlier. This company, Lifestream, I've found to be extremely dishonest!!. I sent in a $30.00 rebate and although it was approved they refused to send the money!. Finally I prepared a Court Summons and faxed it to them, and received my rebate within a week!! Beware big time with these people"
3,TEST STRIPS WORK,"Yes, these are expensive, but it does the job. You just got to make sure you bleed enough.. OUch!"
5,Rival GRF405 Fold-n-Store Griddle,"Very good product; easy to clean; once it heats up (about 10-15 minutes), it cooks very evenly between the two sides; enough space to cook on; I like that it folds up and protects the griddle plates so they don't get scratched; highly recommend this product."
5,Read previous reviews and decided to buy. Good overall deal. Easy to clean and to cook on. Nice griddle.,"Read previous reviews and decided to buy. Good over all deal. Easy to clean and to cook on. Nice griddle.3/15/11-not so nice...the right side is now warped from the heat. Will contact the company. The seam in the middle is a pain in the butt, especially if you are cooking something that is really runny like scrambled eggs! Pick another griddle!"
3,Rival foldable griddle,It is a nice and handy product to have and it works well enough to consider it acceptable. One advantage of it is that it folds and does not require too much storage place. I can not rave about it like other reviewers did since I can compare with another one I still have (but getting too old) a Wolfgang Puck Griddle and it does not even come close in performance. The claimed non stick surfaces of this griddle stick pretty badly when making pancakes. I probably will wind up getting another one of the Wolfgang Puck griddle which is not foldable but miles ahead in performance of this unit.
4,What's Cokken'?,"We've waited to give feedback for nearly a full year so that we could use it and not give an out-of-the-box WOW, or a one-experience-Dud review.To date this griddle has worked very well and we have been pleased with its performance. Though we have not used it for heavy duty cooking, as it is usually myself and my wife, everything we have used it for gets cooked evenly and, so far, clean up has been easy and the nonstick surface has not deteiorated.Over all we would say it is excellent for medium level use we put it to.The reason I give it only 4 stars has to do w/ the grill plates being a bit thin. Due to this they don't store a lot of heat, however they Recover Very Quickly, without producing hot spots. An important aspect so you don't end up w/ half the food burned and half under cooked."
1,not pleased,I didn't get the item that I had ordered the company sent me a water hose. I had to call and e-mail them 5 times before I got any help. Then they told me that the item was out and they didn't sale them. It would take them 3 to 4 weeks to refund my money.I was very upset with this because I had purchased it for a Christmas gift. I don't see how you can pack a water hose in place of a griddle.
5,Love it!,"I used this griddle all of the time. I bought my mother-in-law one for Christmas because they have a camper. We just bought a camper, so I had to buy a second one to use for it! It's a great product and everything comes out evenly cooked!"
2,This movie is on the weak side!,"I was so excited to buy this movie because I love Cuba and Kamar De Los Reyes. However, the movie was so slow and didn't have an exciting storyline. I bought this DVD 2 years ago and to this day, I haven't completed watching it. Not worth the money!"
2,not really helpful,the exam has more complex questions than the book prepares you for science section and vocabulary was lacking
2,Great review information,"This book contains great information on reviewing in Science, Math, and Verbal Ability"
2,not very helpful,"I devoured this book from front to back and I only scored 115. Although it gives you some review in each area covered on the exam, none of the vocabulary was what was on the test. Don't count on this as your only source. Check out a couple other review books, and good luck.Kathy"
2,RN2B--hopefully one day,"I only rated this book 2 stars because I feel like it wasn't as helpful as I had anticipated. The math portion was good--the practice questions were VERY similar to what was on the test. The verbal part--maybe it's helpful if you're a slow reader and need to just ""pracice"" reading passages. The vocabulary on the real test didn't even compare to what was in the book. The science helped some to refresh what I had already taken in school. But it didn't cover enough re: electricy and ohms and stuff like that. A lot of questions on my test were about electricity. I felt as if I needed to take a course in that alone to be able to pass the science portion. I took the test a couple of days ago so maybe once I receive my scores I will have a different opinion. Right now, though, I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this book."
1,okay book but did not help with the test,I study the book from front to back and the pretest was nothing like the test. the test had nothing to do with nursing but I did recieve the book in a very timely manner and I was pleased with Amazon.com
1,"Don't buy it, does not help to pass the test",I purchased this book because the RN school said it was the best study guide. 90% of the material on the test is not even discussed anywhere in the study guide. I studied that guide thoroughly and took all of the tests and was surprised to find that only about 10% of it was actually on the test. This book does not help at all!! Not worth your money.
4,Parallel Mysteries,"The folks in Delphi South Dakota are planning a big high school reunion and reminiscing about the past. One of the things they are remembering is the death of Butchie Pendergast in 1969 at a kegger party by the river following the Homecoming celebrations. At the time, it was assumed to be a drowning accident. But was it? Twenty years later history seems to be repeating itself and Tory Bauer wants to know the truth. Along with a good mystery, told with humor and suspense, there are some good life lessons served up in this one. I've read three Tory Bauer mysteries now, and every one of them is a winner."
5,Awesome!,"I can tell I really like a book when I don't want to put it down at night, when I almost miss my train stop because I am too engrossed and when my husband talks to me and I don't hear him because I am reading. All of her books do that for me. They are AWESOME!"
4,Good local color,"Much fun. I graduated from an Iowa small town school well before the 1969 of this book, but it was (is) all familiar. She has the setting right; I particularly liked the discription of the men following the football up and down the sidelines.Liked it enough to look up her others and order them tonite"
4,Murder?,"I don't want to give away the ending, but it seems that Ms. Taylor likes her characters (""nothing like"" those in her home town, according to the author's bio) too much to let anyone be too guilty - only the dead really deserve punishment. As you can see, reviewers either love or hate the series. Perhaps the real dividing line on the reviews is whether the reviewer has relatives from the upper Midwest. Yes, each book is one long piece of gossip, but that's what gives it local color and makes it seem authentic. Frankly, I feel I know Delphi better than Harrold because of this series."
4,French Story of Mankind,"Pierre Henri Cami (1884-1958) was a French author famous for his pastiches of Sherlock Holmes, Alexandre Dumas and Baron Munchhausen. Note for his cariacatures, he drew the cover illustration for this book. He was a founder of the French Academy of Humor and he won the International Grand Prize for Humor in 1953. Charlie Chaplin called him the greatest humorist in the world. This novel seems to be a comic send up of the story of man's fall with lots of references to God and Lucifer. French text. 301 pages."
1,"Don't bother with this version, buy the original","Oh god, where to start. This version doesn't even compare to the original 2003 film. The original had heaps more content, actors that better fitted the parts, better costuming and magic. I found this version boring and it didn't do a good job of telling the story - probably partly due to the fact that half of the story seemed to be removed. Why would you bother to re-make such a great movie when you aren't even going to come close to the original? Spare yourself and buy this orginal instead:Wide Sargasso Sea"
2,Not at all as good as the book...,"Wide Sargasso Sea is one of the best books I've ever read, but the movie does not even compare. In fact, if you haven't read the novel, I think this film would be really confusing because key parts are left out. I cannot believe that there is no filming of Antoinette's childhood, or the plantation fire, or her time in the convent. All of this is left out - the only mention of it is when Antoinette is telling the story to Rochester. During this narration, it seems as if the film is just BEGGING to have a flashback showing the action of what she is saying, but nothing. The ending is also really confusing - again, unless you have read the book you probably will not understand what is happening. The only thing I liked about this film was the actress playing Antoinette, which is why I gave the film two stars intead of one."
2,STRANGE,"This prequel is going to disappoint most Jane Eyre devotees. It is much more like a badly written romantic novel than a classic. If you must see it, check it out from your local library. I'm glad I did that rather than buy it as I found it to have more sex than substance and thought it overall....VERY STRANGE and not very entertaining."
2,Don't Sea,"I was so interested in a Jane Eyre ""pre-quill"" with hopes it that would really flesh out Mr. Rochester's early attraction to his Island wife. While the setting was lush, Mr. Rochester remained unlikeable, the barefoot Islanders sneaking in and out were randomly weird/ominous/friendly/........nothing - not even the steamy scenes - really put it all together. Big wide disappointment."
5,3 vocalist = a damn good cd,"you can't go wrong with this one- the layering of vocals alone is a good reason to buy it. Plus, it has a mix of ballads and songs that make you want to get up and dance. don't hesitate buy it right now. Support the artist that work hard and really deserve it."
5,go get it now...,"The boys of midtown are truly amazing musicians, and Save the World, Lose the Girl is no exception. The songs are polished, catchy, and the lyrics are heartfelt and honest. Personally, ""No Place Feels Like Home"" is the best song on the album, but there is no song that should get skipped over. This album is perfect for the music fan that likes the blend of different styles of music - punk and rock are both represented. They can go fast, with amazing guitar rifts, and slow with harmonic melodies. I recommend this album heavily, go get it now! These boys will be mainstream before long, mark my words."
5,Best Album of New Millenium,"This is one of, if not the greatest album I have ever heard. Every song is packed with emotion and is catchy. One of the few albums that I can listen to start to finish and then over again. I really can't put into words how good it is. Only listening to it can truly do it justice."
5,Midtown-Nj PUNK ROCK,"Theres no word that can describe the Music of Midtown. These four boys just rock.Ive been going to midtown shows since 1999, and at every show, their fan base just keeps growing. This CD is AWESOME. The minute i heard ""just rock and roll"", i knew how great this album was going to be. I couldnt stop listening to it. THEY SIMPLY ROCK. GET THIS ABLUM NOW! And if you havent caught any of their shows, get off your as and go see them live!!"
5,EVERY OTHER BAND ON THE PLANET SHOULD JUST GIVE UP...,"I got a CD sampler with two songs by Midtown and A New Found Glory at a Saves The Day show a while back. Both bands were awesome, so when I found out they were playing together, I had to go to the show. I cannot believe how incredibly powerful, energetic and heart-felt both bands are. I've never been so blown away at a show before in my life! I bought the Midtown CD a the show, and I was equally impressed. It was produced by the same guy who did Jimmy Eat World, Blink and The Hippos--all amazing sounding records. Anyway, I'm excited to have discovered a new band that rocks beyond belief and has something relevant and thought-provoking to say. I almost died when I heard the three singers singing together at the end of ""Come On."" If you like JIMMY EAT WORLD, THE ATARIS, SAVES THE DAY, LAGWAGON and A NEW FOUND GLORY you will flip over this record. Every single song is great. Midtown rule!"
2,Don't buy this CD...,"I got this CD after reading all of the positive amazon reviews on here, and being a fan of punk-pop/emo bands was really excited to listen to save the world lose the girl. But once I got it I was totally dissapointed. Yes, the boys of midtown are really cute, and there are a few good songs (my favorite would be direction), but honestly, the rest of the songs are totally boring, unoriginal, and not even catchy. Forget Midtown's lame lyrics, and try listening to Saves the Day, the Get Up Kids, or the Ataris."
3,Not what i expected,"I bought this cd thinking it would be really good, especially from all the reviews i read on this website. But its really not... i bought it mostly cause i loved the songs i dowloaded off mp3.com (no place feels like home, knew it all along, just rock n roll) those are really good songs...but probably the ONLY good ones on the cd. I thought ""another boy"" was gonna be this cool pure punk song from the sample i heard... but thats all the WHOLE song is, a sample. its like 40 seconds long i was extremely disappointed. before you buy this cd borrow it from someone or buy a used one or something."
3,"nothing really wrong, just nothing that spectacular","After hearing a lot about this album, many likening it to the Get Up Kids' ""Something to write home about"", I was expecting a lot more than i got. first of all, to compare anything to the aforementioned album is to set it up for dissapointment if it is anything but musical enlightenment. Needless to say, that was my expirience. The lyrics are shallow and a bit cliche, while the chords, changes, form, and musical structure don't deviate from the punk standards that have been severely beaten into the ground. If you want to hear yet another punk band with purely consonant harmony and melody, a guy with a scoopy nasal voice, purely triadic chords, and a subdivided drum line on the beat, than by all means... they do that well. But as far as ingenuity, originality, and creativity go, to say this album would be lacking would a understatement reminiscent of the degree of overstatements found in pretty much all the reviews here."
2,How to ruin a special gift.,"I bought this product as a special gift for a 15 year girl. I understood it would be sent by a third company so you could not gift wrap it. So I asked at least not to send the price. You recommended me to write directly to the manufacturer which I did, but I never got a response. The result... my gift arrived late, she never knew who had sent it, it was not wrappped, and had a price tag NICELY attached..."
1,The really bad stuff again.,"There must be dozens of CDs around with Bill Haley's recordings from the late 60s. They are awful, to say the least. Watch out, Rock'n'Roll fans, these are not Bill's original hits from the 50s."
1,"This one is useless, too","I bought the larger Victor M260 as well as this smaller M2524 and the smallest Victor electronic trap, the M250. I wrote a longer review on the M260 (mouse hotel), but both of the smaller units have had precisely the same success. Installed in two separate locations where spring traps have been catching mice regularly, we have not caught a single mouse in any of the 3 electronic traps.Don't wast your money. I regret this purchase."
5,Quick and Easy,If you do as the instructions say you will not have a mouse problem very long and its humane and clean.
4,Good,"Worked REALLY well. After the first kill though, not to sure, it made a buzzing sound. Not sure if I cleaned it wrong or if its normal. Will see when I have another mouse problem."
2,Not happy,"The first one I purchased did not work so I contacted Victor and they did replace mine with a new one. I received the new one, however, it too now has problems and is not killing mice, as advertised. I could understand receving one defective product, but, two is not likely. The second one blinks green, hums ...meaning loads, but when I return later to check it it's blinking red. Yes, It have new batteries, and yes there is evidence that mice have been there because their are droppings and peanut butter is gone. I can not recommend this product at this time."
5,Great product!,"I have used these mouse traps for years. The only criticism I have is that it really doesn't last much more than 1 1/2 to 2 years. But it works quickly, is easy to empty, & seems the best approach I have found."
5,The only mousetrap you'll ever need!!!,"This trap works like gangbusters!!! The only other thing I've found that works nearly as well is the glue trap but to be honest, I've watched several mice wriggle free from a glue trap and then scamper away. There is no getting out of this trap alive though. This thing is the best mouse trap out there."
4,Mouse Away,"Sometimes the trap will have a mouse and the light does not go on, but it does catch the mice."
1,Item does not work.,"I purchased this item, set it up one night. In the morning all the peanut butter was gone but no mouse was in the container. When I set it, the light had gone on for a brief second like the instructions said it should. When I cleaned everything up and attempted to reset it, the light wouldn't even come on. I tried putting in another set of batteries and that didn't help either. I have tried to return it and I cannot even do that. I would like an address to return it to you but I can't seem to get one. I would not recommend this product."
3,No mice yet,To date I haven't caught a mouse in this trap. So it's hard to judge it. The first night I set it out along with two d-Con traps and immediately caught a mouse in one of those. Hard to think there is only one single mouse in a place but don't know for sure. I still am leaving this trap down and hoping if there are any more of the little critters in the house they will find their way to it and be gone. It appears to be well made and easy to set up. After reading other comments I started out with a very small amount of peanut butter. Since then have checked and have added a tiny bit more to see if that will attract them - so far nothing yet.
2,Smart mice or ineffective product?,"I bought this mouse trap because of the high ratings, but I am not completely satisfied with it. I returned one because it was defective, the other one has yet to prove its use. I don't know if it is because our population of mice is incredibly smart and knows to avoid traps, or if this trap is ineffective. We followed the suggestions and placed a small amount of peanut butter at the end of this contraption but we have yet to trap anything."
2,Only for dumb tiny mice,"I bought one of these with no luck. My thought was that I just needed more in mulitple locations. So, I spent about $100 for about 5 more of these. I put them out using peanut butter and left them out in mulitple locations with no luck. All I got was a little mouse laughing at me as he went scurring around. I actually have video of a mouse running in and out of one of these. So, I spent another $10 on about 5 regular old wooden spring traps. The $2 spring trap caught him within 2 days. Don't waste your money on this."
3,inconclusive,I bought the mouse traps and I haven't seen a mouse! But the traps haven't killed any either! I may have killed them all by conventional means. I guess I will have to wait for an other infestation to try it out.
4,Peanut butter is THE perfect companion of this trap,"Don't over bait, only a tad peanut butter is sufficient.Be patient, this took us two weeks to catch the tiny rat, but it works great!The best bait is still peanut butter~speaking from experience, we tried a lot of different food...Overall, at the very moment we are considering return the product, it catches the rat. The only reason I gave a 4-start is that there was no green light blinking for victory...it took me by surprise. should have checked the door for tail. :)"
1,Snack Bar for Mice,"I bought two of these, and neither of them worked. I followed the directions and the reviewers directions carefully (i.e. no food bate on plate etc)and even went out and bought new batteries in case that was the problem. Although the peanut butter was completely gone each night, so were the mice! They simply came in, got the food and left. This product is great if you are a hungry mouse who doesn't really want to work for food--not so great if you are a human who does not want to live with rodents and does not want to get ripped off by the Victor Electronic Mouse Trap Company."
3,Mixed feelings,"We bought one at first based on the reviews (and we read them all!) we found on Amazon. And we caught three mice in the first two days. We were so excited, we went and bought another one immediately, but that is when things came to a grinding halt. We changed the batteries, we cleaned the traps, we made sure to be careful when baiting the traps, we made sure all the lids were properly closed, etc. Nothing in two weeks, but we can still find mouse droppings here and there and the peanut butter inside the traps has been eaten every time. One trap worked for three mice and the brand new one does not work.Don't know what to think. Maybe the product is shoddily made, as mentioned in other reviews. The question is, should we keep trying (and keep feeding the mice for nothing), or give up?We bought a Rat Zapper Ultra and will give that a try, but we have mixed opinions on this mouse trap."
2,stops working,"I have purchased three of these Victor Electronic mouse traps over the last three years. I have recommended them to friends and relatives. When they are working they were great, and got the job done.The problem is, none of my mouse traps are currently working. The first two failed within a year due to faulty engineering of the plastic compartment door hinges. It is poorly designed and if the flimsy hinge breaks then the compartment door will not close correctly and thus a trip switch activating the trap will not work. This has happened on the first two traps purchased by me within the first year. My third trap just quit working, I changed the batteries to no avail, something was electronically wrong.I did not abuse these traps and the batteries were always checked. For the price you pay for these traps you would expect a longer life and a better design."
2,Really dissapointed,"I have mice coming and going out of my garage. I noticed a lot of feces so I put one of these out. Put the peanut butter in it, which I had to change every few days because it would get crusty, turned it on. Nothing. No mice. Its been 2 months and yesterday I found a dead mouse that I ran over with my car, in the garage. Not in the trap but 20 ft away, nowhere near the trap. I'm a little disappointed because I followed the directions accurately and with 200+ 5 star reviews, I thought it would work."
4,Victor Electronic Mouse Trap,"I had bought one of these about 4 years ago. Worked like a charm. Had to buy another trap because I couldn't find the old one when a new mouse showed up.Set it all up. During the night, a buzzing sound started coming from it. Turned it off and waited until the morning. I ended up killing a house centepede. It was huge! lol.I think I might have used too much peanut butter. I'll have to reset it with less peanut butter on it."
2,failed in 4 days,"The idea may work but the one I received failed in 4 days without trapping any mice. The failure mode was that the light would not flash when the switch was turned on even with new, tested, batteries."
1,Money Trap,Don't waste your time (or money - see review title) on this trap - first one arrived from Amazon DOA and the batteries would warm up - a wiring short. Replaced by amazon super fast. The next trap arrived in working condition. Bait applied sparingly per instructions. A week later bait was gone and batteries dead. Going to look into other options.
1,not able to use,"First I have no complaints about the shipper, it arrived well before anticipated delivery date so they get 5 stars.The product itself gets minus 5 stars. I put the batteries in turned it on no green light flashed. Took the batteries out thinking I put them in wrong and they were very warm. Put them back in turned it on same thing. Turned the unit off and maybe 10 minutes later the unit was very warm, took the batteries out and not only were they hot but the casing was peeling off (duracell batteries).So obviously I'm sending the unit back. I'm sure it was just a defective unit but it shouldn't be defective. I wanted to zap the mouse in my house not create a fire trap."
2,I'm not liking these traps so far...,"I have had these traps for 2 weeks. I baited them with peanut butter slathered on the back wall. I placed them in high traffic areas. I have not caught a single mouse. In fact, I can see where the mouse reached in through the tiny holes to lick all the PB is could reach without entering the door. However, these mice are crafty. I used old school mouse traps and they managed to eat the PB right off of them without setting them off. BASTARDS! It's a neverending battle. I still have these traps baited and in place. We'll see if they work eventually..."
2,Product did not work,"Sorry, but for me, this product did not work. I even used gloves to put the peanut butter in the trap, and batteries, and no mice. Maybe perhaps because the mice are below in the crawl space, and I put this trap up in the pantry where they had gone before a few years ago. At any rate, this trap did not work for me in the pantry. And again, part of this reason could be because the mice are confined in the crawl space."
1,Mice didn't go in - small opening seemed to make mice wary,"Never caught a sincle mouse with this model from Victor -- I believe the small opening seemed suspicious to them and they stayed away. (Mechanical traps with small openings also don't work -- no mice in them either.)I replaced it with one of Victor's electronic rat traps that has a much bigger opening (to a mouse, it seems like a cavern), and started catching mice immediately -- until it broke after 6-10 mice. The replacement also stopped working after about the same number of mice. (See my review on those.)"
1,NON WORKING PRODUCT WASTE OF MONEY,"DID NOT WORK AS STATED LITE DID COME ON AS STATED MOUSE DIED,BUT MADE A MESS AND HAD TO THROW OUT. WASTE OF MONEY. PURCHASED BEFORE WITH NO PROBLEMS THIS DESIGN NOT AS GOOD."
1,electronic mouse trap,"Absolutely useless.Have not caught a mouse in 2 weeks, yet I have numerous in the tack room.They run all over it but do NOT go in it!They ""perform"" on it and despite the aroma of peanut butter they do not enter.I am going to try and return it."
2,The Green Mile for Mice,"We have one. It works OK, but after I saw The Green Mile all I could think of was poor little Mr. Jingles going to the electric chair in a strange twist to the movie.For some reason mice are very hesitant to enter the trap especially after one mouse has been fried in it. Victorized. Maybe they sense the electronic field or the ghosts of other mice. We catch many more mice with the Ortho traps and they are disposable. This one is expensive and hard to clean.I like the gift wrap option. The perfect gift for a masochist.Mousochist?"
1,doesn't work!!,"OK, I have not caught one single mouse with this thing. I checked batteries and they work. I've tried different types of bait, like peanut butter, cheese, pretzel, and another store bought bait for mice and no success. Its very tiny as well and they'd have to be small mice to even get in there. Waste of money!!"
3,Trap,"The directions are difficult for an older/elderly person to follow, I am not sure of how the product actually works, since my grandmother has not been able to follow the directions."
5,electric mouse trap,4 kills in four days...no mess...works like a charm. I won't go back to the old school mouse trap for anything.
1,"sorry, mine didn't work","got one rat trap and one mouse trap. both would light green for about 10 seconds and then deliver a shock to a non-existent mouse (or rat) and then shut offdidn't bother to return them, bought old fashioned kind which worked fine"
5,It works.,"We recently purchased an old house in a rural area that gets real cold in the winter months, and have discovered that this equation equals the occasional mouse, no matter how tight you think you have your place sealed up. If you're serious - and seriously squeamish - about getting rid of these unwanted tenants, this trap is your new best friend. Put a teeny dab of peanut butter on the side wall, turn it on, place it near the ""scene of the crime"", and the next morning you'll have a blinking green light and a slightly heavier trap waiting for you. The product does what it says it will do, with neither muss nor fuss for the homeowner and at the very least seemingly no prolonged suffering for the mouse. While the pricetag seems a bit daunting at first, I figure I paid twenty bucks and then some for a wide variety of unhelpful gadgets that essentially served as feeding stations and port-a-potties for our little guests. This one gets the job done, quickly and efficiently."
4,Mice are gone...,Mouse trap worked just as I expected. I like it much better than the mechanical ones. Be careful to clean up leftover peanut butter as it can conduct across the bottom plates and use up the battery charge.
1,Wasting your money...,"Good old fashion traps seems to work the best. I have had this Victor Electronic Mouse Trap for 3 months now, and haven't caught one rodent in it. I even looked online to make sure I have everything set up correctly.Yes, the old fashion traps are pretty disgusting. I HATE dealing with dead things... But, if you throw a puppy pad under the trap, you don't have to really look at it, touch it, or even clean up anything. They're quick and get the job done.Don't waste you money like I did!!!"
5,The Better Mousetrap,The trap is easy to use and worth every penny. Am considering buying several more for the garage. I store my wood there and it is easy for field mice to get in.
5,"First house, first mouse!","I knew the day would come having a dog door and leaving the garage door open while I run in groceries....I figured it's about time we got our first mouse. After finding my tortillas chewed up on the kitchen counter I knew I had a problem. I read reviews on the Home Depot site and decided to get this one. I wanted the mouse to have a quick death. I didn't want the spring traps because I would feel awful if it didn't work right and had to deal with hours of pain...so I followed the directions and this worked great. An hour later, I see the tail poking out the back. Rest in peace little mouse. I placed it in my basement too because I figured where there's one mouse there are probably more."
1,Works but dies after one use or doesnt work out of box try something else,"We tried this and it did kill it, but the thing died too. We got one before dead out of box, then the one that worked for one mouse. Now for the price it should have worked longer. They are small field mice too!"
5,EXCELLENT!,We are in inundated with mice both in our horse barn and basement. I received my electronic mousetrap for my barn yesterday and within three hours we took out six dead mice. Needless to say - I just ordered THREE more mousetraps. These are the best I have ever used - even better than our BARN CATS!
1,Electronic Mouse Trap DOES NOT work!!,"We bought this after reading the box, & what a JOKE! First of all, it came with batteries that were dead, so we had to go buy 4 AA batteries. We hooked the batteries up, baited the trap with peanut butter & the next morning, the mice had cleaned up the peanut butter, but no dead mice! This went on for 3 days straight, the mice just eating the peanut butter but not getting killed. So we've basically been FEEDING the dang mice instead of killing them. We bought 4 of the no-touch mouse traps & have caught 8 dead mice in the past 2 days! We are taking this piece of junk back to Lowe's and getting our $20 back. Just buy the no-touch kind of traps & you'll be much better off!"
1,Worked once...,I put it down and it caught a mouse the first day. After that however it seems that it just stopped working...
1,The mice are smarter than the trap,"Caught two mice the first night I deployed the trap, one after the other. The next night, the unit started making a high-pitched buzzing noise and the bait was stolen. Since then, the bait is untouched and no mice have been caught. I think they avoid it entirely. BTW, I am not the only one who thinks I still have mice. So does my cat. She has caught one so far."
1,humane my ass,"I bought this product because it was supposed to be effective and humane... I want the mice out but I'm not a sadist! I struggled with the batteries, 6 sets, and then hooray, blinking light success! Set the thing with PB and waited. Caught a mouse the first night but it wasn't dead, it was lying there twitching.. now my karma is screwed and this thing is crap! If I wasn't looking for humane I'd be a total douche and just use a glue trap.. I'm going for a catch and release trap now because anything has got to be better than this.. only buy this product if you don't really give a flying fig about humane and are thinking this is PC!"
1,waste,"mice wont even go in the thing. its been out for weeks, i still hear the rats though. i put peanut butter in it, that didnt work, so i tried cheese, that didnt work either. idk what else to do"
2,The trap mice won't go in.,Looks good but has not caught a mouse yet. Who knows if it works. I had to go to poison to solve our problem.
3,I prefer the Rat Zapper,"This trap works ok. The issue I have with it is that there's no way to determine if there's a mouse in the trap without opening it up. I caught one mouse and it was slightly difficult to get it out because of some small blood binding the mouse to the trap. I prefer to spend a little more money to get the Rat Zapper.One tip I have is to use a dry bait like a small piece of a granola bar or dog/cat food. It's easier to clean, won't get mold, etc."
2,Disappointed,"I bought two and waited with anticipation. I checked everyday to see if I had a light to signal I had a mouse. Finally by day four with no light lit I decided to move one of the traps. When I picked the trap up it was heavier. I sheepishly opened it. Yuck, yuck no way was I dealing with that. It must have caught and killed a mouse the first day. I had a friend that said they would clean it for me but it even made her too creeped out. I won't give details because I didn't look closely but if someone else doesn't even want to clean it...I threw it out, that was costly.I was looking forward to finally finding a trap that I could handle dealing disposing of the mice. The other trap I still haven't caught anything. I have learned to open and check it daily. The concept is great, I liked the idea that a light would alert me to a catch but since that didn't work I ended up being back in the boat of having to look for a dead mouse again."
1,Has never caught anything,"I bought this trap based on the user pictures which showed mice with four inch body lengths in the trap. However, this trap has never caught any rodents. Meanwhile, theAgri Zap RZU001 Rat Zapper UltraI bought at the same time regularly catches mice (usually only two inches long) using the same bait (peanut butter, nuts). I am guessing this is because the of the twisty windy tunnel of this model - I know I wouldn't want to squeeze through that. The other trap is just a big empty box, looks harmless."
3,Not sure if it works or not.,"I know I had a mouse in the kitchen because I saw it, my son saw it and there were mouse droppings under the sink. Most people say, where there is one mouse, there are more. So, assumed I would catch a mouse. It's been 4 days...nothing! To be fair, I also put out baits...but saw droppings for two days after and that's why I added the trap. Since then, droppings have disappeared and no mouse has been caught! Hhmmm! I am not sure if I had one lone mouse or if the trap just doesn't work. I used a very small amount of peanut butter on the back wall as suggested, but no mouse. I think I will buy an ortho disposable and try it. They worked in my garage...two mice in two days. The only reason I didn't use them this time was I was expecting a war (more than one mouse) and it can get costly replacing the ortho traps! But, I will try one in my kitchen here and if it works, the Victor is no good. If not, I may sound an all-clear! :) I will let ya know the outcome!"
3,Victor electronic mouse trap,These traps wor great. We use them in our motor home while in storage. I little dab of peanut butter is all you need to get rid of the pests.
1,Mice really really hate moth balls!,"Moth balls seem to be the only thing that work for single people without kids or pets (moth balls are toxic to them). Using peanut butter baited mouse traps are not repelling mice, but attracting them. I'd rather repel them in the first place."
5,THIS IS WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD,"Wow! Wow! Wow! It took several days to work, but this is a godsend!!!The mice had been taking over and making my life miserable.I can't keep a cat because we're allergic and it would also go after the birds.Glue traps caught a few careless ones, but they wised up to that, and it was a cruel way to die.Poison only killed a few as well, but again, they got smart to that too.They had a constant source of food because they were climbing into the birds' cages and eating their seed, and I just couldn't stop them.However, once they started coming into the trap, it's been mousey heaven! Literally. 5 down in 24 hours. Bye-bye!So nice to be talking about them in the past tense :-)"
3,Smaller than expected but should still work,"I don't know how the really big field mice that I see outside my house would ever fit into one of these things. I suppose it is possible, knowing that they can squeeze into tight spots, but the thing is so light it would probably just end up moving it around and giving up.It's also very cheap. It came with one of the plastic hinges for the door broken, a tiny tiny piece of plastic. I suppose these things shouldn't need to last that long if they're successful anyway.So far, no mice, but will update this review if it catches one."
2,Stick with the classic mousetrap,Hasn't caught a single mouse. Use it according to directions with no luck. The traditional mousetraps I left around have all caught mice however.
5,Very effective,"I've had one of these traps for about 6 months, and I just got three more this weekend. I've tried four different kinds of traps: this one, the old-style snap trap, a new-style snap trap that looks like a big clothes pin, and a tilting no-kill trap with a gravity-closed door, and this is the only design that has ever caught a mouse. The first one I bought has racked up seven kills sitting within two feet of two snap traps that have scored zero in that same time. The three new ones have three total kills in their first two days.Bait with a little peanut butter, then place it alongside a wall. Mice like to stay close to walls for safety as they travel around, so you do a lot better up next to a wall than out in the open. Yes, the trap is a little pricey, but it gets results. I wish I had not wasted money on all the other kinds of cheaper traps first."
5,Great Mouse Trap,"Suspected a mouse...bought this trap....added the peanut butter, turned it on....next morning....got em'.....works great! Easy disposal!"
3,Better Mouse Trap?,"Well, I set this electronic mouse trap up in a closet that has seen much mouse activity. I put peanut butter in as a lure. However, the only animal it has attracted so far is my dog. He loves peanut butter. It's been in place two weeks and has not caught a mouse. I think I'll change my lure and give it another week."
4,Effective,"Baited and placed the trap as directed (in the path and along a wall where the mouse was spotted). The next morning the light was flashing and the trap contained the dead mouse.Pros:Easy to set-upNo half dead or semi poisoned mouse to deal with.Easy to dispose of the dead mouse.Easily visible blinking light when trap has been triggered.Cons:Battery installation could be clearer.Cleaning bait from trap for storage can be a bit of a pain.Overall a 5 star trap, best one I've used to date."
5,Kinder than a snap trap,Works very well - might buy another one! I disliked cleaning out the live traps (although they worked well too).
2,Electronic Mouse Trap,No mouse came near it but it did execute a few snails. Ended up throwing it away and having to use the old fashioned mouse traps which did work :-(
1,Has not caught a single mouse,"Tried various kinds of bait - peanut butter, cat food, etc. The mice just don't go in it. The only traps that have been effective are the old-school, cheap traps that are $5 for 4 at your local hardware store."
2,"1 worked, 1 didn't","Unfortunately I didn't open the boxes and try these out until after Amazon's expiration for returns -- so I'm stuck with one inop unit. New batteries, double checked - per another reviewer I'll try a different set of batts but don't expect it to work (will update this review if it does.)The one that worked worked perfectly. The one that didn't never did light the green light.So, word to the wise - check these out immediately after receiving and make sure it's operable. Then follow the instructions on the top reviewer's review about no foreign matter, use small amounts of p-butter, etc.p"
2,"Faulty, poorly designed...needs improvement!","I had some problems with this trap - the batteries included didn't work.A second brand new set were zapped before it could work (the batteries do NOT last for fifty caught mice as the product indicates).""Unique tunnel prevents mouse escape "" - this just isn't true. A mouse was able to get into the trap, lick the peanut butter completely clean, and then excape without being zapped (with a new set of batteries).Finally, with a third set of brand new batteries, we were able to catch a mouse last night. We put little bits of american cheese in the back without touching the shock plate(because the mice can lick the peanut butter through the venting holes on the outside without coming in)and finally caught a mouse.Basically, the product is faulty and the design isn't great - for $20, it should work. However, on the third try we did catch a mouse, so I bumped up the one star to 2."
3,Fine if the mouse gets in it,"Left it set for over a year. No mice caught. I saw mice run right over it on the way to somewhere else where there was presumably something more appetizing than peanut butter.No, they weren't getting into it and stealing the bait, the batteries weren't dead, the switch wasn't turned off, the door wasn't open, I have no doubt that it would have killed any mouse that got into it. The trouble was that the mice had no interest in it whatsoever.Finally set one of the old fashioned spring traps on top of it. Five mice in five days. In the _exact_ same spot, _with_ the electronic trap still set. Most of them had not touched the bait on the spring trap either, but it got them anyway when they ran across it."
1,Mouse Wouldn't Go Near It,"Perhaps my mouse is too smart. He hops over glue traps, doens't go near spring traps, so I bought this thinking mice like tunnels.He wouldn't go near it. The bait sits uneaten. I have tried, peanut butter, nutella, rice, other grains, nothing, the mouse is so trap shy he won't go near any traps. I don't think I can trap him. I'll have to go buy mouse poison and hope he gets hungry for it.<Sigh>"
3,"works, when the mice go in","I've had this for about a week now, and only caught one mouse. It was easy to dispose of the mouse, easy to setup and use. However, it doesn't seem nearly as effective as the simple snap-trap mousetraps that I have - those catch more mice, but are much more of a pain to deal with."
3,Works sort of.,"We have cought some mice, but find evidence of the mice still. We bought decon instead. That works better for us. We still have this one set up, but don't get much action with it. One of our friends has one and highly recomends it. So It depends on your situation I guess."
3,First Kill,"I just had my first kill with the Victor Electronic Mouse Trap. It was a good kill, caught between the two contacts and stone dead. The only problem it was not a mouse. It was a cricket. Looks like the Victor Electronic Mouse Trap thinks it is a bug zapper. Emptied and reset easily. Looking for my next kill. Maybe a mouse this time."
1,Don't waste your money,"I followed the instructions exactly and waited for days and days while no mice were caught. Then I put a trail of coco-rice crispies to the metal plates where the mice are supposed to be zapped. They ate all the rice crispies and some of the peanut butter, the light was blinking indicating a dead mouse... but when I opened the trap nothing there.I ordered ""Pest Pro Mouse Glue Boards 75 Count"" from amazon and in less than 4 hours I caught a mouse. It is a little less convient to dispose of them with these traps but at least they work.The victor mouse traps are worthless."
2,"Decent trap, albeit too expensive, nearly impossible to clean","Pros:- Compact, sturdy, easy to setupCons:- Expensive- Very hard to clean the peanut butter out of the unit- Given the above, actual reusability and longevity is in questionMy major gripe on this product is how hard it is to clean. The peanut butter can't sit in there forever, eventually it gets a little rotten and you don't want that smell in your house so it has to be cleaned. The peanut butter, once smeared to the back wall, is imbedded into the vent holes and into the cracks and corners of the inside compartment. I bought 2 units and each unit took me 20 minutes to clean with a bunch of toothpicks, qtips anda bottle of rubbing alcohol. Not well designed with this in mind at all and at this price point, I expect more. Perhaps the sellers are just hoping you'll give up and throw it out so you can buy another one from them? It's cynical to think so but go ahead and try cleaning one and you'll likely agree with me."
3,I don't know what happened...,"I purchased the same product years ago and it worked beautifully...i bought this one within the last few weeks and it doesn't work. I still have a positive opinion of the product based on the first time i used it; it kills quickly without poison, I have dogs and i didn't want mouse poison laying around the house, and the clean-up was easy...just open the top and dump out. I just wish the current one i bought works!"
5,Caught the mouse within 15 minutes,"We were struggling trying to catch this ONE mouse in our house. We had these cheapy trap, one he has to go up a metal ramp and it is supposed to prevent him from escaping, another the door lifts up and closes behind so we cant retreat. The two types were already in the kitchen. We heard the mouse behind the refrigerator. I placed the new trap next to the refrigerator with the opening toward the underside of the refrigerator. I was just getting comfortable on the couch and I thought I heard a buzzing sound. Sure enough, this trap had electocuted and the mouse and the problem was eliminated. Great job Victor!"
5,Good Product,This trap is the best we have used for getting rid of the mice that invade our house. We like how it flashes so you know you have a kill and can dispose of it.
5,This trap never fails,A tiny amt of peanut butter and mice walk over themselves to enter. Many time I found 2 small ones zapped together. If you have a big problem or just a couple this will help you get rid of them. Give it a try but follow the directions about placement. You will be very pleased.
4,Got him.,Totally murdered that mouse. He's dead. Mission accomplished. Light didn't flash so I didn't know he was dead until it started smelling suspicious in my place--then I checked. I'd still recommend the trap though. It worked really well and I just opened the top and dropped him in the trash can. Good alternative to the spring loaded trap.
5,Works great,"Tried several other mouse traps, but this is the one to get. Works great -- easy to check and quick and easy disposal. Don't bother with any other trap -- get this one."
4,This Skeptic Was Wrong,I bought three different kinds of mouse traps for some mice that managed to find a way into our home. I set this one up last night. I was very hopeful yet extremely skeptical of this product to see if itd actually work. Sure enough some time last night a mouse wondered in for our peanut butter and ZAP! Dead mouse. This one was super easy to set and worked like a charm. I am using 4 AA energizer rechargeable batteries. Hopefully these hold up long enough to kill any other mouse that may be left. They are a bit expensive for a mouse trap but there is absolutely no mess! that is pretty nice.
4,A humane way to take care of the problem,"My husband likes knowing that there is no suffering involved, while dealing with the little guys that make their way in during the cold winter. All it takes is batteries."
5,Excellent!!,"The looks of the trap are deceiving, at least it was to me. This thing really does work. It zapped a mouse the first night I set it out. Just smear a little pnut btr on the back wall. Clean up is easy, no mess. Just open the top and dump the mouse out and reset. 4 AA batteries kill up to 100 mice. Excellent product. I am ordering two more."
5,IT REALLY WORKS,I was amazed. This actually works! Quick and clean. It also is the most humane way of disposing of them. (I still felt bad).
3,Not sure if it works or not.,Ordered this at the 1st sign of a mouse in the house! I found the opening and ultimately closed that up. Never have gotten a chance to catch the mouse. I assumed it would work if the mouse when inside. I liked this option as a more humane option to a snap trap which crushes the mouse or especially a sticky trap where the mouse will sometimes rip or chew its own leg off to escape. This company claims that the mouse is electrocuted in about 3 seconds.
1,waste of time and money,"Maybe I just got a bad one, but.... nothing. Buzzed a little when I put the batteries in. Nothing. Tested it. No charge. New batteries, same results. Test light never even flashed once. Worse was trying to send it back. Took over three weeks waiting for UPS to come back and pick it up; three phone calls to customer service. Finally they let me print a return label and drop it off at UPS. Never had these type of problems with Amazon before, hope its not the start of a new trend."
5,Niiice,First night didn't catch any mouse. The second night caught one. Third night caught two little ones. On fourth day I heard a mouse in my room while I was sleeping and put the trap by my door and crumbled a small cookie by the traps entrance. Five minutes later I hear the mouse walking inside and zap! It was a huge mouse compared to the others. So far it's been 3 days and have yet to catch another. Ether they got scared or we don't have anymore. Next time I'll remember to close the basement window .
2,does not work,I know the mice have been around this-- they've left their mark-- but they did not go inside. A drawing of where you are supposed to put the peanut butter would be helpful too. What does the 'back wall' mean?
4,Now Flashes 7 Days,"Just got it today, have not tried it, but the box says that it will flash for 7 days on a kill, several reviews bemoaned that it flashed only 24 hours - will update this when I've actually tried it."
3,My voles are too smart,My voles are eating the peanut butter but not tripping the charge.Voltmeter confirms unit is workingI have placed peanut butter at various locations at end of run
5,It really works Updated: UGH please help,"Just got my trap in, set it up last night and this morning already had a mouse. The only problem is, when a mouse it caught it flashes orange. The box says it will flash green. So, I was a bit confused, as I thought my fresh batteries were already dead.Update: Okay, so I have only caught the one mouse. Now when I turn it on, it flashes green once and then flashes red 5 times. I don't know if that means the batteries are dead or what. I put brand new durcells in it, so if the batteries are dead after one use, then that is pretty sad. I tried to contact Victor but got no reply. I'm very upset, I thought this was a great product a first. I'm changing my rating to 1 star until I get an answer from victor, on what is wrong with my trap!"
3,I think I broke one....,So I have killed one mouse so far. I think that I broke one of the two mouse traps that I bought when I was putting the batteries in. I'm not sure if they are really worth [...] bucks each.
5,Mouse trap,"I bought it for $19.99 + tax from Home Depot. After I set it nothing happened for first 2 days, and I was thinking of returning it. I then put more peanut butterand then it worked like magic. I have already caught 2 in 3 days."
4,Not too shabby,"It is not perfect but it does the job. I like the way I know the skin is protecting it plus I got to keep the same color that I ordered my nano in, red. it makes it a bit bulkier but it is worth it to be able to clip it anywhere."
3,DS LITE Grip,This is great..it is different from the regular DS3..the knotches are not the same *of course..but is still useable for the 3DS..cute color for girls..makes it easier to hold your DS..just make sure..its the LITE...if you want it to fit perfectly..the stereo speakers..not so good...but for the youngest..they wont mind..
4,stero grip,"My teenager just got this and likes it so far. Her friend loves his. Once the newness wears off, I will know better if it was just the newness or if she continues to use it."
5,yummy!!!!!!,Terrific book on the basics. My husband is getting into baking bread and the family is psyhed!
3,My favorite mistake ...,"is a page with a drawing of a loaf of baked bread with beautiful slashes. When you read the recipe, though, it says to make sure you don't slash the bread. I'm amazed at books like this with various errors, especially in the recipes themselves. Why wouldn't the author take the time to make sure her book is printed correctly?"
3,The Bread Bible,"Reading other reviews, I decided to get this book. I used it to make Whole Wheat Bread....... the worst bread I have ever made. I don't know how the other breads are but fear trying them, have put the book away. I would not recommend it."
1,what's a disappointment for the name,"for me, a bread bible should at least briefly cover the essential elements and the basic technicial aspect of bread making. this book have just tons of simple recipes recipes recipes - these i can get freely from the internet within 10 seconds."
2,a disappointment,"The first two recipes I've wanted to try have had errors. One didn't call for milk in the ingredients, but did in the instructions. The instructions for a sesame twist bread made with semolina don't really explain how to twist it. This is one that really could have profited from some kind of illustration. Another irritation is that neither the table of contents nor the index have the page numbers of the recipes--only the page numbers of the sections. Finally, a bread ""bible"" should really have a better recipe for French bread, made with a fermented starter."
4,Be a hero...,...bake the pumpkin bread for your next group meeting.I'm not kidding. I've seen people's eyes roll back in their head eating this bread. Or the scones.
2,Mistakes in both recipes I tried...,"I tried two recipes and both had mistakes--one minor (4 tablespoons butter listed then 1 stick) and one major (less than half the liquid ratio required shown in the ingredient list but called for in the directions). After that, I'm too novice and nervous about wasting my ingredients on a dud. This one is going back to the library."
4,"Mostly excellent, but...","I have been a fan of Beth Hensperger's books for years; in many ways, I attribute whatever success I have had as a baker to the things that I have learned from her. The Bread Bible is a very nice compendium of her work.Unfortunately, the book suffers from poor editing. In two recipies that I have made recently, one failed to specify the baking temperature and the other failed to include an instruction to add a streusel topping (prepared in advance) to some muffins. Neither is serious, particularly to an experienced baker. But such errors can be confusing to the novice, and really are quite inexcusable."
2,The Bread Bible,"While the book has some really great recipes, the instructional part of the recipes is fraught with errors. Read the instructions very carefully before baking.For the beginner it would be helpful to have graphic instruction on ""shaping"" bread."
4,"Lot of different recipes, just wish it was hard covered.","We got this book after purchasing another book claiming to be The Bread Bible. This one has many more recipes. Two things I did not care for is that it doesn't offer the ingredients in grams, just cups/tablespoons. Also, I would like it more if it was a hard cover copy."
4,Exellent Followup,"The cd is an excellent followup to 40 acres. Though not as acoustic, the band has musically matured. Excellent cd, well worth the money."
3,My First Exposure to Caedmon's Call,"I have never heard any other music by this band, so all I can do is rate this CD on its own merits. It is a CD with strong melodies, even stronger harmonies, and some really excellent lyrics. I especially liked the song ""Valleys Fill First"" about how during hard times in our lives (in the ""valleys""), those are the first people God covers in his blessings. The song ""Piece of Glass"" is a deeply insightful and thought-provoking song about the relationship between a person and her mirror. All the songs are at least average (most of them are just average--that's why I give it 3 stars overall), but a few are really really good. I'm sure you could find a better CD than this (and it wouldn't be hard--try Jennifer Knapp), but there is some good stuff on here too."
4,"Pretty good, and yet . . .","After first being exposed to the band this spring, I was thouroughly convinced that they were the most inspiring lyric-writers in Christian music today. Their music was incredible, but the lyrics went even beyond that. Their songs were so intelligent, eloquent, and spoke to me right where I was at. So it was with great anticipation that I bought Long Line of Leavers. I'm disappointed to find that the album seems to be lacking that bold, unique, sound and message of the first two albums. I only find a few scarce lines that really make me think. It's good, and I don't want to discourage anyone from buying it, but I don't think it will be one of my favorites."
4,Best Caedmon's yet,"First of all,I liked the self titled album, and couldn't stand 40 Acres, except for 2 or 3 songs. This one is great. They've finally given us some diversity and livened things up a bit. Perhaps the biggest leap is limiting Aaron Tate's involvement. He only has 3 or 4 songs on this album. Not coincidentally, those are the 3 or 4 I do not like much. This had always been 2 different bands, depending on whether derek Webb or Tate wrote songs. The more Webb the better. The Tate stuff seems to be not much more than pop music, and not very good pop music at that. Hopefully he will continue to be phased out. It can only help the band."
5,;lkadfjg;daghj,"this album is a turning point fo rthe band. they seem to be experimenting with some different sounds on this album as oppsed to past albums. but in spite of what other people thought when it was released, they haven't sold out and they are still 'folk'."
2,Trying to be a pop band,"The weakest of their albums. Sounds like they're trying to be something they aren't (they just released a new album, and they recovered nicely - back to their successful old style).The thing that strikes me about this album is the utter lack of anything moving or clever. The melodies are very bland and uninspired, and the production is pretty flat. Nothing stands out; you don't find yourself humming any of the songs after repeated listens.The shows that supported this disc were equally bland. I guess every artist is expected to produce a few bombs in a career - let's hope this is the only one this otherwise excellent band manages to lay on us."
4,"Long Line Of Leavers is different, like Love","I am extremely happy with the way this album came out. It certainly has many interesting ideas and qualities that have not yet been seen by Caedmon's Call. However, I am a fan, with other Christian college students, who like the old, simple, acoustic sound. The old sound was more acoustic, and this CD is more 'rock n roll' and electric. It isn't the self-titled CD in that respect; but it is worth the music. Cliff, Derek, and Danielle really have grown musically, and vocally, this album proves their growth. 'Piece of Glass' and 'The Only One' are quite creative, and Derek, once again, pulls the listener into his songs with emotion and the incredible musical talent he posses. The truth behind their music is especially evident, along with Derek's new love. It is not as acoustic as was the old, but it deserves to be bought."
4,Nice Bling for Costume,"I am going as Wolverine for Halloween and this buckle helped finish off the costume very nicely. Quick shipping. Buckle was sturdy metal construction. You might want to pick up a belt along with it. I figured I could just go buy a belt at Target or some place at the Mall, but at least around here, no one seems to sell the belts that allow for buckles. What is this society coming to? So yeah, order a belt while you are at it."
5,Great buckle,"Of course I bought this for a Halloween costume, but I love it so much that I wear it regularly. It's slightly curved, so fits great on the belt without coming open. Quality is great.Thanks so much for a nice detail to my costume!"
5,Awesome Belt Buckle,This is an awesome belt buckle. I've worn it almost everyday for over a year and it still holds up really well. It actually outlasted the belt it was on! I can't tell you the amount of compliments I get on it week after week. Would definitely recommend.
4,Easy install,"Got this to change the ignition system on my '72 Opel GT from points and condenser to the more reliable electronic system. Relatively easy to install (though did have to drill a hole in the housing for the wires. The beautiful hint is that the car now starts up first time every time, even when it is cold. No longer do I have to allow 10 minutes to start the car in the morning!"
1,What a terrible dvd about Susan Boyle,"I love Susan Boyle too much but I hate this dvd. What a terrible dvd about Susan Boyle. There isn't any subtitle available, quality is very poor, not included any booklet and very poor quality cover images. Documentary is very boring. There isn't any interview with Susan Boyle and other interviews are taked from Youtube in poor quality. Video quality and audio quality is really poor in these videos. Some people talking about her but believe me you will never want to listen them. So I don't accept this dvd and I think Intrinem Films make money from her fame. NEVER BUY THIS DVD & DON'T SPEND YOU MONEY & STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD"
2,2nd Rate Documentary,"Very disappointing unauthorized biography with pieced together clips of Susan Boyle's life assembled from various media sources - very dry narration - with a few interesting clips from UK reporters interviewing her brother, Larry King interviewing Elaine Page and the Britain's Got Talent stars. Slow-paced, but for fans of Susan worth the still photos and the video interviews. I wished I had bought the used version and save a few more dollars."
1,Disappointing!,"This should never have been listed as a ""movie"". When I ordered this item I expected it to be an actual movie not a poorly executed documentary that did not include one single song performed by Susan Boyle. It included photographs and some news videos and was not as good as an amateur home movie. As a huge fan of Susan Boyle's I was not only disappointed but felt that I had been ""ripped off"". I actually threw it in the garbage because I wouldn't feel right giving it or selling it to anyone else. This ""movie"" did a disservice to an extraordinary performer who deserved better. I am thankful that I bought her wonderful CD!"
1,Awful,"Susan Boyle from Pain to Fame is just a terrible DVD. I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my Mom as she loves Susan Boyle's music. This DVD is a HUGE disappointment. The quality is amateurish, very poor. It's as if someone create this in their basement. The makers ""borrowed"" mostly pictures and pieced this together. Reminded me of a school project (only I think a student would do a much better job). I was going to donate it to our local library, but after viewing it in its entirety-it's going in the trash bin."
1,DREADFUL!,Dreadful exploitation of the Susan Boyle name. Don't get taken advantage of like I did. Just because something has her name on it does not mean it is a valuable item.
3,FANZOFSUSAN,IF YOUR A FAN OF SUSAN YOU PROBABLY WOULD THINK THIS DVD IS OK. THERE WAS SOME OLD INFO IN THE FILM. BUT IT SHINES A BRIGHT SPOT ON HER AMAZING CHALLENGES WHICH SHE CONQUERED. LEARNED A COUPLE A NEW THINGS ABOUT HER LIFE GROWING UP. LIKED IT!
1,Thank you!,"Thank you everyone for your honest reviews!! I almost made the mistake of ordering this DVD, I am so glad I read your reviews first!"
2,By the CD'S not the DVD,"It was a good DVD but, not the best. I was hoping it would have had more of Susan Boyle singing and when she performed on TV. I love her CD'S."
1,A disappointment,"A disappointing pastiche of old videos and poor-quality audio. I was hoping for more video of Susan singing. All in all, an amateurish result. However, since I am a fan of Susan, I would recommend other fans buying the DVD. She is going to become extremely famous one day and this, albeit inferior, DVD will become a collector's item. Vive Susan!"
4,Good History,I enjoyed seeing more of Susan Boyle's life as she progressed from before her Britain's Got Talent performance to her experience after. Great for all Susan Boyle fans.
5,A deeply enthralling narrative of epic spiritual proportions,"The Genizah At The House Of Shepherd is a sweeping novel that follows the return of an English biblical scholar to her grandparents' home in Jerusalem. Immersed in a simmering family feud concerning the so-called ""Shepher Codex"", she discovers the history of her family, from the great-grandfather who traveled to Babylon in search of the ten lost tribes, to her grandfather's Zionist ideals that caused conflict with his religion, to the tragic love affair of her parents and her own sad past. As much a parable of the transformations in Jerusalem over a hundred and thirty years as it is the story of one woman's struggle for identity and search for answers, The Genizah At The House Of Shepherd is a deeply enthralling narrative of epic spiritual proportions."
1,What a boring book.,"What a boring book. The story goes back and forth between the present and people from the past - the great-grandfather, grandfather, father, and a few others - but at the end of the day, none of these people are at all interesting. Regarding the codex supposedly at the center of the book, there is nothing but a few paragraphs that address this . . . its meaning and significance. The book should more properly be called the meanderings of a 40-something woman frustrated with just about everything in her life."
2,Not too interesting,This was not a good book. I found it difficut to stay focused. It did not hold my interest.
5,great cd,"this cd contains many familiar love songs a la juangabriel. i was looking for a version of the song""asi fue"" and this cd delivers."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"It was okay. These may be the all-time greatest songs, but perhaps not the all-time greatest performances of them."
2,Just another run of the mill christmas album,just a run of the mill album puts a little mood in the air for the season!Another review police technic to keep you from posting a quick simple review one word should be suffiencent.
5,LOVE CHRISTMAS MUSIC!,"THIS CD ARRIVED VERY PROMPTLY AND I HAVE BEEN ENJOYINGIT SINCE THAT TIME. I LISTEN TO CHRISTMAS MUSIC ALLYEAR, AND IT IS GREAT!"
5,Dead End,Service was excellent. Advertisement was right on thanks for giving me what I wanted in this product.
4,Fruit Fly,Great book to take to the beach. Fun characters that take your mind off the hum drum daily grind.
1,shopworn,"""Although I detected a feeble attempt at humor while reading Fruit Fly,I felt pity for Ms. Tucker. She is obviously trying to mask her fear inthis ""lighthearted novel"". This topic is even too shopworn for Dr. Phil,so I recommend an enrollment in ""Creative Writing I"" at the localcommunity college."""""
1,Easy Read?,"This might be considered an easy read for those who can overlook redundant, boring descriptions, no plot and not one interesting character. Ms. Tucker might consider an alternative medium for venting her frustration. Writing is not her forte.Who allows these books to get published anyway!"
5,A great read!,"Fruit Fly is a pleasant change from the mainstream romances. The main character, Katie, is a lovable woman, who draws strength from her friends, a group of gay men who would do anything for her & each other. It's wonderful to watch a romance blossom between two of her friends as her own romance comes to life."
2,Nice Monitor but mine was defective,"I was very pleased to find a good quality flat screen at this price point. However, after several months of ownership my monitor has become defective and I'm in the process of sending it back to the manufacturer. I have owned several other monitors in the past (both CRT and LCD) and I have never had problems with any of them except this one."
5,Nice :-),Product arrived on time well packaged and works just fine. I bought this moniter and a computer pcu put them together and they both work and are in good condition. I've been having it now since March and my son loves it!
5,I LOVE THIS THING!!,I just got my new monitor and I love it! It was easily installed and no dead pixels. Extremely easy on the eyes. The black frame looks great!
4,This is tight,"I just bought this monitor and have had it for less than a day. I just thought I'd write a review since I have nothing better to do. Overall, I think this monitor is tight. I got it from here and it came very fast. Also, there are no dead pixels, which is a plus. Gaming looks great on it, no ghosting. Thus, the response time is very nice. I only gave it 4 stars because I know for a fact that there are better ones out there (the super high end ones that are $1,0000). I recommend it to anyone looking for a new monitor."
4,good upgrade from standard size CRT's,"I got this to save space on my desk and it functions great for that. The installation was really easy. The image quality is good but perhaps not the very best for really intense applications. However, for those for whom $$$ is a fair price to pay to dispose of that clunky 17 inch monitor, the one that takes up about 1/2 of a good sized desk, this NEC seems like the best choice. I don't really dig the roundedness of the edges though; it kind of looks like it was designed 10 years ago. In summary, this may not provide the most stunning graphics ever, but if you are looking for a 15 inch LCD, you will not go wrong if you get this one."
5,A Mystical Book for the Mathematically-Oriented,I used to be a skeptic about this until I bought and used this book. I tested it out on someone (with book in hand) who was in their early 60's going back over the different phases of their life and they acknowledged the different opportunities that the results indicated. I did this with the book in hand plus pen and paper. The chapters are easily organized and easy to understand. This is a great starter numerology book!NOTE: This book uses the ancient Chaldean interpretation of letters to numbers instead of the modern Western version.
1,Convoluted Arab Propaganda,"This movie is a total distortion of the truth and a rewriting of history from the point of view of the Arab propaganda machine. Even though at first it had some ""clout"" of legitimacy, I soon realized that important facts about Jewish and Israeli history were purposefully omitted to suit the extremely anti-Israeli views of the producers. It is scary to realize how easy it is to transform perfectly legimate historical events into ""atrocities"" by omitting some ""dismissible"" facts. This is an example of brainwashing, not history, and it is a shame for the producers."
1,PLO Propaganda anti-semitic film,"Incredible! the rewritting of the real story in this film is incredibly crafty, a masterpiece of deceit, propaganda and corruption."
2,Not necessary.,"I use the LSP5000 (see my review) without using the memory card functions. I feel that the card's functions should have been integrated into the unit itself and that as it stands now, these are just one more way for the company to milk its customers. The strips themselves are quite costly, so I am content to simply write the cholesterol results in a small notepad."
4,a must read,this book will most definitely help you get people to see the best in themselves.unlike other books I have read; this one helps me understand how to encourage rather than tear down
2,"Some good points but too much ""I""","Art Williams provided some valuable points in his book but it is too much: ""I...."""
5,IRV GOTTI PRESENTS THE MURDERERS,"THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN A WHILE. WE DON'T GIVE A F**K IS DEFINATLEY MY FAVORITE. IT HAS LOTS OF OTHER SONGS THAT A GOOD. THERE IS NOT A BAD ONE ON THIS CD. IT ALSO HAS SONGS FROM OTHER ALBUMS LIKE HOW MANY WANNA DIE FROM THE LIGHT EM UP SOUNDTRACK. IF YOUR A JA RULE FAN OR JUST A FAN OF GREAT RAP THEN YOU NEED TO GET THIS CD. OH YEA IT ALSO HAS A HOLLA HOLLA REMIX WITH JAY-Z, BUSTA RHYMES AND OTHERS."
3,Murder Inc. is worth the $$$,"First of all, don't expect this cd to sound like Venni Vetti Vecci, but it holds its own. I gave it a three because there are two flaws that I found. First is that Black Child really has no skillz. His songs are the songs to skip. Second, as much as I love DMX, I dont feel that he belongs on this cd. This album was made to introduce Ja's crew, and DMX has his Ruff Ryder compliations. But overall the cd has tight beats and good tracks. The 7 Ja Rule songs are worth the buy. Tah Murder (Cadillac Tah) is tight too."
5,Banging!,"If you don't have it, you gots to go get it. This album is tight. Irv Gotti dropped a hot gem on 'em with this one. The beats are murderous, lyrics are murderous, the whole album just murderous. Just one thing. I don't think DMX's solo, ""Tales from the Darkside"", belonged on the album, it just didn't fit in. I'll HOLLA, HOLLA!"
4,IT's decent,"Regardless of what you think of Murder Inc. now. Back when this album dropped it was a decent album. If you like producers who sample familiar movie and TV themes then you'll love ""We dont' give a f*@%"", which samples the Rocky theme and ""How Many Wanna Die"" which samples the first part of the McGuyver theme. Plus it's a pretty hard album and has a joint with DMX before the Ja Rule/DMX beef. It's worth the money if you a fan of gritty street albums."
3,the album is great (when it is unsensered),This album is a must have for true ja rule fans. the album helps to redeam him from his disapointing 3:36. It is also good for true hip hop fans. So if u fit in anyone of these catagories you should buy this album!!!
1,Murder Inc. is finished.,"No one cares about Murder Inc. anymore. They are finished in the rap world. Whatever happened to Charli Baltimore's album. She got benched again. And all of Ja Rule's albums have been wack except for his radio singles but he is not consistent. R.I.P. Ja Rule and the fake Gotti brothers. haa haaa. Murder Inc. was extorted by ""Supreme"". Haaa"
2,Ruff Ryders Lite.,"The Murderers are like the Ruff Ryders with no flow, no beats, and even worst lyrics. The extra star is for Irv Gotti, who came through with a decent beat once in a while, but this album is straight booty."
3,"Nice camera, but I still prefer sony",This is a nice camera but the sony's anti shaking is too much better. The mp3 player is a nice feature but by the end of the day I still use my Ipod instead.
4,Good pictures and great looks,"It takes good pictures and videos with sound.It looks really good.Has lots of features (that you will not use).It is well priced.I love the fact that you can charge it while the battery in in the camera. (Canon get a hint please).One minor thing: The front of the camera becomes a little warm after a lot of flash photography. Nothing to worry about and it does not get hot, just warm. (It was not just mine that got warm, I tested another one that my friend has)."
1,Not for Mac,I wish I would have known that this camera does not really work with a Mac. Amazon allowed me to return it with no problems however.
1,Picture quality is horrible,"I don't know what people are raving about. The picture quality on this thing is absolutely horrible. I can see a better picture without my glasses than wearing glasses looking at a picture taken with this camera. I dont know the techy term but I think its called noise or lens aberation or something. I know its not a quality german lens like zeiss, or nikon or canon, but this camera i just horrible. Maybe ok for your 6 year old kid."
5,Great Product,"A great camera for everyday people for everyday purposes of memorable photos. It takes good-quality photos and has multiple features that may trigger an interest in users. MP3 and PMP player another plus, adding to the versatility to this great product. This camera does all the things an electronics-savvy person would dream about. Does its purpose as a camera and adds features like MP3 to increase the entertainment value. A great buy for a great product."
5,A cold war odyessey,"This book is essentially an autobiography focusing on that part of the author's life on an obscure island in the Outer Hebrides, St Kilda, during the years of the Cold War when the deserted island was used by the UK as a station for sighting incoming missiles from the USSR. It is at once, historically meticulous as are all of Mackay's works and was actually first put to paper more than 40 years ago when he was a young Lieutenant in the army. It re-visits the history of the island and the causes for the evacuation of its native population in 1930 and is now part of the National Trust For Scotland World Heritage Site besides being one of the most important seabird breeding sites in north west Europe. It is also the story of a young soldier and his sometimes military, sometimes funny, occasionally amorous and always interesting adventures on a remote island during one of the eras of the Cold War. A good read that is difficult to put down."
2,American Farm Tractor Trademarks:,"Not what I expected from C H Wendel, just drawings of the Trademarks, I thought it would be pictures of the actual Tardemarks. Very disappointing."
3,these boots were made for walking.,"after dead letter chorus, i thought i had found my new favorite band, its right next to weezer, the rentals, blur and travis in my collection. dead letter chorus was fun. if you werent moving with the music after three listens, then you werent really listening. these young artists have pinned down what exciting music is. if they manage to stick it out and stay together, im sure these kids will surprise us all. their songwriting will come around, this album seems more forced then the first one. if you want to try them out try dead letter chorus, if you like that you'll enjoy this, but dont dive straight into el toppo. you'll have to appreciate their melodies first."
4,keep the beat going,"When I first heared the llamas I was really surprized at how they put together the melodies and beat, but it was a great combination of songs that lead to a super first albam. This has continued into El Toppo, which can be a hard transition for many artists. They are a great band live and on CD, which is another aspect that many bands can't pull off. Good Job on the new albam and keep it up."
2,Major typo!!,"I should have been an editor....in my copy, on page 245, 5th paragraph, Leilani appears on the patio to tell her new husband Luke, ""Darling, I think the Kahlua is done...""; 3 paragraphs later, it states ""Kokua and Uli, who had followed Andria to the patio.."" Geez, Andria, the heroine, wasn't even there. It should have said Leilani, not Andria."
5,"Fascinating book, interesting for all levels of scientist or sports fan","This book was written in a fun, intersting style, while at the same time explaining complex scientific principles and research facts in a straight-forward way so that everyone can understand it, either the interested sports fan or the trained scientist/engineer."
4,Delightful!,Extremely short but really a fun read. Great quotes to meditate on. Probably better to use as a devotional - it will go very quickly if you read straight through. well worth it.
4,The Best of Nana Mouskouri 20th Century Master Millennium Collection - It is OK,I think her best work is her movie album and I wish you would do another one... She has a\wonderful voice...
1,Superbly stupid,"As an avid reader of several genres, I was completely disappointed with Berhhardt's (Bryne?)Double Jeopardy. I suppose the jeopardy was in buying the book. The first few pages,including the opening trial scene were fairly good - then the plot becomes increasingly incredible, implausible, and just plain silly. A crime/legal/murder novel should at least have some plausibility - this book has zero. I only kept reading it to see how inane the plot would become. I ended up hating the book so much, I would not have been displeased had the hero been put out of his misery - that ending might have redeemed the book."
4,"An engaging, exciting and satisfying chase novel.","The legal thriller genre has been overshadowed by the Grishams of the land, unfortunately obscuring some very skilled writers like William Bernhardt. This novel begins as a courtroom drama but soon develops into a fast-paced chase plotline a la The Fugitive. There's an edge here that Grisham seems to have lost; readers disappointed by Grisham's latest overly planned-out novels will find a fresh sense of recklessness, uncertainty and spontanaeity in Bernhardt. Well-written, deft characterization, and satisfying plot twists. Two thumbs up"
2,A waste of time.,"As a fan of William Bernhardt I am sorely disappointed. I've enjoyed tremendously other titles by him and was expecting, if not a flawless book, at least one that would not stretch my easily stretchable credulity past the breaking point. It's a silly book. I'm grateful I checked it out from the library."
5,DOUBLE RATES A HIGH FIVE!!!!!,"I have read all the so called ""Justice"" books by Bernhardt but I think I liked this one the best of any of his I have read.Travis Byrne is the new hero. He is an ex-cop with a law degree, but don't let that fool you, he is not good in fights or pulling the trigger. His new clint shoots his way out of the courthouse and takes off. He along with some other people try to make it look like Travis was in on the shoot out. Byrne ends up with many different groups looking for him, the mob, the local police, the FBI and one person acting on his own. He does get some help from two unexpected people. There is lots of action, it is a very fast moving book. I found my self nearly skimming pages to find out what happened next. Has a great ending. Surprising, to me, but great."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"What a disappointment! I bought this book because I like the genre, and because of the glowing reviews already posted on this site. Unfortunately, I found the plot to be utterly reposterous, and the dialogue weak. This book was very poorly written."
1,Complete waste of money!!! ZERO STARS!!!,"It should be against the law to sell a piece of junk like this! The ""material"" sticks to EVERYTHING! I mean everything! It would not come out of the package! I had to literally SCRAPE it out of the pouch it came in. Then, it sticks to your hands. Then it sticks to the little stick they give you to smooth it out. Then, it sticks to the wax paper they tell you to put it on. You have been warned!!!"
4,Loved these ornaments,"These were awesome. Very easy to use, no mixing or mess and only took about 15 minutes to do! We actually used this for both our dog's paw print and our little boy's handprint and gave them as gifts. Would definitely recommend this product if you are wanting to create a keepsake item or gift."
5,Great price & quick shipping.,"I bought this to make a paw print from my cat, Chloe. She's going to be 15 on Valentine's day & since she's getting up there in years I wanted a paw cookie for her. Her sister passed away 6 yrs ago @ UIUC @ the veterinary teaching hospital. When I got back her ashes they had included a small organdy mesh bag w/ a little clipping of Kirbie's fur & one of these that they'd imprinted her paw into & put her name on. It was unexpected & very appreciated. The only problem w/that one was I had to bake it. I was so afraid of either underbaking or burning it (if that's possible) since I don't bake at all. I didn't want to ruin it since it was one of a kind @ that point. This one just air dries so no worries. I'll either do it myself, if I can hold her long enough, or I'll take it to my vet's office. They said they do them all the time & could do it for me too. Great price & got it pretty quickly too."
2,maybe it has a limited shelf-life?,"was so excited about this that I bought 4 kits (for grandparents and ourselves), but, while the kit was well designed, the impression material appeared too solid/dry to take an impression -- it sprung right back, leaving either no mark, or a very faint shadow (after I pressed her hand really hard). am hoping that I'll hear it was a bad batch or something, but otherwise it's a complete bummer for our first Christmas attempt at a memento..."
2,"Okay, not great","I bought this to make impressions of my infant's feet. The compound was ultra sticky; about a quarter of it would not come out of the package, and i had to let it air dry for forty minutes before i could get his feet out without it sticking. This made the goo almost too dry to hold a good impression. It worked, but it was a pain and not as nice as i would have liked for my son. Probably just fine for the intended dog use though."
4,*A Bargain*,"This tape is very good and I enjoyed it a lot. I did not know this artist, and was hesitant, but am glad I bought it. For this price, you will not regret it."
5,Satellite antenna for second car,This is the similar to what came with my unit originally. However the base does not exactly fit my unit. For me it doesn't matter.
3,Warm and worthwhile,"This CD has received a couple of really crabby reviews online -- lighten up! I listen to it every year. The songs are performed with genuine warmth and affection. Yes, ""Burgundian Carol"" IS a highlight. Yes, the arrangement of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" may be just this side of outrageous, but I think it's joyful and fun. If you're fond of Don McLean, I say this disc is worth it."
1,Ouch. This is a really bad CD.,"I had high hopes when I first saw this CD; I love Don McLean and Christmas music both. Unfortunately, McLean phoned in this performance. He sounds actually bored reading ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas."" ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" would almost be funny if weren't so awful. Only ""Burgundian Carol"" rises to the top; why didn't do the whole album in this style?"
1,ewwwwww.....i cant belive how bad,wow...i cant believe this is the same person that had all those great songs on American Pie...sounds like he has the Ray Coniff singers backing him... can we say contractual obligation album?
2,disappointingly bland,"I will keep this short to avoid being cruel: this has to be the first book written by the author. I bought it hoping to gain insight into the intriguing work of an obscure musician but instead found bland cliche after cliche in what amounts to a collection of anecdotal recollections and needless detail , with little expansion on Heard's life beyond his everyday tedium. It explores Mark's spiritual journey but with little depth. This disorganized history is repetitious, dull and just a monotonous read. I know there has to be more depth to this life but a litany of accolades, all similar, (and pages of lyrics that can be found on the records)is very unsatisfying.Skip this, listen to the records."
4,Interesting flick,I have never seen anything like this so I have no way to compare it other than to itself. A very interesting story.
2,Complete?,"I purchased this book after I bought my first boat expecting to get some information from an experienced person. I have a lot of friends I can talk to about cars but, nobody to talk to about boats - especially a competition ski boat. I was hoping to get some incite into the workings of a boat, especially some suggestions regarding maintenance and the function of things I didn't have much experience about like a stuffing box or raw water pump or direct drive. I was dissapointed.It's a great book to start out with, if you don't know how an engine works or the basic function of a boat. If you are looking for maintenance tips, performance suggestions, solutions to problems you are having or anything specific, look elsewhere. This book gives an overview of these areas but no real information that you can use to diagnose a problem. You couldn't even close down your boat for the winter from the information. It is not comprehensive.""General Guide to Gasoline Marine Engines"" should be the title."
2,If you have never travelled to developing nations....,"If you have never traveled to developing nations in out of the way places then you might find this book useful. However, you can find much of this information through the U.S. CDC and W.H.O. websites.Most times the happy little diseases or maladies that travelers take home are things that cause diarrhea. This book clearly lacks information related to many important aspects of food handling, processing, and stomach wellness. However if you want to know about exotic illnesses you will probably never get than maybe this book is helpful.I would not recommend this book."
4,If you don't really know..,"...where to go in central and south america, then read this through. As with all Lonely Planets book, it got lots of information! I want to go to Guatemala or Ecuador, but I didn't really know too much about any of these countries. Reading this through helped me. I'm going to BOTH!"
4,good,"Pretty good. Billie is a really good character. But I think she and Steven needed to work things out so much better, though. Oh, and Liz posing as a waitress at that resturant was pretty cool, too."
2,Software needs to be updated,"This software needs to be updated. First, the newer Vista operating system does not seem to work with the program and there appears to have been no new options or improvements with the program for quite some time now."
2,no cd included,"i bigth it because the cd rom tool, but it came with no cd, very disapointed. i think the provider should send the cd to fulfill what promised"
3,False description,"Bought from this particular venue because it said ""with student CD-ROM"", but it didn't come with the CD. Other than that the book is in excellent shape."
1,The CD did not work!!!,"The Book is OK but I could not install the CD-Rom!!! The CD has an expiration date, I guess..."
2,Wonderful....,I don't think you should be able to list a book title with a CD on it if the CD doesn't come with the purchase you have made. Maybe it is a ISBN problem. Good thing the professor said it's not important to passing the class. But otherwise the book is in WONDERFUL condition and I payed a GREAT price for it.
5,Be a Hero (book),Be a Hero: A Battle for Mercy and Social JusticeA wonderful book so timely for the needs of our country and foreign countries. Well thought out and the author is practicing what he is preaching.Highly recommend this book.
5,Amazing!,"This CD is amazing, all of the songs are great and really danceable! Just pop the CD in when you want to feel your spirit be lifted up, because that's exactly what this CD does for you. Be sure to check out Mysterious Times - it's the best song that's come out in a long time in the entire musical genre!"
2,What's the hype?,Let me just tell you....the only good song on the whole cd is Mysterious Times. The rest is just awful. I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about. They must not know bad music when they hear it. I wouldn't recommend buying it.
1,don't spell words,This audio book is the one of the worst audio book I ever purchased. This audio book donsn't SPELL the words. The company sells the script (PDF format) for US$24.00 which is very expensive for an eBook. CD 5-13 and 2 bonus DVDs don't have any useful information. They are simply useless to me!
1,Item Never Received,I am still waiting for this item to arrive. It has been one month now and I still have not received it. I don't know if it was ever shipped???? I would not recommend this company in the future because they charged me and did not ship my item.
1,Morgan Llywelyn's Story Galway Bay ONLY,"This book started out so well, but it fizzled fast. The scenery of Ireland shined, which is the ONLY reason this story deserved 1 star, but the girl, Eileen Costello, who was vacationing there, had little personality and it was hard to get to know her because the author gave us no physical description, no hair or eye color, etc, only a slightly tempermental New Yorker whose ex-boyfriend turned out to be married.Eileen's love interest in Ireland is called ""Mrs. Daly's son.""*He has no name.*And it was never made clear what it was Mrs. Daly's son saw in Eileen to make her 'the one.' He didn't know anything about her!When we first meet Mrs. Daly's son at the restaurant, he made a wonderful impression and it seemed the story would be great, but after that initial encounter, Eileen doesn't see him again until the end of the book. And I do mean the end. The very last sentence, to be exact."
3,Irish Magic not so magical,"I found it difficult reading. I have read 28 of Susan Wiggs books and this I like the least. Of course it contains other authors other than Wiggs. I think her story was the best of the four. It contains a lot of Irish words, which I had to try to pronounce, which took away from the smoothness of the read."
4,Educational overview of gender confusion.,"Very moving and illuminating look at the manifestation of gender confusion in transsexuality and transvesticism. By objectively focusing on personal case studies the dilemmas and emotions faced by those who are asking ""What Sex Am I?"" are very understandable to the most traditional heterosexual."
4,From Responsibility of church membership to Generosity,"It was used to start our church on a path from responsibility to generosity based on God's generosity in our lives. It takes stewardship out of the drudgery of motivating people to ""best"" last years $ goal, to considering stewardhip as a response to the God's generosity in our lives."
4,Summary of Book,This book has added more ammunition to my repertoire when speaking to my congregation about giving and tithing. I love the easy read format and will be using it as a reference in the future.
4,Grip it reverse,"These reverse grips keep the ball coming off the club straighter. It feels to me like I have more control. I took it off my driver but, put extra tape rap on the Right hand area (It may or may not have promoted too much right hand power creating a big fad but it's a new driver as well)."
2,Fun but cheaply made,"Our 4-year-old son received the Action City Fire Station for Christmas. He loves playing with it, but constantly needs our help because the pieces come apart/break off constantly. Very cheap, not durable. I'm very disappointed."
3,Fire station,Save your money and buy something else. It's not worth it. Very cheap small parts. Easily falling apart. It's not for 4 year old boy.
2,Flat,"I only finished half of this book before putting it down, but unless the characters or the writing change tremendously, I couldn't give this more than two stars. It seems like an interesting story, but the characters are flat, and the vocabulary and speech of the girl and the dragon seems weird and forced the whole book. I started this because my daughter is really into fantasy, wanted to read this, but is only 9 years old. I haven't come across anything that I think would be too mature for her, but I really don't want her to waste her time when there are so many good books out there."
4,Great Dragon story,"This book was the best chinese dragon book I have ever read. It's about a slave girl named Ping, who has to take care of the dragons for her master. soon there's only one dragon left, named Danzi. Ping runs away with Danzi and Danzi's special stone. They go on many adventures to get to the isle of blest, pursued closly by the dragon slayer Diao. They meet many other characters, some good, some bad. Ping has to help Danzi get to the Isle of Blest and accept her destiny as Dragon Keeper.This is a good book. I put it right up there with Dragon Rider."
5,an amazing book',"This book is one of the best books I've ever read. I think that anybody from the ages 10 and up would love this book. It is about a slave girl and she finds out that she is a dragon keeper. She goes on a journey wit ha dragon named Danzi and they are heading on there way to the ocean, but on there way they will face many dangers. It is a very suspenceful book and I love it.:) so I hope you read this book now because you would really enjoy it!(P.S. this not Carolyn this is alex her son)"
5,WOW,"i cant believe how great this book was! an exelent adventure of a girl and a dragon who journey on a quest to protect a ""dragon stone"". It was so good that I read it again! There could not be a more perfect example of friendship, and how to try new things. This is definatly in my top 5 favorite books and I read alot of GREAT books including this one."
2,An adults perspective,"S9ometimes it was hard to stay at the main characters level, her being uneducated and unworldly. I expected insights that would go over her head, but instead we stayed on her level the whole way. Considering most twelve year olds are already reading adult books, it might been nice to credit the reader with a tad more intelligence"
4,Read this aloud to your grandkids--,"If you have a grandchild who is into dragons, you've found the perfect read-aloud novel to enjoy together. The characters are excellent. The pacing is brisk. You'll find much to discuss and share. JM"
5,My FAVORITE book of all-time,"This book is vibrabtly illustrated with immense detail and you never want to put it down. But, it has a cliche and cliffhanger ending. However, It does leave room for a sequel to snap it right into that place of perfection. A defininte must-buy."
5,Great book but a different author,"Contrary to the provided information, this book is written by Maurice Magre and translated into english bij Reginald Merton.Magre was a poet to the bone, and it shows in this book too. He covers a lot of topics like Appolonius of Tyana, the Cathars, Flamel, and the rosicrucians. Using them as examples, he shows how quite normal man transformed into sages. However, he also shows their shortcommings, which can be quite a relief for those of us who are not yet sages.Magre was no enthousiastic supporter of the catholic church, which shows most clearly in his chapters on the Cathars and Albigenses, who were persecuted and killed until the very last one."
3,there are better cameras out there,"i had this camera for about a year, and it has terrible low light picture quality. really bad noise. it is decent for macro, and day shots though or just for a camera to have carrying around if you don't want to use a DSLR but still want decent picture quality. oh it also has a terrible battery life. and when shooting video it cuts audio recording when you zoom in or out."
2,Not suitable with name....,Little bit ok but not to much performance....sony any model better than this...don't go with name.
1,In Accurate Information,"The jacket cover and your online presentation of this CD conflict with the actual program (listing on the back cover). The song ""Peace Brother Peace"" has been replaced with ""Unchained Melody"", again, with no notification on either the front cover or your online presentation.Yes! I will be receiving a credit, but the incovenience of processing the return and the failed anticipation of having the aforementioned song on my IPOD for a recent trip to Washington, D.C......was disturbing."
5,simply the best there is,"There is no better recording of Cape Breton piping available from anyone. Compared to Shears the others are wannabe's. Barry lays down the rhythms and expresses the tunes like no other piper. His piping is confident, clean and bold. His pipes have a beautiful, clear sound. The accompaniment enhances the piping, and it is traditional. The back up musicians are the same you will find on recordings by Natalie MacMaster and Mary Jane Lamond. There is a lot made among pipers these days about the Cape Breton style, or Gaelic piping, but none have hit the mark as consistently and musically as Shears does here. This is a modern classic."
1,NOT THE SAME AS THE REAL ALBUM,"I wish I would have taken the other reviews to heart. I bought this CD especially for the song ""Christmas Waltz"" done by the brothers - I put it on and the song is now slower and includes Marie - and it sucks. I sure do wish I could get my money back on this one. It is just like so many others have said - this is not like the album that was put out in the 70's."
5,Christmas Memories,This is one of the best Christmas Albums ever. It brings home my childhood whenever I listen to it. I grew up with the Osmonds. Anyone who is or was an Osmond fan will love this. Their voices blend so wonderfully..
3,What's Missing!,"I have the original vinal LP. I was truly hoping that the listing of songs shown for the CD was a partial list. The original album was a double record set.I am disappointed that the CD is incomplete. There were some nice ( and different) pieces on the original LP.If the complete version is availabe somehow,I would like to know how to get it."
3,Enjoyable Holiday Music,I owned the original Osmond Family Christmas on vinyl LP. There were more songs on the orignial than on this released CD. Yes I know you can get more music on a CD. However there are several songs missing. To me it should be the complete album. This was very disapointing since I am a fan. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A 2CD collection.
5,Beautiful design,Beautiful design that I bought to match the flatware that we already have however it is discontinued and difficult to find.
1,ugly,"When I bought this product I was expecting something completely different. for starters the latch on these earrings are horrible, they don't work very well and are hard to get on. the bar to the earring is very thick for an earring."
2,What a let down,"I placed my order for this book on Amazon in April 1999! Over one year later, it finally arrived on my doorstep. I just finished the EXCELLENT Lingo and Director in a Nutshell books and was looking for the same level of analysis for my preferred OS. I didn't get it. Yes, this is a fine book for beginners, but anyone who has used a Mac for over a year will find little to add to what they have learned through day to day use. As a Mac user, I am not crazy about the choice of a chimp on the book's cover. Is the implication that even a chimp can use the MacOS? It actually comes across as saying the Mac is ""not as highly evolved as other OSs"" and ""Only a monkey would use this product."" Let's hope O'Reilly has an excellent OS X book in the pipe to make up for this one."
4,"Been there, this is great CD",I visited Tanzania and Kenya last year and got to hear a little of the local music. This is a great representation of part of the music of the area and brings back great memories.
4,..yup..it's a locking gas cap...,"At first I thought it was alittle ""sticky"" in the lock, but it broke in and works fine now. A product that will do exactly what you think...no less...no more"
2,Dissapointing,The photo quality isn't great and it's a lot of photos that you have seen before. I don't think it was worth the price.
5,Incredible Book!!,"Properly titled VINTAGE NEON (as shown on the cover) this book contains incredible photos and narrative of these beautiful works of art. Fans of ""Americana"" will especially enjoy this fading slice of American Roadside Life."
3,Great Monitor for the Price.,"This is a great monitor for the price. I got this monitor for someone who needed a monitor mainly for word processing and browsing the web.The default resolution is 1,024 x 768 pixels (and it won't look very good at any other resolution). NEC recommends setting the screen to this resolution, and then making the system type size larger - and that works fine.I wouldn't recommend this monitor for graphic designers or photographers only because the color seems to change when viewed from different angles. Also, the colors don't seem to be uniform from one side to another - it's just like a laptop monitor (if you don't need color accuracy, then this isn't an issue).And lastly, the monitor itself looks really cool (I purchased the black one), and you can push it back to free up your desk space."
1,Other than the defects and Amazon's return policy...,"it's great. Long story short. Bought monitor early December as a gift for my husband. By the time holidays were past and monitor was discovered to be defective, we were no longer able to return. Instead, we must go through NEC. They sent us another monitor to replace it. This one was also defective - 2 pixels burned out on the screen. Apparently there is a 7 pixel policy so we are unable to return to NEC. They sent us back to Amazon who refuses to do anything about it. You may be thinking 2 burned out pixels isn't so bad, but when you are working with graphics 10 hours a day they become a constant irritation. BEWARE - do not buy online. You will be stuck with less than desirable merchandise. Instead, help out your local dealers. Not only will they appreciate the business, but will be much more likely to go the extra mile to insure customer satisfaction."
1,More like a minus 5 stars!,"Have you ever tried to view a 15"" monitor at 1024x768 resolution, which is the recommendation for ""Optimal Performance"" with the MultiSync LCD1550V monitor. I wear corrective lenses, but my corrected vision is still 20/30, and I have to strain my eyes to read anything on this monitor. In addition, compared to my 17"" Avitron Trinitron monitor, the colours on the NEC-Mitsubishi MultiSync LCD1550V 15: LCD Monitor are all washed out, even after adjustments were made. I was very very disappointed with this purchase and do not feel I should have to pay for return shipping. In addition, while it is a minor matter, your advertisement stated that the monitor was white, and the picture shown is white, but what I received was your typical ""computer"" putty colour. This was just a bad experience all the way around."
2,Maybe just a lemon??,"Failed right out of the box. Backlite uneven... screen darker towards the top 1/3 regardless of viewing angle. Screen/image started fluttering badly after just a few minutes. NEC tech. support's conclusion... DOA. However, in the few minutes it did work it was obvious that the speed of the screen was quite good in comparison to the LCD1530V. But furthermore, unless this particular unit was really screwed-up even when it did work, the LCD1530V has much better brightness and VERY EVEN backliting and a much better physical build quality... it just doesn't have the speed."
4,"""New"" X-Static!","Dance-rock at it's best (no, it's not a 'disco' album...) with bonus tracks from the Buddah Records version of this CD. Featuring the signature song ""Wait For Me"" it's only a wonder why their bonus track ""Time's Up (Alone Tonight)"" wasn't released as a single. Even more curious is why radio stations ignored it... It's as fine a crafted song as any Hall & Oates have ever done.Other best cuts include ""Portable Radio"", ""Bebop/Drop"", ""Running From Paradise"" (also appearing as an extended version on a 12"" single), ""Number One"" and the other bonus track ""No Brain, No Pain"", which was originally on the ""B"" side of the ""Wait For Me"" single."
4,Hall and Oates fans must have,"Okay. I have nostalgia for this album--I admit it. Some songs are just a part of my life's soundtrack. I wondered whether the songs would hold up. Good news. Not only do the songs hold up, but there is some real magic here."
5,Learn at the feet of the master,"If anyone knows about success principles, it's Jack Canfield. This book is a terrific guide to creating a successful life. If you want to learn at the feet of the master, you'll pick up this book!"
3,The Success Principles,"I did not rate this book a success. Not for me anyway. Section 5 Success and Money was by far the most interesting chapter. The rest of the book I had read before by other well known authors. I felt there was nothing new. Principles from The Secret, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz and a number of other authors came out time and again. I was just disapointed with having read it all before."
4,"Comprehensive, practical advice","Jack Canfield is a wildly successful and well-connected man, and he can't help but remind the reader of this fact in almost every chapter of this book. However, I felt that he and Janet Switzer created this book with the best of intentions. Of all of the leadership books I've read recently, this is the one with the most take-home, take-to-work practical advice. All of what is presented here is common sense, yet it's written in such a way that it's easy to understand and apply to life--today. I find myself going back to individual chapters as I seek guidance in particular areas. There is also an extensive resource list. If you can look past the references to Mr. Canfield's mansion in SoCal, I highly recommend this book."
5,Getting where you want to go!,"Jack has a way of saying things that hit home and if you are able to let this information in and take action, you are guaranteed success! This is one of the most helpful audio programs I have listened to all year. And I listen to lots of them. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is truly serious about achieving their goals."
5,"The Consolidation of all things ""Success""","Stories, Inspiration and Pragmatism... The laws of success consolidated into a pretty thick book. It's not the type of book that you just can't put down. It's the type of book that you can't afford to not pick up. Use this as a handbook, not a weekend read. Use this as a daily devotional, not a vacation enhancement. That's my piece."
5,Excellent Book,"If you are looking to increase your life, this is the book for you. Whether it is money, personal relationships, overcoming past hardships, this book will have something for everyone. I recommend it to all my friends and my life and money have greatly improved since I picked it up. You owe it to yourself to read it!"
5,Love this book,Love Jack Canfield. Love this book - a great blend of spirituality and business...or using mindfulness in business...
5,The Success Principles... A Must Read!,"This book is incredible. Very easy to read. The principles shared in this book have made a tremedous, positive impact in my personal life as well as in my business. Definately, a book that will remain in my library. This book is not a one time read, but it is a book that you will want to reference from time to time. Thank you, Mr. Canfield, for sharing these principles with the world."
3,Jack's book,"It has been over a year since I read this, I really can't tell you if I liked it or not. Sorry"
1,Did not receive all of my order,I received a book and no CDs or carrying case. I was very disappointed. I looked forward to listening to these motovational cds in my car. When I contacted the Goodwill and they did refund my account. I am still waiting for a prepaid return mailing label.
3,"If you want to learn the standards, here you go.","This recommendation is based on having read dozens of books in this genre and taking thorough notes.If you want to learn the standards, here you go."
2,Can be overwhelming,"If you want some real instruction on Success Principles, read some Brian Tracy. Not impressed with this read."
3,Section 49 is the Meat and Potato,"I read somewhere someone says that this book is the modern version of ""Think and Grow Rich"" I can't really agree with it becuase I have not read ""Think and Grow Rich""I stopped by at the local library one day checking out Chicken Soup books and saw this new book and borrowed it. Read through it and like very small section of it. Yes from the title you can tell section 49 is my favorite and it is about Heart Talk. Much similar to what Paul and Layne Cutright taught in their training for couples or anyone who is in relationship.I dont really care for the rest of the book. It's very generic information like setting goals and etc.If you get only 1 idea out of any book it's worth the reading. I got mine from this book !!!One other thing I recommend before I let you go:Get the Audio book of the Chicken Soups, much better than the book, you can play it at the bed time ~"
3,Good book,"The book was delivered on time, i would say even fast. The dust cover is good, but i was a bit unpleasantly surprised that the book cover itself is blank, just white and that's it. the rest of the pages are good."
5,Another five star review for Jack's book!,Jack knows more about success then most people in corporate America - and he will show you how if you care to read. he shows a simple process and it works.Another book that really floored me because of the process it has and the layout is a unique re-visit to a classic - I use it everyday and it is working already - its 100% fantastic:Path To Prosperity - Mastery Of Destiny - Acres Of Diamonds: The Personal Study EditionSee you at the top!
5,Success and wellbeing take time and effort,"""Attitude is Everything"" says Keith Harrell in his book. Jack Canfield elaborates about that throughout the pages of his book as he lays out his 64 Success Principles. Learn the basics of success -- ""reject rejection""; think positively; overcome your self-defeating beliefs, fears and habits; don't settle for second best; set your goals, and find someone who can help you achieve these goals; etc, etc. Anyone who is serious about getting ahead in his or her life needs to get this book and keep it among other MUST HAVESOther readings I recommned:1. Anything by Jack Canfield2.You were born rich: Now you can discover and develop those riches3.The Secret"
5,Jack Canfield The Success Principles,"Great book! I bought it used but you would never know it! amazon has a great set up and it is really hard for me to shop for books in stores now.This book really focuses on our personal responsibility for our own happiness & success. Success just doesn't happen, YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!Very happy with the whole process.!"
4,Jack Canfield book is awesome,"This Jack Canfield book is awesome. It shows you everything what it takes to success at any level, any field. i'm sure no one will regret this purchase."
5,This is the Meat and Potatoes not just Chicken Soup,"I never was greatly fond of the Chicken Soup series--they were too Reader's Digesty to me. But this book is different. I was finally persuaded by high recommendations from several friends at once. I am a board-certified cognitive behavioral therapist so for those coming into my office seeking help, I first give them my own book BRAINSWITCH OUT OF DEPRESSION. Then after the veil of darkness is finally lifted at last I suggest this book next for fine- tuning a new way of life."
5,Amazing Book!,"By name, if you are living anywhere in the world, you should have heard of Jack Canfield and read at least one of his books. This is the book that takes you by the hand and shows you how to live your dreams. It is practical and profound. It is easy to follow, yet full of depth.Jack Canfield is the greatest, 'how to get from here to there', teacher I've ever read. If you don't have this book in your library, then get it. Then, once you get it, don't read it. Devour it. Get it in your heart. It will transform your life when you apply the Success Principles Jack reveals.Amazing book! Sure to be, if not already, classic!Michael Murphy[...]"
2,low quality compared to other authors,"I got this book a couple months ago. It is a mixture of logical principles on how to be succesful with the major principle being ""Set Goals"".You could get Earl Nightingale's tapes for free on the internet that will tell you this and much more.Half this book is filled with this phrase: ""When I wrote Chicken Soup for the Soul, which became a multimillion bestseller..."", again and again and again.This book reads like a big advertisement to Chicken Soup for the Soul ""And now we have a CSFTS fom Farmers and one for Pets and one for Mothers..."".It is boring and slowly paced.Anyway, Jack Canfield belongs to the Bob Proctor school, so I guess it should make more sense to read Bob Proctor instead, or James Artur Ray which is his best student."
5,Awesome!,I have been a fan of Jack Canfield since I read the One Minute Millionaire. This book is phenomenal! His principles for success have been just what I needed to get me going. Buy it! It's so worth it!
4,Dated but very solid information.,I found this CD to have very solid information on self improvement even though it seemed a bit dated when considering The 8th Habit by S.Covey and some of the more recent materials I have encountered through Toastmasters.
5,The BEST Ever Book ON Creating Abundance!,"Hi,I am a life coach and therapist. Many of my clients seek help with creating abundance and love in their lives. I refer them to this new book by Jack Canfield. It is well put together, well researched, and it gives my clients something to study when we are not in session. Many of 'The Secret' forerunners are caught up in greed. Jack Canfield is not one of these. He sincerely wants to help others to have a better life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to create more abundance in their lives.Whitneay T. Vanwells"
5,Simple but very powerful concepts to follow,He does a great job of laying out proven concepts in a simple to follow manner. The chapters are short which makes it easy to do the exercises. If you are ready to make a change this book will definitely help.
3,Nice purchase.,"At first I was dazzled by the aura of the book. It has incredible advice I've been following. Nonetheless, sometimes Jack Canfield seems too cocky and false. I lost interest at some point. If you can read it with an objective mind, you'll learn awesome tools that will help you prosper."
5,Everyone should Have This Book,"First I would like to say we have tried everything to take our company to the next level, we ordered a copy for every employee and held weekly workshop on the book. Within the first week huge changes started happening. The biggest change with our managers was attitude, they walked different, they talked different, they performed different. I have been give new hope through his book. I know that we just needed the tools to have a focus and a vision. Thank you Jack for saving us.!! I expect profits to triple, as in the first month sales have went through the roof.! It's amazing."
2,Information Overload,"Though Canfield makes some good points and presents some important information in this book, there's just too much here, a lot of it unnecessary, even boring. Many anecdotes, personal stories, and stories of others could have, and should have, been left out. While reading the book, I often felt as if I were simply just indulging Canfield while he talked about himself. The book is also suspiciously similar to the Har-Money Cards, which have been out for at least ten years. If you want 64 prosperity principles presented simply and eloquently, get the Cards, and don't waste days with Canfield's book."
5,Right on!,"It is very informative and it did spoke of what needs to be done step by step to succeed. But as you all know there are allways barriers sometimes from your Family, demands on the responsibility that either you comply or you risk loosing what you got going on. One day maybe I find the way to overcome those traps.. good luck to all of you. This audio material is simply great..."
5,Love it,Surely an Encyclopedia of Ideas.Your Life Journey will be very Meaningful after Reading and apply the concepts.Basic Ideas but far reaching opportunities.Good Value for your Money
5,Should Be Required Reading in Our Schools,"Jack's principles resonate deep within my soul. As I read this, I couldn't help wishing I knew this information many years ago while in school. Chapter 1 - taking 100% responsibility - is the key to get deeper into the other principles. The principles build off of and compliment one another. I love hearing Jack's personal stories about how he worked so hard to get Chicken Soup for the Soul published and DID NOT GIVE UP until his goal was realized. This is an outstanding book by an outstanding man. Inspirational, substantive, enlightening.David[...]"
4,The Success Principles: How to get from where you are to where you want to be,Overall a good book - may turn off a few people with the 'be the best you can be' items but the principles are good
1,The Success Principals a disappointment!,"I must admit a slow read to say the least. The pearls of wisdom claimed by other reviewers are nothing of the sort. What Jack Canfield presents in this textbook sized wisdom writing are 64 principals that are not principals at all but rhetoric regurgitated from a thousand cliché stories told a thousand different times. This is a new age book with new age thought I would have thought better could come from the creator of such inspiration as the stories in the Chicken Soup Series.Jack Canfield has prepared a real disappointment for his audience in this book. From the visualization techniques to the positive energy mumbo jumbo ones money would be better served to feed the homeless this holiday season. If you have been one of the unfortunate people to have purchased this book don't lose heart, it will make a great door stop for your imaginary million dollar bath room or your real one for that matter."
5,Success Principles,I love this book. This book has everything you need to have a successful live. I had this book but it got left behind when I moved. Then I bought earlier but a friend so I gave it to her and bought me another copy. A must have for anyone who wants to succeed.
5,Great self-help book,"This book is easy to read and laid out in away that is easy to make use of the information. The ideas are great, with lots of real life examples. I also listened to the version on CD and that is also a great way to digest the information. But I recommend reading it too, because it was exercises throughout the book to examine how the principles can work in your own life. I wish everyone used these principles in their lives. The world would be a better place!"
5,Welcome to Success University,"Simply put this book is a Game-changer.. if you apply it. Broken down in easy-to comprehend sections from determining your goals and visions, to mapping out game plans, and keys to persistence and motivation. Many great examples.. i have re-read and referenced this book numerous times. Great for anyone that feels that they haven't found their passion or bliss.. Would have been nice to read this at even an earlier point in my life. I have purchased copies for friends and family that could use a boost! Anyone and everyone can relate and reap the benefits of this great inspiration."
5,Very interesting book.,"This is what I call interesting. Very good book. My brother-in-law has recommended this book to me, and I will recommend this book to all my family and friends."
4,This Karaoke CD doesn't show words on screen,"I got my DREAM GIRLS CD very quickly - thanks for the turn around time but I am dissappointed that it doesn't show words on the screen when I put it in my karaoke machine. Is this a defect, or is this just accompaniment music because it is advertised as ""karaoke""But I like the artists voices that sing the songs, they have some useful techniques, and the CD has a good sound quality - I'd just like the words on the screen."
2,Glad it is underneath where no one sees it.,"I bought this because it was built by Magnaflow and the other two reviewers gave theirs a nice read up, but I am not going to say it meets my idea of a Magnaflow and certainly doesn't look like the picture. For being stainless, mine has stains around each and every weld including lots of little stains across the face and back. They do send you a little Magnaflow decal to go on it but if I were the owners of Magnaflow I wouldn't want my sticker on this. I am going to take a picture of this thing and send it to Amazon to see what they think before I spend the money to have it installed. Shouldn't I expect it to at least look like the photo? Will it sound any better than it looks?"
2,Osmond Brothers Greatest Hits,No reflection on the Osmond Brothers' talents. They're great and they sing great but the reproduction on this album is scratchy and hard on the ears.
2,Sad recording,"The saddest part of this recording is that Fruma-Sarah is completely cut out of Tevye's Dream. Why? Add to that that the songs Tradition, Matchmaker and Sunrise, Sunset are nearly cut in half. Anthony Newley's vibratto nearly kills you in Anatevka and he warbles through half of Sunrise, Sunset. There is hardly anything to jump for joy about as far as the singing goes. The orchestration is nice, though, the music jumps out at you, but why cut half the songs and one major character out (and make the song, therefore, not make any sense at all?)"
4,pretty god,I had a hard time with the fantasy/ metaphors / reality but ended up loving it. interested in reading more and more.
2,Una novela pesada,"Esta novela parece escrita por una adolescente un pelín pedante que, tras leer a García Márquez o a Isabel Allende, decide que quiere ser escritora. Me ha parecido una historia muy infantil, de un realismo mágico muy forzado y con una sobreutilización de figuras que adornan la prosa (como poner el adjetivo antes que el sustantivo). Aunque la historia que cuenta podría ser bonita, la escritora la hace un poco pesada por lo que parece ser un afán de demostrar lo bien que escribe, la cantidad de vocabulario que sabe emplear y lo que sabe de la vida y del mundo al introducir escenarios (como la Capilla Sixtina, templos en la India) o conceptos (el amor tántrico) que en realidad no aportan nada al lector, sino una sensación de estar leyendo a alguien que necesita demostrar que posee la riqueza cultural necesaria para ser escritora."
1,Not typical Ted Heath,"I was very disappointed in this collection of Ted Heath recordings. It appears they are all very old, and none are in stereo as far as I've thus far seen. I am a big fan of anything recorded by Heath from '60 to more recent, but I doubt I will ever listen to these recordings. Low fidelity, and certainly not the typical Ted Heath sound."
3,Simplistic,"Very much a beginners book. Many of the items included are just common sense (drink plenty of water before you play). Covers the mental aspect and offers tips and drills. Meant to be put in your golf bag as a reference guide I assume, yet offers no index or table of contents to allow for a quick on the course reference."
3,An OK Little Primer,A good little pocketbook on how to putt. Nothing special but a nice book to have in your pocket whilst pracing.
1,Worst grill ever,"The so called stainless steel construction including burners is not so. Burners rusted through in less then one year. Hard to get replacements.Buy a Ducane at Home Depot, best deal there."
4,When Your Time Is Up,"This book is not for the timid, if the idea or sight of disease, mutilation & death bug you, then don't bother. If otherwise you find the subject matter fascinating or educational then this is a must have! Very Graphic & Descriptive. To those (you know who you are, ENJOY!)"
3,Not as detailed or informative as I expected.,I had issues with initially loading the CD-ROM and with viewing the entire images. Many images grainy and out of focus. Very brief and/or vague captions left much to be explained. Seems to exist merely for petty shock value. Some images appeared in more than 1 category. Not an appropriate reference tool.
2,intuition razor,"Pros: leaves legs smooth and nick freeCons: The soap melts way too fast, after about three uses the soap is lower than the razor. This leaves you to frequently change the blades which are way overpriced. I found it to be bulky as well and hard to get around the ankle area."
1,Odd and weird,"I seldom turn off a DVD half way into the material, but this was just too much for me. I was not alarmed by it, it just didn't capture my interest. The first part of the film lingers on the dressing and undressing of a man who happens to have multiple missing limbs. The film is in French and the pronunciation and enunciation is hard if the viewer is not a native speaker; this is complicated by the poor sound quality. The two central characters are rather bland and uninteresting and I just didn't come to care about them enough to care how they worked out a relationship between the object and and the younger man who is fascinated with a limbless man. Clumsy and slow moving, this is not that engaging film with a raw edge that I expected."
5,Awesome Christmas Music,I have over 80 Christmas CD's and I've been looking for this one for a reasonable price. Finally found it with Amazon. The Osmonds know how to make great Christmas music. My only disappointment is that there aren't more songs on it.
4,A nice break,"I found this graphic novel to be a change from standard Empire vs. Rebels. Instead it's Empire vs. Empire, which get's very interesting. Speaking of interesting, Trachta's (Grand Moff Trachta, the leader of the attempted coup) plot to overthrow the Sith was very. An unusaul thing for a Grand Moff to be doing, but anyway. The new characters were excellently done (Trachta, Kadir, Gauer). Very good art by Ryan Benjamin improved the rating to 4 stars. The only minus to Betrayal was the shortness. Could have been a lot longer (and a lot better). A good read."
5,A Man Who Changed the World,In this excellent biography we see how one man changed the course of history by preaching the truth in love. Before watching this DVD I had no idea of the commanding presence of Billy Graham and how powerful a simple message of hope could be. What is really amazing is how many countries he traveled to and how God opened doors for him to preach all over the world. The world would truly be a very different place without Billy Graham. I was humbled and blessed after watching this film about his life. You will be amazed at how many famous people's lives were changed because they spoke to Billy Graham. What an amazing life! My father was also an evangelist and traveled to many of the same countries to preach in the open air. While my father didn't talk about Billy Graham I have a feeling that he was deeply influenced by his life.~The Rebecca Review
3,Billy Graham: God's Ambassador,"This DVD was supposed to arrive in 3-5 days, but it took over 3 weeks. So I couldn't give it as a Christmas gift. I will never buy from Amazon again."
5,"Billy Graham--Friend, Humble, Healthy & Spokesman for God","Billy and Ruth Graham are portrayed through news media clips as well as personal family photos in many geographical settings that show Billy as a world's statesman. The film is gripping and moving through the decades from Truman to current President, Bush, giving clear understanding of the true humility and concern for individuals throughout the Earth regardless of their political or personal views. The film uses news media objectivity that lends to credibility of this documentary. Its appeal will cross all religious and non religious persuasions."
4,great for the price,"i bought this guitar in black about 8 months ago and fell in love with it. for the price the tone is awsome and its just a nice feel because the body is not big at all. with the price tho there are some drawbacks...action isnt the greatest at both the nut and the higher frets but average i'd say. u can adjust it if u know a thing or 2 about guitars. no pickups on it for acoustic electric, just a mic somewhere in there. great if u plug in and want pure clean sound its real nice but dont use it as an electric, there's soo much fuzz if u plug it to a pedal that it sounds like hell if ur not strumming since so much feedback. but yeah, for a starter guitar or just to have a nice easy player i definitely recommend...4 stars overall, but under 100 definitely 5 stars, one i'd recommend to anyone."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"I bought this product for my beginning guitar learning boyfriend.After I received the package I went to a shop so they could tune the guitar for me. They told me that the while tuning they stripped a bolt because the tuners were really cheap. They also said the bridge while, sturdy, was not going to hold up well while tunning because the placement was bad. They said that this type of guitar would probably hold up about 6 months.When I got home I looked at the guitar bag and the zipper was broken!Is it worth the +$80 I've already put into it? I don't think so!"
1,WOW!!,"hey i purchased this just before christmas and all i can say is WOW!! this guitar sucks!!! besides the entire neck being bent and the extreme amount of tension that is currently ripping the bridge and the neck off the body, the play on this is terrible! notes are killed easily and the tones are way off. i am sorry i spent my money on this. but would should i expect from a guitar at only $79. like a saying goes in my country (Trinidad)....""good ting no cheap and cheap ting no good"""
2,No worth the price,"The guitar is bad quality, the tuners are really weak, I don't recommend this guitar unless you cant pay more. By the way, the guitar does not come with the tuner. The guitar should be cheaper, for what they offer."
3,"Interesting, but...","Author Magrs manages to weave an intersting story, but where he fails is in his experimentation with plot devices that are simply not Doctor Who. Also, his exageration of the Pertwee era Doctor went beyond farsical and comes across more as silly. In addition, while the Iris Wildthyme character is intersting, she breaks the cardinal rule of Doctor Who, in that she quite often steals the spotlight. A major no no. A good story that would have worked without all the trappings. Borrow a copy from the library instead of investing in the work."
2,Doesn't fit very well.,"Though this product is advertised as a replacement for broken mirror glass for the passenger mirror on Nissan Pathfinders manufactured between 1996 and 2004, it does not fit well at all on my 2000 Pathfinder. The replacement glass is considerably smaller than the old glass and the assembly. Thus, there is a big gap all around the mirror glass now. This will probably not affect the performance, but it is unsightly. If you're looking for an exact fit, go to the dealer."
5,BEST EVER FOR MULTIPULE REASONS,"With a small ice cube tray, you can freeze baby food and give it to them...... it helps SO much for teething, and also you really don't have to struggle to get them to eat! My son didn't even need to be taught how to use this! I was amazed and he's been using them twice a day for two weeks now! It's been a teething life saver as it helps keep him from being too grumpy. LOVE this, must buyCali mom of 2 :)"
1,No replacements,"We bought this one for my first child. Loved it cause he could eat in the car without getting food all over in the back seat. Was great also cause he could feed himself...BUT i hated with every fiber of my being cleaning it. ITS HORRIBLE. I got it back out with my second child and there was no way i was using it again. (they are really close in age)I was at babys r us and found the sassy brand kind and it comes with replacement bags...so they come out, making it soooo much easier to clean. And once they get too nasty to give back to them, you put a new bag in. I would never recommend this one anyone. But obviously i would recommend the other brand."
1,choking hazrd,"hi, just wanted to make you aware of a hazard on this product. the Munchkin fresh food feeder that i purchased had a small piece of different colored plastic on the locking part. this came off while my daughter was using it and she started to choke on it. luckily we were able to dislodge the piece and she's okay, but make sure yours doesn't have this part. I contacted the company and told them of the problem but i noticed the new feeder in the stores still have this hazard."
4,Great for teething...,"As a speech language pathologist I knew about these feeders long before I had a child of my own. My daughter has loved sucking and chewing on frozen fruit to ease her teething pain. I have to admit these are extremely difficult to clean and like another reviewer I tried banana first... what a nightmare to wash! On all of my subsequent trials I used frozen fruit (melon, strawberries, and peaches. The frozen fruit tended to make less of a mess and it was hilarious to watch my daughter cring at the cold and then go back for more (kinda like watching you lil' one devour a wedge of lemon). I personally liked the feeder, but definitely pay attention when cleaning it!"
3,Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder,Giving this a 3 star because I bought this when my baby was about 4 months and a 1/2 and still could not hold it well. Also I find it hard to clean. Great idea but not working for my baby too well. Item was in great condition when received. We will keep trying as she get older and see how it work out.
1,unnecessary and kinda gross,"the baby doesn't like the plasticky texture, she is much better off eating the new fruits from a stick. also the mesh is so fine that really only juice comes through. this is a gross product and a little over paranoid."
1,Cannot get clean,"No matter how to try to clean the mesh. It will NOT. Fresh fruit, especially bananas, will leave food particles in the mesh. Bags are non-replaceable. Great concept, but change the bag to silicone and make it removable."
4,A Must for Your Library,"This book was very methodically formatted. Contents include: Field Study of Mushrooms and other fungi; Conditions under which musrooms grow and thrive (very extensive including illustrations of different species and photographs); Forest Types; Low to collect, study and prepare; Life History and General Characteristics; Economic Importance of Fungi; Common Edible Mushrooms and How to Cook; Growing Mushrooms; Poisonous Mushrooms; Literature on Mushrooms and their Allies (extensive reference); Systematic account of selected larger fungi; Bibliography; Technical Terms; and Nomenclatural Changes.Mr. Louis C.C. Krieger has done extensive research in easy to understand reference book. While other books might be more helpful for regional usage, this is book provides a thorough overview."
5,A lovely book,"Like the last Wodehouse anthology I read (and the first Wodehouse book I had taken the time to read) this book is a splendid collection of humorous stories by Wodehouse, all of them really first rate. However, where the Bestiary only had one or two samples of each of the different ""genres"" of Wodehouse this one has grouped several into chapters. It really is a marvelous book!"
2,Not my thing,"I only read the first short story, but I didn't like it. It was mildly funny at best. I didn't even bother with the rest after that. Maybe some of his other works are better, but I was not going to waste my time finding out."
5,A Great Introduction to Wodehouse,"""The Most of P.G. Wodehouse"" was the first book of his that I've read, but you can be sure that it won't be the last! Though Wodehouse was first brought to my attention because of the Jeeves stories, I started in with the Drones Club and was immediately hooked. This book is hysterical. Who knew there were so many things in life to place bets on?!Having read other short story collections in the past, I was ready for the typical couple thousand word stories that were good, but not exceptional by and large. Wodehouse's short stories, however, are brilliant.This collection is fantastic. It's perfect for those times when you just want a quick, entertaining, light read. My wife always knew when I was reading this book because I couldn't stop laughing."
5,Attempting the Impossible,"The best distillation I've found of Wodehouse's amazing body of work. Great introduction to his variety of characters and situations. One of the few authors that can make me laugh out loud, even on the second or third reading."
1,this book needed a proof reader,"Even if this were a first edition, which is not, there are too many egregous errors that should have been caught before this book went to the printer. If this is the only book being used by a student, if the examples don't work, the student might not realize that it the book's fault, not theirs. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,"Good for beginners, but not for serious study of Java","This book is good for people who are beginners to programming with its simple style, but it should not be used for serious study of Java programming. This book does not cover Java in detail enough for you to use it for serious study. Beginners should use this text as a precursor to Java - How to Program and professionals should use this as a reference book. This book is more like a summary of the key features of Java. The price should be reduced to more like $19.99US."
2,safety pin earrings,"These earrings are very cute, but very small and thin. They are hard to remove from your ears without bending the earrings. I don't think they will last long before they break. If they were a little larger and move durable, they would be perfect."
1,"Obvious advice, borring, full of it, etc...","I can't believe this got good reviews. If you want some obvious advice from a guy who loves to dish it out. This guy is so fake and full of it. Maybe if he would tone it down a little I would have gone for it, but I don't buy it."
3,Fast Shipping,The chrome finish is not as good as I expected it to be. I will have to re-chrome or purchase different rails later.
1,i did not like this book at all.,"it is not intended for travelers, but for expad, or for pepole intending to move to beijing"
1,Missing too much,"Most of these idiot reviewers are missing the fact that this CD is missing lot of songs which define Extreme. The implication that it is a ""Best of"" and not a ""Greatest Hits"" should have included more from their self-titled album. Tsk-tsk, this doesn't include ""Mutha (Don't Wanna Go to School Today)"", how can that be?"
1,Stampede. High school production.,"Music and singing is excellent.However, production is a complete trash.I am the music lover and I can not listen to massive noise and distraction even during beautiful arias. There is lot of running, stomping, door slamming, chairs throwing and other noise making activities. Musicians and singers effort is ignored."
2,So disappointing!,"This production is, alas, a typical example of the ways in which ""regieoper"" can interfere with and ultimately destroy the historical and cultural value of a work--thus depriving audiences new to Meyerbeer any chance to come to terms with the music and the drama as it was meant to be understood. The staging and costumes don't make any sense. And to compound the problem, many of the singers are well below par, and the orchestra lacks fire.After two acts I gave up and opted to buy the Sutherland version from Australian National Opera instead. The grande dame is past her prime in that production, which dates from 1989, but she could still sing quite well and carried herself like the majestic diva she always was (and this fits her part in the opera). The ANO production gives you a chance to experience the opera on its own terms, for better or worse."
3,forced modernization,"I am not impressed with this DVD. Directors are trying to modernize good old operas without success. I have asked many colleagues (opera funs) and they all prefer classical representations. Besides, it was translated into German from the original French (for which it was written). The voices are usually weak (although there are exceptions). I am waiting for a better DVD of this beautiful opera."
3,At times an interesting Read.,"This was a pretty good book on James Longstreet. Will you learn anything new? Not really! Will any of your questions about the Longstreet controversy be answered? Again no! But it is a well written overview of Longstreet and the war. You could do better, you could do worse."
2,Who is to blame for Gettysburg ?,"Historians since 1865 have blamed General James Longstreet for the Confederacy losing the Battle at Gettysburg. This book places the blame on Robert E Lee, which after reading this book as well as other books recently, I would tend to agree with that assumption. The writer seems to be a Longstreet fan though, and seems to add to Longstreet's capability as a General, while placing the blame for several Confederate losses on General Stonewall Jackson which I do not agree with at all. In essence, the writer's purpose of the book is to clear Longstreet's name at the expense of Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson, as well as other Generals that Longstreet came in contact with during the Civil War. Unfortunately the author feels that is the only way to clear Longstreet's name."
5,A well written biography,"General James Longstreet has long been one of my favorite Civil War Generals so when I came across this book I just had to have it. Mr Wert is a gifted writer and historian who leads the reader through Longstreets early childhood and education to his life at the Military Academy into his military career and his late political life. Mr Wert tells of his successes and failures, of the battles he won and the ones he lost. as well as his disagreements with other Generals and Confederate leaders. As someone else has stated you well learn nothing new here, You will find a well written biography without bias or editorial comment about one of the greatest civil was generals. I feel this is a must read for any civil war buff or any who is interested in learning more about this era of our history."
4,The forgotten general,Wert does an excellent job of informing us as to why Lee considered Longstreet his old war horse. It's been over 135 years. Let's forget the postwar criticisms and focus on the actual contributions of one of the South's finest generals.
4,Polishes Longstreet Right Up,"This, and The Killer Angels (and Gettysburg) have gone a long way towards restoring this man's reputation. Often stubborn, slow, sometimes forgetful, the man is still a great General. One of the great injustices of the day was him shouldering the blame for Gettysburg, which was clearly Lee's doing. This book, a little dry, but the best modern volume on Longstreet, clears that up; but it also doesn't shy away from his later life, revealing how *selective* an old man's memory can be."
4,Very enlightening biography of misunderstood man.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. After reading ""Killer Angels"" this account of the life of one of the South's most misunderstood generals brought me a better understanding of the man and what he stood for. Unfortunately he was in the shadow of Lee and no one during and after the war would dare to place blame for failure on Lee directly. Longstreet was caught in a ""Catch-22."" I found this book to be very readable and recommend it to anyone interested in finding out more about the man James Longstreet"
4,Good Straight Forward History,"This is a good straight forward history of General Longstreet and the to a lesser extent the Civil War. The book takes a very favorable view of Longstreet, but at times is rough on him when it is deserved. He does the same with the other Confederate Generals, including Lee and Jackson.Wert does a fine job of describing the thinking of Longstreet and also of the other generals. He also fully discusses the strategic decisions that faced the South and the reasons that decisions were made. All, in all, it is a worthwhile read on an interesting subject."
5,Great movie,This is a great movie that is educational and entertaining. I recommend it to everyone especailly if you live in the Souteast region of the United States.
4,Good info on New Madrid Earthquakes,Used it for a geology course. A bit sensational at times but gets the message across about the threat of New Madrid earthquakes in the future.
3,Well done,DVD is well done but the video used is sometimes repeated. Quality is good and gives nice detail on earthquakes in the mid-west.
3,One time use!,"The glue works fine, it dries fast and sets in minutes. It dries with a white residue which can be seen on most materials, especially dark ones. You can only use a tube once because it becomes a hazard to transport after it's been opened. The lid doesn't stop the glue from seeping out onto it's surroundings, making it a one time use."
3,Be sure you actually get Shed Stop!,"I ordered ""Shed Stop Dog Supplement Gallon"", but Entirely Pets sent Shed Solution instead! Shed Stop is great, but disappearing from the market. Shed Stop does not contain water, but Shed Solution lists water as the first (major) ingredient. The whole point in ordering the gallon was to get it before Shed Stop was no longer available. I will return the inferior product to Entirely Pets, but what a waste of my time."
1,Hate to be a damper....,"I used this product on my dog, which is a bull boxer mix and sheds more than any dog i've ever came in contact with. Around 3 weeks into using this he started shedding the worse he ever has, and I thought maybe it'd get worse before it got better. But 5 weeks passed and things weren't better and it seemed like he was ""choking"" it down just bc I was making him eat it; so I got tired of it and quit. At least i used it for the 4 weeks it said it'd take to work!"
4,"Good, but...","While a fairly good overview of these 2 aircraft, the evaluation of their capabilities is more than a little ""soviet"" sounding. In other words these 2 development projects are described as the greatest things since sliced bread. A more objective and blunt account of their drawbacks would have made this a great book. With the extremely limited funding available and the isolated nature of these aircraft as weapons systems (as compared to the F22 which will be a fully integrated theatre weapon and probably the last US manned air superiority fighter) the compromises made by the Russian manufacturers are major and would be interesting to read about."
1,NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS TOILET SEAT!,"The directions came on the tiniest sheet of paper and only showed 2 pictures. The written section was unintelligible as were the photos. My husband had replaced many toilet seats over the years and, despite two attempts, was not able to put this on. The company claims that this new STA-TITE system is wonderful, but I will never buy a seat that has this system. THIS TOILET SEAT IS GOING BACK TO AMAZON and I appreciate the free return shipping. I have now ordered a different one from American Standard."
4,Good for Old Folks,This toilet seat really helps in that it raises the effective height of the toilet with no mechanical work needed. Only small complaint is that I couldn't get the braces tight enough to prevent the seat from shifting as one tries to rise from it.
1,"Sadly, not for me.","I'm afraid my skin was too sensitive for this, It dried me out. I gave it to my daughter to try."
5,works well,i have really bad cystic acne on mt back. ive been using it for about a week and ive noticed the cyst are going away slowly and the scares as well. the only think is that i bought 2 bottles and im on my second one already. but it does work
1,Would Not Replace Product Damaged Due Packaging,"Upon receipt, product was half empty. Cap was loose. It spilled all over the interior of box. That same day, I requested to return product. I had all the intentions to buy a replacement.Return request DENIED.Unacceptable way to treat a customer.DO NOT BUY FROM AMERICAN RX."
2,broken bottle,"When I received the bottle, the cap was broken so the bottle was half full by the time I received it."
1,Will continue to try,"Been using daily for a month and still no difference.I have 2 bottles and will continue to use until they are finished,as this was the most recommended product on the web."
4,This book is amazing worth getting for open minded possibilities and facts.,"This book is amazingly worth getting for open minded possibilities and facts that the government would'nt recommended you knowing. However, if you believe there is a control system, you will understand way beyond the matrix and understanding how it works."
5,Mind Blowing!!!,"Is simply the best book ever writen about the way reality is interpreted by our brain. It will let you realise that our reality of things are not out there but in here, in your mind!!!"
3,Too little about infinite LOVE,"The title is misleading, however the book itself is quite interesting."
3,Why continue to live the illusion if it's hurting us?,"The author's views are compelling, but I don't see how he can be wholely correct.... I mean, why are we ""stuck"" in our own creation? If this is an illusion that just isn't working for us, then why the heck are we not collectively re-creating it? I agree with some other reviewers that this book can be a painful perception of life, especially when there are no answers at hand to fix this ""reality"". Depression, feeling distanced and isolated from others who don't ""get it"", a feeling of powerlessness to effect changes... not exactly constructive feelings. If infinite love is what the author is trying to promote, he hasn't done a very good job. I believe we can change the world to make love the prominant force, but we must feel united and powerful together, rather than lost in an illusion."
3,My First Icke Book,"Okay, I have to say I enjoyed the book. However, I had some problems wading through Icke's frequent diatribes against everything on the earth (and off of it). As far as love, I'd have to say Icke's constant attacks on everything leave him sounding paranoid rather that full of love. He also seems to present his ""freeing himself"" as part of what he calls love. However, I wonder how much his ""freedom"" has actually been facilitated by selling huge quantities of books. David, my point is that it doesn't matter whether what you are saying is true or not. In my opinion, there is still only one way out, and that is surrender to the divine. This is how I define love."
2,"Illusion, Schmillusion","Evidently Mr. Icke doesn't seem to be able to grasp what reality is and, as a result, he has concocted a belief that everything -- and he means EVERYTHING -- is an ""illusion,"" except of course for what he calls ""infinite love,"" a vague expression that has little meaning. Let's use a hypothetical situation as an example:Let's say that Mr. Icke was in a bad car accident and broke both his legs, his pelvis, and was bleeding profusely from deep facial and skull abrasions, and was then rushed to the hospital and almost died as a result of the injuries he received from the accident. One would be hard-pressed to call that experience an ""illusion."" But if Mr. Icke actually believes that particular hypothetical incident would really be an ""illusion,"" like he states in his book, then I have some very lovely ocean-front property in Missouri that I'd like to sell to him."
3,Well Told History,The book was well-written and certainly well researched. It kept my interest but I probably would have preferred less detail about his captive years and more detail about his years as active King of Scotland. I was not prepared for it to end so abruptly.
3,Dover's mission furniture catalogs,Contains clean line drawings and grubby b&w photos. It is not the most interesting or attractive of Dover's many reprints of mission furniture catalogs. But it is cheap!
3,Nice book for knitting,This is a nice book to use if you are a beginner knitter. It is plainly written and easy to use. I have already made one of the patterns already!
2,Offers little as far as new or creative patterns,"Do we really need to buy a book to show us how to do a stockinette stitch scarve? While it does have a few patterns that are interesting, I found little that I would actually want to knit. Most of the patterns are very basic and really don't need a pattern for."
5,Exactly what I needed,"My friend and I are starting a little side business where we are selling custom designed scarves. This book was perfect for that. It gives great basic patterns for scarves and shows the stitches in various fancy yarns. If you are not a creative type who likes your end product to look exactly like the picture, don't buy this. If you like to try different yarns and be a little creative in your knitting, this is the perfect book for you."
2,For the Extremely New Knitter,"This book is only for the beginner. It's full of garter-stitch, drop stitch, rib and other basic stitch pattern scarves. The only thing I found interesting, that would be nice to see in other pattern books, is that for each pattern, she has a section called ""Another Yarn to Try"" where 1-3 other yarns of different fibers and/or weights are swatched in pattern. It's a good jumping off point for for beginners who are afraid of straying from exactly what the pattern calls for."
5,Wanya Morris Presents: Millennium Renaissance,Wonderful great brand new cd and it arrived on time thanks so much for the cd will do business again
3,What you WanMor?,"This is an album that is meant to use Wanyá Morris' & the Boyz II Men name to try to bring up two of Wanyá's partners who are on his then new now defunct label WanMor. Freddie Fingaz is the rapper & Will Guice is theR&B; singer. It's not great, but it's not bad. The songs I like best are 2, 3, 4 & 13. - DFull Tracklist Information:1. Intro2.

2,"Goosebumps For Dolts, I Mean Adults","I've watched three episodes so far, spread out to see if it improved after the first episode. Not really, but the actors are generally decent. The lead actor doesn't give off much charisma. Pretty much everything reminds me of episodes of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps I watched with my nephew, especially the quality of writing and direction. The stories are so thin they barely support their half-hour running time.I have no memories of this show, and it probably helps to retain a strong sense of nostalgia about it. I suffer from nostalgia more than anyone, so enjoy this all you want if you want to. I mostly wanted to point out that Beyond Reality = Goosebumps. It sells for $8.47, which sounds about right."
3,"Okay, but dated","I remember this series when it was being aired and at that time, I found it pretty cool, but ..... when you hold this up to other series that are available, it feels awful dated and seems lacking. Sheri Belafonte's hair style - I don't know what you call it except maybe 'buckethead' makes me think she was once one of the birds in the Flock of Seagulls new wave band, and did this series between takes. The acting is mediocre at it's best and the story lines are so - so. If you're into tales of the supernatural and generally like creepy stuff, check out the WB series Supernatural. Much better story lines, with continuity, and top notch special effects - plus no buckethead hairdoos."
2,Hot pink color fades fast!!!,"I really liked this item when I first got it. It arrived just as described, but after about 3 or 4 weeks the glossy hot pink color fades really bad to a nasty dry light orange color. My dog is an indoor dog, so there is no reason why it should do that. The quality of the leather is great, the spikes were nice, but the color turns very bad in a very short amount of time."
2,Thinner blade than OEM,The blades are thinner than OEM. It did present a installation issue as the blade was not thick enough to allow the mounting nut and washer to clamp the blade in place. I used a large washer in addition to the existing washer to clamp against the blade. I am not sure that the blades will last aas long as the standard thickness blade.
5,Awesome CD,This is a really cool CD! My husband bought it for me and I thought it was so cool. We listened to it all the way down to South Padre. It reminded me of the times that we used to go down to Mexico and dance. It rocks!
5,Wow!,I thought this book was excellent. I didn't think it would be....... I think this is one of a kind.
3,good personailty,"I have a good personailty and like to have fun, go out and do what ever that not boring."
4,WOW,If you like a good book with a little mystery this is a book for you. Get this book today at amazons bookstore.They have the lowest prices!
2,Not worth the money!,"This book is neither for beginners nor for advanced users. I am not sure who the target audience is. Unlike the title suggests, it does not tell you anything about upgrading to Lotus Notes/Domino 7 except for a brief overview of some of the features in the newest release. That was fine in my case, because I just wanted to learn about new ND7 features. Unfortunately, it tends to mention a feature then not go on to tell you how to implement it or how it's best used. Kinda useless! I can read the Help files and get more information than I found in this book - and that's FREE! At $59.99, you should be able to expect a LOT more for your money. Apparently there will never be an updated version of Rob Kirkland's ""Domino System Administration,"" the Notes Admin's Bible, which is a shame. I recommend saving your money and downloading individual RedPapers & RedBooks to get you acquainted with ND7. Oh yeah - and USE THE HELP FILE!"
2,Not an upgrade book,"I bought this book with the assumption that it would assist me in performing an upgrade to Domino 7. I was also looking for a book that would assist me with learning Domino 7 Administration. This book failed horribly at either of those tasks. I found it to be more of a differnces and new features book than any kind of an upgrade guide. The book is written with the assumption that you're an expert level Notes Administrator. The topics that it does cover are only covered at a summary level. It discusses what needs to be done or what could be done but not how to do it. There is only 13 pages on how to upgrade Domino 7 and it's practically useless. The entire book is only 307 pages and could be used as a reference guide once you've upgraded, however I'm sure that most if not all the information in this book can be found on the IBM website."
4,Plug and Play Sirius Boombox,"The XACT XS025 boombox is a solid performer. It is not going to win any awards for sound quality or looks but it gets the job done and it does it well. If you want to bring your commercial free radio to a party, picnic or beach, this boombox will serve you well. I was surprised I was able to listen to satellite music inside my house. The blue lighted power/volume knob is kinda cool.I like the fact that you can plug this boombox in or load it up with 700 D batteries (OK 8 D batteries - but it is pretty heavy). You can get about 4 or so hours of listening time with battery power. Good enough for a typical party. If you are going to an all-nighter, bring spares.Pros - great reception, decent sound, AC/DC option, good battery listening time, cool volume light.Cons - U-G-L-Y, heavy when loaded with batteries, clunky carrying handle."
4,"Great sound, small package","I picked this unit up at a local thrift store for the staggering amount of $10.00, new in the box, so that might color my judgment of it a little. I used the receiver in the car and swapped it in the boombox for home use, until I replaced the car unit with a Visor.For this thing's size, it puts out a fair amount of sound, and the clarity is really amazing for speakers this size, which is about 3 inches, I'd say. It won't please the audiophile in your life, but it will bring the satellite radio out of the car and into your home.It looks a little clunky and is quite heavy, especially when loaded down with batteries, but it's got a nice solid feel to it, unlike many of the current electronics out there. If you have an XAct that'll fit this, buy it. I have to take one star off for the receiver popping out on occasion, but other than that, it's a great accessory to have."
1,Not XACTly what I wanted,Played ok for a day. Then it just started randomly turning on and off by itself. Doesn't matter if it's plugged into a wall socket or running on batteries. It may look like its a radio but it's a paperweight. Thanks for nothing. The one star is for working one day maybe one day you'll get 5 stars.
1,Lack of Info,"This product maybe the best on the market, but we'll never know. This company needs to be more specific on what models of Sirius Satellite Radios that this boombox is compatible with. Unfortunately, it was not compatible with ours and had to be returned. We had no problems with returning the merchandise, but it would have saved us a lot and time and effort if we had known up front that there was a compatiblity problem."
1,The warranty is a lie,"Try calling XACT's tech support line at 866-466-9228. You'll find there is no way to talk to a live operator. If you navigate to the menu for warranty/repair information, you are only given an e-mail address [...] which you must e-mail several times to even get a response, and that reponse just says to return the item to the retailer.It XACT's reponsibility, not the retailers, to replace a defective product after 90 days, according to XACT's own warranty policy! They are shirking their responsibility and I can only conclude that their products are of such poor quality that honoring their warranty would bankrupt the company.The product of theirs that I bought was an XACT cordless headset phone (the XG2500) and its battery was useless after 9-10 months from the purchase, lasting about 10 minutes fresh off the charger. I'm putting out this one-star review as a warning to others: the products are poor and the warranty is fake."
4,It works...,"I got this set for my daughter's 3rd birthday. The quality of fabric is pretty low, but my daughter seems happy with it. I wish the top sheet was fitted at the bottom like other toddler sets we've gotten, however."
4,Fits perfect,"It fits perfect in the toddler bed, and makes my daughter want to sleep on her own bed. The nightmare is over!!!Dora the Explorer 4pc Toddler Bedding Set"
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this set for my daughter. The bedding is such a poor quality, that my daughter won't sleep in her bed. She says the sheets are itchy. The comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND this set to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,You get what you pay for,Love the topic and pleased w/ the amount of pictures. Would have liked more information. Found a couple errors so makes me wonder about the accuracy of the content. The book is cheaply made and I was appalled at how poorly it was packed and shipped. Not one for a collector but okay for reference.
3,book,"The book came in great shape, but I didn't really like the story. Still it is for high school lit, so what can you expect"
4,Just Another American Dream Crashed,"""Death of a Salesman"" was about the American Dream. Every American wants to be successful. As for Willy Loman, the main character, is never very successful of happy. Because he is never successful, he thought that it would be better for his family if he were to commit suicide. That way they would get his insurance money. The play is an example of another American dream gone wrong.I really like this play. It is very easy to read and sright to the point. The play showes that the American dream is not at all what it is cut out to be."
2,don't read if you don't want to know what happens in it,"I feel absolutely no sympathy towards Willy Loman. He was a horrible man who ruined his entire family. He treated his wife like an object, cheated on her, and was constantly telling her to shut up. He completely ignored Happy, and he tried to make Biff into something he wasn't (which subsequently made him incredibly unhappy). If that wasn't enough I honestly believe he comitted suicide just to see how many people would come to his funeral, not caring if it would devistate everyone who actually loved him (a whole 4 people!!). The only person I felt sorry for was Happy, because nobody cared enough about him to ask him who he was going to marry."
1,I never received my book.,I ordered the Book in april for a class that started in mid may never received it and had to buy another from barnes and noble.
2,Death of a Salesman is deadly,"This book was not good. Just because the play is supposedly a ""tragedy"" and is different because the tragic hero is an everyday guy (Willy Loman), doesnt make the book good. The play is basically a string of redundant emotions and feelings with little or no change in the underlying message. I would not recommend this book."
2,A story betrayed by it's author,"Maybe at the time it was written I would have reviewed it more favorably. In light of the life Miller led I can't help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play. Here Miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism, then Miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole USA: the very capitalist society that was supposedly Willy's oppressor. I think the years have taken the shine off of Miller a bit. I'm sure the Liberal 101 literature professor will disagree."
5,If you are a salesman do not read this play.,"i read this play and changed my life 360 degree. when i decided to be a salesman i asked my self what will be my future when i was like Willy Loman , i have my dream but what else to make my dream true. Willy Loman looks like any one in USA and other country, so i changed my life from sales and went to anther field, i do not know why but this play affected my life, so if you want to be a sales man do not read this play."
2,Making Sales,"I recently read this book for my Literature class and bat I remembered that I had read it before.The is a middle school level. I really enjoy reading it whith the class some times I woud loose my places but I catch on whith the rest of the class.I learn more about how to make sales and to control my temper.Not like Willy in the play he dont know how to control his temper.My father and I both are sales man.We both have a small business,Sales business run in are famaly from generation. The story gave me a better look about life as a salesman."
5,Failure of a rotten man,"I read a lot of reviews about this play, where the reviewers think of this story as a tragedy of the society. However I think of it more as a lesson of adapting to the society. The world changes and people change with it, and if one does not have the courage to adapt or even to face the reality, he is doomed of failure. One cannot blame Willy Loman's failure to the cruelty of the society when he is the one who cheated on his wife, indulged his kid of theft and mocked away good influence from his boys. Willy Loman is the victim of his own distorted world view. He lived in a house of cards constructed with ""shoeshines and a smile"", which collapsed when people stopped smiling back. He buried himself alive, and the rest of the world just watched."
2,Against Human Nature,"""Death of a Salesman"" was not the book i expected it to be when i picked it up. I admit that it was an interesting read, but I didn't think that the death of Willy was justifiable. I guess you could call me optimistic but usually when you discover that a love that you thought was gone forever returns into your life, it wouldn't push you to commit suicide. Despite the circumstances,I could not connect with the logic at all. Even in the mind of a crazy man; it seems that his peace with Biff was everything he had ever hoped for...so why give up. i think that Willy was a coward, and a false example of what even the most broken men would do under such circumstances."
1,Death of a Salesman,"I ordered Death of a Salesman by Arther Miller and received The Crucible by Arther Miller. The note said it was ""part of my order"". I guess I'll be getting the book I ordered soon. =)I wonder?"
1,This play is too sad to be enjoyed.,"""Death of A Salesman"" by Arthur Miller confirmed my disliking for Arthur Miller. After reading ""The Crucible,"" I thought perhaps I didn't care for Miller's take on history, but this play showed that I just don't care for him as a playwright. I found the characters in both plays strikingly similar in their attitudes. I've also come to the conclusion that Miller was truly a sad soul who couldn't put joy into his plays. I could not feel for any of the characters and by the end of the play, I felt empty and confused. I usually can visualize a play in my mind while reading it - but this time, nothing came to mind. Just blankness and blandness. I do not recommend."
2,Dumb,"I thought this play, to its entirety, was outlandish. It was totally nonessential; some episodes were difficult to understand. It threw me off in the beginning when Ben, Willy's brother, came into the picture and all of a sudden left. I soon came to realize that it was a flashback. I thought the book was a repeat, which became predictable, and extremely boring. In few words, I could summarize this play: Willy and Linda fight; Willy is disappointed in his sons; Biff tries and fails at getting a job from Oliver; Willy is released from his job; Biff and Willy get into a huge fight at their house; Willy kills himself. As a result, Death of a Salesman was a waste of my time and I highly encourage you not to spend your precious time reading this play."
1,Death of a Saleman from a Different Perspective,"I do not normally read such books as this but in school we were assigned to read it. While reading this play I realized the time it was written in and accepted the poor dialogue as a way to show the period of time. Also, the reoccuring display of flasbacks was a tedious yet effective way of showing Willy Lomans inability to accept himself as a failure as is his sons. One more thing, the women being showed as either prostitutes or as inferior housewifes was demeaning to women. The play was good in terms of the theme it showed and how we as humans prefer not to accept the reality of our lives but to choose American dream illusions to make ourselfs feel like we are well liked or well known but other than that I would have to rate it as a one star play."
3,if you're interested...,"The drama ""Death of a Salesman"" by Arthur Miller is about the unsuccesful fate of the Loman family, their desperate struggle to achieve a good living and the final attempt of Willy Loman, the mentally disturbed father of the family, to achieve their goal by sacrificing himself.The drama takes up the thesis of the American Nightmare, the dark side of a system offering everybody to become succesful just because of skill and hard labor. It describes the life of a family whose disadvantage is the lack of social security. The drama succeeds in creating a vivid image of a long hidden side of U.S. life. Overall it is a drama easy to read and understand, which leaves a lot of interpretation to the reader by only hinting at many points."
3,Death Of A Salesman,"When I read this play, I didn't like it at all. I didn't even like the story line. I don't think it has much of a point to it except for some hidden concepts about the American Dream that half of our society wouldn't even understand. The movie was a little better, just because it was easier to follow and understand. You didn't have to be confused and think so hard about it. While it does include information about the American Dream, it does give the reader enough to enjoy it a little. I like it to an extent, but not enough to consider reading it again. The main thing I liked about the play and movie was the relationship between Biff and Willy. The two got together and the drama started, they were so much alike that they were incompatible."
4,"""Death of a Salesman"" movie vs book","""Death of a Salesman"" by Arthur Miller is a well developed, well thought out play. Dustin Hoffman made it that much better in the movie version. He plays Willy Loman, the main character,who is going senile. He continuously has flashbacks about his past with friends and family. I liked the movie better than the play itself. I think the play was wonderfully written with a lesson, ""don't always follow your insticts, sometimes friends have better advice."" The play ""Death of a Salesman"" was more confusing to interpret what was going on because there were so many different things going on at once and the reader has to visualize what is going. In the movie, it's right there so viewers can understand it."
4,Perhaps Suggests Improbability of the American Dream,"Willy Loman, the name itself, has become an icon in American culture and language. Arthur Miller's creation lives in his dreamworld in which persoanlity and a smile can carry anyone to the top. Willy's sons--Biff, his favorite; and Happy (or Hap)--have never achieved the success which Willy has hoped for them. After an encounter in Boston in which Biff discovers that his father, Willy, is a ""fake, a phony"", we the reader discover that Willy has yet to find who he is. America has produced a limited number of great dramatists and their works should be read by all."
5,"Good service, good product.","The book came fast, and it came it very good shape. It is my summer reading book and I am looking foward to reading it."
2,Groan,"If ""attention must be paid,"" proceed with caution.Artie Miller's lauded play is pretentious bunkum.For Miller the American Dream is boring everyoneto death on the installment plan."
2,Boring,"I read Death of a Salesman simply for pleasure as I like to read the odd 'classic' that I didn't read in high school without the bias of teacher/intellectuals 'breathing down my neck'.However, the story of a 'loser' did not appeal to me and I felt no sympathy for the character or his family throughout the story. I fail to see why this is called a 'classic'. Who decides this? I would hate to impose this book on high school students."
3,"well, I suppose it must be all right","because it gets me so annoyed. Anything vivid enough to truly bug me the way that this play did has to have at least a little merit. Arthur Miller is pretty depressing, though, and it's my opinion that DEATH OF A SALESMAN is even worse than THE CRUCIBLE in this department. The characters are bland and not at all likable, and I can't help thinking that I don't mourn Willy Loman's passing at all. He and Linda were terrible parents who never taught their sons about integrity and proper gender relations, and as Biff and Happy are not terribly young (early thirties), they have no excuse for not having learned about these important characteristics on their own. The play overall is bland and boring and sometimes confusing, mixing flashbacks with reality."
3,"Am. Stud. Review of DoS - Lauren, Elyse, Lisa, Jess, & Emily","Our group thought that this book was well written; however, it was not a book that we felt we could relate to. The theme of the book was mainly the stuggle to obtain the American Dream. Arthur Miller developed the characters in this book well, as well as clearly outlining what life was like during this era. We felt that we could really see what was going on in each of the characters' minds, espicially Willy. This play told the story of a family through present day and the father's memories from the past. It took you on a two day journey of how a certain salesman was spun through the chaos of his own mind and how he became known as the tragic hero. This book was intesting, and taught us a lot about the competitive world during the turn of the century."
3,it is good.,it reflect the reality after World War 2 and Cold War.My favorite character is Linda. she really loves her husband and ready to sacrifice for him.
3,"Eh, not my favorite...","Being an English major, this book was not one of my favorite works, but I wouldn't skimp on reading it either. Arthur Miller is a brilliant playwright/author but for some reason it just didn't grasp me like other works have in the past and I've read hundreds of books. If you need something to read to occupy your time, this book is a good read but it's not the best."
4,American Dream?,"I read The Crucible before reading Death of a Salesman and I'll be honest, I preferred the former. But Miller's masterpiece is a vehicle for a representation of the negative portrayals of the superficial American Dream. Other books deal with the dilemma of fantasy against reality. (i.e. Streetcar Named Desire) Yet what makes this book different is the way it relates the conflict to an average American family struggling to make ends meet. For lack of a more sophisticated phrase, the play is so sad. When the characters lie to themselves and each other, I desperately hope that Miller is telling the truth and that these characters will be happy. I won't spoil the end, but the outcome forces you to question whether or not the American Dream is truly possible for everyone who simply works hard. It's a great read."
4,"Frank, Matt, Vijay, and Bryan's Comprehension","Death of a Salesman is the valiant effort of Arthur MIller to tell the story of a struggling and confused salesman. MIller's characters are realistic and the audeince can empathize with them. At times, the symbolism within the story could be confusing, but after some thought, everything can make some sort of sense. In the end the reader will care for the characters and their fate. The ending will cause a sort of momentary reflection within the reader. A cathartic reaction is produced; a feeling of relief. This story is worth reading to at least see how one's perception of the world can actually become harmful."
3,everybody's got to read this,"Although this wasn't one of my all-time favorites, Death of a Salesman is one of those books everyone has to read once. The tale of 60 year old Willy Loman, a furniture salesman for over 40 years is just getting too tired to keep going. Between traveling up and down New England and dealing with his son, Biff, who was supposed to be the gem of the family, Willy is not doing so well. But instead of feeling bad for him, he manages to do a whole lot of terrible things to make you just about hate him. So read it and find out how he ruins his own life and the lives of the people he loves. This is a book for all Americans, you just got to read it."
4,WOW!!!,"This is a powerfully sad play. It really demonstrates the deterioration of a man's dream. It almost made me cry, and I have never cried because of a book. It is an easy read, and I suggest YOU read it because it is very insightful."
2,what the?!?!?,"Let me start out by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Annie Lennox both with the Eurythmics and solo. So with much excitement, I ordered the Pavement Cracks remixes after hearing so much positive buzz. What a disappointment for me. Maybe I am just not a fan of remixes but the original album track is so superior to these. All remixes have the same jumpy beat with only the 4th version using alternative vocal samples and even that is monotonous. If you like this song do yourself a favour and get the album 'Bare' - that version is beautiful and haunting."
1,"What a waste, only 10 songs in one CD","I just don't know why the record companies kept pushing out CDs with only ten songs, especially in the U.S.A., only 20 odd minutes of music contained in this ""Curb"" CD makes it less attractive, Vol.1 & Vol.2 should be incorporated as 1 CD. Those who want to get hold of Paul Anka's ABC/Paramount originals in one CD should look for the CD ""THE GOLDENBOWL - Paul Anka's Original Greatest Hits"", Amazon.co.jp ASIN : B000065VNX, a soundtrack album of a Japanese TV drama using Paul's songs as background music issued on 2002.5.22. and is still available at Amazon.co.jp (search for Paul Anka, the CD cover is the one with a jukebox on the left and a sofa in orange and white strip on the right, this information is updated on 28 Mar 2007). Altogether 23 of Paul most popular hits including a 2002 version of ""You are my destiny"". You can also find Paul's oldies CDs from his official website."
5,Oh to be so carefree again!,"I was just a kid when most of these songs were popular, but I can still sing every line! Oh to be 8 years old and have no cares in the world again! Thanks for being a big part of my childhood Shaun!"
5,Great collection of songs by Shaun!!,This is a great CD!! I wish they would release his original albums on CD as well but until that happens this is the next best thing. There is also a version of Once Bitten Twice Shy that was later recorded by Great White on here. Hopefully they will at least release a part two and include more songs from Born Late and Under Wraps. Any Shaun Cassidy fan will highly enjoy this collection of hits.
3,Still silly over Shaun,"I love this cd. I was just listening to it again last night and as I was enjoying every song now, I was also enjoying the memory of each song back in the day. I only wish the songs Holiday ( from Shaun's self-titled album) , Audrey and Walk Away ( from Born To Late ), and Our Night ( from Under Wraps ) were here also. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a Shaun Cassidy Greatest Hits Vol. 2. P.S. Lets have a Rex Smith Greatest Hits Vol 1. while were at it. ;-)"
3,"WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS A 2-FOR-1 WITH SHAUN'S DEBUT AND ""BORN LATE""","... because most of the material past those two albums lack the magical combination of pop sensibilities and production smarts... and while his debut album was a powerful jab at bubblegum pop stardom, ""Born Late"" was the critical knockout punch - a terrific album from start to finish that deserves to be released on CD, with Shaun contributing some of its very best tracks with his own compositions (""Teen Dream"" and ""Strange Sensation"").PS: ""Born Late"" fans might want to check out Phil Seymour's self-titled debut now available on CD."
2,CD,"I like the CD, except the first track is blank and that is one of the best songs. I don't know if all the CD's are that way, but I was disappointed to be missing a song."
4,Shaun Cassidy greatest hits,I bought this CD main for the memories. It has turned out that I have enjoyed listening to it more than I thought. My five year old niece loves to listen to this CD everytime she comes to my house. She likes it so well I am thinking of buying her one so she can listen to it at her house.
5,YEAH!!!!!,"I adored Shaun Cassidy from the time I was five years old! The first concert I ever went to was Shaun's and I slept in my Shaun Cassidy night shirt until it fell apart! I had every album he ever made! I am so excited to see this on CD since I no longer have a record player!Unfortunately the sound quality is low but it still makes me deliriously happy to listen to it!No matter how much my boyfriend and my mom make fun of me for buying this, I am thrilled to have it!!!"
5,Attention: Shaun Cassidy Fans,"The cream of the crop for the singer-actor-teen idol who scored a few big hits in a short period, including the #1, ""Da Doo Ron Ron."" Eric Carmen fans will get a kick out of Cassidy's takes on ""Hey Deanie"" and ""That's Rock 'n' Roll."" Great sound, and since it's tough to find these songs anywhere else (""Da Doo Ron Ron"" is particularly elusive), get this CD while you can!"
2,"Neat design, but not good range.","This gun is a different design than many of the other Nerf blasters (both balls and darts). The design to cool, and it is an interesting gun to use. The range, which is likely the best of the ball nerf guns, is still pretty bad - I'm getting only about 15-20 feet before the ball just drops out of the air."
4,Contents Wonderful - Binding Substandard,"This may very well be the best prayer book in 50 years. The wealth of devotions provided, including a simplified scheme for daily prayer, will amply meet and even surpass the needs of anyone serious about developing an improved prayer life.However, the British edition, published by Canterbury and called A BOOK OF HOURS AND OTHER CATHOLIC DEVOTIONS, is printed on superior paper and in a sturdy vinyl binding with a ribbon marker. The Loyola edition, here listed, is clunky, is printed on poor quality paper in feint print and has cheap, cardboard covers.This is a truly wonderful prayer book, but please buy the British edition, not the American one. It will last for years and will become a true companion in prayer."
5,Excellent compilation of traditional Catholic prayers,"The Book of Catholic Prayer is one of my most used prayer books. I bought this book because it included the Psalter or Liturgy of Hours, which is the Prayer of the Church. It's not exactly like the Breviary that priests use or the official Liturgy of Hours, rather it is a modified version but unlike books like Christian Prayer which only have Morning and Evening Prayers, but this has the seven times of the day when we are called to pray. There are also sections for everyday prayers, devotions, prayers for different occasions, litanies and recommended reading. This book is not really one you would like to tote around (the size is the only disadvantage I see). It's usefulness compensates for its bulkiness."
5,One of the Best Contemporary Polka Artists!!,"Lynn Marie is simply one of the best polka artists of all time and brings a new and refreshing dimension to the modern polka. This CD is fabulous and worth the purchase alone for ""That's What I Like About the North"" song. Her other CDs are all fabulous as well."
1,poor,"was not happy with product, the problem is i purchase two of them, one to give as a gift. Will not be ordering these again"
3,These books rule!!!,"I have two series out of the American Girls and I absolutely love them. I have Samantha and Josefina. My favorite is Josefina. The reason I gave this book 3 stars is because Meet Felicity isn't very good, and that's what I'm reviewing.My sister likes Kirsten. All in all, AG is very good."
4,Sweet and Simple,"This collection of books about Felicity, a girl in colonial America, is a wonderful chronology of the life and times of people in America's earliest history. The stories are simple, but sweet and often touching."
5,A Collection for Generations,"I am a 22 year woman who fell in love with Felicity and the other American Girls when I was about 9 years old. The American Girls Collection is why I love history and am pursuing a career in the field. I've enjoyed passing my collection of books onto my younger sisters, each of whom equally fell in love with the stories and the time periods. I am expecting my first child shortly, a girl, and I can not wait until she is old enough to enjoy these stories as I and my siblings have. These books are a must for any young girl and they are sure to become favorites for your family for generations to come."
3,Sanding Stuff,"The squishy, shelf-liner like stuff on the back was pretty interesting. Helped prevent some hand fatigue but I wouldn't recommend this if you need to bend the sandpaper around things. The backing really prevented that. It was gritty and sanded stuff."
4,don mclean rocks,"this is a very talented artist,in my opinion the best songs are vincent,american pie,since i dont have you but dont get me grong all the songs are great.i say buy this cd"
4,retriever's recommendation,"our 3 retrievers are 9,8 and 3 years young and we're working hard to keep them healthy and not go bankrupt. We were using another joint supplement that works great but costing $$$$. We decided to use this food in the am and pinnacle's chicken and oatmeal for the pm meal. High quality food that won't kill my budget. The dogs love the taste, their coats are shiny, joints are moving well and yard clean up is minimal."
4,Helpful,"I ordered this for an injury I had gotten whilst exercising. It took close to a month to get and although I still have the injury I really needed it sooner, but now I have got it, the fit is good and seems to be helping."
3,not bad tho not great,only 40 min long. shows some fairly useful techniques about 6 total. in hindsight i think its worth 10/15 bucks honestly.
5,I love these sneakers!,"I don't usually by shoes online, I like to try them on first. But these are SO comfortable, and I got a great deal on them through Amazon. The second day I wore them, I probably walked 10 miles - without any discomfort at all.I ordered another couple of pairs for future use. :) (I walk a lot!)"
3,Works fine but no push on/push off,The manufacturer description shows push on/push off function along with rotary control. This unit does not have the push on/push off feature. That feature is reserved for the manufacturer's rotory dimer only models. I would love this unit to have the push on/off feature instead of having to turn the knobs all the time.
5,Great product at a low price,"I purchased four of these to replace more expensive switches from well-known brand ""H"". The other switches were sliders that were flimsy and I had three of the four break within two years of use. This rotary switch model feels much more robust and works great! Highly recommend if you're looking to install a light dimmer & fan control into a single-gang electrical box."
1,This sucks...,I ordered this item way back around early March and I have never received it. I tried to file a claim on Amazon but it didn't let me until pass April 8. Almost two weeks have passed by since I filed my claim and I still haven't heard any result form Amazon or the seller. This experience was really bad. I will recommend this seller or this website to any of my frieds.
4,Wayne gets personal,"I was not a Wayne Newton fan by any means until I heard the single track ""I know so"" from this cd on the Roseanne series(1988-1997) where Dan and Rosie go to Las Vegas to see their idol, Wayne Newton. The song is as catchy as an early Paul McCartney tune but with the country flavor that only Wayne can add. On ""Moods & Moments"", you'll find some songs from the heart such as ""Little bits and pieces"" and ""The Letter"". I always thought that Wayne was just Las Vegas material until I listened and came to see that this man has alot to offer. This cd is packed with some mellow songs that Wayne sings with all his might (""At this moment"") and belts out some tunes with serious gusto. Who would of known? I didn't. Now I am a Wayne Newton fan."
1,Gaia Herbs-lemon balm 1 oz. from Nature's Apothecary,"This is the first time I ordered this item sold on Amazon by Nature's Apothecary. I ordered 3, but received only one - last of the stock. I have used this product, purchased from other merchants, since a long time . But this one tasted so bad that I stopped after using it once. The expiry date (1/16) was OK. It is possible that just this one bottle was bad. In any case it left a bad taste in my mouth.I do not recommend this product from this merchant."
1,Too Much,Was very excited about the 40-30-30 diet until I read this cookbook. I couldn't possibly eat as much as they are asking one to eat at these perfectly balanced 40/30/30 meals. 10 cups of lettuce & vegees at a sitting! No way. 2-3 hours prep time in the kitchen for a meal? Not me!
1,Recipes take too long to make!,"If you have someone at home to cook for you, this might be a fine book. However, I work full time and am looking for quick, healthy recipes. I started cooking breakfast this morning at 7:00 and by the time I had eaten, cleaned up the pile of pots and pans, run all of the peppers through the food processor for the next 8 meals I had bought food for, it was 9:30! No way to spend a sunny Saturday. Now it's time to start lunch!"
2,Meals are only for 1 serving,"If you are trying to cook for a family this is NOT the book for you. All the recipies are for one serving. When you start to doubling and tripling the recipe you end up with 10-15 cups of vegetables for one meal. Not a good book if you also want to cook for the kids, they won't like the meals. And certainly not 'meals in minutes'. Some of the meals taste good and are perfect if you are only cooking for one."
3,May be helpful,"This book is a good book but is really only useful if you have mastered the information in ""Enter the Zone"" by Dr. Sears."
3,Great,I honestly haven't even cracked this one open. I've looked through the pages to see if anything sounded appealing. Several things do I just haven't had the time to sit down and really go through this one.
4,This book is fabulous.,"This amazing cookbook has helped me lose eight hundred pounds. It's taught me how to use bread for sandwiches rather than two twinkies, how to make my famous ""artery clogger chilli"" without five sticks of butter. It's changed my life so much i don't know how to thank you guys at amazon[.com] for bringing it to my door."
2,Recipes offer no variety or creativity.,"I'm a firm believer in the Zone way of eating but the recipes in this book are truly ridiculous. The book starts out with a good and basic explanation of the Zone principles however that's where its practicality ends. The recipes are all built on the same principle--veggies for carbs, lean meat or poultry for the protein, then throw in some nuts or oil for the fat. The only variety are the types of veggies and maybe the method of cooking. The ""dessert"" recipes, for example, are just different kinds of fruit on cottage cheese. Same with the breakfast recipes--I really don't need twenty different recipes for omlets spelled out for me. Simply reading the Zone explanation would give anyone enough knowledge to put together the kind of meals that are presented in this book. This book would only be valuable as a bare-bones introduction into the Zone and even for that purpose ""40-30-30 Fat Burning Nutrition"" by Gene & Joyce Daoust would be a much better choice."
4,Good variety of recipes,"I am no longer following the Zone diet, but when I was on it, I found this book to be very helpful.There are enough recipes in this book that I could always find something that worked for me. I tended towards the simpler ""snack"" recipes, partly because some of the other ones did take more time to prepare.I've also got a large family (at the time I had 4 children) so the recipes had to be increased a good bit for my family. Which wasn't a huge problem, but some of the meals were just too expensive to make for so many.There are some great egg recipes in there, and very easy to fix snacks, and it's all thought out and balanced, which, of course, is a definite plus for staying in the Zone.The recipes were very easy to follow and understand, even for a novice cook such as myself. I would recommend this book for anyone following this diet, and even for those who aren't, simply because it IS a sensible way to eat, and the recipes are easy and varied."
1,"150 Ways to Ruin Food with Vinegar, Salsa, and Worcester","I faithfully made almost every dinner entree in this book, and most were not only bad, but inedible. The salmon with salsa on top of snow peas was an abomination.I gave it one star for the one recipe that was good (taco salad). I recommend creating your own Zone recipes."
4,Great book for changing your lifestyle and lose weight!!,"Although I liked the recipies the best, I especially liked the masterful way in which Barry lays out a game plan on eating habits and organizing daily meals. I was a nimrod when I began his program, but now have lost weight and gained confidence in my daily life through diet."
3,One size fits ... if you have small hands,"The size of these gloves are what I would describe as mens small-medium. If your hands are larger than that, pass on these. The quality is ok, about the same as I get at the dollar store."
2,Bad coils or bad luck. You choose.,I've just had my second Accel coil die after about 6 months. I ended up installed an HEI in my chevy and had no more issues. It would run fine when cold but then when warm it missed some and had a hard time starting.
2,Accel 8140C Superstock Chrome Ignition Coil,"Do not buy this piece of junk! I bought one and it worked great for a couple months then I noticed that the car seemed to be loosing some of its get up and go and I tried a couple things to no avail because usually when a coil goes they get hot and shut down, but not this one the vehicle just seemed to not have as much power especially when towing. So I though about it for a while and did some research on these coils and did not like what I found a lot of negative reviews compared to positive ones, so just on a chance I bought a new Borg Warner Select Series Coil an what do you know the car is its old self again. Then I noticed if you shook the Accel Coil a bit I could hear sloshing oil inside (not good), then I took the original stock coil which I still have and shook it and did not hear any oil sloshing around. So this is yet another bad review for the Accel Super Stock Ignition Coil!"
2,"Pretty chrome, but defective.","I purchased this coil to use with my Duraspark ignition on an old Ford. It has the same primary resistance as the original coil and it seemed to work well with the factory resistor wire. It took me 2 years to find that the coil was defective. The problem I had really seemed to be a vapor lock issue. If I were idling in traffic on a hot day, sometimes the engine would die and I couldn't get it restarted. Other times, it wouldn't restart after shutting off the engine on a hot day. Either way, if I let it cool for a while, it would restart just fine. Finally, after using an ignition spark tester, I saw that the coil was heating up and loosing spark. I ultimately bought a cheap Duraspark replacement coil and haven't had any issues since."
4,A Great Cure for Bad Reactions to Good Eyeglasses!,"Baby Duck is unhappy about the new glasses she has to wear because she thinks she can no longer hop, dance, or play or they will fall off. She also thinks she looks ugly in them. But, her bespeckled grandfather saves the day by reaassuring her about her glasses. He says they ""are very fine . . .[b]ecause they are red like mine."" He convinces her that they won't fall off when she plays by having her splash in water and twirl around. Finally, he gives her a surprise - a new little boat with her name on it - which she can now read with her new glasses. Heartwarming, beautifully illustrations and large text make up for the somewhat skimpy story. Recommended for ages 2 to 8 and highly recommended for those with eyeglasses or young friends or family members who just got eyeglasses."
4,good jam music,"Heavy and not to be taken too seriously. Definetly LA stoner music. If you want bludgeoning sledgehammer head injury music see: Electric Wizard, Sleep, Khanate, Bongzilla, Grief to name just a few. This band is another great Sabbath prototype with a flair for the 70's. Throw in some Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, and tons of sabbath with accesible vocals and you have Fu Manchu. Kyuss contempories, but not quite as good, this is still great to jam to. Hell on Wheels is awesome. BUY THIS."
3,Too stoned...,"Look this is listenable but I find it a bit to monotonous. The music is very laughable for what reason I can't pin down. Would not expect you to enjoy this CD if your a fan of Kyuss or Orange Goblin. Has a more garage rock sound. Personally I suggest you skip Fu Manchu. Now if you can find Cuda (two of the members from Bongzilla, a real stoner rock band) then you will see what Fu Manchu only wishes they could be."
2,been done,"there really is no reason to listen to this or any other fu manchu album. they are the sugar ray of stoner rock. If you can listen to this then listen to a kyuss album and say fu is better and then take a lie detector test, I will glady give you a mil."
2,One for obsessive fans,I was disappointed by this poorly made documentary. It consists mainly of talking heads that tend to repeat themselves. There is very little footage of Leonard Cohen and the obvious filler bits are irritating. 'I'm Your Man' and 'Ladies and Gentleman' are more worthwhile purchases.
2,NOT CHRISTIAN FICTION,It was in Christian Fiction list and this series definitely is not. I always order from the Christian Fiction list.
5,Lewis Black Unleashed,Lewis Black is the funniest guy around--and he doesn't tell jokes but refers to today's goings on.The DVD was fine and arrived on time.
3,"Not his best, but still good","It's his older stuff, some of it is still funny and relevant and some of it moves too slowly."
4,"Lewis Black - Unleashed, but censored","I am a big fan of Lewis Black and try to catch his specials regardless of time or channel. This is a collection of 3 specials that aired on Comedy Central, two 30 minutes specials and a one hour special. While this is some of Lewis's best know work, it only touches on the greatness of his comedy style. Being that these specials were recorded for basic cable programing, they are un-censored, but the tone of them is pulled back some. This belongs in the DVD collection of any Lewis Black fan, but don't expect the full force or Lewis."
2,Disappointing,"I liked Lewis Black very much when he was on the Daily Show, with his sharp comments about current news items. The humor on this DVD lacks the sharpness and the bite. He seems to always start with weak jokes about the weather, on his DVDs. Sorry I bought this one."
4,CC Specials minus the commercials! :-),"This is pretty much essential Lewis material from the late 90s and early 00s: Weathermen, Candy Corn, IHOP, Starbucks, MTV at the SuperBowl, and Bill Clinton's ""winky."" Granted, the specials are 20-22 minutes a piece, but Lewis adds a line or a nuance or two that's not on the HBO specials or his albums. Taxed Beyond Belief is a bit of a bore, much like any taped segment on The Daily Show these days. We get it: taxes suck. (And you can spot the teleprompter hidden in the classroom) Plus, the finger pointing is contagious, lol. These days, he's calmed down a bit, but still gets angry at what bugs him most: politicians and Snooki. If you get the chance to see him live, do it. You won't regret it."
2,He's has done allot better,"Personally I didn't enjoy this one as much as did as ""Black on Broadway"" or ""Red White and Screwed"" both of which were ""halarious"". Not the fact that they are just funny but true to life and quite accurate. He seems to be much funnier at Stand - up comedy then to situation comedy."
1,Can't get CD to install properly after many attempts,"I'm going to keep trying to get this cd to install, its not working for me. I have Windows XP and its giving me problems and annoying the heck out of me. Not sure what to do, Bought this for my oldest who needs a little more help in math. Hopefully I can get this to work and give a better review after seeing her progress."
4,Makes me look younger,I started to gray prematurely and after doing away with my buzz cut I looked 20 years older. Girlfriend uses this on my hair and now I look my age! Hair color looks natural...not dyed! She likes the look and so do my friends. May stain headline skin after the first application but shampooing the next day takes care of that. A couple of friends have tried it and they like it very much. Hard to apply by self. Don't forget to wear the gloves.Overall a great product and much cheaper than going to a men's salon.
5,You'll love this book!,"This guide provides an excellent, comprehensive, step by step review of being a dog owner. It covers deciding if a dog is the right pet for you, deciding which kind of dog fits your lifestyle, preparing your home, buying food and supplies, introducing the dog to the family and other pets, nutrition, health, training, behavior, older pets, legal pet ownership issues, and many other topics. Although the breed descriptions are somewhat brief for a detail fanatic like myself, the pictures are nice, and it's a good starting point for researching specific breeds more in depth. The breed descriptions strive to remain positive, while indicating that there may be some less than desirable and/or difficult to manage tendencies in some breeds. I look at this book all the time even though I already have 2 dogs."
3,"This book is somewhat innaccurate, yet it does include important facts as well.","Some of the facts in this pet care guide are innaccurate, as well as MOST of them being true. Although some of the life span facts, and ibs. facts are incorrect. This dog guide is worth buying, as long as you don't rely on it as your number one recource. Use the internet, and other books as well, to backup some of your un-answered questions, and facts you're un-sure of in this dog care guide. This book is great for looking up quick facts, but not great for searching up a full backround, or history check on a specific breed,and/or illness."
2,Important information incorrect,"This book has a problem with accuracy and because of its popularity, the misinformation keeps getting spread. For example, the Bernese Mountain Dog is listed as a weight of 80-90 lbs and a life-span of 10-12 years.Typically, the female BMD weighs 70-90 lbs and the boys 80-120 lbs. -- I've seen one at 162 lbs as well and another close to 30"" at the withers. The average life span is sadly 6-7 years, but a lot of that is bi-modal -- a lot of dogs are lost at 4 to cancers, as well as a peak at 7 and most of the rest around 10. Every year, the Alpenhorn celebrates all dogs who have reached the age of 10 by publishing their picture. That's not something you do if the average lifespan is 10-12.If you are looking at dog breeds, don't use this as your solo or principal guide."
2,Not What We Thought,"We purchased just one volume of this Explore Your Body set to sample it for our home school. Although the story line seemed very interesting, it was completed in a few days, and is now useless to us. If all of the volumes were sold together at a MUCH lower price, it might be worth it."
4,I Love the Bugs!!,"I am 32 years young and I play this way more than my 5 year old daughter. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because Ithink they could have put in at least one more excellent game like ""SPLAT"" the bug game that I just cannot stop playing. What a challenge!!!! It is driving me crazy. Don't get me wrong the other games are good, just not as good as splat. Anyway, bottomline, if you loved the movie as much as we did, then this is a must have. P.S.-download the full version not the shortcutthat they recommend for most computers, it will be well worth the space!!!!"
2,very dissapointed,"the graphics and sound are very bad ,this game stinks,graphics like when computers first came out,i dont know what they were thinking!"
4,"A good book, replaced by a newer edition.","This has been replaced by an updated edition. Search for 1864503599, or look under ""Our Customers' Advice"" above. It is still a great guide for your journey of Discovering Russia.We always tell clients and other visitors to Russia that you should get the most current guidebook, as attractions, hotels, restaurants and transportation options do often change--AND THEN VERIFY THE INFORMATION!Marc David Miller, Discovering Russia, New York"
2,not accurate,"Just came back from Moscow. I usually love LP Guides and have only been using LP guides when I travel, so it was a surprise that the Moscow guide turned out to be be so lacking in terms of usefulness. The problem mainly lies in opening times of sights and details about admissions. It was quite obvious that the guide needs an update."
2,limited,"I came to Moscow on business and my work took me to parts of Moscow that are not necessarily tourist attractions like science institutes. But I thought that having a book about Moscow would help. This was just not the book for me. Moscow is a behemoth city so it would be difficult to cover everything. But, things like the maps not covering the entire city and the map of the subway only covering the main section was really irritating. The metro map is very different than the official maps. it would be useful to have the official map in there. The instructions on getting Sergiev Posad were not great either. The hotel listings are pretty limited. I know..it's a lot to ask. If you are going to Moscow beyond the typical tourist places, don't buy this book."
3,"good reading, facts not 100%","The Lonely Planet Moscow guide was extremely enjoyable to read and provided excellent maps, though a magnifying glass was necessary to read the details. My only qualm with the book was that despite having a recent publication date of March 2003, some of the details were out-of-date. Specifically, the Metropol Hotel was listed as part of the Intercontinental chain with an intercontinental e-mail but when I called Intercontinental I was informed that they sold ownership of the hotel several years ago (current e-mail is metropol@metmos.ru). Thus, I recommend the book as good reading but for detailed planning caution is necessary.PS: This problem was not unique to this volume. We experienced a similar problem with other books in the series."
3,Rava's great but the Michael Flugel Quartet is not,"Think of the Dolphy dates in Europe with the Benny Bailey group in Berlin or the Misha Mengleberg group in Scandanavia. Rava is great (His solo on My Funny Valentine is worth the price of the recording) but when he's not playing, the magic ain't happening.Of interest to diehard Rava fans only."
3,Fats is Hurt by Quality of Sound,"The quality of sound I heard was not up to standards for a singer with the stature of Fat's Dominoe. Many of the songs on this cd are old standards and always a joy to listen to. Of the songs sampled, ""Fat Man"" was a new treat for me. ""My Girl Josephine"" has a sound and rhythm that takes you back to songs like ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"". If the sound quality is better than what I heard, this would be a welcome addition for Fats' fans."
2,PA use only!,"This product should only be used for commercial applications. The spectrum of sound that these speakers emit is severely lacking in certain frequencies so much so that low level listening is generally not applicable. They do have bass response, but there are a lot more frequencies important to sound reproduction than just that. Because of these missing frequencies, the efficiency of these speakers are very low, maybe 80 db (90 db is average); so, you need a use a powerful amp and again low level listening just does not work."
2,Buyer Beware: VisionTek and Amazon.com,"OK so the product is not bad, but when you purchase it under the pretense of receiving a $25.00 rebate, then have to fight both VisionTek and Amazon.com it makes it a negative experience. I bought this when I was in Iraq serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom and had it shipped by a relative to me. When I got home I wanted the rebate...and the trouble began. The still-not-gotten rebate is NOT worth the trouble. I would have purchased another larger capacity item if not for the low price after rebate."
3,"The USB drive is good, problem is $25 rebate","I brought this USB drive (my first one) in August mainly because it is inexpensive after rebate. The drive itself is pretty good, but the my problem is the $25 rebate. First, I never found my rebate info on wheresmyrebate.com. Second, I called wwwsmyrebate.com (1800-390-2344) in late Oct and was told that my rebate was going to be maild on Nov 19, 2003. You know what happened. I called again today and waited for 15 min. I was told this time that the rebate will be mailed on Dec 17, 2003. Looks like it will be my Xmas gift! The lady on the other side told me that manufacturer delayed rebate processing.I will buy a bigger one (at least 256 MB) later on, but definitely not from VisionTek."
2,Not reliable,"Don't buy any flash drive from this VisionTek. It failed within a year. I lost some critical data. The sad part is that I need to submit a $10 money order along with the defective drive in order to get a replacement. That means I need to take out $15 to get a replacement for VisionTek 64mb flash drive. I can buy a BRAND NEW one for that price. VisionTek is such a small company, they cannot even afford the return postage. Shame for them."
5,Excellent lullaby,This book is a very dear non monetary rendition of a familiar song. I highly recommend the story to any new parents.
5,It's the best one for children,This set of the flannel rabbit and the book is the favourite of my neice. She always plays with the rabbit and we don't need to worry b'coz it is very safe. The book has some great illustrations. My neice wants to hear the stories everyday at the bedtime.
2,hush little babay,The book arrived with white spots on cover and I wanted it for a gift so I did not return. The book itself has lovely pictures and a wonderful story.
3,It is ok,I like it ok beacuse I think the story could have being more entertaining. The drawings are ok as well
4,"Nice Idea, but not my favorite","We borrowed 3 books about this song from the library to compare. This is a revised version of the classic song. It's a nice idea... to change the lyrics so that it isn't about a completely spoiled child. However, the new lyrics didn't do a lot for me. The only reason I would buy it is because of the nostalgia of the song... and if I'm buying for that reason, I might as well buy one with the classic version instead. So this wasn't my top pick. But it is a nice book -- I'm just being critical, because I was trying to choose between 3 options. :)"
5,Highly Recommended,"We received this book as a gift, and at almost 3, my daughter and I sing this every night after all her other stories have been read. She knows the words by heart, and it is such a wonderful rendition of that familiar tune, with words that celebrate the joys of going to bed - from crickets calling to moons drifting through the skies, to warm bedspreads and soft lullabies. I bought 4 to have on hand as baby gifts. Beautiful illustrations too."
5,Hush Little Baby,This book is adorable. I love the focus of this book as it conveys to the child to find comfort in beautiful things in nature(like the evening sky) instead of materialistic things.
5,WONDERFUL GIFT FOR NEW BABY,This is my all time favorite gift to give to a new mom and her baby. It is loved by all that I give it to. It is a must read for new moms and their babies.
4,Wonderful alternative to a classic lullabye,"Like many reviewers noted, I always took issue with the famous verses of Hush Little Baby, being that they were all about what the parent could buy the child. I truly enjoy this version and find it sweet and simple. I'm not a tremendous fan of the illustrations, however. That's the only reason I did not give this book 5 stars."
5,Perfect for the smallest of children to the biggest,Hush Little Baby is a terrific book for the smallest of children (1 year old) to older children. I give it to all of my friend's children for their 1st birthdays and the moms love it. We read it over and over again!
1,Won't last!!!!!,"I bought 2 identical units in November of '07 from Home Depot. 2 months later, they stopped selling tv's there. Now I know why ! 3 weeks after I bought them, one of them went black. Took it back to Home Depot and they gave me another one but I had to trade up to a 50"" cause they were out of 42"". I took out 4 year ext. warrenties on both at $299 ea. ""GOOD DECISION""Now 2 years later, the 2nd 42"" has went black, with a colored bar along one edge and a few pixels dancing across the screen ? Magnavox has been no help at all to the repair people sent to the house. From all the people that have had this problem, Magnavox knows exactly what the problem is but doesn't want to admit to it for fear they will have massive claims pouring in. Cause for sure, the poor souls who didn't get any extended warrenties are just most likely going to scrap thiers out rather than pay 5 - 600 $ to repair it !!!!! I'll steer away from all Magnavox in the future."
1,"Problems, problems, problems",We purchased a plasma from Magnavox in Nov. of 05...an earlier version of this model. Within the first 3 months we started having problems with the picture getting lines through it. We spent hours...many hours on the phone with Magnavox trying to locate someone to service this TV. A company finally did. Three months later more problems occurred...the enamel began to peel and flake...the picture got worse...so we then had to send our TV to another service center for over 3 months. We got it back Feb. of 2007. It does not work at all now...no picture...nothing and Magnavox will not even consider fixing or replacing it because it is out of the puny one year warranty. DONT BUY A MAGNAVOX PRODUCT!
1,Do not waste your money,"I purchased this TV 2 years ago. The image started failing, basically starts shaken then the screen goes black.(still you can heard the audio). We have to turned off and on waiting at least 30 minutes on unpluggin from the power. NOT RECALLS for this item eventhough is cost around $2,000"
1,Now junkyard crap,"We had this set for 3.5 years. Used in in my hubby's man cave. One day suddenly picture was gone, but we had sound. After doing a little research found out, our set lasted longer than most, two years is average. Some even smoke......Magnavox should do a recall...........soon! stop selling crap!"
2,It always breaks right after the warranty expires!,"I received this 42"" Plasma HDTV for Christmas year before last...and was so excited! It was everything that I wanted in a television and worked perfectly!.........for the first year and a half! One day, we went to turn it on and after about 10 minutes of working, the screen went black...and stayed black. The sound works great but their is no picture at all. I called Magnavox for some help, but seeing as it is out of its 1 year warranty, they were no help except to tell me to unplug and wait a few minutes. After that didnt work, I was told I could have a technician come to the house (for a fee they could not predict!) I have since called a local repair shop and they have told me that they could not help me because it is a Magnavox. I was told to drive it to a Magnavox dealer and hope for help from them. (but its gonna be pricey he said) So, I guess I've got a really expensive XM Radio or a very unique table with no legs!"
1,Magnavox 42MF231D 42-Inch Plasma HDTV IS JUNK,"My wife and I bought this TV two years ago (2008). It started to turn itself off occasionally in 2009, but the video and sound worked fine so we didn't sweat it. Then it began turning it self off more and more in 2010. Also the stereo signal would sometimes shift to mono and then come back to stereo. The latest is that the screen will go half black, either the top or the bottom, at random. We turn it off and on and sometimes that fixes it for 30 minutes or more, sometimes not. Now it's gone to full black screen, with audio. It cost around $2000 and I'm planning on taking it down from the wall in our bedroom and throwing it through the bedroom window and onto the front lawn tomorrow, and then getting another make/model. we got an LG for the living room and it's awesome and way cheaper. Do not buy this TV. Junk!!"
1,Used to love this series,"I used to love this series. Now there is no plot, and the characters are boring."
4,Author Of Vampyr's review,I loved this book so much so it went into detail with the sex it was nice to see all the lycanthropes again and meet new characters. The whole unexpected turn of Cassandra being a traitor unexpected for me anyway not a minute of boredom when reading for me each page as good as the first I just could not put it down!
2,what happened?,"I loved this series until I read this book. Anita is so self-centered, egotistical and unemotional in this book. I cannot stand her."
2,It is a big disappointment.,"If it had been any other book, and not from ""Anita Blake--Vampire Hunter"" series, I would have called it very interesting. As it is, it looses in comparison. First of all, there is no ""horrible murder"" investigation. There is a horrible murder, but no investigation. This book is simply a continuation of previous stories, and it is quite impossible to read it on its own, without knowing what happened previously. You loose too much of a context. I am also very unhappy with the transformation that happens to vampires throughout the course of this novel. Vampires are monsters, hungry for blood and power. If they are not, they are not that interesting. That is what vampires were in the series. Well, not any more! And what is happening to Anita herself? She is not only getting more boring, but also more stupid, or so it seems. I have waited for this book since last September. It was not worth the wait"
5,I say RICHARD all the WAY!,I began reading this book first instead of Guilty Pleasures. I loved it so much I went out and got the rest of the novels to see how it all began. I say Anita should be with Richard because he's just oh so romantic. He's Just what Anita needs. Don't get me wrong Jean-Claude sounds cute but...
1,"Lies, damned lies, and lost sales. Don't waste your time with this series.","I suppose I'll make this short and not-so sweet. I read the book hoping for a solution with Anita and Richard, it looked promising, and then she ends up screwing the dead guy. I literally threw the book across the room with disgust. I'm just glad I wasn't using my ebook reader at the time or I'm sure I would have broken it. To hell with the rest of the series, I'm just glad I hadn't bought the later books yet.Hamilton claimed in an interview that she listens to her characters and lets them decide what will happen. Well, she lies. The Anita in the first 5 books, and most of the 6th, wouldn't have had sex with that arrogant, obnoxious, worthless corpse. It was completely out of character.I wash my hands of this mess, too many books by better authors are out there to enjoy."
2,Was this edition proofread???!!!,"I have read all previous Anita Blake novels on my kindle without noticing any errors. However, this novel is fraught with misspellings. Considering one can buy the hardcopy for a penny, you would think that the eight dollar kindle edition would be corrected by now."
2,*Shudder* What happened?!,"Laurell K. Hamilton has ruined a perfectly good character as far as I'm concerned, Anita Blake was awesome, snappy punch lunchs, a true heroine to be admired! But now? First off, what happened to ""not sleeping with the monsters."" She broke that rule! Richard is a whiny baby, Jean-Claude just plain sucks, I find nothing sexy about the loser! N E way, Anita is now having sex with ""one of the monsters"", she's lost her snappy punch lines, her stories are getting monotonous, and she's turned into a psychpath! I liked it better when she was just a necromancer, aren't they rare enough as it is without her being the absolute best! I still have yet to read Burnt Offerings but if it and Blue Moon suck I'm done with Anita Blake 'cuz it'll all be mindless dribble if this keeps up!"
5,I have praise for this book as an avid reader.,I am extremely pleased with the direction this series has taken. Anita finally ditched that goody-two-shoes Richard forJean Claude. I feel that is time for Richard to grow-up. Anita could not have made a better chose than breaking her ''no sex with the monsters'' rule.
5,Just keeps getting better,"Anita is being hunted this time, and she learns that wehn Edward, her bounty-hunter friend, turns up to say he was offered the contract. Who's hunting her becomes second to her continuing relationships with both Richard and Jean-Claude. She finally comes to terms with her life and who she really is. Richard deals with internal pack relations, that Anita is, of course, involved in. All the while Jean-Claude is right there. I love him."
3,Pretty good but going downhill,Not as good as the first ones. This one has alot of arguing over whose going to be the greatest and such. OK but not her best.
1,Hamilton has lost her edge,"I recently started on this series and was hooked after book 2. Now, with Killing Dance, Hamilton has introduced so much lust with herione Anita Blake and Richard, the werewolf, and Jean-Claude, the vampire, that it simply takes away from any plot.I'm sorry, but a menage a trois between then was simply too much for me - even if it didn't go all the way. The series was good when the sexual tension was the backdrop to intriguing mysteries. Now, it's the focal point, with plot and substance running a far cry behind.I doubt I return to this series. I went ahead and read the reviews for the next six books in the series and I'm not impressed. Sorry, Hamilton, you've lost me on this one."
4,Vampire/Werwolf Porn...WOW,"I have been a fan of Laurel Hamilton's books since her very chaste beginnings (she had two boyfriends, but wouldn't sleep with either of them until she chose between them.) Now, the sex in her books is so explicit and kinky that a few years ago you could have bought them only in an adult book store. But the sex is not the main reason these books are so good. Her plot twists and turns are highly intricate and her characters, both human and non-human, are well drawn. A very petty criticism, however...I wish someone would Super Glue her hyphen key! She uses so many hyphenated phrases that it becomes annoying. But when you get into the hardcore action (whether sexual, investigative or battling) the books are pure fun."
5,anita blake rules!!!!!!!,"This is the ""best"" series ever! I read ""circus of the damned""first, then spent weeks scouring the book stores looking for the first two in the series! I am on pins & needles now waiting for my next Hamilton fix!! Hamilton can't churn them out fast enough for me. Jean claude is dreamy, and so is Richard. I can see what a hard choice Anita has. It makes me wish this soceity were real. I can identify with all the characters, and I love how tough Anita Blake is! This is a must read!! If you don't love these books, you are not all there!!!!!!!!"
4,am i the only one?,"is it just me, or is anita blake the most irritating character in this series? i am a big fan of these books, but i have to say,i like every other character, (even the villians) better then her. why does she have to be such a ""tough guy""? why does she have to be the toughest person in a room full of monsters? let's be serious, (in a fantasy kind of way) she has nothing on a master vamp, or an alpha wolf, but time and time again she's either rescuing them or kicking there respective butts...(that is, of course, when she's not too busy trying to decide if she likes the ""monster"" enough to save it, or hate the ""human"" enough to kill him) ...and as far as the whole jean-claude/richard saga,...i wish they both would have told her to kiss off. she deserves to be alone with her cherished browning. (maybe laurell will start a new series sans anita)."
4,A good addition to the series...,"I enjoyed reading this addition to the series. The focus was more on relationships (primarily that of the Richard/Anita/Jean-Claude triangle) rather than on the plot/action. I don't want to post any spoilers, and others have posted enough details about the plot anyway, so I'll just add that it was a fast read, with great tension between the main characters, and (finally) a resolution with the triangle - or at least a tentative resolution. Looking forward to reading the next in the series."
5,Excellent read,Hamilton keeps you riveted toevery page. I couldn't put it down and was sad when I was done but I immediately picked up the next in the series.
4,Surprising...,This series is the best! It is only getting better and better. I don't want to give to much away but the end of this book brings something I dind't expect. I am starting to like Jean-Claude's character a lot more as I read farther into the series..
5,Coolest series ever!!!!,"I've read all six books and loved um. I read them all in two weeks, I just couldn't put them down. At first I wanted Anita and Jean-Claude together, but by the end of the sixth book I really wanted Anita and Richard to be together. Have Jean-Claude play the ""better monster"" as he once put it. I can't wait to see what the next books will be like. Sometime Mrs. Hamilton will have to tell us Dolph's big secret. There also is the triumvirate, something really exciting is going to have to happen with that. Anita also owes Edward for Harvey, I wonder what kind of things they will get into next. I guess we'll find out around May. I know I can't wait. Can you"
3,Killing dance,I don't exactly share the same enthusiasm that everyone has for this book. I think this book has sacrificed the character of Anita. She's becoming unlivable. She dates both Richard and JC. Stringing them both along because she can't make a decision. Then after realizing she can't deal with Richard changing she sleeps with JC( a vampire who gasp drinks blood)It was a let down.Im not sure if I can get through the next book.
5,Still going strong..,"""The Killing Dance"" felt a little slower when it came to action, but it made up for it with some thrilling new developments in Anita's personal life...developments that I have been impatiently waiting and waiting for..I was not disappointed!! Another definite must read from Laurell Hamilton...God I love Jean-Claude..... :o)"
3,Laura's weakest Link in the Anita Series,"Every chain must have a weak link and this book was it. I love Horror books and was very pleased when I stumbled across the Anita Blake series, and I loved every book up 'till this one. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad book- it just was boring and I felt focused too much on the relations Anita is developing. I also felt that LKH took a step back from her characters, they don't feel as real as they did in the earlier installments of this series. Luckily, I just finish reading Obsidian Butterfly and can happily say LKH has got back into the writitng styles that she missed with this book."
4,"Vampires, and werewolves, and executioners - oh my...","I do love Ms. Anita Blake. Funny, Sassy, take no prisoners kind of woman. Yet, there is a part of her that is a monster too, and in part six of this series, she finally realizes this, and comes to a somewhat stunning but somewhat anticipated conclusion._The Killing Dance_ is just what you expect from Ms. Hamilton, fun, a quick and easy read, full of hunger and sex, blood, vampires and bad guys. Tho, I wonder where her side-kick from Bloody Bones went in this novel. He's myseriously absent.Two thumbs up, especially if you are a fan of the series, the ending is the worth the price of admission."
4,HATE IT OR LOVE IT,"As a devoted reader of the Anita Blake series, I wasa bit hurt at her choice of bed partners. I wasreally rooting for the other guy, and I'm ready toget this over with. Enough love triangles, get onto the story! As always, Anita's spending mostof the books killing people and filling the placewith the best gore! I love the characters, especiallyEdward. And I LOVED Harley!!! Too bad he's dead.Just when you think Mrs. Hamilton can't comeup with anymore good characters...still, this bookwas a bit boring. Anita's losing her edge. Whatattracted me to this series was that Anita wascold-hearted, and wasn't afraid to kick butt. Nowshe's so confused about what's what, am I oneof the monsters, blah blah blah. Oh, of course, I'llread the next, but it still won't be the same (Food forthought: I know Anita'll never have time for thiswith this love triangle, but ain't it a great thought?Edward and Anita! Imagine trying to mug themon a date!!!"
4,Great story still but dont need the detailed sex...,If I had wanted porn I would have got Hustler...Otherwise...good story and another strong link in the series.
5,Ma Petite Is Wonderful,"One of the reasons why I enjoyed this one so much is because Hamilton involves a lot more of her characters, especially Edward, whom we all love dearly. I do have a bone to pick with some of the people who argue that Anita is coming too far out of her human self. The woman never was human! That's why people call her a necromancer! Sure her attitude may have attracted Jean-Claude, but her power is what he and Richard really wanted once they realized the potential.I do wonder when Laurell Hamilton is really going to bring Larry into the story. And I hope that I am not the only one who's glad that Raina and Marcus are finally gone. The whole scene at the lupanar was a turning point for not only Richard, but Anita as well. The time finally came for Richard to accept his beast and Anita got to witness it first-hand (speaking politely). All in all though, I loved this book. It was packed full of action and something finally happened with the whole love triangle thing."
2,Inconsistent!!!,"The series was excellent up to this book. I feel that Anita got sold out at the end of this book. With all that was given to us about Anita, her character would NEVER have taken to Jean Claude's bed, NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!!. And her getting all sqwimish over Richard's changing and eating Marcus, doesn't seem like the same character that was able to pick apart half eaten bodies and raise zombies. The writing was excellent, but the plot lost something in this book. I'm certainly hoping Ms. Hamilton comes to her senses and gives our heroin the ""spunk, fire and passion"" back that she had in the previous books and HOPEFULLY Anita will come to her senses and realizes she made a HUGE mistake going for Jean Claude"
4,"Well, its about time!!","A rolicking romp (or should I say smoothly-gliding sojourn - seems to fit more with the general theme of the books). Many issues finally coming to a head (no pun intended - much!), and fast-paced actions with many (perhaps too many) snappy one-liners and petite-sized, but by no means diminished in effect, firepower.A well wrought effort. Thoroughly enjoyable; and she just keeps building her just slightly canted world history in leaps and bounds.Good stuff!!Bex"
3,"Decent collection...but not ""Ultimate""","This includes some really good Clint Black songs,but unfortunatly,it's missing too many.""Burn One Down"",""Put Yourself In My Shoes"",""No Time To Kill"" are just a few of the songs that should have been on here.What the heck is ""Dixie Lullaby"" doing on here? The song wasn't even a single.It's not even really all that good in my opinion.That was just a wasted space,for a better song that could have been on here.Overall,this CD is okay...but far from great.I recommend you just pick up his Greatest Hits 1 and 2 CDs instead of this."
4,Two Good Movies,"""Red Dragon"" is the first movie in the Hannibal Lecter series and is a very good film. ""End of Days"" is a good movie that has Arnold vs. the Devil. Pick this set up of you like dark mysteries. Both Dvds are loaded with special features because they are under the Collector's Edition title."
4,Manners Made Silly,Penguin has some silly animal friends who have a much needed manner make-over. A great read when discussing table manners.
5,must read,"If you have a daughter(s) this is a must read to learn how important you are in their future. This read hits on areas I never thought of, much less know how they would impact my daughters life choices. Do yourself a favor and spend the few dollars and make a positive change in how your daughter sees you. She indeed is watching."
4,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read,"As a new dad with a 2 1/2 year old girl (and 7 mo. old boy), this book has really driven home what an important role a father plays in his daughter's life. The suggestions in this book are right on the money per my wife's reactions after reading it. I highly recommend this book to ANY father serious about giving his daugther the foundation she needs for a successful and fulfilled life."
4,Great Book!,"I read this book on the recomendation of Dave Ramsey and listening to Dr. Meeker in a recent interview. This book is an easy read that will challenge you as a father and as a husband. After reading this book, it made me look at how I am around my daughter and how it will affect her life in the future. I would suggest to any father that is really looking to make a difference in the life of his daughter."
4,excellent guide,"This is an excellent book. A guide for fathering girls. It is a little redundant in making points but does illustrate how important certain things are in raising a daughter. Overall, a good book for a father to read if he is serious about raising his daughter to be a well adjusted young lady and about having a loving relationship with his daughter."
1,Should be called Right Wing Conservative Fathers & Daughters,"This book does not offer advice based on current research into parenting - it's more a loving dedication to the author's own father who was clearly a strict, conservative disciplinarian. Disappointing, considering it's written by a doctor."
1,"Nice Title, Bad Book","This book came highly recommended, but is just full of moralizing and threats of doom, rather than helpful adivce about how to communicate with your daughter or help her grown in a strong young woman. The author has a very particular set of values that she wants you to impose on your daughter, which do not leave room for a diversity of beliefs. There are much better books out there on having a good relationship with your kids, such as Gordon's Parent Effectiveness Training."
1,I don't reccomend this book.,I couldn't get my husband to finish reading this book. I finally picked up the book and started reading. Then I realized why he didn't want to finish it because it was poorly written.
1,Disappointing,"The author has some good advice, but as a (none-practicing) Muslim it was difficult to accept the ""teach her about God"" part, where the author admits she is assuming the reader is either Christian or Jewish. I think religion has done nothing but fuel hatred and violence. I have no intention of using 'God' as the more reliable father figure my daughter can depend on. Author would have been better advised to keep religion out."
3,Good Information - Doesn't Flow,"I am used to reading novels, spy mysteries, etc... Those books that you can't put down because you want to know what will happen next. This book is not like that, it is more like an instructional book. I had to force myself to read it. On my third try, I finally got through it. There is alot of good, eye opening information, and alot of common sense stuff. My daughter is turning 8 this year and I am glad that I read this book early in her life."
2,"Mostly Practical Advice - However, seems written with conservative christians in mind","If you can get through the conservative christian theme (sex education within public education is harmful to daughters, some scripture quotes, etc) there are some great suggestions offered by the author. The book is easy to read and the approach is somewhat old fashioned but effective. The author encourages fathers to stay connected with their daughters, set boundaries, make age appropriate supervision, basically to stay involved. I agree with the premise that today's culture has far too much violence, materialism, and kids are exposed to inappropriate sexual material through movies, video games, clothing. Other than that I do not agree with the author's belief that sex education within the public school system is harmful for girls. The author basically puts the responsibility on the parents to guide children to adulthood - and I certainly agree with that."
5,A Must Read,"For that segment of the population that thinks men are obsolete, this book will open a few eyes. Men are crucial to the rearing of children, offering unique gifts to boys and girls, gifts that cannot be provided by a mother. Dr. Meeker focuses on the need for fathers in the raising of daughters, and she has validated my own thoughts, while offering some new ones. My daughter is almost eight... and I intend to be waiting on the porch with a shotgun for the first pimply-faced adolescent male who walks up the steps. The author tells me that I alone stand between my daughter and American pop culture. That's enough to get my adrenaline up!"
2,"""Christian fundamentalist fathers"" should have been part of the title","I definitely wish I had read the negative reviews prior to purchasing this book. I bought it for my husband to read, and just whole section on ""angels are real and I know it, because so many terminally ill children say they've seen one"" is going to turn him off completely. Whatever good ideas there are in that book, they are completely obscured by the author's personal, religious anti-sex-ed propaganda, the use of double standards, and scare techniques. There's a lovely little passage about ""imagine yourself picking up a playboy to relax after a day of hunting with your buddies and discovering that centerfold with the hot bod has your daughter's face!"" I won't even go into that. Anyway, I wish I had read all the reviews and noticed that this book isn't aimed at the general audience, but rather at a very narrow one."
3,Good but not great,"If ""Odd Girl Out"" and ""Queen Bees and Wannabes"" were written for New York Times readers, then this book was written for New York Post readers - more conservative and less intellectual. I liked it and there's some good common sense stuff in here. But some of the ""research"" it relies on is very weak. I recommend reading it, but in conjunction with others like the two I mention. Get different perspectives."
5,Powerful Presentation,Reading this book gave me insights into how I need to take a pro-active role in my granddaughter's maturation. It is refreshing to see confirming evidence for positions I believe to be in the best interests of our youth. This is empowering stuff.
5,The most important book I've ever purchased,"I never realized how important my relationship was with my daughter until I read this book. This book has had a HUGE impact on me and the way that I look at my daughter. I've given this book to 5 or 6 other dads, and they say the same thing."
5,Should be given out at the hospital,"Wow, its good to know someone still thinks you actually need a father in today's world. The information is very straight forward and overwhelming, but overwhelming in a way that fathers need. I teach high school in a public school, so most of the information did not surprise me. However, it is presented in a way that makes you take seriously what it is you have signed up for when you had a child. The way the media assaults traditional values, it is good to have not only a different perspective but the correct perspective! Morals are not relative; there is still right and wrong. It is uplifting to hear from a lady that men are still an important part of raising a family. Again, it should be required reading for all fathers."
4,excellent,"As someone whose own father died when I was 7, this was a very poignant book to read. It's never too early or too late for all fathers to read how important they really are to their daughters' future & happiness. I bought this as a baby shower gift to the Dad :)"
2,"Some good, some bad...","just reading the table of contents, you can get a an idea...some good concepts. but why do the authors insist on bringing superstition into it? How can teaching a child god myths be good for them? Morality...yes, mythology as truth, no."
2,"Almost pure junk, but it has a little heart.","As a man with a young daughter I was hoping this book would provide a bit of perspective on the relationship between father and daughter. My family is filled with sons, I am the only member of my family in this generation blessed with a daughter and was looking for a little advice. Unfortunately this is one preachy tome. It tells you that your daughter will grow up to be a drug using slut unless you attend church with her and teach her ""gods values"". It gets one extra star because it does rightly say that the bond between a father and daughter should be valued by both of you. Instead of using this book as a guide talk to your child and her friends not at them. Chances are they'll be just fine."
5,great book!,My husband read this book when our twin daughters were infants and he loved it. I havent read it yet but i plan to :)
2,Borrow it if you really want to - but don't buy it.,This book is okay but it is somewhat preachy. She states a lot of her opinions as fact. She does make some nice valid points but somewhat too conservative for everyone's taste.Overall it's a bit over rated.My husband wasn't too impressed either.
1,"Disappointing, alarmist, and overly conservative","I guess I should have read ""all"" of the reviews before I bought this book, but alas, I did not. I read the first 25-30 pages and immediately felt like I was reading a book written by an overly conservative parent that was scared of everything. I also could not align myself with her overt religious and sometimes ignorant positions. While I am raising my kids as religious children, I don't want them to be religious kids hoping for a 1950s America that very few people actually ever experienced. RETURNED FOR A REFUND."
2,"Good concept, but Bizarrely Preoccupied with Sex","I like the idea of this book, the problem is it is SO conservative and moralistic that it is suffocate itself under its own heaviness.What is very interesting, though, is the obsessive attention it gives to sexuality. Seriously, like half of the book deals with abstinence, and pre-marital sex, abortion, etc etc. Sure SOME of this is part of being a parent, but HALF?!"
5,I have wanted this book for a long time.,"I've listened to interviews with the author, and have wanted this book for a long time. I finally bought a copy for me and a few others for my adult children who have daughters."
4,A book every father of a daughter should read,"It's written from a woman's perspective, which is one of the most impactful aspects of it. Very eye opening and ultimately empowering as a father."
4,Good book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It gives a lot of insight into the significant role a father plays in his daughter's life and how important these roles are as she grows into an adult. Additionally it draws a lot of conclusions based on the authors experiences as a physician and working with a lot of children who have had good and bad experiences.The author does very well at integrating stories that she has experienced or witnessed from various patients into the book to emphasize her point as well as offering a change of pace from the otherwise ""opinion supported by research"" format the rest of the book assumes.My one critique of this book is it's very repetitive regarding anorexia and several other topics that it seems that the author is very passionate about. While understandable there are numerous pages that could be deleted as they are repetitive or similar in topic and emphasis.That aside I think that this book is a solid read and worth a look."
4,Father of Three Daughters Says 'Read This Book',"I'm a father of three daughters ages 1, 2 and 3. A friend recommended this book to me as a peek at 'the road ahead', and he was absolutely right. It's a scary read at points, but like a good tonic, a necessary spoonful of advice. As the book points out, our girls grow up in a toxic world that wants to pull them in directions that aren't necessarily the best for them. Fathers play a critical role in the development and continued happiness of daughters. I recommend this book to fathers of young girls."
2,Just Okay,"I have read several books by very well-informed, educated people on this subject. This medical doctor gives good advice concerning medical facts as well as views on her own experiences. However, she is not a child psychiatrist. She does not maintain objectivity on the subject to give a balanced viewpoint. When she starts spewing the ""God doctrine"" as if that's the only way to go, she lost me completely. Men and women alike can be very caring, dedicated parents without the inference of ""God"" in their lives. I do agree on one main point. Men have to step-up and be proactive fathers whether they have sons or daughters. Too many men run away from their responsibilities. Mothers can't do it alone. It's tough road to walk and too many kids fall through the cracks because of runaway dads. That's the real crux of the problem."
1,A mediocre attempt for justification of a very one-sided approach,"As a first-time father decided to get this book since it did look promising at first. Unfortunately should have checked out the one-star reviews. This is a terribly written book, based on questionable statistics. The ""scientific evidence"" that the author claims support her beliefs is questionable at best. It manipulates the facts and misleads readers into thinking that there is tons of evidence in support of her views. Just check the references -- statement after statement refers to the same book or study.In one word -- mediocrity."
2,Not what you expect,"i agree with one reviewer where they mentioned that""this book is that it doesn't offer the enlightening advice I thought it might. Instead, this book is centered on the idea that traditional values and hard work are the keys to understanding your daughter's problems""... this is absolutely true. It basically states the obvious with no new advice or guidelines.over all a disappointment."
4,Great message,"This may not be the most perfectly written book that I've ever read, but the message is great. Anything that helps fathers to learn how to bond with their daughter(s) is a good thing in my book!"
5,Wonderful Read,I cannot recommend this book enough for any father of daughters. I consider this book a textbook for fathering and plan to refer to this book every year as my daughters grow.
5,great tips,"Great book for dads and moms. Great understanding of the female brain. Good for most guys with girlfriends, wives or sisters too."
5,Thank God for this book!,"This seller was very efficient, received the book in amazing timing (just in time for Father's Day). I purchased this book as a gift and I reading it with my boyfriend who is a father to a 10 y/o girl. He is not the primary parent so he has to sift through the hurdles of seperated parents and spending time with his daughter. This book is an excellent and powerful read. I myself had an astranged relationship with my father and a lot of the nuggets that this author delivers has verbalized a lot of my own personal revelations of my development with the lack of a father. I love this book, I believe it offers some much needed insight and perspective for fathers to really take their relationship with their daughters to the next level. Fathers......WE NEED YOU!"
5,Great book for Dads!,This book was recommended by a friend and I am glad it was recommended. It is a good read and an eye opener for any dad. I would encourage the purchase of this book.
3,not very multicultural,"It's not just ""beautiful blonde-haired girls"" that need to be supported by their dads. This book could have been written to reach out to a wider cultural audience."
5,Great information for fathers with youn or old girls,"I thought the book was very well written. It gave me a lot of good points to think about. The main one that comes to mind is to be involved with your daughters life. Wether she like it or not. The author of this book did not say this but many of her stories reminded me of the saying that ""your parents get smarter the older you get"""
5,MUST READ!!,"I was recommended by a good friend to read this book and I am glad I did. Being a first-time father of a little girl, this book has opened my eyes to the immense impact a father has on his daughter's life. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a daughter or is about to. Mothers would benefit from this read as well. ""Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters"" has opened my eyes!"
5,AWESOME Book,"To my fellow dads: you MUST buy and read this book. It is excellent - easy to read and will blow your socks off. As a dad, I knew some of the things she talks about in the book. What I found was a LOT of reaffirmation that I am doing the right thing - and some help in shoiwng me things I had not thought if. Finally it clearly shows the impact - the power - the long term results of what I am and am not doing. If you love your daughter, buy this book"
5,"Great, Great Book for Dads","I've got a wonderful daughter which is why I picked up Dr. Meeker's Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters.This is a good book - comforting, wise and filled with observations from a long standing pediatrician that will underscore how important a strong dad is in a girl's life. Strong in terms of being willing to set appropriate rules, live a good example, instill respect of self and parent and foster the type of communication that enables the young lady in your life to know she has a supportive and loving Dad always there for her.The bottom line is that your daughter is watching and listening to you even during those years when you're convinced her mind is always a million miles away. Dr. Meeker makes a great case about how your interactions with your daughter in a loving parent role will help make a strong and confident young lady and woman in later years.It sounds trite, but every dad should read this."
5,Another great book,"I purchased this book for my husband since we have two daughters to raise. He is having a tough time putting down this book! He reads and re-reads some parts all the time and we are now able to calmly discuss how we should manage our children's behaviour, activities, and time.Again Amazon is a wonderful site to buy books!!"
2,Not for everybody,"I state it honestly: I don't like McFarlane's drawings. To me he draws people with potato-like heads. To me strokes of his pencil are unsteady and trembling. Don't take me wrong: he is not bad, objectively, more: he is professional, yes, but just not in my taste. My Spider-Man is one of John Romita Sr., Gil Kane, Ross Andru and, say, John Byrne. If yours is the same, then don't buy this book."
1,Muy pobre historia,"Primero que nada, no me gusta el estilo de McFarlane, de repente funciona en Spawn pero no se como a otro superheroe le puede servir una capa de 40 metros, pero en fin. No hay nada que pueda rescatar de este numero, el argumento es terrible, una bruja que hace cosas malas, listo. El arte no es bueno, nunca vi un Lizard tan feo y aparte las composiciones de las paginas no quedan bien. Felizmente pude venderlo porque me doleria conservar este TPB en mi coleccion."
2,Aptly Named,The book was aptly named as reading it was indeed a torment. What the heck kind of story was that? Todd McFarlane should just stick to drawing (although the art wasn't all that good in this book either) and not write the stories. It was boring boring and boring... not like Spidey at all. Don't waste your money on this...
3,time consumes all,"I read this story arc when it was released, when McFarlane ruled the comic artist scene.Now after a lot of good writers/artists runs on many books, this story lost freshness(in the art, too)"
5,It helped us !,I was charged with setting up a CVS setup for our company and have found the book very helpful in explaining things like how to set up a repository and install CVS properly on solaris. I've been reading through the chapters on building and tagging and found the way forward.Usually the book comes to the rescue when we find we need to extend our use and knowledge of CVS a step further. What more can I say ?
4,Two books in one,"Sort of two books in one. The chapters alternate between a tutorial on installing, administering and using CVS, and chapters on the principles of open source development. It helped us get our CVS server up and running. I'm finding lots of similarities between open source development and our own distributed development efforts, so the material is interesting and useful."
3,deadly wrong point,"The author made a deadly mistake. He said ""cvs update -j branch"" will not work for multiple times merge and use ""cvs update -j change_tag_2 -j change_tag_1"" instead. But the right answer is that ""cvs update -j branch"" will remember the last time stop point and start there. No repeat over problem at all. And ""cvs update -j change_tag_2 -j change_tag_1"" command will undo all chnge made between that two version.This is not trival error, is'it?"
2,Poorly Written,"Unfortunately, the book was poorly written and rather confusing to following. The book had no flow to it all and to read it straight through without additional reference material and a system to work on would have left me even more disappointed. The book overall appears to have been thrown together for a quick buck. Was their an editor involved in this project? Getting and installing CVS is in Chapter four! There are only nine chapters and the ninth chapter is a ref. chapter.There is some decent information in the book but its definitely not my sole reference. My advice for a newcomer like myself to CVS is to look around for additional books and if you have money to spare get this one."
4,"Great game, if it did not run so choppy!!!","This is a very cool game and definitely is in the league of the other great FPS games out there today. The only problem that I have encountered that takes away from the fun, are the problems that I have even with somewhat of a fast computer. As the game progresses, it slows down due to the clutter of the people you kill etc...You definitely need 256RAM to truly enjoy the game the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Once you don't have to worry about the glitches, the environments are very cool and will keep you interested for a long time. The people are very realistic and have true to life physics in the way they fall when they are shot or blown up."
1,Cheap and boring,"This game had good potential but it turned out to be a cheap, low budget, and boring game. All you do is run through what is basically a maze and shoot whatever enemies you find before they shoot you.If you want a good game of a similar genre get Rainbow-Six Raven Shield or wait for SWAT 4 to come out. They will be more expensive but worth it."
1,You cant judge a game by its cover.,"I bought this on its release date just by looking at its cover. There is no introduction to game play and they just throw you onto the game. The videos played but no sound could be heard so you just have to guess what your mission is. I returned mine beacuse of a defect (the video sound). Stick to Half-Life, The Rainbow 6 series, Swat 3, or Operation Flash Point if you want a tried and true first person shooter."
1,Don't Bother,"This game is bogus. The graphics and game play are horrible. I played for 4 hours and could't get past the second level. I am a big fan of rist person shooters, and let me tell you this is the worst one I've played. Don't waste good hard earned money on it!"
1,Oh my God FPS's dont get much worse.,"(...)I bought this game without reading reviews or anything, I thought it looked cool so i got it. Pop it in...ok looks cool enough. Ok I didnt get past the first mission, so thats all i can base this on. The screen flickered and there was a lot of lag, even though I have a brand new Sony Vaio!! There is no reason for anyone to buy this game when there are so many better games out there. Dont even buy it if you've bought Rainbow 6, Delta Force, and all those other great games and you're curious. WAIT FOR ANOTHER FPS TO COME ALONG, ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!! You'll thank me for telling you this."
1,horrible game,This is the worst game I have ever played Its so hard I cant even do any thing beacase I try and the enemy shouts me imedeitly. DO NOT BUY!
3,laggy but has potential,"The ONLY reason that I rate this game average is because it lags wayyyyyy too much. I have a 3dfx video card, voodoo sound card, 152 MB of RAM (much more than it calls for) and gigs of hard drive space. With that, i shut down all un-needed system resources and it STILL lagged very badly. However, the game is realistic, has a wide variety of guns such as the mp5k,mossberg 590DA pump action 12 gauge shotgun, stoner sr-25, RPG, sig-sauer in .357 magnum, FN-FAL, glock .45 caliber, Uzi, mac-10, ak-47,m-4 carbine and MANY others. From what my computer could handle, the game was awsome and makes you feel like the movie ""Black Hawk Down"" was. So if you have a computer with a fast processer, megs of RAM, and powerful video and sound card ... DO NOT hesitate to buy this game"
3,someone,"this game is very hard. i have had it for almost a year and haven't got past the first level. the graphics are good and the weapons are cool to. it is very hard ,and if you aren ot that good at first person shooter games, DON""T BUY IT!"
2,DONT waste your money,"I bought this game thinking it would be in the league of SWAT 3. In 2 hours of playing it, I'm barely able to reach the 2nd level of the mission. To start, I'm running a pentium 4 1.6GHZ, to a 19 inch trinitron, backed up with a Nividia Geforce3 TI series graphics card, and I STILL had problems with the video lag. The game play is fast paced, sloppy, and like someone else said on this site, uninvolved. They throw you into the game like it's some sort of Doom game. However...for 10 bucks this game is WELL worth it. It's got cool weapons, decent graphics when the screen isnt flooded, and it may keep you interested for a few days. For 30 bucks, look elsewhere, I suggest SWAT 2, or SWAT 3.**UPDATE**For this price, you MIGHT wanna try this game. It was more expensive when I bought it (blindly without reading reviews) and I was upset when I wrote my review!! Its NOT a great game, but this is fairly [inexpensive] for a game, so if your bored and have everything else, why not"
4,Good cd for the money.,"This one is preferable over the ""All Time Greatest"", simply because it has ""Devil in the Bottle"" to go along with the eight others duplicated on both cd's. My main gripe with this one is that they felt it necessary to include the remake of Bryan Adams' cheesy power ballad ""Everything I Do (I Do it For You). Why they felt compelled to include the throwaway novelty hit ""Make My Day"" and ""Mr. D.J."" is also a mystery. Still, as long as you've got the stereo remote handy you can skip those."
4,This CD Made My Day,"Don't know why all of the complaining about the novelty song Make My Day, I happen to buy this CD specifically for that one song! To each his/her own, right? I like that they are ""original recordings"", not remakes."
3,"Another ""crossover"" artist","Most of the hits presented here can also be found on the Top 100POP hits of the Billboard charts. Formerly in the 50's and 60's thatwas a general fact although the songs then were pure country and crossedover because everybody loved that kind of music. Later on during thethe 80's & 90's, crossover artist sang a mixture of ""some"" C&W; rootswith a lot of modern POP something I personally do not like. That'sthe reason of the 3 stars. I love C&W; and I Love POP as well as BLUESand HONKY TONK but each kind of music in its own way. How come thatwonderful singers like Gene Watson, Johnny Duncan, Ricky van Shelton,Don Williams and so many others never ""crossed over"" ? They aregenuine country artists!"
1,Wrong edition than one listed.,The Edition sent to me of this book was the edition printed in 1942...it is not the original 1909 1st edition from the turn of the century that I thought I was being sent. Very disappointed. I already have several copies of the 1942 printed edition. I will be returning the product.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Daredevil is involved in a personal war with the Kingpin. Said crimelord is getting pretty sick of the horned guy, and sets out to ruthlessly destroy him, one piece of his life at a time. Having discovered his identity as Matt Murdoch, this becomes an even easier task.The Kingpin only makes one mistake, when the assassins he hires to bump off Matt fail to do the deed comprehensively."
4,very nice chairs,"a bit smaller than I expected, but very comfortable and much better than a folding metal chair. Fold up nicely"
4,An good introduction to a country music legend.,"Dottie West is best-known for her duets with Kenny Rogers and her stormy life history - born poor, molested by her father, married young, struggled as a singer-songwriter, broke through to stardom, married a much younger man, filed for bankruptcy, died in a car accident - that was dramatically brought to the screen by Michelle Lee. This CD should remind us that Ms. West was also a heck of a country-pop singer. Though this CD lacks her early material (see The Essential Dottie West for that) it has some good material from her ""sexy mama"" period. I only wish the CD had more photos of West, with her flashy Bob Mackie outfits, of course. Defintely a treat."
5,Fantastic Budget Collection of Vintage Dottie West,"This budget collection is an appealing mix of actual ""greatest hits"" from the career of country legend Dottie West and a choice selection of fine covers of other people's hits. The first six songs are Dottie classics including three number one hits, A LESSON IN LEAVIN', ARE YOU HAPPY BABY, and WHAT ARE WE DOIN' IN LOVE. One of the highlights of the package is Dottie's 1977 hit remake of the charming 1920's pop song TONIGHT YOU BELONG TO ME. The last six songs are covers of songs by Kenny Rogers, Larry Gatlin, and others. These tracks I believe are only available on CD on this collection although they were on her vinyl albums from 25 years ago. A very nice buy set from one of the true queens of country music."
2,Not her greatest hits,"This disappointing CD has very few of Dottie's greatest hits, and a lot of her doing covers of hit songs from other artists in overproduced versions that are not as good as the originals. If you want a better collection, I recommend ""The Essential Dottie West."" At this writing, it's out of print, so get a used copy."
5,great toy reviewe,"i really did not like this toy because on the picture on the net it shows thta it comes with a pouch, but it does not! i was really mad when i figured that out! you can get this product for less at the stores, because here it costs 22.00-29.00 dollars, and outside it costs only 15.00 dollars, and here on this site you also have to pay for shiping and handeling! but over all i had a lot of fun with thish toy!"
1,Cheaply constructed train,"My son purchased this train with the money received from his ""first communion"" and anxiously awaited it's arrival.When my husband removed it from the box, the wheels fell off of one of the locomotives. My husband reattached and built the track with my son. While trying to couple the cars, two couplings broke off the cars.My son was very disappointed with this train and I am very upset with the quality, construction and durability of this item."
3,Yellow discoloration,"I ordered the Opaque Red and it came with yellowing of the plastic. See my ""customer images"". Luckily it's function is to be a spare mask."
1,The Author Caught Lying,"This book by the late William Barclay is quite infomative...that is until I read the chapter on The Parable of the Good Samaritan: the author made a few unacceptable and baseless assertations. He insisted that the lonely traveller who was robbed was RECKLESS in travelling alone. There is absolutely no basis for making this interpretation. Travelling alone doesn't mean that the person HAS TO BE reckless. This opinion is entirely the author's personal one.The next part of the parable's interpretation is even more absurd: the author blantantly assume that the Buddha and Prophet Muhammed would not lift a finger to help that robbed traveller had he met them. I wonder where on earth the author got this idea from? Had the author still be alive today, this is what I'll say to him: You don't do Christ any good by slandering the Buddha and Prophet Muhammed.In conclusion, this book is written by a bigotory 'holier-than-thou' minister."
4,Tomart's Price Guide to Radio Premiums,"I purchased this book used, and it arrived promptly and in new condition in all respects. It is a 1991 edition and I don't know if there is a later one. My purpose was to get an idea of what things on e-bay are worth to help me with bidding, but there doesn't seem to be much correlation between e-bay sell prices and the book. On the other hand, everything I've looked for is included the Tomart book- it is very complete and has at least given me a rough idea of where to start with bidding. Considering the age of the book's edition, I've added 15% to values shown and that seems to get somewhat into the ballpark of true values. All in all, for the price I paid, I got my money's worth."
4,Neo-Rockabilly revival band,"Mystery Psycho/Neo band from the UK is now available on CD. The quintet formed after two local bands disbanded. The musicians met in a bar, drank some beer and decided to form a new Psycho band.The Go-Katz released one EP ""The Go-Katz E.P."", and a few tracks on compilations: ""Psycho Attack Over Europe!"", ""Psycho Tendencies""... This CD contains all their recorded material.Some great songs, but the music seems not to be very outstanding, especially if you want to hear something original."
4,Blenheim Palace Rocks?,"I remember visiting Blenheim Palace quite a bit in the early to mid 80's and too bad they didn'have concerts like this back then. Then again I was in the USAF and we were dodging Peace Keepers at RAF Upper Heyford, but that's another story. Young and not too cocky, Jamie Cullum's performance is a definite treat. The camera angles and close up shots of Jamie playing the piano is to be commended. The crisp music along with the close up shots will leave you glued to your tube and wanting more. Jamie and his band mates put on a great show."
1,Disappointed,"Twentysomething is a nice brilliant jazz CD. This concert DVD is ridiculous! The whole time I was watching this, I wished the boy what sit down and play the piano and stop jumping around and gyrating all over the stage! Jamie was pounding and standing on top of the piano! It was more of a Rock concert then a Jazz concert. Disappointed!!"
5,I Can't Wait To See This!,Update: I got the DVD on Tuesday and it lived up to all my expectations and in some cases surpassed them. It proves what an innovative and entertaining musician he is. Just what I needed to tie me over until he comes back over to tour in the states next year.For everyone who does know Jamie Cullum and has been to one of his live gigs there is no need for me to explain why I am so excited to see this :) For those of you who don't know who Jamie Cullum is (go buy his CD right now! :) ) or if you haven't been to a live gig...it is an amazing almost life changing experience (ok...only life changing for us die hard fans haha but he still changes the way you will view concerts). The way he performs his songs are unlike any other performer out there. He exudes energy and charisma...jumping around the stage and on the piano. His voice is just so beautiful and he is AMAZING. I have seen him twice live and I still can't get enough of it! I can't wait to see this incredible DVD.
3,Classic Doom2 for DOS,"Doom2 survives the test of time. Doom2 does require expertise with DOS and decaying DOS support after Windows 95 (DOS 7) makes this DOS version game more difficult to run properly, but for those who could run it, it is an excellent game still."
5,Difficulty playing Doom in XP,"I have owned this game for years and love it! But recently I bought a new computer with Windows XP and was severly dissapointed to find out that DOOM II doesn't not function completing in XP.The biggest problem is the mouse. I doesn't work no matter what I do. I did all configurations at the beginning of the game, but with no luck. Then I read somewhere that the game doesn't recognize a USB mouse. So I bought an old school 6-pin mouse. But the mouse still doesn't work. It must be a problem with the XP ops system.I've also emailed Id, the software maker, but have received no response. Does anyone have an answer to this enigma?"
4,Fun,"This game is fun, challenging, difficult, creepy, and the only game I've ever liked, but gets boring real easily unless you use cheats. The graphics are well done and the game has well arcitecture and animated characters. The music is kewl, and the sound is OK. Alright, multiplayer is a blast, especially in coop. The demons, and mayhem is just intensifyingly addicting. I love this game. It's cool!"
4,Old School,"Since I've been reviewing all of the newer blood bathes I thought I'd go back and review this one as well. Doom and Doom II are just about where it all started. Everything that came after them had to live up to a standard. You can't get more classic then this. Although graphics and gameplay have improved with all the newer games, there's nothing like going a few rounds in an old standby. May Doom live forever :)"
4,Great for its day,"I had tons of fun with this game in '95 and I still play it today, although I've beaten it many times. It is very predictable once you've played it a few times but the multiplayer experience is great. If you've got a slow computer and can't play Quake III or Unreal Tournament, or simply want some old fashioned fun then this is a great game for you."
3,Okay,"Not that big of an improvement over the original. This sequel is in a 'more of the same' vein. The additions are not that big a deal: there are a few new monsters. Most are pretty cut and dry, save for the fiendish Arch-Vile (who can both ressurect fallen foes and burn you up) and the new weapon.. the Super Shotgun... is a lovely upgrade, but more detail to upgrade would have carried a long way.However, this does not make Doom 2 a 'bad' game. Yes, it is technically 'more of the same', but in the case of the Doom series, that is really a good thing.The original Doom's gameplay was a thrilling ride with a few bumps along the way (namely: overbearing keycard hunting) and this sequel is no different."
3,Doom1 still better,Bottom line if your gonna buy this buy the first one first to see if you like the dooms this is not the one to start off with!
5,the best,"I`m from Spain, so my english is not quite good. So I`ll be brief; it is the best game EVER."
4,Trial of the Heart is a fantastic love story and lesson,"I really got into this book, I just couldn't but it down. I thought it was a great story and should be made into a movie. But I have to admitt I don't know any college kids with a food storage supply, as this book suggests!! I have highly recommended this book to all of my friends and I recommend it to you."
5,Insight without mumbo-jumbo nonsense,"I actually give this book a rating of six stars. Very readable, practical knowledge without the condescending attitude that many software management or process books impart. I found myself putting those little tab markers on every chapter until I realized they were going ON EVERY CHAPTER. Just read the whole thing. It is a fast read and each chapter is a quick insight into best and worst practices in the industry. jj"
4,Give it to your boss,The argument in this book is that you should treat your employees well and give them lots of space and privacy. Sounds good to me!
1,Very disappointing,"I expected the book to contain practical advice. The book covered many undesirable situations and business settings. There were no recommendations made on how to improve a bad situation. The book merely reported on the bad environment. If you are in an unpleasant work environment and want to know there may be others worse off then you, you may like this book."
2,Bad printing quality,"I am happy with its contents, but the printing quality on this particular edition is just horrible. The cover page looks blurry even when it's brand new and clean, and many pages are grayish and scratchy, as if the whole book was made by a photocopy machine. If you like a decent book, at least do not buy this edition."
3,A solid look at the role of people in a company,"This book takes a look at the role people, specifically creative people, play in a company. It offers various insights into management, the environment, and team ""building"". The second edition also adds a final section with eight new chapters with later insights.While I agreed with much of what was written, there were some noticeable gaps such as mentoring, and business training (as opposed to technical training). Also, some of the content was, at this point, cliché (such as not treating people as widgets or, specifically, creative people as factory line workers, and the value of team ""jelling"").Nonetheless, there is original content, and thoughtful suggestions, and the book is an enjoyable read."
5,Required reading,"To prevent becoming one of those clueless bosses, spend an afternoon or two and commit this book to memory. It's right for any office-based, technical business, not just software development."
5,Extraordinary book,"Peopleware is a book that needs to be read by ALL people related to software development; not just managers and developers.It has created plenty of debate between people in my company because of the 'saving on space' issue; also, some people from my company doesn't yet understand why a developer cannot be treated like a soldier (strict regime); this book helps out to understand such issues (and much more!).Also it has been written in a pleasant and fast way to read. ¡Excellent piece of work!The remaining only issue:It doesn't talk anything about the process of selling. Eventhough it's not a 'Sellingware' book, I think it deserves one chapter, just to create a link with the people that are in charge of generating money to support the 100 square feet that each programmer needs."
2,Showing its age,"This is the book whose title has become synonymous with managing teams in software companies. Though this 2nd edition came out in 1999, most of the content is identical to that of the original 1987 edition. 22 years later, that's a problem. So much of our common practices and conventional wisdom have changed (in part due to the impact of this book) that much of the advice in the book is obsolete. True, gems like the inverse relationship between noise and code quality will likely stay relevant for a century, but most of this book is about getting programmers to work together. The fact is, today's programmer is a different beast from the programmer of the '80s.For more up-to-date material, you might look to theJoel on Softwarebooks, or any number of blogs."
1,Missing whole chapters!!! What's the deal?,"I've heard so much about what an excellent book this is, so I finally ordered it.I'm paging through, liking what I see. However, I checked the index for a particular subject, attempt to go to the page, and, IT'S NOT THERE!I paid full price for this book and am missing about 8 Chapters!Needless to say, I am VERY disappointed with Amazon that something like this could happen! Quality Control, were you napping?I will be returning the book. I will not be purchasing it again from Amazon for fear that the replacement will also be missing pages."
2,to heavy and unconfortable,i gave this sandals two stars just becuse they fit.thats about the only good thing about them
2,Cheap quality,This bedding was terribly made. As soon as I washed it all the stitching came out. It faded and looked so old after one wash. Something that is made for toddler should be much more deriable.
4,nice design,I liked the design and the bright colors but the comforter is too thin. You will need a blanket underneath especially in the cold months.
2,4X4 Off-Road Adventure 2,"I got this after playing the first one over a year earlier.If you can get your hands on the first release - do it!I was hoping that this one would be more like that - slow and technical, just you and the terrain - but it's more of a race-like game w/o opponents.The first release was very technical and more like actually four-wheeling. You had a winch and you HAD to use it. The maps were smaller but much slower and more techinical.I was very dissapointed."
3,Fun but Short,I really injoy this game. It's a pretty realistic off-road game that you go off-road finding checkpoints. The only downside is you can complete the game in 6-8 hrs easy. You can always go back and play through again thow.
4,War of Words,"I wonder if some of the negative and anonymous reviewers below live at 740 Park? Or have some sort of personal grudge? Have they actually read this book? I have. This is no clip job. Gross interviewed hundreds of people--almost all of them named. And speeaking of names, isn't it kind of odd that all the reviewers who signed their real names say it is very accurate? And all the screeds are anonymous? Just asking."
1,Truly Awful,"With 740 Park, Michael Gross has produced another prosaic nose-pressed-up-against-the-glass chronicle of a world in which he's only a guest (ala Ron Kessler). It's truly a waste of time to read and a waste of money to buy. Any legitimate author would be ashamed to crank out such nonsense."
2,Yawn...,"Don't be fooled by the exciting sounding ""apartment porn"" review by Forbes -- this is one tedious book. While there were some very interesting sections (on the building's architect Candela, a brief history of cooperative apartments in NYC, and John D. Rockefeller), they were few and far between. The majority of the text is dull and repetitive. The author was able to get dirt on a number of current and former residents of 740 Park, but he could not get his hands on a floor plan or any decent photos of these luxurious apartments? All in all, quite a disappointing read."
2,No Photos and Plodding Writing,"When I read a book like this one, that describes the history of a building or how the rich are very different from you and I, I want photos to help fill out the story. This book contains two mediocre pictures of two different rooms in the fabled structure on Madison where only the super rich can reside. I pass by this building every day and was naturally curious to see what all the shouting was about. To me, it looks like hundreds of other bland, brick structures that line Park and Fifth Avenue. Perhaps that's the first tip-off that the ultra-rich want to live quietly behind barricades of stone and marble. I wish there were pictures of the some of the residents and the interiors. Word descriptions can only go so far."
2,A 500+ Page Gossip Column,"The author seems to be fond of hyperbole. While it is difficult to quantify social prestige in a republic, the notion that 740 Park is New York's most prestigious Cooperative is laughable at best. There are plenty of other buildings (998 & 960 Fifth, River House, at the risk of being indiscreet) that have a better claim to that title, and it makes one wonder if Mr. Gross turned his pen on the residents of 740 because they were more willing to talk than others.It's true many of the tales have been told before and Mr. Gross' writing style will never equal the acerbic wit of Andrew Alpern or the folksy storytelling of Jerry Patterson and Stephen Birmingham in their chronicles of the apartment-dwelling rich and the book reads like an extended gossip column, which some may adore and others may loathe. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a gossipy read about the rich and shameless this book will not disappoint."
3,More photos would have made it more interesting,"Like the other reviewers here, I too found some passages tedious and repetitive. Seemed like the author just didn't get his teeth into the book....kind of like he just ""whetted"" the appetite. Since I purchased this on this website, I was hoping to see lots of photos but that's not the case. That was disappointing. It was still an interesting read about people who have too much money and sometimes, too much time on their hands. Does anyone need a 76 room 3 story apartment where only 2 people live?"
2,My head is spinning,"I'm on pg 184, and vow to get to the end, but I don't expect it to be easy. Like the other comments, I agree that pictures would have been wonderful to include, just so I could attempt to keep some of these people straight. This book gets so weighed down with names, and they've become a blur. Junior Rockefeller was interesting, but all the names of each and every lawyer and law firm and decorators and whatnot it just bogs it all down.I'm doing Google searches on the main people, just so I can try to paint a better mental picture.**edited - I didn't make it through the book. It's not worth my time."
1,Over-hyped by the author's friends...,"This ""history"" is an unreadable mismash of facts, fantasy and innuendo. The five star reviews are a joke."
5,Amazing,"One of the most fascinating and classy books I have ever read so far. Read it, you won't regret it."
3,Living on Park Ave.,"While I'm only about 30% into the book and do find it interesting, there are just so many names and family histories mentioned that it's difficult to keep it all straight. I feel like I should have a map and a family tree(s) in front of me just to keep track of who is who and what is where. But it is still fascinating reading - about lives most of us will never know. Perhaps that's a good thing."
3,No One Does NY Dish Better,"Michael Gross has been living in New York City his entire life. That's a nice way of saying that he comes by his real estate obsesssion naturally. All New Yorkers seem to talk about these days is where they live, where they want to live and how much it costs.That makes 740 Park is a natural subject for Gross who's got a sharp wit and fine sense of what makes his native city's power brokers tick. 740 Park is a great read for anyone wanting a history of one of the city's big name building, one of those places that almost everyone in towns wants to own but only a few - very few - even get to visit.I liked this book both for its dish and its perpective and that's a hard act to pull off successfully. Gross does a fine job."
4,Delish Dish!,"Michael Gross has a delicious flair for capturing the moneyed of Manhattan, a subject of tireless intrigue to me. His thorougly researched chronicle, salted with wit and juicy details, makes for a wonderful romp through the hallowed and exclusive halls of an urban ""gated"" community. it's a good thing gross refused to ""keep out."""
