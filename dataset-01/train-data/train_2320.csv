4,A useful Reference document,This is a useful reference that places the lives of the Roman Emperors in chronological order. The detail is useful but not onerous and it is quite an easy read.
5,Highly recommended,"Excellent resource for those interested in antiquities, western civilization and roman history."
2,Chronicles Rule!,"I bought a second one for a friend a week after the first copy arrived. Great, concise book."
5,Touching tale of struggle and strength,"The author's journey through clinical depression is illustratively depicted through his tragic words, his recovery evidenced in his insights, and his wit obvious throughout. The melody of his poems, from the melancholy strum of deep despair, to the skylit waftings of hope and promise, can resonate in the soul of everyone. This collection holds meaning for anyone who has ever loved, hurt, struggled...lived."
4,The Viking Deception continues,"Great book!!! Ms. Seaver's detective work is wonderful and thoughtful-beyond doubt. But the end of the story? NO! Read the book and then order the NOVA DVD on the same topic: ""The Viking Deception"" (available from Amazon- completed in 2005 after publication of this book and thus updates the story)...Carbon 14 tests indicate the map is on very old parchment but that parchment that may have been 'treated' prior to being used for the map in 1950, thus the priest as creator is now doubtful. If created in 1950 the 'creator' is again open to investigation and question. Lots of questions, lots of debate--great story."
2,VCD image quality,"Love Russell Peters; also have the ""outsourced"" DVD which is great quality but RWB is actually significantly better.However, the DVD is not a DVD quality but more a bad old VCD quality.It just looks like a very bad digitial downloaded version with streaks and cropped images all over the screen.It is that bad that I am sending the DVD back to Amazon as the quality is really horrible.I have 3 DVD player at home (incl bue ray) and it is not an issue of the player but the disc.I also checked the TV but all other DVD play well so I think this may be a recording/manufacturing problem?The combo pack also includes a CD whichis great but since I won't be watching the DVD again no use for the CD and I will send both back.Shame as the performance of Russell Peters is particular great."
5,One of the best DVDs ever!!!,"I love this comedian, so I'm a little biased when I rate this.He is absolutely hilarious, and there is a little comedy for everyone on this.You need to give it a shot."
3,Needs new material,"I'm a huge fan of Russell, I have his previous DVD and have seen him live twice. I was really excited about the release of this DVD, but found a lot of the material I had already heard. It was still very funny, but I was expecting so much more from such a clever funny man!"
3,"Average, repetitious","We got hooked on Russell by chance and loved his 'Outsourced' DVD. I did purchase this one with fairly high expectations and confess that I was disappointed. Here's why1. I agree most stand-up comics do this, but he was regurgitating huge amounts from past shows. It stops being so funny after a while2. Again, I expect a fair amount of vulgarity in a stand-up show, but he seems to have gotten a vocabulary-upgrade and had more than a 'fair' share of this3. Shrill NOT= Funny. Period.I did like this, but not as much as I'd hoped to. Maybe it's my fault for having high expectations, but hey, come on!"
2,Needs new material,"Most of the stuff in Red White and Brown can be found in his previous shows. You can tell that much of the audience already heard a lot of the RWB material because the laughter was not split-belly hard like it was in his old shows. It was merely polite laughter with a tinge of hopefulness that something new would be coming up, which didn't usually happen. If you've never seen his previous stuff, then RWB might be all right, but even then I would rather watch the older shows first.Disappointed fan of R. Peters"
1,"Sick ""Not-even-funny"" Comedy","I have been a big fan of Russell Peters for past few years. I was eagerly waiting for this DVD and bought it the day it came out. I am completely disappointing with it. Jokes are nothing but sick. He said some terrible things even though there was a kid in the audience. At one point, Russell even said that and his mother (I hope he was kidding on this) was also in the audience, which is even more terrible. He said repeatedly that he has a lot of money. I do not understand how that is funny or relevant to his comedy? Complete waste of time. Do check some snippets of the video to see if you like it before you buy it. My recommendation: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. Just buy this one if you haven't seen itComedy Now! Starring Russell Peters--something that (for some weird reason--oh yeah money, I thought he had a lot of it) he does not endorse."
5,sore feet,"My dad has heel spurs and has worn orthodics in his shoes for at least 20 years. As he has gotten older his feet have gotten worse, as a warehouse manager he is on his feet on concrete all day (8-14 hours) and he spends his nights with his feet on the squishy. I got it at Harriet Carter but am now buying my own from Amazon. As a mom of two I am on my feet all day too and my dad and I were sharing his but I think it's time for a second. I highly reccomend it."
2,what you want is not what you get,"I bought this for my significant other so I didn't have to rub his feet. I have arthritis in most of my joints and my hands get painful when I try to rub his callused up feet. He said that all it seems to do is vibrate his feet, not rub and flex them to release the tension. I never tried it. I wasn't happy that it took batteries and wasn't plug in. All in all it was just another thing that will just sit there till it's thrown away."
2,Weak,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend to save me from having to provide her with nightly foot rubs. She wanted a quiet machine that would ease her tired feet. I'm sad to say that only 1 week into the new year I am back on daily massage duty. While not painfully loud, the machine can be heard over both the dishwasher and the TV. And while the massaging action is not unpleasant, the same experience can be obtained by standing atop the washing machine during the spin cylce. I did try resting my neck and shoulders on it to help alleviate tension and it was better than....well nothing at all."
1,always disappointing,"First, there's not enough of the ""squishee"" material to make it half way comfortable.Second, it vibrates...barely....and one on setting only. Definitely not powerful enough to make any kind of dent in the soreness of my feet when I get home from work.Third, it takes batteries but you'll probably stop using it before you barely use the first set.For $14.99...it's still priced too high."
2,"Doesn't Compare To ""Angels of Distress""","""Angels of Distress"" was an album with such powerful emotion and beautiful melody. Their latest album ""Illusion's Play"" however is truly lacking emotion and melody. The songs are mainly monotone hymns of depression. I am rarely bored when listening to bands like My Dying Bride, Katatonia, Evoken and How Like A Winter but this album is just a bore fest. Seriously, it is as if the songs on this album are composed around one note."
2,A Good Lullaby if it Weren't So Funny,"Fans of Foetus, Thurston, and Lydia should be careful with this one. If you're unaquainted with this trio you might find this hodgepodge of bumps, screeches, and half-hearted apocalypse-prosody interesting. But if you love the best work of these artists you'll be alternately snoozing (at the music) and laughing (at Lydia's third-rate Goth-raps).There's nothing especially annoying about this disk (maybe there should have been), it just sounds like all three musicians' usual tricks watered down to a bland consistency. And I'm not sure if the word ""industrial"" means anything any more; it's thrown around so often that it's becoming an umbrella term for anything with no tune, energy, traditional instruments, or content besides poseur morbidity. Get Foetus's ""Thaw,"" Sonic Youth's ""Sister,"" and Lydia's ""Hysterie"", and if you're still curious, pick this one up for archival purposes. Just don't expect it to do much for you."
3,Essential for lovers of Sabacc!,"This is the only Star Wars RPG product to include full rules, and playing cards, for the game of Sabacc (for the uninitiated, it's the game Han Solo played to win the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian). It's a sort of randomzied version of blackjack, with a touch more strategy involved. Great stuff as a stand alone game!The plot to ""Crisis..."" is standard fare. Naturally, it involves threatening player characters with the carbon freezing chamber, but it's too dependent on the survival of its main non-player characters (one of whom is the designer of the Star Destroyer cruiser-class), so it's not very flexible.Sabacc game = 4 starsCrisis On Cloud City story = 2 starsRecommended for the Sabacc game only."
1,Not very entertaining,Watched this DVD hoping to be entertained... but show was boring and unimaginative. Not the best for kids. Any parent wishing to introduce threir children to quaility entertainment or relive their youth should check out Kroft Superstars especially Land of the Lost.
4,Chocolate and Caramel is best,Try a sample bar before buying a bunch. The chocolate caramel bar is the best by far. I am not a fan of the pntbutter chocolate kind. The bars came well packaged and sealed. Appreciate the extra recyclable padding.
4,"YUMMY! Good for You ,,,","I started buying these several years ago and then they vanished. They're delicious and you don't feel like you're eating a health food, which sometimes can be, not so good. This is like a candy bar to me, without all the sugar and calories. These are great even after the expiration date, just keep them refrigerated or in the freezer. Either way, they last for a long time, stay delicious. Great for on the go energy, and not pricey! Enjoy, these are well worth it! Why 4 stars? Out of date, though still good. Also, the Seller does make note of this."
3,Not too great,"For an energy bar: it's adequate. The flavor resembles chocolate, and peanut butter, sort of. But not really. I'd eat it again, if it were around, but I won't be going out of my way looking for this. Not that sweet, kinda chalky taste, like all energy bars."
4,"Really Good Tasting, Diabetic Friendly Bars! Recommended!","The Balance Carb Well Chocolate Peanut Butter bars are fairly good tasting, with 200 Calories and only 2g net carbs. This is important to me since I am a type 2 diabetic and have to watch my carb intake. These bars do not impact my blood sugar levels very much.The taste is more Peanut Butter than Chocolate, but it is still better than a lot of diet products out there. The bar is also fairly filling, so one is nice snack between meals and helps reduce the urge to ""graze"" on worse things.It should be noted that these use Maltitol for sweetness and some people experience ""gastric distress"" when it is taken in large amounts. I would take care if you don't know how it will effect you!Recommended!"
5,Delicioussss,"Delicate flavor, very sweet, it melt in your mouth. I didn't get those horrible stomach side effects as with others low carb bars. Highly recomended. A tip: be aware of order it in summer time, you would get them melted, it happened to me. But in other time of the year you get them perfectly. Enjoy it!"
4,Good Eats,"Even though it is not my favorite flavor of Balance bar, I enjoyed it quite a lot. Next time mocha chip."
1,Received expired product,These were expired with a expiration of June 2012. These unfortunately made me sick. I would not orders these again and threw them out.
4,"For Low Carb Stuff, these are pretty good","I am fat again, so I need to go on a low carb diet and these are the cheapest and best bars out there, in my experience. The size of the bar has gotten smaller, but they are good meal replacements. The goo inside sometimes leaks out, so don't leave them in a warm place. This is more so with this bar than with other chocolate-like bars. I recommend these strongly."
2,Wow do these taste bad,"Im amazed that these have such a high rating on here. They're not inedible, but very nearly. Also, they melt really easily , leaving the bars a huge gross mess."
2,STICKY,"Product is chocolate coated carmel, and was melted package was poor for contents, can buy locally for $.99, thought this may be simpler but product to fragile most bars were melted when box open."
3,"Not bad, but not great either...","I ordered a box of these along with a box of the Caramel 'n Chocolate flavor. The Caramel 'n Chocolate is at least 5 times better tasting. The taste is reasonable enough to tolerate, but if I could redo this order, I would skip this flavor."
3,"Good quality, blah taste.","I have to agree with some of the other reviews. Although I find the texture and freshness to be good, there just isn't much flavor here at all. I tried hard to identify a peanut butter taste and it just isn't there. The chocolate doesn't have a lot of flavor either.For the Balance Carb Well bars, I found the Chocolate Carmel to have better flavor, (though if they ship in high tempt, the carmel likes to ooze out of the bar and stick to the wrapper).The nutritional balance is fine. They aren't awful, but there are better flavors of Balance bars."
2,Carb Well Balance Bars,The bars were a little stale. I used to buy these in Whole Foods. I ordered them because Whole Foods was out. These bars may have been old inventury.
3,Great bars but always melted,"These are the best low carb bars! I used to get them locally from Walmart, but they were discontinued. I have purchased them regularly from Amazon, but during the hot summer, they always arrive unprotected and melted. Replacements are always melted. Maybe they could put some kind of cooling pack in the box or at LEAST label the box as contents may be damaged due to heat. Maybe they will be better as fall comes..."
5,Carb-Well,"It's getting more and more difficult to find these, and since my boyfriend is diabetic, they're a perfect choice for him! Thanks!!"
3,Just ok,"These may taste good to some, but if you are not a fan of coconut... don't buy these bars! I know the flavor is not coconut but that's all I seem to taste with these & I hate the taste of coconut. Yuck!"
2,Its not as good as the picture!!!,Its very light weight and really dud looking. I returned the product back.
4,Mixed Opinion,"I have mixed opionions on this DVD. All the information is there however, Mr. Hawkins has a monotone presentation that is a tonic to insomnia. On the other hand all the vital information is contained within the 2 DVD's. Simply put, he is a wizard guitarist, a teacher he is not. This lesson is best learned in short focused segments."
2,"R. I. Page, Edred Thorsson, Freya Aswynn, the Rune Poems...","There are so many good authors who are credentialed academics in areas of Germanic Studies, many of whom work with the runes, that I can't recommend going with authors who are just writing a book to capture a trend. If I wanted commercialized, watered-down, sanitized, American Eclectic Wicca, I'd look at Ravenwolf. When I want to read and contemplate the Runes, I buy a book from someone who knows what they are talking about. Better yet, I'll pick up the poems of the Elder Edda or the various Rune Poems. I will give them that it is at least far, far better researched than anything put out by Ralph Blum."
5,Gobbolino the Witch's Cat,"This book was read to my class in England, when I was 15 years old. I'm nearly 40 now, and this delightful story has stuck with me for 25 years, until I could read it to my own child. Gobbolino, is a misunderstood soul, a character that all children can asociate with! I now live in Canada, and have spent several years trying to track this book down. Not all stories can drive a mother to these length's, to pass them on to their children. Its a special book!"
4,3D Home Architect Deluxe 3.0,Great Product for the beginner. If you have a home remodeling project this will save you time and effort with you design.
5,"Plays poorly with Windows 7, but wait...","I bought the earliest version of this product, but after Broderbund sold it off, the quality went down hill, and upgrading to anything higher than Version 4 will give you only grief.The trouble with the Broderbund version is that it is only barely compatible with Windows 7: you'll have to import a couple of OS components from the Windows web site.But there is an alternative: Somewhere along the way I learned that the early versions (not the later ones) had been designed by the company that makes Chief Architect. I just talked to them and learned that their DIY level series called Home Designer is compatible with all the plans produced by the early version of 3DHA, and the price for their most basic version is very reasonable."
4,pebozo's in the dark,"I CAN JUST HERE PEBOZO'S COMPLAINTS; ""NOT PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH, DERIVITIVE, TOO POPPY"". WELL PEBOZO LISTEN TO THE FIRST SONG AND YOU'LL HAVE TO PULL YOUR JOCK BACK ON. GREAT EMOTIONAL, INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE WONDERFUL SINGING OF TED LEONARD. THIS CD SHOWS A MATURITY FROM THEIR EARLY ALBUMS AND SIGNALS A GREAT FUTURE. PEBOZO CAN CONTINUE LISTENING TO THE STONED TEMPO PILOTS - AND THOSE GUYS AREN'T CARBON COPIES OF NIRVANA/PEARL JAM???????? AT LEAST THIS SINGER DOESN'T SOUND LIKE EDDIE VEDDER. AT LEAST THIS MUSIC IS MELODIC AND NOT TUNELESS FLANNEL GARBAGE."
4,Chaka,These are remixes I've never heard before. I've heard other remixes of some of these cuts & I prefer the other remixes but it's all good because it's Chaka. It was worth the price. No complaints here.
2,dissapointing!,"most of the remixes on this cd sound really out of date, instead of all this remixes they should have made a compilation with the original full length 12"" mixes, especially for ""This is my night"" wich original mix is far better then the remix (and not available on cd until ....???). Many great remixer names are involved in this project, but in 2007 the original 12 inch versions still sound better!!!."
4,Chaka Khan Life is a Dance Remix,"Chaka Khan has done a remix of many of her tunes that where above outstanding during the disco dance fever of the 1970's. However, I have recently purchased a CD from Amazon.com called ""Chaka Khan, Life is a Dance: The Remix Project"". If rock pop music can be called classical then this particular creation of Chaka Khan and her musician associates can be truly considered classical. One can not merely sit down and keep still while this music is playing, in particular if you are in a dancing mood in the first place, celebrating or just feel good and want to dance. In the same instance, the remix is so skillfully directed and produced, if you just wanted to sit down and really enjoy this music for its composition as music this kind of attitude would be highly applicable as well."
4,Cutler's brigade at Gettysburg,"This book is a good example of how a brigade history must be written. It tells us about one off the brigades that acompished very much in the morning encounter on the first day of the battle of Gettysburg. For every regiment their stories before gettysburg are well detailed and easily to read. (even for a foreigner) Furthermore it tells us stories we did not expect in a book like this. About what after gettysburg, what happened to the wounded, the prisonners, the dead and the survivors. Of course the part about the fiirst and third day's fightings is well detailed. A minus, the pictures are not very clear, it is not very easy to see what they tlet you see and actually the don't tell us anything. A good book, must be in every gettysburg librarie."
5,A Must Read for Any Liverpool Fan,"This is a definitive biography of the life of the greatest manager to ever manage. It is a must read for any Liverpool fan. It is inpirational how he rose from his humble beginnings to be the most revered manager in English football. Even if you don't like Liverpool, it is still a great read about a great man (even for you Mancs out there)."
3,OK music,"This cd is ok, I only give it a 3 star rating,because I have heard better, but for the price it's ok.The original swing songs are noticeably better than these, but that may go for all original music.There are better cd's out there with this music."
4,thats my Mama,Brings back wonderful memories. DVD tab/holder broken but DVD is excellant. Thanks!Clifton Davis' role remind me of a good friend
3,OK,I liked season 1 a lot. I bought season 2 and the theme song changed and some characters had changed and mama was not as mean to the postman who now works partime as a barber which he is no good at. I like the the first season a whole lot better. But hey I still would reccomend you buy it. IT's still ok just not as good as the first.
5,What it takes to write the greatest poem of the 20th century,"Simply put, THE WASTE LAND is one of the strangest, most complicated, and interesting poems ever written. Try reading an unannotated version of the poem and you will see why even TS Eliot scholars need a little help with some of the images and literary references Eliot uses. This NORTON CRITICAL EDITION of THE WASTE LAND is an essential book for any Eliot fan, new or old. It provides you with practically every single piece of literature, history, and music that inspired Eliot to write his manifesto of the Lost Generation. If you have any questions concerning THE WASTE LAND, this is the book you need...this is the book you want. Buy it and realize how well-read you are not."
4,"Great poem, comprehensive edition",The Waste Land is undoubtedly the most contentious and possibly the greatest poem of the 20th century. The reactions to and interpretations of the poem are as diverse as the multiple voices Eliot conjurs throughout the work. This edition is useful because it presents the variety of critical responses to the poem; historical and contemporary. The extensive bibliography points the reader to other important critical material. The edition is ultimately successful because of these virtues. Mr. North's emphasis on source materials drawn directly fr
1,Ugh,"Williams was right. Eliot has taken poetry twenty years into the past with this poem. While others are experimenting with their poetics, Eliot falls back on an Old World school of writing that would be better obsolete. What's worse is his poems just get worse from here on out (less help from Pound on the editing, maybe?). He should have kept his day job his only job."
1,Not good for VISTA,"We ordered this product because Amazon technical information indicated that was compatable with Windors Vista, but the product intructions on the package do not mention VISTA."
4,Works with Vista,Bought this to connect my telescope drive cable to my laptop. Meade wanted well over 40 for basically the same cable! All the information you may need is in the reviews. Amazon rocks!
4,Worked for my Buell XB9SL,Plugged right into the ECU and I was able to use my programs to map it out how I wanted it using this sweet adapter.
3,Decent,"My husband and I bought this book as a starting point to have something to talk about on date night. It's been nice, but I wish the exercises were a bit longer and a bit more in-depth. I like the book, but probably would choose something else next time."
1,Not what I was expecting,"Don't buy this book as a gift, unless you want to tell the recipients their marriage is on the rocks.I got this book as a present for my sister-in-law and her husband, thinking it would be a lighthearted list of FUN ideas for things to do in their new free time. Wrong-o.This book might be excellent for couples who are really, really fixated with their relationship, but for couples who just want to enjoy each other's company ... keep looking!"
1,Dumbest show ever,"I have seen a lot of musicals, some I adored others I didn't care that much about, but still enjoyed seeing them. But Beautiful Game is the one show I regret spending money on - all the more so as I left after the first act! It was all just so dumb, simply unbearable! To be quite honest, I'd have left even earlier, only I was sat in the middle of a row!I'm sorry, I couldn't see anything special, just a group of extremely stupid boys - none of them convincing in whatever they pretended to be or to do!Shame for the money and time wasted!"
3,Andrew's best...Elton's WORST,I like the score. It's for sure one of the better Webber musicals. I feel like the only reason that people are reveering him is because he actually wrote a serious musical. I am suprised at the high caliber of singing on the recording (london recordings are never as good)...
1,Painful to watch,"I don't write a lot of movie reviews because I believe that all movies have some redeeming value, but this movie is truly painful to watch, and I watched the entire movie. The acting is the most painful. The timing is poor, the Foley work is non-existent (i.e. sound effects are poor at best). Unless you're studying film and looking for an example of a really bad movie, don't waste your time or money. Avoid this movie at all costs. BTW: George Kennedy does a small cameo appearance (the only convincing acting in the movie). Run don't walk away from this one."
2,Numbing repetition,"To understand even a ""simple"" bacteria, it is not enough to understand how biochemical pathways occur in a test tube, what proteins are coded for by each gene, and how these proteins can self assemble in vitro. Inheritance is comprised of not just DNA, but biochemical gradients, and cell structure. I learned some interesting and important things in the half of this book that I read. But at too much cost. Sure I had to look up a number of words, but with my ""Dictionary of Modern Biology"" by Norma Rudin, that was fun. What was not fun was the numbing repetition of the same thoughts, at length. Also, if you do not have a decent background in cellular biology, do not even think of reading this book: start with a book that Harold actually recommends, ""Life Itself: Exploring the Realm of the Living Cell"" by Boyce Rensberger."
2,Flap!,I am gadget freak and I bought this out of curiosity and flexibility hoping I can use this with ease but I find it a tough cookie to use. I am not really satisfied with this bracket at all. I can't find any use for this at the moment.
4,Faxed Head new Pop Sensations,"Faxed Head are four wonderful men from Coalinga California who rose from the depths of suicide pacts and glue addiction to make a wonderful pop song ""The Mechanic"" for this awesome compilation! I highly suggest you purchace their full length through Amarillo Records. Show pride in Coalinga"
5,Impressed by your book delivery in time!,"According to your promise, the book I ordered arrived in time and according to your description in an excellent state. Thank you very much for your trustworthy service!Maria"
5,This album has nothing to do with Sinatra!,"What this album is, is a faithful recreation of the Jimmy Smith/Stanley Turrentine Blue Note albums recorded in the late 50's like Midnight Special (there's a reference to Jumpin The Blues by the guitarist), Plays Fats Waller, Crazy Baby, Back at the Chicken Shack. It's that 'down home' laid back bluesy style that makes you want to groove on down. Don't get me wrong I've grown to love this album although at first I thought it was rather bland.However Joey always delivers the way he only can so just buy it!"
4,Fun alone or with a friend,The game is alot of fun; you can play an entire 162 game season with real teams and players or a quick game of only a few innings. It's fun playing againt the computer and even better against someone else. If you like baseball games it's a good game.
3,good but not great,"this game is not to bad. it is entertaining on one player, but the reason why a person buys a sports game is to rip your friends up when you score a touchdown or jack one out. this game is seriously lacking in the two player realm. honestly i ask myself if this game was even tested by people that really play video games at all. the only quality that this game shows is the graphics and the speed of players in relation to the field. in these terms this game is definitly better that all star baseball with jeter on the cover. but all star baseball has better two player game play."
2,not the best of triple plays,This game is not like the rest of triple plays. The ball cusor and the base running is horrible. It becomes easier for you to hit the ball while playing head to head. The pitcher loses all power of out smarting and out playing your partner. The base running give you the player about 25%of control of your base runners. The tend to steal and advance to the next base without any command giving the defense the free will to threw you out with ease. If the next triple play can recover from this disapointment maybe i might consider on getting the next. But this game is not on the level expected on a ea sports level. So dont buy this game.
2,"Great graphics, marginal gameplay, batting cursor must go!","... ... ...I bought TP and was very impressed by the graphics, which blows away its competition, but the gameplay needs work. What EA really needs is to make the batting cursor/visible strike zone OPTIONAL. For a beginner, this would come in handy, but for hardcore baseball fans and gamers, the batting cursor/visible strike zone must go. It's too easy to hit the ball! That's no fun. As a result, boredom is inevitable and replay value is low. So, I returned TP and bought High Heat, which is the only baseball game out on the market that DOES NOT have the batting cursor/visible strike zone, but the graphics look like PS1. Gameplay is fair, but I prefer TP's. What would be great is if all the best features of all the PS2 baseball games were combined into one game. That'd be ideal. EA, I hope you're reading this :) Go Mariners!"
3,You might like the game if...,"If you like homeruns and want a game with good graphics and really corny gameplay, get Triple Play. If you want a realistic baseball game, get All Star Baseball or High Heat Baseball. Triple Play has better graphics, but there's too many homeruns and it makes the game boring. When you hit the ball, it sounds like a rocket taking off. But if you just like homeruns and you don't care if the game feels real, get Triple Play. It all depends on what you want...."
3,why did I buy this game?,"Pro: great graphics and play by play comments (and that's it)Here come the cons.It's much easier to get a hit than a walk.....I can live w/ that. Using Padres to play season mode of all star level (hardest level), I've gone 23 wins and 0 loses.....I can live w/ that. CPU teams call off their starting pitchers very early in games (like 5 behind in the 3rd inning, or 3 behind in the 5th inning)......I can live w/ that. A 1-0 game result in colorado....I can live w/ that.I can't live w/ HUGE BUGS of the game. For several times, my pitcher finished an inning by just getting 2 outs. For several times, I had 3 RBI by hitting a homerun and it only showed 2 runs on the scoreboard. What r those bugs? Isn't EA the most profitable 3rd party game developer company? I'm so disappointed. I don't know how good r the other 2 ps2 baseball games, but PLEASE...PLEASE....don't even think about getting this game."
2,The worst game play ever including atari 2600,"I have never been a fan of this series but not because I have some bias towards EA. (I like Madden and other cool EA games).Wanting a good baseball game for my overrated PS2 system, I gave this game a shot. First of all, the one good thing: the graphics. I think it has the best graphics out of the three PS2 baseball games.Now the bad: If you want a 1-P game, this game may suit your need if you just want to smash home-runs after another. But for a 2-P experience, DON'T EVER BUY THIS THING. The batter-pitcher interface has a major flaw which essentially tips the hitter of the pitch location. The end result: games in the 20 runs are not uncommon. This is not baseball."
2,A major disappointment,"After playing the outstanding Madden 2001 and the fast paced NHL2001 and NBA 2001, Triple Play Baseball for the ps2 is a major disappointment. First, the fielding in the game is awkward and slow. It was a major mistake of EA Sprots to drop the automatic fielding option in the game from previous years. Second, there are no historical players, like in Triple Play 2001. I always thought it was fun to be able to get Babe Ruth off the free agent market. My advice: stick to last year's version. The improved grphics don't make the game more fun."
1,Triple Play Baseball,"I was a huge fan of the prior versions of this game on the playstation console. However, when i brought this game i was immediately disappointed. several things were not in this game that were in the prior playstation versions. THERE IS NO AUTOMATIC FIELDING ANYMORE. it was such a pain to have to control your fielders all the time. my hands were tired by the fifth inning. without automatic fielding , i doubt anybody would want to play a 162 game season since your hands would cramp up and the game would be so time consuming. you could not edit the time of the game ( day, dusk or night)and whether you want wind or not. Prior triple play versions gave you this option. the graphics were poor. i was playing with the mets and mike piazza ( a big guy) looked like he was the same size as rey ordonez (170 lb shortstop). i expected the triple play game to get better with the new system, but it got ten times worse."
1,Maybe for young kids,"If you're a baseball fan, or just a serious gamer, avoid this game. Its all eye-candy and no gameplay. You'll be bored in less than a day.The score at the end of my first game looked more appropriate for a basketball game!Save your money."
3,"Ok,but could have been better.","I a little disappointed with this years game. Mainly because of the fielding. There's no auto fielding, what's the deal with that. And the fielders are to slow not to have this availible to you. If it wasn't for that little problem. I would give this game aleast another star."
4,Pretty good,"This game is pretty good. It has decent graphics and pretty good announcing, it is very similar to the other Triple Play games. Home runs are very easy to hit and striking out the computer is very easy as well. There are also a couple of flaws, for example, if you throw a knuckleball about one inch high of the strike zone, it will be called a strike, and it is physically impossible to hit-- otherwise, a fun, good game"
2,Triple play is a Triple Waste,"I bought this game looking for a good baseball game to play. First off I popped it in and and the graphics were pretty good. The interface with the seasons and trading players needs work, it just lets you get the players you want, but it does say ""Thats not a fair trade.""????? Okay then I got into the game. The graphics were good. Thats where my praise ends. The Announcing is terrible, I can't stand it. The AI stinks to high heaven (Shortstops going way into the outfield to get the ball.)The fielding stinks, I couldn't catch anything sometimes. I must have got a defective copy because on just pro level, I couldn't win a game to save my bum bum. The batting system has to go. I really hate this game, and I'm not usually to picky. Worst 50 bucks I spent."
1,Not Realistic,"Every other hit seems to be a home run. You put the batting icon where the ball is going to be and the result is a home run. Slow motion for a foul ball. The fielders are hard to move. I can't seem to get them in position to catch a ball. When a fielder does catch a ball, they are not quick to get it to the appropriate fielder...firt baseman, cut off man, etc. When pitching... if the batter takes practice swings...the pitcher cannot start his windup. Overall, I am not pleased with this game... Scores tend to total 50 runs or more."
1,WOW! This game his horrible.,"I would have to consider this game one of the worst baseball games all time. I mean you would think that on Playstation 2 EA would at least include night games, but not on this one. Also the players look like cartoons and the gameplay sucks. If you hit a Home Run then there is a delay in the game shortly after. Also the players in the dugout are a joke. Also the graphhis pretty much looked like playstation graphics really fuzzy. They are flat figures. Something I found funny was that the baseball actually looks like a beach ball. REALLY BIG. Overall I would consider waiting for All Star Baseball 2002 because it will be a lot better. I finished one game then I took it to the Pawn Shop because it sucked. The main question I got is did EA ship only the Playstation Version of this GAME?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!,"First, let me say, I believe that Triple Play baseball is the GREATEST baseball game ever made!!!! Triple Play 2000, no doubt, the best of the series. However, Triple Play for the Playstation2 is the WORST baseball game ever MADE. The players look like midgets, the game-play is horrible, and the over-all charteristics of the game are sadly, sadly, flawed. Unless you can buy this game for $0.99 cents you will be wasting your money."
2,So many glitches and NO FRANCHISE!!!,"Well, let my start by saying this game should not be bought by anyone at any price. The game play is completely unrealistic. For some reason, it's easier to get a hit off of Pedro or the Rocket than off of some loser like Pettitte. You can NEVER walk, making it less fun, and there is no way to bunt for a base hit. You can't move in the batter's box without starting the runners sometimes thanks to the direction you move, and occasionally the game freezes up. The funniest thing I found, is that Matt Perisho throws a 110 mph sinker. It's completely ludicrace. The guy can't even throw 90. There is no franchise mode! This has to be my biggest gripe. Why couldn't they add some farm systems and a franchise mode? How hard would that be? Overall, once you play a couple warmups, you can win every time, especially against the best pitchers in the game. Have fun blowing 30 bucks if you want to.Go Tigers! I still have faith in you!"
2,Loafing.,"When you swing the bat, your player disappears. The graphics are loafin'. This game seems rushed and underdeveloped, and the gameplay is not compelling. Especially in light of the excellence you expect from EA based on Madden. I would avoid this game as you will ultimately be disappointed; wait for the next installment. Wiffle ball is way more fun."
4,Best baseball game to date,"Triple play just keeps getting better! Could take a few pointers from All Star Baseball 2003, whose players look so much like the real ones. Would be nice if you had old school uniforms,players,and stadiums, but overall the best one yet. It's a lot easier to hit, which is a lot more than I can say for ASB2003, and High Heat. If I want to play a game where it's hardto hit I'll go join a real league! My only complaint really, is that it's hard to stretch singles into extra base hits, and it's too easy to steal."
4,What do you really want?,"This is a good, fun game. If you are looking for a realistic game this probably isnt for you, but the graphics are incredible, and its just fun to play. This isn't the type of game that you simulate a whole season, and the roster options aren't very deep, but the actual playing of the game is very fun, if not very realistic."
3,Fun for an initial PS2 outing,"Much better than the first 128-bit system baseball game, Sega's World Series 2K1 for Dreamcast, which doesn't even allow you to field the ball. Still, baseball purists may be offended at the arcade style pitching/hitting interface which results in high-scoring games. On the other hand, do you really want realism? Do you want no hitters, final scores of 1-0, and batters who strike out, ground out, or pop out 7 out of 10 times? I didn't think so! Although there definitely is room for improvement, Triple Play looks nice and has no serious flaws that ruin gameplay. Just don't expect a simulation-style contest."
4,Despite What others say Triple Play has hit another Home Run,"I must say I disagree with others on this game. The graphics are excellent. The best I have seen on PS2 so far. But, as a sports junkie, I alwats find the best sports game are those with a general manager mode. EA has been the cornerstone of in-depth Season modes for sports games. TP is no different. Trades, Drafts, Free Agency. Its all here. The gameplay is a little lacking in the fact there is no automatic fielding. Getting the hang of playing of the field is very hard. Had there been a automatic fielding made I would have given TP 5 stars. A excellent start to the PS2 platform for Triple Play."
4,"Superbly written, insightful story","A tough tale but held me from beginning to end. Story of a working class guy and family, he is searching but is ill- starred and we know it. He squirms but in the end cannot escape his fate. Banks is Raymond carverish, very plugged in to the struggle for self- expression. Superior narrator."
3,Unrelieved grimness,"I usually like Russell Banks, but this novel gave me nightmares. The characters seem to have nothing likeable to balance the 'continental drift'. I found the references to voudoun interesting, but not enough to make me want to keep reading. After about a quarter of the way through, I gave up."
5,If only Oprah would endorse this -,"I became a huge fan of Russell Banks several years ago after hearing a discussion of ""Continental Drift"" on NPR. After reading all of his novels, this stands out as by far one of his finest works - far better than even the more-widely known ""Sweet Hereafter"". Now, with movies such as ""Crash"" and the upcoming film version of T.C. Boyle's ""Tortilla Curtain"", it's high time this astonishing and enduring story of culture clash reached the audience it deserves. Oprah, are you listening? Clint Eastwood, have you looked into the movie rights? Just read it."
1,Couldn't take it.,"This book kicked my skepticism into high gear right away with its pretentious ""invocation,"" and I never recovered. The writing is insufferably grand and serious in comparison to the mundane material, the characters are unrelatable caricatures, and the story (or as much as I could read of it) is depressing, predictable, and, in places, gratuitously pornographic. Back in the 80s folks thought stuff like this was ""gritty"" and ""hard-edged."" Me? I just find it intolerable.If you can't tell, I didn't like it. I understand other people do though, so there you go."
5,The Great American Novel,"This book is underrated and underappreciated. All who want to find, read (or write) The Great American Novel should start and stop here. This is it. And, no surprise, it's about racism and class."
1,"Long winded, not banks best","Russel Banks other novels, although wordy at times, at least carry a story that ends somewhere. This novel, following the pathetic Bob Dubois, never picks up steam and I always had difficulty feeling any lack of empathy for the main characters of the story- in the end, i was simply glad it was over-"
1,A depressing tale about a group of losers with no redeeming value,"Russell Banks is the master of the depressing story about losers. There is not a single character in this book worth knowing about. There is not a single event worth hearing about. And the writing is terrible -- pretentious, ""full of sound and fury and signifying nothing"".A book to be avoided at all costs, unless one is in misery or despair and looking for company."
4,This book will open your eyes!!!,"I strongly recommend this book. It is about time that someone wrote a book about the virtues of the Chinese people living in the western U.S. during the 19th century. Most similar books concentrate on the discrimination and other injustices done to the Chinese workers who worked on the railroads, for example.""A Chinaman's Chance,"" however, focuses on the positive Chinese experiences. Did you know that the Chinese had superior eating habits and work ethics? Hidong Sidong was the first Chinese man to lead an asian hiking expedition in the 19th century. Did you know that? Do you know who invented Rocky Mountain oyster stew?I strongly recommend this book."
2,"Good, but more of the same","If you like the type of music that radio is currently force feeding its public, then this CD would be acceptable. They have some good hooks, but no real substance. I'm not even sure if they are still around. For what they lack in musical creativity they match with business aptitude. Any band that lacks aggressive promotion and basic desire to achieve more, more often than not, reflects that same hum-drum attitude in their final product. In short, this disc does not ..., nor does it stick."
1,Fairly useless if you're looking for Florida specific info,"This book is about 75% fluff that has nothing to do with Florida at all. Information like ""can you afford to move"" and budgetting and getting ready to move can be found elsewhere. The actual Florida specific information (about 80 pages) is mostly phone numbers, general information that could be obtained elsewhere easily (like residential information), useless (to a younger person) will and estate planning information, and a few helpful pages of comments from people who moved to Florida. The rest of the book could just as well have been cut from ""Destination Guam"" or ""Destination Texas"" or any other book about moving. I get the feeling that the book was written specifically for older people moving from the New York area to Florida, and for myself, a 35 year old potential mover from the Midwest, the book is almost entirely useless. I'm still looking for a good book on relocation to Florida issues."
3,Good read - covers an important topic,"This book was very interesting. Its stories kept my attention and it was written in a smooth, easy to read style. I have heard about similar stories like this from fellow practitioners. The documentation and sources backed up the reality of what was happening. I gave it only three stars as the book was too long and should have been written more like a documentary."
1,A disappointment.,"The roaster is a nice size and weight. Unfortunately, after a few uses, the teflon started coming off."
1,Can't be used AT ALL on the stovetop!,"After only 8 months, the Teflon started to bubble off the pan and after contacting KitchenAid (who, to their credit, responded very quickly) I was told that the pan CANNOT be used on top of the stove, even just for making gravy. What kind of a roaster is THAT, I ask you??? They will replace the roaster but now I think of it as merely a lasagna pan with a rack. Or a roaster that can be used only if you scrape all the drippings out and into another pan before you make gravy.The bottom line is, don't buy this roaster even though it looks great and works fine for a while."
1,Not worth ordering,"I've had two of these. Despite a great design, the quality is unfortunately seriously flawed.The coating on the first started to come off after a month of use, despite using appropriate utensils and only hand-washing. I replaced it, and the second was even worse. Since I don't really want Teflon in my food (or bloodstream), that was it. I'm back to All-Clad stainless steel and Calphalon hard-anodized roasters."
1,beautiful design horrible technology,The only item in my life I took back to SAMS where I bought it and showed them the falking. they; took it back. This pan is the best designed roaster I have ever had but immediately began to flake and rust on the shell.
1,Doesn't meet expectations,"After just 15 - 20 uses (coupled with hand washing and only plastic utensils), the non-stick coating began to bubble and flake off exposing bare metal. Once the bubbles appeared, the process accelerated until 50% of the pan interior bottom was exposed bare metal. Very annoying, and I would recommend that this product be avoided. Looks great new, until you use it."
1,teflon doesn't last,I received it as a Christmas gift and was very careful hand washing it and using the correct tools due to the Teflon coating. Within a month the coasting started coming off; I blamed myself but could not figure out why. I happened to go to this page of reviews on Amazon looking for a replacement pan and discovered I am not alone with this problem. Do not waste your money on this product. I think that KitchenAid should pull the item; it only damages the company's reputation.
1,not happy with the kitchenaid product,I had been pleased with Kitchaid products in the past but this is not one of them. I purchased this to use for holidays. I never used anything abbrasive yet the coating peeled after about 3 uses. I am going to get a stainless one next time.
1,Dont; buy it,"As others have indicated, after a few uses the Teflon bubbles off. Then the pan rusts. I've used it maybe three times and it's headed for the trash."
2,Perfect for small roasting but cheap,"I purchased this after our wedding in 2006. My first use was thanksgiving or 2007. After 1 use the coating was coming off. Now, I see this is typical but like most said you can't use this to make gravy on the stove top. I never used it to do that and it's still feeling. If you continue to use it it will rust and you'll have Teflon chunks in your gravy.Very disappointing Kitchen-Aid- I came to expect MORE from your stuff.One major pro is that when I was living in Germany the ovens were VERY small and this fit perfectly. Even held up to 22 lbs of turkey.Too bad it wasn't made a little better, might have gotten 5 stars."
1,lining peeled off - disappointed!,I thought this was a good quality KitchenAid product but it peeled badly after cooking a beef tenderloin at high temp. We threw it out.
1,All flash no dash,"I myself have bought this Roaster and yes it worked for awhilebut it started to bubble and peel. KitchenAid to their credithave replaced both the original and the second they sent me.KitchenAid says they are aware of the problem but have notdone anything to fix the problem. I suggest people spend abit more money on Berndes,Le Creuset or Emile Henry. Theymay be more expensive but I don't have any problems withthese products."
1,Tephlon peels off with oven use,Tephlon peels off with oven use only. Placement of handles is very poor making it difficult to open when hot. Would not buy!!
5,Very Good,"I thought it a bit pricy, but after using it, its well worth the money. Very well made and sturdy. Cleans up in a snap. No, I dont use it on the stove-top, nor do I use it in a 500 degree oven for hours. Should last forever!"
2,"Well-made, but shouldn't have gotten a nonstick roasting pan","This pan, like my previous experience with KitchenAid products, is sturdy, well-made, and a good design (mechanically speaking) for the task. My only complaint is that it's nonstick - I knew this going in, but am now realizing that nonstick is less than ideal for a pan that routinely gets stuff baked onto it, which requires scrubbing. We've already started to lose the nonstick coating. My next roasting pan will be stainless, not nonstick."
3,Not Like the Others,"I bought these as a way to try flats. Unfortunately, the are not like other flats. They were not as nice as birdseye or flannel flat diapers. The are a bit rough and VERY thin. The muslin does shrink up quite a bit after prepping. The weave is VERY loose wich means decreased absorbancy, but increased breathability. I mainly use them now folded up as inserts or doublers, and they work GREAT for that. They would also work great for newborns. And you can't beat the price!"
4,Fun dragon times!,The series entertains and delights! If you want an easy read with some thought provoking elements; this is for you!
5,Have you ever wondered...,Dickson has developed a series of books that allows the reader of today to say what if...? This unique viewpoint allows for the writer to put a 21st century spin on a classic fantasy novel. Characters are real in a fatastic world. This particular book puts Jim the Dragon Knight in the world of King Arthur.An enjoyable read.
3,Dickson's creative powers a-draggin'.,"Gordon Dickson's latest Dragon Knight novel, is sad to say, the weakest in the series. In his previous outings Dickson had always managed to maintain a delicate balance between Dickson's always-delightful humorous and satirical elements and the more serious action-adventure episodes. In the Dragon of Lyonesse, however, the latter elements predominate to such a degree that renders the final result almost uniformly depressing and even worse, dull. Only recommended to Dragon-Knight fans who want a complete set of the series."
5,Worth it,Does what it said it would do: Plug and play. I have an SNES rom simulator on my PC and this controller works very well. It's one of the best PC controllers out there and I recommend it.
4,MAC users get HELP!,"It works fine. I just wish that Logitech was even slightly more helpful, but in spite of them and after a some searching I found the shareware ""USB Overdrive"" that allows me to program every button for almost every game. ( I don't work for this developer!)"
5,Both a solid and economic buy!,"This controller is awesome! It solved all my problems with trying to fumble around on emulator games using my keypad. For $10, the price is right. If you are looking to play games on gametap or other emulator software, this is the perfect controller."
5,Well Played,"I bought this for emulators as I can assume almost everyone else did, and i was not let down. Extraordinarly easy to setup quite litteraly you will plug and play. Nice color, sharp controls, for 9.99 how can you go wrong?"
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought one of these roughly one year ago, and I had used it every now and then, but not every day. The buttons began to stick within that year period, making it very difficult to use -- but since it was relatively inexpensive, and since it worked well before the buttons began to stick, I bought another one (from a different seller).However, within 3 days, the directional keys on the new gamepad broke! So, I'd recommend that you instead shell out a few more dollars for a reliable gamepad."
3,You get what you pay for! ( only true for cheap products though),Its been working OK so far. The directional (analog) key sometimes malfunctions though (5% of the time). You push say left and the player moves forward instead. I'll be getting another one soon with a digital key and with vibration capabilities too
3,it is good enough,"Good enough to save my macbook pro keyboard from being smashed, the ergonomics of the control is what i dont like, after a while it will make your hands tired by holding the control, other than that, it works fine, for the price it is ok."
4,Works well,"I ended up buying two of these, they work pretty good for the price. Also, this controller fits somewhat comfortably in my hands."
2,Disappointed,"The device itself is pretty good. It seems robust and comfortable. However, the game support is lousy. I purchased it with an EA Sports bundle that it recommended for by Amazon and it really only works with one game in the bundle. Trying to find other games that support it without jumping through hoops is difficult. It's what I get for going cheap."
4,quick set up! easy to use + works great.,"I bought this because of the pc game, Ice Age 2. We had a horrible time trying to play it using the keyboard. I really hate games like that anyway, but this one was especially bad. I plugged the controller in as soon as I got it and we played with it that same afternoon when my son got home from school. It worked perfectly. My only drawback, and I don't know if this has to do with the controller or the game, is that the button numbers on the game don't match up with the button numbers on the controller. That's easy to get past, but it is the only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5. If you don't mind figuring out which numbers are which the first time you play, GET IT!"
1,It does not work with iMac (Tiger),"I have an iMac 10.4.11 (Tiger), I bought this item for my son. We installed this gamepad controller and it didn't work in any of the games that we have (Kickin'soccer, starwars (lego), call of duty). I got upset with it. Do not spend your time and money on it."
4,Logiteck plug and play gamepad,The Logiteck precision plug and play gamepad works very good and the price was right.
5,Brings me back to my youth,"I bought this product so that i could get the old feel back when playing all the old NES and SNES roms i recently downloaded. Works great, no problems, and can't beat the price."
2,Not as promised,"We have not been able to get this to work with our computer. It should be a match and our computer doesn't seem to want to play this accessory.?? Sounded easy and was priced right, but now not so good?!"
1,Didn't work for me.......,"This was probably my own fault, but this controller just wouldn't work. I plugged it into my laptop, and tried playing NHL07 with it. The buttons worked, but it was stuck going in the upwards direction. So, on the main menu of the game I couldn't select anything because it never stopped. I even took it apart to see if myaybe it was just jammed. Even after I took the casing and buttons off it still went in the upwards direction. Needless to say I'm not very happy, but I guess I should have looked into this before buying it."
2,Good for basic game,"Pro: good price, satisfy basic gamerCon: no joystickI have this gamepad for a while. It is ok for most of the basic (old) game, but then I now feel like to have a joystick, especially when playing for a few hours."
2,"looks sturdy, but it's not!","It seems like a standard playstation controller, other than the analogs right? WRONG! The dpad is real mushy and not too precise. The buttons are quite good though. If you are purchasing this for fighting games, you are making a huge mistake. The dpad broke after less than 2 weeks! If you got a PSX or PS2 controller, get a PS to PC converter, it's much better and cheaper."
5,Get what u paid for,"For under $10 and free shipping you have had more than what you paid. For a budget-concern gamer, this is a must buy. I have had this thing over a month and I like it. It dosn't have any fancy stuff, but as a controller, it has advantage over your keyboard and also prevent several special keys of your keyboard being damaged. That is all what you would expect from an Entry level controller."
4,Exactly what it claims to be,"I plugged this puppy in to a USB port and started playing. It's cheap, it gets the job done.I'm sure there's lots of controllers with a lot more options; I just wanted a gamepad that worked without spending a lot of dough. I got exactly that, and I'm quite pleased."
2,Inexpensive but cheap.,"First the controller came in molded plastic packaging that was a pain to open. The cheap plastic controller got nicked in a few places as I struggled to open the packaging.When I opened it, the controller installed painlessly on my Vista machine, which was a relief as Vista seems to enjoy fighting peripherals now and then.There was one button that acts flaky (button 6) but otherwise all the buttons work and it does the job. I use it to play Madden 2008 and it does the job.Overall, it's ten dollars and if you are on a tight budget, it's a good controller for the price. If you can afford better, I would recommend getting better, but this is worth the mere ten bucks you pay for it."
5,Works great - use for SNES9x on G3 clamshell,Super Nintendo emulator games are SOOO much easier to play with this controller than with the tiny keys on my ancient little mac laptop. Set up was simple. Buttons work great. Turned my 5 year old laptop into a favorite gaming machine. Thanks!
5,a great product,"Just read some of the other reviews and you'll get an idea of how good this is. At ten dollars, especially considering how much entertainment I can get out of it, this controller is gold. If I were to pick a couple things negative to say about it, I would say that it's kind of light, and that the shape is a bit different. But both of these are not really necessarily negative, and I actually like the shape and weight of it personally. If for whatever reason you want something a bit heavier and don't think you'd like the extra curved shape, maybe you should rethink your purchase. Otherwise, I'd go for this one."
2,review of logitech gamepad,I would advised persons not to buy this gamepad. this is the third one I have bought and i hope it last longer than the other two logitech gamepad. It would work for like three weeks and then start to malfunction until it stop work.
5,An excellent gamepad for the money...,"I admit when I first picked up the gamepad I really believed that it was cheaply made and that it wouldn't last if it really worked at all. Boy, am I surprised! Not only was the controller inexpensive but it is definitely a quality accessory.I'm using the controller to play Fifa 06 and the control is tight and responsive and it is really adding to my gameplay experience. If vibration and analog sticks aren't wanted or required by your PC gaming, you cannot do better than this pad. Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointed,"As I recall, the ad indicated that this controller would work with a PC but try as I might I cannot get the two to communicate.I can test all of the buttons and they work but I cannot get PC to assign buttons.I suppose it could have been ""customer error"" but it still doesnt work.So, I'm not happy but it could be my fault......"
3,Not enough programmable buttons for most games,I got it to work on my MacBook Pro but there weren't enough programmable buttons for the Lego games my nephew plays. The game won't play unless all actions are assigned to a button so this is useless. Disappointing because the only action that couldn't be assigned was Pause Game. Really? Sending it back and trying another one with more buttons.
3,Decent for the price,"Bought this thing long time ago when it was cheap. I was a heavy user as a gamer, therefore the thing was a good gamepad for a short term purpose. However, about a year after I started using it I have problem with my D-pad (specifically when I tried to press the Up direction). So I was forced to buy another gamepad."
4,A controller for the PC,"No compaints, except the lateral control on some games leaves much to desire. Maybe I expected too much, but that's what I found wanting."
2,"One year, and done","We used it with our computer with one game only, so it has not seen much use. We have owned it for just under a year and it just stopped working. Nothing appears to be broken, but no matter what we have tried, the buttons do not do anything.Bummer."
2,Logitech USB Plug-in Gaming Controller,"I got this controller so I could properly play games on my ePSXe Emulator. After trying it out, I noticed the direction pad (left side) did not work as I would like it to. Too often when I try to move in a single direction, I hit another directional button, which can be frustrating. This seems to be because the directional pad, instead of having the 4 directions separate, has them linked together in that circular piece that moves as you press any of the directions. This makes it easier to move in diagonal directions, but more difficult for simple movements in only one direction. Other than that, I have no problems with the controller. I think if I compare it to a Playstation 1, 2, or 3 controller, those controllers would be better than this Logitech one because they don't have the problem with the directional pad."
2,They Break after about a year,"After about a year of using it, the d-pad starts to stick and break. This renders the controller useless. If you need something cheap for emulator play, then get this; but if you want to use it for fighting games, get something sturdier."
2,Not what we expected.,"This item wasn't as great as we thought it would be. It doesn't work with current role playing games. The description said it would, but it doesn't. My husband has yet to see a game he currently owns that would work with it. He has new games such as Fable, Oblivion, and others..and this gamepad isn't helpful at all. He is still making due with the keyboard til he gets a pad that works. We might be returning this and getting something else."
5,Nice product...,This is a nice game pad. 5 starts for the price...!!! I use it to play Street Fighter 4 and it's great... I have had no problems... really easy to set up too. Recommended A+
4,"Outstanding Tribute to Frank Sinatra and his producer, Voyle Gilmore","John Gilmore grew up around music and the greats who made it. His father was renowned Capitol Records producer Voyle Gilmore (Frank Sinatra, The Kingston Trio, Judy Garland, Les Paul, and even one live Beatles album). This album, recorded 20 years after his father's 1979 death, is a tribute to both his father and Sinatra. 11 of the 13 tracks are covers of songs his father produced with Sinatra, and the other two are original compositions. John is not a Sinatra imitator as much as a celebrator of his great body of work. He did all the arranging and played piano on the album. Standout tracks include ""I've Got You Under My Skin,"" ""In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,"" and ""One For My Baby."" But it's all good. Highly recommended."
2,not durable enough,"I love making soap massage bars, so this was well used for the holiday gifts. I previously had one that I was too rough with, and I broke it. So I ordered another & I was extremely gentle with it in comparison. My first one lasted a heck of a lot longer then this even though I beat it up, this mold's plastic didn't hold up well and cracked within the first 5 times I used it. Wouldn't get it again, even though I love the actual mold shapes. Plus cybertrayd shipped 5 business days after my order, which doesn't adhere to Amazon policy. I wouldn't order from them again either. I've decided to make my own silicone flexible molds instead of bothering with the plastic ones."
1,This whisk is so..... BAD!!,"This is totally different quality from what I know about Calphalon. It looks so nice when I received it, and feels lightweight in hand. But, after twice of use, the whish fell apart. I can't put them back on securely! I will definite send it back if not for it has past 30 days of return period. Unless you are using this whisk to stir the soup, or otherwise, please don't waste your money on this one!!! Sincerely, Frustrated cook!"
3,I understand the bad reviews,"There is a faberware one that is actually nicer at the local WM for half the price. The whipping piece tends to go flat instead of staying rounded, but at least it's usable in non-stick cookware.BTW, mine fell apart on its first use and it was frustrating to put it back together. I'm thinking of mailing it to the manufacturer with a copy of all of the negative reviews."
1,First One I Used Twice & Replacement -Once,My nylon balloon whisk from Kitchen Essentials-Calphalon looks just like the picture here. I purchased it from Target. The first one lasted through two home-made puddings & the replacement fell apart before I could even get the pudding to come to a complete boil. Now IF I could find some food safe glue I would glue the thing back into the handle. It's not worth taking back to the store. I paid $4.99 for it. It's a DUD!
1,People are still buying it! Why?!,"When I see this item is still on the top selling, I was amazed by how loyal these people to the brand name ""Calphalon""! Calphalon do make a quality cookware, but, on this whisk, it's a big mistake! It fell apart first time I used them unless the wires can be super glued to the handle. I am still wondering those who read the review and still purchase this product must have found the item delighted in some other ways. For example, falling apart might not be so bad since you can disassemble them and wash each and every part thoroughly!! Even though I don't like the part that it will fall apart, I do find it is quite handy when you use it to make a creamy kind of soup in the non-stick pot. You don't need the heavy-duty one to stir a pot of soup! Cheers!"
3,It's not the story I was expecting...,"Single Wife isn't the humorous, upbeat book I expected it to be; although, I enjoyed this book about 75% of the time, the other 25% I wanted to slap Grace. I couldn't wait for Grace to wake up and live her life for herself. She gives up her job, which she enjoyed, for her husband and then spends their marriage making up excuses for his mysterious absences. She doesn't confine in her family or friends during, which I assume, is the most difficult time in her life. I honestly thought she was going to have a breakdown. I was a bit disappointed at the end of the book. I wish the book was a bit longer and went into how Grace's life turned out."
5,Singly Wonderful,"This is a great read - intelligent, funny, moving and honest, everything you want in a novel. Anyone who can't get past the concept that someone might want to deny something like their husband leaving them either has no imagination or lives in some perfect universe most of the rest of us can't imagine. There are enough professional critics out there - it would be so nice if people would only write in about books they like. Or even, you know, ones they actually read."
4,"Not too heavy, not too light--A great first novel","Nina Solomon's book is full of some of the freshest writing I have read in quite a while. This particular story has a few holes and a couple of paths that lead to dead ends, but the characters are so real and interesting that I still really liked it. And once again, the writing is great. Solomon never seems to run out of new ways to describe things that a less artful writer would probably ignore just to avoid using cliches. (Or worse, would use cliches, which would sink this story with banality.)Oh, and I love the ending which you'll just have to read yourself. Knowing how and when to stop writing takes enormous skill. Kudos to Solomon and her editor just for that.Nina Solomon is definitely on my list of writers to watch. I can't wait to see what she does next."
4,Very good book....but not at all what I expected!,"The book was reviewed and advertised as being both funny and witty. Although the book was neither (most of the book simply makes you feel sorry for the main character)it was still an excellent read. If you are looking for something upbeat then find something else...but if you are looking for something that is entertaining, even if a bit unbelievable...the definately give Single Wife a try!"
5,Finding Grace,"I loved this novel. I read it over a weekend and continue to think about Grace, and all the other characters in this sweet,funny,thoughtful and engaging first novel. Nina Solomon did a fine job of weaving the secondary plotlines with the main plot of the missing husband. The satisfiying ending to this unique story left this reader eager to read her next book."
2,page-turner yet bad end,"Kept me reading and wondering, yet the end was silly. I thought more would happen with Laz in the end. Why didn't he call? Why didn't Grace wake up and search for him? What were all these little clues through the book that in the end seemed to mean nothing?"
2,"Interesting idea, bad book","Her husband has disappears and, instead of doing something about it, the protagonist decides to arrange his possessions on a daily basis as if he were still there, not to ease her grief, but to make sure the maid doesn't know he's gone. Mmmmmmmmkay. She's a rich, cold, bored housewife...no, not very likeable and certainly not a sympathetic character. Add to this the brief, inconsequential details of a conspiracy surrounding the husband's absence which, unfortunately, were not enough to keep me interested."
3,Interesting plot - tedious writing style.,"Single Wife starts off well enough, till you stumble across the word 'olfactory' for the 25th time in the second chapter and start to feel like you're reading a plot sketch rather than a finished novel. Perhaps the stilted prose is an intentional devise to illustrate the Stepford wife like world that the main character, Grace, has created for herself. However intentional or not, Solomon's stiff writing style wrings the color out of each and every character, rendering them into stick figures that interact with very unnatural impulses. I didn't feel any affinaty with Grace or any other character, however I did manage to skip through the chapters in an effort to discover the very contrived end to the mystery of missing husband Laz in the last chapter.This is a story that offers a great concept, but is doomed by methodical sentences and pedestrian plot points. In a more prosaic writer's hands this would have been a great read."
1,awful,Do not waste your money. Even if someone gives it to you do not waste your time. This book is worse that the worse sitcom. How do these things get published?
2,Slow and painful,"The novel was grammatically well written but painful slow in terms of the plot. The main character did not grab me and for the most part, struck me as being very idiotic. That was my main reason for not liking the novel. One of the other reasons at the top of my list is that it was not until page 232 or so that we finally got to the part where it seemed the wife was being followed, or that there was something sinister happening with her husband that could be a possible link to his disappearance. The jacket listed that as one of the selling points of the novel. I was not happy being made to read 200+ pages of the same nonsense only to get to what did not end up being as suspensful as promised. This novel was about 150 pages too long."
3,Unbelievable,"To enjoy Nina Solomon's first novel ""Single Wife"" one must first suspend one's disbelief that any modern, educated woman could be this dense, this out-of-touch with reality, this subjugated, this intentionally obtuse, this unimaginative and this phenomenally incurious. Oh, and for this story to work she also has to be rich, coddled, and basically stupid.This is not to say that it isn't an enjoyable read, because it is. The premise is interesting; a young woman desperately keeping up the appearance that her husband hasn't left her. And if the reader can keep from being frustrated by this immature dim wit, he or she will enjoy various literary allusions such as those to ""The Odyssey"" (Penelope weaving while her husband is away) and the 1944 thriller ""Gaslight"" (Charles Boyer tries to make Ingrid Bergman think she's nuts by dimming the lights).Solomon's writing is good and I'll definitely try her next novel. I'm hoping for something a little more believable, thought."
3,Page turner.....bad ending,"If not for all the un-answered questions, I would have given 5 stars.So many things were left out at the end. The lipstick, the matches, Laz's attitude. Why is Grace such a push over? How can her family and his be so blind.I would like to see a sequal to this book so that so many questions can get answered."
1,EDITED EPISODES!!!,"I can't believe it. Another TV show on DVD with syndicated/edited episodes. Why are they doing this? Great show, lousy DVD treatment."
5,About time!!,"All I can say is it's been long overdue! That's My Mama is a definite gem of the more obscure sitcoms of the 70's genre.Clifton Davis was so cute back in that period & has gotten even sexier over the years.I can't wait for my copies! I've waited years to see this available & i'm finally getting my wish. I implore fans of great 70's comedy to buy this series & add it to your collections, you won't be disappointed, it's quality stuff!!"
4,a cool show that didn't get it's due,"i watched this show in re-runs back in the 80's but it was cool. this was the show that spawned Randy Watson the PoliceMan that Boy is good line that Eddie Murphy&Arsenio Hall later used in the Film ""Coming to America"". Clifton Davis is a Very Versatile Entertainer. Ted Lange who later went on to the Love Boat as Issac the Crew Ship Bartender. Teddy Wilson who went on to ""Good Times""&Became Better known as ""Sweet Daddy Williams"". alot of Talent on this Show&it's a shame it didn't get it's full due.this film was a Pre-cursor to what Coming to America&the Ice Cube ""barbershop"" Franchises did years later."
3,Does anybody know what happened to the cast?,"I know the two older fellows (Josh & Wildcat) have passed on and the Clifton Davis is a preacher. Does anybody have the 'insider scoop' on why this show could not make it past two seasons and why so many cast changes?By the way, I do like it but its hard to keep up with the cast changes."
5,A fun album!,"It stuns me how Jane's Addiction is such an unknown band today, compared to Zeppelin and stuff... n e way, here r my revus 4 the songs:1. Stop! - (5/5)2. No One's Leaving - (5/5)3. Ain't No Right - (5/5)4. Obvious - (5/5)5. Been Caught Stealing - (5/5)6. Three Days - (999/5): This song is the album's weakness. It is SO good that it leaves all the other songs in the dust. The best head-banging experience I ever had!7. Then She Did... - (5/5)8. Of Course - (5/5)9. Classic Girl - (5/5)see, Jane's Addiction roks."
1,What the ***?,"Why take four godawful mini books and make them into one, horrendous novel? I suspect it's about the money. If you want to waste your money, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, if you want to be smart and save, don't bother. As Simon Cowell would say - this is absolutely dreadful."
1,Won't hold TV straight.,"Easy to install, but it wouldn't hold my 26"" LCD TV. Returned it for larger model."
5,Kids Rap Radio/Clean HIP-HOP for Kids by KIDS,"This is the album all parents have been waiting for. All the top rap hits performed by kids for kids. NO cursing, NO foul language.Just good clean fun for the entire family to enjoy. Makes a great holiday gift to any friend with kids. Hip-Hop is pop. Enjoy it now!"
4,Good stuff,This is the best cd of the series with songs that have been out of print for a while. Try and find Figures on a Beach anywhere.
3,<(Wide)Variety>,"Just Say Mao is a cool CD, offering a diverse mix of bands and musical styles, from synth-pop to hip-hop. I ended up enjoying most of it, some songs more than others...My favorites include: ""Everything Counts"" (Remix) by DM is so-so, but ""In A Manner Of Speaking"" by Martin Gore is awesome!/""Accidentally 4th Street (Gloria)"" by Figures On A Beach is a surprise gem./""Pistol"" by Erasure is decent./""Insha-Allah"" by NASA/""Thrash"" by Underworld/""Between Something And Nothing"" by The Ocean Blue is melodic and catchy.If there were half ratings I would give this a 3 and a half, which isn't bad at all. There are several other CD's available in the ""Just Say"" series as well."
3,Requires 8mm bearing spacers,"Copy does not say that these wheels need 8mm bearing spacers, but they do!"
4,"Great Book, lots of solid information.","This is a well written book. There is a ton of good information regarding group policy that you will not find anywhere else. The book comes with a resource CD which contains the book in PDF format, which is nice to have. I would recommend this as a must for any windows admin."
2,Microsoft Group Policy book,"Leave it to MS-press to take two well known Group Policy guys, Dereck and Darren and basically make a book that bores you to death. The whole book seems not to have any real ""flow."" It just rambles from here to there, putting out information which might be useful, if only there were some order to it. If you're looking for a better guide on Group Policies, Jeremy Moskowitz's book, ""Group Policy, Profiles and Intellimirror"" is a better bet. It's shorter, more consise and has a unified ""flow"" which can't be beat.In short, if you're crazy for MS-press books, go ahead and get this one. Else, save your money and go for the title from Moskowitz instead."
3,"Good content, but try to get the Hardcover edition","I bought this book for my Advance Corporate Finance class.There are a lot of interesting case studies. However, if you have the option, buy the hardcover version. The paperback version is in poor print quality (worse than any of my textbooks); not to mention the cover wears out very quickly."
5,THE GREAT TRANCE COLLECTION,"Armada Trance Collection Music have lots of of Unknown Tracks with Beautiful Melodies, and Energetic Beats, don't miss out any CD from Armada Trance, have GREAT MUSIC."
3,Not bad...Buy the self-titled disc!,"Bought The Break's self-titled disc and loved it! Absolutely stellar album. This one's good, too. I sense a bit more angst in these tunes. Not exactly the ""feel good"" sound of the first release. Pick up a copy of ""The Break"" first!"
5,soothing after a weary day,"This album has wonderful nature sounds opening and ending the tunes which are acoustic guitar ( some cello and flute recorder) which gives an earthy, soulful tone to the album. It would be nice massage music. I enjoy listening to it when i do my morning stretches. The original music composed and performed by Mr Livoti are melodic and mesmerizing. Enjoy listening. Keep producing Mr Livoti."
5,Borg Warner S5085 Solenoid Review,"Worked great for me. Just make sure you mount the wires properly.I mounted it without the spacer shims and it worked fine.About the only thing that I didn't like was that it didn't come with mounting bolts. I had to re-use the old philips-head screws. It would have been better to get new little bolts from the bolt store, but I was in a hurry and used the old screws."
5,I loved these shoes!!!,"I wish I could find these shoes again! These where one of my favorite pairs of shoes I have owned since becoming an adult. They are fun, high, and yet they still have a very classic shape. I was always complimented on these shoes. Unfortunately I wore them out (because I wore them so frequently) and I haven't found another pair of fun pumps that I liked so much since!"
5,gave as a gift,"my mom loves the ""a morning cup of ..."" series, so we purchased this to add to her personal library"
5,Superb,"Dwight Yoakam is the best natural country singer since George Jones. He has a distinctive style and voice which set him apart from the rest of the pack. This compilation offers an excellent sampler of some of his best early work, and all the elements are there: good material, excellent production, and spirited performances. There is not a bad cut on the entire album, which will leave the listener eager for more. As long as Dwight Yoakam is around, country music has a bright future. Thanks, Dwight!"
5,excellent,I don't know enough about 'country' to describe this CD with the right references -- all I can say is: buy it! You don't need to be a country fan to enjoy it.
1,Poor textbook overall,"If you're considering buying this book, DON'T unless you already know most of the material and only want it as a reference. It's extremely overpriced for the clarity that it offers to anyone attempting to learn for the first time. I am using it in my Modern Physics course right now and find that it is void of details necessary to offer a thorough, precise introduction. Derivations are poor to nonexistent and the text assumes absolute mastery (and memory) of basic physics. It does contain a decent coverage of the historical side of quantum mechanics; however, this should be supplementary, not a main focus."
4,Needed for class,"I loved this book. I've always been a huge fan of physics, so I took this course as an elective. This book does a great job of explaining some of the finer points of modern physics and presents some interesting thought experiments for more thorough understanding."
2,"Text is ok, but problems do not match well","This text works fine for reading and understanding the general ideas. I have read over 300 pages of it straight through and have a pretty good feel for the concepts presented. As far as reading a textbook is concerned, this one is not that bad.However, there is a serious disconnect between some of the end-of-chapter problems and the material presented in the text. Many times I have come across a problem that has no corresponding explanation/examples in the text. While I appreciate having to ""figure it out"" vs ""plug and chug"" the text presents so little information that it is worthless, forcing me to look elsewhere.What is the point of textbook problems if they require more than the text to figure out?"
2,Book only for physics enthusiasts,"I have read High School Physics books, Physics 1 & 2 college level, physical chemistry 1 & 2, and finally this book. I love learning concepts that aid in solving problems. In my physics reading experience, I loved all the physics books except this one. It goes through history and experiments too much and doesn't focus on the concepts. The book gives equations that are complicated (that is until you self teach yourself how they work). They skip all the derivation on how they come up with such grand equations which leaves me questioning how it works and applies to problems. In my opinion, I found doing the problems with outside information more helpful than using the book."
4,Modern Physics,"This is the book I needed for school and since it was offered in paperback, I bought it for much less than the school's bookstore. I am thankful for the savings."
2,A Little More Than Used,"The book was physically in good shape, but was almost completely highlighted and had several hand-written notes throughout. I think it was priced too high."
5,The Art of Ancient Egypt,"This book is excellent! I teach AP Art History and bought this book as a companion to the text used in my classroom. The textbook mentions topics breifly and gives little information. This book allowed me to explain the weighing of the heart.The Art of Ancient Egypt is not an over complicated book. It is written so that everyone can enjoy Egyptian art, not just the scholarly few. I treasure this book and have recommended it to my students."
2,Not good,"I don't consider myself a food snob by any means, but this isn't the best.The good stuff is a pure almond-sugar paste. This has a slight almond-lemony flavor that's loaded with corn syrup, definitely isn't the real deal. I would imagine if you grew up with this, you may have a nostalgic connection to it; you may like it if you like very sugary-tasting sweets.Personally I'll keep looking. I thought when I found it at T.J. Maxx it was a good deal but it was disappointing. Also, the fruits look dimensional through the box lid, but really they're cut in half. I'd love to be able to find someplace in the U.S. that offers the real fruit-shaped marzipan instead of these expensive substitutes. Bummer."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"Was disappointed that the magazine doesn't seem to be a complete issue. Very thin magazine -not sure it is worth the $120,- Is a little deceptive that this is not mentioned when ordering-was expecting the same magazine I knew and loved while living in Germany-too bad."
4,Science versus Pseudoscience,"I found this book easy to read it isn't full of scientific terms it is more conversational. He spent a bit more time on cold fusion than I would have liked, but it is interesting how true science works and how much pseudoscience is taken for real science. It was a surprise and a pleasure to know the truth about some of the subjects and how the media manipulates information. After reading this book I realized that real scientists have been lost to the average person. I think the average person may not know how science really works. The average person has been exposed to so much junk science. You may be shocked at what the government has spent of your tax dollars on pseudoscience or maybe not until you find out how it happened. I enjoyed this book and I was pleased to find that there are still some real scientists that work hard to find the truth."
5,Reason prevails,Robert Parks excellent book provides a clear roadmap for how strange beliefs begin. He correctly points out that frequently these ideas start out with just a basic misunderstanding of the principles involved in the processes at hand. When the principles become clear some will resort to fraud to keep the money and fame coming. I would highly recommend this book to the all scientist as well as the layperson interested in science and the scientific method. It is an even handed look at junk/voodoo/fraudulent science.
5,An excellent review of junk science,"This book does a wonderful job of explaining bad science to a general reader. You don't need to know any physics or chemistry to read, understand, and enjoy this book. He discusses subjects like cold fusion, electromagnetic radiation, homeopathy, touch therapy, and host of other dubious claims. He does this clearly and logically and he points out that many people start down these paths with honest intentions but somehow cross the line into lunacy or fraud. I would recommend this book to anybody. He doesn't have the usual manner of a skeptic who pokes fun of practitioner of bogus science, he just explains what they are trying to say and clearly demonstrates that they are overwhelmingly wrong and in may cases trying to steal innocent poeple's money. Get the book you won't we sorry. He makes the point that the more the public knows about science the less likely it is to get duped by voodoo science."
4,"fraud,silliness and junk science","This is an excellant book that covers illustrative topics of bad science such as homeopathy,cold fusion and perpetual motion machines. In a readable article like style, Park uses and explain clearly the scientific problems with these issues. He gives excellant descriptions about several pepetual motion machines by discussing thermodynamics and electrical dynamic theory that even a chemist as myself can enjoy. He tends to turn poltical at the end of the book wth a negative description of SDI amd Dr Teller. Science should not dabble in politics so the author's Democratic party bias should be excluded.If your politics lean toward the right this might detract from this book. The book could have covered either fraud,junk science or bad science only. By lumping all these things together it may not be clear where bad science ends and fraud appears. The book appears to have been written as smaller articles for publication and combined."
4,An easy to read and witty critique,"There are a number of books on the market that discuss the pitfalls of bad science, or non-science and this is one of the easier to read books on the subject. It is disturbing to know that in an era of high technology, we can be deceived so easily into accepting absurd claims. It seems that there are just some things that we really WANT to believe are true, even though they cannot be true. This book is certain to make people uncomfortable, but the author's style is such that it should also make you laugh about your own misconceptions. I know I was caught off guard by some of the examples in the book!"
2,hmmmm,"Mr Park does have some testicular fortitude for even puting this book out. But, occult practices is nothing to fool with and even though this book has some pointers, he is not GOD!! with all the studies he could attribute through his years he can never know the true answers to WHY!! things happen and how. He just got an idea in his head and he put it on paper next thing you know BAM!! he got a book out. He is simply using reverse psychology on his viewers and enough said. Still dont get it? If you already dont believe in voodoo you will most likely get this book but if you do believe but have some doubts you will most likely get this book. I got the book to try and see what is going thru this mans head to even disrespect this practice,religion,you know voodoo."
3,"A Great Author, But Only A Good Book","I liked the book, don't get me wrong, but it simply is not all that good of a book. It's importance as a groundbreaker in American Gothic is a very large one, but I feel that the book will be lost on the every day readers, who will be put off by both the language and the rather silly way in which it ends. The whole book is a build up of mystery and then out of the shadows the criminal steps forward and gives a speech (a long one I might add) on how the whole thing happened. So long as you accept the fact that this will happen at the end, you should like it, but if not, then stay away. The book is quite a let down (I just can't stand the ending), especially for being Brown's best read novel. If you want to read the book (and it really is a good book), just stop before the last chapter."
4,The First of the Hollywood Musicals,"While this was the second film to win the best picture Academy Award, it was, in fact, a film of a number of firsts. It was the first all talking, all singing musical. Bessie Love, a name we certainly don't hear today, was nominated as best actress. She lost to Mary Pickford (Coquette).The film is somewhat dated, but don't forget it is over 70 years old. However, that notwithstanding, two songs, the title song and You Were Meant for Me, still hold up well. It is worth watching for for at least its historic value."
5,THE JAZZ AGE COMES ALIVE!,"If you weren't there, this is likely the closest you'll come to experiencing the sights and sounds of the Jazz Age. The pall of the Great Depression descended right on the film's heels and nothing was the same again. But in this spirited romp of a musical there's no hint of what was to come. The story, to be sure, is a bit hackneyed by today's standards, but the music and performances are full of life and the picture fairly vibrates with jazzy energy. Grab yourself a bathtub-gin martini and pop this one into the moving picture victrola - and try to keep your feet still!"
2,Not quite unwatchable,"There are movies that I have been unable to sit through. This is not one of them.Of course, this is hardly a ringing endorsement. While it certainly has historical value, its entertainment value is a harsh reflection of the iron-pirite age of cinema. Talkies were fresh out of the gate and it shows: the erratic editing, poor cinematography, the dialogue that reads like silent-film intertitles, and histrionic acting are high camp and quite funny at times."
4,Avoid Heartland Computers,We bought the Zonet print server from Heartland computers. The server did arrive on time & was what we had ordered. What we didn't know is that Zonet is out of business & there is obviously no warranty. The phone was not being answerd at Heartland computers & they do not respond through their e-mail. there is no other contact informtaion on their website.Altoghter a very direputable company. Avoid Heartland Computers. Avoid Zonet if a warranty is something of importance.
1,Tech Support??,"I was unable to install this device. So I have no idea if it even worked. The drivers would not load either from the provided disk or from the Zonet web site. The quick start booklet apparently was not written by a native English speaker. I was able to open the documentation on the DVD, but it ws of no help. I then sent a detailed e-mail to their tech support describing my problem. Twelve days later I still have not received a reply. I've twice left messages at their tech support phone number, never got a human. The answering machine suggested I send an e-mail to them or leave a number so they could call me. I asked that they read my e-mail and call. No one ever did. I dont have time to waste waiting for them so I sent it back to Amazon today and ordered a D-Link print server. I've got my fingers crossed. -D. Becker, St Louis, MO"
5,Keeper book,"I will keep this book even though it was a required textbook for a research class. I have found this book to be very easy to read and understand. The author uses brilliant examples that bring the concepts to life. The book is very well organized, and the workbooks are wonderful in reinforcing and practicing the material. I find it easy to use as a reference which is why I will keep this book. If every textbook was like this one we could all learn by reading the text."
4,great service! book didnt arrive so conacted seller and sent 1 asap!,"great service! book didnt arrive so conacted seller and sent 1 asap!i waited for the book after 2 weeks and contacted the seller- then i received the book 2 days after contact and very satisfied with service, customer service, and quality of textbook!"
1,"How to design and evaluate research in education with a Student CD,Workbook, and Power Point Research Methods","I am not at all pleased. I paid for the textbook, student CD, workbook, and the complete package. All I got was the textbook. I want my money back! I may not order from Amazon in the future if my orders are not sent properly."
3,"Just a little taste of the ""Ragun' Cajun""","There are few artists that can get the fiddle to sing like Kershaw, but the best of Doug Kershaw should really be a lot longer and have some live cuts on it.Think of this as an appetizer. ""Louisiana Man,"" with Kershaw's depiction of life on the bayou is a necessity for anyone who enjoys this type of music, and there is a good cover of Hank Williams's classic ""Jambalaya"" but the sound overall is very thin and does not do this artist justice. If it's all you can find it's better to have some Kershaw than none, but keep looking, you can do better."
2,"these don't fit, leaks","I am a regular swimmer, I swim 6 days a week. I have tried many earplugs: mack's pillow soft ear plugs,mack's aquablock ear plug, howard leight aquaseal ear plug, and arena ergo liquid silicone ear plug. In the beginning, I used mack's pillow soft ear plugs, but then after 3 days, it would start leaking water into my ear. So I switched to mack's aquablock ear plug, still does't fit, water leaks in. Then I tried arena ergo, I figure since it's the most expensive swimming earplug on amazon, it must worth a try. It turns out hurts my ear, I couldn't even fit it in. $16 down the drain. Finally I tried howard leight aquaseal ear plug, WOW, waht a difference, perfect fit, never leaks. I am so happy. I am never going back to other brands again."
2,Don't Work For Me,"I have an ear canal that doesn't seem to hold any type of ear plug (even my MP3's) well, so because these are so soft I can't work them far enought into the canal to stay put. If you don't have that problem, they ARE very soft so should work well for a ""normal"" person."
2,Hum,"I swim laps regularly and want to avoid swimmer's ear. These worked better than the drugstore ""20 in a pack"" type but didn't hold up to a 15 lap swim."
4,Great Earplugs!,"I've been using these plugs for quite awhile now...they are simply the best. Used to buy them @ Walmart but, guess what? Walmart isn't carrying them anymore! Big Shock! Will continue to buy them as long as available. Thanks!"
2,Poorly made Earplugs,These earplugs work great for about 10-15 uses & then thet start to fall apart on the edges & become useless. I have tried 3 pairs & all they all started to flake apart in about the same amount of uses.
2,Need to be larger,"I don't have large ears, but they slip out when I'm underwater swimming. They are comfortable and came quickly in the mail, but if you don't have small ear openings, you may have the same problem."
5,Ahhhhhhhh I can sleep in peace,I'm so glad I found these on Amazon because my store quit carrying them. These are the only ear plugs that stay in my ears all night and block the sound better than any of the others I have tried. My husband snores and Macks help me get some peace and quiet.
5,Works well,"I use these earplugs while swimming laps at the gym. The keep the water out, yet they do not entirely block sound out, which is a good thing."
4,very good,first time using aqua block ear plugs.they are very good and fix to the ear with out problems.very good material.
5,Excellent author,"I think this book was more advanced than I was able to handle, considering I was a beginner computer user. Nevertheless, when Ie-mailed the author 3-4 times, he was always professional, courteous, and willing to help. It's a great book and has an author who stands behind his product. If you are into web-page design, this book is definitely worth its money."
5,Help Me!,"A friend gave me the book to read a few years ago. It was great! It helped me to see the controlling part of my personality. I didn't know how damaging it was to me and others. Now, I need to share it with others who are struggling with the same issues, but I can't find a copy. Please let me know where I can find this book."
5,Double take,"You have to look twice to notice these aren't silver. I bought them even though my daughter said she didn't like them in the picture, but when they arrived she fell in love. Also, I might mention, they are large pieces so my husband likes the way they feel in his hand. Their beautifully feminine pattern balances out their size. We had a bunch of macho guys over for dinner with their wives and, male and female alike, they all thought they were awesome."
2,Its alright I guess,"The book has some useful content but lacks any real meat. It just skims the surface of the slang world and moves on when it starts to get interesting. After reading the book, I felt I had only read a preview of what could have been an amazing collection of pages if written with more depth."
4,awesome!!!! clurtural relation,This is great for one on one conversations...makes us less like a tourist. The exchanges students here thought we were cool...my cousins shared this
3,Be careful!!!!,"By just looking few pages...Becareful that many words are dead words and very funny.It is very funny book to read, but I dont recomend to learn from it (if you dont want to be funny person)However, if you are planning to go to Japan, it will be a great attention getter book (^-^)"
3,Extremely Graphic Content,"Before buying this book, you should be aware that it is extremely graphic. You don't just learn how to tell someone off. You also learn how to instruct your hooker in unusual sex practices. This is truly no-holds barred DIRTY Japanese."
5,Dirty Laughs,"A fantastic book to sit with your mates and just have a laugh. A lot of these frases are very seldom used amongst the general public and if you go to Japan you'll probably only use the friendlier side of the book. The cursing and the ero ero nihongo parts are for closer friends and as I wrote earlier a great gag at a casual gathering with friends, even better if alcohol is included.It is definetly not to be taken too seriously but it is idiomatically correct through and through. I asked a Japanese friend to look through it and there were no mistakes spotted which is a good sign. In many slang books frases tend to be obsolete or slightly mistranslated but no such errors found to my knowledge."
3,Mama desu,"Eh, it was alright. Could have been dirtier. It's mostly a phrase book for beginners with various items that are a bit taboo. When I lived in Japan I learned way dirtier stuff."
2,Beware...,"I am a student of the Japanese language so I bought a copy of ""Dirty Japanese"" thinking it would nicely round out my education, which is mostly from staid textbooks. Well, I showed it to a bunch of my Japanese friends, and they were laughing their a**es off at the extent to which many of the phrases in the book were either inaccurate or simply dated. I admit this book is somewhat humorous to read even if you don't speak Japanese at all, but beware, you might not be learning anything useful by reading it."
1,Huge disappointment.,"I wanted to learn some Japanese slang. I have about ten different Japanese phrasebooks and dictionaries that I use very often. [ By that, I mean daily. ] This book is NOT one of them! The author seemed like just some guy who thought he'd try to brag about going to Japan.. So that was distracting enough. But I bought this before I really knew the difference between female and male sentence-ending particles. He never explained which gender said what. Now that I know, I'm even more angry that most of it that wasn't gross was meant for men only. So, if you're a man who isn't a complete jerk, or if you're just some chick who loves the Japanese language, like me, do not get this book. The only phrases for women make us all look bad!"
3,Not so 'dirty'..,"This book lexics makes it look more like a not-too-hard-core slang phrase-book rather than uncensored raw language guide. Some words that you would expect to find (and I shall not say them here) are plainly missing.The book also gives very brief and unclear rules how to pronounce romanized words (like what is 'z': 'ts' or 'dz', for instance, etc.). The book also does not use too much of Kan-ji characters, which, having the meaning that fits such a book, can be quite pictorial..."
1,"not true to size, very ugly","I read all the 4 good review, and decided to spend 50 bucks on these boots for Halloween costume, I got it this morning, and I am very disappointed.It looked very cheap, and when I put it on, I found that it is way too tight in the angle, and I am already order half size bigger than I normally would wear. The angle is too tight, but when it comes to the knees, it is too loose,I am a skinny girl, normally goes size 2 in US, I am surprised that anything would be too small for me!so it is very tight on the leg, and the angle part even fold, and the knee part is too big, it just looked so stupid.I am contacting the seller about this issue, I will renew my feedback after I contact them."
5,What was I thinking????,"I bought the soundtrack to ""Batman Begins"" a few years ago and really liked it. I considered it the best ""Batman"" score. Then, a few weeks ago, I bought Danny Elman's original score from ""Batman"". While I still like ""Batman Begins"" (I like Zimmer and JNHoward), I ask myself now, WHAT WAS I THINKING??? This score is vastly more complex and enjoyable."
5,AMAZING!,"Greatings friends! This is just to say that if you have ever watched several movies and they have made you think of, or want to watch, other movies...then you may find out what I have just recently found out. The music composer may just be the same person for all those movies. Danny Elfman is one of the greatest composers I have ever come across. So much so, that I have even decided that Danny was worth my money. That's right, no stealing from the internet or listening on YouTube. He earned my money and has done it so well, that I have no bad feelings taking it out of my pocket to give it to him. I hope he continues on with many movies and even makes a few more theater stage performaces(Serenada Schizophrana). Check out all of his work if you can. You wont be disapointed!"
4,Review,"Danny Elfman did not just bring to life a great opening theme song he also brought to life the spirt of the Batman movies. Danny Elfmans score for Batman was a very great, and it had a dark tone to it, and that i think was what he wanted to go for. This CD was amazing but it was to dark of a score."
5,Excellent!,"I rarely give 5 stars to a movie score/soundtrack but this one deserves it. The music is great. If you've seen the mvoie you'll know what I mean. If not, take my work and everyone else here who rated this 5 stars!"
4,Revolutionary,"But, this score just isn't AS good as the sales show. Do not get me wrong, I enjoy this score as much as the rest of you every time I listen to it. But, as a whole, the score just isn't in the league as some others. The action cues are all incredible (The Batman Theme - Batman to the Rescue - Charge of the Batmobile, Attack of the Batwing). Even better than those, though, are the dark, dramatic cues (Decent into Mystery - The Batcave - Childhood Remembered). But, unfortunately, there are so many goofy tracks. While they are not bad, they do kind of get in the way of a good, serious score. The movie was fun, serious, and goofy all at the same time (and was still awesome). I just don't like to listen to goofy music by itself, unfortunately. Does this ruin the score? Absolutely not. It is still a great listen every now and then. There ARE better scores out there, though... By Elfman and other composers."
3,Batman Rocks!!,This brought back memories of my childhood!! The Batman theme is cool. Thanks AMAZON.com!!
3,Gift,This was purchased for our son. I do not care for this type of score in music. Our son listens to the music for a while then discards the CD.
2,Don't Really Care For This Soundtrack!,"Well it's better than that horrible and bizarre Batman soundtrack from Prince but it's not exactly a favorite of mine, it's kind of dull compared to Danny Elfman's lively scores for Beetlejuice, and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It's not a horrible soundtrack it's just a little too dull for my taste and the only track I like is the Batman theme itself!"
3,I'm of a mind to make some music,"This music worked perfectly within the context of the movie. But as a stand alone listening experience, it doesn't hold up that well. But if you enjoy orchestral movie scores, you may enjoy it more than I do."
4,Batman: Original Motion Picture Score CD,"I thought the Batman score was brilliant, although some of the music that they had from the 1989 movie wasn't on the CD. For example, the bit at the beginning when the boy and his parents got mugged in the alley way. Jack meets up with Eckhart. The Axis Chemical plan with boss Carl Grissham. And a few others that I thought should be good enough to be on the CD.My favorite would have to be all of it, but track no. 17 would have to be my pick where the Joker and Vicky Vale going up Gotham City Cathedral and definately The Waltz (track no.18). I loved the Smiley tune that was not on the CD but in the movie where the Joker interrupts the news footage advertising his new Joker brand. That's tune's really fun to listen to. If you loved the movie, then this would be an ideal CD for you. Don't be dissapointed though that some music from the movie is not on the CD because it is still good to listen to."
5,It's a dark night ...,"You're standing, alone, in a dim, dingy Gotham alley. Suddenly, a mugger grabs you from behind, but before you can utter a word, a dark figure swoops down and knocks the mugger out. Before you can utter a ""thank you,"" the mysterious, bat-like thing is gone. This is the spirit that Danny Elfman conveys in ""Batman."" The music fits the movie like a bat-glove. The dark, shadowy overtones make it a great atmospheric CD. It's absolutely my favorite soundtrack. Can we give a CD six stars?"
1,DANGEROUS SHATTERING GLASS!,"I have owned this for about 9 months now and used it daily. I loved it and thought it was a perfect size, strength, etc. I never had any issues with warping as some others have mentioned. HOWEVER, the handle came off the lid (randomly, during a gentle hand-wash) the other day and when I went to screw it back on the lid shattered into about a million little pieces, all over my kitchen and living room. I still have tiny shards of glass in my carpet. I was bleeding from about 16 small cuts on my arms and legs. It shattered without warning and without too much pressure being put on the glass. I will never buy a T-Fal product again because this shattered without any warning, pressure, etc. and I do not trust it around anyone. Thank God my 2-year old was napping because then he'd be covered in small shards of glass just like I am. Never again buying T-Fal."
3,If you have a glass top stove. . .,"If you have a glass top stove, you may want to know that the bottom of this cooker has metal ridges. It is not flat. Hopefully they will add that in the description in the near future as I feel that is important to know. Also, a picture of the bottom would be nice. I'm returning it to Amazon, thanks to their wonderful customer service, it's not a problem."
2,Not for ceramic cooktops,"I have several pieces of nonstick T-fal which I have used for over 15 years with no problem. When I bought a new stove with a flat ceramic cooktop, I bought this pan to use on it. It has concentric grooved circles on the bottom, when I needed a flat bottomed pan. The pan is light, yet worked well on the first couple of uses. As I have used it a few more times, the pan has warped sides up. When the pan is hot , you can see almost a 1/4 inch gap between the sides and the surface of the cooktop. The cooking is not even, and the pan spins when you adjust it. The pan has not scratched, and I have not had issues with the lid, as other buyers have had. Perhaps someone who needs a lightweight large deep pan with a regular surface could use this pan."
3,You're better off in stores,"Arrived with a large chunk of the main handle chipped off. After it arrived, I looked in Marshall's and saw the same pan for the same price, but the one in the store seemed to be of higher quality (thicker and sturdier where the handle attaches to the pan; store handle was insulated and amazon one was just plastic). Had the handle not been chipped, I would have kept the pan and used it and thought it was good. But obviously T-Fal has differing levels of their lines, like most companies. I could not see where one would distinguish between them while shopping online. Slightly different colors on the cardboard sleeve, best as I can tell. Which is not something you see while online! BTW, I have a T-fal saucepan (from Marshall's) that I love."
3,The quality not as good as expected,The quality is not as good as I expected. the bottom is not even after we used it for 6 months. We deep fry a lot I dont know if that is the reason or not.
3,Heavy and bigger than I needed...,The quality is as good as any T-Fal... However it is bigger than I expected; and therefore heavier... The weight makes it difficult to clean and serve from.
1,Chipped,"One month into using it with utmost care, The inside was already chipped/cracked. It's not like we used knives or forks on scraping the inside, but there were a few scratches in the middle. I'm thinking it really is of poor quality."
4,T-Fal Specialty 5-Quart Nonstick Jumbo Cooker with Glass Lid,"This cooker is probably as close to excellence as you can get--within the price range. So far it seems solid and true to its design, and the price helped."
1,save your money,"I have had this fry pan since October 2010. I replaced it for another t fal I had, that also warped. I cannot believe it has warped already. I will save my money for a better brand next time."
1,Do not buy!!!,This pan is a second. It has a rounded middle so the oil only goes around the edges. It is a useless pan. Gave it away with a warning to the receiver of this pan. NEVER BUY THIS PAN!!!!!
2,Not good for glass cooktops,"This pan has left several scratches on my glass cooktop range. The bottom is not flat, it has ridges which scratch the ceramic surface very easily."
1,"Adequate, but flumsy and small handle can fracture over gas","* When I received this pan, its lip was slightly rippled near the handle. Presumably this was from stress on the handle from shipping. I am not comforted by the fact that I could straighten out the warped lip with my thumbs.* The small handle fractured in two places when heating over a large gas burner.You don't get what you don't pay for.The pan appears to function adequately so far.UPDATE - 12/20/2012: The knob on the lid became a little loose, so I tried to tighten it. The core of the knob broke away from the knob. Now the lid is knob-less. This crap gets a one-star down-grade to a total score of one star. I paid a junk price and that is just what I got."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm an experienced cook & the 3 star rating is very generous. The pan is not flat..bowed up in the middle. After cooking chicken in the pan I & others noticed a strange flavor in the meat, I threw out the chicken. I plan on giving the pan away..no takers, I'll toss it out."
4,Good for its price,"Good stuff, just a little bit too big for our fire place... So you need to move it around several times to make it heat every thing in it when you cooking food."
2,the lid is dented,"I havent actually used the pan yet, because I just opened it and the metal part of the lid is all dented up. The part that actually goes down into the pan, on one side, is bent in. Errr..I'm sure the pan part is good. I was very excited to receive it, but am now unhappy."
5,Great,Came fast and as described. I am enjoying the cooker and would recommend it to others to order. Its huge and I cook almost everything in it.
5,Great Cooker/Large Fry Pan,"The cooker's shape, with steeper sides than a saute pan, is excellent for both cooker and large fry pan usage. The non-stick works very well, and the handles are sturdy and well designed for heavier loads. The glass lid is vented and has a metal rim where it rests on the pan edge - a major design improvement. Overall, an excellent cooker/fry pan at a reasonable price."
4,Works Well,"This cooker works really well, but it's almost too big. It takes a little while to get warmed up on my stove and it doesn't really fit in my sink to clean. However, clean up is really simple as the nonstick coating works extremely well on this cooker. The lid is nice too."
5,Ggod all around skillet for a family,"I have tried all kinds of ""stove ware"" and have owned a number of non-stick skillets. The fact is that none are ""forever ware"" in the sense of maintaining a non-stick surface. I like T-Fal because it is reasonable cost and well constructed. I particularly like this skillet as it is heavy and distributes the heat well. The lid is a nice element, and the handles make moving the food easy."
2,Made in China not France,Although this has the T-Fal name it is made in China and not France like the rest of the T-Fal line. The non-stick surface isn't very non-stick adn doesn't have the RED DOT to tell you when it gets hot like the rest of the T-Fal line. Definitely not up to par like the rest.
1,Not up to T-Fal quality,"We have several T-Fal pans and this is just not up to the same standards. We have only had it for about one month and it looks like it is 10 years old. The paint is not very good and scratches quite easily. The handle is loose with no way to tighten it. The weight of the pan is tinny. Now reading the experience another buyer had with the glass lid, I am seriously considering sending it back. As I said, we own several of the T-Fal pans and they are all made 10 times better than this one."
5,Another awesome T-fal product.,"I love T-fal, and this pan is perfect for me. I've always had weak wrists, so the added handle makes moving it when it is full very much easier. The see-through lid is wonderful so that I don't have to lift and lose heat in order to check progress. I bought 2 and am happy to have them since I cook for 4 adults and 3 kids every night. I would definitely buy this again."
5,Nice Pan,"I can finally cook my spaghetti sauce in this after I have browned my meat and have room to play so if I want to add the noodles in to make on big dish, I can."
5,t-fal nonstick 5 quart,"My fiance' loves this frying pan. I visited him on leave and i wanted to threw all his worthless crap out when I was cooking dinner one night. When I return to from leave, I ordered him this pan and he is in love with it!! Thanks"
5,Best pan,"For the price, this is the perfect pan. I basically use this just about every time I cook. It's the perfect size for big batch meals with leftovers. Nothing sticks to it, so you don't need to use oil. I would buy this item again in a heartbeat."
4,A great buy,"Just got about a week ago and its great, only need to cook on med-low with this pan , it distributes heat well and cleans very easy, the non stick is great! its an all in one, deep enough to make just about anything. The only draw back is the handle for the glass lid is more wide then tall and is not as easy to grasp especially when the lid gets warm. I saw that one review stated an issues with the lid shattering, it does heat up quickly and you do have to let it cool on its own before going to wash it even tempered glass has limits. But a great by for the price, i have purchased pans of lesser quality and had them last about 4-5 years so i expect this one to last at least double that. Hope this helps :)"
5,Cooks and Cleans like a dream,"Everything tastes better when it is cooked in this pan. Nothing sticks and a soapy sponge cleans it like new. I have alot more expensive pans that I don't use anymore..thank you T-Fal.T-Fal 5-Quart, 12-Inch Total Nonstick Jumbo Cooker, Black"
1,You get what you pay for,"This is very poor quality. It arrived damaged, but I tried using it. Bad idea. Sent it back. Pay the extra and get a better quality skillet."
3,"Holds everything, doesn't distribute heat","Pros:Can cook for an army in itlightweighteasy to cleangood at steam cooking on low heatCons:The heat does not distribute at all. Things in the middle burn, things on the outside edges are raw.Lid is a little flimsy. The alumnim around the edge was bent in transport though it was adequately packaged and sustained no damage. Good news is it was so flimsy I could bend it right back."
2,the pan Warped really Bad,"This 5qt pan is not worth the money. It warped the first time I used it and no longer has a flat bottom. I had thought it was a good value, but if it does not hold up then it is not. My stove & the bottom of the pan Warped really Bad."
1,Good while it lasted - 4 uses!,"As others mentioned, this pan is made in China. It's lightweight and not sturdy. However it looked nice upon arrival. After 4 uses, it has warped. It no longer sits flat on the surface (a flat cooktop) and a gentle nick on the handle sends it spinning away. It was used a total of 4 times over 2 weeks. Now to see what T-Fal will do for me. It was not put in the oven or used over high heat or abused in any way."
1,spend more on quality,"cheap is cheap, this pan does not even sit level on my flat top electric stove top"
1,handle trouble,"This looked great and I bought it based on other amazon reviews about Tfal vs others available on amazon at this pricepoint, but I returned this item as the handle was loose and would not tighten. Of course, this problem may be limited to the one I received, but I decided not to ask for a replacement as I thought this could be a problem in time for any pan constructed this way (the handle screwed to the pan, but the screws had limited ability to tighten.) As always, it was easy to return to amazon; however, I did lose my ""free shipping"" discount on another item I bought with the pan."
1,Scratches Smooth Cooktops,"This product scratches smooth cooktops. We sent ours back to T-Fal and they claimed we must have had salt under the pan that caused the scratches, which is ridiculous."
3,The handle was damaged upon delivery,"The cooker seems to be of good quality, a little bit bigger and heavier than I expected. The worst thing is the handle was damaged after shipping. I won't return for an exchange though because it's too much of a hassle to do so."
3,Just So So,"Here again, not near the quality of the T-fal Ultimate Set and the handle want to come loose. Can't help but wonder if someone isn't making this for T-fal."
3,Misdirected Visuals,"I was pretty bummed by this Video. You can research Faberge's life in print, but when the research is presented through a visual medium, you expect to see something besides old photographs and prints. The objects Faberge's studios produced were phenomenal for their perfection and ingenuity, but the camera passes over them so fast! There's no time to study them in total because of the artistic license taken with the photography. Bummer."
3,family pack entertainer.,". The entire portion revolving around Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha and Mushakraj, in animation format, not only enlightens the viewer, but takes the film to a different level. Also, the interaction between the kid and Lord Ganesha is wonderful.Direction [Rajiv S. Ruia] is interesting in parts. Music is fair.Ahsaas Channa, the kid, is confident. Kiran Janjani does well.Definitely this is good family pack entertainer."
5,Amazing geologist!,"I had Chernicoff as a geology professor at the University of Washington, and we used his book. Not only were his classes fascinating, but his book was fabulous. The way he put it together and explained everything was fantastic; he excells at making those of us foreign to the world of geology interested in the subject (especially undergrads who are taking a geology class because it's required!). Furthermore, he does so in a way that is easily understandable and not at all confusing. He gives countless examples of what he is describing throughout, making the material even more easy to digest. It is easy to tell that he has a passion for what he does; it shows through in his writing. This is a perfect starting place for those interested in geological matters."
5,Superior Read,"Reading this book was like visiting with old friends, the kind you invite into your home and the kind you don't want to leave. I didn't want the book to end. I enjoyed seeing Kristine grow in character, loved Woodie and his insight and the true to life kids boggled my mind. Very,very real and easy to relate to. I absolutely fell in love with the animals. Super, super book!"
2,Flat Characters,"Very little character development. I didn't like the ""heroine"" most of the time because she was incredibly stupid. I hoped to see her ""grow"" but was disappointed throughout the story as she never really developed. The overall plot of the book was good, but the poor writing ruined it. I flipped to the end to find out what happened and let it go at that."
1,Great Disappointment!!!,This book reads as though it is a working draft not a finished novel. The author should treat her fans with more respect. The plot development is non existent and many of the events simply so far fetched to be totally without credibility. Don't waste your time or money with this one!
1,first time reader of Fern Michaels - hated it!,"I agree with the reader who called this book ""sophomoric garbage."" How can anyone with a modicum of good sense and intelligence enjoy this drivel. The dialogue is simplistic, the characters totally one dimensional, the plot insipid. Who could care about this stupid woman? She married the kind of man she deserved and her children justifiably deserted her. I was sorely tempted to desert her too, but, out of fairness to the author, forced myself to finish the story. That was a mistake. Totally unbelievable. By the way, did anyone else notice that on page 83 her name is spelled ""Christine"" by mistake in the middle of the page. That sort of thing drives me crazy. Did no one even read this book before it was published? Can't blame 'em."
4,Wonderful,"I thought this book was very well written! It was the first book that I have read by this author and hope to read more from her! I thought she cried a little too much for me, but by the end of the book I was cheering her on! What a great book!"
5,Teriffic read!,Celebration is one of those books that come along once in a while. The kind that you can't wait to get back to. I found it to be exceptional. I liked the interaction between the family members. It rang true. All the characters came to life between the pages. I loved some and hated others. When a writer attacks your emotions you know he/she has done his/her job. The ending blew me away. Very good book. EM
5,A wonderful book! Five Plus,What a book. Terrific plot and great realistic characters. Even the lesser characters took on a rich and full life. I found this to be skillfully written packed with excitement that never eases up. Super book like all Michaeals' books. Each one is better than the last. Jade Liu
2,Fern -- how could you?,"I adore Fern Michaels -- but how could she create a character so completely devoid of ANY backbone? One minute she is drinking her way to oblivion because her children don't like or respect her (her own fault) and the next, she is right back to being a wimp for her awful husband. I truly, truly was disappointed. Fern's people and their dialog is her strength -- what happened?"
3,Great.....,I really enjoyed this book. It is easy reading and did not take me long to finish the book. Typical of Fern Michaels. I truly love her books and have not been disappointed ever.
2,Not one of Fern Michaels' best!,"This book had the potential to be very interesting, but the dialogue throughout seemed really fake. It was almost uncomfortable reading parts of it because you know that people would not interact that way in real life. If you're a big Fern Michaels fan, pick another book and skip this one!"
1,A waste of time!,"This book was absolutely awful...My first F. Michaels and definately my last. Many times I considered putting it down, but I persisted, hoping it would get better.....was I wrong...I couldn't seem to find any empathy for any of these characters...nothing made much sense and their behaviour was at best illogical. Don't bother with this one."
1,NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR?,I must admit I got sucked into buying this book by the blurb at the top about New York Times Bestseller. I don't believe it! Talk about a book based on nothing but dialog. Never do you see beneath the spoken word to any kind of real people below the surface. I quit. I don't even care enough to find out what happened to Logan.
3,Too much crying!,"I enjoyed the storyline of this book - but Kristine never stopped crying! I got really tired of reading about Kristine crying over everything. She is a very weak woman, could not stand on her own two feet and the crying was way over done."
4,Enjoyable,I enjoyed this book but then I like Fern Michaels writing. The story was well told and I hope there's a sequel.
5,great characterazation of animals & people,"Celebration is a story you do not want to put down. The plot is not easy to figure out so you just keep reading & never get bored. The animals in the story just make the book & you fall in love with them. The celebration in the story is a wonderful feeling of things being done right to correct mistakes made by our ancestors long ago & gave me a gooooood feeling. It is just a good book !!!!!!!! Fern Michaels has a unique way of telling her stories & I never want her books to end. I always read them slowly ,so that I don't miss a word or thought. Susan Manning"
5,Simply great,"This book is a must read!!!! Kristine Kelly's weaknesses and finding her inner strength makes for a wonderful story that could be believed.Even the way her children behaved when the shock of what their father did was so real. One has to wonder how many wives have gone through situations like this or have stayed in abusive marriages. Cried when the off-spring began to realize how wronged their mother had been and loved when they expressed their wishes for ""dear old dad"". To me the ending was perfect. I know I will read it again before too long."
3,Is ANYONE this COCKY?,"I was hoping for a better read than what I got. I found it hard to believe that anyone could be as cocky as Logan, as self-sacrificing as Kristine or as sit back and wait as Woody. It just wasn't a believeable book to me, while it should have been. The plot had potential, the characters just didn't pan out."
4,Celebration,"This book was amazing. The plots kept coming and I couldn't put it down. It was a little bit long, and repetive, but her overall style is personally appealling to me. I felt like I knew Kristene and when I was finished, I felt almost sad, that it was over, and I wouldn't be able to read more about her. The ending was great, and I really enjoyed it."
3,"No James or Florida Evans, but its still funny","In Good Times, JJ is the head of the Evans houshold. Florida got remarried, and living else where with her new husband, and James was killed in a car accident the season before. This season has a very good and serious episode, which I thought was the best of the whole season, which deals with child abuse.To be quite honest, this season was funny, but it didn't have the same ""umf"" as the previous ones. JJ was good as a more serious and responsible character but I miss ""kid dy-no-mite"""
5,Wilona Shines,In season five we are introduced to a little girl in a bad situation. Janet Jackson joins the cast as Esther Rolle leaves the show for a while. The Evans kids really show remarkable growth into adult hood in season five. They still tease each other and make us laugh but that's just a sibling thing.Wilona Woods really gets her chance to shine as the new lead actress of the series. She takes Janet Jackson's character Penny under her wing as we discover Penny's home is nowhere for a child to be living.The writers really did a good job at recapturing the mood of Good Times as it was in the first season even without the lead actors it began with.
3,"See you later Miss Rolle,Hello Miss Janet","This is the season of Good Times where the mainstream veiwers were tapering off, and left with only the hard-core(i.e. African-American) fans.Not only was John Amos killed off long ago(while getting acclaim for his portrayal of adult Kunte Kinte in Roots),but Esther Rolle departed the show due to the direction the show has taken.By the fall of 1977,the fifth season was re-tooled with not only Ja'net Dubois taking center stage, but gaining a new daughter in the form of Penny Gordon (Janet Jackson) an abused child who was abandoned by her mother.Although the Evans' parents were gone, the hub of activity was still the Evans apartment as the children were left to fend for themselves under the watchful eye of Willona.The new retooling of the show displayed the drama of backstage politics manifest itself into the show that was itself self destructing."
3,History of marlborough Tavern with recipies,I helped write this bookGood recipies from my MomVery small with stapled bindingProbably worth $10.00
3,An OK Belt,"The fact that there is padding between the stitched leather at the back of the belt means it is not legal for powerlifting competition (in the organization I lift in). For general lifting though, it's pretty good - but not the best I've ever used. If I were to buy a belt again, I'd buy one that is 4"" wide all the way around."
3,Sturdy construction,"I replaced my other belt because I ran out of belt notches. This is an OK belt but I sure wouldn't call it padded. My first few uses found it to be really sharp at the edges so I razor bladed the corners and now the round corners no longer dig into my skin. The buckle is great but would like the back to be 6 inches to cover more area. For the price, it is still a good deal. Fast shipping."
1,Shipped the wrong product,"I ordered this product last week before travelling to NYC. The unit arrived on time but in a very large box.The receipt says size Medium but when I got home (Jamaica, the country) the belt is size Large. It seem like a good sturdy product but unfortunately when its too big it is useless. I am very disappointed with the end result and I don't seem to have a way to mail the supplier. I would not recommend them."
3,Quality is Hit or Miss!,"I have purchased three (3) of these belts within the past 12 months. Two of them are great, while the third has cracked leather after only a few weeks of use. If you are lucky enough to receive the ones that stay intact, you will enjoy the belt as it is supportive and comfortable. If the leather on your belt cracks, you will have to deal with the hassle of organizing a return."
5,Valeo Lifting Belt,"This Valeo 4"" padded leather belt is nice. It's a little robust, but I liked it. Gets the job done, and I would purchase it again. The price is great too, it's a great deal."
2,cheap belt,"Cheap leather and not enough padding, complete with a large made in Pakistan sticker. I recommend spending the extra money on the schiek 2004 4 3/4 inch leather belt."
5,fussi ole',"besides wir sind helden sportfreunde stiller are my fav german band!you have to win zweikampf kinda got the soundtrack of the fifa soccer worldcup 2006 in germany...i absolutly love 54,74,90,2006 (since we didn't got the cup this year there's allready a new song... 54, 74, 90, 2010) and die frisur von bjoern borg, as well as all the songs from this cd...a ABSOLUT must have, if you love soccerand a ABSOLUT must have, if you love the sportis"
4,Calphalon Nylon Whisk,"This is not a bad whisk, but I also use it for other purposes, such as lifting boiled eggs or steamed veggies out of the pan. It is quite useful when making gravy while you have food such as meatballs in the pan; you can get right in and under them when stirring without breaking them in the process."
5,Amazing !,"I play the guitar , but will never get anywhere near this man's ability .A number of different styles are featured and it is great driving music for the open road .A great band backs Johnny up and you can hear they had a good time making this record .It can be a bit much to take in one sitting and I recommend you come back to it as you see fit ."
2,Too Short.,"It seems like they didn't really want to sell this as the actual ""best of show"" rather it is more of a sampler so that you buy the full DVD of each year that you liked the most.I was waiting for the whole Bill Stewart Trio show with Larry Goldings and Peter Bernstein, but they only put Jive Coffee in here.Instead of buying this either get the Modern drummer festival 2003 DVD or just visit moderndrummer.com and checkout bill stewart's page.Besides that well, the Antonio Sanchez clip is the only one i actually considered useful(from MD Fest 2000 i think). The rest kinda sucked in my opinion. It had too many rock drummers and percussion players but not enough Jazz or Latin drumming."
3,Cheesey,"This is the cheesiest CD I have. This may be biased because I'm a very big metalhead, but I couldn't get off it. LaVey doesn't so much sing, as does speak the vocal lines; he should've stuck to writing. Nick Bougas and Blanche can sing, but again because of my taste in metal I couldn't get off on it. This is a pretty bland album, but still is a must-have for those interested in LaVey."
4,"Anita's still got it, and sharing it with us.","If you want a Christmas cd that is soulfull, sexy, fun and respectful all rolled into one, buy this cd.Anita sounds great, the arrangements are wonderful and fresh, and, in my opinion, so much better than Diana Krall's first attempt at a Christmas album.Buy and enjoy!"
5,The BEST ever,"This has been one of Anita Baker's finest cds ever!! Her voice is smooth and sexy. She has taken old Christmas songs and given them one of the best makeovers that I have seen in my 18 years! Young or old,wether your a fan or not,you will enjoy Anita at her best!!"
2,Christmas Nightmare,"Wasn't feeling this record, too jazzy and sassy for Xmas time. Plus, the worst album cover I've ever seen. Anita looks pissed off, quite frankly, like someone insulted her or something. Doesn't put me in a festive mood, that's for sure."
5,Anita Baker Does It Again!!!!!!,This CD is a must have!Go out and solicit Christmas Fantasy TODAY!I am still stuck on Christmas Fantasy and Moonlight Sleighride Thanks Anita for giving your fans a variety.........
3,Hits and misses,"Hits: If you like jazz and Anita Baker, you'll like this CD. Her take on ""My Favorite Things"" is a perfect funky-jazzy Anita Baker song, and is by far MY favorite, with God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen right behind it.Misses: My biggest disappointment with this CD is that it is so short. I was really hoping for more songs. And after I skipped passed the songs I didn't like (Frosty's Rag and Family of Man) it was even shorter.I noticed a lot of people commented on the cover....not sure how or why that has anything to do with the quality of the CD, especially if you are downloading it from Amazon and loading it into an MP3."
2,Pretty but Limited,"Although the book is filled with very nice and informative pictures, it is nevertheless quite limited. I needed to relocate a toilet in a renovation project. Advanced enough, right? Well this book was useless. There was no information on venting requirments. If you like learning-by-example, this book may be for you, but only if the examples match what you need to do."
3,Good choice if you don't know anything about e-selling,"If you don't know anything about setting up a virtual store, this book will show you the basics. But be carefull ! It's quite out of date, and much of the info you'll find in it is obsolete"
4,Cheaper elsewhere,"Great hat, bought it for my husband, I bought it knowing that the skull didnt line up with the middle, the offcenter looks great. Only problem was that after a lot of wear and tear, about 3 years, the seams along the brim of the hat separated, exposing the inside of the brim. Still a great hat over all. I found it cheaper at the band-tees website."
2,Twelve Savage Female Felons,"I have fond memories of browsing thru mom & pop video stores as a kid during the 80's and running into all kinds of interesting, weird, titillating video covers from some of the most obscure movies released sometime during the 60's, 70's, or 80's. Usually the horror, action, or misc sections had the ""good"" stuff.Mankillers, released in 1987, no doubt belongs on one of those shelves along with all the other wonderful miscreants and varmints that were unleashed upon the public during the heyday of VHS. This movie is like a timecapsule of bad 80's clothing, hairstyle, and acting; that alone makes this movie worth a look.In the first 5 minutes alone, roughly ten people are gunned down. There are kidnapped 80's ""valley girls"" and savage ""death row"" fem felons acting like Junior High brats being recruited for a top secret mission. One of the prison girls is a former Glow girl, Tara of the Southern Belles. No real story, bad acting and a fun/silly trip down 80's VHS memory lane."
5,Nice looking clock,"This is a nice looking clock, and it seems to be fairly sturdy and heavy. (Before this, I had a cheaper plastic one that fell on the floor and stopped working.)It has a nice feature that I don't think was mentioned in the description on the webpage. The alarm is a progressive alarm - it starts out with a softer beep and gradually becomes louder. The pace of the beep also speeds up."
2,Could have been great,"This is a beautiful clock and I was excited when I got it, but I ran into some problems very early. First the glowing hands only glow for about 30 minutes so most of the night you can't see the time. Second the clock has a very loud tick. It is loud enough that it is hard to go to sleep with it on the nightstand. The Third issue is the alarm. It is very loud for an ascending alarm. I am a light sleeper and don't need to be shocked awake. I bought the clock because reviewers said it was very soft. This is not true. This clock really could have been great with some small changes."
1,can not be used as an alarm clock.,"This clock looks nice. The alarm can not be set accurately, so it can not be used as an alarm clock."
2,dessert spoons,"My fault, I could see they were long handled and didn't think they would be ice cream spoons. I wanted real dessert spoons so they are not what I wanted; However,.... we do use them to dig into deep jars!"
4,Remember When...,"If you are considering buying a Bruce Brown film other than The Endless Summer or Endless Summer II, this is a great place to start. Think of it as a ""Greatest Hits"" of his Golden Age of Surf Collection. You get a taste of each of the previous films and a chance to feel what surfing was really like in the 50's & 60's. No Frankie & Annette here - Just a group of guys having fun and inadvertently pioneering a new sport. Be sure to catch the cameos of then unknown names that are now surf legends. Enjoy! - and then get the rest...(but get ""Surf Crazy"" next!)"
2,"Darkly funny, yes. Radical? Hell no.","The Scum Manifesto divides its readers in a truly amazing way: according to who you read, it's either a classic wind-up lesbian farce (like Hothead Paisan) or it's incomprehensible hate speech. You can get it on the web for free, last time I checked, so you need not shell out cash to AK Press to find out what the commotion is about. What you will find is that it is a conservative's dream: feminism revealed as a man-hating conspiracy of idiotic slogan-shouting lesbians, scenarios lurid and laughable but extremely dangerous... and nothing more.The people running AK Press (the publisher) and Chris Kraus (who glowingly reviews this book on this site) are anarchists whose opinions I generally respect, and it completely baffles me that they see this work as thoughtful or radical in any way. Solanas is just another fundamentalist ready to inflict ""collateral damage"" for her cause. Don't pay money for it."
1,A Crazy Book by a Crazy Woman,"Valerie Solanas is best known becuase of her attempted assination of Andy Warhol. This book shows us why, though relativly brief, it allows us to peek inside of the scrambled mind of this woman. The book reads like a semi-connected series of ramblings, about how men are SCUM, and how a Utopia would be created should all the men be done away with. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Warhol history, or a good laugh, otherwise AVOID THIS BOOK!"
5,Brilliant,"There's a perspective on men that only women who've worked in the sex industry can truly grasp. It's us who see men as they truly are- not trying to impress a boss, not trying to land a wife, but when they are free to express who they truly are. And it isn't pretty. Valerie saw this and Valerie shouted back.A lot of people may not get this or think it extreme or ""crazy"". But there are women who will, and to us it's a breath of fresh air.Revolutionary."
4,Look closer,"First off, Val was not deranged..she was hyperintelligent and an intense counterculturist. This aggresiveness oughtta be refreshing to those used to passive whitewashed politicos of now or yesteryear. her bright, blunt viewpoints had to be intentionally chalked with shock-value (i.e implying genocide, fanatic feminism) in order to motivate a slacker society. Before buying this, i suggest you watch I SHOT ANDY WARHOL. Her personality and most importantly, her bio prior to all this, is explained."
1,Worthless...,"This is probably one of the worst pieces of writing ever. She outlines her so called beliefs, which are based on nothing. Her expierances definitely had an influence on forming her opinions on men, which lead to her ideas of hate and violence. There is absoultely no substance to her. Obviously, she is a woman with a weak mind that was never able to over come the way her life turned out. She is a wanna-be star that never made anything of herself in life. Her envy of Andy was the reason she shot him. She probably assumed shooting Andy Warhol would bring her some fame. She wanted someone to blame for her complete failures in life so she choose men to blame. I believe in reading everyones view and trying to understand where they are coming from, but this woman was obviously unstable."
3,wheels,"Wheels are nice, however not the correct size. When looking for wheels other companies described that they were for longboards, this description only gave wheel sizes. Would have been nice to have ""longboard wheels"" somewhere so that those of us who don't know much about skateboard wheels, and are getting them for our kids, are aware of what kind of board they are for."
4,complements the clock,"I wanted to keep my desk clutter free as possible so I this hanging picture frame works beautifully. And next my Umbra hanging wall clock, they add a little flair to my otherwise mundane office cubicle."
2,So disappointed...,"I've been looking for some unique frames for a spare bedroom of mine, and I was excited to see how this would look with some new beach photos I took. When I received the item, the glass of one of the frames was shattered and broken along the entire length. I really expected better. I did not try to send the item back, so I cannot comment on the service I was offered - I can only say I was so disappointed to receive this item in such awful condition."
3,mostly in French,Just beware that most of his singing is in French. His voice is incredible but you will not be able to know what he is saying unless you speak French.
3,Just the basics,"I'm kinda over getting jerseys with names and numbers on the back, especially the way A's players move around. If the price is right this is a good serviceable item."
4,Years of Enjoyment,"I've owned this on cassette since its release, and its played many times during the holiday season. It nice to have it on CD."
4,"Good, but not quite great Altman","I certainly liked this film, especially after a 2nd viewing. But it's weak spots kept me from feeling it's one of Altman's very best.There are some less than great performances in key roles -- some actors are miscast, or playing caricatures, or are just notthat brilliant. Some story lines seem facile, and the ending feels unsatisfyingly convenient and cute.Still, there's a lot that's funny, and a lot that's moving. It just never quite has the depth, or power or overall vision of it's earlier multi-character epic cousin, 'Nashville'.That said, most critics and people seemed to like it even more than me, and it's well worth seeing and deciding for yourself."
4,so what did you expect,"This is a solid, if silly, B movie. Yes, from a biological standpoint its absurd. Sure, the plot is silly. OK, the acting is indifferent. If, as I do, you like creature features with oversized animals, in this case mosquitoes, and don't mind the things I mentioned above, go for it. Don't expect to be impressed, but expect to be entertained."
3,Skeeter,"A fun little movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. I would have like to see more skeeters, but overall not a bad job."
3,typical giant bugs,This is an OK movie for giant bug watchers. I collect movies like this and was glad to find it. I enjoyed it. It is a typical giant bug movie.
1,Truely a benchmark movie,"If you are into bad B movies then Skeeter is among the benchmark movies you can use to rate all others. Use expressions like ""it ain't no skeeter"" when you find one worse. If you happen to be 14-16 years old and are using a VHS camcorder to make your first movie, you can learn a lot about what works and what doesn't. If your home movie turns out to be skeeter then you may just have a career in making trailers."
3,Pretty Good Set Hit&Miss,"this Isley Brother Album was alright but reflected the Sound&Vibe of the times.this Album doesn't match there 70's work or ""Mission to Please"".Ronald Isley got His Groove back as Mr.Biggs&thank goodness because while He sounded really well on this Set alot of the material here had the Isley's headed toward a fast dive.the title track&Ronald Isley's vocals save this Album."
5,T-Neck Style,"There are some artists whose contributions to R&B that will forever be immortalized. Enter this with the Isley Brothers. They have been a mainstay in the business for several years with Ronald Isley at the helm of their soulful dynamic. Though through the years after the loss of their brothers Marvin & O'Kelly, then Rudolph to pursue a calling as an ordained minister, the Isleys are still a very vital part of the R&B community & still remains as necessary as the day that that they went from a 3 piece outfit to 6; which the album 3+3 was appropriately named. The merging of the older brothers with the younger brothers with cousin Chris Jasper.Still one of my most important artists of all time. No music collection should be without their timeless classics. This album changed the sound of R&B music as a whole, b/w Angela Winbush's keyboard genius and arrangements, this CD was way ahead of its time."
3,not as seen in ad,"I specifically purchased this item because it not only was a button hook but had a ""teacup"" hook on the opposite end for pulling up zippers.The hooks I received did not have this feature which was a big disappointment."
1,Not up to the job it was designed for,"All the button hooks I've tried use wire that is too small in gage and is too soft. After trying to button my pants a few times, the wire looks like spaghettiButton Hooks Large Deluxe"
1,Awful - holes too big to be any good,"I wanted something to handle small lids of jars, plastic food containers, etc. However, the gaps at the bottom half of this are almost 2 1/2 inches long!, way more than big enough for many things to slip right through. Most frustrating (to me) is that by adding ONE MORE WIRE around the case, they could have made this a very useful product. No idea what the manufacturers of this were thinking besides keeping material costs down; the design of this is useless. As most of the cost of this item was shipping, no point returning. Waste of time & money. I'm still hunting for something that will do what I need."
1,Sad.....,the white covering cracked and the metal form has rusted and caused the white to crack even more....this was upon the first time i used it....will be returning....
2,I Rust my Case!,"We've had the mini dishwasher basket only a couple of months, and it's already begun to rust at the closure. This is a disappointment because the basket we bought it to replace lasted several years. I had looked all over for this item (a large local retailer had told me that it was out of production and no longer available). I was glad to finally find it online. However, the quality leaves much to be desired."
4,very good sweetner,"This sweetner is courser than the xylitol I bought from a health food store, but much cheaper also. It has some lumps, but I think it is still a good quality sweetner. I actually like the courser granules. I use it in my low glycemic cooking. It can be substituted teaspoon per teaspoon for sugar."
3,Well...,"No instructions or serving suggestions - I had to experiment to find out that it's pretty much spoon for spoon or cup for cup like sugar. It's not as sweet a taste as sugar and isn't as good as stevia, but it's okay."
2,xylitol Crystals,I would probably like it if it had arrived yet but it hasn't so ask me again later. I'm ordering from another vendor since I'm out so I'll let you know how I feel about that one.
5,A++++,"Simple effective! Get one for each car, like I did.Great if you need to be pulled out of the snow, etc."
3,Not quite what I ordered,"It was nice to find a quality tow strap, as Keeper's products are, without clips on the hooks. Sure, clips can be good if using tow straps for their intended purpose, but my purchase was for lifting things with a tractor bucket - sometimes chains aren't a feasible option.Well, my tow straps showed up quickly in one package(but if memory serves me, each had the rather high shipping charge added). However, what I got was not the pictured straps, but rather ones with clips. Darn it.Now I'll have to remove the clips to make them fully useful for my purpose - all while the seller probably thought it did me a favor by sending straps which likely cost more than the ones I wanted."
1,"strap good, hooks bad","A tow strap is better than a rope or chain for most recovery operations. But those metal hooks give me the heebie-jeebies. Keeper makes a very good tow strap, but this isn't the one. The one I use has strong, sewn-in loops instead of those metal hooks. I attach it to the stuck vehicle and my truck with shackles that can't come loose and fly around like cannonballs. Plus it's made of nylon, which stretches to absorb shock and can be used for kinetic recoveries. This is better than nothing, but not the best choice."
2,Qualifications?,"The book was ok...very redundant in parts. My real gripe. What exactly is the authors expertise? Is she a legal expert? Is she a psychologist/psychiatrist? She criticizes the legal system and the pschological system a lot in the book. Maybe rightly, maybe not.Gitta asks good questions about the legal/psychological systems, but I don't see her qualifications to make evaluations or critiques of either. If she got answers/ideas from legal/psychological experts that should be noted. There is nothing to indicate she has any of these qualifications...she just ""feels"" this way! That in itself diminishes the legitamacy of the ""story""."
2,Unreadable Cries,"Without a doubt, the most disjointed, poorly written narrative I've yet to read. Both the author and the subject constantly jump from one issue to another...the result is a jumbled mish-mash attempt at conveying the story."
4,Familiar with english childhood,"Having been born and raised in England for the first 21 one years of my life,I can understand the sort of childhoods that some kids go through.The English way of life is far different than any I've known so it was a very easy book to get into.I have read different snippets about this story over the years and I am pleased to see that finally someone has put all the facts together and writen an excellent account of these little killers.Well written,an interesting story.Not to be missed!"
3,Is Mary Bell Really the killer?,"I have never been truly convinced Mary Bell was the killer. Consider that the two tiny boys were allowed to roam freely, wherever they wanted to go (condemmed buildings too) without ANY supervision.The DNA evidence at the time was minimal,fibers from Mary's clothing, which could simply had been from playing. The book alludes to the workers that gave Martin cookies. I've always wondered if the work men or an older child could possibly have been the killers with a sexual motive.A killer could have staged the scene. Who knows really how a 10 year old girl with a troubled home life would act under the circumstances of little playmates being found dead? Her inappropriate laughing at the time is one thing that made her a suspect, but it could simply have been a sign of bravado or nerves,Mary's confession she possibly could have made up after her confession blaming Norma didn't fly.The book doesn't explore this."
3,Cries Unheard: Why children kill: The Story of Mary Bell.,"The writer kept the most important information till the end, I guess it is her style in order to keep the audience interested in the book. The only negative on the book is the printing date of 1999; I did not check the date before ordering. I like current information, not disregarding the suffering this; little girl to young woman endured."
1,not worth it,"I preview this book for my son. Before offering it to him as a resource, I thought in his best interest to do some research on the content and the author...Don't waste your money..."
4,"Form fitting,heavy duty,","But designed to work with carpeted floors.I have an older F-150 with rubber floor coverings.As a result, the mats slide around a bit...The little spikes having little of their intended effect.May need to look into a velcro attachment fix."
5,AC Motor,"This product was sent promptly and at a reasonable price. I had to return it , because it was the wrong motor, but the company that handled it refunded my money and worked me very well. Thank you Amazon for having such amazing sellers on your site. And thank you CHS"
5,Freizeit Revue,My parents are from Germany so I ordered this as a Christmas gift and they love it. It keeps them up to date on all the German (and American) celebs!
4,a book that will get you thinking straight,I think that this book is a very in sightful book becuase while i was reading it. It made me think about what i could do to change some little things in my life that i wasnt satisfied with. Like my behavior towards my parents and family members.It also made me think about how i was treating myself and others with such disrespect. Another thing i taught me was to lave me for who i am and not for who everyone else wants me to be.See i think that it made me think these ways becuase i took the time to read deeply into the book and try to look into the deeper meaning of what they were reallly trying to tell us (girls the ages of 12 or older). i also think that i feel this way becuase iam a chatholic and belive that what god gave you was given to you for a purpose nto becuase he wants to punich you but becuase he wants to make you unique. another thing is that this book takes you to the next level with cofidence and the next level with god.
4,A Must-Have for LaVey Fans!,"The best part of the CD is the track not listed, some 2minutes after the Battle Hymn of the Apocalypse. It is a powerfulinstrumental that evokes images of a military parade in Hell (at least for me). The readings of the Book of Satan by LaVey are nice, but better is the Hymn to Satan that opens and closes the ritual portions of the album and the reading of the Enochian Keys. The liner notes on the album are also interesting. Definitely worth having."
4,An old bit of fun.,"Considering this was made in the 60s and 70s, and also that it introduced a lot of closed minded people to ""something else"", it's really quite nifty. Consider it a little bit of fun, and something a bit left field. You won't find anything seriously ""occult"" or ""Satanic"" here.. but rather a bit of in-your-face attitude coupled with some rather unique invocations and musical tracks."
4,Pretty good board...,"This is a seven foot long foam softtop board. good flotation, and pretty solid. good price, especially with free shipping. i might suggest getting the longer version if your a beginner, but its pretty good if your looking to get into surfing. dont forget to get a leash to strap onto the board."
5,a huge help for one new to gardening,Being pretty new to perennials but having read many books I was having sort of a writers block when it came to WHAT to put in my new garden.I knew all about HOW but with so many choices I was overwhelmed!This book has a good number of templates to give you a jump start and many outstanding photos of combinations of flowers that work together. In fact this has some of the best photos I have ever seen in a garden book.It also covers difficult situations like what works in Heavy Clay and wet sites an so forth.My plan was a butterfly garden and they had the perfect template for a 12x8 garden.Excellent book for beginners or people that are looking for new combinations!! My fav book so far. (out of the 30 I have looked at).
4,Lots of good ideas,"This book does not give info on the actual plants. It's more a suggestion of plant combinations involving complimentary colors, plants needs, etc. Gives great inspiration for things that would work in your own garden setting."
2,contents not as titled,This boook has good ideas for the combination of campatible plants according to lighting and soil condition. Biggest disadvantage is that they are not all perienals but rather part are perienial other are annuls that drop their own seends in the fall and then reseed in the spring of the following year. Does not approach the problems of the seeds and how far they may spread.I would prefer a book that has all compatable perienials listed rather than the self seeding annuals included as a perienial.
2,No Juice,"This book was (is) a big disappointment, containing as it does nothing new regarding perennnial combining that isn't covered in at least a dozen or more recent and more interesting books, not to mention the classics. This is perennial combining 202 with no spark of imagination in the pairings that can make a garden jump for joy. The photography is so ordinary and the color is extremly garish. Is that due to the Digital Imaging Specialists Dale Mack and Jane Ramsey or what? I can find no photographic credits (except for the cover) which is probably just as well. Obviously in a book this size (351 pages), from someone who is as accomplished as Mr. Burrell, there is useful information to be gleaned but I already have books that serve that purpose. If I had seen this in a book store, having thumbed through it for a few moments, I would never have bought it. However, if you are just beginning your library of perennial books this one may be useful to you."
3,"beautiful combos, but hard to get plants","I like the ideas and designs in this book very well. I made a list of plants that would solve some of the issues in my garden, and tried to find them online from the nursery list in the book --and later from Google. It proved nearly impossible to get even half of them from the same nursery, which really spikes the freight bills. If money weren't an object, I'd be all over this book. But my flower garden is a lot bigger than my budget! I did finally find a nursery from his list (Bluestone Perennials) which had enough of them to make an order worthwhile.In short, it's a beautiful book, but either be very flexible in your plant selections, or bite the bullet and spend a bunch of money hunting down the plants listed in the book."
5,An amazing reference guide for landscape design,"If you've ever drooled over perfectly arranged landscapes designed with fabulous color combinations, texture, and an array of plants all sizes and shapes who's colors are pleasing to the eye, this book is your tool. There are many garden companies that offer pre-designed gardens, but they're expensive and sometimes have plants that you just don't care for. This book gives you ideas, plans, tips on how to combine plants in such a way that it looks like a professional landscaper came and did all the work. Every design is wonderful, the photography is superb and the gardens are beautiful. A real asset for anyone who wants to have a beautiful garden without paying a designer/landscaper to do it for you. A great book."
3,no title,"Good color. Didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. In that sense,it was disappointing. I haad hoped for more from Burrell"
5,Something for Everyone!,"I usually am hesitant to buy these types of books - because I live in a colder climate (zone 3-4) there are usually not many combinations, styles, etc. to choose from out of an ""all inclusive"" book. Not the case here! There were plenty of plans and ideas for all zones and everything was very comprehensive in drawings and text. Just within the first few minutes of looking at it I had several ideas for my yard. What's also nice is that it covers everything from small spaces that need just a few plants to fill in to large areas that need coverage. I will definately be referring to this book AND sharing this book for a long time to come!"
3,Average mixed bag,"If this obscure band aims for any particular listening audience it is difficult to tell from this album. Some of the songs on this offering can best be compared to light pop music, while others are angled more toward light Latino pop. What results is an indistinctive album that will likely be lost in the back of used CD stores across America.While its music is not marred by obvious errors, this [apparently]5-person band of unknown roots also seems to lack the fire and punch that would give them breakthrough energy to be really successful. This is what mediocre sound like."
4,Good Album,"As someone who's gotten into Porcupine Tree starting from their later material, I've been delving into their earlier work. It's great stuff, but for my tastes I think the later stuff is better and more unique. Sky Moves Sideways uses a lot more synth in the forefront than their newer work, and is a lot less song driven. Personally I thinkFear of a Blank Planetis their finest work to date- it's got a wider dynamic and emotional range, better sounding instruments, the genius of Gavin Harrison on drums, and the epic masterpiece ""Anesthetize"". Sky Moves Sideways is a great album, but just doesn't reach the heights that they've hit since then. Still, a good listen."
4,Fascinating Portraits of Notable Northern Characters,"Pierre Berton an accomplished and beloved Canadian author presents here five essays on different notable characters that stand tall in the history of Canadian arctic discovery, exploration, exploitation and settlement. The author is a master of arctic history, legend and lore. His most notable works include Klondike Fever and The Arctic Grail. This effort is interesting but falls a bit short of the mastery and command that the author presented in his earlier efforts. It is notable that this work was completed in 2004 which was the last year of the author's life. It is still a worthwhile book to read for those interested in arctic history and the hardy colorful characters that accomplished early settlement and exploration of the extreme north. It is recommended that if you read this during the winter months sit close to your fireplace or woodstove."
5,Beloved childhood book,Our daughters still love the memories of bedtime with this book. Fun for them and fun for us to read to them. We have given it as gifts to many other children.
3,Easy To Use,"I've bought David Thompson's books on Thai Cooking. For me they are intimidating and do not make it approachable. Thai Cuisine distills Thai cooking to its most elemental. The tastes are true and authentic. One of the people I work with is of Thai descent (her Mom)and she told me that this was a book she knew and used. I have used it too along with ready made curry pastes that I also bought on Amazon. Don't be afraid, jump in!"
4,Tasty and truly easy,"This cookbook is full of flavorful and simple recipes. It includes a picture of every dish and all ingredients. If you are able to find fish sauce, oyster sauce, and curry paste, you'll be able to make the majority of recipes. Fish sauce and oyster sauce are fat free too, so for those on a low-fat diet, here are some exotic alternatives. I've given copies of the book to two friends in two months. You'll overcome your fear of curry."
5,Thai cookbook,This is a WONDERFUL cookbook: Simple and delicious Thai recipes. Get it: you will not be disappointed!
2,Amazon stamp,"I recently purchased this ring, and I must say that it is nice. The only problem is that the words ""Amazon"" are engraved on the inside of the ring, so if you want to place your own engraving it will be tough. I emailed customer support, and there is no way to purchase a ring without the ""Amazon"" stamp."
1,McHales Navy Season one,"This was very misleading, I thought I was getting season one. It was only disc one, and I had gotten the first eight episodes of season one also. Now I have 2 movie discs of the same thing with and extra episode on one of them."
1,thin and not sized correct,"I purchased this by model number air cleaner I have , it is an 1"" short all the way around where it fits inside and much thinner than the orginal one I took out. I would not buy this product again."
2,Not like the original product.,"TwinLabs has gone through several metamorphoses over the many decades. The original product, touted by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw in their book ""Life Extension"" was outstanding. It would absorb IMMEDIATELY into your skin, It also consisted ONLY of Na-PCA - NOTHING ELSE. ""Improvements"" often are not, as in this case.WOW what a disappointment!"
1,Beware New Formula - Complete Failure,"TwinLab - Na-Pca W/Aloe Vera Non-Oily), 8 fl oz liquidMy wife and I have been using NaPCA w/ Aloe daily since 1987 until now. The new formulation is virtually worthless now that it has been watered down and has added irritating eucalyptus oil."
5,The greatest country Christmas album!,"The best country music Christmas CD I have ever heard. I have always been a fan of Randy Travis. During Christmas, this CD is continously being played on my stereo. I would recommend this album to anybody who likes Christmas music not just Randy Travis fans."
5,Ask Santa for this one,"This is a musical stocking stuffer that will become a part ofyour Christmas tradition.No frills. Just great songs, masterful arrangements, accomplishedmusicians and Randy's pure, clear baritone.One of the best renditions of Pretty Paper I have ever heard."
5,Great Music,"Bought this for a christmas gift for my son in law and he was so happy, the condition was excellent, it arrived sooner than promised and everything was perfect, thanks for everything, I well use Goodwill anytime they provide a product I need."
4,A Wonderfull Collection of Classic and Original Christmas Songs,"Randy Travis lends his smooth voice to this collection of original ""Old Time Christmas,"" ""A White Christmas Makes me Blue,"" and classic Christmas carols. It makes a great CD for those cold December days wrapping presents. The CD is on the short side, but you like what you hear."
3,Pure Country Christmas,"This CD is COUNTRY all the way, so if you don't like twang, don't go near this. I'm sure you all know what Randy Travis sounds like, and know whether you like the idea of a hard country sounding holiday CD.The two best cuts on this CD are Winter Wonderland and a perky, happy song called Meet Me Under the Mistletoe. He does a good, but unspectacular, job on some Christmas standards. Old Time Christmas is nice enough.There are some clunkers on here. There are two my-woman-left-me-so-my-Christmas-is-blue songs, which leave me cold. He also does Willie Nelson's Pretty Paper, another country tearjerker. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like sad and miserable Christmas songs.I recommend this CD only to fans who like their music really country. Even then, I'd say many people will prefer something like Ricky Van Shelton Sings Christmas, which is country without the crying in your Christmas beer selections."
5,Wonderful,This was an amazing book!!!! you neever knew what would happen next!!! You could really understand Maggies feelings and I somewhat related to them I could really feel for her as if she were a real person!! I felt all of her feelings! I could not put this book down!recommended age.. 8-14
5,behind the attic wall,"I read this book originally in elementary school, and for years couldnt remember the name. Luckily I found a nice woman who knew i was trying to find this book, and i was able to get a copy. After several years of not having read this book, and being in my early twenties, i now realize the connection between maggie and mary lennox from the secret garden. There is so much of a connection there even maggie herself states it in Behind The Attic Wall. If you have never read this book, and LOVE the secret garden you will also love this book."
5,"A great ""doll-tale""!",This book was one of my favorites that I've ever read. It was very intriguing. It's one of those book where on a day when you have nothing to do you read Behind The Attic Wall again. Maggie is a normal girl until she finds her own mystical world with dolls. I loved this book. A definitate all-time classic fairy tale.
4,"Review for ""Behind the Attic Wall""","This is one of my all-time favorite books. I first read this book when I was in the 2nd grade. For my age, it was just the right kind of book: a story about friendship but with just enough suspense to keep me interested. I am now in the 10th grade and I recently reread the book. For a while, when I was younger, I would sit by my dolls and wonder if they could really talk. That is how captivated I was. I would definetly recommend this book to any child seeking a thrilling novel that isn't too scary or time-consuming to read. I believe it has the right themes and morals built in for any aged reader. This book is a good example of a unique one-of-a-kind read. Ever since I last read this, I realized that everything you write doesn't have to be within just one genre and that suspenseful novels can be about little girls playing with dolls."
3,"A Great Book, but...","I think that the main story was great, but I was left with many questions. Why would these people become dolls? Was Uncle Morris also called as Maggie was? Is that why he also became a doll? Will Maggie also become one? What did the dolls and Uncle Morris mean when they said ""Your the right one, Maggie""? Maybe I'm not supposed to think those things, but I couldn't help it. Maybe some of these questions are answered in the book, I'll have to read it over. Otherwhise, it was beautiful."
5,"i read this so many times, I lost count.","Beautiful, thoughtful book. Explores class and loss and loneliness while celebrating imagination and wonder. I have no idea how this book hasn't been reissued or how it failed to win a Newbery. Wise beyond it's years, suitable for ages 8-100. Just very well-written."
4,A wonderful and magical story...,"I first read this book when I was about 9 or 10 -- I'm now going on 24. To this day, I still remember the fascination of reading this story, and the eerie picture on the cover. I found this book in a store just the other day, and had to re-buy it! From her uncertainty of meeting her GREAT-aunts... to the mystery and secrets of the dolls(and their garden)... and the magical ending... it is definately a wonderful book for children (and adults, too)."
5,At 30 years of age I remember reading it at 11!,I loved this book. I looked it up on Amazon just to see if it was still around. This book helped me fall in love with the magical world of reading.
5,Do You Dare to Look Behind the Attic Wall?,"Maggie is a troubled and unloved child. Shunted from boarding school to boarding school since the death of her parents, life begins to change for her when she's suddenly moved to the home of the great-aunts she did not know existed. The old ladies' strange ways baffle Maggie. Only very odd Uncle Morris seems interested in Maggie. Soon after arriving, Maggie begins hearing voices in the old house that no one else can hear. In her search for the source of the voices, Maggie finds a secret place and a way to regain the loving childhood and acceptance she so desperately needs.NOTE: This story is at once both fascinating and scary. Not for sensitive children."
2,NO HARMONIES!,"This book does provide a great concise history of the Mamas and the Papas and does have all 16 songs it claims, but if you are looking for the harmonies in the songs DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It only contains the melody and not a full instrumental section. This was a sore dissapointment for me because I already know all the melodies and their history. Beware: if you are looking for a REAL music book... this is not the one for you. If you are just starting out reading music or playing the piano, its a very concise book with 16 of their greatest songs."
3,seems to work well,"I did not notice the odors were anymore reduced.The dust does seem to be down.The machine has stoped working twice now, it becomes misaligned easily when moved. or when checking filters.It is not worth the big bucks."
3,Osculating,I do like this product but the osculating part of it quite working after 6 months . Any warranties available?
4,allergy sufferer,"Purchased this product to alleviate my allergies to dust and pet dander. Had it for a month now and notice a slight difference in air quality. The product does eliminate odors to a certain extent. Did notice there was less dust on the furniture after leaving it on for at least 12 hrs a day. Its very quiet even on medium speed (which is great because im a light sleeper). I also noticed I started to wake up with less congestion. Overall, would recommend this product."
4,3-in-1 Air Purifier,"PRO:Easy to clean the permanent washable pre-filter and HEPA filters.12 level cleaning speedUV Bulbs is quite easy to replaceCON:permanent washable pre-filter is irreplaceable even though on the user manual showed washable pre-filter (T.3024) suppose to be able to order through Kaz web site or call the toll-free number, which mean if you lost or damage the permanent pre-filter then you're stuck with using Odor-control pre-filter which is need to be replace with a new one every 3 months.it is not exactly whisper-quiet air purifier at least that only apply at the lowest cleaning level."
3,Okay for an air purifier,"The purifier is okay at best. Since it uses a hepa filter it can get somewhat loud, i notice not as much air goes in as much as an ifd air purifier. More things seem to go wrong with hepa also, as in odors can permanently stick on hepa filters. Mine actually stopped rotating/oscillating after about a year of use."
1,Rattling Sound,"Picked it up at Target. After two days it started making a vibrating sound while in oscillation mode. In another two days I couldn't position it so it would be quite, even on the slowest setting. Poor build quality and loose plastic parts caused it to make the sound. Returned it. Now looking for a better build quality HEPA filter. Wish db ratings were given to make the selection easier. Seems most HEPA units will do the job of cleaning the air sufficiently, but the sound level and build quality matters. Reading the reviews the Winix 9000 or 5300 units seems like a reasonable gamble. Although the 5300 isn't listed on the Winix web site, but is sold here and other places online. Not sure why."
1,Sooo Noisy!,"Really disappointed. It's not ""whisper quiet"" at all. After 6 months of use and regular cleaning, it became very loud, even at the lowest setting.I can get it replaced, but why would I want the same noisy appliance? I'm even more disappointed that the Honeywell customer service supervisor had nothing to offer as a solution other than replacing it.I can not recommend this product at all."
2,"You'll be dissapointed, too","I know how tempting it is to ignore the bad reviews when there are so many good ones. You may also think that surely a product that costs this much and made by such a well-known manufacturer can't be as they say, right? Well, believe it folks....this is definitely not worth the money. I'm certainly glad I did not pay anywhere NEAR the price it's selling for here. It is really loud on all but the lowest setting, and even then it's very noticeable (unlike the big, round, old hassock-style honeywell HEPA air purifiers, which were really quiet on low speed). As others have stated also, the motor eventually starts to make a little noise (not horrible, but definitely erodes one's confidence in the product). The oscillation feature can get noisy as well, and mine even stopped working for awhile. Doesn't even filter that well. Trust me, avoid this one."
2,"All the bells and whistles, no worky","I bought this purifier at Target because it was the most expensive one there so I figured it would work. After a week, it started making rattling noises on the low settings. The unit is very quiet but compared to other units I don't believe it moves very much air. It is cool looking but I doubt it's as functional as some of the other Honeywell Purifiers. The purifier also says HEPA clean, not true HEPA. So basically you're paying because the unit looks cool with nice lights. Don't buy it."
2,"Worked ok, but only for a couple of years",Purchased from Target and it worked ok but then we started running into problems. The first to go out was the UV lamp. Fortunately Target had them on clearance because they're fairly pricy. Then just recently everything seemed to die. No power to the display. I check everything the guide tells you too but no luck.
1,Worked great...for three days.,"This was given to me as a gift. It worked great for three days. Then I decided to move it into the bedroom. Turned it off, unplugged it, moved it to the bedroom, plugged it in....can NOT turn it on again. Have tried plugging it into every electrical outlet in the apartment--nada. The power light will blink a few times and then that's it. Called the company like the box instructed (specifically told to call if there are problems rather than returning the air cleaner to the store). Customer service was stumped after telling me to check to be sure the filters were in place, that the back grill was in place, and that I'd pushed the power button. She told me to bring it back to the store. Well, it was a gift, the store and the receipt are both over 500 miles away and this just sucks all around. Will never choose Honeywell again."
2,zd,it is not so bad. one thing i do not like it and that is that product it self create more small particles of dust. it is not as advertised.
2,not what i expected,i guess i should have read the reviews before buying this book. i thought it was a relationship book but when i got it i realized the entire book is about male circumcision. and the book was written by a woman. i read it all in one night because its very small. i found the concept interesting but i felt the author was a little extreme with her examples. i did get the point and it made me reconsider if i would give my own son circumcision. but this is definitely not the book i thought i was buying.
2,One of the worst circumcision books,"I am personally very interested in this topic, and have read over a dozen books on circumcision, and this is easily the worst of the books that come out against circumcision (almost as bad as the pro-circumcision books!). I find the book incredibly sexist and homophobic. It is almost entirely opinion based, with little in the way of facts. This is ridiculous because there is a lot of great factual information available, just do a web search. Even though I agree with quite a number of her claims (tho not all), I still can't stand the way she wrote them. There are much much better books on circumcision out there. ... Or well, just about any other circumcision book. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,"Spend more, get more","I ordered two of these brackets, and one was on backorder. For the one I did get, I didn't get all the parts, like the set screws, and the flash adapters it promised. The bracket is quite strong, but it has sharp edges and it's either loose, or tight as can be. It's not very user friendly. I'd suggest spending a few more dollars and get a good one."
4,Not bad for the price,"I've had two of these for about two years now (one being used in a hot wiring closet), and they seem to work fine.Yes, there is some serious stupidity with the management - the serial / CLI functions do very little. The web interface was designed by idiots (slow, cumbersome, and only works with IE). That being said, once it's configured it's not a bad piece of equipment."
1,Silly title for a Christmas album,"With Australia being south of the Equator, Christmas arrives at the beginning of Summer. It's time for the beach, not a ""Winter Wonderland.""I have no idea why a CD titled ""Christmas in Australia"" would feature ""White Christmas,"" ""Jingle Bells,"" ""Sleigh Ride"" and other winter-type songs for Australia's summertime Christmas. I have three volumes of Australian carols in my collection so I know they are available. This album by ""The Outback Singers"" could have been called ""Christmas in London"" and it would have made more sense."
3,incomplete kit,The kit needs to contain 3 bronze bushings. If your bushings are wore out and you don't replace them the gears will fail in no time at all.
2,"Good, if you don't overclock","Most Asian mobos (Abit, Gigabyte, MSI etc.) are great on paper, full of treats like noiseless cooling, only solid capacitors, dual Gigabit port etc..If you run a plain vanilla system, they'll be great for you.If you want to overclock, however, they'll make you cry.Asus Striker Extreme can't get beyond 380Mhz, no matter how much you fine tune your bios, fixing voltages and multipliers.On top of that, it costs more than great mobos like evga or BFG.If you want treats and need no overclocking, that maybe your board. If you care about serious performance, go for evga or BFG."
1,Too many bad reviews on other sites too!,"Buy EVGA, ASUS has too many problems with all their Nvidia chipset boards. SLI Club has alot of input about this! Best now to get the EVGA Nvidia 780i SLI A-1 FTW MoBo, excelent reviews and issue with 45nm is resolved, overclocks well above advertised!"
1,The author has rocks in his head!,"Some of the authors' explanations are very weak, even on some of the important points. As I read this book, I get the sinking feeling that the authors were in a hurry to get to press and thereby brushed over some topics simply because they did not take the time to address them properly. This book leaves me flat. Some of the input data in the sample problems is bad, making correct output impossible. It is clear that the authors have not run all the programs with their own sample data. At times, it's just pathetic."
2,Micro to Main SHAME,"I was not impressed with the book. To begin with, COBOL does not really exist anymore and finding support is near impossible. The book dropped the reader into the material as if the person had background knowledge of programming. I was so confused throughout the text. It was bad enough that my professor was frustrated and called off the programming assignments and we turned in written work (discussion type questions). If you possess a background in programming, then this book maybe for you. If you are a beginner, RUN!"
1,"I have the book, where's the solution manual?","I have read the book, and think that it presents good examples of the particular points in question. Having said that, where's the solution manual?"
1,this book was terrible,"If I were already a seasoned programmer, or had some type of backgound in the languages, this book would have been a good refresher. That not being the case I felt like i just gave my college bookstore my hard earned $80. This text lacks focus and never goes in depth with any specific topic. The tutorial gives you little instruction when creating a program for the first time. And being that most student who are beginner programmers learn by example, this book is a pathetic excuse for killing a tree. The chapters may not have been so bad if there were more detailed focus points as well as ""understandable"" exercises after each chapter. Books like these are a student's worst nightmare."
1,One word...,"Bad, this was a horrible book for cobol. Dose not give you enough information say on doing a date vaildation check. it wasn't very good. of course it didn't help that the professor wasn't that great either. (lol) any ways i didn't like it. it didn't really help me."
4,Excellent discussion of the problem of unbelief,"Although this book can be repetitive and hard to follow, overall it gives an excellent overview of the causes of unbelief. In fact, I learned more about the moral responsibilities of unbelievers and dissentors from the Catholic Church than I did about how I can be certain of the faith.The simple way to describe his argument is that many disagree with established truth because they don't like it, not because they have any basis for unbelief. Fr. Dubay describes unbelief as a matter of the will, not of the intellect.I recommend this book to any Catholic who has concerns about unbelievers."
4,Understanding Leviticus,The subtitle indicates a commentary for children. I find it helpful to read as an adult. I intend to give it to my daughter to use with her children.
5,Well worth buying,"My wife loves this, and gives it to all her friends (male & female) as a baby-shower gift. She found out that you can get it for less than $[...] if you buy it direct from Nancy. Contact via her myspace: [...]. You can email her and arrange it -- that way she gets the money for the music, instead of someone reselling a used copy!"
4,What is a teapot? What is a tea kettle?,"A teapot is a vessel used for brewing tea. Hot water is poured into it and a bag of tea or diffuser (in this case there is a ceramic one built in) is inserted and the tea is brewed. Then the tea is served from the tea pot. This is a teapot.A tea kettle is used for heating the water that will then be poured into the teapot for brewing or steeping. A tea kettle is made to be placed on a heat source and can also be used for brewing or steeping like a teapot. This is not a tea kettle. Le Creuset does make those however, and they are sold here on amazon.I rated this a four because it is attractive, matches my pots, and Le Creuset ceramic is durable."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I love Le Creuset. however, their stoneware has limited uses. You can't put this teapot on the stove and that fact is NOT clear. Beautiful color."
1,A Cursory Glance at a Dozen Famous TV Shows,"Don't buy this book! I was deceived and bought it, thinking it would be a great companion to Sixties classics like Gilligan, Get Smart, Andy Griffith, and the Munsters. It's not. It mentions all of these shows and more but doesn't do any of them justice. Most of these shows deserve books devoted solely to each of them; they certainly do not deserve this Round-Robin type approach. Let me give you one concrete example: the Gilligan's Island chapter spends practically as much space on the two actresses who followed Tina Louise as Ginger Grant in the sequels as it does on Tina Louise herself! Does that make any sense? If you think so, go ahead and order this book. You'll learn all about guest stars and bit players on a dozen classic TV shows...MUCH more than you want to know, I'm sure! The author doesn't seem to have any real sense of why these shows still mean so much to so many! Very disappointed."
3,"Nice, but not durable.","This action figure is nice for collecting and display, but it is not very durable, even with fairly light use. I recommend this product for collectors, or people setting up a Narnia display, but not necessarily for children who will be playing with it."
5,this book is an absolute joy.,i love the recipes but i'm also drawn to just flipping through the pages and enjoying the artwork. this is a well crafted and beautiful approach to food.
5,Great book!,"This book is very touching. I couldn't put the book down and cried several times from sadness but also joy! Among the healing that is portrayed, there are several underlying stories that are realistic but also very unkown to many people. I would reccommend this book definately!"
3,Paladin for president ! ! !,"I wish the Starz western channel would show some other TV cowboys. This is one of the best. Rifleman is good, Big Valley is ok, but ""Have gun, will travel"", ""Johnny Yuma"" and ""Wanted dead or alive"" were better, I thought. Paladin finds customers in need of a gun hand and with good counseling and a little very fast, acccurate shooting gets everything straightened out. These four stories were all worth watching. I particularly like the last one. He helps a man, J Scott Smart (radio's Matt Dillon) beat his alcoholism and convinces the wife to get off the poor guys back and quit nagging."
4,Clear bowl covers,"Clear bowl covers...these items have been in use for many years, but are hard to find in stores because covered plastic bowls have become popular. We still like to have these covers on hand to quickly seal a food item. Useful. They rinse clean, so easy to use over and over again."
2,Flimsy quality,"There are better quality covers available, as these are quite flimsy. Other covers I had could be rinsed and re-used. These are not sturdy enough for that, and definitely over-priced for their low quality."
1,Online-Edition Missing All Appendices,"Anyone contemplating buying the online-edition of this book should be forwarned: All the appendices, which constitute 77 pages of important reference material, have been left out of this edition. You can see what you're missing in the table of contents, but that's all you'll get to see. The physical book is 491 pages long, while the online-edition gives you only 414 pages.When I attempted to bring this to the attention of the Amazon customer support staff, I was informed that my message informing them of this technical error was itself lost due to another technical error.If I cannot have a refund, at least I can save my fellow customers from a frustrating experience."
2,sigh,"Rather than a textbook, it is more appropriate to call this a paper compilation. Most of the proofing or numbers are shoved into the appendixes."
5,works as advertised,I had a somewhat complicated application (not a concrete block foundation/crawl space) but was able to adapt the device to a different situation. I intend to order another one for a different house.
2,disappointed with the product,"I purchased it last August and put it onto the small window of my crawlspace. I had kept it on most of the time for a few months. The review on this product is excellent. However, I didn't find any noticeable change in humidity in my crawlspace. I turned it off and am now using a de-humidifier and it turns out to be much more effective."
2,Only lasted 5 months,"This unit worked great for 5 months, but now no longer works. Looks like the motor might have burned out. My crawl space has high humidity, so the fan constantly ran, but I expected it to last longer than 5 months.Bottom line...If you have a damp crawl space with much humidity, you might want to search for a more ""heavy duty"" fan."
1,May Give You A Laugh,"Long considered the joke of the international occult world, a couple of TOSsers have gotten together to write a book on their pick-and-choose philosophy.The Temple of Set - of which Webb and co. are members - are reknowned for such things as harassing ex-members of the cult, publishing names and addresses of ex-members, rumours of paedophilia, spreading lies about other organisations (especially the Church of Satan, Baldur, and the Order of Nine Angles), curses that don't work (including one supposedly sent to me, but they must of sent it to the wrong address as I'm still here), and writing long winded articles on the 'ethics' of Satanism.Have a read of this book - it'll give you a laugh."
1,Does not actually hold your hair in place.,"The product doesn't hold you hair in place, and it requires you to wash your hands about 4 times to get it off. I just went to put it in my hair for the second time today, because it didn't work the first time, and in the amount of time I spent to wash my hands (not even completely, my hands are still sticky), my hair has already fallen back into my face.Don't waste your money on this."
3,Need thr right kind of tile.,This toy has potential to be fun but it will not stick to our tub so its useless till I figure away to tie it up. So if you have a newer bathroom it will probably work fine but if you have a older bathroom I would look for something else.
3,Excellent product...,Worked out pretty good for me. Replaced two 6 outlet surge protector. Mounted under my computer desk. Now I have 2 extra outlets. Very happy with the product.Update 6/8/2012: We had thunderstorm past week and this powerstrip blewed my desktop. Contacted the customer support and they refused for any replacement that this product does not have any insurance and i should have bought something with insurance coverage. I have been using 2 cheap surge protectors and it withstood lots of power cuts and thunderstrom. This is really a neat product. with 15 outlets i am sure you will be connecting several thousands worth of electronics. so buyer BEWARE... I am off to replacing this surge protector now. changing my rating from 5 start to 3 star.
5,Great Product,"It is a great item, and the thing I am proud of even though it was a little more money, it is american made. Support the country you live in. I need a lot of extra plugs around Christmas time for my village, and it worked wonderfully, One switch too care of half my village. GREAT."
5,Childhood Classic,I love the fact that my children are now watching the shows that I loved as a child!! Thank you Amazon!!
3,Frosty good/ Frosty Returns is a stinker,"""Frosty the Snowman"" is a classic along with The Little Drummer Boy, Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.""Frosty Returns"" is an Eco-terrorist heist of Christmas. It talks about Winter Festivals, Fertility Goddesses, and evil Big Business. Not one word of Christmas, without which there is no point in the story.The environmental extremism ruins the story. Plus the songs are stinkers. You've never heard any of them on a Chrsitmas album, unless Green Peace has one....My suggestion is buy the DVD and figure out how to scratch out Frosty Returns so you won't get snow burned next year.I would pay twice the price to be able to buy the DVD WITHOUT Frosty Returns."
4,Original Frosty - A Classic...Frosty Returns - P.C. Garbage!,"The original ""Frosty the Snowman"" is an animated classic Christmas cartoon that every family should own. The voices of the great Jimmy Durante and Jackie Vernon only add to the charm of this short film. And with the classic cartoon voices of Paul Frees and June Foray, how can you not love ""Frosty the Snowman""?The problem with this DVD is that you have to buy the politically correct ""Frosty Returns"" along with it. ""Frosty Returns"" is an environmentalist, secularist propaganda short. The children are celebrating ""The Winter Carnival""...no mention WHATSOEVER of Christmas, or even the more P.C. standard ""holiday season"". Don't waste your time with the newer version, stick with the classic and Merry Christmas (it's not a crime to say it people!...not yet)"
3,FROSTY RETURNS MAKES ME WANNA PUKE!,"I REALLY LOVED THE ORIGINAL VERSION, BECAUSE IT HAD GOOD ANAMATION, AND THE QUALITY WAS GOOD. THAT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CARTOONS TO WATCH DURING CHRISTMAS VACATION.WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I BORROWED FROSTY RETURNS FROM BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO, AND I'M GLAD I RENTED IT. THE ANAMATION WAS SO BAD, AND THE KIDS FROM THE OLD FROSTY WEREN'T THERE. ***DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON FROSTY RETURNS!***"
1,Frosty,"The dvd came quickly, but it was not in the advertised case. It was the same dvd, but just not in the case advertised."
1,Frosty Returns reflects American youth attitude!,"I can't believe this movie. I'm watching it on TV right now after sending my son to take a bath! Thankfully I didn't waste my money buying this abomination. What happened to the genuinity of the Holidays and the innocence of childhood? Would a more loving cast of characters, like in the original Frosty, not 'sell' to todays children. Does poor behavior and lack of respect in todays youth need more negative influence? I think we need quite the opposite! Media like this is totally iresponsible and should NOT be supported by sales. They HAD to bundle the set, otherwise nobody would buy Frosty Returns...pathetic!"
2,Frosty the Snowman,"DVD contains two movies: the original Frosty the Snowman and a new movie I haven't seen on TV called Frosty Returns. The latter is not the one with Crystal, his wife which I assumed it was when I bought the DVD. It is a more modern version that I truthfully do not like content-wise for my 4 year old daughter. There are a lot more modern references and an attitude that I would have preferred she not be exposed to. Just my take. Wish they just had the original on the DVD or had the sequel they show on TV with Crystal instead of this new modern version."
3,"Classic Movie, But Questionable Content","This movie is definitely a classic, but I wonder if the fact that a little girl runs off with a strange talking snowman is the best message to send to kids."
1,Not what is says,It was ont the first frosty the snowman not both of them like it said and I still payed full price for it. Very disappointed
2,Frosty is missing....,"Aren't DVD releases great! All the memories without the inexcusible hatchet-job done by the broadcast media these days... NOT!!! What then is the excuse for this hatchet-job in the home video release? Four minutes of content is unaccountably missing, and the ""Frosty Returns"" bit is a poor substitute. Can we expect a reissue containing the real 26-minute ""original television classic""?? This has all the appeal of a big smile with a missing tooth. Perhaps we should make those responsible ""write 'I'm sorry for what I did to Frosty' a hundred zillion times""."
4,Frosty Returns Stinks!!,"Frosty the Snowman is a wonderful story! A classic! Frosty Returns was horribly disappointing! Other reviewers already mentioned the socio-political agenda which was obvious, but I would like to add that the music was BAD, BAD, BAD! Not only were they melodically boring, but the lyrics sounded like they were written by a 4 year old. The fact that the characters couldn't carry a tune in a bucket didn't help either! They could have at least found people who can sing!!!Buy it for Frosty... Chuck Frosty Returns in the garbage! Don't waste your time!"
4,I'd buy it again,"Very good sudsing action going on. Does not cause skin to become dry and itchy like most soaps. Never a nasty scum tub ring. The only thing I don't like about it is the price.update: I would not buy again. It is too weak. I finished a bottle of this, and did not feel clean after all that usage. I was still sweaty with body odors. Dr. Bronner's soap works better than this."
4,I've Been Using This For Years,"This soap is a longtime favorite of mine. I love the versatility of it: that it can be used for bathing, showering, washing hands, washing hair, washing pets, and washing babies. It has a pleasant smell and a little goes a long way. I couldn't give it 5 stars, because it's very difficult to incorporate the moisturizing cream, which separates and rises to the top of the bottle. Shaking the bottle doesn't get the job done. It wasn't until the bottles were 1/4 used that I could finally incorporate the cream into the soap by shaking the bottle."
4,good product if you can get it,"i like the product very much and if you review my order you will see that was my order...butwhen i opened my box, i got instead the lotion, which i'm not so fond of. i don't like to send things back so i'm stuck with it, but i really wanted my moisturizing soap!"
2,Wouldn't purchase again,It's overpriced for the amount/effectiveness. It's very very watery/oily so you will use it up immediately. I would not recommend this for acne. It didn't help me at all.
3,A collection of research papers,"This is a nice book if you are interested in knowing the basic of biodegradable plastics. The book is composed of edited version on several related research papers from all over the world. Most of these papers are outdated from 1980s and 1990s. Considering the content on the book, the price is a little bit costly. After all, you are buying an edited version of other people's work. If you do have time, you can find all those articles through popular database for free."
4,Rap classic,Big Daddy Kane does not get his just rewards. This rap music helped get it going. BDK was awesome back in the 80s and buying this on CD 20 years later brings back great memories of when rap was rap and not so much crap now. Get this one for a good rap history lesson. ENJOY!!
3,out to sea,"Generally well-done as far as arrangements, playing in tune. Good selection of numbers in the same genre. But I have serious trouble with the engineering - someone was leaning on the 'highs' and it drives me up the wall. I would have thought better of something I believe was made in Germany. (And unfortunately my car player isn't adjustable to bring out the lows.)"
4,Very good easy listening CD's,"Out of all my CD purchases these 3 are among the best.1. Beyond The Sea Frank Chacksfield2. Forever In Love Floyd Cramer3. 20 Years of Beautiful Music 101 StringsUsually there are 1 or 2 selections on a CD that you really like but all of the choices are good. Frank Chacksfield and 101 Strings have excellent orchestrations for each tune or melody. I have thorougly enjoyed them all as they are from the 60's, 70's and 80's."
1,Daisy is a Dud,"Dreadful. Poor quality DVD and excruciatingly bad ""dancing"" and I use the term ""dancing"" loosely as there is no real dancing at all. If you want to introduce your child to an appreciation of dance, I suggest you keep looking, as this DVD doesn't cut it."
1,Piece of junk,Very noisy at all speeds.It offers absolutely no noticeable improvement to air quality.Remote control is terrible and stops working after moderate use.
4,best watch i ever had,i like that u could set two different times when u travel alot it a plusnever take it off cause i tend to rest thing down and leave it there lol
3,Decent one for teenagers.. Though over priced for the features it offers..,A typical watch targeted for the teenagers.. No problem with product shipped by Amazon; but the image did make it look far better than it actually was.I guess that happens with all products on the net. :)
3,Very Difficult to Figure out the Settings,"I just gave this to my husband last night as a gift. He is normally a whiz at following directions, but I heard him in the next room struggling for half an hour, just to set the date and time. He loves the way it looks, maybe I'll post another review once he figures out how to set it."
3,G shock,Nice looking watch . The pic made the watch look bigger on line wouldn't have purchased because of size of the face .
4,"Great product, but smaller than i spected.","Great product, its solid, it work great for sport, it is smaller than I spected, but still love it, i heard with a bigger diameter some time it is painfull to make sport, but this have the perfect size for this."
4,My Fiancee Loved it,Beautiful watch nice and big enough for his wrist. Easy instructions to set up. The watch looks expensive and its worth every penny
3,Ditto.,"As a lot of other reviews said, the minute hand blocks a good bit of the digital part. The glow in the dark on the arms is very weak, even after having it in the sun all day. I have skinny wrists and the band does not allow much slack. I like the size of the face, perfect for people with small wrists. I will wear it for a couple years, just to get my moneys worth and then look for a new one. Don't get me wrong, its a good knock around watch if you don't want to damage a nice one you have yet still wear a decent looking watch."
2,Customer product review,"I was somewhat disappointed with the Casio G100-1BV Ana-Digi Watch. Aesthetically, it is not all that appealing, but performance-wise, it does it's job. Also, I would like if it had phosphorescent hands so that I could see time in dim lights or darkness. This will be my ""work watch"". Have had Casio product in the past, which is why I ordered this model."
5,perfect,I'm a firefighter who bought this watch to wear at work. I love it so much i never take it off. stylish enough to wear around all the time and tough enough to handle a fireman's duties. best watch I've ever owned.
4,"You're gonna like the way you look, I guarantee it.","For me, wearing a watch is 50% style, 50% timekeeping. Let me tell you, this thing looks good. The design is very sleek and not nearly as big as it may be depicted from the pictures. It's also very lightweight and feels good on the wrist. The timekeeping is the hard part and it's not user friendly especially if you're not tech savvy. It takes a long time to set up analog time and can be frustrating. The digital time is even more of a pain to set it on exact time, but using the manual will make your life easier. Not to mention, you can't completely see the digital time when the analog hands are hovering over 4 to 7 o'clock. But overall, this watch was worth the 60 bucks I paid. Would buy again."
4,Good basis watch,"This is my first Casio watch, which I bought as a casual sports watch. Being a runner, I am not to happy with the small display area for the Stop Watch function, which is hard to see at times when the hour and minutes hands are between the 4 and 8 positions. This is also the same problem I get when trying to use the night light function to check time when it is dark."
2,Limited usefullness,"I wanted a watch that I didn't have to worry about what activities I was doing and be cautious about easily dinging it up. This is a very well built waterproof watch, but beyond basic timekeeping, the other features really seemed like an afterthought. The digital display is small and dim and in moderate to bright light, it is very difficult to read. The recessed buttons were a good idea, but actually using them is difficult (keeping a button pressed down for any length of time kills your fingers). The watch face is small and barely luminous in the dark. I dread having to change the time back an hour for DST or when traveling because you have to hold down the buttons for a looong time until the hands make it all the way around again. It's a decent rugged timepiece, but don't get it for it's bells and whistles."
2,Could be better.,"I just received this Casio. I have to say I'm disappointed.The first thing I noticed is how hard it is to see the digital display indoors. Virtually impossible in medium to dim light. There's a light button but I don't want to have to hit that every time.The other thing that bothers me is the lack of precision regarding the hour hand. If the big hand is at the 12 o'clock position, the hour hand is always off of the hour it should line up with. There is no way that I know of to adjust this.I was expecting more from this watch. Perhaps that was my fault, perhaps not. I'll probably be sending it back."
4,Above average watch.,"I've had this watch for over three years and haven't had any problems with it. It's been more or less a set it and forget it type of watch. I usually just set it for day light saving time / standard time.After three plus years the battery was still showing no signs of failure ! That got me concerned so I thought I would change it myself. Not ! Once I got the back off I see the most complex battery clamp I had ever seen !I paid $5 for the battery, and then another $7 to take it to a watch repair place to have them do it right. Took the guy about 5 minutes to do it.The band still looks good. The first G shock I bought had to have the band changed once a year.And that watch lasted over 12 years before I had to replace it.Another thing I wasn't happy about is it's not made in Japan, but assembled in Thailand with Japanese parts...Over all, I'm happy with it.It's been a problem free watch."
4,Great Sport Watch,I like everything about this watch except I wish it had a second hand. I use it during work and around my boat because it is very hardy.
5,watch,My son loves this watch and is really enjoying it! He likes that it is water proof and he enjoys all the settings. The watch came quickly!
3,average watch,"The watch is of good quality and very durable over all, however there are some flaws in the design. First the analog does not glow in the dark, like the analog of other sports watches, which makes the analog worthless during low light conditions. The second problem with the analog is the method used to set the time; you would have to hold down one button and wait for the analog to spin all the way around if you missed it the first time, there is no ""Reverse"" button. The digital display is also very small, it was not a problem for me but it can be a problem for those of you who cannot see very well."
4,great Casio watch,Am impressed with this watch...as usual Casio hits the mark with a simple but yet funcutal watch at a more then reasonable price. Great work from the Casio team....great service from the Amazon team......
3,50/50,It was too small for my liking I thought it was going to be face was going to be a little bigger. No a bad looking watchh just too small.
2,Heavy-duty watch though hard to read,"I previously owned G shock watches bought for the purpose of withstanding constant abuse in and around construction. Although the watches bulletproof and standing up well, the digital numbers displaying date, etc. are very tough to read during daylight hours."
5,Great Watch,This watch was exactly what I had expected. It's a great work watch and still looks good with the red accents.
4,In short I got a good deal on a G-Shock,"This is a great watch. It doesnt have all the great features what the other G-shocks give, but at 58$ I got a good deal. The dial is also a bit small than the other G-shocks, but it looks neat on a smaller hand like mine.Its a good value for money."
4,Very Nice G-Shock,"I am a huge fan of G-Shockthats why I bought this watch,its very nice looking , very nice, only things i can point out is when the arrows are pointing downward the little screen is hard to watch,also adjusting the clock on the arrows is a pain in the neck, since you can only move the Min Arrow forward, so Imagine if you need to adjust the DayLight saving ...!!also since the button is up on the right i some times press on it by mistake, so imagine needing to move 24 hours to adjust it again,i searched the manual for another way to adjust it, but there seems none,I love it , would have given it 5 Stars, just bec of the adjusting the arrow thing, but it kinda bugs you only when you buy it"
4,fino,"Transacción Rápida segura y confiable, buen producto y vendedor. El paquete llegó en el tiempo estimado de envío y en buen estado."
3,Ok Watch,Ok watch for the price but this watch was a lot smaller then I thought it would be. My other Gshock is much bigger.
3,"Lights, Please!",Just received the Casio G 100-BV today and found at first glance that the digital readout would not work for me. As a senior I still have good vision and use the chrono a lot but found this didn't show up at all like the online display of the watch. Too bad as the watch looked very attractive. Amazon was very understanding. I'm still looking for an analog with a clear if not big digital display.
4,"Good looking, solid watch","I was looking for a watch to wear casually on the weekends ... this fit the bill. Looks great, is super light and seems to be made of a solid quality. Only thing that was a little bit annoying was setting the time and date, a little annoying, and means you have to keep the little book in a safe place if you plan on changing it while travelling / day light savings etc ... Also, I searched other websites and noticed this watch was being sold at a much higher price on most other sites, a no brainer with Amazon's free shipping and customer service !"
5,Very good watch. I recommend it!,Very good watch. I recommend it! It is a little smaller than it looked but I still like it! !
4,Great everyday watch,"I've always favored Casio for watches for many years. No disappointment here. Very easy to read in all light, even glows in the dark after sunlight. I was looking for a simple rugged watch with a basic alarm. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is it's a little difficult to match up the digital time with the analog time, and with fall (back) time approaching, you can only advance the analog hands clockwise - making a long time to hold the advance button to go around 11 hours. I will purchase this watch again since my wife is very interested in owning one too. I will wait again for a gold box deal."
4,"Good price, Just fine functions",This watch is suitable for my teen son. he likes this. But the setup functions are not very user frientdly.
3,Nice watch but:,The hands and numbers are not visible in darkness. The hands and numbers are supposed to be visible in darkness but they are not.
5,excelente,"me gusto mucho el producto y estaba en buenas condiciones 100% responsables, el proceso fue muy rapido muchas gracias .."
4,Very nice fitted and durable watch for the price!,Great quality and lots of functions! Can't go wrong with G-Shock if your looking for a durable and multi-purpose watch!
2,so-so,"We were unable to set the digital portion of the watch. Too many knobs and such, and the one we were told to use did not function properly. I wish i had gone with a different watch."
5,Great,Great product. Exactly what I ordered. It's been over a month and it works like a champ. I have really enjoyed it.
3,Casio G100-1BV G-Shock,I saw this watch on web and i like that but when i wear this watch so i am wondering this watch have a plastic strip it's not good when i where this watch so i had a little pen on my wrist so i decide when i go some party or event so i wear it but not use in casual use i bought one Casio simple watch from wall mart only $25 it's very good in casual use.
2,No contiene caja (Not case),El reloj llegó en una bolsa y no en la caja que muestran que debería llegar. Desafortunadamente no puedo devolverlo por que vivo en Colombia suramerica y debo viajar cuanto antes a mi país.The watch came in a bag and not in the box showing that it should go. Unfortunately I can not return because I live in Colombia South America and I travel to my country as soon as possible.(google translator)
4,watch review,Solid Casio product. The only minor flaw I have encountered with the watch is the minute and hour hands will block the bottom digital readout.
3,After one year...,"I have owned this watch for over a year and wear it daily. I wear it at home, work and gym.Pros-Colors have not faded-Accurate. After making an adjustment for daylight savings time it stays accurate until the next setting.-Comfortable-ToughCons-Not completely water resistant. When changing temp extremes, condensation forms until the watch acclimates.-Date is blocked every 30 minutes. Since I tend to forget the date often AND have to write it often, not a good combo.Overall.This watch is ok- I would buy a Casio G-shock again but not this model."
1,Beware of purchasing Casio G100 1BV,"Had the watch less than two months completely went dead - no damage to watch - sent to Casio for repair - after return from Casio the watch died again within 10 days - Neither Casio, nor Amazon, will stand behind the watch purchase - that should be a warning to all potential purchasers."
2,Digital Display Unreadable,"I prefer dual analog/digital display Casio's but this one was a mistake. The digital display is too small with too little contrast between the characters and the background. One cannot glance at the digital display, one must pause and focus on it to read it. I too usually leave it displaying the date and just glancing at the watch, like when signing a check, isn't a causal gesture, it requires holding the watch at the right angle, right distance and without motion. And give up on the digital display between :22 and :37 minutes past the hour."
1,Casio G100-1BV Watch Review,"This watch has a very nice appearance. I am fond of analogue-digital watches and this one is one of the most attractive.... but it has a killer design flaw that made me return it almost instantly. You can only adjust the analogue hands forwards ... very slowly. You can only move the hands forwards in 20 second increments, so if your watch is running a few moments fast then you have to go through more than 11 hours in 20 second increments. I.e. Press a button once and move the hands 20 seconds forwards with each button press! What about time changes required with travelling? What about changes required with Daylight Savings Time? This design makes the watch an absolute no go with me."
3,Overall Good - Some Complaints,"Pros: This watch is quite accurate. I've never had to make any adjustments to it and have been wearing it for nearly two years. Still on the first battery. This watch is also incredibly rugged. I am an active, active outdoor adventurer and have ABUSED this watch. It's never once asked me to ease up on it; it just keeps telling me the time. This includes a couple SCUBA dives.Cons: The light only lights the small digital display at the bottom of the watch. If, like me, you keep the digital display on the date mode, the night light won't help you much. I don't believe this watch has ever leaked, but if the temperature is cool, this watch fogs up. And finally, if the time is between 25 past the hour and 35 past the hour, don't even think about being able to read the digital display at the bottom; the minute hand WILL obscure your view.Overall this is a great, rugged watch for the price."
4,Casio Men's G100-1BV (Black) Watch,"I would like to inform people is that the dial and the watch itself look pretty big in the picture (which is why I ordered it), but in reality is medium-sized...I would say 'smart'. I like it that way too.The only thing annoying is that top-left button used for positioning(winding, moving etc.) the analog hands takes time and the button is a little difficult to keep pressed down.Overall, very good watch for the price. Good looking and good quality."
2,Beautiful watch but with a very small dial,I loved the watch but it looks ridiculously small on my wrist that I had to give it to my son gladly. After measuring the dial I found out that it measures 29 mm and not 44 as advertised on Amazon. What a dissapointment for me and a delight for my son.
5,no es tan grande,"tremendo reloj materual altamente resistente, se siente pesado, nado tranquilamente en la piscina lo surmejo y no entra agua, hora digital/analogica, luz, en fin un buen reloj.. lo recomiendo"
3,Must be a G shock sir,This is a ok watch from Casio. We bought this watch for our 39 year old son as a gift. He wears it all the time now. Casio G-Shock lives up to its name by now producing their great line of watches in a variety of colors that make it more enjoyable to wear. Another nice addition to this watch is the cool wave designs on the watch band. I really liked this other watchCasio Men's Polygon
4,Boyfriend's Pick,"My boyfriend chose this watch, he loves all of the G-Shock features. However, this is going to be his sort of everyday watch, it looks a bit small on his wrist compared to the usual sized watch he wears."
4,nice watch,"for its price, definitely worth it. only flaw is setting the time, you have to hold the h-set button for really long and wait."
2,Can't read the LCD Display,"Great price, and good size for a medium size wrist, but unfortunately, the LCD display is small, and very hard to read. You need to angle it in bright sunshine, or push the light button to read it. Also, the Minute hand completely blocks the display when it is anywhere near the 6:00 o'clock position. Also, the hour hand is a different color which was hard to get used to. I had to return it, because I could not read the display."
1,Poor Attempt at a Bunch of (...),"I was really disappointed in this CD. I've never heard Pinkard & Bowden live before, and I hope I never have to again! Their studio-produced songs are so witty I quess I expected the same of their live comedy. The only tracks worth listening to are the songs, only a few of which were not poor (...) attempts at dirty jokes. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this one! But if you enjoy this type of humor, I think Rodney Carrington is much better at it than these guys."
3,ok... but could of been better!!!,"whether you are a fan or not, galaxie 500 remains as one of the best, unknown bands of the last 20 years. their style remains unchallenged with the durability to remain timeless. however, in this latest album, ""500"" seems to take a step back in their meloncholic, progressive style that their fans have grown uccustomed to. their first two albums were great, but this one seems to need some work."
4,Mandarin Orange/Passion FRuit Smoothie Review,The Jet line of products are awesome! I have ordered in the past and have been as equally pleased with the product. My family loved the smoothies. The only suggestion is to get rid of some of the sugar....we had to add lime or lemon to the smoothies because they were a bit on the sweet side.
3,"It isn't the vol.3, it is the Vol. 8","Savigny major work about conlict of law, or private international law, in portuguise version. It is one of the must have books to any lawyer, but.... portuguise translations sometimes are very very poor..."
4,Jakes revisited,"Some of the stories were new to me and others I had read in some of his other books. Nonetheless, it was still a good read."
3,"Fine, but small","Face it. Four memory sticks just won't get you very far. You probably got one with the camera, two if you own a still camera and a video camera, bought at least one other to have space and probably a fourth one since then as they got cheaper per magabyte - so you'd have this full from the start, or soon after getting it. Add to that the fact that having a handy storage case will encourage you to get another stick or two, and you're certain to outgrow this case. Cheap is nice, but go for the Sony, which hold 8."
5,Excellent Choice for a growing Church,"If you have a small Church or a ""Mega-Church"", this book is for you! We are currently using it in a men's small group study and the classes are continually growing. the chapters are challenging and the study questions at the end of each chapter are very in depth and keep with the theme of each chapter. If you get this book, you won't be disappointed."
2,Chilton's Nissan Maxima 1993-98 Repair Ma,"Chilton's drawings are obscure, info is incomplete, and their approach presumes you are a professional mechanic. Haynes repair guide is a bit cheaper and much better for the moderate to accomplished do-it-yourselfer."
1,Not Very Good,Nissan: Maxima 1993-98 (Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manual)Not very useful and I was able to download a much better and detailed manual. This is basically useless.
3,Here we go.,"This CD features music from the Warner Brothers cartoon film scores by Carl Stalling. There are some complete scores and also some ""medleys"", with clips from various cartoons strung together. Carl Stalling was a master at writing music for cartoons, but something is lost when you just hear the music without seeing the cartoon."
4,missing 4 tracks from original release,"If you're looking at this release, then you probably already know who Carl Stalling is and know the album is clearly a 5-star release. Unfortunately, the download version lacks four tracks from the original release (iTunes is also missing the tracks). I was personally disappointed since I was replacing a lost CD and was trying to find a specific track that wasn't included. Otherwise it's great to see this available in a downloadable format."
4,It Won't Disapoint!,"It's Bill Mallonee meets mid-1960s American pop and the British Invasion! Bill's lyrics are at their best and the band is musically tight. After a half-dozen times in the CD player, S.O.S., You Know That, and She is Fading have fallen out as being among my favorites. If you are expecting Audible Sigh Number 2, or a return to the Blister Soul and Double Cure days, or the alt country rockin' sound a la Kenny Hutson ... you may be let down. Why only 4 stars? Well ... quite honestly, I still miss Kenny Hutson's presence in the band. But, give Summershine a listen anyway. I promise that it won't disappoint!"
4,Come on Get Happy,"As introspective as always, but a little more happy about it. Wonderful turn of phrases and a melody to hum and a beat to tap along with. A new, yet familiar feel. Take a chance on some good music with lyrics with a lot of depth. Enjoy a little Summershine."
5,Another undiscovered gem from the VOL,"Well after Audible Sigh it was a bit of a shock to hear the new album. Good? Yes. Alt-country? No! If you're expecting the country vibe of tracks like ""Resplendent"" you will be very surprised. I know I was. What you get is the kind of jangly, good feeling music that has you cruising down the a long stretch of highway in your open top car watching the sun bouncing of the hood without a care in the world. You can never have too much of that kind of feeling. Conjuring images of Tom Petty, Steve Earle, REM and The Beatles, ""Summershine"" is 13 tracks which flow from reflective and minimalist to lush and joyful with no effort at all. But that's great songwriting for you."
4,"Good, but no Audible Sigh","The good news is that the first two songs, and the last song, are just about worth the price of the whole album. And there are some other good songs too. There were just a couple too many sleepers on this one for me. Others may not agree, but this was just the way I experienced the album.If you want to hear Viggies at their best, pick up Audible Sigh, which is phenomenal."
5,Lost and Found,"Summershine is a little different from the more traditional Dylanesque V.O.L. material that precedes it. This album is rooted musically in well crafted pop songs that harken back to The Who, The Beatles, and most other Brit pop. But what really makes this disc standout is that the songs don't simply tell a story, but take you on the journey. Bill Mallonee is simply the best lyricist I have ever heard. This album came out around 09-11-01 and was lost along with many more important things. These were the songs that lifted my aching heart. While Bill still puts out brilliant music this was V.O.L.'s swan song. It is so easy to understand why the change in direction was necessary. This band knew that they had created a masterpiece that never reached its potential in sales or recognition. Truly a tough act to follow. I own over 2,000 albums. This one makes my all time top five. To me this disc is like finding your favorite sweater in the bottom of your closet in November."
3,"End of a band, end of an era","Summershine turned out to be the swan song of the Vigilantes of Love. Most of VOL CD's were distinctive and unique from each other. Summershine is no exception. Front man Bill Mallonee managed to merge brit pop and folk/Americana into a new hybrid. The songs are thus full of contradictions; bouncy yet stark, hopeless in subject but full of warm melody.While the attempt was admirable, the result seems to disappoint. For fans that are used to the deeper, more poetic lyrics of earlier band releases, the lighter tone seemed off the mark. For Americana fans, who had been brought to the band through efforts such as To the Roof of the Sky and Audible Sigh, the music was too pop.I think overall the work is decent, it holds up ok, it is just not up to the standards that fans had understandably come to expect from a really good band.The end of a band, the end of an era."
3,I feel a little bit cheated,"The Night's Dawn series was a very interesting one to read. The dead coming back to life, battle between ships in space and soldiers on planets and astroids, this was a fun read.Some of the problems with the series have already been stated. Too many characters. Too many plot lines. Too complex happenings.However, in a strange way, this did not detract my enjoyment of the series. I just keep these books and whenever I want I skim them again, following a plot I neglected the last time I read these books.The problem is with the ending of the book. People struggle to find meaning and a away to settle the impossible situation that has been created. You expect something original to be found at the end of their quest but it just ended in a most bannal way.The ending sort of ruined some of my enjoyment of this series. Hamilton, I expected something more!"
2,Um...It Ends,"Imagine traveling zillions of light years and battling murderous enemies so that you may find the meaning of life or failing that how to stop a Satanic invasion from overrunning humanity. You finally meet God, and you're so exhilirated that somehow you got to this point that you even manage to ignore that God is an idiot who tells you to have faith, and what you do is what you believe. After reading 3,500+ pages in order to reach the plot's resolution, and while the trilogy really was a waste of time I have to admire Hamilton: he wrote almost 4,000 pages of crap, managed to get it published, and managed to get a lot of readers (myself included) to read it. Is life really this boring and meaningless?"
1,Worst Ending Ever,Three words: Deus Ex Machina. I couldn't feel compassion for any of the possessed. Trying to engender empathy for them was a tremendous mistake. I only kept reading the chapters on Stephanie and company to see in what horrible manner Cochrane would die. What an utterly shallow and contemptible character.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Possessed planet nicking problem means captain's alien deity quest.With the propensity for large groups of possessed to take over planets and then piss off with them so no-one can take their bodies back from them becoming a serious problem, the alien Tyrathca may have led them to a solution.In the past a serious space entity may have helped them out, and this is what our heroes want to try and find to see if it can do the same thing for them, while others try and deal with the crazed cult killers and other problems, and make some discoveries about the origins of the Confederation split into the bargain.4 out of 5"
1,cheesy doorstop,This was the first and only book I have ever read by Mr. Hamilton. I found it to be overly long poorly edited space opera. A bunch of cardboard characters surround a ridiculously lucky space captain who screws his way across the known universe. There is nothing clever about the plot. There is no character depth. There's no interesting speculation about the future. I can't think of anything redeeming about this book. It's over 1300 pages of juvenile garbage. And it's only the first book of a trilogy.
5,Ga Paa!,"Voltaire has left us an account of a great general that is never dry, always entertaining, and honest. While Voltaire gives Charles his due as a charismatic leader and great general, he seems to have written this book more as a vehicle to expose the King's dark side. Charles waged war for war's sake and is not glorified here as might be the tendency among other writers. Charles was among the most daring, colorful and skillful military leaders ever to take to the field. He was also a reckless, thoughtless, war monger who inherited one of the most powerful countries on earth at the time and in a few years, lost it. His selfish ambitions also cost the Swedish people dearly in lives.Altogether, a fine entertaining, informative, and instructional read."
1,1 of da worsest rap cd's ever!,"Damn, this one is baaaaaaada than bad rather worst. I bought KK in store cuz of da cover, when i put into the CD and pushed play i felt like crush this album. Never mind, keep ya handz of this s**t.Thankz for reading this!!Tray Dawg KALI STYLE"
4,HARD BUT REALISTIC,YES ALL MY FRIENDS LOVE THIS ALBUM I WANT TO NO IF HES GOT ANY OLDER OR NEW MATERIAL COMMIG OUT OR OUT YET BUT THIS ALBUM IS THE BOMB BELIEVE THAT YALL NOT HEEARING ME
3,works OK,"I bought it to hang my wheelbarrow, it lets the wheelbarrow hang from the wall but not as close to the wall as i would like. I think it would work great for a ladder or simular tool."
5,GREAT Bracket !!,"They should give this a new part number to get rid of the old negative reviews from when it was plastic. This is a terrific, well-made, STRONG bracket made of steel with a nice, durable painted finish. Rated for 50 lbs., but I'd bet it will hold a lot more than that.I originally bought two - used one for a 10' stepladder / one for a wheelbarrow - and I just placed a new order for another. Personally I like that (as long as you measure properly) you can stand up stepladders tightly against the wall, and just lift them an inch or so to take them down."
1,Don't waste your money,"I should have known better to think that this little piece of plastic was enough to hold a big metal wheelbarrow. The thing broke shortly after it was installed, and the wheelbarrow fell on my car."
1,"Great for storing ladders,and whellbarrows","These brackets work great for storing ladders, and wheelbarrows, keeps the clutter out of the garage, and stores them neatly on the wall,out of the way."
5,Worked perfectly for ladder and wheelbarrow.,"Worked fine for my wheelbarrow, and two different ladders. One of the ladders is a very heavy and it had no problem.Like others, mine was not plastic but steel. The description should be changed."
2,Nope --,"Shoot -- this piece simply doesn't do what it's suppose to do. It slips in the electric drill. It doesn't have the power in the rechargeable drill. It doesn't work. It's that simple. I suppose it you were working in sand or mulch, you would be okay, but in standard soil, this is not a shortcut. It's a waste of money."
3,Great for planting bulbs,Takes the work out of planting bulbs is a real labor saving device and works with a good cordless drill.
5,Great,Item received was just as described. It works very well. It arrived earlier than estimated by the shipper. I had no problems with this order.
5,Worked Great,"I purchased this item to plant about 70 bare root trees. It worked great. It saved tons of time verses digging the holes with a shovel. Yes if you hit rocks or roots it will get jammed up, but thats the nature of the beast when you dig. Same thing would happen with a shovel right? I would suggest using a corded drill if you have a lot of trees to plant. A cordless would work fine for a couple of trees but would go dead pretty fast as it takes a fair amount of power to get through the grass and dirt. Anyway, product worked great and is worth the money."
3,"So Sexy, but Pinches Your Toes","I hated to return these shoes because they are so cute and sexy, but I wouldn't be able to walk in them for long as they pinch my toes and one rubbed against the side of the opening (a blister in the making). Loved them but had to return them."
3,Great for kids,"This book is comprehensive and informative enough for kids. (Recommended for ages 9 to 12) But for more serious weather watchers, they might crave for a more in-depth look at sky-watching. However, this is a good place to start for children learning about weather."
2,It wasn't very good,"I am very sorry to say, that when I got to page 17, I was very bored with the book. It took me forever to read it because my mind kept wondering. I just put it down and started another book. AI couldn't read it any more"
3,Sad,This book was good it was sad that the cousin that tried so hard to be accepted was lost forever in the end. I feel this book has a lot to say to young readers in terms of relationships. People are not always going to be around forever so it is best to love them where they are at.
5,This book deserves a number10! I loved it!,This story was one of the best stories I have every read. Even though the story is fiction it seems very realistic. The story was sad at points but I loved the book!
5,This book is DA BOMB!!!!!!!!,"I loved this book it was hard for me to put it down, and it was also sad"
2,Not the best,Cousins I think was a bit dull and trite. The first five pages talk about puttin' love and kisses into fried chicken. The some old guy comes in who likes to go around without his pants. After patty Ann dies it gets really dull. Cammy lies around in bed moaning and sobbing for months and months. She doesn't even go to school! And the part about Elodie's spirit being possesed and Patt Ann's ghost are a bit muc i think.
4,Better than expected.,The book came to me sooner than I expected and in good condition. It was well wrapped and protected.The content is extremely challenging and I am find so many nuggets that I want to hoard in my mind.
2,the review,"this album could have been a lot better and it seems as if it were thrown together. you really can't bad mouth jt or daz because they both have talent, but I really have to admitt this wasn't one of jt's best release. No doubt when you see a collaboration like that you automatically assume your going to like it. Tracks 1,4, and 9 in my opinion are the only ones that really stand out and there are only 12 tracks. These two really could have made some noise on the charts if for one the tracks were produced better and two if jt and daz were on more songs together. Expect these two to do it again, but with better oraganazation and production."
4,Missing 3 tracks - One was the highlight of the LPs.,"I first bought this as a double LP and it was probably my favorite of the 1000+ LPs I owned. I was a little late entering the digital age (1991), and this CD was one of the first I bought (the same day as buying my first CD player). Found it ironic that after years of missing CD ""bonus tracks"" because I only bought LPs that one of my first CDs would be missing not two, but three LP tracks. It is missing Richie Havens rendition of Vigilante Man (truly the highlight of the LPs). It is also missing Odetta's Why Oh Why (a great children's song with wonderful narration by Robert Ryan about kids and love) and Judy Collins version of So Long (It's Been Good to Know Yuh), one of Woody's best Dust Bowl songs. Still a very good CD, but the exclusion of three tracks (especially Vigilante Man) is almost unforgivable."
4,SOME ARTISTS INFLUENCE BY WOODY DO WELL,WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF A LITTLE TOO MUCH BOB DYLAN THIS IS A FINE TRIBUTE FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE INFLUENCED BY GUTHRIE'S STYLE...INCLUDING ARLO. FINE TOPIC RANGE OF HIS WRITING
2,"The title song sounds ""diabolic""","I love Sally Olfield's music and her beautiful voice. ""Flaming Star"" is the most recent addition to my collection of her records. The music is lovely, but I found the title song's refrain sounding ""diabolic."" It is sung repeatedly over and over in some foreign language with the words: ""Korienge ko DIABALO ku ramalla halla.""I couldn't find any English translation of these words. and because I don't keep or listen to any satanic music, I plan to ditch this particular record.If anyone knows the meaning of the phrase quoted above, I would appreciate a comment."
5,"Even if you hate to cook, you'll love reading this cookbook","Peg Bracken writes hilariously about cooking when you hate to. Perfectly free of the contemporary idea that cooking is supposed to be fun, she deals humorously with the challenge of getting in and out of the kitchen as fast as possible. Her chapter titles (""Company's Coming, or, Your Back's to the Wall""; ""Dinner--Can't We Take Them Out to?"") and her recipe titles (""The out-of-season unstuffed turkey dinner, or, of all my husband's relatives, I like myself the best"") compete to amuse you. Her endearing honesty (""A lot of these recipes aren't very exciting. In fact, some are pretty dull. So are recipes in the other cookbooks, but the other cookbooks don't admit it"") creates an instant bond between her and the reader. Even if you like to cook, you'll enjoy reading this book. And, if you hate to cook so much that you're never going to make a single one of even these simple recipes, you will still enjoy reading them."
2,Just OK,"I am doing the low carb way of eating. I love Dana Carpender's books, and since she recommended this book, I thought I'd like it too. Sorry, but I just didn't care for this book. I'm glad I got it cheap. It was a waste of money though even still."
5,"Funny, and the recipes are good, too.","This book is extremely funny even if you enjoy cooking, as I do. Some of her recipes reflect the time in which the book was written (lots of canned food) but most of them are actually quite tasty. It's fun to read even if you never cook one of the recipes."
4,I HATE TO COOK BOOK,STILL THE IDEAL GIFT FOR BRIDES AND THIS GRANDMA HAS WELCOMED MANY INTO THE FAMILY
4,A funny little gem of a book whether you cook or not!,"I confess that I'm the type who likes to occasionally read a cookbook whether or not I cook much of what's in it. I do not have a lot of time to cook and my mother before me wasn't into it either, but man, Peg Bracken's cookbooks are funny reads even if you don't cook anything out of them. (Although the recipes are pretty good when I do make them, and most of them have aged well and can still be made and served today, 40+ years after the first book came out. ) Her ""I Hate to Housekeep"" book is also funny and contains a lot of time saving tips. Hilary Knight's drawings add a lot to the overall tone and humor of the book as well. The effect is sort of like Betty MacDonald decided to start writing cookbooks with the help of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. I would recommend the older editions of the books if you can find them, because stuff tends to get edited out of later editions and you don't want to miss any of Peg Bracken's funny bits."
4,Our old standby,"Her humor is great, and my wife and I have enjoyed many of the recipes -- Stayabed Stew (made in a crockpot), is among our favorites for cold winter days."
5,"A unique, clever story & colorful, charming illustrations","This is a wonderful book that introduces young readers to the world of art in a most imaginative way. My son has ridden the carousel in Central Park, so he had no trouble imagining that there might be a squirrel living in a cozy apartment in the top. Lithgow's rhymes are very clever, and it is especially fun to listen to him reading the story on the enclosed CD. The illustrations are terrific too."
4,alternate morals,"It's a cute story, but I'm a little unsure about the morals behind a squirrell using someone's paints without permission. It's kind of...um..stealing. It's cute for a young reader who may not yet have the concept of property."
2,A wonderful picture book but not for kids,"I was pleased and intrigued when I first picked up Micawber and began to read it to my precocious 4 year old. Unfortunately she never listened past the middle pages. She lost interest quickly as the text was not geared at all for her age group. I contunued to read the story more for myself than for her at that point and was surprised to think that this was a story written for children. I don't think it would have held the interest of my older child either and he is close to 8 years old. As much as I respect John Lithgow as an actor, I'm sorry to say that this is a children's book written for grown-ups."
1,Not enough interest for young children,"Perhaps I am in the minority here, but I was not impressed with this book. The best thing about it were the pictures. The basic story is good, but the book uses language that many adults, let alone kids, don't understand. I do believe we should use ""grownup"" language when talking to kids to help their grammar and vocabulary, but the flow of this book seems awkward and out of place to me. We bought several books about NYC before a trip to try to aid in educating the children about NYC, but this one did nothing. Other books, such as ""A Walk in New York"" or ""From the Mixed up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"", however, were very much enjoyed and requested over and over. This book was read once and put aside. There are so many better books out there with more interesting, educational stories for kids."
1,There are better books that aren't so insulting,"The title bugged me but I got the book anyway because it was in the bargain bin and I thought it might be useful. And it could be if I could overlook the constant lame woman jokes in every paragraph.Why does everything geared towards women have to be cute, or funny, or talk about Prada? It's just insulting, I think. This book talks down (I just really found it stupid how she brings up needing Tequila 4 times whilst working on a toilet...).I'm actually a pretty girly girl but I just don't like books like this that think they have to talk to me in a cutesy voice and use pink tools to get me to do something.The Readers Digest book of Home Repairs is FAR superior with great photos, a list of tools and simple explanations with easy to follow instructions. It's not written for a woman, it's not written for a man - it's written for people who need to fix stuff and just want to know how to do it."
5,Norma hits the nail on the head!!,"I never would have thought I could fix a leaky faucet, but I did. Chix Can Fix led the way. It's straight foward,with clear diagrams and great tips. Norma gives you the confidence you need to want to attempt it on your own. I'm so glad I bought the book and I recommend it as a must have. It even made me laugh out loud at some of the funny situations Norma and her family have been in. (How many 'how to' books can do that??)"
4,the best series,"the second is the best seriesit talk about the life of whitney after the first runway show of whitney's line,olivia get promoted to be the new face of elle but she has a rival erin. and the tension rise between whitney and roxy after roxy doesn't make wear a whitney's clothes at the singer lights.i give to it fourth stars because the packages is only a plastic dvd case and when i opened the part that take the disc was broken"
4,The city season 2,Much more interesting than the first season... I Wasn't too captivated by the first series but there's more drama in the second season which makes you just want to keep watching. Would definitely recommend if you like The Hills and season one of The City.
1,"Boring with a capital ""B""","zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!! Watching these ""actors"" (i do mean actors) trying to talk/do fashion. They know NOTHING about fashion. Well, maybe boring fashion."
2,Better for my children,"This was a nice attempt but I admit that I wasn't crazy about the images. To me, tarot is about the images. They need to speak to me like a dream. This deck didn't. However, my 10 year old was trying to learn tarot and I got the deck for her. She loved it. The cards fit in her hands well and she connected with the childlike drawings. Because she was learning from a Rider Waite style book, she need those images and symbols. I was pleased to find a deck with African images for her.Frankly I like the Afro Brazilian Deck , African American Tarot, or Tarot of the Ages for better images."
5,Lovely Little Deck,"This has got to be the cutest deck ever! It is a Rider-Waite variation and has been created mainly for beginners. Colorful, light-hearted and whimsical, this deck is really small (2.5 - 3 inches) and looks like it has been drawn by children.There is no real traditional African art on these cards, but there is the flair of an African village in all scenes, and the faces of the people are black.If you like light-hearted and fun decks, this will probably become a favorite for you."
2,Sadly disappointed!!,"I love southern literature and try to keep up with the new volumes that come out; however, I felt completely let down by this collection of stories. Realizing that Christmas is not always the uplifting holiday that we hope it will be, these stories still left me feeling more depressed than thoughtful. I originally bought several copies to give as gifts, but after reading the entire book, I felt that I could not give someone else something that made me feel worse than I did before I picked it up. Reality may be very similar to these stories in some people's lives; however, at Christmas time, I would rather reach for what is the best and most honorable about humanity and leave the stark loneliness and despair for another time."
4,A Sad Southern Christmas,"I awarded 4 stars because it was a good book, but too sad for this jolly ole elf.However,I'm not sure what I expected. To me Christmas is a joyous holiday, but many of the stories in this collection were just the opposite. It left me with a hollow empty feeling.I must be wrong, since the book appears sold out on Amazon..and copies were flying off the shelf at the store in which I finally found it.As a gift for my 85 year old mother, I wanted something a little more uplifting. I plan to return the book in time for someone else to enjoy it and find a book with a bit more joy."
2,Poorly filmed 70's Cinder!,"My daughter,2 1/2, loves ballet, and loves the story of Cinderella. I thought this would be similar to the wonderful video, ""I want to be a ballerina"", wrong. It is a little scary and surreal with blurry color footage, and a slightly dated appearance. She now enjoys it, but we had to explain the characters and why the fairy godmother looks like a homeless women who just emerged from the sewer. It is o.k. considering there are not that many ballet videos for children."
2,not for kids,"I picked up this video to watch with my daughter, who, 10 minutes into the show said, ""I hate this video"". It's rather avante garde with regards to costumes; the music is dissonant, and the quality of the cinematography is poor. I cannot comment on the quality of the dancing, since I am no expert, but this will probably not appeal to younger children."
1,TERRIBLE - DO NOT BUY,"There's nothing good to say about this video. Costumes are terrible, staging is terrible, videography is dark and sometimes out of focus. We turned it off and threw it away after 5 minutes. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
5,This book was splindiferious!!! It really surprised me.,"My mind was set on this book after reading it. It touched me. I loved it! More then marvolus this book was! I would like to give special thanks to the wonderful woman who helped make this book be published, I know she worked very, very hard. She is my personal hero, somone who leads the troops, starts it all. I am proud to say this book was awesome!!"
5,This book is GREAT!! I LOVED it! It was perfect for all ages,This book was fantastic in my mind. I couldn't put it down. I give it 12 stars. And 4 thumbs up! This book had meaning to me. It taught me a lot and I would really like to thank Paula Casey because I know she worked so hard to make this happen and to get the book published.
4,Good sewing sissors,I'm very happy with these scissors for my sewing projects. They've worked well for me on both quilting cottons and more heavy decorator weight fabrics.
1,Not for me,"Perhaps I just got a lemon, but these were very low quality scissors. They did not cut well at all, uneven and rough. The spring consistently became jammed, even when just cutting paper. I bought these for their reputation and positive brand reviews, but as a serious sewer, these are not worth your money."
5,Great stuff,These scissors are nice and sharp. They are easy to use. I cut a lot of material and these scissors reduce my hand fatigue. Thanks.
5,Eccellente!,"'Dirty Italian' kept me laughing and learning from cover to cover. It's an educational and enjoyable read, filled with enough smut to make a porn-star blush, and enough information to make it a must-have in the library of every Italian major. Assuming you fall somewhere in the gap between porn-star and Italian major, this book is sure to bring you chuckles and knowledge. (And perhaps even help land you an Italian hottie!). Enjoy!"
4,Pre-split Roxy's Second Finest,"Eno is the vital link missing from this album. Although his contribution to Roxy's masterpiece 'For Your Pleasure' was simply described as 'synthesizer and tapes', he was as much the essence of the band as Ferry. With Ferry playing all the piano on 'Stranded', it's not clear that Eno's replacement Eddie Jobson is doing much besides finding his feet on this album. (Compare his background presence here with his impressive subsequent contribution to UK's eponymous album.)There is nothing on this album as catchy as 'Do the Strand' or 'Grey Lagoons'. There is no ensemble effort as grandiose as 'The Bogus Man'. Indeed, this is closer to a Ferry solo album. But there is the glorious 'Song for Europe', which has all the right ingredients: particuarly a good melody and some great sax playing. Even Jobson comes to the fore for this track.Buy this album, but only after first digesting 'For Your Pleasure'."
4,Solid but not a masterpiece,"With Eno gone Roxy Music hired the highly capable Eddie Jobson to take his place and the band were off to make ""Stranded"". Jobson did not have Eno's peculiar kind of imagination but he did a good job nonetheless; the sonic standout here is the treatment to Manzanera's guitar on ""Amazona"". The album begins strong with ""Street Life"" and moves through similar territory to the first two albums, although this time Ferry seems to be more in control. His dour, repetitive eight-minute ""Psalm"" drags the album down (this is when you know the band needs Eno) but then he picks things up again with the mocking ""Song For Europe"". ""Mother Of Pearl"" follows with one of his finest lyrics, and the album closes with the evocative ""Sunset"", a lost standard if there ever was one (well, the album did make #1 in the UK, no?). In all, ""Stranded"" is a worthy purchase, even if things begin to drag a little when there is no Eno to bounce things up."
3,"Like most RM albums, a couple fantastic songs, and dogs","I guess Roxy Music is like Notre Dame: you either love them or hate 'em. Im one of the few in the middle. This album has three utterly fantastic, grammy-eligible songs: ""Street Life"", ""Psalm"" (if you don't feel like going to church after this, you never will), and ""Mother of Pearl"" (perhaps RM's best song ever). the rest of the album is the usual meandering claptrap."
3,Life After Eno,"Stranded is not really that bad. It's more like a 3 1/2 star album. Jobson really doesn't click until Country Life, leaving this one a little pale in places. There are attempts by Mackay and Manzanera to recreate some of the Eno ""treatments"" on ""Amazona"" especially, which sounds like it would have fit just as comfotably on the first two albums. ""Street Life"", ""Mother Of Pearl"", and ""A Song For Europe"" are all standouts, true Roxy classics that made it to the old (unfortunately no longer available) Greatest Hits collection from the 70's, which was a 5 star collection if there ever was one. ""Psalm"", and ""Sunset"" are both too long and boring, damaging this one's overall value considerably. This one is very uneven, but not without it's great moments."
3,Weakest album,"I don't know why, but I've always been disappointed with this album. It just seems so below the usual Roxy standards. The songs seem too mellow and bland. The few heavier songs aren't even all that memorable either. Sorry, but this just doesn't seem like Roxy Music at all."
3,Last gasp of remnants after Eno left,"After Eno left, this album was still half-decent, but they went way downhill after that."
1,The one book the man SHOULDN'T have published,"Iain Banks is a Great Writer. Usually. I mean, take ""The Crow Road"". Or ""Espedair Street"". Or ""Walking on Glass"". Or any of his SF novels. But do not take the ""Canal Dreams"" in your hands. I don't know what caused this imitation of a novel to be published - a contract with the publishing house? A two-year writer's block? Beats me.All we get is a thin plot (and predictable, too), with even thinner protagonists. Waste of paper.Skip this one, save time, save money."
1,I would say pass,"Iain Banks is a highly respected writer. And the premise of this book - a musician trapped in the Panama Canal, due to the fact that she is travelling by ship because of a fear of flying. There are enough interesting ancillary characters to go somewhere. So why one star?Where do i start? Partly because of the annoying dream sequences that have absolutely no relevance to the story. Partly due to the fact that none of the characters are really developed. Partly because the cutting between the present and past of the central character is annoying. And partly becuase the story is simply stupid. The only reason that i have given it one star is because it started off with an interesting premise.I seriously recommend that you don't waste your time on this book. Perhaps there are better Bank's books out there to fill your time."
3,Not Banks' Best,"I was a little reluctant to read this book, being half Japanese, I didn't want to read some half-baked book with a Japanese female character in it. Although the main character, a famous Japanese cellist, surprised me. She's not a stereotypical Japanese woman and Banks has done some good research to make her a real character. I was definitely impressed by that (hence 3 stars). But the story itself really didn't do much for me. In the end, the demure Japanese cellist became a satire for the typical ""anime"" woman fighter, which was a bit disappointing. But like all of Banks' novels, it is well written and very readable."
5,Chicken Soup for the apathetic soul,"This book is a poignant reminder that service on the individual level, when rooted in the fundamental principles of democracy and equality, can affect change on a broad scale. Anyone looking to be inspired by lives that truly made a difference will enjoy it. Very well-written and impressively researched."
1,Gretchen Buchenholz,"Strange that this person is listed as a woman who changed modern America. Isn't this supposed to be a book about positive change? Gretchen Buchenholz's efforts to save border babies somehow seems more a vanity attempt, promoting herself, inviting her friends (the political, the rich and famous), and photo ops. Ms. Buchenolz always seems to have her name in the front of advertisements about her programs. What a beautiful facade....promoted for the benefit of babies. But if her purpose is to help babies, it doesn't seem that her track record is that good. In fact, it is shameful. Ask about Tanae Green and Stephanie Ramos, babies in the foster care agency run by Ms. Buchenholz.... Both babies died of horrible neglect, and Ms. Buchenholz didn't show her face to protect, protest, or speak up for them, even at the end of their lives. She was strangely silent, and used her connections to prevent bad publicity."
1,I am disappointed!!!,Any college student can write a book as this-- I'd rather read an Encyclopedia!!!
4,Beautiful writing,Theresa's Interior Castle has always been a difficult book for me. This translation and editing is refreshing and contemporary. Makes a difficult read into an enjoyable one.
2,Confusing and hard to understand!,"I made this purchase based on what previous readers wrote. Upon reading the first couple of chapters, I was finding it very hard to understand what it was trying to convey. The wording was odd, often times not really making sense. Im reading it little by little, as the content is pretty deep/profound. Im assuming it is best to first read her previous books to understand this book better. I think it will better prepare you for this book. I jumped ahead with this purchase. But, I think it will be worth reading"
1,Poor design,"Had to return these to Amazon. The cutting blade is too thin for the length it is. When cutting a half-inch branch, or larger, the blade bends to the side of the anvil. I called Fiskars and they said this item is not designed to cut live wood, only old or dead wood. Well, even then the blades bends. Just a poor design in my opinion."
3,Most notable for its historical importance.,"Greetings all,As I said in my review for the recently released Tosh live album ""Live and Dangerous in Boston 1976,"" this compilation of acoustic radio recordings paired along with interview excerpts is more for the devoted/hardcore Tosh fan than the casual listener.And similar to the Tosh ""Live at the One Love Peace Concert"" CD, this CD is also of historical importance/interest.Most importantly, it gives Tosh a voice and gives the late singer a medium upon which he can express his personal viewpoints on a number of issues that are not only rarely heard from him, but rarely heard period.The songs themselves are OK at best. I say only OK, because while they are definitely of interest to the Tosh fan, they won't be to those casual fans who are better off sticking to the best-of compilations and/or ""Legalize It,"" ""Equal Rights,"" and ""Wanted Dread and Alive.""Fight on,Mykal Roze"
2,I AM THAT I AM,"Hello?i am very glad because i have seen the arbum which i was looking for long time .i like this arbum especially the songs like stop that train and i am that i amIam an African but am living in BELGIUM but iam not sure to get this arbum because i dont have any card for an account bank but of course i have money , so please tell me the way i can use for getting this arbum . thanx"
5,Great CD,"The track ""Infinity"" is one of my all time favorite tracks. So I was thrilled there is more to 'Guru Josh than just this single. The whole CD maintains the high standard set by 'Infinity' so I love it alot! A CD worth buying!"
3,shingle cutter,I would not recommend this item. It cuts two asphalt shingles but the shingles have to be cold. The cutter is not nearly worth the price. You can use a hand shingle cutter knife just as quickly. I gave it to the workmen that assisted me on my roof. I didn't think it was worth selling.
2,what a disappointment,"First thing I saw when I received my box was ""made in China"", Harbor Freight sells one for $100, though it doesn't rip. As far as ripping, my help cannot keep a consistent measurement utilizing the gauge marks, maybe because I erroniously believed it would rip a shingle in one cut, not two or three lops. The preset holes are for either a three tab or the larger highend shingles. Regular metric dimensionals cannot be ripped,for the starter, they are 13"" high. For the money, I assumed it was American made, and what I had been tracking for the last 5 years. My bad."
5,Time and money saver,"I used this shingle cutter or shear to cut heavy laminated shingles.If you have ever tried to cut these when they wear cold,you will know what I'm talking about.If you do alot of shingling this is a must have tool.Like any other tool,if it is taken care of and adjusted from time to time it will last forever.If you ever needed a new blade,a machine shop could make one easy enough.It was worth the money."
4,Is it worth it?,"After being shown the operation of this piece of equipment, I had to have one. This is a very sweet piece of equipment. However, is it worth it?Do you realise that a good heavy duty paper cutter will do the same thing. Granted a regular paper cutter will not ""rip"" a shingle long way but that is why they make knives for, its faster just to take your knive and cut it.Some manufacturers still make all metal units that are aroung $20.00. The blades do go dull but no faster than this unit does and at 1 tenth the price you could by 10 for this one.Now during cold days when the shingles are cold, this cutter by far is superior to paper cutters in that you can realy put some preasure on it and never have to worry about breaking it.Use your best judgment, but I would buy another if I had to."
1,no way without real music,"I saw it for sale last week for $13.00, still wasn't worth picking up for that price without the orignal music.Lots of people probably say, so what, it doesn't have the original music.Well maybe next time they release a movie or TV show, why not have it dubbed with someone else's voice, I can't wait for someone to come up with the idea of putting in commercials. Maybe the next time you buy that Beatles album, it will be sung by the Chipmunks or the Lotus Lounge Lizards instead.Too bad it was a great show, but I will continue to wait to see the version I remember."
5,Back in Cincinnati,"I was thrilled to finally get this set, as I have fond memories of growing up with WKRP. It is unfortunate that so much of the music had to be changed (the generic stuff is quite bad) but what matters most to me is the characters - and they're wonderful. WKRP does a great job of mixing comedy and drama. This show will make you laugh - ""Fish Story"" in which Herb dresses as a giant carp - and cry - ""Who is Gordon Simms?"" in which we find out about Venus Flytrap's past. Welcome back, WKRP. When is season 2 coming out?"
3,Now that I've actually SEEN the DVDs: still a good show,"Firstly I think it's important to note how many of these reviews were written before the DVDs were even available. Yes, we're all upset about most of the music being removed, but the reviews are supposed to be about the DVD release itself, and based on first-hand experience.I enjoyed the DVD release, in spite of the omission of most of the original music. I do have the benefit of watching the show with a fresh perspective: My wife did not grow up in this country, so she had never seen WKRP, and is not familiar with a lot of the music that had been cut out. Having watched the DVDs together, we can confirm that the characters and stories still stand on their own. Obviously, I wish Fox had done a better job with this, but I do not feel that they ruined it. My three-star rating applies to this DVD release; I would give a much higher rating to the original program."
4,Music Replacements Make Better Sense,"First of all, contrary to original reports these are NOT double sided disc.Secondly I think the music replacements make better sense for WKRP than the original rock music. Think about it. Would a station with the futile staff of WKRP play actual top 40 rock music or cheesy generic rock? This would also help explain the terrible ratings. Also we do get the Red Wiggler, Ferryman Funeral Home jingles, Scum of the Earth and Hoyt Axton songs.Also contrary to popular belief Jennifer's doorbell scene has not been cut, however, Fly Me to the Moon has been replaced with a public domain song I can't quite make out the name of it.I hope they release the other three seasons rather quickly"
1,HOW CAN YOU REVIEW IF IT IS NOT OUT?,If this is a preorder how are you CERTAIN the music is NOT contained? Today is April 17th and Amazon solicits the first season of WKRP to be released April 24. Are you 100% CERTAIN the music is not on there or that it is the CUT syndicated copies? Or are you all assuming?!?!?! I too had bought some VHS versions of the show lacking the music and thought the show lost something with the editing. But I just hate for season one to get low sales and never get the other seasons if this version is really UNCUT and you all are reviewing something else.
1,Canceled My Pre-Order,"In spite of the criticism of giving a 1 star review to a DVD that I haven't seen, I have seen the lists of changes to the episodes. Yes, the music matters. Mr. Carlson asking Johnny Fever if those are dogs he hears comes to mind. The music matters. The fact that entire scenes are cut out because of music issues matters as well. I'm tired of ""better than nothing"" when it comes to thesae classics. I don't bear any ill-will towards Fox, they were caught in a bad situation. But I'd rather remember this show as it was."
1,Another Cancellation!!,"Thank You all for the heads up. The music was part of the set up to many of the jokes. I, for one, will not spend good-money on a set that has been butchered. I would have thought $60-$70 for a COMPLETE series would be more than fair. Greed from Fox wins again!!"
1,Terrible idea,"I was going to order, until I read that the original music has been removed from each episode and the scenes have been cropped. It was pointless for the company to release these shows in such a mutilated fashion. I'll go back to the fan club and see if anyone recorded the show when it was originally on the air."
1,Not going to buy it,"The reviews have convinced me not to buy it. This is show is often forgotten because it wasn't on long (by the way, just saw an interview with Tim Reid who pointed out that it was number 1 in the nation when it was cancelled) but it was extremely funny, and well done overall.I don't care if they clip some music here and there, but not when it relates to the scene, and not when huge portions of the scenes are missing. You want me to pay for that, put a $5 price tag on it, and I'll buy it."
1,EDITED,"To all the entertainment companies, we only want original unedited DVD's of movies and TV shows. If that is not possible then save your time an money because we don't want it. If the music isn't the same as broadcast on the show then it's edited garbage, shame on all concerned. If some of the old time rockers are demanding too much money then the hell with them. After my generation is gone,WKRP will be the only way to know Led Zepplin ever existed. I found this problem on an episode ofThat 70's Show. I was watching the episode on TV of an episode I have on DVD where on the TV version All the Young Dudes is playing in their hangout The Hub, on my DVD it's generic music, very sad. 0 Stars"
4,"Good or Bad, I didn't cancel","If no one bought this, would they ever make more? If the sales were huge, would they release an unedited version later? This was my quandry. I am disappointed at a couple of things. There are only 2 episodes that have a commentary. The extras are a bit short and seem incomplete. What about a documentary that looks at the casting process? The show is my favorite of all time. The DVD package is not bad, just a little thin on substance. The idea of hacking it up is ridiculous but that's the music business for you."
1,The RIAA knows where they can put this compilation,"I don't know how many people know this, but the people playing the characters on the show picked many of the songs used for the scenes. That is one reason that the music being played is so important to the show. The songs had meaning, they weren't there just ""because"". So, though I loved the show, the characters, the writing, etc., I'd feel like I'd be saying ""it's OK to change art just to save a buck.""No way does ""Hold my order, terrible dresser"" mean the same thing as ""Hold me closer, tiny dancer."" It doesn't even MAKE SENSE!!!!Let me know when the bootleg discs are available or when the copyrights expire (if the RIAA ever stops scr*wing us and stops bribing congress info changing the law in their favor every few years)."
2,The commentary? Oh please,"In the middle of Les Nessman's classic turkey day reporting from the Pinewood Shopping Center, I decided to turn on the audio commentary. I was treated to Hugh Wilson and Loni Anderson. Personally I think Hugh Wilson was drunk. He told a long boring and completely incomprehensible story having nothing to do with what was one of the great episodes in sitcom history.And where was the editing? Apparently all the editors were brain dead from inserting Muzak onto the station turntables so I guess they missed what was going out over the secondary audio."
5,So good to see our friends again,"One of the best television shows ever is still enjoyable 25 years after its original airing. The characters are outstanding and grow on you. The classic ""turkeys away,"" the contest no one could win and Les's date with Jennifer are all here. I've been sharing it with my kids and they have been enjoying it, too."
5,Show was not about the music,"I love this show. I loved it in the 70's when I was a teenager. It's too bad they had to remove some of the music, even worse if they had to cut whole scenes because of it, but the real reason this show was so great was the characters, the relationships, the goofiness, the fun. I forced my 15 year old son to watch the first show and, after that, he was hooked. I don't know how many 70's shows you could play for a teenager today and have them even give them a second look.If they ever get a clue and figure out how to put the music back, I'm all for it, and I will spend the money again to get the updated copy. That's not going to happen any time in the near future, however, so, until then, I'm very happy with this version. My only question, when is season two coming out?"
2,Season One so so,"Season one has some good epsiodes in it that are still funny- like Les and Herb fighting the PIG mascot from a rival station and the on air ""drunk"" with a can't get drunk Jonny, Venus and a state trooper. But alot of the episodes were just setting up who was who and what was what and aren't that funny. Hopefully they will release the other seasons and as is the norm with all shows it will be better. I don't watch it as much as I thought I would but it was still a good DVD worth buying so my kids could see what use to be one of my favt shows."
5,Now this if funny!!!!!!,"During its run on TV I used to watch WKRP faithfully with my Sister and Mom. I can't remember any other show that gave us more true belly laughs per episode than it did and the free turkey give away may be the single funniest comedy episode in TV history. Why this show only lasted three seasons I'll never know, but believe me, its just as funny this time around on dvd as it was in first run. This is a true classic that didn't have to rely on shock and awe to succeed.I'd love to see a reunion show."
1,This show deserved better!,"I work in radio, so you can imagine how close to my heart this show is. :-) Anyway, while I was aware some music change were going to be made, I still held out hope that it'd be well-put together...that quickly dashed when I found out this poor excuse for a collection not only replaced much of the original music, but also used the SYNDICATION cuts! Folks, WKRP's treatment by the network that ultimately resulted in its cancellation (how often did they change its time slot?) was bad enough, they shouldn't have had to deal w/the same treatment again some 25 years later.If you can live w/the cuts and music changes, don't let me stand in your way...however, if you're like me and will only accept these eps in their original form, you might try looking for original broadcast copies that circulate among video collectors...for me, that's the only way to see this show the way its creators/producers intended."
1,"Aww, HELL NO!!!!!!","I got the email recommendation and got really excited to click ""buy"" but thank GOD for customer reviews! I can't believe for as cheap as technology is and how many people have been waiting for this show to come to DVD with ALL MUSIC AND JOKES INTACT. That money couldn't be spent on music royalties. If price is an issue, RAISE IT! I for one would be glad to pay up to $45 a season if I could get it all and I'm sure I'm not alone. For now I'll keep watching my bootlegged DVD's that I paid $150 for all the seasons with all the memories. But it sure would be nice to have a nice, pretty, clean studio release to enjoy. I will gladly spend the money if you just pay the royalties and give us what we want."
1,Why Bother,"If Fox can't license key musical pieces that were integral to parts of several scenes, then why bother releasing what amounts to syndication episodes? The one I remember, and is mentioned a few times by other reviewers, that was a funny and great scene with Dr Johnny Fever playing Pink Floyd's song Dogs from their Animals album and Mr Carlson walks in as they are playing the sound of dogs barking through synthesizers. Hilarious scene!!If they can't release the full episodes then I for one will not bother. And shame to the record companies for making it prohibitive to license music that is no longer top 100 and is 30 years old. God forbid it drum up an interest in someone going out to buy a cd of some old music they loved and forgot about or the music company making a companion CD of all the soundtrack music and making their ""cut"" that way."
1,I would pay more!!!!!,I agree with the person that wrote they should charge more for the series intact. I would pay a premium price to get all the music and scenes included. I paid $60.00 for SNL's first season and I would pay even more to have the GREAT WKRP the way I remember. Please don't buy the butchered release and wait until they do it right.
5,Great to finally have this on DVD,"I have always been a big fan of WKRP. I was told that it would never be on DVD because they couldn't get permission from all the musical artists. That apparently hasn't changed. Instead of the classic rock, what is played is little rock riffs that probably don't belong to anything but what you realize is that it really doesn't make a difference. It is the writing that makes WKRP. (I have listened to little of the commentaries but they have been interesting.) Any DVD that includes ""As God as my witness, I thought turkeys could fly."" can't be bad!"
1,20th Century Fox: Recall WKRP,"I was so excited to learn of the release of WKRP several months ago. When I heard, however, that 20th Century Fox was deleting certain music tracks from the show, I said to myself no way could they be so stupid. Well, not only is 20th Century Fox stupid, they're incompetent! The shows have also been cut to pieces. They do not have the same running time as first aired! Wow, you just lost another customer 20th Century Fox for this series!"
1,cancelled order,"i buy TV series on DVD to see uncut,original versions of the shows.this may be the greatest show ever on TV,but i will not support a version that has cut out scenes and does not have the original music.as a consumer,i would have paid a high price to have this one right-but if it is not right,i'll just stick with whatever i can find that is original and uncut."
1,I won't buy it either,I'm glad I read the reviews before placing my order. I've decided not to purchase this set. What I will do is rent a disc from my Netflix account when they're released. I don't mind wasting a rental or two but there seems to be no reason to own this just yet.
1,aaaaaa....nope.,"I was over joyed to see that WKRP was finally coming to DVD. But them I was quickly heart-broken to find that the ""Complete First Season"" will in fact not be complete. I have waited far too long for this series to come out on DVD and now that it does, it's altered. The music has changed, some of the episodes have been shortened from hack job editing. The music was just as much a part of the show as the actors and to have them changed just goes to take away from the show. Sadly I will have to wait even longer for someone to get this one right."
1,Disappointment,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this classic TV show. I pre ordered it, got it in the mail, and watched it. After the first couple episodes I thought something wasn't right. Then it hit me; the music isn't right! There's only one original song in the whole season. What a disappointment! The music was a huge part of the show and it's absence is a terrible omission. Now I read that the episodes are missing alot of scenes. They really seem to have butchered one of TV's great shows. Unless these things are fixed I won't be buying season 2."
1,Why buy this Show?,I was really looking forward to purchasing this great sit-com but now that I know that almost all the music has been replaced and some episodes are the syndicated versions why bother? Why couldn't at least some of the songs be included. Box sets of SCTV and SNL included all the original music so there is no reason why more of an effort could of been made to include as much of the original music as possible. I would gladly have paid twice the price to get the original un-cut episodes but now I will just watch my video tapes of this series I recorded twenty years ago.
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money On This Set...,"...unless you don't care about heavily altered music and scenes cut out of the episodes. That is exactly what you will be getting if you spend your money on this lackluster effort by Fox Home Entertainment.I will wait this one out, and hope that the extremely negative attitudes from the buying public towards this set will make Fox realize that if they intend to do this, they had best do it RIGHT. Down with shoddy efforts like this!"
4,Digitally Enhanced would have been a nice touch,"I was looking forward to a nice, sharp picture quality, which this DVD set doesn't have. It would have been nice if they would have done the digitally remastered or digitally enhanced thing, but it doesn't look like they did. Otherwise, the content is as good as I remember it, just not the sharp picture I had hoped for."
1,"Rates a 0, which is what people should spend on it!","WKRP was the single best sitcom on television when it originally ran. For anyone to try and convince people that these hacked apart pieces of junk are truly ""magic"" as they are, is a freaking travesty! It has nothing to do with being a purist, nor elitist, or anything else.Without the 2-2.5 minutes of cut scenes in each episode, and the replaced with studio noodling music used, large chunks of the jokes and plots no longer make any sense - the music was an integral part of every single episode!!And the fact is not that it was truly too cost-prohibitive to retain the original music, but that it was too GREED-prohibitive to do so. A lot of extra cash was pocketed at the expense of the fans who will be wasting their money by buying this piece of crapola!"
1,This turkey hits the marketplace like a bag of wet cement.,A classic sitcom based around a radio station.Sadly the studio that owns this property doesn't seem to appreciate what part the MUSIC played in the series.Shame on you FOX.Go grub for money elsewhere; the money I'd have spent buying this will now stay in my wallet.
2,Not the same without the music,"I bought the first season knowing the original music would not be there. It's still fun to watch but loss of the music takes away the depth of the shows. For instance does anyone remember when Jennifer (Loni Anderson) says yes to Les' request to go out with her to an awards banquet, and in front of Herb no less. Les buys a wig and an outfit to get ready for the date and if you remember Foreigner's ""Hot Blooded"" is pumping out as he puts his outfit on in time to the music. It's gone, they overdubbed it with some studio garbage. It's not the same. Imagine Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas cruising in the pilot episode in the Ferrari Dino with muzak blaring instead of Phil Collins ""In the Night."" Nevertheless, it's good to watch this stuff again. I just wish they would have paid the fees and charged us 50 bucks for the season with the original music instead of 25 bucks with a band like Spinal Tap playing."
1,Don't Waste Your Money - Go For the Bootleg,"What a disappointment! Do it right or don't bother... Many of us would have paid top dollar for this thing done right. We've only been waiting for a couple of decades. The best sitcom ever made and this is what they do to it? If we're lucky, they won't waste anyone's time releasing any more krp like this.Don't waste your time with this dreck, get the bootleg!One star only because the system doesn't allow NO STARS."
5,Great to see this finally out!!!!!,"Yes people, the music is not the same....many overdubs, but seriously...GET OVER IT!!!! WKRP is one of the funniest shows ever, and it's great to finally have this treasure on DVD. I for one cannot wait until the other seasons are released!!!!!! My wife had never seen the show and I am introducing her to it through the DVD's. She LOVES IT, and it takes me back to when I was a young guy watching it with my family!!!!! If your a purist and you just have to have the original music then don't buy it...But if you like comedy, laughter, and overall fun family entertainment then this is the series for you!!!!"
2,Price not compatible with what you get,"I am not a fan of the show, just an occasional viewer. I am going to buy this as a gift, but I HARDLY think this price tag is worth THREE MEASLY DISCS! That is a rip off and rummaging the pockets of long time fans who have waited for years for this, not to mention the numerous complaints I've read about the music and the actual scenes missing. What a gyp! I actually don't know what to say, either wait until this goes on sale at your local Target and get it cheaper or live with this price tag.I know there are no extras, so I don't understand where they get off charging almost $35 for 3 discs. That is ridiculous! I think it's only worth it when it finally goes on sale somewhere. Don't bother."
3,"good, but not like it used to be","WKRP lacks the original music and just is not really very good without it. Many of the jokes lose their meaning when ""canned"" music is put in its place. Glad I bought it; just wish it would have been complete."
3,Fair,"Lacking in acting prowess, suspense, and plot. There are some funny moments, but overall pretty slow going. Would not watch again."
4,4 stars because of music. Otherswise perfect!,"I almost cancelled my order when I read that the music was gone and that the episdodes would be the sliced up versions. Yes the music is gone but I found that it really didnt matter. I do miss the Pink Floyd segment but oh well.The episodes seem to be the original versions. They are not sliced up. In fact with this DVD I have seen a few scenes I never saw before. I grew up on the reruns since I am only 35.My only gripe other than the music is that the special features was lacking. For that and the music I give it 4 stars. However, the acting and over all experience is 5 stars plus!!!Dont deny yourself this wonderful collection of shows just because of the music. If you miss the music that much then go get the DVDs and jam to them while watching!"
1,Hatchet job. Period.,"Who at Fox is responsible for this travesty? A pox on them, their house and their ancestors. I have heard my thoughts repeated over and over again in these reviews - the original music's gone, poor editing, etc. Shameful. The brilliant writing and humor remain, just now there are great gaping holes where WKRP goodness once was. I really want to 5 star the release because it IS WKRP. Can't do it now, though. Again, a travesty. And a pox on Fox."
1,Love the show but.........,"I wish I had read the reviews first especially the one star reviews, before I purcahsed this set. My bad. I loved the show but a huge part of that was because of the music. No ""Hot Blooded"" for Les!!!!! No intros for the ""Doctor""!!!!! Very disappointing. Needless to say I won't be bothering with the rest of the series. Question.....are FEMA and Fox run by the same people? Does Fox/FoxTV look for the stupidest people they can find and make them decision making exec's? Just wondering."
1,What a crying shame,"Bad news: If you love classic TV on DVD that contains original music -DON'T BUY WKRP. Fox didn't license the rock & roll music in a show about a rock & roll radio station!!!! They could easily have sold a ""Collector's Set"" or sold it online only (skipping retail) and it would have done great.Good news: If you love classic TV on DVD that contains original music - PLEASE DO BUY ""FREAKS AND GEEKS"", ""SCTV (numerous volumes), ""Saturday Night Live: the Complete First Season"", ""Miami Vice"" or others. Those are great shows that deserve your $ more than the badly butchered WKRP discs."
5,Super Series!,Fantastic! This is a great series and delivers lots of laughs! The turkeys away is unforgettable.
3,It's ok I guess...could have been executed in a better fashion,"I missed WKRP, and in general I understand the rights issues that delay or prevent comprehensive DVD releases. ""WKRP"" of course had a great deal of contemporary music, and I'm sure it must cost a fortune to clear the rights for every single bit of incidental music.In the end, I convinced myself that I enjoyed WKRP for the writing and the humor, not some lead-in music before a scene in Johnny Fever's recording booth.Bad move.I have no ear for such things, but even I could tell that something was ""off"" about the episodes. Example: in the episode with Carlson's grandson, there is a bit of ""Patton"" fanfar in a few key moments. This has been replaced with a generic trumpet lead-in that doesn't make a damn bit of sense.It's still very, very funny....but it's like watching your favorite series on a TV with bad reception. Maybe WKRP best exists in memory if they can't restore the episodes properly."
5,"Yes they changed the music, but the show is still great!!","I just watched some of WKRP, and yes they changed some of the music, but the show is great. Johnny Feaver is great, I laughed so hard. The show is very funny. I Know a lot of people are angry because they changed the music. It is dissapointing, but what we have is better than nothing at all. If this season does not sell well, the studio will not release the rest of the seasons. (Does anyone remember what happened to the following seasons of Night Court. They still have not came out with season 2.)Please buy this season it is great, and buying this season is the only way to ensure that they will release the other seasons."
4,Purchased as a gift item.,Used as a gift item. Product as shown and ordered enough at Amazon.com to receive their free shipping offer.
1,I think I'll pass,"Well, it would seem that the news is getting worse and worse about this long-awaited DVD release. I used to work at a local radio station here on Orlando when WKRP was on the air. I even saw Loni Anderson and Gary Sandy as they were entering a local restaurant. I had a ton of laughs watching this show and seeing the similarities and the incorrectness to actual broadcast radio. Now, I am laughing at the people who are trying to put this shameful set together to hopefully get some money for a probably worthless product. I can understand music rights aimed at the ""free downloads,"" but what I can't understand is that their music isn't played in its entirety on the show, where we can rip the audio track out. I would be proud to have ""my music"" on this great show stay intact! I don't see how the artists are losing any money over this. I may have to rent this video just to see if there is a hidden surprise. If there is one, I'd buy it! So for now, it's ""pre-order cancel time!"""
1,substituted music = no deal,"I refused to buy anymore season sets of Northern Exposure because of music substitution, and now that WKRP is being put out with the same approach to the music, I won't buy these either. If music was integral to ANY show, it was this one. Music substitution is shameful and stupid. I loved the show, but I will not be buying these DVDs."
2,Gordon Jump,"I just heard that MTM couldn't afford to license Gordon Jump's actual voice on the discs, so they got Fred ""Gopher"" Grandy to re-dub all his dialogue.But seriously, this was a fantastic show and the music played a very large role in it. Why bother if you can't do it right?Two stars because it was great once."
1,Another unhappy order-canceller,"Count me in on the swelling group of pre-order cancellations. I'd rather wait and see if the product stinks as bad as it sounds from the preliminary reports. If we're all wrong and it's really a great package, then I'll re-order it. But if it's as big of a hack job as it sounds, then forget it."
1,Devastated! I won't buy it...,"I've been waiting for years for this release and am devastated by the news that they butchered it! What I don't get is why the music rights is such a big deal to begin with. If you're lucky enough to be able to catch an un-butchered original episode, you'll notice that the music is key to setting up the humor but each sound bite is VERY short. With the exception of Jennifer's doorbell, which is recurring, for the most part only a tiny fraction of any single song is played - enough to be recognizable and set up the humor but that is all. If I were in the music business I'd be honored to have my work represented in this show. At any rate, I won't be buying and it is so sad that one of the best comedies in TV history has been abused this way."
1,C'mon FOX - pay attention here...,Man - look a the interest in this show... WKRP and the music are inseparable. I have waited years for this show to be released - as it was my absolute favorite when I was growing up. OK - I had a slight Bailey attraction too. Back to waiting patiently - NO SALE here.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...THE ORIGINAL MUSIC IS MISSING!,"Like many others who have reviewed this DVD boxed set, I was eager to buy it. I grew up watching WKRP In Cincinnati and have told my wife about it many times. I marked my calendar and showed up at a local store to buy it today.As soon as I read the back of the box, I put it back on the shelf in disgust.I refuse to buy a product so poorly handled. I would gladly have paid $10 more per set to have the original music intact. If Miami Vice could do it, the studio that owns the rights to WRKP in Cincinnati could have done it.This is sloppy, short-sighted, and inexcusable.KRP was a classic show that captured the spirit of the '70s -- music and all. There's no excuse for it to be butchered this way.When this boxed set is restored to its original state, I'll buy it. Until then, I'll be content to remember it for the classic that it was."
4,Why do people write reviews on products they don't have?,"I don't understand why people are writing reviews of products that they don't own and are not available yet. This space is for rating the product.WKRP will not be released until April 2007. We don't know if it will contain original music, we don't know what bonus features will be available in the set, we don't know anything about the packaging, and we don't know anything about the mastering or the transfers or the audio quality. So anyone that is writing a ""review"" of the WKRP set is just commenting on whether they remember liking the show. They are not helping the reader make a decision about the purchase of the disks.To all you ""reviewers"" out there - stop wasting time and space by writing about products that you don't own and haven't seen. Get the product first! Then review it."
1,I've been waiting for a year for this series,"I've been waiting a year for this series; however, since hearing how the original music has been removed from the episodes I'll be passing on the set. I would have paid double even triple for the real thing. Very disappointed in whom ever made this decision."
1,R.I.P.,To me the only reason to buy a dvd of a tv show is to get to see it the way you remember it and maybe see some things you have forgotten due to syndication cuts. Despite all the warnings I bought this set today thinking it was such a great show I could overlook some missing music. Well it was like viewing a loved one lying in a casket. The body was there but the soul was gone. I will let it go and move on {It was just a television show after all} I have my memories and I think it's better to have that than some cheap replacement that in time could make me forget about how wonderful the original was.
1,There must be other ways to do this,"Looking at Hugh Wilson (the show's creator) and Fox's comments, it seems like they missed an important point to the show - that the music is one of the characters and is integral to the show. They also seem to feel that they can only sell the show at $30.It's unfortunate that they didn't pass the rights onto Rhino or Shout and let them work through the licensing issues and release it under their brand titles.My guess is that they may look at this option in the future, so vote with your wallet and send a message to Fox."
1,Complete? What a CROCK!,"This is such a huge mistake... releasing a crummy WKRP set after making us fans wait so long. The NERVE of calling it a ""complete"" is the cherry on the cake of a low quality disaster.Caveat Emptor!!!"
1,"No music, not buyin' it!",How can they produce a DVD about a radio station without the music and call it a complete season. I've removed this from my cart. Either the music industry needs to get less stingy or the producers of DVD sets with a lot of music need to charge more to keep the original product in tact. I guess I'm a purist.
1,What A Shame,"What's this? FOX cannot afford to pay for the rights to use a few 1970s rock songs? Aren't these the same songs we've all heard 50,000+ times on the radio over the past 35+ years? Certainly FOX has enough lawyers and money to work something out. But the music isn't the end of the story here. Another major disappointment for me was the transfer quality. Maybe they didn't have the best equipment back then, but hey, things can and have been digitally corrected. I can't believe that you can actually see serious convergence errors clearly in the opening! What did you guys do, hold a camera up to a TV screen? The loss of music and the poor quality make this a terrible waste of money. It's too bad, too. I was waiting a LONG time for WKRP to come to DVD!"
5,The looniest radio station comes to DVD...finally!,"My prayers have been answered! I watched this T.V. show every chance I got when it was first run. I heard from others that copyright issues on the music originally featured on the series was the reason it's taken forever to get it transferred to DVD...and that some songs will be different. No matter: what really made this show was the great ensemble and zany writing, and still does. WKRP deserves its place amongst classic television shows simply because it's very good.Nearly thirty years since its debut, WKRP is still a gem.My feelings of elation? I think Dr. Johnny Fever said it best: ""Oh..and I almost forgot, fellow babies...BOOGER!!"""
5,WKRP in Cincinnati - The Complete First,Great seeing this show again. Some of their best stuff. Sure can't understand why we don't get to see re-runs of this one! Two of my favorite episodes where in the first season.
1,Very disappointing,"This is a great show, but if, as people here are saying, these episodes are edited and have the original songs replaced, I won't be buying this set. It's a pity, I've been waiting a long time for WKRP to come to DVD."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!! WASTE OF MONEY. DISGUSTING.,"I Love WKRP, but this is a waste of money. So many scenes are edited, you miss punchlines, you miss parts of storylines. Music is thrown right out the window, with elevator rock. You miss intro's to songs because they had to replace music. Listen, I love WKRP, but this was such a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. They really screwed up with this one. I hope they realize this and fix it and get it out the right way. I hope that the sales sucked so bad that they either have no choice to do it right or they won't bother to release the other seasons. Why bother? If you are not going to do it right, don't do it at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It is a joke how bad this is."
5,WKRP In Cincinnati Season 1,"Excellent product!!! Just need the other seasons!!! One season just whets your appetite. Need seasons two, three, four and five."
3,"The same was done with the ""Happy Days"" sets","From what I've been reading, they've done the same thing with the ""Happy Days"" releases with altered music due to the music licenseing problems."
4,Miss the original music!,"The comedy and the acting is as I remember from years ago; a truly enjoyable series. Unfortunately, almost all of the music has been replaced by generic ""rock"" sounds. While licensing issues forced this, it is still depressing because so much of the original music fit the situations so well."
5,Radio station par excellance,This DVD brings back great memories of 70s and 80s songs while experience classic sit-com humor. Each member of the cast fills a specific part of a disfunctional family. If you want to experience a comic journey through radio buy this DVD.
1,ditto,"after reading the other comments, I agree, its ALL or nothing....was really looking forward to this. But, I want ALL of the episode..."
1,Not interested any more!,"I cannot believe that the editing has been so poorly done on such a good show... and what is this situation about the music?!?! Those younger ones out there who never saw the program have no idea how important that music was to the show and therefore are unable to appreciate what an important part that music played in the atmosphere, the humour of WKRP. How disrespectful to the cast and crew of this classic. How tragic. Just don't buy this piece of waste."
5,I Guess I Was The Only One,"I guess I was the only person who watch and loved WKRP because it was one of the most genuinely funny TV shows ever. Apparently others who watched only did so because it had some music in it -- great scripts, endearing characters, and laugh out lot plot lines were just secondary.If the reports about music changes are true I am disappointed but not surprised. It had long been said that if WKRP ever made it to DVD (and there was a time when it was widely assumed that it never would) that music substitutions would be necessary. In any case this will NOT stop me from buying this set. The music was a nice addition to the series, but it wasn't the series itself."
1,Why?,"I was ready to leap at the chance to purchase ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" but I won't do it without the original music. I know music rights are expensive but dvds are not exactly expensive to make. You know they're making tons of money selling this stuff; the least they could do it present it as it originally aired ESPECIALLY since this show is about a radio station! ""WKRP"" deserves no less-it was a hiliarious, one of a kind show that many people would LOVE to own. Because of the lack of the original music, I will bet sales of this set will not be good and, as we know from ""Murphy Brown"", if it doesn't sell well, there won't be more seasons. It's sad to think we fans won't get to have this great show in our video libraries just as we remember it. I would love to watch them again and again but it won't happen when they're packaged like this. Fox, don't expect you can throw this turkey because it won't fly with the fans."
1,fly me to the moon,"No sadly I may never hear the doorbell ""play fly me to the moon"" again... Jennifer's doorbell played ""fly me to the moon"" originally but not in the dvd version. Every seen Carrie on TV? Imagine Carrie without the initial shower scene and imagine why one would be so confused about the rest of the movie. WKRP without the music and without ""fly me to the moon"" is sad and I am sad."
2,Not going to buy this,"I am not one to post comments but feel I need to do this for the record.If I am going to buy a DVD series it is because I want to see the episodes as they originally aired. I was overjoyed to see that 'WKRP in Cincinnati' was coming out on DVD, but after reading the reviews I fear I will have to forgo the pleasure.It's a pity that, because so many people will be willing to buy the butchered version, the rest of us will never be able to get the real thing."
5,Some of the best comedy of all times in one package.,High quality recordings of the First Season's episodes of the best TV Comedy Series ever. The characters of this show will not be found anywhere else.
1,ZERO stars!,"A friend loaned me his copy to watch over the holidays, and this is a total disappointment. Don't waste your time or money. This is NOT WKRP. WKRP was an innovative, funny show with a great soundtrack. This is nothing but a chopped up mess with the original music replaced and many great scenes deleted. We can only hope that someday the original WKRP will be released, but this isn't even close."
4,This is Hilarious!,"Really funny! If you are a fan, you'll really enjoy this item. It was packaged well and came on time too."
4,WKRP in Cincinnati,"I have been waiting for years for this show to come out on DVD and was thrilled when it finally did. I love it and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they don't have the original music on it. It's all generic, no name stuff."
3,Lack luster at best music,"The music dubs are a shame. I would of hoped they would used music that actually is from the era. If the music is from the 70's and 80's, then it is the music of unknowns. Thank god the creativity and humor of the show shines thru."
4,STILL FUNNY,"THIS SERIES IS AS FUNNY AS EVER. IT LOSES A STAR BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE ORIGINAL MUSIC IS NOT THERE. I LOVE IT WHEN ""THE BIG GUY"" WALKS INTO THE BOOTH AND JOHNNY FEVER IS PLAYING PINK FLOYDS ""DOGS"", IT'S JUST NOT QUITE THE SAME WITHOUT THE ""REAL"" MUSIC."
1,HOW???,HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON WHEN SCENES ARE CUT AND MUSIC IS CHANGED?!?!? IT IS NOT THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON!!!!!!
3,It's not gonna happen,"To all those of you who are complaining about the scene editing and the missing soundtrack, I basically agree with you. However, you have to realize one simple thing: it's not gonna happen. So at this point you are left with three options: 1) Buy this release 2) Search on the internet for a bootleg copy of questionable quality 3) Not own any copy at all and live on your own memories. Personally I chose option 1)"
1,Not ordering a crippled version,"Although I've been anticipating a DVD release of WKRP for a long time, I am saddened to hear that they have gutted this release. Why bother releasing an obviously-flawed version? I'll wait until they get it together and come out with a proper release."
1,Pre-Orders falling like Turkeys from the Sky,"I was SO excited when Amazon finally posted a ""real"" release date, that I pre-ordered Season 1 on the spot. Today, read that the music rights have not been cleared - and like so many others, that's okay - but when I read that segments involving uncleared music have been cut, well, that's just not the boxed set I was planning to buy. Like my fellow fans below, I too cancelled my pre-order today. Maybe Fox should take a look at the SNL: Season One Box, and do a little leg (legal) work and give us the episodes the fans want and deserve, we'd pay the extra money. I'll have to be content with my VHS copies a little longer."
1,Don't even release it!,"If you can't get the rights to the original music and can't show the original (not syndicated) versions, then PLEASE don't even bother releasing it! People who say the music is minor are so far off base. Folks are right, this show was one of the first to use original music and also that from lesser known artists. I was in my teens living in Cincinnati when this showed aired originally and have nothing but fondness for it but will not purchase this ""butchered"" version. If you think the music doesn't matter, I ask you this.......the episode with Baily and the Russian guy and he has the line ""hold me closer, tiny dancer"" with the Elton John song playing.....what are they going to replace that with? So sad............"
1,This release warrants NO stars! Shame on you Fox Video!,"I'm happy to join the long and ever increasing list of completely dissatisfied individuals who pre-ordered and then canceled their order for this abomination!I could have tolerated some music substitutions for those artists/music publishers who simply would've made licensing rights prohibitively expensive (e.g., Pink Floyd) but it was clear that absolutely NO effort was made to maintain any semblance of musical integrity. Not to mention the abridged versions of many of the episodes. Maybe I'll pick a copy up at the closeout aisle when Fox is forced to liquidate this miserable excuse for a DVD version of a classic TV show. I am sorely dissapointed!"
1,"No, no, no!!!!!","You have GOT to be kidding me!! I've waited all this time for this great show to finally be acknowledged, and THIS is how they do it? I guess I could probably deal with the music thing, although I wouldn't be happy about it, but CUT SCENES?? Why in the name of all that's holy would I spend money on DVDs full of chopped episodes? I thought the whole point of releasing shows on DVD was to get not only the ENTIRE show, but also all the little extras we all love. These guys can't even give us all the episodes correctly!! Let me know when the REAL collection comes out."
1,"Music is wrong, but even worse, stuff is cut out","I received this as a gift and have to say that it is a total ripoff. We all loved the original WKRP. It's bad enough theyre-dubbed all of the music due to licensing fees, but the hacked these up and removed things. For example, we never get to hearLes pronounce Chihuahua."
5,"NOW, Bring on Season Two, please!!!!!","People that left poor reviews are nuts! I almost did not buy WKRP on DVD because of them. This show is so wonderful and funny that it does not need the original music. The characters are SO good that I forgot all about the missing music...did not miss it. If you love the people and the stories...BUY THIS DVD! It's a good feeling to be in Cincinnati at WKRP, again! NOW, Bring on Season Two, please!!!!!"
1,Description is in error. Buyer beware.,"Something is wrong with the description of this item and the quantities being sold.My order was for ""SureCare Protective Small / Medium Underwear Count: 20,"" and that's what appears on my invoice and related documents. What I received is best described as ""SureCare Protective Medium Extra Heavy Underwear Count: 18."" Also, the packaging looks different.I'm keeping the item since it looks to be about the same as what I had really thought I was ordering. It looks like I just got 18 undies instead of the 20 I expected.I notice that the webpage for this item states that the quantity is 20 in one place and 18 in another!"
3,"a very good film, but one-sided","While I understand why Chicano students of the 1960s protested the unfair treatment that they received in schools, this film nevertheless portrays the non-Hispanic whites (or the Anglos) as wooden villians. This movie would have been better if it had shown more positive portrayals of them. It would have been nice to see some of them walking alongside the Chicanos, as a show of unison. I take exception because I am of Anglo-Saxon ancestry and I wish that these movies would stop villifying my ethnic group. We're not all racist monsters."
3,Almost a documentary,"Good intentions doesn't make a good movie, that's what I felt when I saw Walkout, the tale of a group of mexican americans (or chicanos as they are proud to be called) LA students in the late 60's, who fight, among other things, for the right of history recognition, respect of their heritage and equal treatment. So far so good, the fight for civil rights (Costa Gavras, Spike Lee, to name two directors who have acomplished great movies dealing political issues) can be material for the kind of films that stick in your soul for a lifetime, but Walkout falls short of achieving that goal, even though the ambientation is great, the movie is episodic and not very interesting. Its like a cable tv political panflet. I like Edward James Olmos and his passion for the latino cause, I hope his next project will be less obvious, that's what art and movies are about."
3,School review,"Great movie for teaching Hispanic rights and their fight for freedom. A few words of warning before you use it in class-there are numerous curse words in Spanish and English throughout the movie, at one point one student moons another, they do show a student being paddled for using Spanish which seemed to upset the students greatly. Make sure to do a lot of pre-teaching before you show the movie."
2,Twenty-year-old information lacks relevance,"This book was an assigned reading for a Women's Studies class in which I am enrolled. While I found some of the thoughts presented to be insightful, I was upset with the inclusion of old information. Most of the studies cited were from the 1980's, with some being over twenty years old. I do believe there is still a major problem in this country with oppression (gender and racial). However, I feel that great strides have been made in the last two decades, and to present old, outdated information only serves to reopen old wounds.The copyright on this book is 2004. I am truly disappointed that the supporting data used gives a distorted view of the presentation."
4,Great read for teens and adults,"Maggie Rose and Sass is a thought-provoking journey of two adolescent girls from vastly different cultures. We rejoice as the girls conquer their fears and become friends, realizing that they are more alike than different. Both teens and adults will enjoy this book, reminding us that cultural clashes are something we must all overcome. Learning about the real Kansas town the book is based upon is an added bonus."
5,A Gem,"Maggie Rose and Sass is a little gem of a book written by Eunice Boeve. It is set in a time not far past slavery andweaves the lives of ex-slaves and ex-slave owners together with the lives of two little girls who are meant to be friends but too hard-headed to try it. Maggie Rose is a white girl and a product of her grandmother's ignorant ideas on race. Forced into living with her progressive minded aunt and uncle in an all-black town, she begins to form her own ideas and opinions.I enjoyed this book so much that I have passed my copy on to my stepdaughter. I have a strong desire to make sure all of my children grow up with an appreciation for all ethicities and cultures. I want open-minded and open-hearted children, and this book is a good example of how that can happen and how hard the journey can sometimes be."
5,"Great, but could have been Better","There is a lot of great music on this CD - no question about that; it think it comes very close to being a complete collection of Marilyn's songs.Unfortunately several songs include the dialogues from the various film-soundtracks, which can be interesting, but in the long run only disturbs the the pleasure of listening to Marylin's singing.Many of these songs have been released previously, without the dialogues, so I really wonder why these soundtrack versions have been chosen.I had also hoped that the sound quality had been improved, but this may not be possible. The earliest recordings are already more than fifty years old. Having listened to these two CDs ( especially CD 1 ) you can only regret that Marilyn was not given the opportunity to record more; because she was really a very unique singer."
2,Ugly when viewed in person,"These shows looked great online, but when they arrived from Amazon, they looked strange. My wife said they looked like elf shoes. That was enough for me to send them back. Most Clarks look a little strange, but these were definitely not for me."
3,Men' Commander Slip-on,"This shoe is a dress shoe and not a casual slip-on as the pictureand description suggests. It's a very nice dress shoe but I was hopingfor a more casual look. Clarks is a great brand, worn them for years..."
3,Not Restaurant Recipes,"If you try these recipes, you will not duplicate pizzas cooked at Uno's, Gino's, Giordano's, etc. You will make a decent pizza (and I've had to experiment quite a bit to improve on Bruno's recipes), but don't be fooled into thinking that these are the real thing. And the basic deep dish recipe is just the same as the one you can get free at many sites on the internet. A better book is Evelyn Slomon's, but hers suffers, too."
4,two thumbs up!,"As a displaced Chicagoan, I was hurting for a good pizza. Bruno's recipes were easy to follow, quite tasty, and very Chicago-style. Although the intro is a little wordy, any self respecting Chicagoan or pizza connesuer(?) should try this book."
1,No Ideas Here,"I am a chef classicaly trained ...I've cooked for 35 years...I turn to books for ideas and to learn from people who just have the nack for food , I have to work at it.I am a New York style pizza lover and was hired to do deep dish. Knowing Chicago was the capital for this style I started my persuit.Now to the book,unless you have absolutely no clue how to make pizza,this book is worthless.It IS perfect for the begginer."
3,Low audio signal,"This is great stuff. I bought all of the available Sherlock Holmes DVDs starring Jeremy Brett. However, on this particular one (i.e., the whole set of DVDs in this particular set), and only on this particular one, the audio signal is very low. On my Legacy FOCUS speakers bi-amped at 300 watts rms per side and with the preamp's volume turned all the way up I could hear the dialog. All the other Jeremy Brett DVD sets are just fine. Otherwise the picture quality and everything else is just fine."
4,Exceptional,"The quality of the movies were. exceptional. I know Britt was very sick, I thought it was some of his best acting."
5,A 19th Century Girl Caught up in the 21st,"Fantastic! That is the word I describe Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke together in the Casebook of Sherlock Holmes. My dad and I love these series and I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to sharpen their skills of deduction. I'm speechless on how these great actors can set up a scene together and not to mention, Holmes' ablility to solve the most strangest cases England could come up with."
2,Those 'fish hook' tips....,...tear the meat and add minutes to any job requiring a non-stick fork. I have filed the barbs so that the tines are smooth. Now the fork works wonderfully.
3,Morituri,"The English language version of Morituri, as translated by David Herman, IN THE EDITION IHAVE is profoundlyfrustrating. The language it is rendered in bears only a casualresemblance to English.However, when I compared it with the excerpt which appears on the Amazon.com screen, Iwas surprised to discover that it differed in many details from the text in my book, thoughoutwardly it appears to be the same edition. Many of the linguistic absurdities had beenremoved. I had never encountered this phenomenon before, where identical editions of abook would contain such different texts, one appearing to be a ""raw"", uneditedversion of the translation."
4,"Very soft, and generously sized","These pads are larger than the standard Avent or Gerber ones, which is great for fuller-breasted women like me. They are not as thin, being that they are all cotton flannel, with no synthetic backing. These are what I use for nighttime and for being at home, since the pads will sometimes curl in the wash, making them noticeable under thin shirts."
5,Comfortable and soft,"I have used these pads when nursing my 2 children--they are soft + get softer w/ every wash! You save so much money w/ these over disposable, and they actually fit better--no creases, nothing. Best product!"
5,Perfect Mini Tripod,"This Tripod is great for the person with little or no extra space for accessories. I use it on horse back or when I'm hiking. You can set it on a Rock, Tree Stump or anywhere you like, on a flat or uneven surface. Fits into almost any pocket or a small pouch (flashlight pouch) for your belt."
2,Not so good,"The telescoping legs are a joke, they just will not hold up to the weight of even a small camera. The size is to small (without the ""telescoping legs"") to get the angles you would need for any shots.It is difficult to get it to lock at the desired angle, and the tripod will literally disassemble itself if you do not handle it carefully. This item is really not worth the money, I wish I would have spent a bit more and bought a gorillapod or similar"
3,Not half bad,"As a guy, I looked at the cover and though ""Boring girl stuff!"" But then I opened it and found for some parts I was right. ...I'm used to reading books with plotcs n stuff that are really long and have some sort of structure. Little did I know that Mandy's diary IS sort of like a story telling about all her happenings. Her poetry is really cool because she always surprises you at the end. Her short stories aren't half bad either. They have a cool twist in some of them. All in all, I thought it was a decent book. Yes, maybe something more for girls, but i enjoyed reading all the site updates. Being a web person myself I think that's another reason why I liked it..."
5,Great book for young women & girls,"While most men won't like this book (since it lacks the male humor & they wouldn't understand a girls point of view) most young girls would love this book. I read it & can understand it perfectly. My niece read the book and loved it, she could understand everything & when she shared it with her friends they were also very enlightened by this book. People need to realize that diaries have no format & sometimes appear to be poorly written, when there is no real guideline to a diary. This is a great book for young women & girls alike. I would definitely recommend this book to your sister, your daughter, your cousins."
5,great storage case,"This product has gone around the world, protecting my cards for my cameras. It has a great clip to attach it to a camera case, belt loop, keyring or etc. I love it and it works as intended, very well. Get you one."
4,Review for Tenimyu CD,Except for a small crack in the case it arrived safely and in excellent condition. Shipping and transaction were fast and reasonable price. Thank you!
3,Good only if you have a large house,"The CatGenie is a great product...if you have a big house. We have a one-level apartment and the smell of poop, which is not masked AT ALL by the CatGenie granules, emanated all throughout the apartment. The smell is so bad it makes you want to vomit. When the CatGenie is running, the smell is even worse. It frequently misses poop, so when the machine fills up with water, it's muddy poop water. And then when it dries, it smells like baked poop. We were embarrassed to have people over because of the awful smell.That being said, if you have a large house with a basement where you can put the CatGenie, it would be worth it. You never have to scoop litter. However, make sure you buy a litter mat with it because the granules will be all over your house."
1,sleeping/active mode,"My CatGenie would not turn to sleep mode after 14 hours of active mode. I called and got the first replacement unit which would NOT sense my cat using CatGenie, so I returned it. I got the second replacement unit which will not turn to sleep mode unless my cat uses it, then it turns to sleep mode without cleaning it first. When I called CatGenie the third time, they said that I have tempered with the first replacement unit and voided my warranty. I never tempered or removed any seal they were talking about. It was a bad unit which was sent to me. I have already trained my cats using CatGenie, so I stuck with it. I also stuck with the second replacement unit which won't go to sleep mood. Do anyone have the same problem with sleep/active mode setting? If so, please help me. CatGenie will not help me unless I buy another brand new unit."
1,does not work,"WE bought this product almost a year ago based on the reviews. Unfortunately, 6 months later we retuned it. It was a finicky machine that never really worked properly. We had a tough time getting our two cats to use it but once they did, the waste did not get cleaned away despite repeated cleaning attempts (we are talking almost 25+ here) the last straw was when it repeatedly went through its cleaning cycle without water and the dryer turned on blowing perfumed cat waste stink all over our house... Uck! Glad its gone. I think the company needs to work out bugs in the product before its ready for the market. Otherwise its a great concept."
1,Cat Genie - A Bad Experience,"After receiving my Cat Genie - it worked one time and quit. When we contacted the company and requested a replacement, we were told that they don't replace faulty equiptment, the just refund. They said they would send a return shipping form to my e-mail, but low and behold what I got was just an address to send it to with a note saying that if we didn't pay for return shipping, we would not receive a refund. The shipping on the Cat Genie is more than the cost which was $300.00. When we tried to contact them through the only e-mail on their website, it was returned with an undeliverable error. This is an ongoing fight but I would advise against this product and company."
1,7 hours for 2 minute installation and still not there,"The water supply line is not as long as the drain line for laundry room intallation therefore you must buy an extension at local hardware store. Even so the hose had a cracked ""non-standard"" washer and leaks from the metal connector itself. Tried to install off the toilet supply line. Fittings leaked and then the compression nut splt into 2 concentric parts. Obviously not a brass nut just brass plated. No response from my emails to customer service. Will cut off end of water supply line and repair with standard plumbing iten and replace the broken T with and standard plumbing item as well. Then I can at least see if it works."
1,GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!,"We loved the product! We have three cats, and they all took to it immediately. The Cat Genie eliminated all problems that we had been having with one of our cats eliminating outside the litter box. It is completely hands free and so easy to set up! We love it! We have tried the Litter Maid, the Litter Maid Elite, and the PetMate Purrforma Plus litter boxes. The CAT GENIE surpasses them all!!!! The only downside is the sea of plastic pellets tossed outside the box. But we were having the same problem with the cat litter, so I'd much rather have plastic pellets floating around than dukey balls any day! It also elimated the constant smell of kitty pee and doo doo that was in our house previously with the other litter boxes. Not to mention the cats love it! They had always had a fascination with our toilet, and now they have one of their very own!"
1,Never Recieved,"I ordered from SMARTHOME online using a Visa Gift card that I recieved for my birthday. They debited my card for the amount but when I didn't receive my items I contacted them. They said that they canceled the order but wouldn't give me a confirmation number or a reason as to why. They stated that I would receive a credit back to my card but that has yet to happen. I'M NOW CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE SCAMMING ME!!!Unfortunately, Visa also has customer service issues as there are no live operators to speak to when I call the number on the back of the card to dispute this purchase. The only way I can dispute this is through writing which I'll have to do but it's a pain and who knows when, or if, I'll get my money back. I will STAY AWAY FROM SMARTHOME in the future!!!!"
2,Flushing cat poop means it ends up in storm drains,"This product saves some time and effort, but there has recently been attention given to how flushed cat feces affects our environment. Specifically, certain parasites that live in some healthy cats can be passed on through the cat's feces and end up in local waterways. These parasites can kill all kinds of wildlife, especially cute sea otters![...]Our choices affect our environment, so while flushing is convenient, please remember that often what gets flushed isn't gone forever."
1,NOT FOR LONG-HAIRED CATS,I tried the Cat Genie for 2 weeks. With one cat (Ragdoll) the unit only operated without clogging once! I tried a number of fixes suggested by the customer service but none worked. The unit will stop in mid cycle and leave a bowl full of water...not a usable solution for someone who travels. I ended up spending more time and effort fixing the clog (not an enjoyable job) than I ever would have scooping it out myself. I am going back to the litter robot. Great product if you have a cat with short hair or enjoy playing endlessly in foul-smelling water. The unit does not have a sensor and only runs based on a timer...if your cat is not on a schedule you will end up running the unit needlessly. Good idea...didn't work for me.
4,"CatGenie Self Flushing, Self Washing Cat Box","This is an amazing product! We've had it for about a month and I am just now changing the SaniSolution cartridge. We live in a mobile home and so the set up was a bit tricky, however once we got it installed, I don't know how we ever did without it. We have 3 cats and the youngest one is still having trouble with the idea of using it, but in time I think she will come around. It definitely is not for the more messier poops, but it does work for the average poop. I don't particularly care much for the mix of SaniSolution and poop smell, so I just close the bathroom door when I push the button. I wish the timed setting was a bit more accurate and controllable, that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I would definitely buy again."
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE--WILL NOT HONOR GUARANTEE AS IT WOULD APPLY TO ACCESSORIES,"hi, i purchased the cat genie with great anticipation! no more changing litter cartridges every week! (2 large cats) yea!! however, after 2 1/2 weeks of tricking, coaxing, etc....my cats would not use the cat genie. boo! i loved my new cat genie! UNTIL I HAD A PROBLEM!!! contacted cat genie only to be told that my ""accessories"" would not be refunded. only the actual unit itself. but that i could try to sell the dome hood on another site myself if i wanted to. NOT!!! then i asked to speak with a manager only to be told that he was busy and would call me whenever he had time. what part of ""90 DAY SATISFACTION GUARANTEE"" does that fall under???? i am very unhappy with cat genie at this point and want to caution anyone looking to do business with this company that they do not stand behind their guarantee. i,too, am a small business owner, and would NEVER create a disgruntled customer over $34!!!!! shame on cat genie!"
2,"when it works perfectly, it is great...........","The problem is, once every 4 or 5 uses, it misses a few little pieces of poop and then proceeds to heat them up with the dryer which, as you can imagine, creates a lovely smell wafting throughout the house. There are other little issues, like the granuals getting tracked EVERYWHERE because they are so small and light, and the bowl being a little small if you have bigger cats but the real reason I'm sending it back is the constant fear of coming home to baked cat poo."
2,Save your money and use regular cat litter.,"The first month of owning the cat genie, it worked wonderful. Now we have problems with it draining. The resevoir(sp?) does not drain completely and the odor left behind is FOWL! We are still scooping out solids to minimize the odor. The sanisolution does NOT last 60 washes (40 at the most) and we take it apart quite often to clean the inside. We find ourselves doing just as much work as we were with a regular cat pan."
2,cat genie cat box,"One of the cats does not like this box at all. The other one is curious enough to at least continue to try using it. The bowl...where the cats are to 'deposit waste' is too small. The one just does not appear to feel comfortable in it. In addition, when either of them gets in, when they get out, the 'litter' follows them out and makes a pretty bad mess. I am somewhat disappoined especially with the amount of money this cost. I continue to hope that both cats will become more comfortable with this box....they have been using it for about 3 weeks.As far as cleaning, it does a nice job...IF you ensure the tube that is over the toliet area is not ""crimped"" by the toliet seat."
2,So not worth the hype.,"First lets start off with how large the unit is, it takes up quite a large space, and being in an apartment, it takes up most of the bathroom space. You need to make sure u have high water pressure other wise you will keep getting error messages like I did. I have had this item for almost 2 months (waiting to hear back from company to send it back) and probably had to tak it apart (with urine and other things filled water)and dump and restart. For what i paid, I should not have to put so much time into a device to make my life easier. Also one cat took almost right away, the other still has not, will poop everywhere around machine but not anywhere in it. If u are in for a long battle and alot of work, this is the device for you."
1,porta-potty,"This product sounded like a dream, but it really disapointed me. When cleaning, the genie will leave small bits of poo. The poo is then washed and dried. While washing, the sanitizing solution smells like a porta-potty, very gross!! On top of that, the poo is being baked with the smell of the porta-potty. I could'nt deal with the smell. Also, my cats did not take well to the genie. I tried all the things they suggested. My cats were very happy when the old litterbox returned. I would not recomend this product!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought two of these. One for myself and the other for my sister.I found out that my sister had trouble with hers from the start. It failed to drain and she was constantly having to clear the impeller. Because of this she never was able to use it in automatic mode. Customer support was not helpful in getting the thing to work for her and I learned that she gave up on it and returned to the LitterMaid litter box.The one I had was working well and my cat had adapted to it pretty easily. Recently it stopped draining, so I followed the instructions and cleaned it really well. I ran it through the cycle and it overflowed all over the bathroom floor. I then replaced the sensor that detects was level and ran it through the cycle again. It still failed to drain. I too have given up on it and have returned to the LitterMaid. If anyone is interested in purchasing the better part of a case of sanisolution let me know."
1,Cats won't use it yet,"So far, I can't get my cats to use it. I'm not emptying their old boxes and I've dumped a box of cat genie litter into their old boxes but nobody seems to want to use the new box."
3,Works as advertised... but one of my cats won't use it,"I have two cats, and one took to the box fine. The other, however, refuses to use it, and took to urinating everywhere else in the house. The plastic litter pellets are significantly different from standard cat litter - so if you've got finicky cats, watch out."
2,Great Concept but....,"This product is great...if the cats would use it. The granuals, when felt by me, left little glass-like pieces in my fingers."
4,Works as advertised,"This product works as advertised, haven't had any problem with the box, however the cleaning process scares some of the cats, have had problems with cats going where they're not supposed to. But only occasionally. Had to by dome and will buy mats when available, because they kick alot of litter out. Sometimes it doesn't catch all the poo, when that happens the smell of baked cat poo and cleaner can be quite potent. Purchased a arm&hammer air freshner to put in the cat box. So only improvements I can think of would be quieter operation, and some form of air purification. That's why the 4 stars."
4,CAT TOILET,"CatGenie-Self Washing, Self Flushing Cat BoxI love this product! I had a little trouble with the motor when I first got it, but a quick call to the mfg and I had a new motor the next day. This is easy to set up, easy to use and the mfg stands behind their product. What's not to love."
5,Great product,"I bought this before we got a new kitten (our old family cat had passed away). I set the thing up in under an hour by myself (I am a girly girl - didn't know a thing about plumbing...my father in law is tickled that I did this myself). I showed it to the kitten first thing when he came to live with us. He did number 1 within hours in it, and number 2 within a day. He uses it no problem. Not one thing has gone wrong with this product. Nothing. No clogging. Nothing. It has run perfectly and we love it. I have a high kicker so there are little beads on the floor but there would be with regular litter too."
1,Horrible waste of money - doesn't work,"I had the cat genie for 2 weeks. It was easy to set up. It worked for a total of 4 days and then the motor blew up. I had to wait 5 days for it to be replaced. It then worked for another 6 washings before breaking again. I returned the unit at my own expense ($33 shipping) and the cat genie company kept $66 of my money. Shipping doesn't cost that much. Do not waste your time or money. $100 lost for 10 uses. Back to scooping, yet glad nonetheless to be rid of the thing. By the way, the unit I bought is the newly improved version. Or so they say."
4,So Far So Good...,"Have had this litter box for few weeks now and so far so good. No problems. No random beeping. We have not set the timer. Luckly have been home enough to just press the clean button once or twice a day. The granulates DO get everywhere! Atleast they're ""clean"" right? ....except I don't know if the one I found on my nightstand was clean.... ewww..My cats still are not used to this machine yet and still like to use the (increasingly gross by-the-day) old one. Maybe its my fault for letting them see it run before they used it.Hooking it up seemed easy, My bf set it up and all is well.I think its kinda gross when it gets all flushed out into the toilet and if you don't flush it yourself right away... well.... I think I'll have to have it hooked up to the washer/dryer someday and see how that works."
3,Not for our scaredy cat,"We tried this for the 90 day money-back guarantee and we are now in the process of returning it. Our cat was miserable. She didn't like the texture of the granuals and started holding her urine/Bms to the point where we had to take her to the vet several times. I guess we were fortunate that she didn't pee/defecate in other places, but her holding it too long made her sick. The unit itself worked with no problem. It takes 40 minutes to clean and it is LOUD. The cat was very scared of cleaning cycle, so that required us to close the door the laundry room while cleaning, and then make sure we opened it back up as soon as it was done. When she urinated in it, the granuals stayed wet and in order for her to use it again, we had to keep cleaning.For us, this was a total nightmare. And the granuals were ALL OVER THE HOUSE despite getting the walls."
1,Terrible product,"The cats refused to use the product. Flooded multiple times, tech support although friendly, completely useless in fixing problems. We have uninstalled and this is now sitting in the garage waiting to be taken out with next week's trash.Major problems with flooding, fill hose was faulty. Brass t-valve for installation is poorly designed. Sensors are incapable of telling what's going on with the product.Stay away."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I love that I never have to scoop the litter. Perfect for a pregnant Mom!!! My cat is not scared of it when it runs, in fact it likes to watch!!! A few things I wish it would do: clean the scooper automatically, have more programability(it always goes off at 6:00 in the morning), and not blow the granules out of the dish while drying. Your toilet needs cleaning more often but that is the only major drawback. In spite of all of this, I LOVE my catgenie!!!"
2,Count on tearing it apart once a month,"We bought this at the beginning of the year and we were very excited when it came. However the excitement didn't last. I can't even tell you how many calls we have made to the support desk to help us fix it. We now have become experts at tearing it apart. It always gets clogged and I can't even begin to describe how disgusting it is to deal with soupy cat poop. Also, if any poop gets left behind then it gets blown with hot air and stinks up the whole house. I would not recommend buying this until they fix a few things.May 6, 2009I have truely come to hate the Cat Genie. I am 2 steps away from throwing it into the desert. I have called customer service so many times I've lost count. I have done all the upgrades, etc. And it still won't work. I would not reccommend this item unless you like dealing with smelly cat poo. Maybe I have a lemon, maybe not. Don't reccommend this product.Carol De Poy"
2,Frustrating!!!!,"Frustrating! The cycles take way toooooo long! poop remains trapped around the hand or base, the smell of the sanitizing liquid is terrible!!!I have to add some baking soda to stop the smell around. I already tried all possible litter boxes and still waiting for the magic one that may give me a brake, this one is better than the purrforma but still a pain!Too much money for such a headache!!"
2,NOT THE TOTAL ANSWER,"This machine is not the total answer for a cat box. A big problem is that the granules get scattered all over the floor, either from sticking to the cat's feet or blown out by the drying cycle. Additional thought is needed in this machine's design because the granules are not cheap to continually add.Another big problem is the smell. Even with the solution added to the granules, there is stiil quite a smell from the cat waste. It would be a wise move to have the unit turn on automatically AFTER the cat uses the box, instead of waiting for the next cycle to occur. Although the machine can be turned on manually anytime, it doesn't help when cat waste stays in the box for ANY length of time. The machine should use motion sensors to not only sense when the cat is in the box but to turn the machine ON when it leaves.Cat waste also sticks to the scoop and the machine operation should be designed to rinse it.Perhaps the designers of this machine will take some advice and improve it."
4,Litter scoup?,"This product is AWESOME! It scoups, washes and dries the litter then pumps the waste out!I've had this product for about 3-4 months and all i have to do is change the sanitizer cartridge and add litter once a month! I have only one cat and have the unit set to run twice per day.I also had the littermaid and this BLOWS IT AWAY!!! I was always cleaning the LitterMaid-GROSS!!!Cons:- a bit noisy, sounds like a washing machine only half as loud- does not automatically run cleaning cycle immediately after the cat uses it like the littermaid does.- You can set it to run 1-4 times daily. 1 = every 24 hours, 2 = every 12 hours, 3 = every 8 hours and 4 = every 6 hours. I have mine set to twice daily which means if my cats decides to go #2 just after a cleaning cycle and i'm not there to manually ""flush"" it the waste will fester there for 12 hours.if this were an automatic scouper like the litter maid i would give it 10 stars!!!!"
1,Cat Genie,"The first two weeks, I loved this product! It worked like a charm. Now it is having issues and I cannot seem to get any answers. After working so well for two weeks, I went ahead and discarded the original box it came in so I am unable to return it now. Trying to decide if I buy a whole new machine and send the old one back in the box I get with the new one. Frustrating! Really thought this would be the answer to keeping cats and still having a clean house."
1,WHAT A WASTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My husband ordered one of these machines and we rcvd it last week. I was less than thrilled but with 2 children under the age of 2 I decided to give it a chance. What a waste of money. The cleaning cycle lasts over a half hour and is loud. The sani solution which is pricey smells very strong like dollar store air freshener. oh and my upstairs bathroom gets at least 10degrees hotter when the thing is running. My cats have yet to look at the stupid thing. After reading other reviews and hearing about the clogging problems this has done it for me. This is going back after a week in my home. So not worth the $300 plus.
2,"I wanted to like it, but had to get rid of it","I wanted to like this product. I had the cat genie for 8 months before finally pulling the plug for the last time.1) Be prepared to scoop cat poop even with this bad boy. If it misses anything it will heat it up at the end of the cycle and the smell of baking poop is not pleasant. (This happened every week or so and the 40th time was the last time...we had to eat diner out it was so bad)2) Litter gets EVERYWHERE...we do not let the cats into our bedroom, but somehow handfuls of litter ended up there. I've found litter in the closet, in baking pans, in the office, etc.3) The processing unit is fairly temperamental and we are on our 3rd.That's my two cents. It a great concept, but not quite there yet."
3,Not Sure Yet,"I'm not sure yet if I love this product or hate it. I love being able to just push a button twice a day and not have to deal with a litter box. My cats (2) took to it with no problem so that's not an issue. My problems with the product are the smell, the efficiency of removing solid waste, and the mess of the granules. The smell is a very strong medicinal odor at best. At worst it's a strong smell of baked poo. The second time I ran the machine some solid waste missed the scooper, then got washed and air dried. The smell permeated throughout my house before I realized what was going on.The other issue is that the granules are small pieces of plastic. I think it's because of the weight, but the cats track the granules everywhere. I actually found one yesterday on my dining room table. Have to admit that was unpleasant."
2,review,"The thing is always clogged and when they say you don't have to buy cat liter anymore, they forget to tell you you have to buy cartridges for cleaning and a substitute cat liter that keeps getting flushed away. Bad buy don't do it!"
2,HIGH MAINTENANCE LOW PERFORMANCE,"If you have more than one cat, forget this product (I have four cats).The concept is excellent, however:1. It takes FOREVER to cycle through. By that time, the cats ""go"" on the floor because of the time it takes toclean and dry the pellets. My cats NEVER ""went"" on the floor when I had conventional litter boxes.2. The supplies are expensive and don't last long. The only place to purchase them is through Cat Genii's website.3. This is the 3rd unit we have had in just a few years. ""All"" the units have been problematic for as long as we've had them. One didn't drain at all, the replacement's water hose leaked, and the new one did not recognize the cartridges. We finally got all the bugs worked out of this latest one.4. Seems like the unit just spins and spins, seemingly not doing anything. It takes WAAAY too long to complete a cleaning cycle.I will not buy another one."
1,DO NOT BUY.,"Product works well the 1st few months, but not made well and too many moving parts.Also, what you don't know is the maintenance and up keep. Every three months the company recommends to take the unit apart and clean it. Should be easy, well it's not. Cleaning cat waste that has been sitting there for a long time took over 2 hours and the most disgusting thing I have ever done. Had to buy gloves and a mask. Not all waste is expelled through the machine so it collects and builds up into a vile putrid paste. I have called customer service 3 times over the coarse of a week, because the motor unit after cleaning will not engage. Total disaster and waste of money. Call customer service and see if you get a call back. 888-735-3927. DO NOT BUY, I would suspect the reviews are from customers that have not had the unit that long"
4,Great product if you can get your cats to use it,"I think this is a wonderful product we have had it for 6 months and have not had any problems with it. However, I have one boy who will not use it at all. When we removed access from the tradional box he found other places in the house to go. If they all would use it we would buy another and go totally litter free.We have 4 cats. 3 will use it.Pros: Touch free waste management, no oderCons: Cats will not all use it. if the power goes out in the middle of a cycle be prepared for a mess. Replacement cartriges and granules are expensive."
3,Better Editing = Better Book,"This is not a bad book, but it falls short of being a good book due to some lapses into ambiguity that I imagine are due to deficiencies in the editing process. I am sure that James Harris knows what he means, it is just a pity that it doesn't always come across with the degree of clarity that one would expect.""Intellectual Disability"" is heterogeneous 'diagnosis' that delimits an enormously diverse area of theory and practice, and no short book (such as this) can do the field justice. So, this really isn't a book for professionals working in the area; it is more a book for the interested lay person. The level of coverage, detail and the references provided simply aren't adequate for a professional level text.Nonetheless, any person who cares for a someone who accesses specialist disability services would be well advised to arm themselves with this text, and if aren't getting the services described within they should demand that they do."
1,No light in this lighted makeup mirror,"Carmen's use of the term ""lighted"" makeup mirror is a joke!. The light is about equivalent to burning a small votive candle on either side of a mirror. Do not purchase this product if you want to see what you are doing when applying makeup."
4,Perfect for laptops and not bad for music,"Given the low cost and extremely small size, these speakers do a couple of things well, and some not so well:Strengths:1) Amplifying weak laptop speakers for better presentations.2) Very small, portable, and lightweight.3) Outstanding reproduction of voice for watching TV/Movies on your laptop.4) Amplies music loud enough to be heard easily from quite a range.5) Very low cost in the portable speaker market.Weaknesses:1) Little to no bass.2) Not a great iPod/MP3 player add-on, unless size is your only concern.Overall, if you need to boost your laptop so that you can watch movies on the road a little better or give better presentations to a room, then these speakers are perfect for it and are inexpensive to boot. If you're looking for something to make your MP3 player sound great, look at upgrading to the next set up of Sony speakers (Sony SRS-T88)."
2,Not so great,"I purchased these based on a recommendation in one of my outdoor magazines. I was quite disappointed.The sound is mediocre at best. The ""megabass"" advertised on the package is a joke. The speakers are easily overwhelmed and quick to distort. Have you listened to music on a very cheap clock-radio? These are step below that.Definitely not worth the $40 I paid. I'm returning these and going back to a pair of Sony travel speakers I purchased about 15 years ago. They're larger, but sound much better.If you're satisfied with weak sound and must have something very small, these might be acceptable."
1,Say what?,"To anyone who may like these, I am sorry to learn about your hearing disability. The T33 looked like a nice little package, but I thought, ""How could it possibly sound even acceptable?"" I hoped for a Sony surprise, but it didn't happen. When I returned them later that day, the clerk asked,""Is there anything wrong with them?"" I said, ""Yeah, they suck"".She smiled and handed me a refund."
1,A terrible choice for portable audio.,"I find it hard to believe that any of the reviewers who have made positive comments have actually listened to and compared several different sets of portable speakers. If they had, they would tell you to avoid these losers.The sound is tinny, even with the amplifier on. With only .15 watts per channel, you get volume only marginally above that of a typical set of headphones just lying on the table. These might do OK if you put them on the pillow next to your head, but I suspect that you will still be disappointed.Instead, consider the Panasonic RP-SPT70 travel speakers. They are, when folded, only slightly larger than the T33s. They use four AA batteries and have 1 watt of power output per speaker. They also cost about $10 less than the Sonys.To be fair, the Sonys DO fit in just about any handbag or briefcase. And they are very solidly constructed. But this does not compensate for the poor sound quality."
1,Accessory Error,"I purchased this product and specifically wanted to use it with an AC power source. As you can see from the technical specifications, it can use the optional AC-E60A AC Adapter. (The same note is provided on the Sony web site.) That is not true. I spent a long time today with Sony support and the same answer from everyone was that, in fact, this speaker is not compatible with an AC adapter. If you want to use batteries, fine (although it did sound ""tinny""), but if you want to use an AC power source, look elsewhere."
1,No volume control? runs on batteries?,I got an iPod Nano about a month ago and wanted some speakers. I got these speakers because they were cheap and was a good company name. I got these speakers delivered 2 weeks ago and plugged them into my nano. They sounded soooooooo bad!1. no volume control2. batteries die out too quickly3. no bass4. sounds fuzzy5. cord is too short6. too small for big sound[...]
1,"Short cord, batteries needed, bad sound",Not worth the $5 I paid for them on sale at Target. The cord is so short it keeps falling off the table as I move my laptop around. It takes batteries--and gives poor quality sound.Do not recommend.
1,This is ridiculous,"Ok, after reading the multiple good reviews on Amazon i persuaded myself to buy these speakers thinking some people were just pessimistic. Ok, i got these and immediately put a pair of batteries in. These things sound absolutely awful, it goes about the volume of someone quietly talking and the sound is distorted and fuzzy, forget about any bass. Absolutely do not buy these things. Oh yeah, whoever has been rating these things as good must be working for sony or something cu these things are terrible"
4,Good overall.,"I didn't buy these speakers. I was traveling to my mother's friends house, and her daughter owned these. I wasn't sure if they were new or used, but overall they worked well. I listened to them while doing my hmework with my cheap off-brand mp3 player.These are pretty good because you can plug them into anything with a speaker input.The girl who owned it had an iPod, and when she plugged it in, the sound was much lower because she had a lock on how high the volume could go [that was set on her iPod].So if the sound is too low or high, it's the mp3 player or iPod."
4,Biblical and Practical,"In this volume, Ken Sande attempt to address interpersonal relationships from a Biblical perspective. As the title indicates, he is speaking specifically to conflict resolution. He presents a collage of insights and practical ideas aimed at all Christians. All believers are to be peacemakers and this book explains how."
3,it was good but...,great info but not what I was looking for. I needed info for my family and this is more for large groups like churches and not families.
5,Establishing peace for yourself and others,"Sande has a wonderful gift for understanding the roots of conflict, and how to respond biblically, so that you can experience peace, everyone can experience grace and God gets the glory. What is better than that?"
4,Excellent Book,This book is very helpful. It is a difficult read in that there is much to absorb in every page. Best to read in short spurts and informative for any person dealing with conflict.
5,the peacemaker,"Excellent ! It changes perspective, opens our hearts to what God's goal is to allowing conflict. He makes all things works together for your good. Read it and be changed."
5,Best I Have Read on Interpersonal Conflict Management,"This book is absolutely the best book I have read on interpersonal conflict management. Sande presents Scripture after Scripture to support his directives to diffuse disharmony among brothers and sisters in Christ. Having served as a pastor for twenty years and having seen my share of church spats, this book would have been extremely helpful years ago.I highly recommend this volume to all pastors, congregational leaders, and other believers who are seeking a biblical response to conflict in the church. The author also has a website that offers various key concepts of this book in brochure form. The church today could use more works like this one."
1,over-rated,"To call this album a masterful work of art is, to say the least, a bit over the top. There are 1 or 2 good songs (especially ""willing""), but one gets the impression the artist rushed to make this album...there seem to be lots of shortcuts here. Not recommended."
4,Great Reference,"This book was a suggested to me from a expert Speech Path. She had the 2nd edition version and found it to be a great resource that she used almost daily in her practice. I purchased this edition and I LOVE it!! I have used it quite a few times as a reference for my neurology class and as a source in papers. This book is very easy to understand and use for students. I wouldn't recommend this book to be used a ""main"" textbook in class - there it isn't quite as in depth but it does help to explain things in an easier way."
4,Great Book!,"Not only is this a great reference book, it provides information that is easy to understand."
2,Poor Textbook,This book is poorly organized and not inherently clear I would not advise that anyone purchase it unless they have to for a class...
1,how to spoil wonderful cello music,"Only buy this album if you dont mind wonderful cello music being spoilt by ""environmental sounds"". The bird sounds instead of adding to the music became a source of annoyance - one play was enough!!"
2,Not for me,"**spoiler alert**Lauren and Dale are best friends, they have sex while he's drunk, the next day he doesn't remember a thing and she's pregnant and she doesn't want to inflict her pregnancy on Dale.I didn't like Lauren. It seemed she chose the hard way by not revealing her pregnancy, but if that's her decision, why did she accept Dale courtship and love and proposal without coming clean with him at once. This was just unbelievable, I thought it was incoherent given the premises. All the misunderstanding was annoying and I couldn't feel anything for her. Dale's problem with the former girlfriend is ridiculous and it's resolved in such a simple way that you can't help from wondering what all the fuss was about.I like the ""best friends turn lovers"" plots, I like them a lot, but I couldn't get into this one."
2,Pass,"I thought it would be good, but it ended up being boring. Don't waste your money on it. I didn't even finish it."
1,Leaks and lock doesn't work,"I installed this mailbox when my new home was built. The mail is wet anytime it rains (not just damp from the mailman placing it - there is a pool of water in the bottom of the box) And, the lock constantly freezes up."
4,Amazon had best price,"Pros: Sturdy product, fast shipping, looks nice, decent price at Amazon. Con: After a month of use and only 2 rainstorms, screws on the front are rusting and dripping rust inside."
5,Security Plus!!,I wanted an attractive yet secure locking mailbox and decided on the bronze Oasis Jr with the metal post. It was easy to cement and install and I had black reflective tape numbers made so it really looks modern and architectual standing out on the road in my rural setting. I was gone for 5 days in September and there was ample room for more mail. What a great purchase this was!
5,Locking Mailbox,Product arrived as projected and was installed the next day. Quality is good and the unit functions as expected.
4,Locking Mailbox,We tested several models in our local hardware stores. This was the only model that a child's hand definately could not access. All the other locking models had open mail slots that allowed a small hand to grab items inside.Amazon was the only place that we could find this model in White.
3,Heavier Than Expected - Lock Is Faulty - Looks Nice,"I paid a pro to install this for me, and it fell off it's post, it now has a dent. The key got stuck int the lock and broke off, the spare key sticks in it too, and I fear it will break too, I'll then really be up a creek.I've used WD-40 recently to help remove the key. Checking the mail is now a stressful event :(It doesn't hold near as much as it looks like it would, because the whole top HALF is dedicated to being the 'drop slot', so it holds half of what you think it would. Even very small boxes have to be placed on my porch.I see these mailboxes all over the neighborhood, I'm not sure if mine is the same brand as the ones I see around. I bet I just got the one bad apple... Still sucks though."
4,Oasis Jr,"It is very nice. The only problem I found was that since it is square and the top is flat, the water from the rain creates little puddles. It is always dirty. If they had made the top more elevated in the middle, this would have been prevented. Also I don't know why they have too many holes on the bottom (some are for the screws, others...I have no idea). They should include something to cover them (bugs may get in). They don't include any extras screws (just the 4), by mistake we kind of wear out one of them and had no backup. Other than that, it is sturdy and the lock is easy to open."
1,Not A New Book,Please note: This is not a new book in the series but a collection of previously published books. So if you already have (1) The Inspector and Mrs. Jeffries (2) Mrs. Jeffries Dusts for Clues and (3) The Ghost and Mrs. Jeffries don't buy Mrs. Jeffries Learns the Trade.
2,Victorian England,"Who would have thought that a housekeeper for a rather bumbling Scotland Yard inspector could, as subtly as possible, be the brains behind the solution to the crimes he is expected to solve? Emily Brightwell's pleasing heroine is just this person, and, like an army commander, also manages to marshal the rest of the inspector's staff to help with her task. In this first book of the seventeen, I think, stories about the Mrs. Jeffries solved mysteries, the clever housekeeper encourages her Inspector Witherspoon to question the manner and motive behind the apparent suicide of a local doctor. Naturally, by book's end, it is Mrs. Jeffries who succeeds in uncovering the relevant clues that lead the Yard to conclude it is murder, not suicide, that did the doctor in!Other than the story's fine ""upstairs-downstairs"" descriptions and actions, there is little other history here, and we find the story a bit bland."
1,rip-off,"I feel that I have been royally ripped off and wasted $12.00 on a book I have already read. Believe me, it won't happen again as I will review Ms. Brightwell's books very carefully before I buy another. A ""0"" star rating would be more accurate."
3,hoping for more,"The price was right, but the shirt fell short of satisfying my needs. I wish the description would let you know the shirt is see through so you have to wear a sports bra or undershirt with this shirt. It's also long in the torso."
3,Not the color pictured,"I bought these because I am working on a wrap in a pretty dark teal color yarn. The size ten and a half needles in my LYS are a royal blue or bright green color and neither offer enough contrast for me to be able to see the stitches easily, so I thought this gold color would be ideal. I flipped through the sizes, to make sure there wasn't just one generic picture for all sizes. There's not, so I assumed (wrongly as it turned out) that I would get the needles pictured. Imagine my disappointment when I got the same royal blue needles I had already purchased at my LYS.The needles themselves are fine - they're standard Boye aluminum needles so I'll keep them for spare, but I'm really annoyed that I was sent a different color"
1,Don't make the same mistake I did...,"I bought this as part of a box set that came with Bach's St. John Passion and Christmas and Easter Oratorios--a great bargain (or so I thought...) The singing is very precise technically, but incredibly lifeless and dull. For example, ""Ladaumus te"" is sung as if it was an exercise in breath control and diction and the singer conveys not one iota of joy. All of the climactic moments (Gloria, Gratias agimus, Et resurrexit..) become depressingly anti-climactic as the ""choir"" (which is actually only 1 person per part) drones on, singing notes but not music. Every piece is sung in the same flat way. I *love* the B Minor Mass and I can barely stand to listen to this CD...get the Gardiner or Herreweghe instead."
2,"To cheap, should have gotten better quality tools","This was for a home project, and I was unhappy with the lever of complication on the adjustment, It seems straight forward, but you have to fine tune this tool so precisely for a good crimp it was frusturating. I highyl suggest you spend the extra cash for somehting nicer and easier to use. On a side note, it did do the job great! Just slow."
3,Tool kit seemed like reasonable level of quality,but the documentation was awful. I found it too confusing and returned the kit.
5,Great Paladin Tool,"I have used all types of crimpers. Most use proprietary connectors, dies, etc. This takes all into account and allows for adjustment on the fly to use ALL types of RCA, BNC and F-Type compression connectors. I certainly like this and will add more to the arsenal for all my guys."
3,Not a good choice for quad cable,"The tool feels well-constructed, but found it very hard to decently seat connectors on quad. I also find the design of the adjustable head destabilizes the tool somewhat. It's usable, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Meh... wouldn't buy this.,Bought this so I could mount my Zoom H2/H4n to the top of my 5DMKII -- unfortunately it's very unstable and loose in the shoe-mount. Ended up buying a more expensive version with adjustable tightening and it worked like a charm. This is a low quality option that I would not choose again.Not worth the $12 by any means. Cheap plastic and loose fit. Save yourself the hassle and buy a quality one.
4,LOOSE!,This piece does NOT fit snugly in the shoe-mount. If you don't want your equipment falling apart when you lean forward don't buy this!
2,I gave it a shot...,"Well, I know it's not designed for this, but I bought it to mount my Zoom H4N to my Canon 7d. I didn't work so hot. But after some creative engineering, I got it stay put."
2,wrong album to screw,"man if u dont know who street military is then u aint a fan of texas rap!!!! street military is the best and most underrated group to ever come from texas they were spittin $hit back in like 93 before most of these new dudes even hit the scene. the reason this cd doesnt work is because that album is so old and their type of music is already kind of slow moving and no songs on there were made to be screwed. people think that u can just screw anything and make it good, thats not true u gotta have the right type of song. and to that dude that said the military aint tight he probally never even heard of em before this cd. theyre more of a hardcore group talkin about real problems and $hit not ballin with platinum teeth. if u want to hear sum classic texas underground pick up the original album and get their new one its the $hit!!!!"
2,dont waste your money,"Well im a big Swishahouse fan and me bein from TX, i love that dirty south hip hop. So i saw this album and it had the name swishahouse on it so i picked it up thinkin that it was a swishahouse classic joint. but when i heard it i was very dissapointed. Some of the songs have bad quality. I wasnt feelin any of the music on this CD. dont get me wrong, Ron C from swishahouse chopped and screwed this album nicely, but u gotta remember, the music is from a group called Street Military, and they aint that tight. So i suggest if your gonna buy an album, stick to the swishahouse Ok."
5,"Good delivery service, rapid and in good 'shape'","I have received, in my case a book, in an space of time shorter than what I expected and in good conditions."
1,MADE IN CHINA,"MISLEADING. Product may function adequately, but I found it by searching for scissors specifically ""made in USA."" I do *not* dislike the Chinese people - I wish them well. However, I do begrudge our leadership for very stupid choices that have cost American jobs and destroyed our standard of living. I try to buy American made for the sake of American jobs. Returning these."
5,Lots of R Brown goodness...,Photos of many of Roger Brown's painting that I had not seen before. This was a gift for a serious student of Roger Brown- and he loves the book.
4,Large print Bible,My mother who has macular degeneration has found this bible much easier to read. Good report I personally have not reviewed it
5,The best album from a great band,"A great album from beginning to end. Every song has all the classic Roxy moves. Standout songs are ""Love is the Drug,"" ""Both Ends Burning,"" ""She Sells"" and ""Sentimental Fool."""
3,"Book: ""Morning in Kansas"" 1952","This is an historical novel set in 1930-40s in thinly-disguised Manhattan, KS (New Boston), author Kenneth Davis' hometown (& mine). It was interesting to me from my personal connection & not a bad plot. I understand the book was controversial in it's day in Manhattan, in the sense of Sinclair Lewis' ""Main Street"". I didn't feel it was derogatory toward characters or location, but I thought Mr Davis was unnecessarily wordy."
3,Good Storage for Photo Flash Memory,I have used these for a few years to store SD flash media for my Nikon D80 camera and they work well because they can be hooked to a belt loop or to a camera case. Unfortunately the product for the CF flash media requires the use of a plastic sleeve into which the CF chip is inserted. I think the product would be better if it were designed to fit the CF chip exactly and thus eliminating the need for the sleeve like the SD version of the product. The need for the sleeve caused me to rate the product lower.
3,Also check out Pacific Laser Systems PLS2,"A laser cross is a really useful tool, and I was considering the various Gizmo models until I found the smaller, lighter, PLS2 Palm Laser from Pacific Laser Systems. It costs a little more than the cheapest Gizmo model, but the PLS2 has a 1/4"" (camera tripod) mounting thread instead of 5/8"". That means I can use the PLS2 with my existing camera tripod, whereas with the Gizmo I would need the Laser Pole to use it, and that just becomes one more bulky piece of equipment to store in my house. If CST/Berger made a 5/8""-to-1/4"" adapter to allow you to use the Gizmo on a standard camera tripod I might have bought the Gizmo, but they don't."
5,Fun read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Its a story about three generations living under the same roof- female perspective. Interesting to read about English lower-middle class life and tribulations. Had seen the tv movie based on this story and loved it. But after reading the novel, I love this story even more. Well done Kate Long. After posting this review, I'll be purchasing her other novels!"
5,Talented & Brilliant!!!,"This is one of the best cds for an introduction to a variety of songs from the great Kenny Burrell. This collection begins from the very beginning of his career in 1956 and features many of his well-known songs from the 50's and the 60's. But don't count Kenny out! He is still making cds even as we listen! One of the finest jazz guitarists of the last and present century, Kenny Burrell is hot!"
4,I AM BEING GENEROUS,"I AM A TRUE FAN OF 70'S AND EARLY 80'S BLACK TV SHOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING IS # 2 ON MY ALL TIME FAVORITE LIST RIGHT UNDER ""GOOD TIMES"" WHICH IS #1.......... I MUST SAY THIS, HOWEVER IS NOT THE BEST SEASON THOUGH IT'S JUST THAT I LOVE CLASSIC TV.......... HERE IS A SECRET I LEARNED WHENEVER SOME IS ADDED OR TAKEN AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL CAST- THE SHOW IS CANCELED AT THE END OF THAT SEASON OR AT THE BEGINING OF THE NEXT SEASONHERE'S MY CASE:1. ""227"" SANDRA LEFT: SHOW CANCELED2. ""GOOD TIMES"" MOTHER LEFT (ALTHOUGH SHE CAME BACK BREIFLY)SHOW CANCELED3.""GIMME A BREAK"" 3 GIRLS LEFT: YOU GET THE POINT4. ""SANFORD AND SON"" REDD FOXX LEFT: ""KAPUT""I AM BEING VERY GENEROUS BY GIVING 4 STARSTYRONE JOHNSON"
3,"Hey, Hey & Hey Hey!","Season 3 was the last season of the series. Mama has left the show, Shirley now resides in the Thomas home with Dee, and Raj and Rerun has their own apartment. Though ""What's Happening"" is my favorite show of the 70's besides ""Good Times"", I don't recall many of the episodes being as funny as the first two seasons. The jokes became kind of stale and some of the episidoes with the characters ""Big Earl"" and his son"" became boring once they became regulars on the show. I think the producers made a BIG mistake by adding them to the cast. I believe that the show was just as good with the original cast. But still in all, What's Happening will always be a favorite classic of mine."
5,Season 3 got the highest in ratings,"Just for the information, Season Three (September 1978 - April 1979) was the highest in it's rating reaching 28th by oudience size out of the best 30 TV shows.In 1978 Raj and Rerun graduated from High School and moved into a shared apartment nearby. While Raj Entered College and rerun went to work. Their new neighbors were Big Earl (Police Detective) and his son Little Earl.Six years after the 3rd season the show returned with a new name ""What's Happening now"" with most of the original cast.I hope they will release ""WHAT'S HAPPINING NOW"" show so we can have all of the 1980's seasons too. Thanks."
2,You can do better,"I purchased this item because I wanted to see suggested fingerings for some of the Mozart sonatas. The review says ""The pieces include fingerings "". This is not exactly true. About a 3rd of the easier pieces have fingerings; the harder ones do not. The size of the music is large print, which is good for baby boomer eyes, but the quality is very poor and inconsistent from piece to piece. Smudged and blurry in places. The binding is of the type which, with a little use, will probably break into pieces. If you like this kind of challenging piano music, spend more on quality and don't buy this 'low budget' (i.e. low quality) product."
4,Not Comfortable,"The Good-- Made in USA, large casters, easy to clean, durable, low to the ground.The Bad-- very uncomfortable head rest (hard ribbed pattern- picture on Amazon doesn't show this), hip ""bone"" area not wide enough (doesn't allow legs to straighten out, knees must remain up- I'm 5'10""). If these two problems were corrected (wider at leg area and smooth/softer headrest), this would probably be one of the best/most desirable creepers available.Update:After using this creeper for awhile, I am happier with it. As far as the moulded black head rest thing- I just put my head at the opposite end of the creeper. Not being very wide at the caster towers doesn't seem to bother me as much now either, so I have changed my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars."
3,You won't fall asleep under your car while on this creeper!,"The ""head rest"" is anything but a ""rest"", it hurts! The creeper works great, it's low to the ground and will roll over stuff that will stop other creepers. But the head rest is terrible; also, occasionally you will want to put your head on the upper pedestal/""dogbone"" areas but the bolt heads that hold the wheels are right there, ouch #2! I'm going to modify mine by tearing off the existing head rest and gluing some foam there and on top of the dogbone pedestals too. If you are over 6' tall you may want to consider something else; your hips must be above the lower dogbone and if you're too tall your head will hang off the end."
5,Best Creeper Ever!,"This is the ultimate creeper! It's hugh wheels roll over almost anything without effort. The ergonomically designed ""Bone"" is very comfortable and is the lowest platform to the ground that I have ever used. I make my living as a mechanic and have for the past 15 years and will never buy another creeper other than the Bone as long as I need a creeper.Thanks Dale Adams for such a truely ""worth the money"" product.Klint."
4,Best Rolling,Rolls better than anything I have ever used. Now i can fetch a tool without a major effort to roll out and get it. The only problem is that it rolls so easy that if something needs lots of torque the creeper rolls when i try to apply it.
3,dogbone creeper,The creeper is a little cramp and the head rest is hard and not replaceable. Cramp your legs. I would not buy again. Look at one some place and try on before buying. The wheels do not look that good. Pressed togeter like any of the cheap creepers. Too much slop in wheels.
5,Doom of the the Highest Order,"Out-of-print, almost unavailable, this record crushes almost anything else in the metal genre. Sample the track ""Age Eternal"" wherever you can find it--it's amazing!Then order this CD fast--they aren't making anymore! [Middian was sued into nonexistence by a band with a similar name--a travesty.]"
2,Not As Good As You Might Think,"I bought these speakers specifically because I bought the Sony Vaio computer system they were designed for. The Sony Vaio computer has 3 speaker inputs for: front, rear and center/subwoofer. The speakers have never lived up to expectations. Sony's own software test for the speakers failed every test - as in hearing sound coming from the speaker the sound is supposed to come out of: front, rear, etc. It's easy to connect all the speakers as long as you know which speakers get connected to which input on the back of the computer. I had no problem connecting them. I did have a problem with the sound quality. The subwoofer kicks only when the low end of whatever you're listening to is overwhelming - like a big explosion or something like that. Other than that they sound cheap and tinny with almost no bottom end at all. I have to say I regret buying them but since Sony Vaio machines are designed for Sony peripherals only, what choice so you have. None, I guess."
5,Wonderful!!,This is a wonderful book! It has a very good sense of humor. It is slightly sad and romantic. I would recommend this book to anybody!
4,Gather your Guns,"This is the Las Vegas Story.A perfectly balanced album of blues/country alt rock, one of the best albums released by the Gun Club featuring the beautiful vocals of the late Jeffrey Lee Pierce, and Kid Congo Powers (The Cramps, Nick Cave & Bad Seeds).This album rocks the whole way through, it's something that you can really let you're hair down too (even though I don't have any), the first song here is Walkin' With The Beast which is fuelled with guitars, it gives you the general feeling of the entire album, and finishes with the country flavours of Secret Fires which is a fitting finale and shows some roots to their music.The album reaches it's pinnacle with The Master Plan & My Man's Gone which suits the title of this album to a tea, incredibly loungy something you would expect to hear at 5am, after a bender, walking through a casino lounge to go home.But I suppose that was the intended effect."
3,My fault,This item was the wrong size. Grandchildren grow. She liked the style. We will see how good the return policy is.
4,sexxy,these are flat but there is somethng sexxy about them i may even get another color. If youre considering it buy them
3,Way to big!,"I'm anywhere from a 7.5 to an 8. I bought the 8 and they were way to big! I have slightly wider feet and the width was good, but the length was way too long! I had to return these."
1,A let down,"They were a disappoint. When the shoes came I was completely excited, but they were damaged so I had to return them. And since my size was no longer available I just completely gave up on them, I saw no purpose in being let down again..."
5,I love Minnetonka boots,"I LOVE THESE BOOTS !!! I bought them to complete a Native American outfit for a special event. But now I wear them with everything - long and short skirts, and jeans. They are soft and comfortable. They are sized correctly...I wear a 7, and bought the 7. They are fine with thin trouser socks, but if you are going to wear them during colder months, I would suggest buying a 1/2 size larger to allow room for heavier socks."
3,"cute, but returning","These boots look cute on,but they take a loooong time to put on and once they are on...they are on. Too much work to take on and off. Sadly I feel like I won't wear them much for this reason, but I'll be returning them. also, i think they may stretch with wear. Bought my regular size and they fit comfortably, but slightly loose. If they stretch will be too big."
4,honest review,"my package came on time and in orginal box. the shoe it self is stylish. i have had mine for all most a year, they still look new. with good care it will last. true to size . my one and only poblem is that depending on the way you walk , the heel of the boots may rub."
5,Minnetonka Women's Front Lace Boot,"These boots were very comfortable and well-made. Seemed true to size and arrived very quickly. They were bought for a teenage granddaughter, who wears them with 'skinny' jeans and long skirts, and thinks they are very stylish (she likes Indian/frontier-type clothing)."
4,Doesn't fit so well,This hand made boots didn't fit so well. Actually left feet is bigger than right one. The touch of leather is different.
1,so bad.the eyelet of this shoes have not be opened,"So bad. the eyelet of this shoes have not be opened, and i have to punch eyelet for this shoes. I am very angry, why did you sell this low quality shoes? Why didn't you check it before shipping?"
4,solid thrid album,"this is a good album, with definite growth and maturity evident in the band. but this growth has been more towards a Folk influence, which although i like and am growing into, definitely dont enjoy as much as their prior stellar rock angle. preview the tracks and if it's your style, this is an amazing album. otherwise, if you havent already, pickup TSTCTC's second album: Mander Salis. it's amazing"
4,Hear this album before you die!,"Some people want to climb a mountain. Others wish to skydive. Still others choose to attempt writing a novel. All of these life-accomplishments are trivial in comparison to the pursuit of truly great music.The Snake The Cross The Crown is simply THE best band you've never heard. Take acoustic, ""Meddle""-era Pink Floyd, some of the best folk-melancholia of early Counting Crows, and add some truly original songwriting that defies comparison. One trip across this record and you will be unable to remove it from your CD player. I can only hope we hear more from these boys, and soon."
3,Ipod case,"My concern is that sometimes the IPod turns on while it is in my briefcase. When it does so, the battery runs down. If the case were stronger, perhaps the IPod would not turn on by itself regularly. The 20 G Ipod that I purchased is an earlier version than the 2 G Nano that it is replacing (to give me the ability to store more complete opera recordings). The Nano is a superior product and stronger, but Wagner's Ring alone takes half the memory. If I were purchasing a case again, I would try a stronger case -- but I don't know whether I would still have the problem. The Kensington protects the Ipod from damage, but it doesn't protect the battery from running down when no one but my briefcase is listening.Reminds me -- time to charge the battery again.Alan Fisher"
4,Nes for cat genie use,"Recently started using for my 5 cats. As far as the granuals go, I have found that I am using about 1 box per month, which is more than the product descriptions note. However, I do have 5 cats! I really do wish they would make it so it doesn't track so much! That is my biggest beef with the system."
5,No more litter! Ever!,"I love the CatGenie. The washable, plastic granules are one of the best things about the CatGenie. You'll never have to buy litter again! It doesn't make any dust! Zero! The granules are big enough to pick up off the floor. They're big enough to sit on top of a carpet or rug, and not get ground in. They look kind of like someone took a big piece of plastic spaghetti and chopped it up - it's kind of oval-shaped, so it won't roll around on the floor, and the sides are flat. They are much easier to clean up off any type of floor than regular cat litter. It's wonderful!"
3,Cheapest ANYWHERE!!,"And great free shipping.Costs about as much as regualr cat litter.It does get all over, even with the dome.Keep a dust eater/dirt devil small portable vacuum nearby."
4,"It works, but is over priced",It is a required consumable of the cat genie - you will loose more graduals from being tracked around the house then lost down the toilet - the cost of the little plastic pellets is actually ridiculous - but what cha going to do - if anyone has found a generic substitute please post it!. The cost is still a bit less than scoopable litter.
3,"Very expensive, but what can you do",The box of granules is very over priced. But you need it for the catgenie so you don't have any other choices.
2,Could I get a refund for the Cat Genie?,I'm not talking about the granules here. The Cat Genie itself was a major disappointment. It would not drain out in the drain behind our washing machine even though the hose was not stopped up. We tried cleaning it and still the mess stayed underneath the bowl. NOTHING WORKED! I would very much like to get a refund for the $280.00 that I wasted. I would be happy to send it back!Pamela D. Robinsonprobi49779@insightbb.com orpamelarobinson32948@gmail.com
3,cat geni granules,great price fast service and delivery. cats track the granules all over the house fyi.
1,Product - okay. Shipment packaging - terrible.,"About 25% of the granules had spilled not just out of the original container but also out of the shipping box used by Amazon. Really sloppy handling and packaging! When you add the cost of the lost granules to the high cost of the product, the end result is exorbitant!"
5,Sometimes the orignal is the best,"I have two cat genies so I am always trying find ways to cut costs, so I have tried many of the after market brands of granules, and although they work, they just don't work as well as the original. Just wish I could get them in a biiger quantity and for a lower price."
4,Tracks easily...,"So I got extra washable granules because my cats track their litter, no matter what kind, EVERYWHERE. These are no different. And worse, because when you happen to step on them it pisses you off. I dont know how to prevent the cats from tracking their litter though. I did buy a dome and maybe that will help. But over all, as washable granules, they do their job. They actually look very clean against the cat genie box, and it is the only granules you can use with a cat genie."
3,Granules could be bigger,"You'll still have ""litter"" everywhere in the house...I think if the cat granules were bigger they wouldn't stick to the cat's feet and get carried everywhere, but I suppose, overall, it's better than regular litter...."
4,Works for me,"Since this is the only litter you can use with the CatGenie, it has to be OK. It does get all over the place, but works as advertised. The CatGenie people say that the granules are bio-degradeable and I certainly hope so. At least two tablespoons of the things end up getting flushed.Amazon had the best price, plus a great deal where you buy 3 and get an additional one free. The only way to go."
4,Good Deal for a necessary product.,I am unable to find these in stores so online is my only choice. Overall I like them much better then litter!
5,Very pleased customer from Arkansas.,"I have only one thing to say .Just wonderful . I have only one cat,He does track some of the granules out of the box,But it is still better than the clay.If you are thinking about buying the Cat Genie Don't worry .You will be so glad that you made the purchase. I was.And it was so easy to put together too. patricia in Arkansas."
5,Good stuff:),"These granules are easy to clean up, but they do scatter, just like regular litter. You run low on your granules because a lot of them are actually washed up under the rim of the catgenie, during the cleaning process. They are working to rectify this problem."
4,Brooklyn-Detroit -German Style Tech. in 1 CD,"I bought this cd when it was new in 2001 and it showed me that Frankie, Adam, and Heather have vast knowledge of connecting classic techno with the new to make something entirely creative. It has a dark feel to it and defines a twisted sound that most celeb DJ's in shy away from. The mix tells it's story through a beat mix that pounds at a steady pace at about 120-125bpm. In other words, it's slow and deliberate vibe captures the dark side of techno very well."
4,Entertaining and fun - no commitment required!,Very short stories by very creative writers. they don't take a ot of commitment to read them and provide a nice taste of each author. I liked all of the stories and found myself wanting to read more like them by the authors. A great way to test drive authors you don't know and see who suits you. This book had so much creativity and fun!I did find myself somewhat embarrassed about carrying it around with the cover art - but I got over it! pick it up!
5,Short But Sweet!!!!,"I have to admit I love short stories but sometimes I wish the authors could develop the characters better. Well these authors do just that. Each story is different with a twist that makes you keep reading and characters to fall in love with. I am not going to discuss these stories because I am sure some other reviewers will spoil them for you, but at least I'll know it wasn't me. Just remember I told you the stories are great, the romance wonderful, the sex terrific and the mysteries intriguing. When you finish the book you won't be able to stop thinking about what you just read."
3,Fire and ice,"To Patricia,You may want to know that FIre and Ice is actually a sequel to the book Born of Night. You wonder about the mom and dad and in Born of Night it tells their story.MM"
2,"very difficult to install,","before you install this look at the car and realise there is a steel bracket blocking the bolts from being removed from the MAF, making this unusable"
4,MAS adaptor,"the holes did not match up but i did not honestly expect them to. the metal was easy enough to drill holes trough the only problem is you'll have to consider the mounting bolts (on my car Lexus gs300 it was part of the plastic piece that holds the old air filter and does not come off) but luckily i had spare and you can just go to local parts stores to mount it. i used this with an AEM dryflow filter (the long one, 9 inches and fit fine). i did like the hole with rubber grommets for those who can utilize it.the only negative thing i can think of is the opening is round and on the mas housing it is rectangle so there is a slight reduction of air coming into the intake - but it shouldn't really make a difference the filter i put on should make up for any loss over the stock system. and the plastic spacer was useless on my application but may be useful in others (with a smalle mas)+so do not forget: 1 drill, 4 nuts + bolts, filter with worm clamp or better clamp."
4,Great watch. Extra large band.,"This watch looks good and, of course, keeps extremely accurate time. Instead of making a point of leaving it near a window between midnight and 4:00 a.m. to allow it to get the time automatically, I cause it to get the time manually when I think of it each day or whenever. I put it on a table near a window on my patio table, press a button, come back in 8 to 10 minutes, the time has been synchronized to Fort Collins. I would have given it 5 stars, except the pins in the band are not easy to remove (they are solid and must be pushed out using a special tool), so you'll need to take it to a watch shop to get the EXTRA LARGE band made smaller. I have HUGE wrists. No big deal; it cost me $8.00."
4,GREAT WATCH - BUT,"I LOVE THIS WATCH. I WAITED UNTIL I OWNED IT FOR SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE WRITING THIS RERVIEW. IT KEEPS GREAT TIME AND BY LEAVING IT NEAR A WINDOW AT NIGHT, IT CALABRATES WITH FT. COLLINS. UNLIKE THE AUTOMATIC WATCH I PREVIOUSLY OWNED, IT DOESN'T STOP. THE EARLY MORNING SUNLIGHT IT RECEIVES NEAR THE WINDOW IS SUFFICENT TO KEEP IT WORKING WELL. I WOULD HAVE RATED IT FIVE STARS EXCEPT FOR ONE FACTOR. THE SMALL WINDOW NEEDED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IS DIFFICULT TO SEE. I LOST THE MANUAL AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADJUST TIME CHANGES ( THE WATCH DOES THIS AUTOMATICALLY BUT ONLY ON THE DAY AFTER YOU GO FROM DAYLIGHT TO STANDARD TIME)AND TIME ZONE CHANGES. I ASSUME THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE INFO FROM CASIO. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MANUAL IS NOT IN AMAZON'S DIGITAL LIBRARY. I PAID $80 FOR IT ON AMAZON AND IT IS A STEAL AT THE CURRENT PRICE. IF IT WAS EASIER TO READ THE INFO IN THE WINDOW, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN RATED A 5 EVEN AT THE HIGHER PRICE THAT I PAID."
1,the worst thing I have bought from Amazon,"I bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch - for swimming and running. Unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming, is unbelievably bulky, and has this strange time setting system which only works in the USA and Europe (I live in Australia). In the end I gave it to a relative in the USA,"
3,Also check out Pacific Laser Systems PLS2,"A laser cross is a really useful tool, and I was considering the various Gizmo models until I found the smaller, lighter, PLS2 Palm Laser from Pacific Laser Systems. It costs a little more than the Gizmos, but the PLS2 has a 1/4"" (camera tripod) mounting thread instead of 5/8"". That means I can use the PLS2 with my existing camera tripod, whereas with the Gizmo I would need the Laser Pole to use it, and that just becomes one more bulky piece of equipment to store in my house. If CST/Berger made a 5/8""-to-1/4"" adapter to allow you to use the Gizmo on a standard camera tripod I might have bought the Gizmo, but they don't."
5,Brilliant!,"Musicianship is flawless. The recordings span several sessions and years, but the consistency is great and the sound quality is wonderful.Great discs."
1,Damaged Parts,what's not damaged looks nice; cannot assemble because one of the cross middle bars is very damaged; not surprising since the packaging was falling apart when it arrived; very disgusted
5,Best Toddler bed Ever (Stork craft soom soom toddler bed)!!,"We purchased this bed for my daughter in Dec. 2011. This is the best toddler bed, my husband and I both were pleased with it. It was packaged nicely (no broken pieces), but most of all it is sturdy!! My daughter who is 3 and is a big 3 yr old for her age LOVES it! Not to mention it took the mattress from her baby bed so that's a bonus. If you are looking into buying this bed for your toddler, you won't regret it!"
1,Missing Pieces and damaged.,"I purchased this specifically to match the current furniture in my son's room when we replaced his crib (due to recall of the company). The price was right, and it looks great in the pictures. When the bed arrived I noticed the box was really beat up. I opened the box and found that I only recieved the headboard, footboard (it was damaged) and the 2 side rails. I was missing all the screws the 2 guard rails and the 6 slats. Because I am missing more than 50% of the parts, Storkcraft will not mail me the missing parts, I have to return the bed thru Amazon. I will be returning and I will not buy this brand again."
2,Overpriced!,"I purchased a toddler bed that looks just like this one a few years ago for my middle child from a discount store for around $60. I regretted the purchase as the assembly was a bear and the quality of the wood was poor. So this time, I upgraded to a name-brand bed thinking that I would get a better product... not the case! I wish I'd saved $30 and bought a less expensive bed again. In addition, it took Amazon a LONG time to ship the bed to me and when it arrived the box was damaged.It's a super cute bed and is going to work just fine for our needs."
3,"Ok, here is the real deal","We looked all over for a toddler bed that was sturdy and safe but not crazy expensive. I think this one fit the bill for us. It is cute, the color was true to the picture and the set up was pretty easy. The slats underneath fit fine. I think people ran into issues because they don't become fully situated until you attached and tightened both the head and foot boards. There was a bit of the odor when I first opened the box, probably the finish on the wood, but I aired the bed for a couple of days in the garage and it was fine. My kiddo loves this bed and while you are not supposed to put an adult on it, I have sat on it with my 2 year old and it held up just fine ( I'm about 135lbs). I think this is a pretty good choice for the $. Good luck!"
5,Great Toddler bed,"I bought two for my 3 year old twin girls. These beds are easy to assemble, my husband assemble them,it took him less than an hour to assemble both beds. Beds look very nice and the girls love them.!!!"
2,Chemical smell,"I felt obligated to write this review because I wished I knew what I know now before purchasing this bed. This bed has a strong chemical smell. The smell was strong enough to make my throat itch. As soon as we opened the packaging, we immediately noticed it. We tried airing it out in the garage for a day, which helped a little, but the smell was still there after we brought the bed back in. It got gradually better after a week, but I could still smell it when reading my child a bedtime story. I know the finish is supposed to be non-toxic, but after doing some research online (and finding many similar reviews where people had problems with the smell), I have not found any information on VOCs. I returned it and exchanged it with a similar bed by DaVinci, which did not smell at all. So if you are trying to decide between the two, here's your answer. Otherwise, the bed is beautiful and sturdy, and so is the DaVinci one. DaVinci Sleigh Toddler in Cherry"
2,Bed arrived scratched,"I have ordered this bed as I was looking for something better than the cheapest option on WalMart.To my surprise, the quality of it is really low, the wood was scratched, and it seemed like it was a used product."
5,The Perfect Little Bed!,"In anticipation of our second baby we purchased this transition bed for our toddler (26 mo.). It is a sturdy bed, great construction. The color matches perfectly with previous furniture. After doing a lot of comparison and research we settled on this bed because the reviews were stronger as far as shipping, assembley, parts, and construction. It was no hassel to put together. We are very happy with our choice and our little guy transitioned to his ""big bed"" with no problem. I would highly recommend this product!!"
1,Horrible assembly instructions,Horrible instructions force me to give this a 1 star rating. I had to figure out most of the things myself after a do-over. Very frustrating. The finished product looks ok but does not seem to be very sturdy. I also had couple of ill-fitting bolts for which I will be reaching out to the manufacturer on Monday
5,Sturdy Bed,Love this bed. I tried putting it together by myself at first but frustration took over and my husband had to help. It is really sturdy and a great price too.
4,bed,Great bed for my near two year old. It was s very simple and easy to put together. My daughter loved it.
3,Not easy to assemble but very cute,"This bed didn't come in the best condition; some of the pieces had marks and scratches on it, but since it was already my second bed I ordered, I was just thankful it didnt arrive cracked and kept it. It was QUITE annoying to put together, it took me over an hour as there is nothing to hold the bottom slats in place. However, now that its all together, it does look quite cute. I'm a little concerned that the bed rails are a little too short in height and length, but time will tell."
3,Nice bed once you get it put together,"Assembly: This bed was very frustrating to assemble. The instructions were very vague and less than informative, as it was picturegrams only.However, once we finally got it put together, it looks very nice and should be a great bed for my daughter to grow in for awhile."
5,Daughter LOVES it! Great Product!,"We bought this bed after a lot of toddler bed research. My husband wasn't going to put our daughter in just any bed, so we spent many hours researching different brands and styles. This is the one we chose and we are so glad we did. It went together so easily! Its very sturdy and looks great! Our daughter is so excited with her new ""big girl bed""! I would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Good Value, quality product","I was worried because it seemed very inexpensive, but it just turned out to be a really good value. It is holding up well, even with our 2 year old jumping up and down on it all the time. He loves it and sleeps well in it. The only down-side was putting it together. The instructions weren't as clear as they could have been. Also, it takes a little bit of creativity to get the slats that hold up the mattress in place. Once it is assembled it is an excellent product at an excellent price."
5,"Looks like Kreator's got some competition for the ""Best German Band"" award!!","This album is, quite simply, one of the best, if not THE best, tech-death albums you'll ever hear. Muhammed Suicmez is a killer growler, his growls are comprehensible and his lyrics are very intelligent. He is also one awesome guitarist, he plays lightning fast, and solos with the second guitarist, and - no lie - THE BASSIST SOLOS TOO!! All three mix together perfectly. Oh yeah, and we can't forget the drummer, he is fast and on beat, just like Dave Lombardo (Slayer) and Pete Sandoval (Morbid Angel).This album is fast paced, starting with ""Stabwound"", then slows down a bit for ""The Stillborn One"", but then gets speedy again through the rest of the tracks. There are no standout tracks because they ALL rock, so no skipping is necessary here.If you don't have this, be sure to obtain it. One thing's for sure: I can't wait for this band's next release."
5,WICKED!,"This is, in my opinion, the craziest metal album ever. The musicianship is unbelievable. Every member is practically a virtuoso at his instrument. The technicality is mindblowing. What can I even say."
2,already overrated,"Please, people, can we have a little objectivity here? Firstly, this band is about as original as ice on the north pole. Did anybody mention Morbid Angel yet...or Chuck Schuldiner's Death? So their stuff is a bit more on the technical side but rarely is there a memorable riff. The vox are your generic cookie monster style but the drumming is pretty good. On the whole this thing isn't outstanding in any way. Songwriting is rather messy with a distinct carelessness for arrangement - these songs lack point and purpose. Nothing groovy or blasting to bang your head to; barely interesting for music theorists though - to keep them counting all those crazy (rah rah) odd time signatures. Yawn."
2,...nothing amazing.,"after hearing tons of hype for this album...i finally decided to hop into my car and head to the local sam goody in my shopping mall to pick it up....i'm sorry, but why is this good? i could listen to this all the way through and still not be able to decipher one song from the next due to the guitar riffs. the ""technical"" playing is simply keyboard esque guitar riffs over and over and then over again on every single song.the vocals are pretty decent, but nothing that made me stand up and take notice like Barnes did on Tomb Of The Mutilated.my lasting reflection on this cd is that it's a good buy if you've not yet experienced great death metal and want something a little more...dare i say it?...""commercial"". At the end of the day, it's pretty much what i expected. A overhyped/marketed death metal album that certainly DOES belong in Sam Goody...right next to Hot Topic in my local mall....is this a bad thing? not entirely. That's why i gave it two stars."
4,One of the best death metal albums since 2000.,"'Deminished To b' is one of the best death metal songs I've heard. The outro at the end is wicked. The guitarist is insane. The quick transitions in time are impossibly technical. I sure wish I could see them live, but they've never ventured past New England. Hopefully they'll tour in May. I'm glad Nile decided to tour this year. Their song, 'Lashed to the Slave Stick' is speed metalist maximus. Great music for the kids."
4,I like this artist,"En lo personal, la música de Ricardo Arjona me gusta mucho. este DVD contiene los videos originales de las canciones que hicieron de este cantante, un artista de un gran nivel. Los videos son tal y como fueroin grabados en aquel tiempo asi que no esperes de ellos una calidad de imagen super pero si eres fans es una pieza muy buena para tu coleccion de discos."
2,Arjona,"This video is a video clip, I want to watch a concert. It's for this reason I don't liked but,if you like the video clip is a good choice. Because the songs are the best of Arjona. Please be more specific in the product description."
2,They shouted out with glee!,"The idea was a good one: surf music versions of Christmas songs. But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like ""real"" surf music. Probably because ""The Wave Benders"" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic ""surf music"" versions of Christmas songs."
3,A mixed blessing,I found the first record to be wonderful but the second was not to my taste. Perhaps this is because I am firmly embedded in the 50s when I was 13.
4,Better than your usual party favor,"Zestra has been the only sexual enhancer for women that I have found to actually be effective. After reading a review in Red Book, I found the product to do what it promised. Over the years, I have given samples to many patients, and their response has been pretty positive across the board. No one has had irritation from it; and it works well, but only for women.I always find it amusing when a product lives up to its advertising, and this one does. My only complaint is the rather steep price."
5,Nice product,"Yes the smell is not perfect but my husband did not mind it at all. It lasts for 45 mins and washes off pretty well after that time, it doesn't last for days as another writer mentioned. It is great for menopausal dryness and helps to arouse you when you aren't really feeling like it and enhances orgasm. I LOVE IT and am buying another package and will recommend to any woman. Don't use an entire package though, tear it open a bit and put only a few drops on, that's enough. Don't taste it! blah... nice that its all natural. Didn't irratate me and I am allergic to almost everything even a lot of natural oils."
3,Product as ordered not sent,"We ordered a o.8 mil bottle of Zestra. We have been enjoying the product greatly, but wanted the spray bottle listed.Instead, we were sent 3 packets of single use.No contact was ever made about this disappointing switch.The Zestra is good."
4,More digital please,"The information and the pictures in this book are first rate. I learned more than enough to justify the cost of the book. The pictures are very good at illustrating the qualities of good garden photography. My only question is the same as one of the other reviewers, why are there not more digital photographs? The author professes to shoot digital almost exclusively, but digital seems to be treated as as afterthought in the text and ignored in the photos. A revised edition addressing these shortfalls would earn a full 5 star review."
1,Can I rate it less than 1 star?,"I am not a horror genre fan, but picked up the book when it looked like a good old-fashioned cheesy ""mummy"" story. I admit it, give me a story about a mummy or Egypt, and I'll often read it even if only for the chuckle value. This book was so disappointing, that I did not even finish it. The multiple plot lines vary from ""fairly interesting"" to unsettlingly sadistic and I found no reason to follow the stories through, even just to see if ""it all comes together in the end""."
1,Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover,"Looking at the cover the book appears to be a mummy thriller. I expected the creepy tomb feel with a good story. What I got was trashy sex that didn't seem to fit into the story at all. As a matter of fact, most of the characters didn't tie in together at all. It is too bad because Laymon had a good story base with the mummy if he would have just kept to it and left the other story plots out of the book. The result was a very bad book and I felt cheated."
4,Richard Laymon is _always_ good.,"The storyline with the cages is even better than the main plot focusing on the mummy.I highly recommend Laymon's other books, particularly his novels ISLAND and MIDNIGHT'S LAIR."
4,Yum!,"the book is thick with recipes and tips, not a lot of 'quick easy' stuff unfortunately- but definitly full of memorable delicious old style Italian kitchen cooking..... tried 4 dishes so far and have entered food comas on them all. My grandmother would always tell me to find a couple dishes to try and make until I mastered them, then move onto new ones. I can only hope to do that with half of this book. happy cooking!"
4,Easy to follow,"The recipes in this book and Lydia's others are very straight forward. I have made a few from this book and always had very good results. Everything is well written, and easy to understand. I look forward to getting her other books. You will be able to serve superb meals."
4,Better food than Most Italian Restaurants,"This is a great basic cookbook. I have about 15 Italian cookbooks and when I am going to make a dish, I look at two or three recipes and take what I like from each. Inevitably, Lidia's cookbook usually provides the best insight to the dish. There are ingrediants I can usually find at the Italian grocery store.I could hardly put this book down. [...]It is an invaluable addition to my cookbook collection. You HAVE to HAVE this book!"
2,Not worth the money,The recipes are bland and troublesome. The basics are terrible. The chicken stock was absolutely boring. I threw the book away when I realized the ragu and meat sauce recipes had no garlic or spices or any kind except bay leaves. I had high hopes and now wish I had saved the cost of the book and bought a decent meal instead.
4,"Great Lidia, but not perfect","Four and a half, really. Every recipe in this book is working for me so far...until I got to Biscotti. While other biscotti recipes call for 1-3 cups of flour, Lidia's calls for 6, but she's the expert, so I used 6 in my first try knowing it was way too much, and knowing I should have checked baking911 for a second opinion. So I blame myself for a first-ever total baking failure. At least they are usually edible; aside from the predictable outcome of too much flour, the final product tasted like hardened library paste. But that's a minor (if expensive) flaw in an otherwise near-perfect cookbook. Lidia's style is warm and generous, and her main dish recipes are bullet-proof, almost as good as her restaurant dishes. The extra drizzles of olive oil are a matter of personal preference, but I still love her more'n my luggage. Brava, Lidia!"
3,Good Italian Cookbook,"There are several recipes that I have cooked out of this cookbook, and while they are all good, I tend to like to see a picture of what I am cooking. Other than that, the recipes were easy to follow and the ingredients werent too out of the ordinary."
3,"Lots of good recipes, but unfortunately no pictures.","I know it may sound childish, but I really wish this book has color photos of some of the dishes. I've been a fan of Lidia's PBS TV show and there are plenty of good recipes and info in the cookbook, but part of making a cookbook interesting is to show how beautiful recipes can be. Because of that i'm only giving it 3 stars. Hopefully her new cookbook will include more color."
5,Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen,"I am an avid fan of Lidia M. Bastianich's PBS TV cooking show. Lidia's book has much more than the standard, simple pasta and spaghetti dishes. She is truly a cooking artist and this book reflects her love of all types of cooking, especially Italian. If I had only one Italian cookbook, it would be this one!"
2,Not for me,Im really surprised. this book for me was a bit of a mess. everything that happened was drawn out with so much thinking from the lead character. was also totally unrealistic. just didnt do it for me at all and i was really disappointed.
4,Obsession,The book was very intriguing and kept the reader in suspense quite often - although parts were quite graphic and may not appeal to everyone.
1,Really Worth Minus Stars,"Unless you are a gay man who likes to be titillated by soft-core porn, don't bother. Glenn Roven, are you kidding, well-written? Stick to piano playing."
2,"Terrible History, Decent planning help","Please please please don't belive hardly ANYTHING this author tells you about the ""ancient history of celtic handfasting"". All of this God/Goddess duality is GREAT for Wiccans, but please please don't believe that that is how the ""ancient Celts"" actually practiced and worshiped. We have hardly ANY evidence for the prehistoric Celts, and what we have is skewed, slanted, and possibly even misinterpreted (archaeological evidence is VERY difficult to interpret). The author does a decent job of giving you things to think about for planning your wedding (such as date, place, altar objects, etc) but I wouldn't say that she does a super job of anything, really."
5,"Rugged, useful tool","Because of it's ideal size, I'm able to always keep my truckman demolition axe handy - I keep one in my car and another in my truck. Optimum size for ease of storage & highly portable. Yet it's a really serious tool on which I can easily use both hands to get more power in my swing. Very well balanced for such a formidable tool.The pointed ends are especially useful in tearing out light aluminum & exterior steel siding and panels such as you'll find on mobile homes, RVs, automobiles, trucks, buildings & houses. It's a sure bet in helping me easily remove drywall. I always carry one with me in both vehicles so I can easily break out of my vehicle if necessary or into another damaged vehicle to try to help someone in need."
1,Unhappy camper,"The item that was shipped was a completely different item. Different color, different internal holding material, and no hook on the to attach to something. While the item I was sent is still an SD holder, it's 100% not what I ordered. :("
2,Not received what is in the picture,"I received a black case, which is nice in the outside, but I'm not really convinced about the hard foam it has in the inside. I had bought these cases before and the inner material that holds the cards is solid and perfect because it holds them tight yet it's easy to take them out. This new foam doesn't seem as good. And they didn't send what they announce in the picture."
3,It's a memory card case,"I must say, I expected the interior to not be hard rubber and instead be a softer material. The coloring is okay in my opinion, a bit darker than the picture the seller provides. Overall, it seems to be of good quality. My only fear is that the clasp to hold it shut might snap as it is only plastic. Yet, your memory cards will be well protected. It holds 4 memory cards and is about 1/2 inch thick; I do not find this to be a problem. I give it 3/5 stars solely because the clasp and hinges are quite breakable."
3,"Only holds 4 cards, not eight like the picture",I bought this item thinking it was like the one in the photo: a large case that holds 8 cards with a smaller one that holds four. Well you actually just get the smaller one. Guess I should have read the fine print. The case is sturdy but I really wanted the 8 space case.
3,Picture is misleading,"The picture is a little misleading, from the picture I thought there was space for 6 cards!"
3,Card case,"Looks like a tough unit that will defineately protect your cards. If there is a weak part it would have to be the hinge, but that remains to be seen."
3,No like the picture.,"Buy this product, thinking of 6SD , like the pic. but I receive only for 4.Otherwise good Qty."
1,Deceptive Photo,"Based on the photo, I expected to receive two pieces, an 8-card case and a 4-card case. It is only an 4-card case. The description did not make it clear that it was two separate items in the photo. If it had been the 8-card case I would have been satisfied (not happy, but satisfied) because that is what I wanted. I had to buy another product to actually get what I wanted. It would have cost me nearly as much to return it as a buying the new one so I just kept it. The description and photos need to be more accurate. I will say the that the 4-card case seems to be good quality for what it is."
5,only 4 slots,I don't have to scramble around to look for my memory sticks and it's easily accessible. Very nice to have around.
5,Velbon DMSP-SD4 Plastic Case for Digital Memory,"For anyone carrying a number of SD cards around, this case is a MUST HAVE. The sturdy and user-friendly design is perfect for both music and photo enthusiasts, with the attached ""clip-on strap"" supporting connection to other carrying cases."
1,Digital memory case,"I purchased this item last Christmas and LOVED it, came exactly as the picture shows in the ad. However, I purchased one this Christmas for my mother and it looks NOTHING like the picture. There is NO key ring with it (the main reason I liked this one so much). The rest of it is pretty much the same, but there is NO key ring with the item I ordered!"
4,It's a very inexpensive way to keep your cards in one place.,"I purchased this after first purchasing the Pelican 0910-010-110 Secure Digital Memory Card Case. That case was overkill for my daily needs.The Hakuba is very light weight, and won't pull your pockets down while you're walking around. It is much bulkier than I'd expected however."
5,"So cute, so handy",I ordered this memory card case on a whim and love it! It's sturdy plastic and can clip onto the inside of your camera bag/backpack/purse/whatever for safe keeping. I like having all my memory cards in one place rather than them floating around in the flimsy packaging they came in. Recommend!
4,"Good Case--""Living Hinge"" is a Drawback","Good case, but the ""living hinge"" and latch means that it's going to ""die."" Rather than having a proper hinge and a latch with through-pins, the plastic will eventually fail, allowing the case to come open."
5,OOPS-,"This thing is great. Love that it can take a hard blow..like my horse stepping on it and not breaking...I swear it could withstand that kind of impact. Love the rubberized interior , pliable but firm. One little problem I didn't realize when I ordered...only fits one size SD card...and mine were all too small. Size wasn't specified in advertisement...wish it would have been.If your cards fit, this is a great case."
2,Item is not as ordered.,"Item is not as shown as when i purchased it. Different color and inside material and construction is different. This is my second purchase, first was OK."
4,Hakuba DMSP-SD4 Mediacase,"It's very durable and well made to fit exactly 4 SD cards, but the only thing about this product is that it did not come with the metal chain. I am disappointed. I think it is misleading to advertised it as having it, but the delivered product did not have it."
5,Hate the Color!,"Great little hard case. Holds two SD cards on each side, and it hangs by it's tether from the netting in the top of my Canon ""Rebel"" bag on the inside perfectly. Each time you open the bag it is pulled up from the pocket where it hangs and presented for quick access. I store the cards with label up to indicate they are empty and ready to be used. Cards with pictures on them are placed back in the case face down to indicate they have pictures that need to be downloaded. The SD cards are definitely protected and the case is most likely water-proof. No doubt it is water resistant."
1,Misleading information,I bought this item for my Honda Pilot 2003 and have not been able to use it at all. It is not compatible. This company did not answer to my inquiries. They should not advertised this as for all models 2003 and up because is not true.
3,Portion Control,"This scale is okay but I found a digital, more precise scale I like much better. The bowl with this scale is very handy and it was a good value for the less expensive price. Just nothing to rave about."
3,"informative, but too much shows oriented","I didn't not like this book, it was pretty interesting and well written. BUT when I read a dog-book the first things I want to read are about the character, habits and special pecularities about the animal. I'm going to buy a bloodhound pretty soon and I'm not interested at all on dog-shows and stuff like that. To me it looked more for bloodhounds effective breeders than for first owners. Informative, but not really well balanced."
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed with this movie. It says it comes with English subtitles, but it does not. So, be careful."
2,Project not tight in the middle,"Bought the 24"" frame, the ratchet design is a great idea and it would great, but the ""S"" dowel doesn't hold the fabric in the middle. I can scroll up and down easily, but the fabric is too loose in the middle of the project and after working on it for a couple of hours it becomes so loose that you need to take it apart and set it up again-which is not an easily task since the fabric slips out of the S rods. This might work better for smaller projects, but is a waste of money for large projects. They need to do a ""snap in place"" rod with the ratchet design, that would work much better.Eve in NJ"
5,A must to own,"Deflecta-Shield 9900 Hitch Hand Truck Bed ExtenderThis is a great product. I have a GMC short bed crew cab and had trouble hauling things with any length. Since I purchased the Deflecta-Shield Bed Extender, I have been hauling long ladders, lumber and pipe with ease. I can trust it will carry the load because of its heavy construction. Unlike other brands of bed extenders, it actually extends well beyond the tailgate to give support for those long loads. Even though it may cost more than some other brands, it is well worth the difference."
2,Doesn't work with my 2002 GM Pick Up,Clever product. One significant design flaw though. I cannot raise it high enough to reach the level of my truck bed. I have a 2002 GMC 2500HD with the factory hitch receiver and the GM bedliner. The hitch hand is several inches short at its highest setting. I called Steelhorse technical support and the guy was disinterested in helping me find a solution or taking note of the problem.
4,Worth Reading,"This is a well written, well researched book that gives a solid introduction to Hildegard of Bingen. The author presents Hildegard's life in chronological order. She points out where sources conflict and presents various viewpoints on controversial topics without coming across as biased or judgmental. The text reads well and quickly. At times the author's sense of humor comes through and adds some welcome levity. The book could be more in depth, and there is some fluff that could have been cut out. All in all this is a book well worth reading."
5,Fascinating and indepth,"Although its more than 500 pages may seem a bit overwhelming, the content is fascinating. Garber has explored the world of bisexuality from every angle and back to antiquity until today. Reading it will make you question your own feelings about the meaning of ""sexuality."" All done authoritatively without being scholarly, although it is not light reading."
2,Pardon me?,"I thought this was an enjoyable book for the most part, but I am bewildered by the blurb on the back comparing the author's scholarly contribution to the work of Copernicus. Wouldn't that suggest that she would at least have an original and clear thesis in there? Instead, we get a mish-mash of gossip, innuendo, and lame puns for over 500 pages. The closest I came to finding a thesis was the idea that bisexuality is extremely common yet has been denied for centuries... which wasn't even original when Freud said it. The book reads like the sort of thing Entertainment Weekly would have published; the thinking is fuzzy and superficial, and the writing is glib and confused. Entertaining for what it is, but, as scholarship, it shows mostly how far the Ivy Leagues have fallen."
2,Less substance then portrayed,"I bought this book in hopes of understanding my own bisexuality better. I was greatly disappointed. The author spends most of the writing on the lives of famous/infamous bi's. The real lives of everyday bi-sexual indivuals and their rejection by straights,gays and lesbians is glossed over for the most part.As a textbook for a under graduate or post graduate course on geder studies it has a place,I will agree. But that is it's only worthwhile place."
5,What an exceptional truthful book!,"Every young black man should read Roland's book. He has quite an insight and speaks of the reality of events of the past and present. The kind of wisdom that Roland has only comes from God.Thanks Roland for sharing and revealing the truth of this present era.Honest, enlightening and informative book!"
1,Oh brother here we go again,"On June 18, Martin posted an editorial in [...], ""Enough with Baseball and Steroids"", where he whines about the treatment of Sammy Sosa who now faces perjury charges for lying to Congress about his steroid use. Martin argues to just(for whatever reason) close the book, and let bygones be bygones. His arguments are ""I'm tired of rehashing the old drama"", "" and ""I'm sick of it"".So I guess the same could be said for his dredging up of decades and centuries old ugly moments in history as this angry man presents America as an oppressive intolerant society. I think we are all getting tired of racial diatribes. None of us alive today are responsible for what some people did back in history. To put in the author's words, ""So, can we just move the hell on?"
3,"Starts slow, but picks up quickly","The first part of this film, which depicts the materialistic life of the Sextons, I found a bit slow, but I realize it was necessary to set the stage for the much much funnier part of the film, when Tim and Kirstie's characters hide out amongst the Amish. These roles were perfect for both Allen and Alley. Tim Allen is an underutilized talent - now that ""Home Improvement"" is done, I hope that he will do more films. Kirstie Alley is always terrific. A good little family movie."
4,Fun comedy for the family,"This was a cute little comedy. Kirstie and Tim make a great romantic comedy team. This would make a great addition to your DVD collection. The storyline is pretty basic, rich couple has accountant that takes their monies for personal gain, disappears and leaves them in financial lurch, they hide from authorities in Amish country until their lawyer can track down accountant to set things straight, in the meantime, they work on repairing their marriage, fall in love all over again, and learn to appreciate the simpler things in life."
3,Two Different Movies,"For me this was two movies --- the first all tinsel and the second was much improved, a delightful spin of the fast lane turned Amish.The bits about Jacob and Emma finding themselves and their marriage again was charming and entertaining.Thus, 1 star for first half, 4 for second, three overall."
5,Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley shine ...,"Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley shine in this humorous ""money doesn't buy happiness"" flick. A wealthy couple with marital problems and a no good lawyer/financial advisor thrown into an Amish community create some memorial moments...can't help using the phrase ""children of the corn"" from the movie!"
3,It grows on you,"Initially, I thought the movie was good, but not spectacular. The more I see it, the more I realize how true most of its sentiments are. It shows us what is really important in life, and it is not the new Jaguar in the driveway. I like the ""outtakes"" and ""deletions"" during the credits, as well as the follow-up with them at the same pond that started their time in ""hiding."" My wife and I and our 5-year-old son now love this movie."
5,Great movie!,"I think this is a very hilarious movie. Tim Allen & Kirstie Alley are perfect as the couple running away from the IRS and the movie trails the path the couple decides to take when they reside in a very traditional Amish community. They inject some life into the community; Tim helps to plow the fields with ""Big-John"" and Kirstie adds colour into their grey traditional clothes. It is a very humourous movie and it is touching when the couple stand together side by side when the Judge decides to pass a sentence and we know that they have truly reconciled their differences and are a couple again, no longer on the brink of divorce. Everyone should really watch this movie with their families. It is a very enjoyable movie!"
4,Light Fun,"a very entertaining yet thought provoking movie. slow at times, but carried by the interaction of Kirstie Alley and Tim Allen. A few laugh out loud moments. Worth checking out"
4,Entertaining,"Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley do a pretty good job in this film about a wealthy but feuding couple who have to go into hiding after being set up and robbed by their accountant. Though the story is predictable (very much so) at times, Allen and Alley do a decent job in their roles, so this is a film worth watching once, in my opinion."
5,Great and Funny movie,"We love this movie, had it on VHS so we replaced it with DVD. Will watch several times for great laughs!"
4,A good family film - with only a few bowling words...,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The language is just spicey enough to garner a PG-13 rating (sadly, so).However, it is a cute and timeless story about re-evaluating what it is we're doing with our lives and our time and our money.It is a wee bit predictable, but it is also a good message that society needs to hear again and again. And the ending was very sweet.I watched it with my 13 year old daughter and the offensive scenes (squeaking beds and such) were vague enough to make it safe for most kids, in my maternal opinion."
2,okay,the movie was okay. the performance was not that great. i would not watch it again.the humor was terrible. this is a ladies movie not for guys.
2,could have been a lot better,"I wonder why this movie is so well-known. It has some serious dismerits:1. It's tough to swallow. The plot could have been much better without sacrificing much of the comedy.2. Er, what comedy? The movie takes itself so seriously on so many occasions that you wonder if we're really here to laugh.3. The ""peek at Amish society"" was much better done inWitness (Special Collector's Edition)(Widescreen); this one has many major inaccuracies.4. The hatred between the husband and wife was so convincing, that their later rapprochement isn't.5. No subtitles or extras!"
3,Could have been better,"I thoroughly enjoyed the plot; however, it sometimes got to be too repetitive and the numerous typos and grammatical errors really irritated me."
3,WHISPERS,i OVE READING ANY BOOKS BY LISA JACKSON. SHE KEEPS U ON THE EDGE OF UR SEAT AND U CAN REALLY GET INTO THE CHARACTERS THAT SHES CREATED FOR EACH OF HER BOOKS.
3,whispers,Was quite an average book but it was easy to read. It was pretty predictablehow it would end. The author is usually better.
3,Peopled by Adolescents,"The good news is that the plot is fun and I want to get back to the next chapter to find out what happened to the two dead guys. The bad news is that the characters seem to lack depth, nuance, and maturity. It seems like all the characters, young or old, are adolescents regularly acting out their ample collections of hurts and anger. There seem no mature parents or wise figures in this book. While Claire and Kane are sympathetic, other characters seem to be stock self-destroyers. Finally, the sexual scenes seem interchangeable as if there is only one way to have sexual relations."
3,Average read,"This book was a decent read for its genre; decent characterization, plenty of sex, and a better than average story. It would make for a good beach read. One thing I have to remember with romantic suspense is that there is usually minimal romance and this book is no exception. Basically you aren't wasting your time by reading this book, but you won't be missing anything if you don't.My one big annoyance with this book is the setting. The author claims to be a Northwest native, yet she is completely off on her depictions of the Oregon coast. The atmosphere and the weather she describes in her book sound much more like a beach on the East coast and nothing like the actual Oregon coast. This isn't that big of a deal for this type of book, especially for readers who have never been to the Oregon coast and won't know the difference. However, it was pretty annoying to me as a resident of the Northwest that she would get it so wrong."
4,intriguing...,"This book was pretty involved and very intriguing. Each of the sister's lives, not to mention all the other characters, really kept me in suspense. The fued between the Taggerts and the Hollands was interesting. The only reason I can't rate this book higher is because the sex gets to be too much. Everyone is constantly having sex and the graphic nature of it gets to be tedious and boring. Each encounter is the same and I found myself skimming the sex parts to get to the meat of the story. I mean, who cares? I enjoy a good mystery and this story has murder, suspense, romance, the works, but the sex is way overdone. This is the second Lisa Jackson book I have read and it seems as though she tries too hard to throw that in when in reality it is not necessary for a good story. Leaving a little to the imagination is a good thing sometimes."
4,Okay book,"This was a pretty good book but I can't stand finding grammatical erros and repitition. It was pretty engrossing at the beginning and then I found myself just trying to get to the end to find out who had killed Jack, Harley and Hunter. Weston was a true sleazeball and I had difficulty believing that any of the Holland girls fell into his grips at times. I haven't decided if this book was good enough to move on to more Lisa Jackson books. May give something else a try."
3,Good story,"I like the fact that the story starts in the present time, reverts back sixteen years earlier to get the background, and then returns to the present time to wrap things up. This held my interest until the very last page. This is the second book I've read by Lisa Jackson and I plan on reading more."
5,Whispers,"Book arrived quickly, a real steal for the money! Great reading! I love Lisa Jackson books! Thumbs up!"
3,useful but Eyewitness guides are better,"This is a good book but if you want to get a feel for a place before visiting, photographs are essential. The Dorling Kindersley Eyewitness Guide to Japan has photos; this one doesn't. So the Eyewitness guide ended up being the one that we carried about with us."

3,Not The Best Source To Learn From.,"Initially when I first bought this book, I worked my way through it for a while and then put it on hiatus. Later after quite some time had passed, I finally worked my way through the rest of it. I've been learning German for almost three years now, but I can't really recommend this book. My belief is that if you are a beginner, you need to buy a CD or cassette pack. You need to hear native speakers reciting the language and not just read and pronounce it from a book. I found this book to be okay, but it just wasn't that interesting. I never refer back it. Two sources I've learned a lot from are Basic German from Berlitz and Just Listen and Learn German."
2,"Good concept, poorly executed...","While I have been drawn to the ""...for Dummies"" and the ""Idiot's..."" series for their combination of simplicity and humor, I found this book to be lacking when I read it after choosing it as a ""first read"" in preparation for self-study of German. It is quickly boring and nonengaging, throwing multiple poorly chosen tables in with a few fill-in-the blank exercises. I struggled to finish the book, turning to Berlitz's ""Essential German"" and ""German in 10 minutes a day"" instead, although my prime teacher has been the (highly recommended) Pimsleur series of tapes. I agree with most of the (negative) critiques below, and recommend a beginner to pass on this book, lest he/she give up on the language. Achtung, baby!"
2,Save your money and take a class.,"Don't wate your money on this book. It's hard to understand, and leaves a lot unclear. If you really want to learn German, get yourself an English-German dictionary and take a class at your local community college."
2,This book isn't very helpful.,I found this book to be very much unhelpful to a person w/o some previous German experience.
2,Questionable product,"Just received this BoxWave USB Lightning cable. As others have mentioned the Lightning plug is slightly larger than the Apple OEM and requires some effort to insert into the Iphone 5. I am hesitant to use it until I hear more reports, particularly regarding any damage to the iPhone as a result of forcing a plug into the slot. It says GUARANTEED to charge and sync, but no guarantee as to any damage it might do to the iPhone."
2,Seems cheap but its working,I was concerned with how difficult it was to get the plug to go completely in. Too snug of a fit. Feels cheap in your hand.
1,Did not work on iPhone 5.,"Ordered this with much anticipation, as I was looking for a second cable for my new iPhone 5. Waited beyond shipping date to receive the product, it did not work on iPhone 5. Does not charge or sync. Returning as defective."
1,Doesn't work - does not charge iPhone 5,"The cord looks good, seems of decent quality, but mine was a complete dud. It doesn't charge off my computer USB port or in connection with a wall adapter."
5,Works well and longer cord,"Nice alternate to the OEM cord by apple. Added bonus, the cord is longer than apples too. Highly recommend for a cheaper price."
1,Not good,The charger fell apart within two weeks of having the product. The silver part that plugs into the USB came out of the black part. Not a happy camper.
2,"It works, but.....","I've had this about a month and a half. The wires near the 8 pin plug are starting to show. This shouldn't be happening. I'm not impressed, nor am I thrilled with the 30 day return window - should be able to have a bit more than 30 days to see if...oh, I don't know....the wires start poking out of one end!"
3,Not a perfect fit,"Once I finally got these delivered, I almost wish they hadn't arrived. The cord that goes into the phone is a bit loose, so I have to move it around until it makes connection to start charging. Then I have to leave it sitting still or it slips & stops charging - just touching it can cause it to slip. That makes it hard if wanting to use while charging. I guess for the cheaper price, I can deal with it & use my original iPhone cord when I don't want to leave it lying still."
2,Still Not Perfect...,"I don't write many reviews on Amazon, but felt compelled to write this one. Seems you always take a chance buying a knock-off product and this is no exception. While the cable seems well made, it's the lightning connector that's the issue. Unlike the OEM cable, which you can insert fully and get the phone (I'm charging an iPhone5) to charge, with this cable when you insert it fully, it doesn't charge the phone. I needed to use my thumb and forefinger to pull out the cable ever so slightly to get the phone to recognize it and begin charging. I purchased 2 of these cables and both needed the same technique. While it does work, to me, it's not a perfect clone of the OEM cable."
