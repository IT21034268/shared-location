1,"Arrrrgggghhhhhhhhhh, this spacebar!","How is this spacebar possible? This keyboard is hardly usable. Don't buy this unless you're looking for strength training for your thumbs. I'm sorry, what? I couldn't hear you over this noisy spacebar. I would write more, but my thumbs need a break."
2,cut corner on wrist rest - a serious problem if you have big hands,"It was almost a better keyboard than all the rest, BUT- It is less bent than the earlier natural keyboards -- - unless you are tiny, your wrists won't be straight- the home-end-pgup-pgdn key group are changed again -- - back to 2 rows of 3 keys- - - if you just relearned the 3 rows of 2 keys layout, this is really bad- the left corner of the wrist rest is cut way too close -- - if you have big hands the edge digs into your hand - miserable!- the rows of keys are FLAT -- - you must prop your wrists up high- - - - so you don't hit the key below the one you want- - - - BUT adding a wrist rest hides the LED's for caplock, etc- - - - - and blocks the back & forward buttons- the cord exits right on the edge- - don't let it land on edge - the cord will be severely bent- - - I lost a Natural MM KB with a cord like this- - - - (Natural Pro recessed the cord exit, no risk of bent cord)"
1,Space bar does not work during normal typing,The Keyboard design is fantastic! Nevertheless I would highly recommend that you AVOID this model. During normal typing 1 out of every 20 times you hit the space bar it will work. Your sentences become one big long stream of letters and you have to unnaturally SLAM the space bar to make it work. Not a good keyboard for anyone that does typing faster than 5 - 8 WPM
3,"Good keyboard, poor Mac drivers","This keyboard is compatible with Mac OS X, but the drivers are poorly written, and it is difficult to customise the buttons on the keyboard (the drivers will not even allow you to customise some buttons at all). Moreover, the ""zoom"" feature only works marginally. Also, it lacks any USB ports, which usually come standard on keyboards for the Mac (to plug mice into, for example). Besides these problems, it is a very comfortable keyboard, typing on it is actually an enjoyable experience. So in conclusion, the actual typing part of the keyboard is very good, but all of the periphery things it has are problematic."
2,Great until it stops working,"This keyboard was terrific for me until the E and L keys stopped working 55 days after I purchased it. Unfortunately, Microsoft's warranty on this keyboard only lasts for 45 days. So now I'm stuck with a large, useless keyboard. I would recommend buying an ergonomic keyboard with a stronger return/refund/exchange warranty.UPDATE 3/18/2008Surprisingly, Microsoft sent me a replacement for the aforementioned keyboard. It worked like a charm until this morning, when the exact same thing happened again. Random characters and other random things started happening on my Mac until I unplugged the keyboard. Hopefully Microsoft will be kind enough to replace their replacement. Whether they do or don't replace this one, I cannot recommend this item at all. Beware that if you purchase it, it might stop working suddenly."
5,Very nice Keyboard - absolutely recommended,Bought this one from Amazon for my wife after trying at Staples several others too. She is absolutely happy now and her wrists feel better too. She likes most of the additional key functions very much.
1,Natural: sure; ergonomic: not so much -- too hard to type!,"This keyboard has nice large keys and an agreeable shape but the keyboard action is way too heavy and it takes up so much space that you have to move your mouse way off to the side. I've switched over to an old, flat logitech keyboard that agrees with my forearms/wrists much better. If you're looking for an ergonomic keyboard, I'd keep on looking.Also, the software for mac is stuck in the dark ages. Can't ding it too much for that, but it's hilarious to see it mention ""sherlock"", which hasn't been around for the past decade."
3,Died after 6 months,For the 6 months it worked like a charm then after that 1/2 the keyboard buttons went dead sigh must be my bad ;(
5,Natural Keyboard,I had a simular keyboard but when I upgraded to Windows 7 that old keyboard did not work and there were no update drivers available. I searched the internet and this is the one that came close to my old one that I loved.No problem with this keyboard and I love it. I never get tired no matter how much typing I do.
2,"Good design, Shoddy construction","I enjoy the ergonomics of the key board, but one feature that I also love is the quite touch keys. Well they all are quite except the SPACE BAR, the most used key of all! It's some how seperated from the rubber spring pad under it, so every time I press it, it makes a loud clicking noise. Well the space bar spans both left and right hand sides and, in my case, only the right side of the space bar clicks, so I've slowly been learning to use the space bar with my left thumb. This may not work because I've spent so long using my right thumb. The fact of the matter is, I shouldn't have to make these exceptions. Don't be gutless like me and make sure you return your keyboard if any of hte keys make clicking noises."
3,Looked to be better than I found it to be,"The keyboard has lots of functions, mostly via dual-function keys which have both functions written on them. The problem for me was that the entire keyboard is black (who ever thought that a dark black keyboard was what the world was waiting for?), but the lettering on the keys is in a light gray - not white. I had to place a lamp alongside the keyboard in order to be able to read the dual-functions written on the keys. My old ergonomic keyboard, also a Microsoft, is white with black lettering, which is easier to read by magnitudes. I returned this black keyboard only because I had difficulty reading it. Part of the problem may be that I'm 75. But, in my defense, I've been working in the data communication and computer field since 1962, and this is one of the least legible keyboards I've seen."
1,remapped keys,Alt-f4 doesn't work because Microsoft remapped the keys on this keyboard so the keyboard's shortcuts don't work the same way as the Windows operating system.
4,"""Sticky"" keys but works well with a Mac","I think the keys are louder and ""stickier"" than I'd like them to be. Other than that, the multimedia keys work well with my Mac (Leopard) and I like the integrated wrist pad. Because I replaced the standard Mac keyboard with this one, I had to buy a USB hub to get back the USB ports I lost."
2,"""N"" doesn't register !!","I agree Microsoft has to work on quality control, here's a paragraph with the word ""none"" typed with this keyboard to show how often it didn't register ""n"":none none none none none none none none one none none none one none none none none oe none none none oe none none none none noe none none noneIt reduced my word accuracy by 17% by eating ""n"" in 5 of my 30 sample words !A pity, there are so many lemons in this line, since it is an otherwise a good product !"
2,6 is mis-positioned and key letters are worn already,"I'm a touch typist, and was taught that the left index finger types the numbers four and five, and the right index finger types the numbers six and seven. Guess what? The number six is split off from the right side of the keyboard so you must type it with the left hand. After typing the same way for thirty seven years, I cannot adjust. Plus this then requires you use the left index finger for three different numbers. Is this supposed to be an ergonomic style? In addition, I've used the keyboard for about two mos. (with 10 days of vacation in the midst) and already four of the keys have the printing nearly worn off. Not a good quality! Too bad, because the shape is comfortable."
4,Purchasing Agent,"Very nice keyboard. Very comfortable, not as loud as others have said. Keeps the tennis elbow and carpel tunnel from hurting. The keys are not a light touch, which would have made it even more comfortable. I would recommend it. The padded wrist rest is also a nice addition."
2,Tough Keys!,"The keyboard was easy to install, but once installed you notice a huge transition from traditional keyboards! Some of the keys have a little too much spring in the keys...meaning that they keys can be difficult to push down. The spacebar is not easy to push down w/ your thumbs. It makes typing cumbersome at times. Not sure if it is really helping me too much. I'd stick with a traditional keyboard that is a lot easier to push down on the buttons."
3,Not what i thought it would be,"The space bar could have been better, but i am getting used to it. The backspace is hard to reach, if you have small hands this is a no go. If you are hoping to be able to type faster, good luck, this is not your keyboard. I thought the zoom was a trackball, it is not, my mistake. If it WAS a trackball I would have been sooo happy. If they split the space bar, add a trackball and bring the backspace closer.. It could be perfect!"
1,"Great keyboard, lame space bar","This is my first ergonomic keyboard, and although it feels kinda strange, I know it will worth in the long run, but the space key is the worst I've ever seen. Besides being huge, its hard and it stucks when you hit on the sides."
1,Horrible spacebar,"I can't imagine why an ergonomic product, designed to ease physical effort/strain would require greater effort/strain in the most frequently pressed key, the space bar. I won't regurgitate the design flaw, since others on this board have mentioned (which I regret having accessed only after receiving the keyboard), but I have put it back into the box to return. I usually try to avoid the hassle of returning things, but this keyboard is just too seriously flawed to overlook. Kudos to those of you who aren't bothered by it."
1,SPACE BAR DOES NOT WORK!,"DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER IF YOU HAVE A LIGHT TOUCH AND/OR SMALLER HANDS.THEY BLEW THE DESIGN WHEN IT CAME TO THE SPACE BAR!If you hit the edge or near the side of the space bar it will not spread the force of your touch-it simply does nothing.I've tried other keyboards, demo keyboards at BestBuy and Frys, same thing.After 4 days of my thumb going numb I'm returning this keyboard and will revert back to my orignial keyboard."
2,Cumbersome.......,"Helps w/the CT thing, but slows my keying speed down as I have short fingers & never did keep fingers in place. Glad I decided on the wired instead of the wireless dollar wise as I suspect that would be the same & returning items is a pain."
1,Keyboard,It is a very nice keyboard but some of the keys dont work right. The company was great as far as giving me another one but this one has problems too. I don't want to be a bother so I haven't said anything about the replacement being messed up too.
3,Easy to Use,"I find this product easy to type on, and it's good and solid and doesn't slip and slide around my desk as I type. Only one key didn't work, but it was a relatively minor key so I can live without it. The space bar is easy to depress but I found it a bit loud. Definitely helps angle my hands and arms so I don't hunch my shoulders too."
2,Space Bar Issue,I was thinking I just picked a keyboard that happen to have a problem with the space bar...which sometimes happens with mass produced items. Every once in a while a unit ships that has a flaw. But after coming to look at the price - to compare amazon with the price I paid - I looked at the review and someone wrote yesterday that they have the exact same problem.So I think I'll return this one to the store and buy the other one I was looking at - the same one I use at work. I just type too much and too fast to deal with this space bar and I don't think it's going to improve.
2,"Good design, BAD Quality","I bought this keyboard thinking I had found my holy grail, only to be surprised 3 months later (that's right, 3 MONTHS) when it completely stopped working. Took it apart, and realized there's nothing to fix - it's all a giant maze of electrical conduits.While the keyboard was super quiet, ergonomic and convenient, after only 2 1/2 weeks, the spacebar started sticking when pressed. I did not heed the negative reviews about it's quality, thinking they were exaggerating, and I paid for that lesson learned.It was good while it lasted. All in all, a horrible waste of money. I have now switched and fallen in love with the Logitech Wave Keyboard (which I've had 2 of for almost 3 years now! They look and feel like new)."
1,Don't Buy It...,"My boss and I both purchased this keyboard about 5 months ago and I am already on here shopping for a new keyboard...I loved the design of this keyboard and have enjoyed using it, but some of the keys have quit working for no apparent reason...We popped the keys off to see if something had fallen under the key and to see if something had been spilt on it, but nothing was apparent...My boss has also had problems with hers...After about 3 months of use the lettering on the keys started wearing off...To sum up, the design of the keyboard is awesome, but the quality of this product is pathetic..."
2,Pretty good except for the F-Lock,"The drawback is the F-Lock key especially when you need to reboot the computer and go into Safe Mode. Because the F-Lock does not automatically come on, you have to try to press it and get it to stay while you press F8 to go into Safe Mode."
2,good but not great,"I've used this keyboard for about a month and a half. The construction seems solid and it all seems well thought out. My biggest issue with the keyboard is that the spacing of the keys is too far apart. Hitting CTRL C is a strain on the left hand. My hands are average to large so I think this keyboard would be very difficult for a user with small hands. Also, the space key is extremely loud; can't think of any reason it should be so loud. I disliked it enough that I bought a new keyboard and sold this one."
1,Doesnt work...,"I know i probably got a bum unit, but mine stopped working soon after i got it. Worst part is, its borderline impossible to get a hold of microsoft for a replacement. So i ended up witha 35 dollar hunk of plastic."
1,Spacebar H E (double hockey sticks),"This keyboard is enormous, but there is only one giant, loud, sticky spacebar. The spacebar is so bad, the product is completely unusable for me. My speed/error rate is horrendous on this keyboard because I can't get the spacebar to properly work and when it does it's so loud.If you search online for this product and spacebar, you'll see dozens of sites all with tips to fix the problem. I tried them all and finally gave up and put this keyboard in the trash and will have to find something else. It was the most frustrating 2 weeks of my life while I tried to re-teach my self to hit the space bar with two thumbs since sometimes that worked.No longer will I fight this waste of money keyboard."
5,Ergonomic keyboard,"This is by far the best ergonomic keyboard I have ever used. What I love the most about it is that all you have to move are your fingers. You don't have to lift your hands at all. I was a medical transcriptionist and wish I had this keyboard to work with. I certainly would have made more money. If your job requires you to use a keyboard all day, this is the one. I was beginning to get carpal tunnel when someone said I needed to change to an ergonomic keyboard and that's what I did. It took a week or so to get used to it but once I got used to it and used it all the time my carpal tunnel went away and hasn't come back. I can't use a regular keyboard anymore though. When you use a regular keyboard it really reveals how ergonomic works and you realize the advantages. It's amazing. I have no complaints about the sound of keys clicking or the keyboard making too much sound. I love this keyboard and will put up with any sound it makes. Also, this is pure quality."
1,Only lasted 4 months,This keyboard only lasted 4 months and then random keys stopped working.I like the keyboard but can't recommend it.
3,space bar is too hard to press,I have only had the keyboard for a couple of days but the space bar is much to hard to press and I keep missing spaces. I don't know if I will keep it. Otherwise I would. I like the zoom feature and the calculator. I would not have gotten it if I had known about the space bar problem.
2,It's too big,"This keyboard is so big, that it takes so much space on my desk, I can't even have junk on my desk anymore. I hate the additional functional key, I accidentally press it all the time. Space key is so uncomfortable..."
3,Same problem as other Ergo boards,"This unit has the same problem as other MS Ergo boards: The split on the upper number row is in the wrong place, according to how I was taught to type. I was taught to use the right index finger to type the number 6 in the upper row, but this board wants me to use the left. If I were doing a lot of typing with numbers, as I have in the past, this would drive me crazy. Most of the heavy entry I've done has been mixed alpha-num, and I'm relatively fast at it.If MS had just put either a bridging key, or two 6 keys (one on each side) up there, it would make a world of difference!"
1,Cheap plastic,"After reading other reviews, I was excited to try a Microsoft 4000 keyboard. Once it arrived, I was very disappointed. Compare to the ergonomic keyboard that I bought 10 years ago (from Logitech), this is a cheap plastic that keeping making thug noises as I press the space-bar button. The space bar is also so stiff that my thumbs was sore after typing this review. I guess I should have stick to my old keyboard, than upgrading to this cheap Chinese made crap...."
3,Podia ser melhor.,"Parece que as teclas de espao tem um defeito de ocnstruo, pois enroscam sob a presso dos dedes. Outro grave defeito é o boto de ENTER logo ao lado das letras ser de tamanho reduzido. No mais o teclado é macio e funcionar bem. Recomendo um test drive antes de adquirir o produto, porque talvez o problema das teclas de espao sejm um problema apenas do exemplar que adquiri. Como a aquisio foi pela home page no pudemos testá-lo antes."
3,Extremely Delicate,This keyboard is EXTREMELY DELICATE. I've had two and both have gone completely haywire when I spilled an eight of a cup of coffee on them. Otherwise it's great keyboard.
1,avoid this keyboard,"I bought this after looking around for a nice ergonomic keyboard... unfortunately after using it i noticed the spacebar sticks. I guess if I would have read the 1 star reviews i would have seen this problem.Microsoft could fix this by splitting the space bar in two (a left and a right) so your thumb wouldnt have to push the whole bar down, only half."
5,great keyboard,I'm using this keyboard with my new compaq windows 7 64 bit and a 19 inch 4.3 acer monitor and love it
2,Bad spacebar ruins it,"Purchased from Amazon in December 2009; Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 400 has nice features and layout, and I really wanted to like it. BUT the spacebar is terrible--much too hard to press, especially from the left and right ends of it, where a touch typist normally would hit it. Mushy spacebar too. The keyboard is ergonomic for all of your hand/wrist except the thumb; I'd expect thumb discomfort/pain after a while using it. Returned it for a different keyboard. If you search the internet for the words _Microsoft spacebar fix_, you'll see that this is a common problem (but doesn't always occur--apparently some have this defect, and others don't), and that various people have tried various fixes, but none are really satisfactory. Wish I had seen this before buying it. Maybe a two-finger ""hunt and peck"" typist wouldn't notice this, but for this touch typist the problematic/defective spacebar is a dealbreaker."
1,Disappointed,"While I am enjoying some of the features of my new keyboard, such as the programmable buttons, I am still finding it difficult to type due to the placement of the keys. Also, it is a very wide keyboard, which forces me to place my mouse far away to the right of the keyboard. The worst problem I am having is with the hard touch of the keys, especially the space bar. Instead of solving the problems I am having with my neck and hands, I think it has made them worse."
2,TOO FIRM,"I give this keyboard 2 stars, mostly for effort. Everything is good about this keyboard except that THE KEYS ARE WAY TOO FIRM. I am surprised that the term ""ergonomic"" was allowed to appear on the box of this product. The keys are stiff, and the spacebar is agonizingly stiff. This product should probably be reported as unsafe as a result."
2,"Could be perfect, but three things are too bad","Everything is great on this keyboart, apart 3 crucial point:1. ""SLEEP"" button has removed been from this model by Microsoft. In a ""Green"" world fashion, this decsion of Microsoft is more then wierd. They saved $0.5 and lost me.2. The characters are rub off the keys fast. The Plastic is two soft, so your fingers are just erasing the prints by a regular use. It never happened to me with no other keyboards, even very cheap ones. Prepair to lost some of the prints, especialy the A, C and < characters- where you fingers are resting the most.3. The space bar has to be pressed near the center in order to work smoothly. The inside mechanizem just can't handle well pressing on the side of the space bar.Without these three isuues, this keyboard could be a superb top product.Btw, it was very nice if it had a USB hub, but it's not so critic."
1,Defective paint on keys,In only about 6 months the paint on the keys are worn off badly. About half a dozen keys I can't barely even see! The 'N' which really among all the keys is completely gone! And Microsoft DOES NOT stand behind their products saying normal wear and tear is not covered! So basically I am screwed and they would replace it but it would cost me more than I paid for it originally! I WILL NEVER purchase another hardware product from Microsoft since they don't stand behind their products anymore!
3,Not for touch typing,"I hate this keyboard. I've been a touch typist for many years, including on those with ""Natural"" keyboard layout, but never seem to find the right key on this one. Thumbs down!"
2,Nice layout but Very Stiff Space Bar,"I just got the keyboard this morning to replace my aging 10 years old MS Natural Keyboard. At the glace everything seem perfect for me. The lay out of the keys seem to fit my typing and I like the features that come with the keyboard. However after only few minutes I notice that the space bar is kind of stiff.Determine not to give up so easy, I continue using it for another couple hours (hoping that the space bar key may get softer or I may just get use to it). However after about 2 hours later I gave up. The spacebar is really too stiff!!. I started to feel the pain on my wrist/thumb. So despite all other stuff that I like about this keyboard, this one will definitely going back to the store tomorrow morning. I'm not sure this is just the defective one but given that several people report the same thing I will rather take my chance on different model/brand at this point."
2,"I Wanted to Love it, but coming from the Natural Elite, I couldn't.","I read the reviews about the spacebar, and found them to be true. The difference in pressure required distracts and gets in the way. The keys in general I found to be oddly placed, unreliable (sometimes a given key didn't work - not sure if that's the brand or the specific keyboard I had).Aside from that, the keyboard looks great, and I loved the palm rest. But as a keyboard, where the Natural Elite excelled, this one failed. Ended up going with a Perrix as a close replacement for the Natural Elite.I hope Microsoft gets their act together, their hardware is usually a pleasure to use, and well built."
3,It's okay,"This keyboard is good, when i saw it i was surprised. After 5 days, i think this item used not comfortable enough"
1,There's a reason its only $35.00 (which is overpriced by $34.99),"Two words - 'Utter Rubbish' - Avoid this product. after about a year of good use, random keys just stopped responding."
2,"Good features, poor reliability","I'm a technical editor and spend many hours at my computer. So, the keyboard is important. I really like the feel, arrangement, and features of this keyboard. So much so that I just installed my third 4000.And, therein lies the problem. My first 4000 had to be replaced after about 6 months because the ""X"" key stopped working. The second started sending random keystrokes to the computer after about a month. (It is interesting to watch your e-mail client decided it needs to create an infinite number of new messages.) I just installed my third 4000. If it doesn't prove more reliable, I'll look elsewhere for ergonomic keyboards.I give this keyboard five stars for features and comfort and one star for reliability."
4,Improvement over preivous version,"I had the previous ps2 version of this keyboard, and when it came time for a new keyboard I purchased this one. The function key remains activated (a fix from the last version I had). The right shift key sticks sometimes, but since I'm a lefty I don't notice much because I rarely use the right shift key.Key strokes are softer than previous version too.Over all, a good ergo keyboard."
5,A great keyboard,I love this keyboard. I can type faster and smoother with it. It's a beautiful black color which matches my computer and monitor. Once you type on a natural keyboard like this one you'll never want a another. It's a great keyboard and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great natural feel while typing.
1,Has potential but couple big flaws,"The sticking spacebar makes this keyboard useless. Oh, and some of the keys work intermittently. In particular, the Y key only works about 50% of the time. I've seen other reviews with these exact same problems so it's going back and I'll try a different model/brand."
2,"Good, but terrible space bar","As others have mentioned here, this keyboard is great with one exception - the spacebar! It is really ironic since the ergonomic form forces your hands to rest at angles, naturally drawing your thumbs away from the center of the spacebar. Any pressure at the outer corners of the spacebar causes the cheap plastic to warp and bind the plunger mechanism.I find it amazing that MS did not figure out that this spacebar is a complete piece of junk before it mass produced this device."
2,Space bar way too firm for small hands,"I have very small hands that type hard. The thing about this keyboard is that for some reasons, when you press the center of the space bar, it doesn't require much effort. However, since I have small hands I can't always extend my thumbs to the middle of the space bar, pressing the sides of the space bar now become painfully tough.The other keys felt tight as well. However, were it not for the space bar, it would have been acceptable. So I'm in total agreement with the other reviewers who said that the keyboard can be too tight for some users.On the plus side, this is almost a silent keyboard. For someone like me who can't stand listening to the typing sound of keyboard, this is a lifesaver."
3,Decent,"I bought this keyboard in hopes to have a replacement to the old natural that had the usb plugs in the back. Luckily i was able to find a few of those discontinued keyboards, they are the best keyboards ever. Anyway, Okay keyboard but it is BIG. I really miss the windows key not being located on the right side of the keyboard and only on the left."
1,FAILURE - Unusable spacebar,"The spacebar is stiff in the center and jams when hit at the sides. As the hands relax on the keyboard, the thumbs naturally tend to move inward. At this point, when the spacebar is hit at the upper left or right corner, it will jam. This will lead to wrist discomfort. I would need to make a constant conscious effort to keep my thumbs extended, and even then the spacebar would be stiffer than expected.NOTE: I have bought/tried this keyboard at multiple stores. This is a persistent problem that affects every keyboard that I tried."
1,Buy this keyboard only if you have thumbs of steel.,"This keyboard would be perfect except for one damnable flaw: the space bar is very, very hard to depress. The lower middle of the bar requires a reasonable force, but the left and right sides, particularly the upper left and upper right, cannot be depressed at all.Depending on your hand size and thumb position, perhaps this is not relevant. But for me the keyboard is completely unusable.I would not recommend this keyboard to anyone."
1,Sticky space bar did it for me!,"I have developed pain in my hands, mostly my thumbs from excessive keyboarding and probably some arthritis. I ordered this keyboard with hopes of improving my condition. I wish I had read the negative reviews closer. While there are many features that are good and the general feel of the keyboard is comfortable, the space bar was a deal breaker for me. My thumbs are already so sore, having to press the space bar so hard made my condition even worse! Sorry, but I will be returning it."
4,Good keyboard,"Easy to install. Very user friendly. Kinda noisy when typing. The only issue I had trouble with was re-programming the ""f"" buttons across the top. It didn't seem to work to change the features of some of them. All else works great."
3,Great keyboard as long as you don't use the space bar,I had been using my wife's Ergo Keyboard 4000 at work but got my company to buy one for me. The new keyboard feels identical to the old one except for the noisy space bar. And I mean noisy! My cube mates are complaining about the sound and one of them has the same keyboard. The space bar on the older models feels cushioned while the new one is plastic-hitting-plastic.If it were not for the cheap and noisy space bar I'd say this was the best ergonomic keyboard on the market but this is awful.
2,Disappointed by Microsoft for Once!!!,"I have been looking for a new keyboard for a long time. I figured it was time to try out this particular model. YUCK!.I could hardly type on it, and some buttons required that extra oz. of pressure to type. It was un-usually BAD! I therefore decided to take a trip to a local electronics giant and see what they had on display. My findings are that most keyboards now do not have the tactile feedback we are used to, they are however more quiet and soft to the touch. That being said, I found the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 with the Blue Trac mouse to be a better feel and it was easier to type. It has been ordered and will hopefully arrive tomorrow as a replacement.2 stars on this one, a new review of the 3000 in a few days."
4,Very comfortable,"I love this keyboard, very user friendly. It divides the keys into parts and helps you to keep your hands in one place. It also has shortcuts to your favorite folders. The disadvantage is that it was purely made for Microsoft and I use a Mac Air. For example when you click the shortcut key for mail, it takes to thunderbird and not the the mail for Mac. The other thing that I don't like is that it is so big and requires a lot of space. Otherwise I recommend it for anyone looking for a comfortable keyboard!"
5,Comfy Keyboard,"This keyboard it is great for a accounting work, very comfortable keyboard, working more than 10 hours a day on computer is soft to type with a great comfortable design"
4,Nice keyboard!,"Lots of features if you remember to use them. I do a lot of work at night, and the black keyboard isn't as easy as the gray one on which to find keys in dim light, but it does always look ""cleaner"" than the light colored one. I've been using the ""Natural"" style keyboards for years and now I can't type on any other kind. Very ergonomically friendly."
2,What A Shame...,"This keyboard has nice features. I was replacing an older MS ergonomic and wanted one with programming features.Problem... The damn spacebar!Takes too much pressure to use and has a loud CLUNK when you hit it. There was no model in the store for me to try or I would have passed on it. Just my luck.The regular keys are not bad, but after 6 weeks with the spacebar, I'm getting rid of it.How can MS miss the mark on this problem.Save your money, get something else."
1,Don't buy this KB,"I did some research and found some favorable reviews so I tried this one out. I had it for one day and went right back to my cheap, non-ergo keyboard (returned the MS4k shortly after). The keys are too difficult to press and the space bar is essentially unusable. Lest you think I just got a ""lemon"" I found many reviews on-line stating the same problem. I have since tried this one out in stores where I see it displayed, just to check. Every one has the exact same space-bar issue.BTW, after that I conducted some expanded research on ergo keyboards. I am currently using the Kinesis Freestyle split keyboard. I've used it for several months now and it blows all the cheap ergo's away, And the Kinesis really does relieve the stress in the hands and wrist from typing. I think amazon might even sell it.FYI, if you're serious about an ergo keyboard you really need to be prepared to spend a good amount of money (i.e. over $100)."
5,A great keyboard,"This is the second such keyboard I've owned. When my previous one wore out (it was one a friend gave me who had owned it for years but knew I had a pinched nerve in my elbow and so gave it to me to help me out), I ordered another one. It's wonderful. I don't carry it around with my laptop, but I do keep it at my desktop at home and it's marvelous."
2,Space bar sticks,This is a great design for a keyboard and an improvement of the older MS Natural keyboard EXCEPT that the space bar is horrible. It sticks and is unusable if not hit directly in the center. Read other reviewers' comments before buying!
2,I like my older one better,"Cons:--Finger placement detection (ridge on F and J keys) is insufficient. I'm constantly typing gibberish because my fingers are on the wrong keys.--Letters rub off the keys very quickly and no replacements are available--Occasionally keys are difficult to press--The keyboard is relatively largePros: It is very quiet, most keys are easy to press. Split design is effective at reducing strain.Overall: I like my older model Natural keyboard better."
1,Nothing like the old one,"this new and improved keyboard is horrible and has a totally different ergonomic design than the old white one. I disliked it from the get go, and have been using it now for a couple of months just to see if I'd get use to it. I haven't, and like another reviewer, the space bar doesn't work very well. This keyboard has slowed me down substantially and causes me discomfort. I am going to see if I can find one of the older keyboards. Like everything else Microsoft has tried to make better, IE9, Win7, they have made it worse."
2,Serious flaws,"I have had three of these in the office for about 14 months. On a positive note all three who use the keyboard have found it very comfortable to use. However, on all three after 6 months the ink on the letters began to wear off. After 14 months I am missing 10 letter keys. I do not really need to type but it looks bad. The keyboard is also very loud, there is a distinct and audible sound with every letter you type. This can be annoying when you want to type quietly while on the phone with someone.As a note be sure to press the grey button under the keyboard after you change the batteries, otherwise it will not restart."
2,Blind keyboard,"I've had this KB for about 3 years or so, but don't use it very much. I've found that the ""silk screening"" on many of the keys wears off - A, S, D, F, E for example. This is very annoying to me as I'm not a world class typist by any means. I need the keys to tell me what they are!"
5,Best keyboard I've ever used. Period.,"I usually type with 2, sometimes 3 fingers in each hand. I'm still a fast typist (for a regular guy who hasn't taken any courses or anything!)But this keyboard basically forces me to stop looking at my fingers every two seconds, and type with the correct fingers, without looking!It's also incredibly ergonomic and comfortable!! Wrist pain instantly gone! The only problem is that now I simply can't stand regular keyboards, especially Apple-style laptop keyboards!!Some people mentioned a problem with the spacebar being hard to push at the right edge. This is true, and it is a BIG problem... but I tried the fix that someone posted in one of the comments here on Amazon (take out the key and twist the metal bar by rotating both ends in opposing directions on its axis) and now it works almost perfectly, so YES IT CAN BE FIXED!Everything else is amazing. Buy this. I should have bought it sooner. My wrists are happy :)"
3,Should be 5 Stars,"I really wish that I loved this keyboard, and I really *almost* do. The shape is absolutely perfect. The space bar is almost a deal breaker. It seems like some people just get duds, which happened to me. Internet fixes work fairly well for a short period of time to make it bearable to use the space bar, but only just barely. I really suggest that you try out the keyboard, see if the space bar works and send it back for another if not before trying any fixes so you don't accidentally mess up your warranty."
4,* almost * perfect,"I am new to this keyboard and so far I like it. You can tell it is a quality item.I like that it is quiet. The wrist rests are very comfortable.I have been using a really small, scrunched up notebook keyboard for three years so this is going to take some serious getting used-to.The biggest problem with the keyboard is the space key. Unless you hit it close to its center ut doesn't go down easily. In fact if you strike it close to one of it's edges, like near the M key it seems to catch and takes too much resistance to press it down. Really that's the only fault I can find with this so far.The only other issue I have is that I learned to type on my own - and although I am a fast and pretty accurate typist apparently I did not learn the ""traditional"" way and this is causing me problems now. FOr example, I've always used my right index finger for the B key - This is simply not an option on this keyboard. So I have some re-learning to do. Hopefully it will be worth the effort."
2,I think I'll stick to my Thinkpad keypad,"The biggest problem is that the space bar has way too much resistance--far more than the other keys-- although I think all the keys offer a bit more resistance than I'm used to. NOT exactly helpful when trying to reduce finger strain.If you have small hands, this keyboard is not for you. I felt like I had to reach excessively for some keys, like ""y,"" ""control,"" and ""enter"". Also, the space/angle separating right and left halves seemed too big.Too big and bulky in general- though it is pretty light for its size.Ended up returning the product. Have yet to find my ideal ergonomic keyboard."
4,Good for six months,"Like most Microsoft products, the keyboards have ""lock-in"". Once you get used to the split, you can't go back to a regular keyboard and have to keep buying new keyboards from Microsoft. I got one of these in June 2006 and used it a few hours a day until January 2007, by which time a few of the keys were no longer reliable. It is a great keyboard if you don't mind having to buy one for every computer that you use and keep buying replacements every six months."
4,Small price to pay,"If you spend too long at a desk and the aches and pains associated with typing your life away are getting to you, I would heartily recommend this keyboard as part of an ergonomic make-over. There are plenty of other very competent reviews here that go into the finer points, but my 2 cents? It probably won't cure major woes on it's own, but with proper monitor height, foot position and all that jazz, I have certainly noticed a significant improvement. Bottom line my wrists and hands are more comfortable during the day and they don't hurt at the end of it. I'm also typing with greater speed and accuracy with this keyboard."
4,Listen to other reviews!,This is a great keyboard. But just like all others have said the space bar does take extra pressure to work. Its frustrating for sure. That being said I would still recommend it and probably buy another one.
5,Best keyboard out there,"I love this keyboard. Been a user of Natural keyboards for 10 years. So comfortable to type on. The big advantage of this keyboard over some others is that it allows raising the bottom of the keyboard.Only complaint is that the zoom control is not very usable. Works in some places but not others. Does nothing when hooked to a Mac. On Windows it will do things like zoom in the browser, but would love it to do full screen zooming.To counter the negative reviews that talk about space bar issues, I must report that was an issue with earlier versions. I have one from 2010 where sometimes the space bar is a little klunky. But I got one from 2012 for work and I must report that Microsoft has not stood still. There are no issues with the space bar on my new one. They also improved the texture of the wrist pad and the keys.So realize that the old negative reviews are not really applicable any more."
3,Why I returned it.,"Please understand that I am 80 years old and have slowed down a bit. I touch type and spent part of my hitch in Korea in '53 as a company clerk. This unit seemed to be well made and was comfortable to use although some of the keys did not easily compress. The biggest problem with me was that, because it was black and the letters engraved on the keys were faint , I had trouble typing in a half light. I could not always find my starting position and consequently began with a number of bad key strikes. The back-space key is too small and not easily found. I either had to return it or re-learn to type. I chose the former"
2,not very high quality - the keys are backed by easily broken membranes,this was a comfortable keyboard to use until the membrane key backings failed on one of the keys. i've been typing for a living for years and this was the first keyboard that i have owned that breaks after a few months
2,Great Features Bad Space bar design,"Features are great, however it has some issue where if you press the space bar on the top right corner, then it produces friction with the body of the keyboard. The friction thus causes the space bar to not go down at once or it causes the user to have to apply more (un-ergonomic) pressure."
3,Loud,I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep this keyboard. It's nice and comfortable but the space bar is SO loud... as loud as a typewriter. Very distracting for me and my office mates.
3,"Great fit, terrific keyboard but NOISY!","I had to move this one into a room away from the family room because the family was going nuts. This is like using an old manual typewriter it's so noisy! I'm sorry I threw out the box, as I would have returned it.I let the box go out to the dump the day this came in because I owned one of these already and loved it. Seems the quality has gone downhill. Guess I'm using the old one in the family room and hiding this one behind a nice wall.....too bad."
1,Garbage,"How do you mess a keyboard up? Just arrived today, the 'F', '5', and 'O' keys didn't work. Plugged back in the garbage stopgap keyboard I bought for 10$ from PC Richards (which doesn't require software installation).What a joke."
5,great buy,"Really nice keyboard.. takes a little bit of getting used to the keyboard being split, but it's very nice. Extremely fast delivery. I bought 6-7 items at one time and this package came first :) very happy"
1,Improperly listed,"I ran a search for PS/2 keyboards and this one came up. It has USB cord and will not function with a PS/2 adapter.Other than that it is probably a good keyboard, though it ruined my Christmas since it was the only gift I got."
1,Fail - space bar renders this unusable,"I tried using this for about 10 minutes today. I think there is some sort of engineering flaw, that made me decide against it. The space bar on this keyboard is an not user friendly, you have to push it with an extreme amount of pressure before it works and the noise is rather loud.You may have luck if you use it enough to loosen it up but I decided against that route and opted for a different model."
2,MS Keyboard 4000; WIRED,"I originally had a wireless MS natural keyboard and had consistent problems with two issues. First, there were intermittent periods when typing on the keyboard did not result in an appropriate on screen action. These periods would last typically for a few seconds. Second, there would be times when typing a character resulted in an action similar to what you'd get if you held the key down, i.e., you'd see that character run all the way across the screen even if the key was not being touched. This also happened with the space bar. Thinking that there was a problem with my wireless setup I purchased this WIRED MS Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000. Unfortunately, this keyboard does the exact same thing. It doesn't seem to make a difference which USB port the keyboard is plugged into."
1,terrible product - DO NOT BUY,"i bought this hoping it'd cure my terrible carpal tunnel, but its unusable because of the space bar. its POORLY MANUFACTURED and very stiff. so stiff, this is me typing with it:dont buy thisproduct beccause ther spacebar is complete crapthis productis conpleteltterri8bleahd the spacebar iiscausing an excruciatingpaininnmy thumb.yep. buy something else."
2,They changed the keys!,"I loved the feel of this keyboard, but ultimately returned it. After 20+ years of typing by touch I could not get used to the number 6 being on the left side of the board. I can't believe they changed this."
2,Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000,"I was disappointed in this keyboard for 3 reasons. First, I thought the mechanical feedback for the key press was poor. Some keys, particularly the space bar, required significantly more ""push"" than the others. Also, the space bar was particularly noisy when fully depressed."
2,Gee whiz got the better of me,"If your like me, I know what your thinking - ""Gosh, what an ergonomic look! It must make it a better keyboard, right?"" Listen, just because it's got a hump in the middle and a left and right hand keyset isn't going to make you a better typist - just more pissed off as your typing accuracy goes into the toilet. In all fairness, my family and I attempted to use this silly thing for several months and none of us ever made a decent adjustment to it. The only memorable thing about this keyboard was its ability to induce sane people to swear like sailors as they valiantly attempted to type on it. It now sits in a closet, unused and unloved. Microsoft, please fire the engineer that came up with this idea."
2,phlllaaattt!,"The rodent died rather quickly. Too bad, it was the better part of the set. The keyboard is only ok, and the USB antenna does not fit the USB ports in my new computer.Oh, yes, you need to like typing with the top of the keyboard much lower than the edge nearest you... not to my liking. Oh, well, now I'm off in search of another."
2,Space Bar Dealbreaker,Many people have written reviews making note that the space bar sticks unless pushed very carefully in the center. This space bar issues should not be overlooked as the space bar is probably the most used key in typing. I didn't look carefully enough at the reviews before purchasing and regretted it immediately. Returned it the next day. This is a warning!
3,It Types. What More Do You Need?,"I needed an ergonomic keyboard for my imac. Apple's keyboard sucks (so does its mouse, by the way). I was able to buy it from Amazon for about 35% less than in the stores. Great savings.Problems? Not exactly. Thing is, it's a windows keyboard so even though it uses a USB, none of the internet keys work with the imac, with the exception of the volume control, and that's disappointing. I'm a touch typist and I would love to be able to navigate the web from my keyboard instead of the mouse. But I can't with this keyboard and an imac.I guess my complaint is with Apple. I think they are failing to listen to their users, specifically regarding their keyboard and their mouse. Everyone I have spoken to about the mouse says the imac mouse should have a right-click button. I agree. And they should have an internet friendly keyboard.Anyway, this product does what I bought it to do, but looking at those dead shortcut keys all the time bums me out.Tom K.Las Vegas"
4,Very nice keyboard,"only weaknesses include a small enter button and the fact it is very large because of excessive waste of use of key space (especially the F1-12 buttons)Otherwise, this keyboard does help with your wrists. Get use to the B button on the left side and a stiffer space button."
4,so far so good,"I just received this keyboard today and so far it's okay. A couple of thing i have noticed is the space bar isn't as sensitive as it should be you do have to place your thumbs right under the b and n keys to get a consistent response when hitting the spacebar. Also the keyboard is big and it takes up nearly my whole keyboard tray. I also had to take off the incline in order to get it to fit, but aside from those two issues the keyboard is working just fine.. there's is still a bit of a learning curve though."
2,looks good but touch feeling is not good,looks good but the feeling of each key is not good. Especially space key is not easy to punch. And the sound of space key is pretty loud.It has so many functions itself but actually the feeling of key is most important than any other function. I cannot imagine a car which its stereo is fabulous but driving quality is bad.
5,Needs lighted keys,"I think this is a great keyboard with the ""wave"" and negative tilt to the key board my hands and arms are much more comfortable.My only complaint is related to a black keyboard, tilting away from me, making it extremely difficult to glance down and find keys in anything but the best light. Not a huge deal when you are a touch typist, but difficult for others especially if their vision is compromised at all.There are ""lighted key"" boards available, but they are all the pretty standard rectangle from what I can see.Fangy's wife..."
5,perfect,"typing on it right now, it works great, very easy to use, needed an instruction manual for a few parts on top, but didn't get one, but wasnt hard to find something online to help me out."
5,Relief,"I never felt my keyboard could be a contributor to the pain and numbness I felt in my right wrist and lower arm. My doctor suggested I try a more natural ergonomic keyboard and allowed me to use the keyboard in his office. Am I ever pleased! This is so easy to use, it follows the natural curve of my hand and the relief is wonderful. I would suggest this keyboard for anyone; even if you aren't on the computer all day as I am."
2,The space bar kills this keyboard,"This keyboard has a lot of great features (scroll control, etc) but the spacebar makes this keyboard unusable. I was hoping that the other reviews here were exaggerated. Unfortunately, they were not. The space bar is miserable to press. I returned this item and am using the Logitech UltraX Media Keyboard. It has laptop style keys and is a joy to work on."
3,Keys a bit stiff,The layout of this keyboard is great and very comfortable. I just wish the keys were a little easier to depress.
2,N key is wonky (a common complaint),It has been widely reported and I will confirm: The N key is wider than the other keys (to fill in space) and the mechanical trigger for the key is in the center rather than towards the right where you typically hit the key. This means that half the time you press the N key and you get nothing. This is especially annoying for me as I'm just learning to touch type. I have had it for 9 months now and it has only become more annoying.Comfort-wise it is a good keyboard but it's hard to appreciate when 50% of my N's go missing!
2,Don't bother buying this model,"The space bar is so rigid you will soon be pain. I took the space bar off and discovered it had so many pegs holding it in place that that thing isn't moving anywhere! Add to that the fit of the pegs in the holes is quite tight, causing the bar to be difficult to push even if you hit the bar right in the middle. The space bar will not loosen up over time."
2,Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000,The space bar is terrible because it sticks and it is to short and noisy. The delete and shift keys are too far to reach.
4,Microsoft Keyboard Review (Natural Ergo 4000),"I love alot of features about this keyboard, especially that you can tilt it, for those of us that spend hours online! It types very easily with a light touch, and only once in awhile, you have to touch key twice as you might not have touched it in the right place to have it type. It has many excellent features, and I use it alot everyday, so this is the one for me!"
3,sticky keys,"This is a very comfy keyboard -- a joy for the wrists. However, I found using the apostrophe and quotation marks very annoying -- there is a delay, i.e. the apostrophe/quotation mark does not appear until you have typed the next letter. Not the end of the world, but takes some getting used to. It's a small price to pay for the overall comfort."
5,Medical Transcriptinists' Review,"I have been transcribing for many years, and this means intense pounding on a keyboard for an entire shift. I was using one so worn that there were no identifying marks on the keyboard anymore. I hated to give it up for fear of losing speed and the soft touch, but IT was giving up. Having significant arthritis in my hands, especially the thumbs, I ordered the Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000 after entering ""soft touch keyboard"" on the internet. It was the first one to pop up. I am so glad I ordered this keyboard! It has some really wonderful features too, that are very useful to me in my work. My determination to hold onto an old keyboard caused me to miss out on features that will make my job easier. I'm very happy I switched, and would recommend this keyboard toboth casual and heavy-duty users."
4,It's this simple,"My wrists have hurt much less since I started to use this keyboard at work, where I spend most of my day at the keyboard. It took a couple of days to get used to it, but I love it now. I really like the extra hot-buttons - launch e-mail, browser, back, forward, calculator, music controls, and especially the backspace above the number pad (why hasn't anyone else done this?), but I don't have any use for the big zoom button in the middle. That would be much more useful as a scroll button. Other than that, I'm in love with this."
4,it's great!! . . .could use a few usb ports,This is the best keyboard ever! No more tendonitis! It would be perfect if it was 1. wireless and 2. had a few usb ports.
4,"Verry good, but.",This replaced their basic Natural Ergonomic keyboard. It is almost the same except - Too many features on this one (all I want is an I/O device to put thoughts into type). Otherwise I would have given it five stars.
2,Not for me.,"After using a Logitech Ergonomic keyboard and wearing out many keys (I work as a medical transcriptionist), I wanted to try the divided keyboard and go a little less expensive than the model of Logitech I had. I tried this keyboard and could not type on it! As far as a hunt and peck typist or for someone that speed doesn't really matter, it might be fine, but for someone who works on production, this one just did not work for me. Went back to Logitech which is not divided but has just a slight curve to the keyboard. Seller was great to deal with, emailing me a return shipping label so no problems there whatsoever."
4,Very good keyboard--sometimes awkward with blind reaches for keys. . .,"I've had this keyboard for about four years, and it's way more comfortable (and has lasted longer) than all of my other keyboards. There have been at least 5 others. The keys have a soft touch to them and press down more softly than a standard keyboard. I enjoy that it's black (wish it was backlit, but I'm spoiled), and I don't think I'll be replacing it for awhile. The ergonomic design is great except for blind reaches for keys (I'm a touch typer.).By the way, the part of this rating system where we're supposed to give stars for certain attributes has a misspelled word. It's ""incredible"", not ""incredable"". I won't fault the product for that, though."
3,Sticky Space Bar,"I bought this because this was a well rated ergonomic keyboard. Everything about it was great except for the space bar.The space bar's design doesn't allow easy depression from the corners of the key, so it was no longer ergonomic for me as I have small hands, so I had to push the space bar harder or try to hit the center of the key.None of the tweaks on the internet worked to make the key easier to depress, but my co-workers enjoy it, and it is worth noting that I have small hands.So if you push the space key with both thumbs, hit the center of the space key, or have hands bigger than mine, you probably won't notice an issue with this keyboard. Everything else about it is great. It's worth a try."
2,Not that ergonomic,"This is my third ergonomic keyboard and it's going back as soon as possible. The energy required to depress the keys (esp. the space bar) is considerable enough that it defeats anything gained by the improved wrist position, which any ergonomic (split) keyboard will give. In other words, it might help wrists, but still strains fingers, hands and elbows. My guess is that people rating it highly are mostly comparing it to straight keyboards. I'm buying another Fellowes ergonomic keyboard, which I loved until I spilled liquid in it (d'oh!). Those keys are incredibly easy to press and the back of the keyboard rises slightly so you don't have to reach as far for the top rows. I could type on that one all day. An hour or two with this Microsoft one and my hands are sore, my tennis elbow is flaring up and I'm not happy."
1,I want my old keyboard back!,"The previous Microsoft keyboard was great. After many years, it needed to be replaced. I thought this would be a reasonable replacement. They've moved some of the keys. Why? I'm constantly hitting Home when I want Del.Worse still, the paint has rubbed off many of the keys. Nothing at all on E. S and D are nearly gone. M is unreadable. C soon will be. L looks like I.Shoddy, shoddy, shoddy."
4,great keyboard,As advertised. It is a very comfortable keyboard to use and comes with software to help with zooming and other routine tasks.
2,Long history of good products spoiled by poor technical design,"I have used MS ergonomic keyboards since the original Natural Keyboard in 1994. I have been a huge fan of the line until this keyboard. For some reason, the keyboard I ordered from Amazon is nothing like the 4000 I've been using at my work for the past 2 years. This keyboard seems to drop keystrokes (particularly the spacebar) and there is no known workaround. Unfortunately, since this is an inconsistent issue with this keyboard, I didn't realize it was a problem until it was out of the time period that I could return the unit to Amazon.com -- so now I'm stuck with it.I have since replaced it with aLogitech Cordless Desktop Wave Pro. Aside from a slightly different keyboard layout which I'll have to get used to, I'm much happier with that keyboard -- no problems with the spacebar, very responsive keyboard, and no stiff keys aside from the function keys."
3,better than std keyboard but needs improvement to be called ergo,"better than std keyboard. requires software installation to work. should be plug and pay since it a MS on MS windows. space key doesn't work well unless hit with both thumbs or near dead center, sticks up when trying hit on top portion of the spacer bar. Zoom key is up and down, not zoom as in magnification. Have not tried all the functions but was only looking for an ergo keyboard to save the wrist. Jab when keyboard is used on the lap. Had for only 3 days, so can't comment on dependability."
4,Noticeable Difference,"I love this keyboard. It was extremely easy to install - up and running within 5 minutes. My only complaint is that the space bar is a little ""sticky."" You have to hit it pretty hard to get it to work which takes away from the ergonomics. Other than that, it's awesome. My hands and wrists do not get tired as quickly as they used to, and my typing speed has greatly improved. I highly recommend this keyboard if you spend a lot of time at the computer."
2,Great at first...but...,"I had always wanted an ergonomic keyboard. When I found one that I liked at a good price, I bought it. It has worked well for me, but after only six months, the lettering on 8 of the keys is wearing off! I do a lot of typing, and yes, I do know the keyboard well enough to not have to look at the letters, but come on...that's poor craftsmanship. I haven't had problems with the spacebar like many others have, though. (I'm not typing this review on the keyboard. I'm using my laptop.)The warranty from Microsoft said to return it to the store first. I did not buy it from Amazon (maybe I should have). I went to a local office supply store. Well, they would not replace it. Now I have the inconvenience of having to mail it back to Microsoft, paying for it myself, and waiting for a replacement."
3,Perfect except some points,"In general, it is a perfect model, good for wrist and the shortcut key is useful.However, I find some points that defect the my rating.1. The space bar is sometimes stiff, especially when you hit the edge.2. I think the keyboard split angle should be more than 12 degree because I feel a little unsatisfied for I still need to twist my wrist a little.After all, it is much better than a standard keyboard."
4,"Good keyboard, but takes getting used to","I have been looking for an ergo style keyboard for a while. I purchased two MS Ergo keyboards for a couple of individuals for the business but I kept using the ""standard"" keyboard. I began to notice a bit of pain in my right wrist. That's when I decided to purchase the Ergo Keyboard 4000.I have been using this keyboard for about four months and I like it. It takes a bit to get used to the hand position, my right wrist still wants to ""revert"" to old position. But I have notice no pain in my wrist since I started using this keyboard.I liked the ""web"" functions on this keyboard, however, I'm sure I'm barely using all the capability of this keyboard."
4,it's great!,they keyboard has already made a difference on my fingers and wrists-- it's a great investment! i would recommend it.
1,not functional for me,"did not like, all function keys did not work in windows xp they only worked in windows 7, did not like the style of the key board layout."
5,Comfortable and Ergo,I really like the feel of this keyboard.It is very solid and soft to the touch.The keys feel solid as you tap them and they don't wobble like other keyboards I have used.Very good quality.
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this keyboard, I am in school as a computer science major so I spend a lot of my time typing. It was easy to set up and comfortable, but then the batteries started dying and dying and dying. This keyboard just sucks battery power!"
3,Bad spacebar design,"The spacebar is difficult to press from the left edge. Plus, the spacebar is quite noisy. All the other keys are soft and quiet, while the spacebar is loud and clicky.The zoom control in the middle has no option to instead scroll."
5,Eased my work,"I work as a software developer and that was the main reason I got this keyboard.I rarely use the special keys so my focus is on the ergonomic and ease of work and this keyboard has definitely became my best companion during the long 9 day hours of work. It is extremely comfortable and also elegant. Many people take out the wrists holder but I prefer to leave them there and they are soft and good for my hands.My hand strain has diminished greatly.Pros: Comfortable, Hand holders soft, easy to clean, useful functions.Cons: Takes time to get use to, a bit bulky.Remember that even if you have the tools to make your life better, the important thing is to learn how to use them and in ergonomic part this is not an exception. So you have to position the hands correctly and still do some exercises, specially if you spent long hours with your fingers typing."
3,some of the keyboard features doesnt work,some of the keyboard features doesnt work but still i think its pretty coolits probably that i dont know how to set up
1,Unresponsive,"The keys at the center of the board, t and g are all highly unresponsive. If you are doing anything productive like writing words or programming, you will learn to hate this keyboard rapidly. If you are entering a password, you should just start crying.As a demonstration of how bad this product is, I will just repeat the above block of text using the keyboard without going back and correcting.'The keys at the center of the board, t and are all hihly unresponceive. If you are doing anyhin productive like, wriin words or programmin, you will learn to hate his keyboard rapidly. If you are enerin a password, you should just start crying.'Anyone else agree that block is missing some letters?"
4,Good product,"This is a good product, much better than the keyboard that came with the computer. I expect to get years of use out of it and am pleased with what I purchased. Unlike many product reviews, however, I don't think of this keyboard as a Wow. It's a tool and a useful one---which is somewhat better than some of the products I've purchased with the microsoft label on them."
4,"Spacebar sucks, but","I wish I had read the other negative reviews. I've had the same microsoft natural keyboard for the past 10 years and it's worked great and still works. I saw this one with its lift up in the front and bought one to see if it would help my wrists more.I love the feel of this keyboard, all of the keys are quiet and feel softer than my old one... except for the space bar. It clanks when I hit it and if I hit the edge of either side it won't move. I really with the space bar wasn't like that.Update.. I originally gave this 2 stars but I changed it to 4 stars to reflect the fact that I've kept it and the spacebar doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. There seems to be modification for it on-line to address the loud clanky space bar. I might try it later and see if it makes it as quiet as the other keys.You really can't get a better ergonomic keyboard for the money."
4,Great Value,"This is a product that I am very comfortable and happy using, and the value was excellent."
4,"Very Comfortable, Has Some Quirks","As a long time user of the original Natural Keyboard from the 1990's, I can appreciate the newer model for its simplicity and ease of use. I hope to have this new keyboard for another 15 years as well.Pros: Plug & Play with Windows XP, calculator button works with no extra software.Cons: Once in a while the keyboard itself ""crashes"" during bootup, forcing me to unplug and replug. There are several new buttons on this keyboard that I will never use or that don't even work without installing bloatware. In particular, I dislike the F-Lock key because it does nothing useful, but it occasionally makes all the F keys not work."
5,Microsoft Keyboard,Item received on time and well packaged.Works well and am happy with purchase.The keyboard is worth it if you are lookingfor a nice inexpensive keyboard.
2,"Cheap Ergo, Noise of space bar very annoying",Good overall keyboard if it wasn't for the space bar. It's loud and annoying. I'd say its worth it to pay a little more and get a better one.
4,Good keyboard,"I have only used the keyboard for 2 days now and it is definitely more comfortable than a traditional keyboard. I have never used other ergonomic keyboards so I can't compare it with others but it definitely feels more natural. All the keys are quiet except for the space bar which feels a bit stiff and makes a louder noise; hopefully it will ""break-in"" and be quieter.I am using the keyboard with Linux (kernel: 2.6.31 distro: Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala). Everything except the zoom switch works out of the box without any extra software. I have not been able to get the zoom switch working. All the other custom keyboard buttons work great though, they can be customised under the keyboard shortcut options as well, which is cool."
2,Poor customer service!,"I have had my keyboard 2 years. Within 2 months the lettering on the keys was wearing off which since I type by touch is not a big deal. Now the left riser foot broke. I called Microsoft to buy a replacement and lo and behold they do not sell them and wanted me to buy another keyboard. Seriously? I should spend another $40 for a keyboard because of a 20 cent part even though it is in the warranty period? What a joke. We are such a disposable society today that they would only sell me a new keyboard rather than let me fix it. Sure it puts more money in their pocket while taking it out of mine. Not a chance. It will be a cold day in, well you know, before I buy another Microsoft hardware product. Why should I as they would never allow me to fix it."
3,"If you type the number 6 with your right index finger, this keyboard might annoy you.","Why did Microsoft put the number 6 on the left hand side of the split, when typing instructors teach you to use your right index finger? This is the main flaw in the design of this keyboard. Otherwise, this is a good ergonomic keyboard for the price."
2,Space Key Sticks / Doesn't Work,Missed all of the other 'space key sticks' feedback. I really don't know why this was rated so highly... seems like poor design.
2,Hard to push down certain keys,"Love the layout and feels better, however certain keys require a lot of force to press, such as the space bar (right side requires a lot of force).According to others at this review site, this is a consistent problem with this model: [...]"
5,Great keyboard,"Not only is it comfortable and provides a handful of extra keys which are useful but it is also eye catching. I used a keyboard like this years ago but this one is way better, the padding on the front looks great and is comfortable. The layout of the keys and the ergonomics are leaps and bounds above any ""normal"" keyboard. I would like to see a wireless version, which would be a nice upgrade to an already great keyboard."
2,Ergo keyboard,"Didn't care for the ergo design. I'm a two fingered typist na the ergo design is too big and the hump in the middle spreads the keys out too much and slows my type of typing down, pluss the hump in the middle causes you to need light on two sides of the keyboard light on only one side causes shadows on the opposite side, if your a visual typist like me you lose sight of half the keys in a dimly lit room. If your a touch typist and use all your fingers and don't look at the keys it's fine once you get used to the hump in the middle of the key board, but I can type faster with two or three fingers than I can with nine."
5,Just as expected...,"I'm not one for replacing my keyboard until absolutely necessary, so the keyboard this replaced was at least 8 years old ... while the appearance of the keyboard is different, the overall shape and size are just as I expected in ordering a Microsoft Ergo Keyboard, which is what I wanted."
2,Issues with keyboard,"Unless the quality of the contact points for the m and i keys is just abysmal, I have to stab both hard to get them to work, even with the keyboard new. :(Add to that the keyboard wasn't in a MICROSOFT box, but in an aftermarket one full of bubblewrap, and I think it might be refurbished. :p"
5,Awesome!,"I love this keyboard! It has all kinds of useful shortcut buttons that minimizes the amount of times you have to go to the mouse. It's ergo design is a blessing for those of us with wrist problems. It's super quiet, too. I haven't figured out all it's extras buttons yet but I look forward to doing so."
2,Too mushy,"I used the older MS natural keyboard and like the bent configuration but the key response on this board is to mushy. You don't get a light, satisfying click from the keys. And, yes, the space key sometimes resists too much and feels like its sticking. Most of the additional buttons are useless (I do use the volume control). I've used it for more than 6 months and still haven't gotten used to it - I'm shopping for a replacement now. The insert/delete & page cluster is also different from the old keyboard which screwed me up from a long time."
2,Quality just isn't what it used to be,"This is the third iteration of same keyboard I've used since Microsoft forced the wonderful Logitech ergonomic keyboard out of production (as I understand it). Unfortunately, with each replacement keyboard (and they only last a year or so), the quality has gotten worse and worse. I had to return one of these as the ""b"" and ""n"" keys of the last one wouldn't type at all. This one has a very rattle'y spacebar and the keyboard touch has gone downhill. I'm still having driver problems where the quote mark won't type unless a space is pressed immediately afterwards.Honestly, if there was another choice out there, I'd switch in a heartbeat."
1,Very Poor Key Feel,I find this keyboard impossible to type on. The keys have a cheap plastic feel unlike the earlier MS ergonomic keyboards. It has the mushy feel of a plate full of overcooked spaghetti. As soon as I find a decent replacement this mistake will be shot in the head to put it out of its and my misery.
3,Not very ergonomic,How ergonomic is a keyboard that requires 5x the amount of force to push down the space bar as the other keys? I am very disappointed in this model. The previous white Natural Keyboard Elite was much more usable. This model is making my hands hurt. I am returning it.
3,"Ergonomic, but not ergonomic enough","Pluses: Best feeling wrist rest, ergonomically designed reverse angle, the zoom rocker and back/forward keys.Minuses: ""6"" key is on the wrong side, tough to press space bar.Typing on this keyboard should be enjoyable, but thanks to the above flaws, it is not. Design-wise it is on the right track, the wrists are less pronated because of the angle of the keys. I'm not yet suffering from CTS, but if it is already serious, I doubt this keyboard will alleviate all the pain. For prevention, however, it is already a lot better than a regular keyboard."
4,Good keyboard,"I am a graduate student and type A LOT, and the keyboard was really helpful to my hands and back. They don't hurt as much anymore. However, I did not take the measures of the keyboard and the desktop into accound, so the keyboard is too high for my desk (it gets stuck when I try to put the shelve back under the desk). It has the option to remove the front part that gives the hight, but that wouldn't help my wrists as much. The best would be if it could be adaptable; without having to remove it and put it back every time I want to use it. Also, some keys do not always work. For everything else, I love it."
4,Nice keyboard. Could be more durable.,"I just plugged in my second Ergo 4000 keyboard. The first one developed a stiff ""6"" key after about 18 monthes of use. I suspect that I hit this key at an angle, since it is rather far from my fingers when typing. That may have bent something inside the keyboard. My older Microsoft keyboards are still going strong after more than five years.I am sticking with this keyboard because it seems to offer the best ergonomics of any reasonably priced product. I have seen very exotic looking ergo keyboards, but they cost hundreds of dollars."
2,Not usable spacebar to me,"I brought the keyboard, returned it 8 hours after it arrived. The fatal problem is the space bar, it is very HARD to press if you hit it on corner. It would be great keyboard if the spacebar problem fixed.WATCH OUT, TRY it before buy. Many users on Internet reported this problem too"
2,Poor design of space bar,"Even though many customers wrote about the difficulty in pressing space bar, I went ahead and purchased this 4000 key board. I am regretting my decison for not listening to the people. You can not use the space bar of this key board easily. It requires some effort, and you can only press it in certain angle. Probably, even a cheap key board will not have this problem. I do not know how this key board with a well recognized design deficiency is being sold ."
4,spacebar is flawed,This is the most comfortable keyboard ever! I bought 5 of them. Unfortunately the spacebar is flawed. It's extremely hard to press on the upper left and right corners when pressing slowly...like typing while thinking. It's ok when pressing FAST. Greasing won't help as I've tried it. The flaw is at the design or more likely the manufacturing process of the spacebar key itself. There are 4 holes in the base but only 2 legs in the key so the whole key is not balanced. It should be easy for Microsoft to send out a corrected key for customer to replace. Let's hope they will do that.
2,space bar resistance hurts/stresses my thumbs,"The space bar has a lot of resistance, and after using this keyboard for one month, my thumbs are starting to hurt. Also, when I hit the space bar, I don't always get a space on the screen. I was hoping the space bar resistance would ease up after some use, but so far, its the same. I will admit that the rest of the keyboard feels fine. FYI, I am a small person, don't know if that has anything to do with my space bar issue."
2,"Good hand position, terrible key action.","I love the way that this keyboard feels to rest my hands on. Also some of the special keys (favorites, calculator etc...) are really useful. But that does not make it worth getting this board for. The keys are completely mushy. I have dealt with a lot of keyboards before that had this problem, but never to this extent. The spacebar only moves about one out of every three times I hit because it just kind of presses in, no snap or quick release to it. The Right hand shift is the same way. I initially had three stars on this product, but just because of the frustrations I am experiencing typing this review I'm dropping it down to two."
3,Good keyboard except for space bar key,"In general this is a good keyboard:* comfortable wrist pads* excellent ergonomic positioning of the keys* plug and play in windows 7 - I did not install the software that came with keyboard and all the keys I ever use work without it (including volume up/down, play/pause etc.One BIG con: the space bar is hard to press. You really need to exert some pressure on the space bar to successfully press it. Sometimes I want to take out my old Microsoft keyboard just because the space bar design is so poor."
1,GOOD IF YOU HAVE BIG HANDS,I bought this to help with carpel tunnel but it has made it worse You have to really push to use the keys and stretch like crazy if you have small hands i have made 6 mistakes typing this..nope 7..bad news for me
1,Died after 8 months,"Before purchasing, I read the many reviews that warned about how this keyboard stops functioning after a few months of use. I decided to chance it and bought the keyboard anyway. I hoped the durability issues were just flukes. Unfortunately, they are not. After 8 months of use, the keys stopped working correctly. Whenever I typed E, EW appeared. At first, I thought my typing skills were going bad. Then, the JK keys got stuck together. Eventually, the keyboard became completely unusable."
1,Flawed Design,"Nice idea - an ergonomic keyboard to help my suffering wrist. However, the keys were sticky and noisy, and the spacebar stuck about every fifth time it was struck. The stuck spacebar alone made the keyboard a failure. After returning and replacing the keyboard for the second time, (because of the spacebar) I realized the spacebar has a design flaw. You may also find that the wide keyboard means you reach across your desk to reach the mouse. I find the reach takes this keyboard out of the ergonomic category."
1,Bad purchase,"It did not work at all.this is worse purchase I have eversión done.WhenIt arrive the box was not even damage. Then I conected to the usb and nothing happened, not one letter work"
5,fantastic value,fantastic value. it really works and my hands are feeling better instantly. love the angle that it keeps your wrists. it works very well
5,Give it a week... it gets better!,"I didn't read any reviews before purchasing this keyboard. When I first got it out of the box and started using it I noticed that the space bar felt really stiff and was almost unusable. I searched online and found that a lot of other people had the same complaint. I went so far as to disassemble the keyboard and try and tweak the stabilizer bar. After reading a few accounts of people saying that it loosens up over time I decide to just wait it out.Well it's been about a week and this is by far the best keyboard I've ever used. It's different and takes some getting used to but after the initial break-in period I couldn't be happier. Microsoft really should have designed the space bar so that it felt great right out of the box or at least included a note or something to acknowledge that it feels almost unusable when you first start typing on it. Oh well, I'm extremely happy with this product."
2,"keyboard space bar keeps stucking and hard to press, easily snapped key caps","just horrible build quality, space bar especially the right side of the space bar have a high tendency to stick once pressed and won't return back into position.one day my cat walked on top of the keyboard and one of my keys just popped out of the socket permanently, not recommended, and going back to the elite keyboard"
4,Awesome keyboard - but why no wireless version?,"I bought this to stop the pain in my hands. I'm a computer programmer, and am on the PC typing all day. I needed relief, so my previous job reimbursed me for buying this. Just bought it for myself because I'm working at home now.Great keyboard. It's comfortable, types nice, quiet - so I don't annoy my girlfriend when we're both in the room.Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's not wireless. How could such a great keyboard, with today's tech not be wireless?!"
2,New Definition of Sticky Keys,"As a programmer, I spend 9 hours each day typing at a computer. Although the ergonomic style of this keyboard is nice and alleviates wrist pain by keeping hands aligned with forearms, the keys stick terribly on this keyboard and there are often several extra characters entered that I must go back and delete, slowing down productivity."
3,NICE KEYBOARD WITH A LEARNING CURVE,"This keyboard is well built and seems to be ergonomic, but if you are a hunt and peck type of person, its not for you. If you are skilled at qwerty typing, it will take a bit of getting used to, but I think you will eventually like it. It takes up a lot of desk space so if your cramped for space check its demensions first. Its very long. I passed it on to my kids and bought the Logitech Wave, also from Amazon.com. Going back to a regular style keyboard feels really cramped after using the 4000, but the way I type, its a better fit for me. I'm much faster on the logitech.Amazon's service is second to none, I usually get the free shipping which is always way faster than it says. Also, the 4000 has some nice features besides being ergonomic. With the software, you can reprogram any of the keys to your preference. The zoom in the center is nice, too."
4,Great product.,This is a product that not only looks good but is also very usable for people with limited use of their hands. The keys are spaced comfortably apart and the angle of the keyboard itself is angled in a natural way. Even with my arthritis I can type and use this keyboard with much more ease than the standard keyboard.
4,Better Than Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Pro,"I recently bought this keyboard as a replacement to my old Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Pro keyboard. This keyboard feels better, types better, and has a much more comfortable wrist rest. Actually, of any keyboard I have tried this one is probably the best. My only complaint thus far is that the spacebar is rather loud, but I'm hoping it will quiet down a bit after I break it in a bit. FYI, I'm using this keyboard on a MacBook and have not encountered any Mac issues, everything works so far!"
5,My Favorite Ergo Keyboard!,"I've been using Microsoft ergonomic keyboards with my Mac since the '90s, and this is the best one yet! Works great, and it's black!I've even got one at work, because my wrists cramp after more than a minute or so of typing on a regular keyboard. With one of these MS ergo keyboards, I can type forever without cramping. Fantastic!<update> I've owned this keyboard since it came out a few years ago, and it's held up fantastically! I spend hours per day on it and have had no problems whatsoever. The lightly padded wrist rest hasn't fallen apart or worn at all. Every part of this keyboard is in the same condition it was when I bought it. Eventually I'll probably throw it in the dishwasher and see how that works, but I won't do that until I have the money to buy a replacement, in case something goes wrong!"
3,Awkward spacebar made my wrists ache - defeats the purpose!,"I do not like the design of this keyboard compared to other natural/ergonomic models. I particularly dislike the design of the spacebar. It addition to being extremely noisy when pressed, the spacebar requires more pressure than an average keyboard to use. Because of the raised slope design in the middle of the keyboard, this is actaully causing the tendon from my thumb into my wrist to ache - and that is the first and foremost reason I use a natural/ergonomic keyboard. I am quite uncomfortable after writing just a few short emails and have to keep stopping to stretch my wrist. I will be returning the keyboard and trying to find another replacement that I like better."
1,Pressing keys esp. space bar is too difficult,I have been user of MS natural keyboards for over 10 years. I went through many of them esp. when I spilled water over.This one has huge problem and I am returning it back.The keys are harder to press than other keyboards (how can this be ergonomic?) and worst of all the space bar is very noisy and even harder to press.This is such a poor design.
2,Not what I hoped for,"I bought this with the hopes that it would allow me to use it as much as I need to and help alleviate my CTS discomfort. I tried the lift thingy, which I think made my condition worse, and I tried elevating it with the tabs on the bottom of the keyboard, but none of it seems to make a damn bit of difference. And like everyone else says, the space bar sucks and the keys are way too damn loud.I don't know what else to get, I'm tired of trying out keyboards, and I'm tired of the pain. I can't write as much as I used to/as much as I'd like to. I guess the only solution is to walk away from the machine altogether, and that's what I've been doing."
2,Meh,"Well.....its a wireless keyboard. I bought this for my tv room, computer is hooked up to the entertainment system. The wireless signal is so weak I had to by a USB extension so the keyboard would have line of site while I was using it.....pretty cheap Microsoft. Even with line of site the signal cuts out, and then comes back in periodically. I am only sitting 6ft away from the computer.....I would recommend looking elsewhere for a wireless keyboard."
1,Good except for non functioning space bar.,I am struggling to type this review because the space bar is so bad. I am going back to my old keyboard now.
1,Hate it. Had to buy another Natural Keyboard Elite (old style).,"I'm a medical transcriptionist who types 190 words per hour for 8 hours a day. My Elite broke so I replaced it with Microsoft's new ergonomic 4000. The space bar is difficult to press so when I double space, I only get one space. The function keys are farther out to the sides so when I reach for the F9, I hit F8 instead. I'm having a lot of difficulty striking the ""x"" and the outside keys that require the pinky finger (hand size issue?) I hate the new design so much that after 3 days on the 4000, I bought another ""old style"" Elite. For some of us a keyboard is like a piano. We need the design to be reliable and efficient and to stay the same. The 4000 is a big FAIL with me. I'm going to buy 2 of the old Elite style so that I have a backup. I have to replace my keyboard once a year due to wear and tear issues. Apparently, Microsoft only makes these things to withstand a year's heavy use."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I used to love the MS Natural Elite keyboard and was bummed out when I saw they had discontinued it. I was skeptical of this keyboard but I bought it anyways as a replacement to my old one when it broke and I can say I like it a lot. It's a little weird to get used to with the elevated write pad and the slightly different contour layout of the keys, but it feels good on my wrists. Here's a quick breakdown:Pros:- Updated ergo design with a better write pad and more natural contours- The arrow keys are arranged normally (no more weird cross pattern)Cons:- Key action is dull, the keys lack positive feedback"
4,good but not excellent,bad1. space is hard to press2. no drive for Linux3. key zoom is weirdgoodcomfortable and helps to cultivate correct typing habits
3,"Good, but not for small hands","I alternate this keyboard (which has a 10-key) with the Logitech DiNovo keyboard (more comfortable, but no 10-key). But I have small hands and my fingers get very tired on this keyboard. I'm always straining and reaching, and it's not nearly as comfortable. I think I'll end up going back to the MX5500 from Logitech. Loved that keyboard, but the keys only held up for a little over a year before getting really difficult to use. But I do lots of keyboarding."
2,Great if you don't need the space bar!,"The design is great! What a shame the space bar does not work, and makes noise. The overall quality is the worst. I would gladly pay more for this design that has quality build and a space bar."
5,Solid long-term buy,"I bought the Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000 from Amazon in December, 2007 and I've had it at my desk since. The ergonomics are very well designed for my hands, the typing is quiet and the keys well cushioned. 3 1/2 years later and I'm only now considering replacing it, and that's based solely on some of the paint coming up and that I don't feel like giving it a good cleaning. I have never had a problem with the board itself or the software. The mechanics of the keyboard are still very solid. I have definitely gotten my money's worth and strongly suggest this to anybody looking for a new ergonomic keyboard."
2,returned,"I returned this one and ordered Logitech keyboard. This one is really hard for me to use, guess it is designed more for game players."
1,Perfectly shaped piece of junk,"I loved the ergonomics on this keyboard, which is why when my first one died I paid the high price for a second one. Now, the second one has died, too.Isn't it just like MS to spend a fortune researching the perfect ergonomic configuration, and then they build it into a piece of junk that dies if you twist the cable too hard. So totally typical of them.I only bought it the first time because it was so well-reviewed. Well, I should have known better. Microsoft, you're never getting another cent from me, EVER!"
3,Needs more slant.,"I like the special keys for Zoom, Back, Forward, Calculator, - () backspace.The space key requires a bit more pressure from the thumbs, which I don't like since I have thumb problems.Also, I think the keyboard should be slanted more.It's an improvement from the standard keyboard. However, I wish now I would've spent more money for a keyboard that can be set to my specs."
5,( NO ) spacebar issues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have tried this keyboard in several local computer shops. I have not had an issue with the spacebar in any store, so i just bought it here. It is all about thumb placement. If you tend to have a small hand, i could see were you could have an issue. My thumb is comfotably placed zero to one inch max, left and right of center. If you are on the edge of the bar then yes it is stiff. I have used this for writing reviews here and reviews for my employees at work. This is a great gaming keyborad as well. You can make macros if your a macro hacker. I even bought a gameing keyboard called a merc stealth by steel series. I sent that POS back and kept this one.Final word:small hands = think twice about buying this.medium to large = dont think twice, just get it......If it is any help to size a hand. i can palm a basketball for 3 seconds.. LOL...Cheers....."
2,Buy OLD VERSION (Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite) Instead!,"The space bar on this new model is TERRIBLE. Old version much better, lighter, more streamlined...and the space bar (that indispensable key) actually works."
3,"Good keyboard, lousy construction",I just went through two of these. Each was done in by spilling a small amount of water on it. Otherwise a great product. Just keep your beverages away!!
3,Mushy keyboad feel,I have used this keyboard enough to wear/short out a couple; useful and well-thought-out design. But my newest replacement has a mushy feel to the keys--no life in them. Disappointing.
4,Better than the older version of the same keyboard.,"The only thing I didn't like was the odd plastic stand, I'm sure it's there for maximal ergonomic design but it was annoying so I removed it. The wrist rest is soft and comfortable a big improvement from the older white natural keyboard. All of the specialized buttons etc. seem unnecessary but are mostly harmless."
5,"Great for your arms, wrist, + fingers!","A bit weird looking...but great for your hands. It has a cushion for the bottom of your palms. Plus, it has great shortcut keys on top."
5,This is the most awesome keyboard out there,"I did lot of research before buying this keyboard, and yes some of the things that are mentioned in all of the previous reviews are true ( hard space bar key ). But, I have still rated this keyboard with 5 stars as it's simply the most awesome keyboard out there. My fingers feel like they are at home, and they love me for me that :)Give it some time to get used to if you are like me and haven't used ergonimic keyboards before. But once you do, you will love it."
5,Lovely item,"My hands feel like home, very confortable ergonomic, this item is perfect.... except for the little ""issue"" pressing the space bar at corners..."
4,"OK, little bit cumbersome","Generally OK, but little bit cumbersome on your lap (on desk it is OK). Keys travel is OK, but not the smoothest keys I used."
2,Buy a better Keyboard,this is my 3rd one of these they dont last long and lead to sloppy typing with the key shapes spend a little more if you like split keyboards and buy a Fellowes instead it works is the best that can be said for the microsoft keyboards
2,Bad for small hands,"I have really small hands, and after 3 weeks of using this keyboard, my finger joints are in pain whenever I type. I bought this keyboard to potentially avoid an occupational hazard, but it seems this keyboard itself IS the occupational hazard. The size of this keyboard is built more for guys who have larger hands, and I find I have to constantly move my hand around or stretch my fingers to reach all the letter keys. Don't buy this if you have small hands (for comparison, my tiny hands are the same size as my 13 year old sister's)."
2,"looks nice, but not a very reliable keyboard","i bought this keyboard about 1 yr ago. this morning, after a routine cleaning, the enter key, both shift keys and the question mark key stopped working. i tried a lot of things to fiz the problem, apparently, the letter 'aks' stops working as well. anyway, in the end, i realized it was the keyboard itself...i remember when i decided to purchase this keyboard, even though the price of this keyboard was on the high end of all the keyboards that were available. however, i felt like since this is something that im gonna use everyday, i might well just spend the money and buy something thats going to last. but now, just after using it for little for a yr, the keyboard is done.... i mean the keyboard looks nice, big, easy to use, but in terms of reliability, it is pretty poorly constructed...."
2,Space bar ruins it,"Everything feels right, but the space bar is so stiff you have to SLAM it to make a space come up. Not cool for the most common key on the keyboard. I don't want to solve my wrist problems by creating thumb problems. Pretty much useless."
2,"Great idea, very poor tactile feel","Over the years I have had many, many Microsoft ergonomic keyboards.The model 4000 arrived about a month ago. The design is good but the feel of the keys is poor. The action is at times very coarse and sometimes they hang resisting depression. Additionally, some keys are easier to depress than others which interferes with typing.Clearly, the bean counters have been at work at MS and have cheapened up the key action significantly. Not acceptable at all. More junk from China."
2,Very Ergonomic But Unreliable,"I'm already on my second keyboard of this model, after the first one stopped working after a only a couple of months. The second just started giving me problems after 2 years of easy service - not acceptable.Though the design is very comfortable (though takes getting used to) and has been able to relieve me of wrist pain, the unreliability means my next keyboard will be a Logitech."
5,I've bought 5 of these... not because they're broken...,"So I do a lot of typing. I work in technology and at every job I've had in the last 5 years, I've made sure to get one of these keyboards along with my Logitech Performance MX mouse. This is my go-to set up on every computer I use.I love the wrist riser and how it keep my shoulders comfortable while I'm typing for hours on end. I'll admit, it took me about 2-3 days to get used to the split keyboard deal, and you have to be able to type... but it's a CRAZY good keyboard, it's quiet and I've found that I actually type faster on this than I ever could on a straight keyboard.get it... get it now... you won't regret it and you won't go back"
5,Only slightly less than Perfect!,"My decision to purchase this keyboard was based on a glowing review by someone that had been using his keyboard for a few months. I was seeking a keyboard that was quiet and ergonomic (fatigue-diminishing and user-friendly). My old H-P keyboard, after 4+ years of daily use, had become so ""clattery"" that it was a nuisance; plus, I'd worn the lettering off several keys! This new keyboard, though not 'whisper-quiet,' is definitely quieter. It took 2 or 3 days to get used to the different hand positioning and smaller ""Enter"" key, but was a breeze to adjust to. I'm hoping now to find a quieter Mouse! Would recommend this to anyone using a keyboard for several hours each day and in need of the relief provided by a soft-touch keyboard and quieter keystrokes."
1,misrepresentation of ergonomic benefits,"The main space bar is very sticky, as one would learn from the numerous searches people have conducted on Google to learn how to fix it. In fact, there is no easy fix. I have found that using this stiff bar has exacerbated my thumb pain. Now Amazon will not allow a return since I'm past their very short return period. I don't know what warranty rights an Amazon purchaser has with respect to Microsoft. Shouldn't Microsoft fix this product, rather than continuing to sell it?"
2,Keys too Hard Especially Space Bar - My fingers started hurting - Looking for alternative,I was excited about the keyboard. I noticed on day one that I need a sledge hammer to use the space bar. But hoped that I would get used to it. Used it a few months. But my fingers have started hurting. Going to dump this and hope to find one with softer keys. I don't recommend this.
4,Pretty nice keyboard overall,"Thought this keyboard was really nice when i bought it.Pros: Palmrest, this has got to be one of the best palmrests i've ever bought since it's not made out of plastic for a change. It's got this leathery feeling to it which is nice. The programmable keys are really good to use, although i find it kind of hard to type on the keypad once in a while because the palmrests are not extended long enough. Price! This keyboard is pretty quiet too.Cons: I've been using the comfort curve 2000 and well, for the typing part, that one is still better. I find the keys a bit hard to depressed compared to keyboards. Not just the space bar key like other people have been saying, but i find most of the keys on the keyboard are hard to depress."
1,Highly disappointed,"When I received the keyboard, it was, indeed, stunning looking and feels really comfortable to type. In under 1 minute, I noticed that the Space-bar keeps getting stuck and repeating itself until I hit hard again. Without a working Space-bar, the keyboard is useless, no matter how comfortable it may be.So, I contacted Microsoft Support. Yes, the immediately created an order for a replacement. That was nice.After 2 weeks, nothing happened. So, I tried to chase down the Support personnel and there was no response. I created another trouble-ticket and they claimed that their system is having technical issues.Oh well, I guess I am just out of luck. Bad keyboard, broken Microsoft Support Tracking System, what more do I need to make my day.I am spending too much time on this broken keyboard. Don't bother considering this keyboard. There seemed to be a design flaw in the space-bar. I am not the only talking about this issue in this site."
5,out standing,I am a first time typer and this keyboard is so easy to use. I was afraid that my wrist would hurt but they don't. I would and will recommend this product to my family and friends.
3,"Not very durable, but otherwise excellent design.","I purchased several of these for business, maybe around a dozen. They are excellent in feel, and superior in use but not prolonged in their durability. I have been using older microsoft ergo keyboards for years without issues, but these ones seem to have a few issues the buyer should be aware of:*The lettering on the keys WILL wear off and do so FAST. We have multiple employees who have used white out to draw on missing letters. I do NOT have this issue with ANYONE else unless the keyboard is VERY old.*The larger keys tend to lose their ability to stay properly centered. This causes keys that feel wobbly and rock side to side slightly, and it can be quite annoying. The spacebar in particular becomes very loud as a result of this.*2 people have managed to pop a numpad key off that will not go back on, may or may not be product at fault."
4,Best keyboard style,"I have been using Microsoft natural keyboards for a long while now. They are really comfortable to use, and reduce the strains that typing all day can place on your hands, wrists, and arms.They are built quite well and stand up to almost any abuse. However, they have one weak spot: water on the keyboard."
1,Terrible spacebar,I have tried two of these keyboards. The space bar is hard to push and actually will hurt your thumb. Within a year the space bar got so bad it's was no longer usable. The quality is not as good as olderMicrosoft Natural Keyboard Elite.
4,Good keyboard,"I've used a Microsoft Natural Elite for 10 years, and I've switched to this one after having a couple of the old ones die. I like split keyboards, though I've never tried any of the high end ones. I would say the keys feel softer on this one compared to my old one, and I think I can still type a bit faster on the old one. However, I think this is a good replacement and with more use will likely be just as fast. The specialty keys (e.g., calculator) are nice, but I'm not using them much yet since I have to look at the keyboard to find them.Disclosure: I work for Microsoft, but I have nothing to do with any of the hardware and have been using Microsoft keyboards since before I joined the company."
5,Years of use,"I have used this keyboard for over 6 years now. I have purchased one for work as well as home. Even after years of use the keys are still crisp and responsive. I use the keyboard for up to 12 hours per day up to 6 days per week. Clearly I would recommend this keyboard to anyone that spends many hours typing code, copy or emails each day."
2,Keys are too hard to depress which causes typos,"The keys require too much force to depress, and are too thick, which makes it difficult to type fast without creating typos. The shape is good though."
1,"High Failure Rate - Bad Keys, Bad Spacebar - Take if from an IT Support Tech!","I work at a large institution where we install many of these keyboards. Our users seem to like the ergonomics, but that is about it.These keyboards suffer from poor quality (made in China like everything else these days) and I've got a stack of bad ones sitting beside me that have to be thrown out due to non-functioning keys. I've also had users complain about sticking spacebars (yes, even on relatively new keyboards), and they just don't seem to hold up.You've been warned - these things are poor quality and you're taking a risk buying one. Or you could buy two, so you have a spare when the first one breaks. The only trouble with that, is I don't believe in rewarding companies for making bad products by simply buying more of their garbage."
1,Beware - the Space Bar complaints really are True.,"I read all the reviews on this keyboard, so I went to Best Buy to get a feel for the unit before buying it from Amazon. I just received it. Installation was a breeze. The construction is satisfactory. The keys have a good feel. The Space Bar is utterly annoying. I know many people have written about the Space Bar, but I couldn't believe that it could be so loud....and the one in Best Buy didn't seem so loud during that trial. I noticed that if you depress the space bar with your left thumb, that it isn't so loud. Also, the space bar requires much more push than the rest of the keys. This is being returned tomorrow."
2,Severe Flaws,"As often mentioned, the spacebar on this keyboard is stiff and loud. I have been using my keyboard for six months now and there has been no change in that. Additionally, the ""h"" key does not work properly on my keyboard. This key is slightly elongated to fit the ergonomic design, but if I don't press down on the far left side of this key, it doesn't work.Were it not for these two flaws, I would be very happy with the keyboard. It is very comfortable and the price was right."
2,Very pleased when it works,"Being somewhat handicapped, I love the way the 4000 helps me position my hands. However, I have had multiple times that groups of keys stop working or single keys will hang giving me a string of single key inputs. MS Technical has helped me once to correct the problem - and I am waiting for assistance again. This is very concerning for what I considered a 1st class keyboard at a first class price."
2,NOT wireless,"Even though this keyboard looks exactly like the wireless keyboard I needed to replace, and it is listed second when I searched for ""wireless ergonomic keyboard"", this keyboard is NOT WIRELESS! I really liked the keyboard I had, but had a tragic coffee accident when trying to change the batteries. The wireless keyboard uses a usb transmitter, so when I saw usb, I, non tech dummy that I am, assumed it was the same. It was not. It doesn't use the standard keyboard plug,which would have been acceptable, but needs a precious dedicated usb connection. It went back immediately, now it looks like I'll have to buy the keyboard and mouse package if I want to replace the one I ruined."
2,JUNK,"This keyboard was advertised as wireless. It is not. Although the ergonomics of this keyboard make it very comfortable to use, the space bar sticks which makes typing a pain in the butt! I probably would have kept this keyboard were it not for the sticky space bar. I type too fast to have to deal with that problem."
1,Horrible Spacebar Issues,"I would NOT recommend this keyboard. The spacebar sticks, cutting your typing speed in half. I don't understand the good reviews it got here on Amazon, because reviewers on other sites also claimed to have issues with the spacebar."
1,Don't use it,"I don't use it, Just not use to this type of keybord, Might be ok if you used it but I don't want to look for the key all the time"
4,"Comfortable, but got to get used to it","Going from a flat, regular key board to this extremely comfortable keyboard, takes some getting used to.Other than the learning curve pain, the only problem is the space key sticks a bit and you have to bang.Overall, it is very good."
2,Disappointing,Keyboard response is stiff/sluggish - especially the spacebar. Not the easy touch keyboard I was looking for. Returned for refund.
1,Same fatal flaw - bad space bar,"I went ahead and got this in spite of the reviews, hoping I would get a keyboard with a decent spacebar. But, no, it's just as everyone described. It's hard to hit, clunky, noisy, and causes thumb pain within minutes. I'm hoping the replacement may be the rare ""one in however many"" that actually is ok. The only good thing I can say is that at least Microsoft has good customer service, because after just half an hour on the phone, they're sending a replacement keyboard."
2,Bought and returned after 3 days,"I returned it because the space key was excessively noisy when pressed (a very loud clunk) and required excessive force to depress. It was annoying and slowed my typing down dramatically. (I'm also not sure I like the ""split"" design, but I probably would have gotten used to that.) NOTE: at a local Staples, I found an example of this model (albeit much more pricey at $49 on sale marked down from $59) which when I tried it hands-on had a much looser and quieter space bar ... maybe Microsoft has fixed the problem, but the supply chain still has the defective ones on sale. Conclusion: don't buy this keyboard sight-unseen, but if you can buy it in a store for a reasonable price and it doesn't have the loud space bar, then go for it. Just make them open the box before you buy if possible, because if you get stuck with a noisy one, you'll lose your marbles."
3,Great for the patient typist,"I have enjoyed this keyboard for quite some time now. It does take a little getting used to. However, once your fingers get adjusted you'll effortlessly flow through all of your typing endeavors."
2,Don't Buy If You Have Hand Injuries!,"While the curve of this keyboard is nice, the keys are WAY WAY WAY too hard and stiff to the touch. A decent ergo keyboard should be a light touch, which is critical if you're healing from RSIs. This is awful. I'm returning it."
5,Very Good,"I use ergnomic keyboards because they reduce my pain from tendinitus, an important consideration as a touch-typist and programmer. I use the same keyboard at work and like it so much, it was my first choice for home use as well. The curve and rise of the keys are more extreme than many ergonomic keyboards, but once you adjust to it, it feels very good--the pain and tension in my forearms eases off immeidately. I also prefer USB keyboards to wireless, since keystrokes aren't encrypted, and could be easily monitored by someone in the street, not a likely occurrence, but still a consideration."
2,Be careful with the space key,"space key is too hard to push down.This make my thumb more tired. Also, this type of ergonomic keyboard doesn't work for people using the keyboard with one hand, such as ""layout engineer who use one hand for mouse"". The floorplan make it extremely hard to reach each key with one hand."
3,Meh,I'm typing this review on the keyboard in question after about five months of use.The S and A are now barely legible and the space bar sticks just like everyone has claimed. I didn't take my keyboard apart to try to fiddle with the springs etc.The zoom roller in the middle of the keyboard doesn't ever seem to do anything productive. The one button I've used quite a bit is for the calculator. It's nice to just pop up the calc without having to Start/Run/Calc.exe. But I could have just drug it to the quick start area of the taskbar and had similar functionality. I suppose I use the mute and volume adjustment buttons as well rather than messing with the taskbar icons for the same task.Overall it's ok but nothing to be too excited about. Typical China junk.
3,"Keyboard is too large, spacebar is agonizing","My fingers had started hurting when I was on my regular Dell keyboard for several hours during the day. Decided to go for this ergonomic keyboard in the hope that it would be easier on the fingers and wrist. This keyboard is more ergonomic no doubt, my fingers hurt a lot less on this. However, the keyboard feels too large, and I often find myself stretching to press the keys. I guess it'll take some getting used to, I've had this for only a week or so. Like some other reviewers have posted, the space bar is ridiculous. I have to jam it every time I need to use it. Maybe I just got a defective on, or it's possible that it will become softer after some more use. If the problem remains, this item is going back. Overall, a nice product, does what it advertises, but these 2 issues make me think twice."
2,The Vista of keyboards,"Like other buyers say. It looks good, but it's too big to comfortably use a mouse on the side. The key action is too stiff, the programmable keys are not really programmable, and the space key sticks on occasion. It's a keyboard, and the space key sticks! That's enough to make it the Vista of keyboards."
2,Didn't like the key response,"I didn't like the way the keys or the space bar responded, all very stiff & noisy. I type a lot of data into spreadsheets & need quick and accurate response, but this was the opposite - stiff, slow, somewhat clumsy under fingertips, and large. You know how you just want to feel no resistance, or noise - it wasn't this model. I even let my teenager try it to see if he wanted it before sending back, but he also couldn't stand it, and we immediately put it back in the box, it wasn't up to par, so we are returning. The one thing I liked was the built in gel wrist pad, that feature should be kept and the rest of it thrown out. If they would purchase a better designed keypad and put it in a smaller keyboard and use the same gel wrist pad, it would improve it a lot. Do you need to hire me to engineer it? :)."
2,LETTERS RUBBED OFF,"I don't use this keyboard THAT much, but after a year or so, the letters on the keys rubbed off. Annoying."
4,Excellent Keyboard,"I have had this keyboard for a little over a year and it is an excellent keyboard. I like the black with white lettering. I have had no problems with it over all.The only drawback is that within the last 3 or 4 months the silkscreen on the keys has been coming off so that 4 of my most widely used keys are completely blank now. I will probably have buy some stick on letters and numbers for the keyboard. If not for that problem, I would have given this keyboard 5 stars."
3,MS Natural Keyboard 4000,"This product is almost great. It's quiet and comfortable with the notable exception of the space bar. The spacebar hasn't been designed correctly and when pressed from the side deforms and restricts the spacebar from being being selected.I have added a weak spring to the right side under the spacebar and that has helped quite a bit, but come on Microsoft, can't you engineer a solution to this known issue?"
5,Love it!,"I ordered this keyboard to use at work and loved it. I've had it for about 6 months and no longer have any wrist or shoulder pain. Because I thought it was so great, I bought one for home. I highly recommend this product."
2,"natural ""not""",Maybe this keyboard just isnt for me. But the keys are sort of sticky because of the way it is shaped and the placement of your hands. I've been typing on it for a month now and I really would rather have a regular key board. Bottom Line it sticks and it is uncomfortable.
4,"Good keyboard, with a few flaws","I'm wondering, after reading these reviews, if Microsoft didn't put out a newer revision of this keyboard. The keys do not feel stiff at all, they're light, very quiet, and responsive (for the most part--see below). Space bar is not an issue for me at all.What IS an issue is the M and N key don't always register, at least on my particular unit. I'm typing along, and one of my words is ""missig"" the N. And for some reason, the N key is the loudest key on the keyboard. Also, on one occasion, the "")"" key stopped working entirely. I could type a ""0"", but holding shift to get "")"" didn't work. Rebooting fixed it..very odd.Maybe the keys are stiff, and I'm just used to crappy keyboards. :) I'm a fairly fast typist (85-100wpm or so), so if anyone has suggestions for a comfortable (ergonomic), highly responsive and fluid keyboard, post a comment here."
2,"Spacebar sticks, not great for small hands","I was hoping this keyboard would help me with shoulder pain while typing. The spacebar is very stiff and oddly designed. You have to hit it at just the right spot and at the right angle or it sticks/hits on something below it that does not give. Very painful over time to my shoulders and very disruptive to my normally fast typing. I should also say that my fiance, who has large hands, felt the spacebar was a problem for him as well. But I found that in general my hands may have been too small for comfort with the layout of this keyboard. I also found that the keys were not as comfortable to hit over time as I had hoped. But the spacebar was the real ""sticking"" point that got me to decide to pack it back up today in order to return it. Very disappointing."
1,"Not for touch typists - non-standard hand for number ""6"" key","As a skilled touch typist accustomed to the standard keyboard layout, I was surprised and disappointed to discover that this keyboard forces you to use your left hand to reach the ""6"" key.Microsoft decided to make the ""7"" key twice as wide, and move the ""6"" key to the left side of the split layout -- where the right hand cannot reach it.This to me is a fatal flaw. If you don't touch type the numbers, maybe it won't bother you -- but if do, or if you share the keyboard with others, they might find themselves mistakenly typing ""7"" when they meant to type ""6"". I did this a few times already, but I'll be replacing this keyboard with something better as soon as possible."
1,"too stiff, doesn't like macs","The space bar is much too stiff on this keyboard (especially on the right side). After about 5 minutes of use, I decided to return it. It also doesn't work well with macs despite the install package (which requires a restart). Under the microsoft keyboard config utility, it claims that the function keys belong to Mac OS, but don't do anything."
2,Typers alert!,"This keyboard looks beautiful, but don't be fooled by its appearance. Keys are very hard to press. Several keys that you will use very often are even harder: The space, backspace and enter key. It really hurts my hands after using it for less than 10 minutes. Although I ordered it from Office Depot yesterday for a surprisingly low price - $22, I am returning it. A cheaper keyboard, Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 is much better, although its ""Backspace"" is also stupidly harder to press than other keys."
4,mostly good ergonomic keyboard,"I bought this keyboard to replace an old crappy logitech keyboard/mouse set, and so far its alright.pros: good number of keys, with extra buttons thrown in as wellquite comfortable to usehas a pretty nice built in wrist-restcons:the damned spacebar wont depress properly if dont use allot of force if you hit it near the top of the keythe spacebar is LOUD it will go CLACK CLACK CLACK as you are typing while the other keys are quietits bulkytakes a bit of getting used to due to the curved design and the keyboard being split in twooverall, its a pretty solid keyboard, and the gripes I have with it are mostly minor, the only con that really gets me is the spacebar, given that its a US style keyboard, the space button will be used a ton since english uses spaces often...ill see if I can pry off the spacebar and use some WD40 or something, im not sure if it will help or not."
2,"Very ergonomic, but a big flaw","First of all, I am not a traditional typist, I do a lot of ""two finger typing"". It did slow down my typing speed a bit but not as much as I anticipated. I could see myself getting used to it, The key layout is very comfortable. I like the soft feel of the keys and it's not terribly noisy, like my Dell L100. But one attribute kills the potential beauty of this board, the space bar, which is one of the most used keys.You have to hit space directly in the middle in order for it not to have a sticking feel. If you try to press it from the sides it takes a lot more pressure. You have to hit it hard then it seems to slam down, highly unacceptable and annoying when you are trying to type fast.If it wasn't for the worst space bar design I have ever used, this keyboard would easily get 5 stars. But I must give it 2. I also read that the lettering on the keys wears off after a short time. This I did not experience for it took me a day to realize that it must be returned."
3,Good buy,"So far so good! I just bought the keyboard and it works well. Some keys are sensitive while others need breaking into. Overall, I think it is a good buy."
2,Was Satisfied - But Buttons stopped working,It is a great product. No complaints. Got used to the new shape pretty quickly. I don't have any problem with the space bar as such.Update 5/7/12: A few buttons stopped working on the keyboard abruptly (buttons j-k-l). I am yet to deal with the warranty/support stuff. Will update once I do it.
5,Love it,"I absolutely love this keyboard. I had the older version, white, and it was great, but getting old and was very outdated. When that one finally broke, I checked a few sites to compare prices and Amazon had a low price for this product and the best shipping options."
5,Fantastic keyboard-the pain is gone!,I got this keyboard after hearing Marco talk about it on his podcast. I had been having some pain in my left wrist and thought I would give this one a shot. This keyboard is great. It looks a little funky with the piece that raises the front edge up but boy does it feel great. Your wrist stays straight inline with your arm. All of my pain is gone now. The space bar is a little bit loud while all of the other keys are very muted sounding. I also love the calculator key. Very handy for me.
5,"Great keyboard, takes some tome getting used to it, bulky","I'v had this keyboard for over 6 years now and I love it! It is really simple to use once you get used to the keyboard split. It makes my typing much quicker. Cleaning it is also pretty simple. There are instructions online how to do it. So far I'v cleaned it about 3 times, and each time it comes out looking brand new. The ""calculator"" button on top comes pretty handy too. If this keyboard ever breaks, I'll probably get the same exact one again. The one downside to it is that its pretty bulky and takes up more space than a standard keyboard. Either way I highly recommend it."
3,Space key is poorly designed,"I'd like to report a couple of issues with this keyboard:- Space key is poorly designed. It takes different amount of effort to press it: easiest in the middle,hardest at the left and right edges (almost getting stuck)- It's higher than a regular keyboard so it doesn't fit into my keyboard trayOther than that it's ""more ergonomic"" than a regular keyboard - it takes noticeable less effort and finger-bending to type."
3,Space key is too stiff,"I purchased this keyboard for my wife who has been partial to Microsoft's ""natural"" keyboards since their first beige beauty from the 90s. Unfortunately, the keys on this model, particularly the space key, are too stiff. I had seen complaints about the stiff keys in other reviews but was hoping this was not a universal problem. The good news is Amazon's great return policy, and I ended up getting the cheaper Natural Curve 2000."
1,broke 2 weeks in.... very unhappy,We purchased this keyboard. I have one in my office and purchased one for the house. The one purchased was refurbished and broke 2 weeks in. Certain keys quit working and had to break out the old keyboard.VEry Unsatisfied.
3,Feedback,The keyboard in not quite what it looks like in the picture but then this is understandable. It is not as good as the previous one I had it will take a little time to get used to it. Thank you for following up
1,Failed After Two Months,"I purchased this keyboard for Christmas 2012. It is now the end of January 2013. The keyboard has failed. While it was working I liked it, but the key touch is amazingly soft. I like a keyboard with a click kind of touch. I have an Apple and the keyboard just stinks. Nonetheless it keeps working. Failure after two months just isn't acceptable.What to do? Looks like I'm out the bucks because Microsoft built a crummy keyboard. My wife will try and send it back. Hopefully, Amazon will stand behind their products. They always have.AD2"
3,Meh,"Yes. Space bar. You have to press it closer to the middle or it won't move. That's the biggest disappointment. Some keys started to wear off after half a year, not a big issue. Most people don't look at the keys anyway."
1,Trash it before buying,"I use Microsoft keyboards for many years and I was always happy until this keyboard appeared. It feels great, it looks good but it's just not working. I've owned 2 keyboards in row. On my first ""H"" button breaks every 2 month and I have to use my screwdriver and clean the keyboards, all the insides are very cheap and unprotected. Anything inside keyboard can prevent a button from functioning.Then I've decided to buy one more keyboard. A month and a half later ""Y"" key is barely functioning. So if you have better things to do than unscrewing and cleaning your keyboard, choose anything else. I still have noname keyboards from 95 and all of them still function excellent."
1,Crap!,I'm an I.T. Engineer for a hospital and have gone through literally a hundred of these. The characters rub off the keys after about three months of constant use. Quite often the space bar sticks or keys fall off the board altogether. A piece of junk for the money.
1,"Good, but the space bar is a deal breaker","All but one of the keys on this keyboard are great. If this was the tilde key, I would love this keyboard. Unfortunately, it's the space bar. The actuation for the space bar is at the center of the key, which isn't necessarily the cause of the problem, but it certainly doesn't help. My previous MS keyboard (I believe it was the Elite), actuated at the center also, but the key was designed in such a way so as to allow it to be pressed anywhere quite easily. On this keyboard, the space bar has to be pressed very near the center in order for the key to work. Even then, it has to be pressed quite firmly, and it makes a very loud clicking noise. Seeing as how the space bar is used more than any other key, this is unacceptable. I am returning this immediately."
2,Nasty space bar,"The loud and sticky space bar ruins what would otherwise be a wonderful keyboard. All of them seem to do this (per other reviews) It is a function of the fact that there is one switch in the center of the space bar and the force at either side of the bar causes it to rack to that side and twist the guide above the switch, increasing the energy needed to push the bar down. (The torsion bar doesn't do its job.) Then it makes a loud noise when it hits the bottom. I would not want to use this in a public setting. Since I like the layout, I'm going to try to fix it, but I have a machine shop at my disposal. If I didn't, I'd throw this away."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this keyboard for 3 reasons. First, I thought the mechanical feedback for the key press was poor. Some keys, particularly the space bar, required significantly more ""push"" than the others. Also, the space bar was particularly noisy when fully depressed. Second, the ergonomic design of the keyboard was quite pleasant, but the spacing and the sizing of the keys (some letter keys are larger than others) made typing a bit difficult; larger hands may find it a bit easier going. Finally, the web quick access button did not permit programming any other browser to open other than Microsoft's Internet Explorer, even bypassing the default browser (FireFox) set up on my computer. Other buttons could be programmed for it, but not the button labeled for the Internet. For those 3 reasons, I returned it since it was going to be too frustrating to live with it."
1,bad for RSI sufferers,"I've had a pretty serious case of RSI for quite some time now and have tried many keyboards. for the last 2 years, i've been using the microsoft natural keyboard and can definitely tell that it's much better on my wrists than an ordinary flat keyboard. unfortunately, my natural keyboard is starting to act funny, so i bought the natural ergo keyboard 4000. i had high hopes because it looks nice, i like the reverse tilt (i often roll up a towel and put it under the front of my natural keyboard to create the same effect), and it seems to have some nice feature.unfortunately, i'm going to return it to the store primarily because the keys are just too hard to push -- especially the spacebar. it's actually hard enough on my hands that as i started to type this review, i decided to stop, unplug the ergo 4000, and use the natural keyboard instead. maybe the keys will loosen up with time, but i can't afford to aggrevate my RSI in the process."
1,Used previous natural keyboard...,"I have 2 10 year old natural keyboards with the old keyboard layout and when I saw this new keyboard with the same layout I bought one. Sadly, this keyboard is painful to use. The keys - especially the space bar - require far more force to use that my previous keyboard. I am a software engineer and used to typing but this keyboard has slowed my typing rate and wears me out after 20 minutes. On the shelf it goes for emergencies as I'll continue to maintain my old keyboard."
5,Works Like a Charm,"I have had this keyboard for just about a week now, and find it to be the best keyboard I have ever owned.I have had no problems at all, despite the numerous people who have complained about the space bar, mine has been just fine.I love the shortcut buttons, a real convenience for me."
5,I'm really liking this keyboard,"This is my first ""ergonomic"" keyboard. I wasn't quite sure if I was going to like it, but it is forcing me to learn to type a lot better. I really like the ""hot keys"". I used to assign keyboard combinations to desktop shortcuts, but pressing one button is a lot easier than having to press ""ctrl+alt+(and some letter) to open a folder or file. I also like the =, (, ), and ""backspace"" keys over the number pad. I do a lot of work in excel and this makes formulas a lot faster to input once you get used to using those keys."
3,Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000,"While I'm sure others may think this is a great product, I didn't like it. I couldn't get use to the design and it was hard to press the 'space' key. I had to press it twice for it to work."
2,Cheaply made,"Although keyboard has nice features and is well laid out, the space bar only depresses in the center. Apparently this problem is wide spread amongst buyers as it is well documented on google. You would think Microsoft would offer a replacement part to fix such a common problem."
1,Got 2 and Space Bar did not work on either one.,"I tried getting a replacement for my first one which had a broken space bar. The 2nd one had a space bar which did not even move. I wrote a long review and Amazon did not post it. Bottom line, stay away from this keyboard! You will only have to return it. It did not even come shrink wrapped and looked used. I said a lot more the first time, but Amazon likes to censor any negative comments. I use to be 100% satisfied with them, but not after this experience!"
4,good keyboard. arrived with NO literature to explain its features. Buttons whose purposes remain a mystery are why its not a 5,"seller should have included literature or a website to find it.As far as I can see there is nothing wrong with the keyboard at all, unless the mystery buttons don't really work."
3,Comfortable keyboard but the spacebar is crappy,"This keyboard is very comfortable and has decent pricing. But I had to return mine because of an iritating problem with the spacebar. The spacebar key is springloaded in the middle and if you hit the key on the ends it is a little hard to press down. If you type fast, then some spaces might get missed. I returned my first piece and got another one but it had the same problem. But I dont think all pieces have this problem because a friend of mine has a piece on which the spacebar works ok.I just want potential buyers to be aware of this issue. Apart from this I liked the keyboard. Sad that I had to return this.Edit:-----I have this keyboard at office now, the spacebar is working much better on that (it could be better though)."
4,Better than earlier versions...,"I have owned MS Ergonomic keyboards since they were first released and find this one to be better than prior versions in several respects. The keys are much easier to press and the keyboard is tilted up at an angle so the front part is higher than the back part which reduces pronation of the wrists. As some others have noted, it is annoying that they changed the size of certain keys but I am not finding this so difficult to get used to. It is INCREDIBLE that they have a back and forward button integrated into the keyboard right below the space bar, so it is no longer necessary to go through enormous repetitive motions to press the back button in a browser. This may be the greatest feature of this keyboard! But, most importantly, it is more comfortable and easier to type on than any prior version or any other product I have tried."
1,The letters are too small - and they wear off!,"The split ergonomic design is a big plus, but there are two major downsides that make this a very poor product on balance:(1) The letters on the keys are too small. You have about a full half inch square available - why not use it?? Why must you put tiny letters in the upper left hand corner? Are you not aware that some users have problems with vision?(2) Worst of all: the paint wears off. If one types fairly regularly on this keyboard for a couple of years, the white paint on the keys telling you which letter is which wears off to the point that you can't even see them! At least that's true on the letters one's fingers hit most often. All you have left are your mechanical habits dictating what letter to hit when, and they are often not enough!"
3,"...Or, Tie Some Weights To Your Thumbs...","It's a great keyboard EXCEPT for the spacebar. The spacebar requires an unusual amount of force, compared to the rest of the keypads. It's frustrating to hit the spacebar and get nothing; and then have to hit it again, harder. It's a design flaw. The spacebar keypad measures five and one-half inches in length but is only most responsive at its center. The keypad is less responsive away from its center; until it tweaks or is completely stuck. If you have heavy hands and gorilla thumbs you may not have a problem. The keyboard seems durable enough for that. Otherwise, I would not recommend it for frustration-free typing."
3,"Solid, responsive keyboard but not without a few caveats","I'm largely happy with this keyboard but will note several caveats:* The media keys do not provide next/previous track keys* The elevating skirt to raise the front edge of the keyboard is awkward to add/remove and is cheaply constructed* The keys are quite responsive but are a bit louder than I think they need to be, particularly the spacebarErgonomically this is the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used. The construction (other than the elevating skirt) is pretty solid and I expect this keyboard to last a long time."
1,Causes hand fatique!,"The keys are very hard to press - within 1 minute of typing, I am already feeling cramps in my hands. It's going back to the store tonight!"
1,Beware- keys stop working after a while,"We use these keyboards at work and I think they feel great *when they are working*. Unfortunately, after a while some of the keys stop working (i.e. I press the key but get no character on the computer)! I took a couple back to the IT people at work and they said people are returning these keyboards all the time and I should try a different model.I now have 3 dead keyboards on my desk: one with a broken 'C' key, one with a broken 'Y' key, and another with a broken space bar. Great."
1,Microsoft should recall this keyboard,I am returning this keyboard.Product:Microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard 4000 - advanced ergonomic designModel:1048Reasons:1. It is not ergonomic design by any means2. spacebar is hard to press when you actually type .3. your fingers/wrist might experience pain if you use this; It happened to me.you wont understand what i say if you simply try this keyboard in stores. you actually need to type a document using this and u will know why the keys make it hard to type. it is amount of pressure needed to type a key is different when u press them individually vs while typing a document when all fingers are in use.-Don't know which ergonomic evaluator approved such wiered keyboard.I would give it ZERO stars if I could.Suggestsions for Microsoft:1. split the space bar into two buttons to atleast make this keyboard usable.2. reduce finger pressure required to press all keys specifically spacebar.3. increase the size of enter button. and reduce size of most keys.
3,Nice Keyboard - Bad software,"Keyboard works great, nice feel. Software did not work on my system (XP Pro). Caused keys to not type, therefore passwords were not recoginzed. Was just about to send it back when I thought of uninstalling the software that came with the keyboard and that did the trick....so if you have or plan to buy this keyboard....beware of the software included!!"
3,MS Ergo Keyboard 4000 review,"This new model is a significant improvement over their older (white, ps2-plug) edition. The soft textures have the feel of high quality. The keys have a sure over-center action. Easy installation with USB connect. The only flaw: a sticky space-bar key. Perhaps problem will fade after it's broken in a bit. I am surprised this particular unit was allowed to leave the factory. The unit I purchased last year was perfect.--- Computer Tech for a US Govt office ---"
5,Great Ergo Keyboard,"This is the best keyboard I've used in a long time since the IBM Model M Keyboard. I've used this keybaord for over a year now, and I really enjoy using this keyboard. I was getting pain in my wrists from the ""slab"" type keyboard provided by my employer. I switched to this, and the pain went away.The specialized keys, can be programmed to do any number of tasks. I've had no trouble with the keys, or spacebar.It is my favorite, and I will be purchasing another. I use one at work and at home now. It is Mac and Windows compatible. The software, to configure it, is easy to use on the Mac. I completely recommend this keybaord."
5,One Of The Best!,"I looked at a lot of ergonomic keyboards and this one had the best features for the price that I could find. It even has a semi-cushion pad to rest your palms on. Pretty nice. I was concerned about some comments concerning the space bar. It would probably be better if it was divided into two, but I have not had any personal problems with it being hard to press since I have fairly large hands.I only wish it had previous and next buttons for windows media player (as I use WMP a lot). It does however have forward and backward buttons auto-programed for the browser between the palm rests. It was easy to re-program them to be previous and next for windows media player.I like this keyboard so much and find it so comfortable that I am getting a second one for my house (got the first one for work)."
5,don't bother looking at any more keyboards,"Absolutely love this keyboard. I haven't tried every keyboard on the planet, but I would bet a large pile of cash that this is the best one!! The keys are super easy to press, and the palm rest is way comfortable. I do a serious amount of typing for my occupation, and I notice a positive, substantial difference at the end of a long day. If you have to type extensively, this is the keyboard you want to purchase."
3,Microsoft Keyboard,I purchased this keyboard a little over 3 months ago and already the letters are coming off the keys and the spacebar sticks.
5,"Great, tough keyboard","I've owned two of these keyboards & love them. It is comfortable & in combination with a good chair w armrests, helps prevent repetitive motion injuries. I work on this keyboard 8-11 hrs/day 5-6 days/week. This last keyboard is 5-6 years old & going strong. I've cleaned the keys out every couple of years & have taken it apart & dried it out after coffee tried to kill it. A year later it is still working. Some keys have the paint worn off, but don't really need the labels.The only problem it has is loosing it's connection, despite being hardwired, at times. Since there isn't a better one out there & the 7000 wireless keyboards have problems with keeping connected, I'll stay with the 4000 when this keyboard needs to be replaced."
5,Awesome Keyboard,I love keyboard. Everywhere else wanted over 100 dollars for it. My brother has the same one and I had to have it.
2,key malfunction,"Because i discovered a malfunction in the keyboard ,I contacted , Microsoft and they were considerate enough to send me a,BRAND NEW KEYBOARD,free of charge.Because I couldn't contact Reforger,Thanks God for Microsoft.Also the malfunction was in the,two2,L,key,zoom,key,didn't work.Sorry you didn't know of the malfunction,didn't know a person had to purchase as is.Do more refurbishing before sending products out.Thank YouProfit Adams"
3,Mrs.,"The keyboard is fine, but the software that comes with it modifies the mouse software already installed. The result is that the click rate (like the double click rate) is increased to the point that it is unacceptable. Being that I did not purchase a mouse, it took some time to realize that the keyboard software was the 'culprit'. Once I did and set the mouse software settings back to 'normal', all was well. Until then, I was pulling my hair out trying to find out what was going on."
3,loud space bar!,"get the old natural keyboard (the white one) if you can find for a similar price. JUST DO IT!the finish on this one may look good on the picture, but it's not. The plastic arm rest is just awful (but better than the white plastic if you work in a cold place... but if so then you have other problems to focus)and i laughed at the reviewers saying about the loud spacebar... until i got the keyboard. And i'm used to IBM model M!!! the space bar on this one is LOUDER. and with an awful press feeling. just awful.other than that, just hate that microsoft messed up on the keycodes for the zoom keys. would be nice to use them for scrolling. maybe next versions of Xserver and kernels will be able to handle that.follow the bug for the zoom keys [...]"
3,"Ehh...it's just ""alright""","I purchased this product hoping that the keyboard would be somewhat quiet and ergonomic. It isn't much quieter than my previous regular Dell flat keyboard I upgraded from and the space bar SUCKS. The space bar is very NOISY and it's a known issue that it gets jammed. I would not recommend dropping money on this to anyone even if it's for $20 (which is what I paid). It's not terrible but it's not worth extra money, my Apple keyboard at home is much less noisy but I guess the ergonomic part is definitely the upside. If you type fast, it'll be noisy on this keyboard so if you're looking for a quiet keyboard, PLEASE DO NOT buy this keyboard."
2,Squishy and unreliable,"6 months ago, my workgroup purchased 10 Microsoft 4000s. Two of them have already died, and the key decals are disappearing from the rest.Compared to the originalMicrosoft Natural Keyboard Elite, the 4000 has a much less accurate key response (it feels ""squishy""), and the larger distance from the right side of the keyboard means your arm has to travel farther to reach the mouse, making ""mouse elbow"" more likely.Bottom line: Skip the 4000 and go with the Elite. The extra features you get with the 4000 (like the zoom controller and soft keys) are marginal at best and don't make up for the lack of reliability."
3,Good but much unneccessary and keys lose lettering,"I have used natural keyboards for a decade now and they have truly saved my wrists which were getting carpal tunnel syndrome. This black 4000 board is okay but it has a lot of unneeded keys - no big deal. What I hate is that I am wearing off the lettering from the A,S,D,C keys and others are starting to show wear. I never had that with the old white keyboards."
1,Space bar too sensitive...keys repeat..pretty much unusable,"Just resting my thumbs on the space bar causes repeated spaces to be typed. Seriously, I don't even have to press the space bar, just touch it, or breath on it. At first I thought my keyboard was possessed and I could barely type anything legible. I also have problems with letters and keys being repeated, even though my fingers are off the keyboard. The delete key has this behavior as well, which has caused me to inadvertently 5-10 emails until the delete button decides to unpress itself. I give up!"
1,space bar sticks - not happy,I had high hopes for this product but turns out to be not well made. The space bar sticks and got a replacement. The replacement I got doesn't stick as much but it still sticks. I tried using this ergo keyboard but it hurts my wrist more than the typical keyboard. I type a lot and this is not something I would recommend. The right side of the keyboard is too wide so you have to reach further for your mouse. I would think Microsoft will have a better product than this. I like my other microsoft products (hardware) but this one is not worth fifty something dollars. The $10 or $20 keyboards are better.
1,Paint on keys wear off and not covered!,In only about 6 months the paint on the keys are worn off badly. About half a dozen keys I can't barely even see! The 'N' which really among all the keys is completely gone! And Microsoft DOES NOT stand behind their products saying normal wear and tear is not covered! So basically I am screwed and they would replace it but it would cost me more than I paid for it originally! I WILL NEVER purchase another hardware product from Microsoft since they don't stand behind their products anymore!
1,space key problem,"I want to like this keyboard and overall I think it has a very nice feel. But the space key is very difficult to press down. Hunting through reviews, I noticed quite a few complaints about this (some reviews going back to 2007) and Im guessing that some of the keyboards have the problem some dont -- luck of the draw. Regardless we all know what a keyboard should feel like (and if MS puts an ergonomic on the box I expect it to feel better than that), also this problem has been around for over a year and they are still shipping keyboards with the problem. A design flaw with the keyboard and a inability to manage quality in the MS hardware group."
2,"Big, bulky, and clunky","I accidentally spilled some water on my ergo keyboard last week and the control key and ""c"" key were out of commission. I purchased the 4000 and tried it out as a replacement. The keyboard is huge. If you are using a computer desk with a slide out keyboard tray, this monster will either scrape underneath the desk or not fit in at all when you try to slide it back in.There are lots of bells and whistles such as programmable keys and the sort, but these are more of a gimmick than anything else. The key response and placement are ok, but it's easy to mistype because of the angle of the keys.After two days, I returned this keyboard. It has a nice wrist cushion, but overall, the feel of the keys, the unwieldy over-sized footprint, and flimsy keys don't add up to a very good typing experience. The Microsoft Natural Elite runs circles around the 4000.Oh, and after two days, my keyboard dried out and works fine again."
2,Same problem as many have had; stiff spacebar,"I like everything about this keyboard except the spacebar. It is way to stiff to be comfortable. I hate to return anything, but I have no choice. The spacebar is annoying as I write this review."
1,unhappy typer,"I am returning my ergonomic keyboard. After five minutes of using it, my right thumb was hurting from hitting the space bar. You have to get it in the right spot or it won't go down without a lot of force. The ""good spot"" on the space bar is an unnatural position for me, so the keyboard goes back."
2,Not as comfortable as per reviews,I ended up returning this keyboard as it was not as comfortable as all the reviews mentioned. I do part time transcripts so have to use my keyboard a lot and did not feel this would suffice. Some keys were hard to push.
2,It looks Cool....But That's About It,"I've had the same exact experience with this truck as all the other moms here. I loved the idea of this toy. When my son opened it up he was thrilled. He tried to play with it right away, but the mechanisms are not easy to operate. You have to flip up the ramp to direct the cars to a different level. Some reviewers said they had a hard time figuring it out. I never figured it out. And the cars....I can't tell you how many times my son would cry out in frustration and I'd have to fish out stuck cars. All in all, I can't recommend this toy. It doesn't fulfill it's purpose. It's supposed to be able to be filled with cars, hauled around and unloaded. The entire time we had this truck we never, ~ever~ played with this without a tantrum from my 3 year old because there was more ""fixing"" than playing going on. I wanted to like this toy, because it's cool and I knew my son would just love it. But folks, honestly, it just doesn't work."
4,Great choice,"If you are a Markham fan, or just curious about him, don't miss this one. I bought it mainly for Lincoln, but there is so much more!"
5,Just listen to the drum intro. to Alligator Boogaloo...,"....that was reason enough for me to search the world for this disc. Idris Muhammad (Leo morris) is one of my all-time favorite drummers- this guy can hold down some of the funkiest grooves I have ever heard. This is a Live album that also includes: Melvin Sparks on guitar, Leon Spencer on organ and of course Lou Donaldson on sax. This is like a super group line up- these cats can groove like no others and when it comes time to mellow out a bit they can bring it down a notch. I found this one on the internet from a records shop in the UK. So if you want it, I wish you all the luck because this one is a keeper."
5,The Scorpion,"All it takes is to check out Alligator Boogie and really know what soul/funk/jazz is all about, if there is such a thing of course. The lineup speaks for itself! A little organ here, drums there, sax there... You know the drill!"
5,Good stuff,We got this collection when we got married 7 years ago. I was glad to find this extra bowl on Amazon since the product has been discontinued. These bowls are nicely made and have a great look for everyday use.
4,On My Way,"On My Way is Ben Kweller's sophomore release, and definitely shows that Kweller is on his way. On My Way was recorded almost entirely live with the band in the studio, in contrast to the polished over dubbed style of Sha Sha, and it shows in the raw style of songs that permeate the album. The hard rocking songs are more so than those on Sha Sha, and `The Rules' in particular is an energetic romp which gives the listener an urge to fully rock out. When it comes to touching guitar ballads, `On My Way' is the `Lizzy' of this album, and as far as piano ballads, `Different But The Same' and `Living Life' are each gems. Overall, all of the songs on the album show Kweller's impressive songwriter's touch and this one is definitely more than worthy of a good listen."
4,Listen a few times...,"When I first bought this CD, I thought it totally sucked (compared to Sha Sha, which was so incredible...) but after a few listens, I couldn't stop listening to it. My favorite tracks are especially ""down,"" ""hospital bed,"" and ""believer"" BUY THIS CD."
3,not great,"I really, really wanted to like this cd. The first time I listened to it, I hated it. It was the song On My Way that bugged me the most, because when I was four I wrote a song just like it. He talks more than sings the (three note) verses, but the lyrics are probably the best on the album and I feel like they're wasted. I listened to it again and decided it's not so bad, but none of the songs really stand out that much, like Wasted and Ready or In Other Words did on Sha Sha. Living Life and Different but the Same, the two main piano songs, are so similar at points that they could blend into each other. All of the songs are still catchy and none of them completely suck, but I'm disappointed. I would rather hear one really great song than a bunch of ok ones. It seems like he's onto something, but he spread it too thin on this album."
2,LIKEABLE ENOUGH...NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUS EFFORT,"This new Ben Kweller disc....hmmm. I want to like it more than I really do. To be truly honest, the kid is a mediocre singer/guitarist/songwriter, although he can write a likeable enough melody. I wouldn't call his a strong voice. There are no backing vocals, and just ordinary instrumental performances. And he definitely did not go to the Dylan/Lennon/McCartney/Wilson school of lyric writing. The songs are all about ""I wanna"" do this or that, or ""you can"" do this or that. It's really tough to figure out what all the buzz surrounding this kid is all about...a great press agent possibly? Some parental/familial connection to the music industry???"
1,What the (beep) happened to Ben Kweller!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"okay so i am like in love with ben kweller and his albulm SHA SHA. I loved it so much i went out and got the new album ""on my way"". It sucked. It sucked my lawn gnomes butt. Ben kweller sounded so cool in sha sha and like a major lamo in this c.d! What happened? I still love Ben kweller but i mean really, make another c.d as great as Sha Sha and me and my lawn gnome will be happy."
3,solid effort,"i have to just come out and say it, this cd doesnt compare to sha sha. though there are a few good songs such as ""believer,"" and ""My apartment"" overall this album dosnt seem to have the same excitment as sha sha. the songs are just overall more down and depressing and sound rather simaler. i expected more from ben kweller."
5,Ben is no Bummer,"Ben Kweller's new cd On My Way, a follow up to the melodic sound of Sha Sha, is in one word- awesome. This cd is most definitely a keeper and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoyed Sha Sha or just for anyone who enjoys great music in general. Turn it on. Dance around. Sing out loud. That's what it's like!"
1,Eh.,"""Wow, Does anbody else think this guy sounds just like Rivers Cuomo?""He sounds like Rivers SUCKING. I listened to this cd all the way through while typing up a paper, and it did nothing for me. Kweller's first CD is A-OK, but this one feels flat. As it's been said before, watered-down Weezer with none of the ROCK, k."
4,"Good, but Sha Sha is best.","Its a very good CD, but it lacks something Sha Sha had...i think Sha Sha had more memoriable lyrics than this, and a more diverse style of music. Still, On my Way is still a good CD, but I would recommend Sha Sha over this."
4,Rock isn't dead.,"I haven't heard BK's first album, Sha Sha, but I heard most of the songs when he played on Austin City Limits, and I was instantly impressed. I picked this up today, and I'm impressed yet again. The raw sound of this record is quite fitting. It feels like a band is playing, not a bunch of sounds twisted around on the computer.The lyrics aren't so deep, it seems at first listen, but the fresh sound more than makes up for it."
5,Fabulous Tea,I first picked this tea up in Paris at the Bon Marche department store food halls (Le Grand Epicerie de Paris). On returning to the states and trying the tea I was most impressed. Redolent of bergamot and flowers it has an intense aroma and flavor that is well-enhanced with the addition of honey and a little milk. It is now my favorite tea. Enjoy!
5,Delightful,"Why these takes were in a can for 40 years is beyond me. This is another fine example of the soft Baker at his best. The guitar and bass fits his horn to a tee. I am delighted to find this CD. If you like Baker, this is a must buy experience."
5,My sweet ...Embraceable You,"...fingertips lightly gliding up the back of her neck, feeling the warm breath of his sound--embrace me, my sweet embraceable you...and she plays it again and again...nice, nice."
5,rules of the red rubber ball,Beautiful design and an immense source of inspiration. Tom Peters mentioned this little book as one of his favourites and I must say I agree completely. An exceptional designed businessbook.
1,Simply Awful...,"All fluff and no substance. If you read the book, there is one thing I can guarantee. After two days you won't remember one word of it, nor will it make any difference to your business."
4,"Simple book on the meaning of life, or a complex book on how to give your life more meaning?","This book is simple. The guidelines provided within the less-than-100 creatively laid-out pages are simple, but just because something is simple, doesn't make it easy. Author Kevin Carroll outlines seven simple strategies anyone can use to give their life more meaning and more happiness using the iconic red rubber ball most everyone can recall from their school days. It's enjoyable read that can be completed within an hour, but (if you're doing it right) you'll spend a lifetime contemplating the ideas and putting the concepts into action."
5,Perfect gift for grads...or anyone needing inspiration!,"Whenever I need a pick-me-up, I read through this amazing little book...and then I'm ready to take on the world! Kevin Carroll has a great story about growing up and pursuing his life's passion. (He eventually became a trainer for the Philadelphia 76ers and a world-traveling inspirational speaker for Nike.) His insights and encouragements in ""Rules of the Red Rubber Ball"" are helpful for anyone who knows what they love to do but aren't sure how to make a living out of it. My wife and I buy a bunch of copies of this book every year as a gift for graduates, but it also makes a perfect gift for anyone with a dream they want to pursue.This book is short, and it's full of colorful artwork and creative layouts, making it fun to read. The cover of the book actually has a cut-out circle of red rubber ball material. It's great!"
4,Inspirational Book,I heard the author Kevin Carroll speak at a conference I was at in July.He was so inspiring and after his speech stood and signed copies for the students and teachers who heard him for hrs. We ran out of books for him to sign. I purchased this book to give to a family member as a christmas present.
3,Review: Rules of the Red Rubber Ball,"Interesting story in this little book, but I don't think it's lived up to my expectations based on reveiews I read prior to purchasing it."
4,"Lots of fizz, not a lot of flavor","I had heard a podcast that had Kevin Carroll in it and thought I would buy this book. Although the presentation is very creative, the book as a whole didn't do much for me. This guy seems to be a very high energy person and is probably motivated very easily by his own writing style of color and interesting pages, but that's all it seems to be to me is to be a rah-rah book and didn't teach me me a whole lot. It is a quick read and has quite a few power quotes, but it just didn't do it for me."
1,Save your time and money. Not worth the paper it's printed on.,Awful! Very disappointed as the premise and reviews were promising. This book was trite with few insights that aren't obvious.
5,This is amazing!,"I purchased this for my husband after we had the opportunity to hear the author Kevin Carroll at the National Convention for the American Massage Therapy Association. He was incredible and inspiring. This book has so much in such a small volume for everyone at all stages of their lives. This book will help anyone be real, have fun, engage, dare, dream, play, make stuff happen!Rules of the Red Rubber Ball: Find and Sustain Your Life's Work"
2,Dry beats and a minimalist theme.,"Plateau's first full length features very little in the way of innovation or variety. What is does feature is dry, canned, unchanging 4/4 beats. Do not expect much else on this release. Cevin Key and company pretty much keep one idea that can be heard and learned in the first 15 seconds of a track and turn it into a 4-7 minute work. I'm not against repetition, I rather enjoy some Porter Ricks and Speedy J, who are known to release repetition based music. But Music For Grassbars simply comes up short. There are some good ideas on this CD, particularly 'Purple Passion', 'The Kind' and 'Noorderlight', but after those three there's a big dropoff in quality."
2,Can't tell how many cans are in this offer,Please add information about the number of cans that are included in this purchase. Need this information before I can make a purchasing decision. Thanks much
5,the journey that is,"If you've never heard the songs ""Steede Bonnet"" or ""For Carl Sagan"", then you are truly missing out. The album is packed with dramatic, emotional, mind-wandering bliss. If you are of the introspective/reflective/contemplative type, then playing this music amidst a late night drive with only the stars or moonlight to guide you, could seriously help to answer the question, ""Where do we go from here?"""
2,"cute to look at, plays well, but scratches","sounds like a kitty cat but it's true--this portable cd player works fine but it can scratch your cds if you're not careful. It's battery console is opened from the INSIDE of the disc console (where you insert the cd to play). If you don't close the battery lid properly, it is still raised and will scratch the disc once you play it. This player scratched three of my favorites. Sorry to say but whoever thought of putting the battery console inside the disc console is an absolute genius."
1,Just plain awful,"If you care anything at all about sound quality stay far away. I have a very expensive pair of headphones I use with a variety of CD players on various computers, etc. Sound quality has never been an issue with any of them really. Then I got this pile of crap. It sounds HORRIBLE. The two preset eq settings don' help either. I have dozens of Panasonic products including my 1996 model portable CD player (it's huge by today's standards ad takes 6 batteries). I bought this to replace it and the new one made the old one sound incredible. Stay away."
4,amazing value and quality,"i purchased this product for about 60 dollars. its sturdy does what its told and has amazing battery life. here are some pros and cons about this device.pros:color scheme pleases the eyecan use with just one handquick reading, does a 143 file cd in a few secondssturdy(i dropped it once and it acted up for about a half hour and was back to normal)48 hour battery!buttons don't get pressed if its in ur pocket. i love that.cons:there are few but the biggest problem is no artist id3 tag, you basically only get album and track name, this can be rectified by naming the mp3 file after the artist, but really i shouldn't have to it should just do it.the volume control is digital which is a personal problem for me, i like to move the knob.the headphones that came felt awkward but i just used my old earbuds.other than that its amazing, one thing however that you will need if you purchase this is a program like ""tagscanner"" or ""the godfather"" to rename and edit the id3 tags."
2,Problem after about a month of use,It won't play cd-rw discs anymore: it did for about a month. Now it just spins and makes noise. Reads audio and cd-r discs fine. Great anti-skip system. Sound is a tad bit tinny but otherwise okay. I'll probably give it away because I do need the cd-rw capability; don't want to waste cd-rs whenever I want to listen to something. Mine is probably a dud because I haven't found any similar problems on the internet.
3,"no skip, but no radio","The skip protection on this player is the best I ever heard. The sound is good, and it has several basic and extra features. But I'm really disapointed that it didn't have a radio. For $$, they could add a radio. My overall advice would be to look a bit harder, and find another player with a good price and a radio."
3,THis is ok,"This cd-player is ok, it has live, bass and regular sound, but the volume cant go so loud. I would recomend a iriver mp3 player or a sony cd player."
4,A VERY GOOD MP3 PLAYER,"Everything about this mp3 player is perfect. From the Visual perception (Looks great) and unbelieveably light (check out others, you'll see how heavy they are), plays ALL kinds of CD's supporting mp3, wav, and wma. Titles of Albums/Tracks/Time of the song is supported as well. AND THE BATTERY CONSUMPTION IS VERY LOW. I use rechargeable batteries (as you know, they are not ever as strong as alkaline) and i change them every 3 - 4 days. My old CD player needed new batteries every 4-6 hours, very weak.Why did i give it 4 stars? Dropping it once....caused a scratch....dropping it twice caused buttons to fly off....so i warn everyone...please be careful with your mp3 player.An excellent product if it can be taken care of delicately. (I got it returned but immediately bought another one)."
1,Item worked great for a couple months,"Last year I bought this item for my daughter. She listens on her bed in her room and does not carry this item around. We were pleased at first. Within a few months the lid ceased to close properly and she had to listen with the unit flipped upside-down to apply pressure to keep the lid closed. A few months later it became temperamental and skipped and/or refused to play. Bottom line is that in less than a year it became unfunctional in a situation with very little jostling. I would not buy this product again. However, at the same time I bought the PANASONIC RP-HS9 Ear Candy Clip-On Stereo Headphones (Silver), and these are a wonderful and comfortable buy. She loves them."
2,Worthless for Audiobooks,"Although the battery life is truly impressive, DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT FOR LISTENING TO AUDIOBOOKS IN MP3 FORMAT! - you can not fast-forward or reverse (that works only for audio CD's), and the bookmark function remembers only the track number, not the position in the track.For short tracks like music, this may be one of the best units out there. For ~1 hour tracks like most audiobooks, you will be gravely disappointed."
1,"False advertised, potential health hazard","I recieved this item and before I even got it in my mouth the 'doorknocker' came off. Then i wore it, and noticed, my black suppossedly anadozied barbell had all these silver flecks in it. The Paint had been coming off in my mouth and Ive been swallowing it. This product is neither anadized Nor titanium. It was stainless steel with black paint on it. It is falsely advertised, and brings about serious health concerns in regard to potential lead in the paint. Seller has not returned any of my emails in regard to this matter."
2,Take the ticket to Horrorland because it's non refundible!,"The book was okay. R.L. Stine made a really intresting setting in a theme park because non of the authors I read about done that so far. But the rides weren't scary enough, there is too much ""playing"" around in the story where they trick you. I want to be plain serious...Did they get hurt? But this book is good."
4,4 stars,Very good book it was very interesting one of her best books that she has made will tell friends to read it
5,Outstanding book,"This book kept a chill running down my spine the whole time that i was reading it, this was a great book. i usually dont like to read but with this book i could never put it down. thank you RL STINE"
4,One day at HorrorLand,"I think the book Horrorland was a good book, because for one this was a very interesting book and for two it had a lot of action for the ones who like action books. The book Horrorland was about two kids that survive a night at Horror Land. The students really were to attend a Theme park called Wet Willy's, but when the theme park was closed they turned back around to go home and on there way back they saw another theme park that they hadn't saw on there way there. They entered the mysterious park with extreme cautions. The people there seemed very nice. Then the little boy stopped at a ride, he slid down the slide and stayed on forever... I would highly request that you read this book to my peers."
5,Love this toy!,My son is loving his new horse. I got it for him at 12 months but i know he will be using it for a long time. The price on amazon was the best I found.
2,it works ok,"I've had the player for 3 months now. There are a few really annoying things about it. First, in order to stop a movie and come back another time to view it where it was stopped, you have to push a button to have it remember where the movie left off. (The player should do that automatically) Second, the MP3 playback song navigation is really clunky. There are much better players out for less money. Don't waste your $$$ on this one."
2,"Not as good as I expected, but can suffer","Overall, it is a good DVD player, with progressive scan and at this price. But I cannot play SVCD and DVD+R/RW with it, which are some nice features Panasonic should add on. The set up key is hard to use after the first time set-up. And I often press the wrong buttons on the remote control, they are not in a good design.It is good, but not as good as I expected."
2,Pass on this one..,"I bought this DVD player after reading the reviews on here. Unfortunately, the DVD player skips DVDs consistently and I am not impressed by it at all.If I had to do again, I would probably get something else. I paid $112 for a below-average DVD player."
5,"Great player, great price","To ktk3438 who gave this player 1 star, in part because it doesn't have a feature to save the disk position - this player can do that, you need to hit a button on the remote to save the position. This player has a great picture even when only connected to an analog TV with an s-video cable. I haven't got around to getting component cables yet. The optical out provides great sound with both dvds and cds. I haven't tested the jpeg viewing capability yet. For the feature set, picture and sound quality at this price - it's hard to beat.."
1,Incorrect Description,"The description say puncture resistant, they are not, a simple nail will poke straight through, never mine some thing with a real point on it, don't waste your time or money on this rubbish, company will not do anything about the issue either, don't waste you money buying of them either."
2,Meh,It's got this texture that might help avoid a cut but it's basically just rubber. Save your money. You'd be better off getting a metal glove. A little cumbersome but works much better. The fit wasn't very good either. It felt tight on my palm but it was loose in the fingers. Do not recommend.
3,Decent gloves but I prefer leather,"It says they're more cut resistant than leather and maybe they are, I haven't tried to cut them, but they're not as good against punctures for sure. My parakeet bit right through it.Next time I'm buying leather."
4,"so far, so good!","I've only used my gloves twice, so I can't yet attest to their durability, but I am thrilled to declare that I am no longer afraid of my mandoline slicer! :D I can take whatever I'm slicing down to the nub, right against the blade. I've already ALMOST sliced off the tip of my thumb while using my mandoline, so my appendages thank me for this extra insurance in preventing further injuries.The gloves are dipped into their rubbery coating, and the dipper for the pair I have may have been in too much of a rush because they aren't evenly (symmetrically) coated, and one glove could definitely use more coverage.I would say that the product you get for the price is worth it... :)"
3,"Ok, interesting but unbelieveable, especially the UFO stuff","It kept me interested, but the UFO stuff never made any sense and was never explained. I enjoyed the story anyway and wasn't able to guess ""who done it""."
5,A delicate intersection of past sins and present lives.,"Escapism: why the author writes and why the audience reads -- why I praise Star Flight. Once again Whitney engaged me with her lush, detailed setting, and that ever present ability to allow the reader that leap from simply reading to becoming a part. Characterization that is multi-dimensional, and always keeps me guessing until the very end! I close the book and immediately want to journey to that place, to experience the charm and beauty she so richly portrays"
2,frogger,"If you like donkey kong, the one that was played on the first nintendo. This game is much like it and i think you would really like it. However donkey kong still has this game beat. I purchased frogger because i always remembered that it was always checked out when i went to the video store and i figured it must be good, but i am disappointed the graphics they are once again very comparable to nintendo. Sega games should be better than nintendo period, I have many sega games and have never encountered this before. Good thing the game was cheap :)"
2,LEAKS I am returning mine,"I am been pretty disappointed - the ""spout"" is like one of the other reads said really nothing much more than a gimmick - the idea is good, but the quality is poor so this drips even after turning ""off"" the spout.... I have to agree with this comment and since I purchased it to use at my Bar I have to say it does blend wonderful and you could use with out the spout. It makes really good Margarita's and to help pour you have to put it on low blend and pour at the same time this helps push it out. The dispenser TAP is Plastic and does not have enough pressure on it to stop the pour. I have a really cheap blender that does a better job."
5,FOOD SERVICE GRADE BLENDER AT HOME PRICE,"This blender is amazing! I had a KitchenAid blender before which I thought was pretty good! Well was I ever wrong, this blender is powerful enough to:1. Crush Ice with out being helped2. Turn Skim milk into a thick drink, but not a shake3. Make a perfect smoothie every time!Some of the features I really like are:1. The pour spout2. The locking addition lid3. The option to make it a regular blender or a smoothie blender4. The stir stick - never had to use yet though!5. POWER - and this baby is packing it!This is not just an ordinary smoothie blender, this is a does it all blender- I have finally found a blender I am happy with! I only have one complaint - the base of the smoothie pitcher does not come off for cleaning without a screw driver! Other than taht cleanup is easy!"
3,"600 WATTs, NOT 1500W (only pulse)","This is kinda deceptive. It's really rated at 600W. The 1500W only apply to ""pulses."" Therefore, only quick bursts is it's rated at 1500W, while the usual running is still 600W like any other blender. I don't like how the spout stick out, which I KNOW will eventually be knocked off and broken when I try to hand wash it. The blade is noisy, and not smooth, but overall it's okay.However, I don't think it's worth the eighty dollars I just spent!!!!"
1,Junk!,"This thing is a piece of junk! It's the only blender I've ever seen that comes with a ""stir stick"" to unclog the sides of the jar (where the stuff all goes instead of into the blades). This should have been a clue that the thing wasn't very well designed, and it wasn't. It ALWAYS needed to be stirred when making any kind of smoothie, several times, which made the process a real pain. Also, the drain spout is a great place for food to hide and get nasty. Except for the jar it's pretty cheap plastic. But it's in the trash now because the couleing fried itself after two months. Good riddance!"
4,great,i love this blender i have a lot of cuisinart things and i have to say this is great the only thing i did not like was the spout is plastic a little cheep for cuisinart and the jar has to be put on very tight or it will leak. but the work it puts out makes up for the bad.
1,What a waste of money,"From the moment I opened the box, this blender was useless. I used it about 5 times and the motor burned out. Cuisinart replaced the base under warranty. I have probably used it, in it's whole life, about 20 times and now the locking base is cracked... They want over $30 for the $0.75 piece of plastic! It's ludicrous, now this $100 blender is completely useless to me. Plus, when I did use it, it just didn't work well, wouldn't help me make a smoothie in the morning without a fuss every time. Don't waste your money... Buy a Walmart $10 blender, at least it won't matter if it doesn't work after a year!"
1,Flames and smoke,"I use this blender every morning and the last morning it was used it filled my kitchen with smoke and had fire shooting out of it and small pieces of rubber, plastic, and metal were all over my kitchen counter, also cleaning is a huge pain and the seal is always letting the blender leak out liquid from the base. So this is why it gets one star."
1,Garbage,"This thing is horrible.The first time I used it, I had to constantly stir it with the provided stir stick for it to blend properly.The spout didn't work at all, maybe if you blended water, but why would you blend water?When it came to cleaning, it was horrible to clean. You couldn't effectively clean the bottom of it, or the spout.Plus when I was using the pulse setting, there was a rancid smell coming from the motor.The 2nd time I used it, I used it for about 5 seconds then a bunch of smoke came out of it. I quickly turned it off, and there was a bunch of burnt plastic. The machine didn't work anymore after that.I bought it locally, so I returned it and got a refund. The customer service person said I was atleast the 4th person that brought it back because of something wrong with it (this is a very small town with maybe 5000 people)They then pulled all of it off their shelf and ceased to sell it."
3,"Broke in 6 months, but still mostly like it.","I'm kind of torn on whether to give this a thumbs up or not. On the plus side, it is very powerful and appeared to be well constructed and designed. The unit doesn't even slow down when blending ice. I like the silicone O-ring between the jar and base. The tap is very handy. On the minus side: the tap can trap (unblended) stuff (requiring a bleed and 2nd blend); it kind of bugs me that there isn't any good way to thoroughly clean the inside of the tap; and I now have a slow leak dribbling down the drive shaft of the blade. I haven't decided whether to replace the base of the jar (fortunately it is available directly from Cuisinart). I'm kind of disappointed because I'm blending the identical drink that my previous cheapo blender had no problems with for 6 years."
3,Some Chrome and some assembly required,"This product does what it is supposed to do, however, an assembly problem has caused some of these (two sent to me) to be sent without the motor screwed down to the base. The screws were bouncing around the inside of the base and the motor clunked back and forth when you tilted the base. When the second unit arrived like the first - I opened it up, found the problem and screwed in the four screws so works like a charm now. The only chrome is the control faceplate, the rest is gray plastic but it still works well making smoothies. Last comment - Amazon was fantastic dealing with the return."
1,Powerful but very difficult to clean,"As the title says, I was pleased with the powerfulness of this blender, but the special cavitator part in the bottom is next to impossible to clean. It takes about 10 gallons of water to flush out most of the stuff, and you might still have a few chunks left in there. Who knows though because you can't see in."
3,Smoothie Machine from Cuisinart,"The Smooth Operator is a good choice for making smoothies. It has one quirk, however. When it has to work hard it tends to smell, like it's overheating. Also, when it clogs down under stress it is hard to un-clog. You have to stir the ingredients to get the blades to catch the upper ingredients and blend them. Even when you stir the ingredients, it still has trouble blending them. The machine seems to be powerful enough. It crushes ice with ease."
4,VERY INFORMATIVE,I USED THIS BOOK FOR AN ONLINE COURSE AND I FOUND IT VEY INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE.I LIKED THE WAY IT HAS THE CHAPTER REVIEWS AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER SO YOU CAN LOOK BACK ON WHAT YOU READ AND PULL OUT THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS.
4,purchase of used development across the lifespan bood,"The book was in the condition described for a used book, arrived punctually, and is exactly what I needed. Thank you!"
1,Wrong edition,"I was not pleased with the item received - it was supposed to be the 4th Edition, however I received the 3rd Edition. I did buy a new one and received credit for this, however it took longer than expected to finally get the correct book/edition."
5,Fabulous fun,"Danger, romance, and sex are intertwined in Lori Wilde's new romantic tale of opposites attracting. In one corner: Cassie Cooper, a cute PR whiz with an active love life but spooked by the notion of ""one man for the rest of her life."" In the opposite corner: Dr. Harrison Standish, an Egyptologist with a nerdy, color-blind professor's wardrobe; he learned early on that love was for suckers. Naturally, these two are destined to clash early at a museum's masquerade ball organized by Cassie's firm. When the main attraction of the evening -- a legendary amulet -- is stolen, the two are forced to team up to find the jewel and defeat the bad guys. In between (you guessed it!), they fall head-over-heels. Like Janet Evanovich, Wilde knows how to give fast-talking, spunky heroines the sweet romance they deserve, but Wilde's love scenes are, well, a lot wilder."
3,Disappointing & Silly,"While I really liked & enjoyed the two main characters, Cassie & Harrison, the storyline itself was just a little too out there for me. And the climax of the story was just absurd, lightening bolts coming out the sky etc...I gave it 3 stars because I did like the characters and their interactions were very humorous. The story just wasn't my cup of tea"
4,Fast paced romantic adventure,The costume party that public relations specialist Cassie Cooper planned at the museum goes very wrong when a priceless amulet is stolen. To find the artifact she turns to Archaeologist Harrison Standish for assistance. A reluctant romance develops between the two as this fast paced romantic adventure twists and turns it's way to a glowing conclusion.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry author of the Set Me Free Series -Possibilities and Resolutions.

3,good enough,the whole way through the movie the main lady says that she committed murder when she did did not. all started when she found a gun by the lake.
3,Caution - this is not a complete intercom system,"This is an add-on unit that is only compatable with WHI-5C, which apparently Westinghouse is discontinuing (although they did have some remaining when I called). The unit works on radio waves, so I am told it will not have the house-wiring issues some units have.My issue with this is that the description is not clear that this is only an add-on unit - you have to buy additional units for any other locations you want to talk to. When it arrived I opened the box and found only the control unit pictured, with no other intercoms for it to speak with, so I had to call Westinghouse, which is when I was informed that it was being discontinued, and was not compatible with the other expansion units you will find on their website (the 2, 3, or 4 channel wireless)."
5,Love the style,We got most of our flatware for our wedding but I continue to order more to add to our collection. It's a great classic style. I've had most of my set for 8 years and they look as if I just got them yesterday.
5,Lena puts todays artists half her age to shame,If you listen to recordingsof Lena Horne 50 years ago her voice still sounds the same. Not only has her voice not changed it got better.
2,Tennis IQ is Elementary,"Tennis IQ is nicely written and organized. But unfortunately for me, it was also extremely basic. So, if you want to test yourself on the basic foundations of tennis strokes and tactics, it's a good fit. But if the 'IQ' in the title makes you think this is an advanced and cerebral book, be much more careful- you're liable to be disappointed as I was."
5,Hard to find,"I used to buy this stuff all the time back in the days before Splenda achieved world domination over all sugar substitutes and their minions, now the company has put it into very limited distribution. Even though it has a slightly more chemical taste than Splenda because it's made with a saccharin component, it cooks well, adds a little more caramel flavor than Splenda, and I was very happy to find it again...especially at the price I paid here on Amazon! You really can buy anything here."
1,Vile Tasting Sweetner,"As a diabetic, I am always looking for ways to drop the carbs. I've been trying to come up with a low-carb BBQ sauce. I bought a case of this stuff at Amazon figuring ""how bad can it be?"" I was wrong! This stuff is DISGUSTING!!!You always hear about a product having a bad after taste, but this stuff gives you the vile taste first. I've tried mixing it with honey, milk, butter and even lemon juice trying to kill the bad taste. It doesn't work!DO NOT BUY THIS DISGUSTING PRODUCT!!!"
1,Tastes disgusting!,"I bought a case of the Sugar Twin Brown Sugar substitute based on the positive reviews it received. Was I disappointed! This product tastes NOTHING like sugar. It tastes like what it is: saccharin. I now have a case of the worst-tasting product on earth, and I can't return it due to Amazon's return policy. Caveat Emptor. Take my advice and stick with sucralose, stevia, and/or erythritol. Blech."
3,Great service,"This item came within a very reasonable amount of time. I'd been looking for this in my local grocery stores but they no longer carry this item. As a pre diabetic, I use this on almost everything & in baking as well. Great item & goes a long way."
5,This started it all for me,"This CD back in the day started it all for me. This work of art is amazing. Super fast beats that make you want to dance and move around.I am so glad i am able to find this cd. This was made waay before its time. All you ravers out will love this. Think a mix of hi-NRG music and happy hardcore, scooter ETC. Ishkur will even love it!"
4,So fun and easy to learn,My 7 year old son had so much fun learning Italian. The videos were colorful and easy to understand. I had fun watching him learn too!
4,Daughter Loved It!!!,When this movie came in our Influenster VoxBox for Mommas we were not to sure at 1st what i'd be like.. I wasn't at this time familiar with what the video was all about.. But I am now and my 3 year old daughter loves it.. We are looking to pick out a new one to buy right now! I defiantly recommend buying this for any child who has a interest in learning more..
3,Introdutory to language,This is a great way to introduce your child to a new language. It is fun and invntive to learn the initial conversational piece of the language. I like it and my youngest finds it fun in which he relates the dinosaur to Dino Dan. I have no idea why but he does.
4,"Very informative, but so expensive!","I've always been eager to learn new languages! This just seemed like a fun way to kick off the learning process. Fun for mommies, daddies and children alike, this instructional set is easy to comprehend."
5,Killer little doodad,"We've stepped on it, spilled tea on it, and neglected it in general and this cheap little gadget does what it's supposed to. Uses squat for power and never fails. And to think people are out there selling fancy expensive readers, and other people are actually buying them. Good grief."
2,Good while lasted,"Product worked for about 3 month, then CF portion stopped working. Quick inspection revealed that CF connector was not soldered to PCB. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Horrible quality,"Buyer beware. Very cheaply made, and does not work properly. USB cable does not fit well in slot and must be constantly jiggled or held in. The pins in the slot for the CF/MicroDrive are placed too high, making it impossible to use that drive. xD card does not fit either.This thing is cheap for a reason. It is very poorly made and I would not buy it."
1,Who does she think she's fooling?,"Here is the queen of trash music and tramp behaviour. Sex, sex, sex for decades and now she wants to play moral with the kids? Don't let your kids take a lesson from the queen of sleeze."
3,"Mixed feeling about this one but overall, it was good.","First, let me just say that I like Madonna who is incredibly talented as an entertainer and I will always sing and dance to her music. With that said, I had some mixed views on this children's book.I really like the messages in the book on jealousy and cliques. There are a lot of social issues about this and Madonna made these points clear. I like that there is a positive turning point to this story and good parenting plays the part.As far as the writing...you can totally hear Madonna's voice. I really think she tried way to hard to sound British here. It wasn't the best writing. She could have softened the tone a bit because at certain points of the story, the narrator sounded snappy.The illustrations were done nicely but I can't help but see The English Roses as The Spice Girls. I found them too commercialized."
5,Enjoyed this book with my 7 year old daughter,I was happy to find this book at Amazon.com. My daughter and I really enjoyed it. My daughter loves to read about older girls and it is a very enjoyable read.
5,The Beautiful English Roses,"This a classic story of friendship that was cleverly written by Madonna.I think this is a must-read for children of all ages!!!!!!The story is ultimately about judgment. And how often times we do judge others without really knowing anything about them. I think that is a great message to teach our youth. Perhaps, we adults need to be reminded as well.Most of the reviews for this book are positive contrary to what you may read on here.I purchased the book even though I was skeptical. I could help but think, ""What does Madonna know about writing children's books?"" I was pleasantly surprised.This truly is a charming story with wonderful illustrations.Furthermore, Madonna does not profit from sales of this book. All profit goes to a children's charity."
5,The English Roses,I thought this was a very good book. My children enjoyed it very much. I bought three copies to give to my friends that have children as well. This book is worth the money!
4,A modern fable,This book is a great read for first and second-graders. While it is of no literary value it is a good moralist fable without being archaic.
5,People can change and mature - this is proof,"...I bought it the first day it was released and read without prejudice as to who the author was, eventhough I'm a big Madonna fan. It's a children's book. I think this book was very well done, not to mention this was her first publication of this type. The values and lessons are simple to understand and that's what makes it great for children...they can relate to the situations posed and learn. You can understand how Madonna's priorities have changed with her maturity, and that's refreshing.I hope that Madonna will never lose sight on her past, because that made her and shaped her into what she is today. We should all remember our pasts and use them to better ourselves.Nice job Maddy, I can't wait for book two!!"
4,A reminder to Christians,"Although I am not a Madonna fan or a Christian, the American ""Christians"" who are dissing this book due to a brief stage act should stop and think. The message in the book is to do onto others as you would have them do onto you, which is a main tenet of Christianity when the politics is removed from it. The other point of it is that how you appear is rarely who you really are. The world would be a more peaceful place if people could get this through their skulls. Most of the hate is due to the conservative idea in a material world that your actions equal your true self, which is simply false, especially an act on a stage. I doubt that if a male singer like Mick Jagger wrote a kid's book after sleeping with 4000 teens girls anyone would be hollaring about his inability to send messages to children ""Instead of being born again, why not just grow up already"""
1,Very disappointing -- awful plot,"Madonna, please do not write a book again, especially for children. The girls depicted in this book have beautiful faces (no room for less than beautiful faces?) and are skinny, anorectical: this is a bad example for children. The plot is not original in any way either; only the drawings are really well-made and deserve a look.In my humble opinion, I think you should try OTHER children's books, NOT THIS ONE. This book will sell some units just because of media's attention; Madonna's (huge) popularity; and marketing/advertising."
2,Give me a break...,"Seriously, who can relate to this book? And how many children really feel excluded because they're beautiful? This may happen on rare occasions, but this book has a truly ridiculous premise. Some of the writing is creative, and I love the illustrations. But I think that the ""moral"" of the book is a bit idiotic. Most children suffer because they're different in some way that is generally less acceptable to society than beauty is. Look at the magazine rack in the bookstore, and all you will see are beautiful faces--faces that young girls hope to aspire to. Let's see a book about inner beauty, Madonna."
4,Refreshing Style And Great Content,"I liked this book more that I thought I would. This is clearly a book written for girls. Anyone with daughters ( I have two ) will appreciate how the story protrays how girls can be arbitrarily cruel and cliquey. The twist in this story makes the lesson of inclusion heartfelt without being preachy. The book is beautifully illustrated. I will definitely purchase her next book based on the content of this one. I buy alot of childrens books, and I found this one refreshing in style. My nine and five year old girls love it too !!"
1,The English Roses,"I mistakenly trusted Madonna and bought this book after only flipping through. As a mother of two daughters, I have now hid the book so it is not chosen for our reading time. I find it full of all the wrong messages..beauty as the focus attribute, jealously and envy as part of a child's everyday existence, social clique acceptance. These combined with the condescending technique of scolding the reader and assuming the reader's thoughts and comprehension make the book an insensitive, insulting and shockingly irresponsible effort from a person I previously and consistently admired as an artist and mother."
1,Wilted Roses,"If you are even considering buying this bit of tripe from Madonna, my best advice to you is don't. There is absolutely nothing about it to recommend. The text is way too long, poorly written, and not at all interesting. Even the pictures are not enough to keep a young child interested long enough to sit through it. The ""moral"" isn't even thinly veiled, but is like sitting through a bad sermon. The only reason I can think of that this book was ever published is because of its author. I would give it no stars if the form would let me, and two thumbs down."
2,Pretty unrealistic,"I've been a big fan of Madonna's for six years. I love her music and her songs. But this story is so simple and I feel that Madonna did not put a lot of thought into it. So four British girls feel envy for a lovely young girl named Binah. And a fat fairy godmother comes to them in a dream and changes their attitudes. Give me a break! Changes in a person do not occur simply from dreams! It takes the four girls getting over themselves and choosing to meet Binah or Binah wanting to be friendly with them that brings the change. And what's with the rudeness written ""If you say no, you are telling a big fat fib, and I'm going to tell your mother. Now stop interupting me."" And the line ""You believe me, don't you? You'd better, because I'm telling you."" BACK OFF, MADONNA! We are not obligated to believe a thing, simply because you're a controversial figure! You either write in a respectful or in a acceptably critical manner or you can keep those rude remarks to yourself!"
2,Madonna is better at singing,"Nice theme, bad story. Madonna is better at singing than she is at writing. The narrator of the story couldn't possibly be more patronizing -and he (she) even tries to be funny! Leave it to the characters to be the funny ones. As for the illustrations, eventhough the illustrator has tried to portray every race possible, he forgot a simple detail: not all girls are beautiful and skinny. Again, the picture of perfection is rubbed on our daughters noses, like they don't go through a hard enough time in the middle school years to accept themselves and fit in.(...)"
4,nice,This is a really nice book.I think Kids will like it. It might make a difference in some Kid's thinking about other people. Madonna you did a good job!!!...~~~ToNy~~~ : )
1,A thorn?,"BUYER BEWARE...I don't pay attention to Author name when purchasing a book for my daughter..who loves to read...It looked so colorful and pretty that I thought I would puchase it. I should have read it first...After 20 minutes she brought it to me and told me, ""I'm not into fantasy, Mom"". Girls who don't ""belong"" with the ""in"" girls are not thorns!"
4,A great book for children young and old,"did anyone who posted a negative review on this site even read the book? it seems like they are attacking Madonna personally - not the point of a review folks - back to 'The English Roses'This is a great book for young children in todays age. it talks about loneliness, friendship and jealousy in a way that would get through to children. i am of course speaking of the way children today seem to judge people based on looks or what everyone else thinks. When i first heard that M was going to write this series of books i was skeptical at first but after the read i realize that she pulled it off swimmingly."
1,Terrible,"This is without a doubt the worst children's book I have ever read. Being a long-time Madonna fan doesn't blind me to the fact that she is a bad writer. She commits the most elementary writing mistake: she tells people what she's going to tell them, rather than just telling them the story. She is preachy and caustic, and not respectful towards her audience. Save your money."
2,A tale told 1001 times before,"Other than some colorful graphics there isn't much to be had in this insipid tale of poor Binah, who finds herself odd girl out of the English Roses. It seems to be written more with teenagers in mind, but the level of writing is that of 4-8 year olds. I have a copy that was translated into Lithuanian, which pains me to read each time my little girl asks for it. Not so much that my Lithuanian is that bad, but the story itself is so boring and comes to such a trite ending with nothing much along the way to capture my girl's attention. Yet, she likes the pictures. I think Madonna better stick to making music and song and dance videos, because she is clearly out of her realm when it comes to children's stories."
4,My Daughter Loved It (and so did I),"Sure there's been a lot of hype about The English Roses, but would you expect any less? I have been anxiously awaiting it's arrival.. and the rest of the series as well.My daughter (who is five) and I have read it six times already, and we just got it today. I even cried the first time I read it, when the girls are getting a glimpse into the life of Binah.. and they realize just how good they've really got it.The story is clever, good and kept my daughter's attention again and again.. plus the illustrations are absolutely beautiful. Great job Madonna!"
3,The English Roses,"I read this book with the necessary scepticism of a hard working freelance children's author. I have to say, that I found the story itself to be well written. (No grammar goof-ups) But, I felt cheated. Who exactly is the protagonist here? Is it Bina, or the other 4 girls? Although the girls learn a lesson, they did not figure it out on their own as every good protagonist should. No siree, they had a fairy godmother(how original) show them the light. This concept would have been great in the 70's(although a little over-done)but todays children want the independence and growth from solving problems on their own. One of the biggest no-no's that I hear from editors today is not to cheat the reader out of the story by having the problem solved by an outside force. (a parent, a teacher, or a fairy godmother!) Why don't these same rules of writing apply to Madonna? I think I'll submit my next picture book to her editor."
1,The English Roses,Fairly lame and unimaginative - doubt it would have ever been published had it not been written by a celebrity. There are wonderful children's books out there for this age group - I don't think I'd waste my money on this sort of thing.
2,"Jealous girls are ""Roses"" ???","I have no argument with Madonna writing a book. But I do takeissue with even writing a book for vulnerable young girls that use the name ""Roses"" when talking of a group of girls that are the ""in"" crowd and that leave another girl out who is, what,a thorn? Come on. The editor at this publishing house onlysaw the name Madonna, and didn't care what message it gave.Our society is so enamored with celebrity, and any motheror father, teacher or librarian who buys this book is passingon that unfortunate tradition."
1,The English Roses,"I am so sorry to hear that Ms. Madonna wrote this book, because she thought there was a lack of good children's books. I work in a library and I can guarantee her that there are wonderful books out there that teach great moral lessons. If Ms. Madonna didn't find them, that either shows 1) she has very poor research skills 2) she was dumb enough not to check with a children's librarian.The illustrations are great the book is mediocre."
2,"Oh, please","I guess we should be proud that our little, Detroit girl has made it big in the business of writing children's fiction. Too bad for Madonna that the best thing about the book are the illustrations (which she had nothing to do with). The book is contrived and awkward (maybe that's a British thing).Madonna said in an interview that her daughter helped her edit the book. It needed to be edited some more. Throughout the book, Madonna has this annoying habit of addressing the reader with little asides that just seem out of place.The characters are unsympathetic, even the ones that are supposed to be sympathetic.And the fairy godmother angle is just trite.2 stars for the illustrations. No stars for the book."
3,What about the illustrator?,"This is the first children's book I've seen that doesn't give front cover credit to the illustrator. Pictures are just as important as words for making a successful children's book. Other famous-name authors such as Toni Morrison and Jamie Lee Curtis share credit on the cover; why not Madonna? PS Jeffrey Fulvimari, five stars for the artwork!"
1,Gender Role Heavy,"Not all girls dress in designer clothes, play with other girls, and envy the blonde. This book may hit home for some girls, but it has definitely placed the idea of ""what a little girl is made of"" in a teeny tiny box, wrapped it with a sickenly pink (AND PUSHY) bow, and alienated any mom, daughter, sister, grandma, and neice who would rather play with frogs and bugs, wear baggy jeans, and avoid clicky girly behavior.It's belittling to the intellect of young girls.There's already enough trite, superficial, girl fodder in the world. (Icing on cake, illustrations done by a fashion person)Maybe we should expect more for ourselves and our future generations and stop fostering these gender norms, especially with something this potentially visually damaging. Pick more suitable illustrations and maybe you'd have something to work with. Considering who the author is, that'll never happen."
3,A cynical edge,"I found this book a little creepy, despite its pretty pictures and happy ending. It's about a girl who is rejected by others because she looks too perfect, until it is revealed that she is actually poor, that her mother is dead, that her life is unexpectedly horrible. Once they see this, the other girls abandon their jealousy and accept her as ""one of them"".The story touches on important issues, like acceptance, jealousy, sympathy. But it does so with a cynical edge. What if the new girl had been happy and content after all? Would she have remained an outcast? Madonna's story implies so. The ending seems to be a happy one, but also leaves me with a bizarre feeling of ""hoping"" that every silver lining has a deep dark cloud underneath ... hoping that people have some secret flaw that will make us like them better. Is that what we want to teach our kids?"
1,It's what we should expect,"The artists' colors are very nice. I do have a problem with all the girls having skinny, skinny bodies. Not a good signal for teen and preteen girls. The messages Madonna sends are that you shouldn't judge someone until you know them (OKAY), all people are thin (NOT OKAY), and last but not least, if you invite a beautiful person into your group, you will be beautiful by association (NOT OKAY). The lonely girl might better have been physically bland or marred in some way but still thought beautiful by everyone who knew her. That would have been a lesson worth learning. ..."
5,"Very pretty book with interesting, quirky story.","I'm not sure if this book ever would've been published if Madonna wasn't Madonna, first of all. But, that being said, ""The English Roses,"" about a clique of fun, young girls who resent someone new and pretty in their class rather than getting to know her, is a pretty charming, well-told story. And the illustrations are absolutely beautiful.The best, most original part of the narrative were the interjections made by the storyteller to her audience. Occasionally interrupting the flow of the story (but not to the book's detriment), Madonna will write to her readers, ""Don't interrupt. I'm trying to tell you, silly,"" and other interjections like that.All in all, I'd let my eight-year-old cousin read it. And I didn't mind flipping through the pages myself."
4,Beauty CAN be a burdon.,"As Madonna proves in this story of a beautiful, yet lonely girl who is an outcast among her friends. This book shows the diversity of families, and has a great message. Though it may seem a little shallow at first, I am sure there are many children who can relate to either side of the story. If you are an outcast, or have a hard time accepting people who you believe are ""above ""you, this book shows that things are not always as pretty as they seem on the outside. Its about getting to know people before passing judgement, and walking in someone elses shoes. Its a fun book for an 8 year old girl, or a 23 year old boy. Not to mention that its really well made, and the illustrations are colorful,and creative. Buy this and read it to a child in your life, or keep it on your coffee table like I do."
4,A Delightful Story!,"As soon as my three daughters (ages, 11, 9, and 6) and I sat down to read this, they were captured from the start. The illustrations are so bright and fun and the age-old story that you can't tell a book from its cover, still holds true. ... my girls loved the story."
3,not bad at all,"Since this book is by Madonna and since the idea of her writing a child's book seems so odd this book will somewhat controversial. I'll put that to the side for a minute. The story is actually well done. It tells kids in a clever way about being fair, the wrongness of envy and the truth that things aren't always what they appear to be. The art work is decent and it's rather nicely written.Now back to Madonna. If you find her revolting or if you think this is nothing more than a publicity stunt then obviously this book isn't for you. If you're neutral you may want to wait until it shows up in your public library. Most little kids don't or shouldn't even know who Madonna is so this is probably a best bet for her fans."
2,The English Roses by Madonna,DisappointedI read this book both as a mother as a writer; a writer who took 4 years to get her first book published. I think the illustrations are good. The concept for the story is decent. I found the story needed better construction. It begins well but you lose interest very quickly. Writing for children is the one of the most important and challenging things anyone can do. Maybe it won't matter in Madonna's case because of her celebrity.
1,Not a very good book,This book has fallen victim to its hype. Unfortunately what it promises and what it delivers are very different.
5,Great book!,My daughter McKena loves this book.. She sees this happening in her school. She was once like Binah.. No longer..
1,Oh gee,"... the latest fad--childrens book with paper thin morals, pretty pictures and a flat story I could have written when I was ten. Skip this hypocritical effort."
5,The perfect lesson,"My daughter is finally at the age where jealousy is a factor. I have been wondering how I was to explain this emotion to my 9 year old. We unwraped this book on Christmas morning, read it as a bedtime story that night, and then experienced one of those Ah-ha moments together. Thank you, Madonna, for making this delicate topic easier for Mothers around the world to express."
1,Terrible story!,"This story is one cliche after another. Poorly written. I really wanted to like this book, and I really just don't. It belittles the reader."
5,Beautiful and Thoughtful,"The was a wonderful book and Madonna did a great job.I am so sick of all of these so called ""reviewer's"" who are giving the book a low rating because they dislike the author. These people have not even read the book. Do us all a favor and stay off the boards unless you have an intellectually honest review of the book."
5,Inspiring to the eyes and ears!,I am a Kindergarten teacher and happened by this book in the store...The cover alone with such amazing artwork drew me in to look within the binding. The story is simply written and again the artwork is awesome. My 'kids' love it!
1,Mockery of children's lit,"Madonna's first attempt at a children's book is a horrible attempt. She tries much too hard on this whole British thing, channeling Mary Poppins, and is much too obvious with the lessons to be learned by the little girls. The idea that the beautiful little girl has to slave away while the snotty little girls are mean is just a little too ""Little Princess"" (which is a much, MUCH better book) and very anachronistic. Madonna is trying very hard to build a new classic but fails. There are great children's books out there, many with good messages, but this is not one of them."
4,A Perfect Book For Little Girls!,"I was very uncertain what to expect of this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. My 8 yr. old daughter absolutely loved it. The concept of envy and jealousy can be hard to explain to children but it is an emotion that many naturally feel towards their peers and don't understand. I thought the way in which Madonna told the story was funny, touching, and easy for kids (especially girls) to relate to. The illustrations are captivating as well. I recommend this book!"
5,Truly inspiring!,"Who would have ever thought that Madonna would write a children's book? I certainly never would have imagined it. Yet, here it is. The book is truly inspiring. Madonna has written a tale of jealousy, and how, if you don't know a person, you are judging the outside, but not taking into account what is on the inside. It is a story all children should hear. The English Roses is wonderfully written, and gorgeous in it's illustrations. Pick the book up for the story. Don't judge the book based upon your assumptions of Madonna. Plus, all proceeds for the book go to children's charity, which is a wonderful thing! Despite what a person who posted their review, without having even read the book, said, Madonna isn't doing this to cash in on motherhood. She's doing it to help children, in several ways. The book is great, and I recommend it for children of all ages!"
2,I would not recommend this book,"The basic idea for the story was good, just poorly told. What really bothered me was the line in the book ""If you say no, you are telling a big, fat fib, and I am going to tell your mother."" Binah (the object of envy)does not have a mother and how are children whose mothers have passed away supposed to feel? It's also hard ro believe that wonderful Binah had no friends whatsoever."
5,Dont judge the book until you read it!!!!!!!!,"People that have rated this book low have not read the book. Madonna is not making money off this book as all of the proceeds for this book are going to the sprituality for children foundation. She was on Oprah this week and explained her thoughts on the book and what has caused her to take on this new venture.While she is not an innocent person, she is a very intelligent person and just for being creative and is not afraid to push the limits on that creativity. If the people that made these comments had the opportunity to make the money that Madonna has by doing what she has done had the opportunity I'm sure that they would have done it also.I think this was a very good book with some children's issues that do happen in life.Please take a chance on the book!"
3,Just doesn't grab me :-(,"I am sorry to say that this story just doesn't do anything for me.The illustrations are great and I believe make this book because there is very little content in the story.Meant to be a modern fable, it just falls flat. I believe that Madonna tried to write it in a chatty, friendly style with a touch of humour but it just doesn't work. The idea is great, but the finished product comes across as awkward and patronizing.I do look forward to reading further offerings from Madonna as her style may impove in time."
2,Better Illustrated than Written,"The illustrations caught my eye and made me pick it up, the writing and trite and cliched story made me put it back on the shelf. Madonna is a lot of things but a good writer is not one of them, at least I didn't see it in this book. I will, however, be on the lookout for more books illustrated by Jeffrey Fulvimari. He deserves more credit than the author, and yet his name doesn't appear on the cover, as I believe is traditional with children's books. If you want a story with a moral and not inspired by ""don't hate me because I'm beautiful"" shampoo commercials, I recommend Shel Silverstein's ""The Giving Tree"" which will remain a classic long after Madonna's book is a footnote in ""Where Are They Now?"""
2,"White, Prissy and Preachy","I prefer the REAL Madonna; the one she sold to us for so many years donning another disguise. She has become one trendy dogmatic woman. Geez, reading this book leaves me wondering why she is taking the fame away from other children's book writers? People mindlessly go buy her book because of who she is, not due to the substance. The English Roses is very white/prissy and preachy. Give your hard earned cash to marginal, unknown brilliant children's book writers that will never have a chance next to Madonna. Give your kids the gift of learning what true literature really is. Spend your money on books that will teach languages and cultures that have not been explored in the United States. Search the web for plot-driven children's books with substance, such as COOL SALSA, DRUM, CHAVI, DRUM! TORTILLAS AND LULLABYES, etc. Give these magnificent writers a chance against Madonna,the woman who already has all the fame and glory she needs!"
2,About the racism in this book,"I read an essay by RAH about this book. John W. Campbell jr, started the original draft of this story, but never finished it. Campbell gave it to RAH to finish. RAH said Campbell's original was extremly racisist and distasteful and he did his best to get rid of the racism. If I understand correctly what I have read about Campbell (written by Asimov, and Heinlein) he was even a Nazi sympathizer early in the war."
2,Old Heinlein,"Book was recommended to me because it had some very interesting parallels to the Iraq War. It's old Heinlein and even old sci-fi so the writing style drips of this. A very ""ok"" book with only a couple scenes that I thought were extremely well written. But liked some of the attitude of the characters as they were very realistic to being in a war. But overall a book you can definitely skip."
2,Yellow Peril garbage,"I love Heinlein's work. Really. But this piece is an embarrassment to the bulk of his work. Not only is it yellow-peril racism, but it's just silly overall and advances none of Heinlein's philosophical beliefs. Since it is from 1941, perhaps this can be understood since Heinlein was a Navy man and the Navy was clearer on the Japanese threat than most. You have go to the the 1962 book ""Farnham's Freehold"" to find a worse Heinlein novel.Two stars only because Heinlein wrote it. No need for anyone, even a fan, to actually read it."
2,INSANELY RACIST,"This book has a good plot and decent characters, but it's racist! It was written during WWII, so the Japanese were not thought well of in the U.S., and that feeling is reflected throghout the story. Although Heinlein makes attempts at softening the blow (one of the characters is a well liked American who looks Pan-Asian)I was shocked after reading Heinlein's later books which preached tolerance. I wouldn't read this one, try Stranger in a Strange Land, The Door into Summer, or Double Star instead."
2,Made Me Squirm in My Seat...,"This was my first Heinlein novel, and I have since been warned that it was a poor introduction, so I'm giving that warning to you all as well. This was one of his earliest, and definitely not his best. Don't let that turn you off to a fine writer.All that said, a lot of things in this book made me squirm. It was published in 1949, shortly after World War II, so some of the racist elements are as understandable as they can be to someone in the new millennium. However, I still squirmed quite a bit over the secret weapon that spares only whites and such. Some anachronisms in early sci fi are quaint. That one certainly isn't...."
1,Un-Heinlein,"If you were to speculate that someone foisted a job on Heinlein, or possibly black-mailed him to write the story for a ""ghost author,"" then Sixth Column would be my candidate, and in fact, that is case. The story line was from John W. Campbell, Jr. Somehow, he succeeded in persuading Heinlein to try and dress it up, but - sow's ear - silk purse ... Heinlein writes that he tried to clean it up and remove the racism, but given the surviving story there can't have been much other than racism in Campbell's original draft. RAH concluded that he did not consider the result a success.If you read this story, then you should certainly also read ""If This Goes On --"", which is Heinlein's own version of such a story. Published in 1940, ITGO focuses on home-grown ""invaders,"" when an extreme sect of Christianity seizes power in the US. Heinlein's brutal enemy is ourselves."
1,Foaming-at-the-mouth racism!,"Heinlein was supposed to be one of the great SF authors of all time, but this book certainly isn't an indication of it!The only thing that ""elevates"" this story above mindless and juvenile kill everything war adventure is the violent racism in it. If you're willing to forgive RAH his racism (having written the book ca. WWII), then there's nothing.So depending on your forgiveness level, it's either racist trash or just plain trash, and definitely not worth reading in either case."
5,One of the best,"Although this book probably would be targeted by the ""Wussified Politically Correct"" crowd of critters, this is probably one of the best from Heinlein. Right up there with Methusela's Children. It should be a 'Must Read' by any SciFi fan."
4,"It is a good example from the time it was written, but might be tough for contemporary readers","This is an enjoyable book and is typically Heinlein in many of its respects. It has characters you can root for and it hopes for liberty to triumph because people are willing to struggle and fight to make it happen, even against incredible odds. It is also the product of its time, which was very different from today. The racist presentation of Asians in the book will put off many readers. At the time it was pretty standard stuff given the propaganda of WWII and the Korean War, but today it comes off as offensive. If you accept that things were different and can set that aside, it is a fun and readable book."
4,"Not your normal Heinlein, but well worth the read....","This is not your typical RAH book. It does not fit into the Long Family script. But it is a wonderful, although short, read. From the start of the book onwards, you are pulled into the occupation of the US. I've seen several movies done primarily in the 70s/80s that tried this scenario and flopped. This succeeds through the typical RAH flair for the unusual. Don't miss this book."
4,Excellent for its time.,"I first read this book back in the sixties, and it is representative of the ""WWIII/Invasion"" genre of stories that were quite common at the time in print and on the screen. This is a good one, because despite the racial overtones (perhaps a tad less acceptable now), it is close to believable. I like that in a SciFi book. All too often, the author will make some stupid mistake or leap of faith that renders the rest of the story completely unreadable for me. Heinlein almost never did that. He either had his facts straight, or went somewhere where there weren't so many facts to trip him up.This is vastly different from the ""stranger in a strange land"" style, but it is definitely Heinlein all the way. And I personally found it difficult to put down. I recommend it as an excellent representative of a specific mid-century style, as a representative of Heinlein's early writings, and as a good though dated read."
4,What do you do when you have lost the war?,"In this novel ( also published as ""the day after tomorrow"") the heros are scientists who are in a secret bass in a mountain in Colorado.The novel has been called racist because the Japanese likefuture invaders are oriental ( and called flat faces and other things)in the book. The idea of using a religion as the base for a subversion of a society is an Heinlein theme in several classic sci fi novels.Like a Campbell novel the heroes use super-science weapons to complete the plot. The name 6th column comes from Heinlein's theories of an underground organization ( 5th column in other context).The problem of what you do when a people are being oppressed by a dominant minority who controls government law, police and armed forces isn't new.One answer in modern times has been terrorism."
1,Racist and simplistic,"This is not one of Heinlein's better efforts.First, there is the racism. It is extremely anti-Asian. Now, I'm not a PC police type who shuts down every racist note from more ignorant times, but there should be a limit, this is it. It's not as if the racism is irrelevant to the plot: it is one of the central plot elements. Gone with the Wind is also racist, but at least it's not about racism. This book is, and in a disgusting way.Second, it's mediocre Heinlein. Simplistic in the extreme, it's full of goofy plots twists and impossible human behavior. Not much suspense. 'Gee, we have a super weapon, how will we destroy those foolish Asians?' Bah. Read the Moon is a Harsh Mistress or Space Cadet if you want better Heinlein. ... even the fairly fascistic Starship Troopers is a much better read, and no where near as offensive."
1,implausable and a bad read,"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. It was my first heinlein book, and now i think it shall be my last as well. The idea of a weapon that eliminates people by race is laughable. that is only one of the bad concepts in this book. reading it is like a chore. THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE."
3,Early RAH,"This is one of Heinlein's earlier books, and it shows. It's entertaining, but I would not advise it to anyone but a Heinlein fan. Oh, and BTW, the book is not racist. However, it does say nasty things about Chinese culture and its rulers' traditional non-reverence for human rights and life. As events have tragically show this to be true (Tiannamen Square, anyone?), charges of racism are hardly warranted. For first time Heinlein readers, try something else."
3,Classic Early Heinlein,"Very early Heinlein. Story of a small group of patriotic scientists in a conquered United States trying to come up with a way to fight their overlords. With Yankee ingenuity and scientific inventiveness, can they succeed when the entire mightof the U.S. military failed? An important addition to your Heinlein collection."
4,makes me feel like trancescending!,I love the music off this CD. The music that is played has it's own energy that you can feel flowing through your body. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves trance and the atmosphere.
4,This album is better than you think!,"Being a true Duranie, I get quite furious when reading critics' nonsensical tearing-down of a band that has more talent in their little fingers than moronic critics will ever have! BIG THING is a good album and has great songs like the title track (great rhythm!), ""I Don't Want Your Love"" (great breakup song!), ""Do You Believe in Shame?"" and ""Lake Shore Driving"", and instrumental track which is the perfect background music for riding in the car with the windows all the way down and the volume turned all the way up!! This album shows that DD (and their distinctive sound) have matured very well! Critics may say that Duran Duran have no talent, but how have they managed to stay around for nearly 20 years?"
4,A very Good Album,"Just pick it up for ""palomino"" and ""the edge of America"". DD never made again songs like those two."
4,"...Duran Duran: post INXS' ""KICK"" album=Big Thing.","First off the cover is an eye sore. Duran Duran were listening to house music supposedly and they made this album. Duran had moderate success in 1987 with Notorious but were clearly blown out of the water by both INXS and U2 who had released ""Kick"" and ""The Joshua Tree"" respectively. Suddenly here was ""BIG THING"" which seemed graphically and musically to borrow from the INXS book of aesthetics. Simon Le Bon even had a permed mop. This is not to say they were ripping off INXS, just influenced or impressioned by them. Musically the album is the last really good one they would make for years. ""Do you believe in Shame"", ""I dont want your love"" and ""What she said (why she stayed?)"" are the doozies on here. Forgive the album cover and it's a decent album."
3,Decent release but not a fan of warren cuccurullo,"There are some good songs here and probably the strongest album featuring Warren on guitar, but I never liked him. He was an 80's hair band guitarist who was a bit of a poser. It's like Steve Vai joining Duran Duran..just doesn't fit. I don't doubt his talent, I just feel he doesn't fit. I'm glad they no longer have him in the band. Dominic Brown is a breath of fresh air...I like his playing better than Andy's even.There sound really changed on this album. I like some of their experimentation although I'm glad they are back to what they do best."
3,60% good,"This album has four rather silly pop singles on it, taking up almost all of side one(I have it on tape). Too Late Marlene is a lovely song though, too bad it wasn't on side two so I could avoid side one all together. Side two on the other hand is really good, full of rich and beautifull pieces of music, emotional, thoughtfull and meaningfull. I would recommend the album for those."
1,bad bad bad only the dvd is rescatable,the recording engineer who mastered the discs is a joke why put this guy to remaster i have the original vinyl and cd of the first edition and is better only the dvd is rescatableim buy this edtion with hight hopes and when im listen the sound is so bad why you remaster with bad architecture emi please remaster again the tape and call tu duran duran to give the okto sound bad for emi very bad for emi
1,"NOPE,IT AINT A BIG THING","DURAN DURAN WAS AMONGST THE WORST BANDS OF THE EIGHTIES ALONG WITH KAJAGOOGOO AND BANANARAMA.THEY PRODUCED SOME OF THE CHEESIEST MUSIC EVER PRODUCED.THIS IS AS BAD AS IT GETS,SO DO THE WISE THING AND AVOID THIS ALONG WITH ASTRONAUT THEIR LAST OFFERING WHICH TANKED BIG TIME."
4,These songs are so interesting that they rock!,"I have to admit that I bought this CD just because of a 10 minute clip on some girl's webpage. It only took me a few times listening to the album before I totally fell in love it. These songs are not what Duran Duran usually do, but I still love the songs. They are so unusual that they are just cool to listen to. I recommend this to anyone!"
2,This book was a disappointment.,"This book was a disappointment. After reading it, I still don't get an understanding of Wayne the man nor why he remains in the top ten of US movie stars nor why his performances resonate with ordinary Americans -- even all these years after his death. I get the impression that Wills, as a left-of-center intellectual, is still, by the end of the book, at a loss to explain Wayne beyond reciting the standard release dates and critiques of his movies, and going over his lack of military service. Wills treats Wayne respectfully, but at a distance. Wills is not reproachful toward his countrymen for their appreciation of Wayne -- he just doesn't understand why they should bother."
5,A fresh look at a great Actor,"This book is essentially a discussion about an idea.American values, & culture came to be influenced by the films & film roles of John Wayne, & the author explores that in great detail.This book helped me understand why I admire the courage, resolution, dignity, & strength that his characters displayed, & why I admire Wayne's ability to disappear into the skin of whatever character he played."
2,Little to do about an important topic,"There is an excellent essay hidden away in this book. The question is does one have the time to search it out? Some interesting insights into the making of Stagecoach (cf stuntrider Yak Canutt)and The Searchers, and some analysis of the genesis and making of The Green Berets which is frankly hilarious, but much too much padding for my taste. I remain really interested in what drives that fascinating thing, The American Mind, and if there is a collective consciousness. I realise it remains true that Arnold Schwarzenegger is better known in small villages in India than their Prime Minister but that still doesn't explain the acceptance of Wayne as the Great American Hero. Wayne's huge popularity as pointed out in the book does point to a significant part of America has an image of itself that is inherent in Wayne's persona."
4,Looking Into A Legend,"John Wayne's America is a book for the true John Wayne enthusiast. Throughout the book, Gary Wills traces the creation of an American icon through the movies and directors that formed it. Wills uses seemingly every ""John Wayne"" movie ever made citing specific examples for his points. Needless to say, unless one has some base in John Wayne's movies or a SEVERE interest in cinematography, Wills' dialogue can be a somewhat challenging reading. Although director John Ford played a major role in the making of the American icon, Wills seems to lose focus and starts chasing the career of Ford. As hard as this book was to read, it was written well, and should be included in any collection of biographies of this truly American legend."
2,Disappointing,"I like Gary Wills, and I don't write negative reviews on Amazon hardly a tall, but I thought this book was much less than it could have been. While it contains a great deal of information, it is a poorly organized hodge podge that can't decide whether it wants to be a biography of Wayne, a detailed history of the making of his motion pictures, or a meditation on pop culture.Some passages are terrific, but it should have either been boiled down into a 60-80 page essay or had much more time and effort spent on whipping the manuscript into shape. It is probably strongest in its description of the interplay of personalities, art, and business in the making of Wayne's early films, and weakest in its description of how Wayne as an icon affected mid-century America."
3,MY GRADE: B minus.,"So in this volume Spider Jerusalem manages to not come across as such a jerk probably because he tries to help his assistant come to terms with losing a boyfriend and more importantly because several people are trying to kill him. Oh he also crashes and burns with some women, too. Some of the ideas within are intriguing even if not fully detailed yet: fogletting (your life essence is put into a nanobot cloud), cryogenic preservation (with a focus on 20th century types awakened and in for a major culture shock), more sentient animals and the like (one being a bulldog cop that wants to kill Spider for neutering him). The artwork was much improved and not so confusingly shoved tightly into frames. I will continue with the series but it's not on my ""A"" list. ARTWORK: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN READ: end of March 2012."
1,awful,"If I were to poop on a Floyd cd and try to play it, this would be the sound it makes.There is only one decent reduxed song on here and it's the first, breathe was bearable. The rest were just garbage, [...] you can see that good looks apparently aren't all you need to make good music."
5,Coby TF-DVD450 DVD/MP3 player,This is a great product for kids which is the purpose I bought it for. My three year old Grandson can easily navigate its controls and it is rugged enough to withstand reasonable child handling. I comes with the necessary accessories plus a handy carrying bag. I am completly satisfied with this product. Stan
2,waste of money - disposable,"We bought this last Xmas and after 6 months it turns on, but no longer reads any CD or DVD.Complete waste of money."
5,Love It !!,"As an ""on-the-go"" busy mama of a 2 year old, this dvd player has been a life-saver at times. I read many reviews about portable players and took a chance on this one and I am so glad that I did. It's rough and tough, having been dropped a few times and still plays without skipping a beat. It's small enough for a diaper bag or purse and the picture quality is great. For our lives this dvd player is perfect with no draw backs."
1,total waste of money,Used only once and now completely unusable! Contacted Coby numerous times and kept getting the same scripted response that was not helpful in resolving the problem. Terrible customer service support!
5,durable,Great DVD player! My daughter loves it. It is really durable and has taken a beating or two already. Still works wonderful! It's so nice because the screen doesn't flip up so there is less she can break on it. I would defintely reccomend this for littler ones!!
1,Would not buy again,"This was purchased for my 9 year old daughter. Within 10 days, the headphones broke, the door on the player would not shut properly so the CD's would not play. We had to open and shut the case numerous times to get it to work. When she would pause a movie, it would not play again, we had to start it all over. This would be ideal for traveling since it comes with the plug in car adapter. But it doesn't help much when the player doesn't work."
4,Nice DVD player for kids,"My older kids asked for ipods for christmas, so I had to find an ""ipod"" for my 7 yr old. The Coby worked out great, plays DVDs & music CDs and was rugged enough to stand up to his rough play. The only down side was the bag that comes with it only holds the player, I would have liked it to be a little bigger to hold the headphones, remote, charger, etc."
1,no satisfaction,Product lasted 10 days before the prong inside the player for A/C adapter was crushed or broken off. Now there is no way to charge it and no way to have it repaired. Since it was purchased as a Christmas present a month prior to the holiday. It's now to late to have it replaced. I have a very unhappy child on my hands.
2,Ludicrous Hypothesis At Odds With Known Facts,"I gave this book two stars because it does somewhat accurately portray Lincoln in his final days. Sadly, it lacks any semblance of credibility after that. I have read every known account of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Lincoln assasination and have presented many talks on this subject. In my opinion, Balsiger's book ranks with Louis Weichmann's as one of the worst and most unreliable volumes on the subject.Factual information is either ignored, misinterpreted, or given short shrift. The ""conspiracy"" to the degree one existed was between John Wilkes Booth, Lewis Paine, George Atzerodt, and David Herold (and to a lesser degree, Michael O'Laughlin, John Surratt, and Samuel Arnold). ... Balsiger's book does little more than make sensational claims that the author cannot support without discrediting, reinventing, or ignoring historical fact."
3,a curious read,"i am not sure what to make of this book. the book is part(known) facts and part(made up?) information and i am not sure why the authors did this,possibly tocause a sensation with the book?... as if they had ""new facts"" to reveal to the american people? if i may give an example of an ""error"",the authors say on page 197(something to the effect of)...""lewis payne's COUSIN- lewis thorton powell-was the true assailant"". well,a PROVEN fact is that lewis payne was one in the same as LEWIS THORNTON POWELL!!! there was only one man here-not two.i see this book as having a high,""curiosity"" value and nothing more. i read itjust to see what the authors had to say and people can believe what the want to believe."
5,Based on government documents,Mr. Sellier sued the USA government to release sealed documents concerning the Lincoln assassination. This book was written based on these documents that were kept from the public until they were forced in court to release them. Mr. Sellier was awarded an honorary doctorate for this work. Like it or not this book reveals the facts on what really happened.
2,"Plays DVDs OK, but...","I was initially very excited about the advertised features and price of this unit. I got this thinking to replace my old CD changer and DVD player, plus gain MP3 capability for my stereo. WRONG.It plays DVDs fine. If that's all you need perhaps consider it. But it couldn't play MP3s of any kind without frequent skipping, or play CD-Rs that my old (reeeal old, like probably 10 year old LOL) player handles fine. Even as a simple CD changer it was slow and clumsy to use and would have been unsatisfactory. I was especially disappointed and surprised at Panasonic; this was more what I might have expected from a no-name brand.So there ya go, don't get this unless you only want to play DVDs on it."
2,only plays one at a time!,"I bought this DVD player because I thought you can play 5 movies at a time. It doesn't! It only plays one, and the other 4 just sit there in the machine and do nothing. If you want to see five movies at once, you'll have to buy 5 different DVD players. That's too many, and you still have to watch them one at a time."
5,Exciting and thrilling,I love this book! Although I don't understand much of military tactics I was fascinated by this book. The story and how it is told is one of the most interesting I ever read. And the best thing is: all the other books in this series are as good as Falkenberg's Legion.
5,no bullshit sci-fi,"I love the current tech and ancient military, historical tactics. I have a history degree and JEP showed graphically that the tactics and strategies have not changed over the years nor will they! Read the whole series!"
5,Probiotic Review,"This is an excellent product. My dog is 14 yrs. old and has digestion problems. I give him this product with his every meal. It keeps him alive. This price is affordable and a lot cheaper than at the Vet. Thank You Seller ! My dog thanks you also ,,,Woof....Woof ! ! !"
4,Purple Cross Cookie Cutters,I bought these as a small reward for our Jr High youth group kids. They made Christmas cookies for retirement home residents and delivered them while singing Christmas carols. I didn't know what color the cookie cutters would be because there was no photo. I was hoping for white--but they are purple! The kids liked them and the color didn't matter in the end. It sure would be nice to have a photo of each item if possible!
2,Not as pictured.,The Lemon Fantastik I received was not as pictured and did not work as well. The contents left a residue on my bathtub.
3,OK for the price,"Ordered 2, both came quickly and in original packages. Worked fine but sound a little scratchy"
3,Couldn't detect any benefit,While this is good silcone oil I didn't notice any benefit to the seals on my convertible top. In fact the oil just sat there like it couldn't penetrate the rubber which is contrary to the description. I'll use it in other applications where a silicone based lube is needed but it did nothing for my rubber seals.
4,authentic country,"This sounds like authentic, heartfelt, country gospel music. I especially enjoyed the title track. Very inspiring, spiritually uplifting and musically interesting. --- Jim Stephens"
4,4 supreme dance tracks,"This cd has only 10 tracks. but nevertheless, it is a must for dance parties or raves. one excellent gabber track (1), and 3 great trance hardtrance tracks (7,8,9). buy this cd for those songs. you'll never stop spinning them"
1,"Don't lik, think is boring.","I don't like this book, very boring, teacher made read for school. Gamers d disks jejmedje Jensen even Jen. I hate auto correct"
4,Great shipping,"The book was required reading for my daughter, and it was shipped immediately and in the condition that we expected."
3,WDJS,Very helpful to have a collection of Jesus' words with just a bit of context.It's probably not fair to give this book three stars - it delivers exactly what it promises - but that's what it gets.I was hoping Jesus's words would make more sense and contain some profound insights. Instead they are mostly confusing and unremarkable; the story of life as a brief test of character before we are judged for all eternity; the promise of salvation for those who believe and perdition for those who don't.
3,"some upbeat tracks, but not a whole lot of extended remixes...","Once again, the Free to Be series sort of cops out and does not give us full length remixes. This series could have been ideal if it had, because they include a good number of hard to find dance and club tracks. Times here:1. make it on my own (4:52)2. don't lose the magic (hitman 12"")(7:13)3. love changes (4:36) (not the house mix)4. mama said (4:07)5. tight fit (4:36)6. well i guess you (3:48)7. breaking away (3:33)8. stay (3:55)9. something so strong (3:49)10. hangin on a string (5:58)11. why should i cry (4:24)12. tour de france (6:47)"
5,THE BEST CD PLAYER I'VE EVER OWNED,I just bought this portable CD player at my local Wal-Mart and now I couldn't be happier. This is the best CD player I've ever owned. It's got a cool design and it plays CD's very well. I would strongly recommend that people purchase this item.
1,Not worth it,The only good thing I can say about this player is that it looks cool. I get better sound from the AM radio in my car.
3,Off balance,"Loved the quality of the finish, the weight of the cookware and the easy cleanup. It's great for roasting seeds and nuts and cooking everything I throw at it. Sadly, I have an electric stove and this pan does not sit level on the level burner without tipping toward the handle. ugggg..It's so frustrating. I have to prop something under the pan while I'm heating."
1,sticking fry pan,yes i bought this fry pan with to much expectations since it sticks no matter what i cook. it does clen up but you always need to let it cool prior to cleaning so it want ruin the pan. you be the judge sticks and leaves a unsightly white stain.
5,Food for the mind.,This book contains the wisdom of many Native American tribes. Through these reading we find meaning to some of lifes mysteries.
4,A mixed-bag for Pentangle fans,"Pentangle Family primarily highlights the solo efforts of both Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. The CD begins with ""Lucky Thirteen"" an acoustic composition by Jansch and Renbourn. Other solo gems from Jansch include a solo version of ""A woman like you"" with strong percussion and ""Tell Me what is True Love"". Redbourn's ""Noah and Rabbit"" and ""Can't keep from Crying"" highlight John's excellent craft work in solo guitar. Pentangle as a group is presented with cuts from it's earlier albums with songs like ""Light Flight"" and ""Once I had a Sweetheart"". Also little heard tracks from Pentangle's out of print album ""Reflection"" are highlighted here like the moving ""Wedding Dress"". Because this CD is not a complete presentation of Pentangle as a group, it would be advisable for the novice listener of Pentangle music, get ""Basket of Light"" and ""Sweet Child"". If the listener enjoys the ""Pentangle sound"" then buy The Pentangle Family."
5,We want more.,"Nil. Please hurry up with a new one. The reviews have all captured the intense appeal of your music. I keep checking this site because few other CDs generate such emotional impact, over such a broad range, while sounding spontaneous and connected at the same time. Peter Gabriel works a lot harder to combine rhythm and romance. At least it sounds that way. The current Buena Vista Social Club outings reveal the source of that intangible Cuban groove thing that seems to effortlessly insinuate itself into your bones. But unfortunately, they just don't rock out. So your fans are counting on you to provide that magic mix. My wife and I love road trips, just so we can listen and smile without interuptions. I'm at risk of vibrating the steering wheel off the stalk by beating it like bongos. So if you're taking three years trying working on perfection, just let it flow. Your fans obviously agree that more of the same would be just fine."
5,One of the best new artists out there!!!,"The entire album is fantastic! A beautiful mixture of Cuban rhythm and rock. The love songs are not typical, they are mature, expressive and passionate. The music on the album is rich and full, accentuating the beauty of the lyrics. Buy this album! You will not regret it! I hope he puts out something new soon! I can't wait!"
5,A non-fiction page turner,"Coyle has written a book, which you do not want to end, about people you don't want to say goodbye to."
1,battleX stinks! nothing like the TV ad,"in the ad it appears that the cars ""battle"" each other which looks pretty cool. In reality they just try to hit a target and pop up a little token and the first to get 2 tokens wins. big dealMy 7 year old son (and I) are very disapointed in this toy."
1,A total mistake from Hot Wheels,"We bought this toy for my 7-year-old son, it looked really cool in the store. We got it home after buying 2 of the vehicles to go with it and also weapon sets. All in all it was over $40 and was useless. It is noisy, and the cars go around and around and do nothing. Plus they are circling around so fast you can't see what is happening and if you do, you might feel dizzy after:( It is not NEARLY what we expected for the money and we are returning it tomorrow. You would be much happier buying other battling items such as Beyblades or Dual Masters cards or something else for your child, this one is a total mistake from hot wheels, I don't know what they were thinking."
1,Don't Buy This Item,Don't buy this item unless you already own the cars. They are not included with the set and are impossible to find.
1,Don't like it,"We first owned two Battle Bots and really enjoyed the action. We then received the Arena for Christmas and it did not make the tokens fly up regularly. It took up a lot of room (like Hot Wheels tracks), but was hard (impossible?) to disassemble to put away. Overall, the Battle Bots seemed like a lot more fun without this toy to go with them."
3,"Nice, but a little short","This record is well put together, however there are only four tunes at three-minutes apiece. Twelve minutes of music seems a bit short..."
2,This is a little book!,I was a bit surprised when I received this book and found that it is a very small book. This should be noted in the description. The bathroom photos are the same as in other books I have on the Craftsman Bungalow that do not specialize in just the bathroom. I had hoped there would be something different.
3,tiny format does the author great injustice,"The tiny size of the photos is really unfair to the content of the book, since it strictly limits its usefulness as design inspiration. Ditto the poor organization of textual referents to page numbers later in the book. I can much more warmly recommend Jane Powell's Bungalow Kitchens and Peter LaBau's New Bungalow Kitchen, which are vastly richer in both content (former) and visual imagery (latter)."
1,Not worth it,"If you purchase Bungalow Bathrooms by Jane Powell, do not bother with this book. It has all the same photos, and not nearly the info. or Jane's ""pun""ishing humor. It was a disappointment."
1,"stale, not worth the price.","Can you believe this tea is $25? If I got it at a grocery store, I would have returned it right away-stale, smells like dust, nothing, absolutely nothing special. Will never buy it again."
5,Mmmmmm,"I love this tea, it's the best earl grey out there. The smell and flavor is amazing. Well worth the price, it's a wonderful product in a cute tin."
3,Book Review,I enjoyed the book but found I liked the Shop on Blossum St. more.It could just have been me. Still a great read especially for knitters.
4,A Good Book,"I have to admit I feel a little nerdy reading a novel set in a yarn shop. At the same time, though, it was so fun reading about how other women (fictional though they may be) connected over knitting. I've yet to create a knitting community, though I long for one. Debbie Macomber's storytelling reminds me of Maeve Binchy, and I plan on reading the first book in the series. I did find this a bit cute, but her ease with words makes it worth a read."
5,Great series,Author recommended by a friend looking forward to reading the entire series am so pleased by the book that have already ordered additional ones in the series
4,A Good Yarn,This book was in great condition and arrived by the date it was supposed to. I'd definitely use this seller again.
2,A LONG YARN,"UNLIKE SOME OF REVIEWERS ON HERE, I WON'T END UP TYPING AN ENTIRE CHAPTER FOR MY OPINION . I'LL GET TO THE POINT.BOOK STARTS OUT INTRODUCING 4 AND SOMETIMES 5 VERY INTERESTING WOMEN WITH CHALLENGING, COMPLEX AND BELIEVABLE PROBLEMS . MISS MACOMBER HAD MY INTEREST THRU OVER HALF THE LONG BOOK. THEN CAME THE PREDICTIBLE TYING UP OF LOOSE ENDS . VERY QUICKLY , ALMOST MIRACLE LIKE, ALL THE CHARACTERS PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED AND THEY ALL LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER & OH YES, "" HALLELUJAH "" THE LEAD CHARACTER IS NOW CANCER FREE !! AMEN .FOR THOSE WHO LOVE KNITTING AND LIKE THIS SORT OF NO BRAIN STRAIN READ, "" AND CAN'T SLEEP UNLESS ALL ENDS WELL "" , IT WILL NO DOUBT BE TOUTED AS BOOK OF THE YEAR .I TOO ENJOY LIGHT FICTION AND LOVE STORY, HOWEVER , WITH A BIT MORE BELIEVABILITY AT THE END EVEN IF NOT EVERYONE LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER . TRY AUTHOR ANITA SHREVE !!!!!"
5,Very Good book,"I purchased this book not sure of what to expect. After the first chapter I couldn't wait to finish. I finished this book in just a few days and I am not an avid reader. Debbie Macomber has become one of my favorite authors and I find myself looking for all of her books. This book is excellent, just like the others I've read from her."
5,"""Could not put it down""","Just like A Shop On Blossom st. I could not put this book down,My son had an interesting comment being 9 I thought it was great, Mom that book is like your knitting one more row, one more page.I hope there is more to come for this series. THANK YOU"
5,GREAT SERIES,I love reading Debbie's books and this new series is GREAT!! I wish I could be apart of a knitting group but living in a very rural area makes it difficult. This series is comforting and it's like being with your girlfriends and having fun for a few hours once a week. Being a shut in I really enjoy this series!!
2,Predictable and Bland,"I found the characters in A Good Yarn rather cliché: the divorcee who is still in love with her gambling ex-husband; the gambling ex-husband with a heart of gold; the woman who finds courage to start a career when her husband of 20-odd years dumps her for a younger woman; the rebellious teenager; the wise grandmother, ad nauseum. The plot was predictable: of course the teenager loses the weight and ends up going to the homecoming dance with the football teem quarterback/Homecoming King; of course the goodhearted ex-husband gambler is dying of cancer and mostly reformed. The best that can be said of the writing was that it was redundant; for example, Macomber writes how the gambler's luck at the casinos influenced his moods, and then tells us in the very next sentence that he was happy when he won and depressed when he lost, as if it would have been the other way around. I didn't particularly sympathize with any of the characters or their situations."
3,"Same Characters, Different Names","While I really enjoyed The Shop on Blossom Street, A Good Yarn simply wasn't. It was pretty much the same story, only not as heartwarming. There was the angry, the broken, and the discouraged women all over again and I found it difficult to fall into the story and get involved with the characters. Also, these characters were less 3-dimensional than the Blossom Street book; their individual stories a bit more contrived. Still, Macomber is an excellent writer and it is a well-written story. I might have enjoyed it more if I had not read the first in the series."
5,Sweet,"What a sweet and delightful novel this one is. Very romantic, full of love and generosity....as well as the women in the knitting class. Debbie Macomber has given us a delightful read. One in which i did not want to put downalso read: Full Bloom by Janet Evanovich and the hot-Fire In The Ice by Katlyn Stewart"
5,My favorite hobby!,"This was the first book of Debbie Macomber that I read and I hav e enjoyed many since. I love reading about her knitting shop and the other shops on the stree where she has her store, her little dog Yorkie (I forget his name) and other characters in her stories. I have b een a knitter siince I was 9 years old in Scotland and next to reading, I woould say this is my favorite past time. I just celebrated my 80th birthday, and I am sure there are not enoough years left for me to enjoy all her books!"
4,A Good Yarn,I thought the characters were warm and charming as most of the ones are in Debbie's books. I found it easy and stressfree reading.
5,A Good Yarn,I just love the blossom street series.The book is hard to put down. I plan on reading the rest of series
2,Not my style,"First and last Debbie Macomber book I've ever read. Too sappy, way to predictable, and the writing not very interesting. It may work for some, but not for me."
3,"simple, take it for what it is","I read this as part of my book club - we wanted to read something a bit ""lighter"" than our past selections. Well this is certainly light, and we found little to discuss or explore. The characters were very one dimensional and the story predictable. I felt a bit like I was reading a preteen novel. I wouldn't even consider it a good beach read - just boring and slow moving. Certainly not a page-turner."
5,Never disappointed with Debbie,Here is a another excellent book from Debbie Macomber. I couldn't put it down. The theme of this book you could really see happening in a little town. Knitters will love it.
4,classic Macomber,"If you like Debbie Macomber, this is more of the same. The recipe & knitting pattern are fun extras.I like that the characters from the first book (""shop on blossom street"") made believable appearances here and interacted with the new characters in logical ways. So many serial books don't acknowledge what happened earlier; or popular characters show up for no good reason, the author pandering to readers/publisher demands. The original ""classmates"" only appeared briefly and they helped the new characters on their new life/career paths with skills or information the author already revealed in the first book. That's what I like best about Macomber: Her belief that a quality life grows out of participating in a community with compassion and sincerity, is the heart of every book/character development."
4,Just a warm and touching Story,"I have read Debbie Macomber's ""The Shop on Blossom Street"" and I thought that book was just a wonderful story. Again the author didn't disappoint me with this delightful tale ""A Good Yarn"". The story continues with the shop in Seattle that was opened by Lydia Hoffman, a cancer survivor. A new knitting class is created this time the project is knitting socks. New ladies appear in the class which I enjoyed their characters. No need to go into detail as there are numerous reviews already. Overall, this is a special, warm and touching story that I highly recommend. Bye."
3,Just OK - there are better books out there,"I didn't think this book was anything special. The writing is not very good, and I didn't think the photography was very good - the places are fantastic, but I think that's the only reason people think the pictures are nice - because the places are nice, not because the skill of the photographer is anything to write home about.For a REALLY spectacular travel book to inspire you, check out Lonely Planet's book ""Travel"" - the photos are just incredible, and it will inspire you to start packing your bags."
5,love true crime? get this book!,"There was a tv movie made about Blanche Taylor Moore. I believe Elizabeth Montgomery? played Blanche. I watched it and then went hunting for the book. I finally found it used, from a local bookshop. The tv movie doesnt even begin to cover what and who this woman was, the evil she caused and the lives she wrecked. The book is very graphic, but worth the reading. It reminds me of Helter Skelter by Mr. Bugliosi; you watch the movie version and go find the book. Tv movies leave a lot out."
2,dreadfully dull,"The Calling stinks, plain and simple. What initially had potential with a boy being possessed by the devil quickly falls apart thanks to a lackluster storyline and mediocre acting skills.Sure, you witness a few neat looking and terrifying deaths, but the majority of the film is amazingly quiet and doesn't trigger any kind of suspense or fear from the viewer. This is because the storyline never takes an interesting turn so you eventually know what's going to happen at the very end.Okay, one particular scene involving the mother taking her little boy to a river is a bit shocking (because it actually plays out in a way I didn't expect) but other than that, this is another example of predictable writing, poor acting skills, and lack of suspense ruining a supposed thriller."
4,Evil has a name and its name is Dylan,"Maybe Dylan isn't his name. Maybe its Bob. Whoever it is, he is still a whimp compared to damien. Have you seen this movie? I am watching it now so I don't really know what its about yet. I will now watch it instead of writing this stupid review. Was this review helpful to you? Probably not."
3,"Good for consumer use, but not for office use","I recently purchased this printer for use in my law firm to replace my HP OfficeJet d135. The print quality is less than the d135, but that may be because it uses less ink on purpose.One thing I do like about the C6180 is that the cartridges are reasonably priced -- the black goes for $20, and the color cartridges (there are 5 or 6) go for $10 apiece. The good thing about it having several color cartridges is that you only have to buy the ones that have run out, rather than a tricolor cartridge that holds all the color ink (which costs about $29).The salesperson at the store where I bought it told me that it would be fine for office use. The only other alternative is another OfficeJet with a much larger footprint.I think that this printer would be great for consumer/home use, but I question its effectiveness for office use. If I had to make the decision again, I would probably spend the extra money and get an OfficeJet which is designed for office use."
2,Good printer with very bad software,"This printer seems well built and solid but the software package that comes with it is terrible!The software wouldn't SCAN properly and reported memory errors at resolutions over 600dpi. The HP software loads each time you boot the computer and runs in the background and causes other unrelated computer functions to S-L-O-W down (2.6 Ghz Celeron machine with 768 Meg RAM). When shutting the computer down for the night, the HP software would cause it to hang with a message that the HP software was not responding - even during sessions when the HP software wasn't used at all.I called HP tech support 3 times and worked with them for hours and hours. HP's solution is to uninstall and reinstall the software over and over and over again on each machine on the network.I returned the machine after 1 week."
2,not bad printing but everything else is a hassel,"By far the biggest annoyance is the calibration that it goes through at exactly the wrong time - every time. It takes for ever to finish and sounds like its factory inside. The paper feed does not come out very far and the picture paper holder sits right on top and can not move. I have never used the photo paper tray and yet it tells me sometimes that I have to put it down, when it's never been up and won't clear until I give it a good whack or reboot which takes about an hour. I would not recommend this product. Toner cartridges don't last either."
3,New Printer,An excellent all-in-one printer. I like the fact that the cartridges are split up so that one can be replaced for less than $10 per color vs. replacing a much more expensive cartridge every time a color runs out. Very quiet and fast compared to my previous hp.
4,Easy as pie,Easy set up right out of the box and beautiful results to boot. If HP could only make a decent set of drivers this would be the best printer I've ever owned.
2,buggy software -typical CHEAP HP inkjet,"I've had the HP C6180 for about a year - it had been nothing but trouble. It SUCKS ink and the cartridges are expensive. There are six ink cartridges - if any one of the six are low or empty and really when isn't that the case, you have all kinds of trouble trying to print. It keeps popping up a message that pink is empty, you can't just tell it to print in black and go on without getting a pop-up for each page!!!It no longer recognizes my wireless network, so I have to carry the laptop in and plug it in to print. No help from the tech support.Just recently it has started turning itself off - or when it goes to sleep mode, then when I tell it to print, it gives me a message that says ""improper shut down"", and it starts making all kinds of noises, etc.I came to Amazon to search for its replacement - this is the third HP in 3 years - they are not what they used to be."
3,Fine... right up until it died,"I've had this machine for just over a year and have been quite happy. Unlike most of the reviewers, I had no software issues. The scanner spoke with my Mac without problem. The wi-fi is great and all the features worked well (although I agree that the ink prices are usurious).I loved the scan feature, particularly. I was using it to put old photos on my hard drive. The process was somewhat slow, but it worked great. Until one day last week I went to scan a photo and it just wouldnt work. Ive done everything I can think to do. All the other functions still work (I can copy and fax from the feeder tray) but nothing will scan off of the glass case. I have no idea what occasioned this event but I am annoyed. Even in this age of throwaway technology, I expect to get more than a year out of a piece of office equipment."
1,Don't buy this printer,"I originally chose this printer because of the wifi capabilities, and that is the only feature that I am happy with.It's a piece of crap! Don't buy it!The printing operation goes smoothly about 1/10 times. There is always some error that requires troubleshooting.It is an ink cartridge guzzler and costs about [...] to operate.I am very disappointed with this purchase, and am surprised that the reviews here on Amazon are generally positive."
2,"All functions on an ""All in One Printer"" should work","I have had my Photosmart C6180 for about 18 months. I use a Macbook and operate the printer wirelessly. When I first got the unit, I was astounded at the huge software file that was downloaded for the thing. Later updates further add to the bloatware. My scanner has never worked well. Not sure why. Seems to work when it wants to. I have installed the software 10 times and updated the drivers. Granted, some of this has taken place in the middle of operating system revisions ( I now run Leopard 10.5) So....I don't quite know who to blame. Downloaded HP driver revisions today from the Apple site ( 90 MB) and still my scanner doesnt work. When I plug in the USB cable, it works fine, wirelessly ....forget about it. HP offered to upgrade me to a newer model for $220 bucks. Think I will try something else. Anybody got any ideas? Prints pretty good after it goes through alot of gyrations. It is a pretty unit but who needs the headaches?"
2,"Jams, won't scan, won' t print on card stock","My mother just got this printer a couple of months ago and we're shopping for a replacement for her already. It jams all the time, won't print on card stock, and the scan function will not work locally at all. We can get it to scan by going to the HP web site and using their online software only.I have always had success with HP products. This is a big disappointment."
3,"Good only for pictures, bad software","I bought this printer because my wife is a teacher and wanted to print some color prints for her students. The quality of the prints is acceptable, but if your prints contain a lot of text as well, then the black ink will run out so fast you won't believe it. Quality of pictures is OK, but if you want the printer primarily for pictures you should consider that the color cartridges will also run out very fast because they are very small.A major negative point that another reviewer discusses is the software: after installing the software on my laptop, it takes an extra 5 to 10 minutes to start it up, seriously. The printer software is clearly to blame because if I kill any hp processes running from the task manager (if I manage to open it), my laptop immediately beomes much faster. That's a major complain, I'm at the point of considering to uninstall the software from my laptop..."
2,scan terrible cs did not help,Every scan I have tried is full of white specks. I contacted customer service. They sent a replacement and I had the same results. They first claimed defective hardware (the hp6180) and now they just don't care. I'm stuck with it. I had a good printer and needed the scanner. Don't bother getting this one if you plan to scan pictures.
5,Another great printer from HP,"So far so good - excellent print quality, especially photographs. The only negative is that the first page you send after the printer has been idle, takes quite a while. If you can be patient, you will be pleased!"
5,Good Value for the Buck,"This is a good machine for the dollar value one has to pay for it. One must remember this is not a commercial printer. I also like the smaller size and the ability of document size paper, our old HP didn't have these assets. Have not tried the photo printing of this machine as of yet. Have used it to read the photos. We just purchased our first digital camera so am learning to use it first. Am sure that the printer will do as advertised on photos since it has done quite well in printing and copying. Only draw back is the lag time between telling it to copy and it starts to copy. This fault may be in my computer setup though."
5,1 month in and its the best printer I've had,"I've had lasers, inkjets even dot matrix from most makes and this printer is by far the best I have had. It was easy to install, has great status on ink level and is very fast. At times it can be a little noisy after the print?"
4,HP C6180,"The hardware is excellent as was the delivery from Amazon. The software is mediocre. It is very large and ""works"" clumsily on my Dell laptop but does not work on my HP desktop. The field support is non-existent. Talking to the associates is just plain frustrating as they send you back and forth within HP until you give up and seem to love to say it's all Microsoft's fault anyway."
4,photosmart 6180 review,"The printer itself works great. The fax,copy and scan functions are easy to use and give great results. Photo prints are very sharp and clear with good color renditioning. The only problem I had was in getting the software loaded on my laptop in wireless mode. Tech support was pretty much useless. After 3 hours on the phone they pretty much gave up and sent me to the laptop tech support people who didn't have a clue what to do. A friend suggested that I try to install the printer hardwired to my router and that worked. A couple software problems have also arisen where the digital monitoring function or hp CUE software reguarly shuts down and the computer must be rebooted to restart it. This is an HP acknowledged problem but no fix is yet available."
2,WORST PRINTER I HAVE EVER OWNED,"The copier has a ""fast"" print option. HOWEVER...1)you cannot default to this ""FAST"" print, and if you can.. it doesn't tell you how2)You have to choose it before each page you print, even in succession3)Even if you do choose, it doesn't always work4)Seems like there is ""fast"" which isn't so fast.. but better than regular, and ""faster"" you never know what you are going to get.PLUS, continually get error messages like ""INK SYSTEM FAILURE"" or PAPER JAM, almost NEVER can I sit down to print and NOT have a problem.When you autofeed from the top, it copies your papers in REVERSE order, so you have to resort. WHat a waste of time!!!WORTHLESS!!!"
5,Great printer!,"I love this printer. It does everything and does it well. I love that it's wireless, so I can print from my laptop anywhere in the house. The pictures that it prints are beautiful. I'll never pay someone else to develop my pictures again. The unit itself is really compact and cute. I love this printer!"
3,Not what was promised!!,"The printer was very much over-sold by HP sales support reps. Now that I have the printer and use it everyday, it isn't all that was promised to be.I need to create a number of PDF files from scans and was fully assured that this would not be a problem, yet it has become a problem. The scanner itself is slow and not very intuitive.Tech support was insulting, especially the center in Canada. The rep was so condescending, interruptive and acted like he was doing ME a favor by merely taking my call. I won't even get into the center over seas except they need to learn to understand the English language.Set up was fairly easy and even the basic user could handle it. The SW for the printer has created many issues with my XP system and to get HP to get that fixed is not an easy task. I constantly get printer errors that ends up shutting down the printer or my system, so BE VERY AWARE of this.I'm assuming there are better systems out there but I went by the review I read on CNET."
3,software not so good,"The printer prints ok, the color was not quite as good as the original, I expected better The scanner seems cumbersome to use The fax works great The document feeder works great The wireless works ok. The software is bad, I keep getting an errors message at shut down (program not responding).This is a replacement for my returned 1st printer. The first printer/scanner had dirt under the glass and put a white streak down the picture (poor quality controll). The tech support is fast to answer the calls and the replacement was fast. But you can't understand there support peoples English, the last person I talked to wasn't very helpful or knowledgeable. I was instructed to turn my computer off then back on like it was going to fix the problem.I give the printer C for all around marks. And an D for software and tech support"
3,"Noisy as hell, but prints are OK","The HP C6180 shakes, wobbles, regurgitates, snorts, clunks, and vibrates while it noisily prints a great copy. When it's finished printing, it shakes, wobbles, etc. etc. Would I have bought it had I known this? Probably not."
5,Great product,"Te product is great, the service is great. Delivery was promt. However, the unit broke within a day basically. It stopped using the light magenta and magenta. I had to return the unit to HP. This is when nightmare began. I sent the item using their return box and receipt. The item was delievered on Dec. 5, but they claimed they did not receive it and charged my credit card. The matter is still not settled. HP shame on you!"
2,Slow slow slow,"If you need somthing cheap and reliable this could be what you are looking for. But for speed, multiple copies this is like watching ice melt in winter. We have one and now have to get rid of it for something that does not take forever to warm up and make copies."
2,YOU WILL BE SORRY!,Will not read memory card on the network with Vista. Scanner on my machine looks really bad. BIG MISTAKE buying this thing. HP support is cue-less.
1,Wouldn't buy again due to the software,I have owned this model for a few years. Its great... EXCEPT for the fact that the software is abominable. It installs a complex myriad of applications and they lock up more often than they run. I tried updating the software and the installation failed. I have given up using it from the PC completely including using it as a printer. I was conintuing to use it for scanning and faxing (scanning to a USB fob works well.)Not any more! Their design is prohibiting me from doing this - they check their ink cartridges for an expiration date and ink level. The device says I need to replace the ink and will NOT allow me to use the fax or scan functions until I do so!!! I can't print with it and now I can't scan or fax with it.Avoid HP for these products.
1,Great printer. Horrible ink,"I absolutely LOVE everything about this printer except the ink. Whenever a document gets wet, even just a little bit, the ink bleeds everywhere rendering the machine useless. Even when pages are given time to dry they still bleed. Plus, the ink fades dramatically over time. I have recipes that i have pulled out and they are almost unreadable and only a couple years old. than, of course if something splashes on it, the ink bleeds. I will most likely not buy another HP printer."
1,Unit fails with false ink replacement notifications,"When working this is an excellent printer.....This is my 2nd HP and 1st the wireless became disabled and now it repeatedly states I need to replace the yellow cartridge. Check the net, many have had this problem. Tech fixes help some but not mine. This printer is junk. No more HP all in ones for me, going to the new Canon,"
1,Maddening product,"This printer worked OK for about three years before descending into a series of ink system problems, power supply issues. I was able to get it going several times by trying oddball fixes on the Net (take out the yellow ink, unplug ... ) but have finally had enough. Do a search on the model # and problems and see what you get. Don't even think about this one."
1,Won't Scan to Mac!,"Despite multiple attempts, I'm unable to get this machine to scan a document to my MacBook Pro computer. I've gone through the reinstallation of drivers and through the HP troubleshooting process on their web site over and over without any success. I'm going to sell or give away this piece of junk and purchase a scanner/printer from another company."
1,this printer is not reliable,"i have never been able to set this printer up to work wirelessly, which is why i purchased it in the first place. i've spent many saturdays trying to set it up...i've been on the phone with hp customer service for hours. it has never worked.i finally resigned myself that it won't so i have been using the scanner option only. i decided to try it as a printer again 6 months later & can not b/c it says there is a ink cartridge error. i trouble shot that for awhile, then determined it must be out of ink. so i spent $50 on all new ink cartridges only to find the SAME ERROR.so the rundown is...i've owned this printer for 4 years & it's only worked as a scanner, when scanning to an sd card.worthless.i was so convinced that hp was the way to go when researching printers to purchase. i will never buy an hp printer again."
4,good,"The printer is pretty good for xp operating system. for using with vista, need to download additional software from hp website. the networking is pretty good with xp than with vista. overall a good printer needs little bit improvement for vista operating system. The shopping experience with amazon is amazing. delivered in time."
2,Be wary!,"My family recently purchased this all-in-one printer to replace our old, also HP all-in-one. We networked it to three computers, which is a great function that comes with the printer, the main desktop, my laptop, and another work laptop..all within about 10 feet of each other. The first couple of months were great! Good faxing, good/quick printing, nice little view screen for digital pictures, etc.However, now on midway through my third month, I feel like I have the PRINTER FROM HELL. No joke! For every ten pages it prints, about nine come up messed up with smeared ink marks and crushed/crumpled pages. It's godsent when I finally get one properly working! Also, the scanning function stopped working for some random reason! I had to scan..from a website (on HP support site) which was a hassle to get onto every time. Also, it always claims that it is ""busy"" doing God knows what.I feel like I have printer with the spirit of a spoiled, whiney girl in it! Avoid it (for normal use/networking)!"
3,"Good, but make sure its right for the job","This printer is good in terms of its ease of setup and use. It's print quality is excellent, and the wireless is great, but DO NOT put this printer to use in a high volume environment. In the past three months I have spent more than the printer's purchase price on ink. If you are only printing a couple pages a day, then this printer is fine, but any kind of volume more than 20 pages a day and you will find this printer to be much more expensive than other printers with 4x the initial price."
2,Some annoying things about this printer,"I've owned this unit for about two weeks. It had all the features I wanted, but I am disappointed by several things. 1) There is quite a delay between PRINT from the computer and when the job actually starts on the printer, maybe a minute. Mine is setup using the WiFi feature. It's not a warm-up thing. EVERY print job is delayed. Print 5 things, wait 5 minutes. Unacceptable IMHO. 2) My unit has a faint buzzing sound that is rhythmic, ""buzz, buzz, buzz."" Annoying when I am trying to write or concentrate on something. 3) Copy or scan is incredibly noisy, all kinds of clicks, whirs, rollers, etc. I have to leave the room if I'm on the phone. Print quality and features are great for the money. But these disadvantages mean a trip back to the store with my return slip."
1,Bad printer,I'm on my third printer now. The first was printing to much ink on the paper leaving smears. The second printer's fax completely quit working. The third's fax dials out but won't connect to fax machines. Plus the third printer is crumpling paper. The printer software wants to update way to often causing problems with Vista. The is the last HP product I will ever purchase.
1,Works Great - When It Works,"I agree with all of the great things folks have said. However, if you have Vista and Wireless, get ready for numerous long sessions with Tech Support in India. I'll spare the details, but trust me...fixing this printer is very, very difficult, even for advanced support.As we speak, I am installing the printer a 4th time, and dreading talking to Tech Support in India. There has to be a better way!"
4,Works well for me,"This replaced another wireless all in one HP printer. It is a bit noisy, as other reviewers have noted, but other than that, I have no problems with it. It squeeks a bit when printing. but the quality and speed is great. I have no complaints."
3,Not a network all-in-one,"The unit's OK and it works well on USB. I like it as a connected all-in-one, except that the paper holder is TINY -- you have to fill it up constantly.There is very little functionality installed as a network unit. It prints, but that's it. I can't see the memory slots, can't make it scan or do anything that requires input from the unit. HP has tried to solve my network issues, but their solutions are extremely complicated and difficult to use. Just forget this as a network unit."
2,C6180 Scan Problems,"I had this printer for a month. All the functions except scanning worked fine. Software easy to install. All functions worked either networked or over USB.Unfortunately, scanned pictures were covered with white spots. Looked like white dust spects. Copying the picture worked fine, no white spects. Spend 5 hours with HP support with no resolution. Ultimately, I returned the printer to the seller. Otherwise, I really like the printer and it's functionality."
2,Great idea that won't work for me.,"I had numerous problems installing this on both of my Toshiba laptops as a wireless network printer. Never could get it to install at all as a USB printer. That's the good news. The bad news is, after finally getting the installation to go through as a network printer, it tied up 50% of my Toshiba processor. It does interface with my wireless router, and it prints, but the software screws up my computer.I uninstalled it and the processor was fine. Reinstalled it and the problem came back. I spent several hours working with HP to no avail. Back to the store with it."
2,"High printer cartridge consumption, annoying interface","Well, I must admit the printer is a fast and easy to set up network printer. However, there are some very annoying factors:-- I don't know how they worked this, but I print mainly black. Nonetheless, the color cartridges are continuously depleting. I go through a new set of cartridges every month.-- When it gets low, it asks you to print 'black only', but then you have to walk to your printer (defeats the wireless purpose) to hit 'OK' to print the paper.-- I can not get the scanner to work wirelessly. It states 'out of memeory' (I have two gigs of ram, so I don't think that is the issue).Just my two cents."
1,bad mistake,"I bought this printer for use in my church.....and was it ever one bad bad mistake. Every piece of paper out of it jammed. Nothing came out of it smooth/easy - was a disaster. I did return it - got a total refund and would never again buy this particular model again. I have a HP all in one 2710 I bought about 3 years ago for my own personal use and what a great machine it has been but as is wont in the commercial world, it is no longer made - but this model printer C6180 is for the birds - or better for the trash can. I hesitated even giving it a one star - guess that would be because it was easy to get out of the box."
2,"Miss my old printer! Too slow, too noisy, too finicky","I replaced my old Epson printer with the Photosmart because I wanted a fax machine. I have been regretting it ever since. The HP Photosmart C6180 is way too slow -- seems to take twice as long as my old printer. It is also constantly doing something it calls ""Printer Preparation"" which involves making a huge amount of noise. The scanner is slow and strangely complicated to use. I am mystified by the good reviews this printer has gotten. Maybe I got a lemon? It seems very user UNfriendly to me."
3,Acceptable,"The printer performs generally as advertised. It prints well, with good color clarity. Since I would expect any of today's printers to produce good print results, I look to the user-interface for distinguishing features. This printer has an awkward and small paper loading tray. Its 22 buttons (not including telephone dial keypad) are a bit much, especially because there's also an interface screen. Its wireless interface has not worked yet. Unfortunately for me, the single biggest reason I bought this printer was to be able to print wirelessly. Maybe it's my firewall, but doesn't everyone run a firewall? As usual, the Help screens only offer the most basic of help. The printer has six ink cartridges, and while I haven't kept good records of ink costs, it seems that I'm replacing ink cartridges much more than previously."
2,Will not scan or fax wirelessly...no matter what you do!,"There are some good qualities--I can print wirelessly and I've scanned some photos with good results. The problem is that one cannot scan wirelessly or fax wirelessly, which was one of the main reasons why I bought this printer for my home office. I recommend doing a Google search to review the countless complaints similar to the ones I've outlined here. Very disappointing...so buyer beware!"
2,I hate it.,"As a piece of hardware, the printer is fairly sound. Unfortunately, this printer frustrates the heck out of me every single time I print. I hate this printer.When printing, papers shoot all over the floor and I ALWAYS have to recollate after printing jobs greater than 2 pages. The software is good as far as making the install and connection to the network very easy; however, EVERY time you print, the software leaves a new orphaned process (HPOID.EXE) running that will eventually crash your computer if you don't reboot regularly. When a colored ink cartridge is used up --in the middle of a print job, let's say--the printing stops and leaves you with the choices of inserting a new ink cartridge or cancelling and restarting the print with fewer colors. I would have preferred an option to continue printing without yellow."
4,C6180 is great,This unit works as advertized. I am using it daily... only problem was that unit was left on my front porch without my signature... luckly I arrived just as UPS was about to leave.
2,"Good print quality, but cheap hardware and crappy software.","Decent print quality, but the sheet feeder broke after the second time using it, and the software is absolutely awful. The memory leaks every time you print something, the UI could use much improvement, cannot colour scan at 600 dpi or above (although they claim 1200 dpi). Read my full review here: http://slumbuddy.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/death-by-1000-paper-cuts/"
1,USED HP Photosmart C6180 Printer,"This printer was dirty and had been sitting around with dry ink cartridges in it. It was packed in a way that allowed foam packing to get into all the openings. The box was partially bent in when I received it, and it was 2 weeks slow in arriving. I still haven't been able to clean the printheads to make all of them work. It was sold as something it isn't and I am extreme unhappy with the merchant that sold it. I would never buy from him again. He also sent the wrong cable to hook up the printer to my computer and the box he sent was full of miscellaneous cables that I didn't need. My rating is based on the condition of this particular printer and NOT on the brand."
2,Mostly a letdown,"Printing at home is a hassle with every printer. No exception here. It's nearly impossible to print to this thing with a PC, even if you're connected by USB. Even from a Mac it's rare that I can successfully print using wireless. Sometimes it will work, then without changing a thing, next time it no longer works. Pretty much always a frustration. Pretty much always involves steps you shouldn't have to take. Scan/copy functions are just about as easy as you'd expect, however. I like that you can plug USB memory right into the front. I like that you can plug memory cards directly into the front. It's got some nice features, but printing...still not there."
1,It's JUNK,"I could deal with the slow start-up, the ridiculous noise, and the costly ink cartridges that don't last long even with minimal use. But I've HAD IT! We had a power outage and now the thing doesn't work right. I get a repeated ""Improper Shutdown"" message. I've done a complete reset that clears the error message. But when I re-connect to our wireless network and try to print anything, it comes back again. I've done this FIVE times now. I could probably use a 20 foot USB cable, but I paid for wireless capability that is now unavailable. For all I know, it will do the same with a cable. I now own a big paperweight. Don't buy it. You can certainly do better. I'm junking it."
3,Photo Scanner Quality,The scanner is everything it needs to be other than photo scanning quality. I had a old HP 4C series scanner is better than this one. The picture quality is too graining it may be user error. I will look into it.
1,Two items missing,"This is my first negative post ever! I did not receive the CD or the fax/telephone line hook-up. I ordered a C7280 and received what I ordered but received a statement inside the box of a C7280 that it was a C6180. Plus, they would not communicate with me when I tried over and over again in a polite friendly manner as I thought at first it was an employee error, now I know different due to their lack of response. It still sits here in its original box with its contents that were sent to me."
1,Awful Printer,"This printer is terrible. I have had nothing but problems with it. Constant message for paper upside down with plain paper. Bought expensive HP paper and get the same message. Runs through cartridges like there is no tomorrow. Frequent paper jams, misaligned paper with cockeyed printing despite posted on line remedies. Will never buy another HP printer. Have rarely been able to print photos with this-always some problem."
5,Unique and interesting,These are gorgeous and unusual sterling earrings--the PERFECT length. Very impressed. Lots of compliments and questions on these. Be careful wearing the earrings with a jacket or turtleneck as the material will move the earrings out of your ears and they can be easily lost. Solved that problem by using a clear plastic earring back. No problem with clothes that do not touch the earrings. Very pleased.
5,Better than recent material by The Auteurs,"Finally, singer/songwriter Luke Haines has found a good reason to sound angry. I never beleived he was as p****d as he pretended to be on The Auteurs 3rd album, After Murder Park, especially considering how lighthearted and whimsical those first two Auteurs albums were. With Baader Meinhoff, however, skilled songwriter Haines has some concrete subject matter to sink his teeth into. The songs, roughly based on that infamous German terrorist organization, are downright creepy. The use of traditional Middle-Eastern instrumentation combined with electric guitar, funky keyboards, and raspy vocals make this a wonderfully disturbing rock album."
4,Learning Music,"After reading this book, I felt like I was back in Elementary school. This is a great learning book and if music interests you, you should read it. I love music and I felt I could expand my knowledge of it so I read this book and I didn't regret a moment of it."
4,Tangerine Hairdye,"This doll's clothes are cool, but the hair is wierd. Sure it's cool and all, but Sasha with white hair is just strange.Her pants have that net type thing wich is great. The white makes Sasha's natural buety stand out. Though I belive that playing with Bratz sparks imagination, they should give the groups better names. Not stuff like ""I-Candy"", it teaches wrong things.The only reason I'm not sure I want this Sasha is because of the orange. If bougt her I wouldn't want to keep her in the same clothes the whole time, but her hair may not match alot of other Bratz clothes."
3,Sasha!!! WHAT HAPPEND!!!!!!!,This doll has bad clothes!! Who ever created this need to change the clothes!!! I'm NOT getting this doll!!~*Princess Stella
2,what happened sasha ?!,first i discoverd that dana and saha have alot of simerlarities okay first dana has silver hair so does sasha then dana has bright purple lips then sasha has bright orange lips okay we get their like the same except this is like a black dana oh sorry dont think im rascscist
2,Can You say UGLY???!!!!!!!!?,this bratz is soooo ugly i mean come on white hair?If i were you i would not get this!
1,Blleeeccchhh!,"This sasha doll is absoulutly revolting! Sasha is my favorite Bratz and I know a bad Sasha when I see one and I just saw one. I didn't buy it and I don't plan to. Kids who want a Sasha doll, DO NOT GET THIS ONE!!!! There is a new kind of Bratz dolls called Bratz Rock Angelz and Sasha is in that collection. That Sasha is not perfect but she is SSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better looking than this one. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!WHAT HAPPEND TO SASHA?????,"WHAT A STARNGE SASHA DOLL.SHE HAVE AN ORANGE LIPSTIK,WHITE AND ORANGE HAIR????WHAT IS THAT.THE BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ SASHA IS 100000%TIMES BETTER THAN THIS ONE.I WILL NEVER GET TO BUY A DOLL LIKE THIS DOLL.I AM A HUGE BRATZ FAN AND MY SCENE FAN.THE OTHER SAHSA DOLLS ARE BETTER THAN THIS ONE.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*BUT NOT A LOVER ON THIS ONE!!!"
1,Huh? What's with the orange lips?,Sasha has white hair - that's cool; she's has orange lips - that's NOT COOL!Buy some other Sasha instead.
3,A treatise on crap,"If you can slug your way through the often bloated academic text, this book will provide many insights into the nature and history of pseudo-art or ""kitsch."" Essays by various commentators expose bad taste across the gamut of popular culture: visual and performing arts, film, architecture, religion, advertising, even recreation."
1,"old news, out of date and, as it should be, out of print","The two essays wotrth reading in this book, Greenberg's and Broch's, are both seminal essays on the issue of kitsch and contemporary culture. All other texts, especially Dorfle's, are hopelessly out-date and hopelessly out of touch with the signifigance of the narrowing gap between high and low art. The basic premise of the book: High art is good, low art is bad, is dull and un-nuanced. Wothwhile as an example of the last dying gasps of modernism and a relic of 1960's anti-authority naivete, but that's all."
4,Passion Minus Peter Gabriel,"Some of us think The Passion is Peter Gabriel's best work. This album, much less influenced by him, shows that the source material (some ""sources of inspiration"" and some used in the soundtrack of The Last Temptation of Christ) stands up as well as its progeny. Though it doesn't flow as well as the Gabriel album, it is an excellent showcase of African, Middle, and Near Eastern music--perfect for getting a first or second taste of these increasingly popular forms."
3,IT KEEPS YOU RUNNIN,When this came out the reviews were not good. I was wondering what they were talking about because I thought it was fine. Don't know what the problem was. Good print and color. C6
3,holds your interest,"The review title I gave The Marrying Man pretty much says it all. I was curious to see what was going to happen to the characters in the movie from beginning to end. I won't give any spoliers. All I can say is that you need to watch this movie for yourself. Though it might not be one of Kim Basinger's or Alec Baldwin's best films, I'm willing to bet that you will be entertained from start to finish as I was."
2,older movies,"this seems like a just a normal dvd, no really features. blu ray not worth the blu ray title.however if you can get it cheap, or a fan of Kim Basinger or Alec Baldwin, only reason to buy blu ray, better stick to regular DVD."
4,the marrying man,"product was in excellent condition and the movie was great. I have NEVER had any type of problems ordering from Amazon. Once again, thank you"
4,light and enlightening readingfor the beginner,"I read this book on a whim and was surprised at how easily it was understood. The complicated concepts were explained so that anyone could understand them. This book takes a light and accurate approach to a subject full of misconceptions and apprehension for most people. I would recommend this book to anyone nominally interested in astronomy and science fiction, or for anyone who has never seen a satellite in orbit from earth (many are visible to the naked eye). Tom Logsdon writes clearly and intelligently making this subject accessible for most people."
5,Wish more books were like this,"This is one of the most clearly written, easy to understand books I have ever read! Tom Logsdon is a gifted writer. There are hundreds, if not thousands of people knowledgeable enough to write a book on orbital mechanics. But only a handful can explain the subject with such clarity. And fewer still can write in the interesting fashion that Logsdon went for."
3,"Does the Job, but worth it to buy better CD player","This CD player does the job, and is good for its price, but it lacks some features that i miss with my old CD player. For example, when you stop a song, instead of picking up right where you left off it goes to the beggining of that song. This can be a pain if you have a book on CD or a stand up comedy recording, since they are in one long stream (at least mine are). Anyway, it does the basic job well and I can't really complain about performance or quality. But if you can spend and extra ten or twenty bucks, i recomend you do so."
4,Nice CD Player,This cd player isn't flimsy. I dropped it a couple of times already and it still is fine. The headphones are OK but i wouldn't suggest using them. The CD player only has basic necessities in a CD player and no extras. Anti-skip on this is way better than my old CD player though. It's a good player for the price.
1,Horrible,"Recently while I was on a bus trip, I found that if player was not sitting on a completely flat surface, a clicking sound was evident as if the disc was brushing up against the side of the player. This only got worse, and the clicking got louder at all times, until I finally decided to cut my losses and rip the top cover off. I then proceeded to give it an Office Space-like beating, punishing the player for months of torture. I urge you to not consider purchasing such a horrendous item. Hope this helps."
2,"cheap, but sound is not good","If you just need the cheapest ""brand name"" player, this one is ok, but the sound quality is not very good, it sounds as if you are listening to the mono recording;o)Spend a few bucks more and get something with good sound."
3,Standard Issue Stuff,"It comes with crummy headphones, and the control buttons are a little too sensitive. Otherwise, for the price, this is a decent player. The sound is fine and it's fairly free of skipping. I have not found it to be so delicate though. I've knocked it around a bit over the year or so that I've owned it and nothing's gone wrong. It's okay for the price."
5,One of the best,I used this player every day in muni transit to school. I found it much better than most of the CD players that I have (some of them are really expensive). It has really good anti-skip system. Sound is very good. I like it.
5,Wow! Surprisingly good!,"I am not sure if the one that they sent me was an exception or not, it's really really great! It's comparable to the Sony D-SJ15 Sports that I had. I like it very much!"
2,dont buy this..,plz shell out some more money n go for a good one..the sound quality is no whr close to a sony or other good ones...i bought it n i m truly pissed!!!!!
4,compares with current jazz quintets and sextets,"except for kryptonite, all of the pieces were written by wayne shorter, amazing when you consider how generous he was to his group here. tom thumb begins with a drum/bass duo that maintains control the entire piece.go has an asiatic flavor with flute and a strumming piano. schizophrenia, the title piece, is a concerto for drum. and miyako is another one of shorter's wonderful ballads. with all the great ballads he's written i don't know why other musicians don't play them.this album leaps ahead of its time and here in the 21st century sounds as good as, no, sounds better than just about any jazz quintet and sextet playing these days."
4,Tapestry of Sublime,"Well organized and meaningful. A sophisticated barrage of late night frenzy and atmosphere. Essential for those seeking ""A"" player entries into their library."
4,boy i love this record,"I've seen this band a few times and had to find the record. It sucked me in right from the beginning (probably one of the best record beginnings I've heard in a while). Some of the most impressive Chicago emo-rock available. Male/female vocals that just run perfectly alongside each other. Some track are beautiful and touching, and others make you wanna kick someone in the shin. These kids deserve a lot more than they get."
4,"Made me cry, made me scream","I guess for lack of a better phrase I would describe this album as ""Beautifully Violent"" One gets a good grasp of the male/female duality on this album..Kyle and Caithlin really have great chemistry together and this album proves it...If you dig love songs with heavy drumming and open tuning, then this album is for you."
4,...,"Its hard to make a good emo cd. Emo generally comes off as being a bunch of self obsessive, boring, melodramatic dribble from some highschool kid's diary. Though this is the case, Rainer Maria has somehow managed to make an album that is decidedly emo, and at the same time... good. I highly recommend you buy this one.To the reviewer who said Long Knives Drawn is Rainer Maria's only good cd: you are wrong. Long Knives drawn is (I'll try to be euphimistic here so that this actually gets posted) not Rainer Maria's best CD. It is in my opinion their worst CD. It is what I think of when I say the word emo, just with a little bit of a harder edge. Its just a part of the cliche. If you are a ""sensitive"" high school kid that is just really ""emotional"", go out and buy Long Knives Drawn. If you like music that doesn't suck, Past Worn Searching is for you."
3,"An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age. Okay not really.","Very good blade, arrived very sharp and holds an edge well. The flipper tang is nice and fit my medium sized hands well. The styling is very nice.Is a frame locking blade (not a personnal favorite), belt / pocket clip positions blade tip down, Thumb assist button seperated and fell off after a month (it is two pieces), found a really small machine screw and cap nut to replace.Overall I can not reccomend the blade, but perhaps some will like it better. You are better off spending the extra 20 - 40 bucks and get a better blade."
2,Not attractive...,"I bought this knife as I expected it to be attractive, but when I got it, it really wasn't a good looking knife at all. Plus, the black trim was already scratched up a little which made me realize how easy it would scratch and how much more unattractive it would become with use. I was disappointed with it."
2,Beautiful Illustrations...Bad Writing,The illustrations found within this book are beautiful and remind me of some early 20th century American artists. I am sorry to say that Madonna's writing is uninteresting and ...well...not childlike. Children love image and humor in word but Madonna's story is as dry as last weeks' Twinkie crumbs. A more clever choice of words and story line would go a long way in doing justice to this ancient morality tale. This book reads like a command from your Mom to do your homework...it just ain't fun.
5,Madonna Does It Again,"""Mr. Peabody's Apples"" is the second edition in Madonna's series of children's books, following her successful ""The English Roses"". As usual, she showcases her highly creative side, making her book unique. She incorporates a story from the Kaballah religion, making it her own. She places herself in the stories with her writing without physically being in the story. Such theme gives joy to more than just children. Many adults will love it as well. The storyline teaches a lifelong lesson that'll always be useful. Those who want to discover this lesson must read the book. Loren Long's painting for the illustration are beautiful. They give the book the added enjoyment. Everyone will be highly entertained while reading. ""Mr. Peabody's Apples"" will be a collector's item in the near future as it deserves. Look for the other three editions to her series to be released in the near future."
1,"Good, moralistic story but about the messenger ...",Nice story with good message. It's just that I am not so hip on this messenger. I don't at all associate her with materials suitable for children.
1,Saved by the artist,"Otherwise I wouldn't bother rating it at all. Im my opinion, another awkwardly-written story intended for children but falling wide of the mark.I don't think that even in the late 1940's, people visited a greengrocer to pre-pay for one apple then arrange to return later that day to pick it up. There was no explaining these bizarre actions (how could you??).An important messages to children wasted by a ridiculous plot twist. What will she come up with next."
5,"Yes, please, yes!","I know what you're thinking (I really do because I traded my soul for psychic powers), you're thinking, ""hey wait, can Madonna read?"" Surely if she could, she would have picked up one of her recent album reviews and glimpsed at the big words long enough to realize that she's lost whatever talent us soulless psychics thought she once had.But this is Madonna, ladies and gentlemen, and she can read and *write*. See for yourselves, I am totally not making this up."
4,Mr. Peabody's Apples,"Rumors can hurt is the theme of this wonderful children's story. Madonna who is not only a great singer, actress and performer is also a talented writer. The book Mr. Peabody's Apples tells a story about ahow hateful rumors can hurt someone. It is a great book when teaching a lesson on gossiping. Gary Dominicus"
4,gorgeous and good,"The art is fabulous, the lesson is a good one which teaches sensitivity to other people's feelings, and reading it to my 5 year old felt wholesome and right. I am cruising around the website right now looking for something like it to buy. Happy reading."
5,Apples and feathers teach a lesson in the power of words,"Mr. Peabody's Apples is the second of five children's books written by Madonna. The story is a retelling of a 300 year old classic from the Jewish tradition of Ukraine. Set in a small American town in the 1950s, it uses a misunderstanding and rumor to show the importance of a person's good name and the ease with which it can carelessly be destroyed.Mr. Peabody is a school teacher who is also the coach of the local little league team. One day a boy sees him take an apple from the green grocer without paying. How does the child react when he thinks this respected member of the community is a thief? How does Mr. Peabody clear his name? This is a tale that will appeal to the young at heart regardless of age.The book is beautifully illustrated in a Depression era style by Loren Long. Full page color illustrations alternate with pages of text that are boxed in with monochrome drawings. A sumptuous treat to the eye as well as the soul."
2,Madonna Needs to Learn How to Share,"I gave this book two stars for the beautiful illustrations by Loren Long. I think it's strange that the author who tries to write about themes of how to live a good life while treating people with respect, didn't insist that her publisher put Loren Long's name on the cover. Check out his other wonderful books."
5,Highly recommend,"I highly recommend this book, not only are the illustrations beautiful the story line is superb. I found this one to be much better than her first one, I would definitly give this book as a gift because it is a definite keeper to put on the shelves to enjoy for years to come."
3,Better than English Roses but that isn't saying much,"Madonna does know how to pick fine illustrators. I wish she was as good at writing. I've worked in a children's bookstore, know many booksellers and we all agree...she can't write.The story isn't so bad except that when Mr. Peabody takes the apple, the clerk is standing right there. It seems pretty obvious to the reader that the clerk knows he is taking an apple. So why the big surprise later on in the book?How many of these works is she going to spring on unsuspecting children?There are many other fine books - ask your independent book seller."
1,As if the First One Wasn't Bad Enough,"First things first: the artwork is beautiful.Second things second: Madonna is not the illustrator (and once again the illustrator's name is left off the cover even though he is more than half responsible for the finished picture book)Could Madonna's stories be any more heavy handed and moralistic? Yes, we get it, don't judge people. Good message. Will you stop writing books now? No? Well I guess the message will continue to be pounded into our heads with the hammer-of-obviousness-and-easily-predictable-endings through 2 more books. Even though the bruise of bad writing has barely healed. Sigh."
3,Stars for the Illustrator who is not mentioned on the cover!,"Shame on Madonna!!! The only reason this book has the feel that it does is because the illustrator has wonderful sensitivity and style and uses his talent to make a warm and terrific book to look at. And because of Madonna's gigantic ego, the illustrator's name is left off the cover,...one would conclude that Madonna would like the world to think that she created the whole feel of the book. Please give us all a break and give credit where credit is due! PUT THE ILLUSTRATOR's NAME ON THE COVER, you ego maniac!!!!! This Illustrator has a look that is reminisant of Thomas Hart Benton. That makes for a heartland look that is comfortable and warm. Not to mention a pleasure for the eye."
3,Not Original,"Madonna is so talented. Why should she take from the masters and rewrite a story? I think her heart is in the right place, but how easy can retelling a story be? I'd stick to the original storytellers and buy books such as, Lakas and the Manilatown Fish, Drum, Chavi, Drum!/Toca, Chavi, Toca! and anything by Sandra Cisneros. Your kids deserve the best!"
3,Mr. Peabody's Apples,I thought that the book was ok but not great. Within the whole she repeats the same frase about 5 or 6 times.Its also kind of misleading becauseit makes you think that the kid that adores Mr. Peabody is the main character. The highest score I would give this is a 3.
5,"5 Stars, 3 Apples, and 2 Oranges ...","On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this book 5 stars, 3 apples, and 2 oranges ... (sorry for mixing apples and oranges, ma, but I'm up to my knuckles in feathers here ... , how's about you???). This is such a wonderful book for kids like me ... (... how do you like dem apples??? ...). You tempt us so much with your imaginationings ... it's unbelievable! (Say hello to BS for me ...)"
2,"My God, this is a bad book","I give it two stars because the illustrations are really kind of nice -- but the writing makes one's teeth ache. Madonna is the sort of writer who thinks it's quaint and charming to have all her characters speak without contractions. Trite, boring and preachy. Skip it."
5,The power of language!,I am a communication/public speaking instructor and I am always trying to illustrate the power of words...this story nails it! The artwork is wondersful as well. I highly recommend this book.
2,Ma-snore-onna,"Hey Mommies and daddies! If you really want an excellent bed time story, read this! This story is guarenteed to put any child to sleep as fast as you can say LEMMONY SNICKETT. I am a kids librarian, and this even put me to sleep! I mean, this is a lot better than her English Roses disaster. I am not saying that she is a bad writer. This is an interesting version of an ancient fable, but she is too wordy. Children cannot comprhend (...), so what makes Madonna assume that they can understand her text? The illustration makes up for her story. Inspired by Norman Rockwell, and Edward Hopper artist Loren Long is a remarkable talent. The art work brings Madonna's characters to life and makes the reader feel as if they are in the midwest during 1949. I would like to see this illustrator publish her own art work in a book. It would make an excellent coffee table book."
2,Disappointing effort on Madonna's part,"I thumbed through this book at Target and to my dismay, I found my attention wandering to twinkling ornaments or to the cry of a forlorn child. The writing was dull and uninspiring leaving me bored and tired. The illustrations were nifty though, which dampened the overpowering reek of a celebrity attempting to generate more cash through pathetic endeavors. The moral of the story is an awesome one, yay for the fantastic lesson of how destructive gossip can be, but Madonna does a poor job of ""retelling"" the ancient lesson. I found this book was not worth the time spent leaning on a rickety stand at the store with odiferous people swarming about and so I do not recommend it unless you like to stare at illustrations for that is all there is, really, to praise in this book."
1,MORE TRASH FROM MADONNA,"Yikes,That Madonna is back with another vapid story about nothingness. This time the only difference is the artwork which is the only thing of any real value. Unfortunately, greedy Madonna (NOSFERATU) actually copyrighted the artwork from the artist for herself. This isn't suprising since that's the way she works...let's just appropriate everything."
1,Not worth your time,"It is amazing how someone whose values are exactly opposite to those in this book could write this. My 7 y/o triplets whom I homeschool have found much more worthy items to spend our time reading! We always look at the authors and their backgrounds and my children have viewed authors with a strong connection to the books they write. I have taught them that you cannot always judge a book by its cover, but that you can tell what is in a person's heart by what they say and do. Maybe Madonna is searching herself what is truly valuable in life...yet she'll still do things that SELL herself, while sheltering her own children from the smut she puports!"
2,Too explanatory...,"While Madonna has chosen a wonderful character trait to highlight in ""Mr. Peabody's Apples"", I believe that she tries to over-explain the moral of the story rather than giving the child a chance to think for himself.All in all, my five year old son (who devours books) was quite apathetic to the whole plot and found the writing to be too simplistic in relation to the bold and thought provoking illustrations rendered by the, obviously talented, Loren Long."
1,"Rumors yes, but what about...","I agree that this book is well written, however, the moral doesn't take into consideration when a child should tell an adult when they think they've seen something wrong happen. It wasn't the boy's fault that the town turned to gossip instead of investigating first. The message here could cause a child to think it is wrong to tell an adult when someone touches them inappropriately or hurts them or a real thief is stealing apples. So, while the prose is excellent in the end the moral leaves too much for the child to assume."
4,A Very Nice Book.,I was a bit leery about the story until the end but I liked the message. It is a fable about how people's words can hurt others. The art work is phenomenal and representative of Thomas Hart Benton's paintings.
3,Could have chosen better title,"Not reviewing the book, but pointing out that given Madonna's propensity for innuendo or explicitness (you know what I mean), she could have chosen a better title for a children's book than ""Mr. Peabody's Apples."" How about a simple change like ""Mr. Peabody and the Apples?"" Or was this a Madonna/Freudian slip?"
2,less than good condition,I was disappointed with this book. The corner is bent and the cardboard is broken. I would not say it is in good condition.
4,Beautiful Art,"Impressive quality. We bought it for the lesson in the story, not even realizing who the author is. Pretty neat book to have. The art is very nice. Wish there was a little more to read."
5,Excellent Read,I would recommend this book to any teacher or parent who wants students to learn a lesson on spreading rumors. It pictures are artfully completed and its tale is heartwarming.
3,For the more dedicated New Order fan,"Song Listing: 1.intro 2.Confusion 3.Blue Monday 4.Touched by the hand od dub 5.Spooky 6.1963 7.Young Offender 8.Fine Time 9. Everythings gone green 10.The Beach 11.Bizarre Love Triangle 12.Regret -Mostly music without words, but then again it's Trance is it not! Bizzare Love Triangle, Reget and Fine Time do have words, and is worth the price of the Cd alone!!! Finally good luck if you know any of the bands on this CD!"
2,superfluous and bland,A pointless tribute album is one in which not a single song merits comparison to the original. An album of remixes would have been more rewarding and appropriate.
1,Argh,"With its only saving grace being the covers as mentioned by others, Blue Order is otherwise nothing more than a very badly executed cash in on what there is of the 80's electro resurgence (not that said resurgence is a bad thing - far from it - but Blue Order is NOT doing it any justice). Cliche'd uninventiveness is the order of the day here - just like all these NuTrance collections going around. *ARGH*Do yourself a favour and make sure - instead - you grab The Best Of (blue ?), and The Rest Of New Order (pink ?). The latter especially, is a MUCH better collection - featuring as it does, 80 minutes of VERY good New Order mixes. Including such classics as Pump Panels' stomping acid mix of Confusion... Hardfloors' own floor-worrying acid techno mix of Blue Monday, and many other very memorable cuts.But Blue Order? No. Just... No."
1,THIS IS NOT A TRIBUTE BUT AN EMBARASSMENT,"Why on earth did they have to make a tribute like this to New Order? This is a mess! This is the poorest rendition of classic New Order songs. They made a terrible mess of Blue Monday and The Beach. The guys who did this tribute obliterated the theme and the groove of the music that made New Order the standard by which every modern techno music writers must aspire to be. The guys who did this tribute were definitely not from that generation. Too bad guys, maybe in the next life you might find yourself in the right generation when the sound was New Order and nothing else compared to it. Maybe then you'll realize what the sound of New Order is really all about. I'm giving it one star cuz it came in Cd format. That's about it. Dont buy this CD!"
1,Not Good,"I'm a big New Order fan and I'm generally open-minded to tributes, but I have to say this one really isn't worth buying, unless maybe you can find it used somewhere. As other reviewers have said, the tracks on here are very bland and completely uninteresting. They all sound the same! None of the covers here even comes close to matching the original. If you can, get Thieves Like Us instead. Its a limited edition, so it may be tough to find, but the tracks on there offer a much greater variety of sound and some of them even surpass the originals.This one...NOT recommended."
3,"Ok, so its not the best but...","Clearly none of the previous listeners have any appreciation for electronic music or are just your average american biggot. Ok so it's not upto New Order standards but there are still some very pleasurable versions on this cd and given the fact that alot were most likely produced on a very low budget or even bedroom produced, I think it still has something going for it. For the average cost of a penny I am embarrassed for the people who dare even write negatives."
3,M'eh...,"Well, I don't mind any of the tracks, but compared to the originals, they're not that great. The one acception is Spooky. I just like this cover. And Regret. But other than that, not worth the price. I own it only because I'm a die-hard fan."
3,IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"Mainly Music (no words). I like the cover versions of Regret and Bizarre Love Triangle. I have to agree with the other reviewers, This two covers are worth having."
3,"Must-have for New Order Fanatics, OK otherwise","The version of 'Regret' is the best that I've ever heard, great BLT, a couple of others are worth having."
3,"Interesting and not bad, worse than ""Rest of..."" though","Interesting for fans, but weaker than ""Rest of..."" and the newer Blue Monday mixes, making this CD somewhat irrelevant, though not bad."
2,There are better options for your money,"I received this product free with the purchase of 15 oil filters for my car. Bottom line it works.Overall the product does what it says, but it is clumsy, slow, messy, and small.The unit doesn't hold more and 6 quarts of oil, which doesn't help me with my truck, and can get messy when you try to move the oil out of this container. The product doesn't have some of the minor details which would greatly improve its over all function, such as a lip to prevent oil drip, or a stable handle used when you're pumping/vacuuming the air out.I would recommend the Mityvac product line, their design not only does the job but makes oil transfer easy.So unless you get this product for free there are other products which can do the job better for the same price."
5,Worked for my transmission fluid change in my vintage car,Worked as advertised. The vaccuum could have been a bit more efficient. It seemed like I had to pump a lot.
1,NFG,They were very nice.....they sent me two of them. Unfortunately....neither one worked. I wound up buying something else.
3,For almost free they're worth it but just barely,"The sound is good but occasionally distorted. I think it comes down to your tolerance for bad sound, keeping in mind that the sound quality will be with you long after the savings has worn off. (It has outstanding sound for a $2 speaker and that doesn't mean it's particularly pleasant to listen to.)If you plan on traveling with portable speakers and want to minimize bulk, keep the cost reasonable, and have a somewhat better listening experience consider this:iLuv iSP100BLK Mini Portable Speaker for MP3 Players and iPod (Black). It's more compact, more durable, and has considerably better sound.To put it in perspective, I'm on a business trip and was given one of these (the INSTEN) as a ""thank you"" for filling out a survey. I've decided it's worth tossing it in my suitcase for the trip home... but just barely. However, the next time I travel and want to take along a portable speaker it won't be this one."
2,Not so hot,"While they are easy to use and very compact, I'm not very impressed with these speakers. They are not efficient and are quite wasteful on batteries (compared to other portables I own). I'm glad I use rechargeable batteries, otherwise this thing would cost a fortune to operate.I will agree that they are very handy as a portable speaker for travel. I have several different docking stations for my MP3 players, but they are not very portable. Just don't expect much bass response from these tiny speakers. Their tonal quality leaves a lot to be desired, even for a neophyte audiophile.I've switched to a larger, but still portable, speaker system with true docking capability, and great bass sound.On the upside, they would make a cheap stocking stuffer for kids for Christmas."
5,works great,No problems so far works great arrived in a very timely matter work well on my net book also you can also plug it into your phone for nice clear music
1,One Speaker Broken,"For a few bucks I can't expect much, but with one speaker working and the other not, this particular product isn't worth the shipping it took to get it here."
4,Worth the money!,"I got my speakers in the mail yesterday. Though one thing I didn't like was the fact that it said it was an INSTEN Speakers, and when I opened mine it said it was a GT Max. So mine did not come with the logo in the front. But despite that so far the speakers work well. But I haven't put batteries in and have not checked the battery life. I plugged the USB cord into my computer to try the speakers out. And To be honest it gave off great quality sound! I'll try it with batteries and see how the sound is, but so far I like it. Worth the money only 5 bucks."
4,Awesome Little Speakers,I'm very happy with these speakers. The folding design is great for portability. The sound quality is excellent at the price and for this size. The only drawback is my 2nd generation ipod nano swims in the large holder. It's not a snug fit like the player in the picture.
1,I would not buy or suggest to buy,"I was just looking for something small to provide background noise (not even tolerable music) that I could carry to the beach and not be concerned about destroying it. But, this thing didn't even meet my very low expectations. This thing is not work the cost even if the shipping is free. One of the speakers doesn't work at all. To get it to turn on, you have to wiggle the switch to just the right spot. The sound quality is awful.The only positive thing is the size."
1,Sucks,I Received this speaker on time and was anxious to hear it because of some of the reviews that I read on Amazon. Out of the box it was not the same speaker pictured on the Amazon web site. Pluged the speaker into my I Touch 4g and the sound was actually good. It played for a few secounds and then died. I would not recomend these speakers
3,Cheap but fine,"I use these speakers to listen to my iPod in my office. The speakers don't have very good sound quality, but that's not a big deal, since I have them turned down pretty low. They're very cheap in both cost and quality. Overall, though, I find that they were worth what I paid for them."
4,not bad,"It isn't much for high quality loud sound, but the wife loves it cause it's small and portable and can plug her phone into it and have decent sound. Therefore I love it too."
3,Lasted about 3 months,Used these speakers exclusively with an A/C adapter. About a week before its third month aniversary the plug receiver in these speakers became loose and will not stay connected to the power cord. Other than that I am very satisfied. I have ordered another and will update this review later.
4,Great for Price But Delicate,"The speakers are quite the value. I got them for a vacation where I planned to roadtrip around a foreign country. They were PERFECT for the car as well as for the time spent in hotels. The sound quality is pretty good, I didn't experience that annoying tin sound or echoes, or fuzziness. The speakers package in a nice compact size. The only ""but"" is that they're fairly. On the flight home, I threw them in my checked luggage, which was not a smart move considering how the airport workers toss around peoples' bags. Upon my return home, the speakers were ruined. But now i know, just take them on your carry-on luggage so they don't get all banged up."
3,Handy,These speakers deliver fair sound and are very portable and can be hooked to just about any mp3 player. That said I am afraid it is not all good. They are made out of cheap plastic wich is what you would expect for the price but are also cheaply made. When I got mine it was missing a screw wich I found out only after I had to unscrew it to glue the speaker back into place after it fell into the speaker housing (I had not even used it at that point). However it was also very easy to fix.For the money and convinience I would get it but deffintaly not for quality.
4,They were 9 bucks!,"I bought a $800 car recently, with no soundsystem. I slapped these on the dash with some velcro, hooked up my ipod & I'm set! The sound quality is pretty great (for $9) & it's reasonably loud. The batteries have yet to go out & I got a cig lighter/charger for $3. I'm set!...I think they would be great at a desk as well."
3,Instructions?,"This product is easy to use once you figure it out, but it would have been helpful to have SOME kind of literature with the item. I had to go on line to see how the thing works, where the batteries go etc."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"These little speakers do work once you figure out how to get them set up. The sound isn't bad but isn't great quality either. Although the speakers are pictured with the ipod sitting in them, it is not possible for me to set mine up that way. I have an IPod Nano and I have to leave it laying off to the side since I can't hook it up together. Since I only paid about $3 for them, I wasn't too horribly disappointed. I used them once or twice and then I went and purchased a clock-radio that is made specifically for using with an IPod. That cost about $50 and isn't portable, like these little speakers are. They do work and they are portable but it's a good idea to remember that you get what you pay for. If something is nearly free, there is a reason for that. :)"
5,Good item,"When I saw the price I figured this had to be a pretty bad item, so I looked at the reviews and they were mostly positive, well I see why. It's a pretty decent item at a great price. Easy to put together and the sound quality is good as well. I usually use it at work and it's nice to have around. The battery life is okay too, about 12 hours until I have to change them usually, maybe a bit longer. I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,Works great for a small product!,"Works great for a small product! Sound is loud enough to be heard in two plus rooms. Can be used with batteries or an adapter or through a computer. Very convenient and, of course, portable. Given as a stocking stuffer - recipient quite happy."
4,For the money? UNBEATABLE!,"Really good sound quality for the price. Just what the doctor ordered for those times you just don't want those earbuds stuck in your head. They ain't Carnegie Hall, but they're far less money, too - and not bad sound. Excellent value for the money. Highly recommended! (I bought 7 of them!)"
2,crappy but good for price,"I recently bought these folding speakers and since i had a pair of these previously, that i bought from target, i thought they were going to be the same. sadly these arent what i was expecting at all. There is no other way to explain this but if you want a good pair of speakers, spend more money.If you want a pair that sound terrible, crackle, and go out in the first week go ahead and buy these. i cant say anything else but you get what you pay for."
3,Great except the static,"They system looks great, but most of the time when I plug it in there is static. It occasionally cuts out and is great sound without the static, but that is not the norm."
1,CRAP,"EDIT: Hunk of garbage - not worth the $5.00 After about three weeks they just stopped working, not to mention the two weeks leading up to that the volume went bad on it, and to achieve a sound greater than stock laptop speakers, you had to put the volume up to the max which in turn created a crackled sound. Also the cord is so short you cant even position them in front of the laptop."
3,OK but disappointed,"These speakers sound OK for the price, the ONLY problem I have is that the power is not getting to them from the batteries. Works fine in USB power, but the portability of taking these along is hampered by the Battery issue.Enough to knock my rating from a 5 to a 3."
1,Dissapoint !!!,"First of all .. the one that the seller send me ... don't have any brand, no on the speaker and the box.. the sound was poor .. it sound like chicharra with any EQ... tested on my samsung GT-S5620 MONTE CRISTO.. and my i pod ... i don't know if ISTEN sound different .. but the one that the seller send me ... TOTALLY SUCKS ...AFTER THAT YOU BUY THIS .. ASK THE SELLER IF ISTEN ..."
1,Just as bad a you think it will be,"Yep, the quality is just as poor as you are afraid it will be. Ipod touch does not fit properly in the dock.Don't make my mistake, just go ahead and spring for a player that works."
1,Built Cheap and Sound Cheap,"Battery life abysmal, for 7 dollars i could have bought something worhwhile from a dollar store. don't wast your money on this product. does not come with a wall adapter so you are forced to use batteries."
3,"works ok, arrived broken","I ordered these because they were inexpensive, and I needed em quick for a road trip. They just arrived, and the little silver speakers were rattling around inside their plastic boxes. The sparse dabs of silicone sealer weren't sufficient to keep them in place, at least not through normal US Postal handling.So, if you're me, that's not really a big deal. A few minutes with a jeweler's screwdriver and a hot glue gun put things right, just fine.They come with a USB-->dc power plug, so they're nice for portable laptop use. The sound is tinny, but hey, for $9, that's AOK!"
3,You get what you pay for...,"These little speakers give big sound and the price is right, but... the quality in workmanship is definately lacking! The first pair I ordered had loud static & crackling in one speaker. The vendor immediately contacted me and sent a FREE replacement. The second pair had a slight hiss in one speaker, not perfect, but acceptable! don't expect perfection when you're paying bargain basement!"
4,Good inexpensive choice,"Arrived quickly. The build is uninspiring, but for the price it's a great choice. Sound quality is on a par with notebook computer speakers. Battery operation means it's truly portable. I use it to play audio to clients from my Ipod Touch, and it's nice and compact. Loud enough for everyone to hear and small enough I can put it in by briefcase. Wouldn't want to listen very long for pleasure, but that's what headphones are for."
3,OK,There ok. design is not the best. I like the little orange ones from meritline with the built in battery much more.
3,Review of INSTEN Folding Stereo Speaker - Black,"One of the speakers started to make a hissing noise within 1 week, but we still use it. Good for casual use."
3,cheap price for OK quality,"Poor quality sound not much better than laptop speakers. Not bad for the price, small and compact when folded"
3,"Ok speakers, not for party as described by others","These are OK speakers; I shouldn't have had such high expectations but did, based on reviews I read, which said you could use these for a small party. I don't know about that, but they are compact and play music with my 30gb zune. Also, the seller vortexcable shipped FAST, so I would order from them. They don't come with a wall adapter but $10 is a good price for these, I guess."
1,useless,"This is useless. The plug didn't fit my ipod classic, iphone or ipod touch. Plus, the none of the devices fit in the crevice and it's pretty cheap. Don't waste your time."
4,Very good and portable BUT,Its a very good little speaker you put in batterys and you can plug in your i pod touch or you can plug in to a pc to listen to music from you computer but if you have a mac its cool to plug the speakers into your computer instead of batterys and then plug you ipod. see the only reason you would do that if you didint have triple a batterys and you had songs on your ipod that you dont on your computer.(what i mean is not the computer you sync on) The only problem is that when you try to go really high on them it turns to terrible quality but its a good buy for such a great price
4,amazing value,"These speakers are cheap, and the quality shows. However you don't buy speakers, let alone ones for $1.50 for their looks, you buy it for their sound, and these deliver. They are much louder than my laptop speakers and sound clear. I bought them as a cheap way to play music at the pool and they work just fine for that. Buy these expecting cheap plastic, but great sound. And other reviewers stated they came shipped in cheap plastic, mine was shipped in a small cardboard box and arrived in perfect shape. For roughly $5 with shipping included you can't go wrong. I do recommend some rechargeable AAA batteries if you plan on using this a lot."
5,INSTEN Folding Stereo Speaker- Black,This is great and I recommend this. I wish I had ordered 2 of them
2,"It's only good for sitting on your desk and listening to at really, really low volume...","First off, don't expect to jam to any tunes to this. This is content to play something like Simply Red and a very low volume. Secondly, the cord it comes with is very short. Barely long enough to plug into the headphone jack of your MP3 player. The USB cable is pretty short also. I had to sit the speakers on top of the computer just for it to reach. I will not buy again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,A small portable with a small sound,"Disclosure: I paid less for these speakers than a pack of cigarettes would cost. So, I didn't expect a lot.The Good: The speakers fold up into a very compact cube which protects everything and fits easily into a suitcase, attache, or backpack. Battery life appears acceptable. The fidelity is reasonable. And it has an on/off volume control and LED power lite.The Bad: The sound volume is, simply stated, puny. These speakers are usable in a quiet room, at your work desk, or on your night table. But they won't fill a room with sound. For me, it's a toss-up as to wether or not I would just stick with headphones.Others have mentioned the very short input cable. It's just long enough to plug into your iPod when it is in the cradle. But, for stowage, it winds around the case and everything fits snugly.Because of the limited volume, these speakers will find limited usage in your travels."
3,decent sound,it does enough to cover up all the noise my next door neighbors make. why must they hammer nails into their bed posts at 2 am? i do not know
1,crap,"yes it hooks up okay, yes it works fine with batteries, but my problem is volume even at full volume i cant hear anything from three feet away and thats just crap to me."
1,Don't,"Well, some of the reviews said this was a great little speaker system, others said it a piece of junk. For 6 bucks and free shipping I figured ""What the heck"" and ordered it. When the first notes of ""Help"" came out of the speakers it was abundantly clear that those in the ""piece of junk"" camp were dead on. Don't bother with this item. If you have any recommendations for a cheap, small speaker set to hook up to my MP3 player so I can jam in the shower, I'd love to hear them."
3,They're ok.,"I bought these for work, to listen to my ipod. The sound quality is great, but I had to replace the batteries every week. I ended up throwing them away because at one point the batteries leaked and it was a mess. I do not recommend these only because of the use of batteries. Other than that, they're ok speakers."
2,the tone quality is so so,"The volume of sound is OK, but the tone quality isn't OK. I kept it because its cheap price."
3,"These cheap speakers are easy to take apart, and good for projects.","I disasembled these in about two minutes and used them for cheap replaceable speakers in a wooden ipod case I was building. They worked fine for the money, but if looking for a long term product, look elseware."
2,You get what you pay for,"This product fits 'you get what you pay for'. It is a real cheap product with lot of static when attempted to connect to iPhone. Don't even attempt to connect to Android, it didn't work for me.The sound quality is okay but the loudness is just about one volume higher than the regular volume on iPhone so it did not serve the purpose of speaker at all. This product has 2 stars only for the speedy deliver and customer service otherwise it's definitely a '0' star"
5,Exactly as advertised,"While this is not exactly the highest quality speaker, it is exactly as advertised, exactly what I was looking for, and an unbelievable deal (the cheapest ones I could find before I bought this were literally 10 times as expensive. Good quality, and came when I was told it would come. Would definitely do business with this company again."
5,Wow!,I was not impressed w/ these small speakers till I plugged them to my computers USB port! talk about a bargain!
2,Stylish but lacks in quality,"I decided to buy this based off the reviews that I read. When I recieved the package I was excited until I opened it up. The speakers are stylish looking, but lack quality in the plastic that they are made up. The foam around the speakers that allow movement is just really bad quality foam. When I plugged in my iPod and turned it on, the speakers blew in less than 10 min of using it.I wasn't disappointed because it twas only ten bucks. However, my suggestion is not buy this. The speakers do not dock into the iPod but plug in through the headphone jack. On mine, it distorted if the sound on my iPod was turned up more then 3/4 way and if it was below it was too low to hear.Instead, do yourself a favor and get either some Sonys that cost a little more or spend a lot more and get some good quality speakers."
4,Good Cheap Portable Speaker,"These are good cheap little speakers. Plug n' play - easy set up. Works with my (non-Ipod) MP3 player just fine. They sound a little tinny and cheap, but I expected that at such an absurdly low price, these are for convenience and portability, not high fidelity. These speakers excel for SPOKEN audio, like audio books and lectures, where quality is not such an issue. As long as you're aware of that, then you'll get a great little bargain."
1,Cherry Print Thigh Hi's,"Absolute crap. I am only a small size, but the paint on the stockings stretches and looks cheap. The elastic at the top of the stockings is way too tight (Im only a small size) and makes your thigh bulge and look fat. And it still falls down despite the elastic. Dont buy this, they are not even worth the few dollars I spent."
3,Samsonite Wallet,"This wallet is ok, the plastic slide piece was not installed correctly, but it serves the perpose in which I purchased it."
2,I liked the pictures,"I could just ditto all the stuff that guy from New Mexico wrote. I had the same experience with trying to work out the problems at the end of the chapters. It's almost like we had the same class or something. Weird. Anyway there was some good stuff in the book, especially all those block diagrams. The authors are from the left coast, so if you are used to A,B,C, and D in your control block diagrams the F,G,H, and J could throw you off. Happy reading."
1,painful memories,"we used this book in an undergraduate control course. As another reviewer wrote, the problems following a chapter had nothing to do with the material preceding it. It was as if the problems were done by a person other than the authors. This subject is hard enough even with a good book, but the disconnect between chapters and problems made this interesting subject unenjoyable for me. I still remember working with classmates trying to get through our homework assignments, staying up past 3a.m. hoping to get a few hours sleep before having to start all over again with a new horrid batch of homework problems from this evil book."
3,Not Bad,"This book wasn't bad. We used it for an intro to controls class. If the Prof is good, this is a useful book. The link with Matlab is strong and this is important becuase most design seems to be done with Matlab these days."
2,No solutions to the problems,How can it work if there is no solutions to the problems? Is there a solution book I have to buy separately?
2,Kindle Version is Lacking,"The book itself seems OK. Don't get the Kindle version though. It is full of formatting problems and typos that make the math very difficult to follow. For example theta shows up as a 0 numerous times, the dots denoting time derivatives are occasionally missing, and on a few occasions expressions are just plain missing (ie it will say ""theta="" and nothing will follow. The Kindle version definitely needs some love from Amazon to make it at all usable."
2,Awful book,"I'm a graduate electical engineering student and this is one of the worst books I've had to use. It's simply poorly written.Get ""Feedback Systems"" by Astrom and Murray instead."
2,Unnecessarily Cryptic,"The Good:This text does hit on most of the topics in controls. It's manageable if you have a good instructor.Wide breadth.The Bad:The writing seems to go out of its way to be unnecessarily cryptic. It performs variable changes every chance it gets, skips steps in the examples (which are light in and of themselves). The figures in the last sections link back to the first. If you find yourself saddled with a hard-to-understand instructor (foreign-language Ph.D students come to mind), get the exercises from someone else and pick up Ogata's Modern Control Engineering (I literally understood Root-Locus more from twenty minutes of reading Ogata than two hours of wrestling with this text).Poor depth. Avoid.A note: You WILL require MATLAB. Don't try this material without it."
3,Pros and Cons,"The writing is mediocre. It misses on mechanical-electrical analysis analogs, such as the mathematical ""equality"" between the analysis of springs and inductors.The Appendix includes useful reviews of complex calculus, but it does NOT have answer sets."
3,Good,"The book is very good for individual study because of its step-by-step approach. However, it is difficult to use for classroom instruction. By teh way, there is an excellent Solutions Manual available from the publisher, which I would recommend for instructors.It uses MATLAB extensively. ISBN 0-201-59937-6,Addsion Wesley 1994."
1,"Bad, Unclear, & Boring",I was required to buy this book for a mechanical engineering class. It is not clear in the way that it presents the subject matter. The writing is boring and bad.
2,Beware of the International Version,"Beware of the International Version it is not the exact same as the Hardcover version just with a softcover. There are less problems, and problems are numbered differently. Those are the only differences found so far, as of two weeks into the semester of an advanced controls course."
4,Great Book,This book was exactly what the class required and was very helpful in learning the material. More so than the professor.
1,the condition of the book was horrible,the condition of the book was horrible ... i paid 77$ for that book .. other online book stores had better deals but i thought its amazon ... i will try and never buy anything from this place...
2,grit is an acquired taste,"Laskin may be known more for his guitar-making skills than as a multi-talented singer/songwriter with a sharp edge for wicked parody and social commentary. But for those true folk fans who love to experiment, this 2 CD compilation pulls together Laskin's first two slabs of vinyl for Fogarty's Cove -Unmasked and Lila's Jig. While it's packed with gritty - and sly dark-humoured -hippie cottage singalongs that roam between traditional themes of the sea and the luckless and prickly observations of modern life, Unabashedly Folk is exactly that - 26 tracks of Laskin's blatant, unapologetic, in-your-face folk style which even at it's best remains an acquired taste."
4,A fascinating case,"I liked ""The Search for Grace"" because it did not try to spend a lot of time philosophizing, but simply presented the facts as they were. The author's goal wasn't to solve the mysteries of life, but to present a case of reincarnation where the past-life details could actually be verified. In that, he succeeded.Also interesting was the repeated pattern of Grace's previous incarnations, where the same souls re-played the same roles many times. This is in sharp contrast to the popular misconception that we supposedly ""flip-flop"" back and forth between victim and oppressor roles. The case of Grace suggests that this is not the case. Instead, we often repeat what is familiar to us."
3,I don't understand,"The book is well-written and I quite enjoyed it -- I read it in two days so it is also easy reading. However, there was one area I think the author needed to explain a little better because I did not understand it. How can a person live two lives in the same time period as this person reveals under hypnosis? He had an explanation that involved quantum physics but I'm much afraid that his explanation went zooming over my head like a fighter jet bound for Afghanistan."
3,Interesting but not well written,"The Search for Grace is an interesting book for anyone interested in reincarnation. However, there isn't much information about reincarnation and life in general and the writing is poor with a lack of chemistry between the hypnosis subject and her therapist."
2,Grace not loveless,"I am a direct relation to Grace Loveless Doze and I wasoffended by the book, as was many members of our familyincluding her son, Clifford who is now 80 years old.This book portrays Grace out to be a fluzy and she was not.Just an unhappily married woman.This book has brought disgrace to our family and a lot ofheartache to Grace's son.Grace was a lovely person and well liked by the Doze family.Her mother, husband, son and relatives loved her and werehorrified by her murder which is still unsolved today.Our family feels Dr. Goldberg is profitting money off of ourfamily's tragedy."
5,My son loves it!,"My son loves his new chess board. He has taught me to play chess with it. He practices everyday on his own for his school's chess team. The board has been very inspiring and helps his to stay calm and concentrate on something for long time, which we know growing boys have a hard time to do. :)"
5,In preparation for take off.,Strap yourselves in folks this puppy smokes.If I could only take one album with me when I leave this world this would be it by a long shot.The Dr and this band have really set the bar here and from all the music I have listened to over my long life it has never ever really been challenged in my opinion.The Dr's workin the clinic of funk.
4,Top Quality Funk,"Do you like funk? Do you like Hammond organ? Then check this album out. Even though Lonnie Smith is not the best singer around, he's got a superb band with him, and he's a tremendous organist. Not as flashy as Jimmy Smith or Jimmy McGriff, but with an excellent taste and sense of the groove. Here he is at ease with a brilliant George Benson on guitar (don't worry, Benson does not sing romantic ballads in the album -thank God)... Get the funk going!"
3,Great book for a tourist.,"It is a good book tracing a part of Anand's life as the Indian top celebrity. But if one wants to know more of Anand the great player:Vishy Anand ""My Best Games of Chess"" is recomended"
1,I don't get the other reviews,"I bought this clock because I sorted on best avg customer review. I don't know why the high reviews - the shortcomings of the clock are in the reviews. Setting via the atomic clock did not work at all (one of the other reviews noted the same but said its ok because they set the clock 5 minutes ahead). As another reviewer noted - the clock drifted - yup. Another wrote the alarm was not loud. I think that summed up my experience; the clock does not set, its not accurate, and the alarm is not good. I bought it to be a self setting accurate alarm clock that would wake me up. I will add a new comment, the clock looks like it is straight out of the Jetsons, and its big, that might be attractive to you, but to me it was scary. I am glad Amazon has a great return policy."
1,Doesn't work at ALL and isn't as shown!,"First, the clock doesn't have the nice black face with lit up digits, it has a BIG blue screen blasting right in your face, with black digits. Second, mine didn't work at all, completely DOA! It shows all the digits, turns to garble then goes completely blank. Its then my responsibility to not only send the POS to the manufacturer, but I have to include a check for return postage! Cheap construction. Can't tell what the crescendo alarm is, as it doesn't work!"
3,Good but Short,"Ordered this movie for my child, was disappointed by how short it was. Nothing special about it, might as well watch the show."
2,A tourist trap just like the actual site.,I bought this book thinking it would be an examination of the architecture and story behind the House on the Rock. Instead it is a self-flattering description of the ticky-tacky tourist trap that the site has become. Buy it for curiosity to witness how much junk can be crammed in to entertain gullible day trippers from the Midwest. But don't buy it if you expect to learn anything from an architectural perspective.
5,Great value,I bought this for my 5-year old grandson for Christmas and it has been a real hit! He loves the built-in games and the battery life has been really great. I highly recommend this product.
4,A great toy!!!,"I bought this for my sons 5th birthday. He is the youngest of 3 and has grown up watching my older kids watch movies and play video games. This is something just for him. It took him about 3 days to figure out how it works. Now he can watch his DVD's and play the preloaded games. Most of the games are a big challenge for him but I know in time he will figure it out!!!!!!!I think that is what keeps it interesting for him. Anyway, I am so glad I bought it and so is he. Good purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I bought 3 for kids presents and have had to return 2!,"Two of the three have already broken, and my kids don't play rough with them. I returned one and am waiting for it to be returned, and now need to return another for another problem and I can't even reach them. The one time I got through to their customer service I was on hold for 20 minutes!"
5,Grab it and go!!!,"It does everything and best of all comes with everything...all the electronic adapters included, headset, remote, case. There are no game cartridges to buy or carry. It's all inclusive. My 9 year old daughter can move from one acitivity to another with ease. She loves it as much as I do!!!"
2,"Feature loaded, poor quality","Bought two of these at the same time. I loved the features, and they work for a short time. Even plays DIVX files, so I can put lots of TV shows, from my TiVO, and copies of legally unprotected DVD's (home videos) on a single DVD.Sadly, the charging equipment is low quality. Both car chargers broke on the first use. Out of the box one of them would not charge the battery. On the 11th use of one of them DVD's at no longer recognized.If the quality was there, this would be a perfect portable player. There really isn't any competition in the area, so there are no alternatives.I've owned these for a year."
2,michelle5324,I could never get the battery to charge to last more than 10 min. Had to keep it plugged in to watch.
1,Stay Away from this GARBAGE!!!!!!,"When I first got this DVD player, it worked intermitly, the power would go off and on, didnt matter if the battery was in, or just pluged into the wall. Its been less than 3 months now, now the power will not stay on, it just flashed on and off, Amazon, and the seller West Coast Mall have both told me, its past the 30 days, too bad soo sad, go to the manufacturer, I called Coby, it will cost me $18.00, and now DVD player for my daughter for 2 monthis, now I get to hear her ask all day long, DVD player, DVD player, over and over again, lucky me, stay away from the Coby brand, and buy electronics from Target, as they have a 90 unliminted return policy, or Best Buy, this mistake will now cost me financaily and frustration from my litte on who cant understand why she doesnt have her DVD player, as we speak my husband has gone to go and purchase the Fisher Price DVD player, to save money we bought this one, but as you can see, it has now cost us double the price!!!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this item for my son for Christmas. The battery pack charged but never worked - neither did the remote. I've tried 4 times to reach them using the consumer support number in the instruction manual - have been on hold 20 minutes each time - and then get disconnected - I used the feature to leave my number for a call back and I'm still waiting for a call 2 weeks later! I've tried the email tech support option - will see if they respond to that. Should not be this difficult to reach their consumer support! And, the product should work as intended as well! Steer clear!"
2,Ignore the 5 star ratings!!!!!,I saw the five star ratings and bought this. At the most I would give this two stars. I was pissed off when I got this!!!!! Beware!!!!!!! This is weak!!!!!!!!
5,Classic Thrash,"This is not only the finest Whiplash album, but one of the greatest thrash albums ever. A true masterpiece."
5,I'm glad I can still buy this,"I've been using Sugar Twin since 1971 to make my sun ice tea, and recently my large chain grocery stores have stopped stocking it. I'm so used to my tea with Sugar Twin, so I'm thrilled to have found it on the Amazon site."
1,"not useable no refun, would not answer E mail",This product has gotten to hot or something a big hard rock in box. Not useable will never order again. Amazon would not return money.
3,SugarTwin,Was disappointed with product. The sugar is all clumped up - will not order this product again.
3,"Good, can be better for the price","It is good considering the price I paid for it. It can play WMAs as well. Thats the best part of the player. Chaning tracks and albums are easy. Headset is good.The worst thing about the player is the battery consumption. Citizen CD190 uses two AA fully charged batteries for almost whole day, but this one uses it in just about 4 hours. The other thing is it has no ID3 support, so its kind of difficult to find out which track you are listening to.Anyway, its good for its price tag."
1,not at all worth the price,"I bought this in November of last year. It worked perfectly at first, but three months after, it started skipping. I dropped it at one point, and the lid popped open and the cd went flying. I use the player on my commute on the bus to and from work, which lasts about an hour, and it ate its way through a set of AA's within two days. It also skips something terrible if held vertically, or bumped hard enough.I had another Panasonic with a 40-second skip protection, and that lasted me four years before it finally gave out. Too bad they don't make the model anymore, or I would have purchased another instead of this terrible player."
2,Lame MP3 player - can't fast forward within a track,"Sorry but it's not a true MP3 player if you cannot fast forward within tracks. So its not useful when listening to audio books and other spoken word training like learning a language, etc.Every MP3 player I've used had a least a limited ability to scan in the middle of MP3 tracks. What if you have a 30 minute MP3? With this player, if you stop it in the middle of the track, or eject the CD, you have to go all the way to the beginning. So it is very very lame.Sony also handles MP3s badly in that it scans through tracks very very slowly (tested in the Sony car consoles). But at least Sony can scan through tracks. Kenwood is best I've found so far, but have it only in my car. Wish they made portables.I would go with the Rio MP3 CD player.. because that at least should work better (am purchasing one today, so I will know for sure if it works better a bit later..)"
2,Nice if you don't like your music loud,I dunno about other people but I like my music loud...very loud. Now I understand the limitaions of a 3 volt CD player...but when max volume with a $30 pair of headphones is not louder than a lightly raised voice....crap. Also this thing just felt cheap when I held it in my hand...the cover would bearly pop up showing they didn't feel the need to even put in a thick enough spring. Volume is about oh...50 DB and a vaccum is at least 80 bd. I like hard rock and the only way to listen to it is loud.
2,Works great but...,"works but never gets loud enough, you can turn the volume up full blast and still barely hear it, especially in an airplane"
3,Good cd player!,"I got this cd player about 6 months ago, and it is great! My last cd player would skip if you just touched it but this will NEVER SKIP! Believe me, the second I put a cd in it, I shook it around trying to make it to skip, it never did. There are some things about this cd player that annoy me. First of all the headphones are oddly shaped and the wire is way too short(I just used my own), there is a fast forward and rewind on the clip thingy, but not on the actual cd player, which I found odd, and the buttons are kinda small, but it's not that big of a deal.Overall I think this cd player is very good.(((( Ironicaly 2 days after i wrote how durrable this cd player is, it fell to the ground and broke. So if you don't drop this cd player!))))"
4,Solid Deal,"You want something that sounds great, doesen't skip, and reads mp3 discs quickly...then this is a must buy. It may not win any awards for its design and colour, but it will deliver in its playing.You may want to pass on this if:1. you have the money to buy an iriver.2. you want all the bells and whistles like: ID3 tags, extreme voulme, a good pair of headphones and fast forwarding through songs.However if you dont care about the above mentioned, then definitely go with this one.Really cant beat the price!"
2,Panasonic is declining in quality,"The cd player not only feels flimsy and cheap, it is flimsy and cheap. This is coming from a 5 years panasonic owner. The player dropped about a foot off the ground from my coat pocket and the the cover went flying off with some other various pieces. To make matters worse, the cover does ot even close now because the locking mechanism is broken. My old panasonic is not only thinner, but its heavier and feels more solid. Everything else works fine, but the build quality is just awful!My old panasonic is not only thinner, but its heavier and feels more solid. The sl-sx420, however, is built to break."
3,"Good Player, Broke Way To Fast","I bought this cd player back in March. I really liked it, it had great features and long battery life. But then it just stopped playing mid-November. I had dropped it once or twice, but since it just suddenly stopped playing when it had been in my bag for weeks and the batteries were new made me suspicious."
3,cheap.. just like the price,"It's a good buy if you really want a cd player with mp3 capabilities for a low price. That's why I got it. However, there are three problems I have with this player. The first and biggest problem is with volume. There is no volume on this thing. If you were outside or riding public transit, max volume gets you nowhere- especially if you wanna listen to something on the quiet side. Volume alone is enough to make me want to return this thing.Problem two is that you can't fast forward or rewind on mp3 tracks. But that's something you coulda expected for fifty bucks.Problem 3 is that the design colors are nasty ugly. Metallic teal? I get embrassed because the trim is on the earphones. I always try to cover them up with a hood.For props.. can't beat the price. And the anti-shock system is rock solid. I'm still a panasonic devotee."
3,not bad mp3 player,this is a quite good mp3 player for a decent price; however you don't have id3 tags and so you have to search each title by its number.. annoying; the design of the unit is cool and I liked also the remote command;One mayor problem with the 420 is that you can't search within mp3 tracks; very very annoying; you always have to skip back or forth a whole song; this is not the case with normal cds.
3,It's Aiight,"This is a decent MP3 player for the price. The sound quality is pretty good (when I connect using a car kit or otherwise) but the headphones are (surprise surprise) total trash; when I'm riding the subway, I can barely hear the songs despite going to maximum volume. Also, if you have an MP3 CD with over a hundred songs, it's annoying to skip forward and backwards searching for a song since there are no ID tags. And this is just nit-picky on my part but the metallisized teal-colored plastic arc on the cover piece of the player unit isn't doing much for aesthetics..it just looks kinda cheesy.Don't get me wrong--for the price, it's a good deal and the sound quality is pretty good--it has a cool equalizer so you can play around with sound presentation. It's a good deal if you have a decent set of headphones and are willing to deal with lots of skipping back and forth on your MP3 CDs."
3,Skips when running; mediocre headphones,"This player has great sound quality and good features overall for the price, especially the benefit of playing MP3 files.However, it skips when I go running (if you are just walking or other normal uses, it is fine), so I am planning to return it.I also found the headphones wouldn't adjust to my head properly (I think the pair I usually wear will go much smaller), so I had ot use it with different headphones."
5,Excellent player,"I was hesitant to order this item due to the comments about the volume. I listen indoors so I can't comment on outside traffic, etc. But it is plenty loud for me. I like my music rather loud too. I'm very happy with it so far!"
5,Great!,This was my very first ballet class music CD as a teacher. I could not have made a better choice! It has something for everything you want to do in class. Every tempo you could ask for. Beautiful music that could be listened to just as a background CD as well. Love it!
2,Better Books Out There,"This book takes what many would consider a mid level drug dealer and the search for him across the world - hence the ""Marco Polo"" tag. Well the villain here is not that bad so it is hard to get excited about the chase. He is no choirboy to be sure, but he is not a Pablo Escobar either. The detail of the police tactics used is interesting. The disappointing thing to me was the detail of how disjointed law enforcement is in the western world, nobody wants to work with any other countries? The book is ok and you can probably guess what happens in the end. If you are interested in this type of story, Killing Pablo by Mark Bowden is far better and more up to date."
1,Wrong Slang Dictionary,"Saw ""Oxford"" and thought I was getting the real deal.This is not a good reference book. Constantly getting""no further information"" or ""see this or that."""
3,"Nice art, but the book could be a little bit bigger in dimension","SPECIFICS:Page Count: 128Number of images: 141Small images: 48Half page images: 0Full page images: 772-page spreads: 16BW images: 1TEXT:N/AART:7 images: 5 stars40 images: 4 stars86 images: 3 stars8 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 3,5 Stars"
1,"Great idea, poor execution","We had an older version of this toy and it worked for years. It eventually wore out and I was excited to see it available. Unfortunately this one does not work so well. The one lane is smooth and the car runs great, but the other lane bubbles and the car falls off halfway down the track. THis frustrates my children to no end. Am waiting to hear back from the seller to resolve issue, but so far they have not responded to my email."
1,Broke almost immediatly,"It is very hard to roll up the track, and not at all kid friendly. When my son rolled up the track the first time it got all bent up and would not go back correctly. After about 10 minutes of me fighting with it I got it in but I am scared to let him play with it again. If it was up to me and not my 6 year old it would already be in the trash."
2,Flimsy track makes ths more trouble than it's worth!,"My son loved the launching feature, and we liked the portability and easy clean up, but the track is so flimy that it was misshapen after 3 or 4 uses and kept flipping over unless weighted down (which makes one side useless!)"
2,ROLL-UP RACING TRACK,WASN'T AS GREAT AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. NOT ENOUGH ACTION FOR MY GRANDSONS AND TRACK EASILY BECAME ENTANGLED AFTER EACH USE.
4,Son's,"Last christmas a friend bought this for my [...] year old. Of all the toys from last holiday, this is one of the few still seeing action. It is a simple track, and the track is flimsy but it serves its purpose. The durability of the moving parts is solid, we havent had anything break- my son is not easy on toys. I usually dont like Hot Wheels track items because of durability issues, but this one has been tested and proven in my house. My son loves this track. I think its a great, durable, simple gift for a young boy."
3,Too fragile for a young boy,"My six year old son loved this toy but the track would not pull back out of the case after the second day of playing with it. Young children should be supervised when playing with this toy when they are ready to move it, rewind it or pull the track out."
4,Compact Storage,It is so nice to find a race track that is so easy to store. The kids love it too. Only problem is that the tracks are a little thin and can get bent or damaged easily. Ours came with a slight bend at the end causing one lane to be faster than the other. Kids still play with it for hours.
2,Advance Squash,Dissapointed but okay Expected a better Advance Squash DVD I thought there would be more information on training this game much advanced grills etc
3,SHD CD?????? I'll refrain from profanity,"Whatever you do, don't be taken in by this SHD CD nonsense about sounding better because the polycarbonate is more transparent. I thought we'd gotten past the times when people said things like laying down the information in gold made it sound ""warmer"", or that putting a green mark around the edge of the CD did the same.Suffice it to say that it is nonsense to say that the polycarbonate enhances digital transfer, unless there is something significantly wrong with your CD player. I make digital copies of CDs for my portable player, and my copy program references a checkbit sum of the material from an online database and tells me that I have made a 100%, bit for bit, perfect copy of the disc. And I don't own a single polycarbonate disc amongst the 1000 plus that I own.Amazon does a disservice to its customers by propagating this nonsense.And I am a customer. I don't appreciate it."
2,"Ain't worth it, even for Butterfly fans","The first five tracks are decent versions, but if you are interested it for a version of ""In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida"" that's two minutes longer, forget it. First off, it's a shade too fast. Then somewhere along the way, bassist Lee Dorman and guitarist Erik Brann get bored with the signature ostinato that made the song great in the first place. And if they'd based this album on a wider range of performances, or hadn't begrudged us an extra song, they could have ended with the ""Iron Butterfly Theme"". I saw them during the tour supporting the ""Ball"" release and they ended the show with that one by Brann putting his axe in the stand with the last note still sustaining as he walked offstage until the local DJ who acted as emcee came out and shut it off before msking his last announcement."
4,Hard Rockin' 60's,"If you are an Iron Butterfly fan, you have to hear this disc. This is the only live album ever released by this superb 60's band. All of the material is from their first 3 albums and truley rocks! Features another long version of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, complete with drum solo. This is a much better version than the studio album. Very improvised, and very live. Probably recorded during the Ball album tour although no dates are mentioned. Serious Butterfly fans will love it. Very good sound quality and crowd responses. Great price too!"
1,Don't waste your money on this version,"I bought this album specifically to get the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida mp3 long version. Unfortunately the live version is NOT nearly as good as the original on the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album (vinyl). The quality of the sound is poor, the audience noise is distracting, and the variations the band used here were not an improvement. I have just ordered the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album (remastered CD) in hopes the sound will be better and it will be the song I actually remember. (I played this for hours and hours for months on end when it came out and I was absolutely sober every time. If I still had a decent turntable, I would look for a good used original record.) So it has now cost me twice as much as just buying the CD in the first place. Once the CD arrives and I get a chance to listen to it, I will try to remember to update this review and tell you if that is a better option. My advice is to skip the ""Live"" album."
2,There is something wrong.,"IT IS A SHAME., ERIC,LEE,DOUG AND RON JUST COULD NOT PLAY WELL IN A GADDA DA VIDA I REMENBER THE ECHO EFFECTS FOR THE DRUMS THAT WAS USED IN THE STUDIO VERSION THAT WAS SUPERB, IN THIS LIVE VERSION THE DRUMS SOUND TOO SILLY, JUST COMPARE THE LIVE VERSION OF GRAND FUNK DRUM SOLO IN T.N.U.C. A BIG DIFFERENCE OR THE LIVES RECORDINGS OF U2 IN UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY SOUNDED EVEN BETTER THAN IN A STUDIO.AND THEY EVEN MISS THE LAST INSTRUMENTICAL PART OF THE SONG, BUT VIDA IN STUDIO SUPERB."

4,I.B. Live,"This album has an undeserved reputation for being one of the worst rock albums ever recorded. However nothing could be further from the truth. There's NOTHING wrong with this album at all. In fact, it's probably the only Iron Butterfly album where the organ isn't under-recorded. Most of the songs on the album are actually better than the studio versions. Filled with Fear for example has the most psychedelic guitar solo you'll ever want to hear. Regretably, however, the drum solo on In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida goes on a bit too long"
3,Iron Butterfly - 'Live' (Rhino),"For some unexplainable reason(s), I've never been able to much get into this live album. To anyone who's often taken a look at my reviews, I usually love live lp's. Oh, 'Live' isn't terrible,it just isn't 'great' either, as most other fans have noted that it's one of the best live albums from that era. Only two cuts here I even liked were ""Soul Experience"" and ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"". Too bad this disc didn't have ""The Iron Butterfly Theme"". Now, THAT might've made a huge difference. I guess we'll never know."
3,Fair,The product was good in that it brought back memories of the time but the quality of the recording was only fair.
1,Kenton's worst,"I'm a Kenton fan of many decades, and it steams me to see reviewers touting The City of Glass. It isn't jazz, it isn't classical music; indeed, it's barely music at all. Graettinger was, well, eccentric, and somehow Stan took him (and himself) seriously. The result is nonsense, as the musicians who had to play it admitted. From the 1940s through the 1970s, Stan Kenton wrote and played a lot of excellent jazz. It is silly to contend that the Graettinger opus or the Tex Ritter album were significant parts of that history. In fact, they were the least of all that Stan and his great bands did."
1,City Of Glass,"Owww. Everytime I listen to that music, my brain gets short-circuited. I don't know what Graettinger was thinking, but boy, was he in outer space.I used to try and play this for guests at my place, but they usually got this pained expression on their faces and then asked me to change it to something else, or just shut off the stereo.I'm sure Stan Kenton was very proud of this album, but I really didn't understand it. Graettinger may have a been a musical genious and ahead of his time, but it wasn't meant for any time period during this century."
5,way out!,It has been almost 50 yrs since I heard CITY OF GLASS. Time alone has not hurt this album any. It is as fresh and rewarding as its first release.
1,Levi's Life,"Those who are devoted to the life and works of Peter Levi will enjoy this book. It is primarily about his then newly-acquired step-family, his emotional life, and (very peripherally) about Greece. He has edited or written good reference works on Greece; this is not one of them. It is a source for his biographer."
3,if there ever was a bad DMB album....,"This would be it.For the most part, this album fell into the ""pop trap"". This is so unlike anything else I have ever heard by them. Glen Ballard took the band, stripped it of their finer elements (violin and sax) and added an electric guitar. Glen stated that this was to allow the band something to jam with later... I have yet to hear any of these songs really flow live, much less jam.Every time I see Dave pick up the electric at a show, I now cringe. Thank you, Mr. Ballard.I have tried to make myself like this album and I cannot. The only saving graces on this are ""Everyday"" which is based off of an old song, #36, When the World Ends, and the fact that it is DMB.... three stars would be generous if it were any other band."
4,New sound for Dave,"I loved the new CD ""Everyday"" by Dave Matthews Band. But then again i am a hard core fan and would love it if he came out with renditions of nursury school songs. The sound is unique and not the same old Dave. He has some new instruments and some of the songs take some time to get used to. I wouldnt reccomend this for a first time Dave listener but die hard fans should enjoy. Thanks"
2,everyday/noway,"I REALLY LIKE THE DAVE MATTHEWS BAND, BUT I WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED WITH EVERYDAY.I ONLY LISTENED TO FIVE TRACKS OF THE CD,I FOUND WHEN THE WORLD ENDS AND DREAMS OF OUR FATHERS SO SO.IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE WAS GOOD INTENT WITH THIS RELEASE BUT IT JUST DOES NOT REALLY DO TO MUCH FOR ME.THE DAVE MATTHEWS BANDS GREATEST EFFORT SO FAR IN MY OPPINON WAS THE CD CRASH AND THE BEST TRACK ON THAT CD WAS THE PROUDEST MONKEY."
3,Lack's that Dave Sound,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge DMB fan, but this album was made specifically for MTV fans. the band trashed the lillywhite sessions and released this album with a pop sound. If you enjoy the early dave, this is not for you."
3,not up to par.,"dave matthews band has always displayed sheer beauty and talent throughout their long lived carrer, but this CD is not up to their usual. i would recommend 'under the table and dreaming' crash or another of the older cds, or if youre looking for some recent dave, then go with 'busted stuff'."
5,Dave & Band Deserves Praise...and Glen Ballard too!!,"This is a great CD, although many Dave purists might disagree, I believe this is a wonderfully put together CD, my favorite song, ""If I Had It All"" is a great example of the masterful lyric/song combo ability this band has shown throughout the years. Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed. Glen Ballard once again shows why he is one of the top record producers in the business."
2,Where's Dave?,"I was really disappointed with this. This sounds nothing like Dave. I like their music because it sounds fresh and displays the great talent they possess. This has Dave on electric guitar and sounds way over produced. I hope the next one is back to normal and if not, well I'm still huge fan of the older stuff."
1,He did it alright,"As an avid Dave Matthews Band fan, I was thoroughly disappointed with their most recent release, ""Everyday."" This album falls below the par that the past albums had set. Anyone who is looking for a Dave Matthews Band should not buy this album, it may have the name of the band on the cover, but there is something else inside. With the addition of electric guitar and the removal of long melodious jams, this album is more Dave Matthews with backup instrumentals than the actual Dave Matthews Band. The only song that sounds like a Dave Matthews Band song is ""Everyday"" this is because it sounds exactly like one of their past songs, ""#36."" Anyone interested in this band should do themselves a favor and buy one of their early albums, like ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" or ""Live at Red Rocks."""
2,Huge DMB Fan...and this album is by far the worst,"DMB tried to do something new, and it failed. They just tried to rush out this album after the Lillywhite Sessions was leaked, but not released. The album in my opinino has 4 good songs: So Right, Dreams of our Fathers, What You Are, and Everyday. However, it also has many of DMB's worst songs ever (I did it, Angel). Go buy Before These Crowded Streets, that album is sheer perfection."
1,The worst Dave Matthews cd ever nothing like old stuff.,This cd is nothing like the others. I am disgusted that Dave would just sell out like this and totally change his image and music. I just hope he never releases something like this ever again.
2,Dave Matthews Band or Glenn Ballard Band?,"This album was a true disapointment for me. Dave's new producer has completely taken over on this album from co-writing the songs (as if Dave wasn't good enough on is own) to arrangements. Everyday don't even compare to DMB's previous efforts. And another thing, what happened to Leroi and Boyd? Are they just guest musicians now? You would think so when listening to this album. If you're a die-hard DMB fan buy it just for the collection. But lets all pray that this is not the demise of the DMB we've all fell in love with."
3,change isn't always good,"Being primarily a jazz and blues fan, the Dave Matthews Band is one of the few rock bands I enjoy. To give you an idea of where I'm coming from, I also like Robyn Hitchcock and The The. I think the DMB is one of the most creative, original, and talented group of musicians out there. This new album, however, deviates too far from their jazzy and rythmic African roots. Tinsley and Moore are hardly featured at all and the rest of the band sounds just like any other rock and roll band out there, although quite a bit more talented. If you are a DMB fan, the album is worth checking out. If you are looking into the group for the first time, you should check out the earlier studio albums or, my personal favorites, the live albums."
5,DMB Masters the Craft!,"Everyday is like an old friend coming home with great new stories. Every song on this CD brings you to new places. At first listen the CD sounds good, each time after it weaves it's way into your heart through your ears. Between Dave's voice, Stefan's exciting bass, Leroi's smooth sax, Boyd's wild strings, and Carter's perfect timing you are entertained, uplifted and taken on a journey that only these five men can lead you. If I could I would give it 100 stars but ... only allows 5."
2,What are they thinking?,"If this was their first album, I never would have bought any others, and would not have even bought this one if I heard it previous to its release. Its just not that good, and it came from a band that has proved they are capable of creating the best. Maybe it's just a matter of opinion, but the lyrics really ..., and the music is nowhere near what they have recorded. Maybe its a bold new step, or maybe they were sick of always playing the same sound, but to try and change what you are, just doesn't work. ""I want to rock you like a baby in a carraige car"" ? What the hell is he talking about, thats CHEESE."
2,Where did it all go wrong?,"I got this cd, expecting another masterpiece. I mean, ""I Did It"" is at least a *fun* song. But when I listened to the cd instead of just ""I Did It"" on the radio, I was *very* disappointed. The most fun you get out of the cd is seeing how many rhymes you count that don't have ANYTHING to do with the song, but are just rhymes. It was sickening. Put down the electric guitar, Dave, it's just not your thing."
1,"Streamlined, bland.","This album was produced by Glen Ballard - it shows. Usual DMB albums have songs that run to extremes - loud, soft, instrumentally focused, voice focused - and carry emotions and detailed sounds that run to extremes. This album feels like someone took it, and streamlined all the songs so that they are all 3-minute pop songs. Each one strives to be that - and they all end up sounding the same. Gone are the variations in tone, emotion, and strong instrumentation. Instead, all the instruments sorta just blend together into a big mush. Yeah, I guess this is what makes a pop hit - but this isn't what made people like DMB. I liked them because they were different - something that doesn't sound like every other pop hit on the radio. What was also best about DMB was that some of the best songs were the ones never played on the radio. Now that they all sound the same, some of that magic is gone. If you want this disc, I'd wait and get it used in a couple weeks or months."
4,Could have been better,"Let me start by saying that this is a very good CD. However, given that this is DMB we are talking about, its not as good as it could have been. First time I heard it, I felt a personal sense of loss because I did not think the songs were 'Dave' enough. However, the songs seem to grow on you and now I love at least these songs: Angel, Space Between, So Right, Sleep to Dream Her and Dreams of our Fathers.The thing that I did not like was pretty much what the other reviewers felt: there is not enough of the other band members in the record. Anyway, I respect Dave's artistic right to record whatever moves him and regardless of what he releases, I will buy it..."
1,ditto - I'm disappointed but Dave doesn't care.,"I hate to say anything bad about DMB, as I've been a huge fan, but I am disappointed in the new sound too. I couldn't even hear the other band members....certainly not any solos. The collaboration with Glen Ballard doesn't work for me, and I am a big Alanis fan too. I hope this is just a one-time experiment and that Dave will get back to the sound that we all love so much! This reminds me of an album that Pat Metheny did without his band, ....a studio produced sound with synthesizers and backround orchestrations. Some nice songs and melodies, but not the unique sound we had come to expect. It's the same thing here. Let's hope it won't last. We miss the DMB sound!!"
1,Over Produced Money Maker,I don't proclaim to be a huge DM fan. But I do enjoy the funky grooves they sometimes pull out of their ensemble. This album doesn't do it for me at all. Its over produced- slightly dreary- and uninspired. Its all too common- band makes mucho money- band becomes uninspired.
1,Sigh....,"I have avidly loved DMB for years, and i don't know what i'm listening to here. There's no song that can anchor me to any part of this CD. I don't really know what to say.I drive to work and try and give this album valuble commuting time, but i find myself longing for the chaotic intro of Warehouse. Or the grooviness of Crush. Say what you will about old DMB- it was original <reminisces fondly of Minarets>One serious point, over the summer tour Dave referenced songs like JTR, Grey Street, and the like as to be ""on the new album coming out this fall."" Were those songs scrapped with Mr. Lillywhite? If so, bad move boys, bad move.On the ""DMB bootleg stock market"", Summer 2000 tracks have been upgraded to ""strong buy"" from ""hold"".... ha ha."
2,Wish it were better,"I tried to like this album. I really did. But it just never got there. No matter how much I listened to it, the music couldn't live up to what I know DMB can do. It's not even good pop. It's just not. I own plenty of DMB. If you want a good album, buy Busted Stuff. If you want some great insight, try Some Devil and the special CD available wtih it (some of Dave Matthews' best yet), but don't waste your money on this one. If this album is your intro to DMB, you will never buy anything else, and that would be a shame."
3,Good Album--would have been better,"The album is pretty good. The other reviewers are right, this is not traditional Dave, but I have a feeling that it's because RCA made them scrap the album the band was going to release. If you were at the summer and fall concerts, you would have herd some of the songs that were going to be released--Gray Street, Grace is Gone, etc... But overall, the songs are good, with the exception of track two which has a very unusual ending (no fading, it just cuts off)."
1,My wife and I both hate it. We never agree on anything.,"There is one thing that my wife agree on, and that is Dave Mathews. We loved everything before this, and HATED this one. This isn't just a bad Dave Mathews CD, it is a bad CD.I just can't figure out half of these reviews being positive.DMB music is awesome. Buy the Tim Reynolds & Dave Mathews live album if you want something to play over and over and over... Buy this one if you need another slot in your CD case filled with waste.DAVE PUT DOWN THE ELECTRIC GUITAR. PLEASE!"
3,I LOVE DAVE MATTHEWS BAND,Dave Matthews Band has to be one of the best bands. Not only are all their lyrics thought out the music is superb. They are all so talented. I WISH THEY WOULD DO A CONCERT IN ALBERTA SOMETIME SOON!!! ;) Thanks Dave Matthews for all your music!! WE LOVE IT!!!!Eric Eklund
3,eh... Hope it's Better Live,"Let's just get one thing straight, this isn't a BAD album. It doesn't compare to any of Dave's previous work but you could do much worse this year. I forced myself to listen to my CD for two days in a row. I tried hard to make it grow on me, just like Before these Crowed Streets did. I have found a couple songs that I really like, namely, Dreams of our fathers, Everyday and Angel isn't too bad. I just hope these songs are better live, and Dave stops repeating the hook and lets Leroi and Boyd do there thing. Well, until I get to see them live, when's that new Springsteen CD coming out? There's no way Ballad could screw that one up."
2,Just not UP to par,"People listen to the dave matthews band for touching lyrics and a sound that is like no other, this is achieved by the contrasting insturments and the way they blend together to form a piece of music that tops everything. Everyday is trash, it feels like it was hastily produced and if i was boyd tinsley i would feel neglected just like his nonexistant violin. Dave's lyrics just arent there to grab the listener and keep them happy. Listen to Everyday, then throw on Crash and see how shitty this CD really is. Everyday attempts to cash in on crappy melodies that have no real business being in a dave matthews album. I am an old fan and this album just doesnt make the grade for me, it reminds me of Phish's farmhouse, in their attempt to go mainstream. Its sad to see a group who rocks get away from what they do best."
2,Written In A Week,"This CD sounds as if it were written in a week, and I think it actually was. Lacks all the passion and soul of all earlier music. Saxaphone and Violin are nearly obsolete. I am a big DMB fan, but I would not reccomend this album to anybody looking to buy their first DMB CD."
2,"Probably ""The very worst"" of DMB !","From the moment I own ""live at luther college"" and found there maybe my favorite album ever, I thought DMB was great. It's not on this terrible album. There are only two good songs (maybe !) ""If I had it all"" and ""The space between"" and I can't listen the others (so annoying, so bad !). FORGET THAT ONE !"
4,utterly disappointing? --- No!,It is a great album to new listeners of DMB. In fact it probably drew a lot of new listeners to him. He did not sell out and I think that is a new refreshing way to listen to his music.
4,Josh Coady,"didn't like it much at first as a die hard dave matthews fan, thought it was too ""pop music"" .. but it grew on me and now i love it, would recommend to everyone. old and young."
2,Everday,"I hear many Dave Matthews Band fans remarking on how original it is to have horns, violin and other instruments taking center stage at a rock concert. Like Dave Matthews invented this format or something. Ever hear of Van Morrison? It's been done. And there is not much originality to Matthews voice either, he sound like a odd mix of Sting and Peter Gabriel. I think that this band is getting so much acclaim because there are so few good bands out there. We are inundated with Britney Spears and the like. DMB have some good songs, but their albums are not great and Everyday is probably the worst. If you prefer the real thing don't waste your time with these imitators."
3,A little disappointing,"I love DMB, and have all their CD's, but i have to say that this one is a little on the boring side. The new sounds just aren't them anymore."
1,WOW... what a let down,"Ok.. where do I start.. This could quite possibly be the worst production I have ever seen. The band has turned into a teeny boppin concert, and their music shows it. If you know dave, you know that his past cd's have been good, sometimes amazing, however this cd is the epitomy of horrible. I honestly believe this could mark the end of Dave, and maybe a new beginning with N'SYNC."
1,No 0 Stars?,"This is CR@P! I returned it promptly! I bought it last year and was not happy, but what do you expect? it sounds like all the other tripe thet put out."
1,Not Worth A Goddamned Token ! ! !,One good advice: Spare your money on something else. Do yourself a favor: Don't buy this! The DMB is monitored by the Z^P.
4,A New Discovery,"The Dave Matthews Band are new to me. I havent really heard that much of them untill a friend sent me a tape of their new album and i loved it. The album contains excellent tracks like I Did It, Angel, Everyday and So Right that have made want to go out and buy the album for myself. Im also going to go out and try to find their back catalouge as i think that they are going to be worth a listen"
5,Very well done!,"I liked this CD! I am not a traditional Dave Matthews Band follower, so I can't draw on any of their previous work. But I can safely say this CD satisfied me. The creative mix of instruments was easy to listen to and didn't disrupt the flow of the songs. Dave Matthews voice is also a pleasure to listen to. The lyrics were well crafted and cleaver. Give it a listen, it's well worth it."
1,I'm only rating this to bring down the average,"The only reason i'm rating this is bacuase i want to bring down the average rating. Basically, this cd really sucks. i just started liking dmb during last summer. I bought this cd and at first it was ok. but then i listened to all the other cds and learned how wonderful they really are, and when i played this cd i realized it isn't the same at all. dmb is the best music ever, so if you like music go buy another cd, but if you like the whole pop music stuff, then you should look into this. Dave is amazing, and even in everyday although, you can barely tell it is dave. If you liked this all i have to say is go listen to the other stuff because it is the most wonderful stuff ever. Also go find a big dmb fan and get them to give you the lillywhite sessions, because that is really good."
1,Just...no,"Being a long time DMB fan, I feel a bit as if I'm betraying the band. But honestly...this CD is, hands down the worst one yet. Lillywhite Sessions is WAY better, they should've released that one. I absolutely refuse to listen to ""I Did It"". I hate that song with a burning passion. The only acceptable songs on the CD are ""The Space Between"" and ""Angel""."
2,Inferior to the Lillywhites any and EVERYDAY...,"Saw Dave last night, in fact. He played 9 of the songs from this album. Interestingly, he used old chestnuts and Lillywhite session songs strategically, to try and minimize the weakness of this material. I applaud his attempt to find a new direction; I hope that he keeps trying. All but 2 or 3 of these songs should be (permanently) shelved, as quickly as possible. Find yourself a copy of the Lillywhite sessions, listen to it, and then start the fascinating process of trying to understand how an artist can abandon such beautiful, personal work (in favor of this strange concoction)."
3,Different Sound,"For those who liked the old-style DMB, this CD will sound a bit different.First, Dave mumbles more. I know, he has always mumbled, but it seems more pronounced (or unpronounced) on this CD.Also, there is a cruel irony here: The soungs seem more attuned to the radio crowd, yet they are at the same time less listenable. How did they pull that off?The sound, to me, is a bit more monotonous, less listenable. Give me back my old DMB, please."
2,"Dave, what did you do?","Dear Dave,This cd you put out, entitled Everday, has to be the lousiest cd i've heard.....from you. This cd had the hype to be the biggest and best cd you have had, but instead it turned out to be a flop, in my mind atleast. But with failure, comes an unusual form of success. I have grown fond of the song ""the space between"" since you performed it on Saturday Night Live. It is an amazing mix of all the instruments you use, and is kind of a flashback to your more glorious songs, such as ants marching, and crush.I'm sorry i had to write what i did, and rate it what i did, because i am a huge fan of yours, its just that i didnt quite accept the change from one style of music to the other."
4,Buy it anyway,"OK, all you DMB fans watch out, sharp turn left straigt ahead. DMB broke the mold with this one, and while progressiveness is good, I'm not sure if this is a sign of development, or just change for change's sake. For those who remember the good ole ""under the table and dreaming"" days, you'll like ""Father Mother"" and ""Dreams of our Father."" They feature Dave's warble and DMB's electic rhythms in full effect. For those ready to move on past ants marching, ""I Did It"" is a real rocker. All the rest of the tracks will take a couple spins to get used to. They are mellower and the lyrics are a little more cryptic. But, in the end, I would say get used to it. The tracks grow on you, and have a nice groove to them. Besides, DMB has a real tendency to be the trendsetters, not followers, so they might set the pace for what we will be hearing from other artists in the not so distant future."
2,Extremely disapointing.,"When I first got it, I was excited about what it might contain, because I loved ""I Did It"" and ""The Space Between"". Unfortunately, those are the ONLY good songs on the CD. I guess I'm not supposed to say this, because I live in DMB's hometown of Charlottesville, VA. After listening to the first few tracks, I have only picked this album up a couple times, and that was to listen to ""I Did It""."
2,Bad,"This album is like musical wallpaper with words. Hello DMB, are you there? Where did the good stuff go? Lilywhite sessions are more to my liking."
2,Hated It!,"This album sounds like ""warmed over"" Peter Gabriel meets Pearl Jam. This was my first Dave Matthews Band album and will certainly be my last!"
2,DMB -- Long time fan and this album sucks,"This album, like Before These Crowded Streets, was a major disapointment. The songs are almost all pop, without the awesome jam-band sound that made Remember Two Things and Under the Table and Dreaming great 5-star albums. Don't waste your money. Dave Matthews Band is one of my favorite bands of all time, but I think this album REALLY sucks overall."
4,"Great album, BUT....","I was introduced to DMB a couple of years ago, it was the Live from Red Rocks album. Brought it back to Europe and played it over and over again. Later I bought Crash and Under the Table and Dreaming, so good you play it over and over again. Heard I Did It on national radio (first time I've ever heard DMB on the radio in Denmark)and the impression was that Everyday is more mainstream than previous albums and the texts aren't as deep and thoughtful as previously. He doesn't play with the words the way he used to, maybe because he doesn't write them himself. Everyday is in my opinion not nearly as timeless as previously released albums, but still way better than most other albums out there."
3,Disapppointed,"I have been a Dave fan since 1994. His music and lyrics have progression and impressive development that I have admired. I don't get that feeling in this production. Though there is some spontaneity in the When the World Ends and there is some world beat in the cut Mother/father, the rest of the album is average. I miss the impromptu sounds of the early studio work and, of course, the live recordings. This album proves that Westcoast radio-focused producer Ballard doesn't get IT. Dave Matthews Band is best when they let the music flow together, not pre-package it. The band has made it BIG with it's real interaction with the crowds this album does not have that feeling. What a disappointment."
3,Not as bad as everyone thinks!!,"First things first, this cd isn't as bad as everyone thinks!! DMB decided to go in a new direction and that is fine. There are some great songs on this cd(The Space Between among others) and when Glenn Ballard took over, everyone should have realized that there was a new sound coming!! All bands must evolve and change their sound over time, its called growing. Needless to say, I miss the old DMB just like a lot of people do, and yes I do own a copy of the Lillywhite Sessions which are far superior. You get to hear other instruments besides guitar! Anyways, I'm gonna catch the boys from Virginia on the road this summer so maybe that will renew my faith in the band. I would suggest buying this cd, its good, but just be ready for a change."
1,more like Dave Thomas.....,"this is really bad stuff. its a good thing Mr. Matthews made an apology for this album (ask any member of the warehouse). there are plenty of DMB cds, get the others. this is aweful."
4,Open Minded,True Fans should be a little more open minded as to How DMB wants to play ans sound. A creative musician likes to expand his horizons which is what DMB has done on this album. Maybe it isn't what you would like to hear from him but how can you limit your favorite musician to just one style of music. Shame on you for putting him in a position to do just that. If you limit him then he just become another predictable artist. I happen to like this album and hope he does some more different stuff. It shows that he is open minded and is willing to take a chance. So to all the DUMB Fans limit his style and you end his career.
1,Dave needs to rethink his approach to music,"I understand Dave Matthews was attempting to try something new with this album, and I respect that. He had a pair of balls on him for going in this direction, but it didn't work. Millions of DMB fans are throwing their hands up in rage at the pop-oriented sound Dave has tried to swing on this new CD.It was an experiment.. it didn't work.. and the new DMB album will be fantastic, as his old stuff always was. Nothing to worry about."
4,Why do I beg like a child for your candy?,"If you think you are going to hear more of Dave's insightful lyrics backed by the bands complex music. You will be disappointed. This cd is loaded with very simple lyrics backed by very basic music and if it was done by anyone other than DMB it would be an incredible cd. However, we expect someting diffrent from this band and not everyone adjust well to change. I have old enjoyed by Dave's great lyrics and this cd doe not have them. But, I admit I have listen to this cd about 20 times since last week and it gets better everytime. Highlights include Space Between, What you are and Mother, Father. These songs should be incredible in concert. So pick it up and get ready for the tour!!!!"
5,A very satisfying collection of tunes. . .addictive!!!,"While the song that is supposed draw people to this album (I Did it!) is a little disappointing (it's growing on me), I find this album hypnotic and addictive. Starting with ""When the World Ends"" with its shapely musical passages and continuing all the way to the upbeat ""Everyday"", this album has a lot new and different aspects which I feel other DMB albums had lacked (especially ""Before these Crowded Streets""). I am a fan from 1993 and a lot of what got me excited about DMB back then is present in this album. While held in check, I think Boyd Tinsley and Leroi Moore were used extremely effectively.This album is fresh and very satisfying. I was a little skeptical about it - hearing the song on the radio, but I think it would make an excellent addition to anyone's music collection."
4,Mixed Feelings,"I can understand how most long-time fans of DMB can complain about this CD. There isn't the familiar sound of Dave's acoustic guitar, the absence of group jams cut the tunes to 3-4 minutes, and it seems that the band has sold out their sound a bit to the commercialized cash cow known as pop music. However, the truth is, it's still great music. Dave and friends have been playing together for so many years that they thought a change would be refreshing. I'm a musician, and I know that trends in music are constantly changing (more often now than in the past), and if it isn't new, it's through. Miles Davis changed and innovated music at least five times in his career, and he's considered to be a genius. I can't put Dave in the same league as Miles, but you get my example. Anyways, this CD might not be the best the band has put out, but it deserves a little more credit than it's receiving."
2,First Dave Matthews solo album,"Lest face it: this is the first Dave Matthews solo album. It's not a great album but is OK. In the other hand, I'm still waiting for the really next Dave Matthews BAND album, and I think a lot of people are waiting too."
4,...,YES..it's different..but it's a great album!!!..no clue why so many people seem to hate it..definitely worth buying!! i love it...
4,Very Decent and Recommended,"My favorite album is CRASH but this one has many killer tunes.""So Right"" and ""Mother Father"" (w/ Carlos Santana) just blew me away. I can't wait to see them live again this summer. This unique band is even better in concert!"
1,The Best was Left with Lillywhite,"To anyone who claims ""Everyday"" to be a good showing of Dave's talent...well then you're right. To anyone who claims ""Everyday"" to be a good showing of The Dave Matthew's Band...well you couldn't be more lost. Dave should of saved Carter and Tinsley's time and just hired some studio musicians for this lack luster performance. I refuse to ever believe that Dave has gone cuckoo, but firing Lillywhite for Ballard was just awful. Think of it this way, Lillywhite produced Phish, which although some Dave fans might not care, they do play a similiar genre of music. However, Ballard produced Alanis?! Were is the connection? Unless Dave is on some sort of pop-MTV binge, then he needs to listen to his fans, which from my understanding, are quite confused by ""Everyday"""
1,No more sparkle in DMB,"DMB was a great band when they came onto the music scene. However, they've forgotton how to be innovative. ""Everyday"" is flat out boring, and seems like they are only trying to put out an album to make money. I'm sorry I wasted mine."
1,Dave! What Happened?,"I'm not gonna say ""They Sold Out..."" I promise. But the simple fact is, this cd sounds infinitely more like Matchbox 20 than DMB. I just don't understand. I was so excited to get this CD, even though I really didn't like ""I Did It"", but I almost choked at first listen. Dave tells us the Lilywhite recordings were too depressing, BUT WE ALL LOVED THEM LIVE!! Jeez, if you want some upbeat songs, toss a few into the Lilywhite album and actually break the good old 11-12 song threshold. Don't scrap a masterpiece to give us 9-day old schlock! Frankly, I got tickets for the June 6 show (Turner Field! ARGHHHH!) and I'm really not getting my hopes up. I guess at least the songs from Everyday will give me time to take about a dozen bathroom breaks.Oh for the days when ""Lie in Our Graves"" and ""Two Step"" rocked my world."
1,SO Disappointing!,"I really am very disappointed with Dave's style of music on this CD. Its almost disgusting! Sure some people may like the style, but its not Dave. No studio release will ever beat Under the Table and Dreaming. I sure hope Dave's next studio release will not be like this one, this one was completely disgusting. Everyday was the only song i could put up with, and even that one i was just sitting there like ""Is this even Dave Matthews?"" It is not at all Dave's style. So if you have never heard this CD and like Dave's original style, DO NOT GET THIS CD! You will be very disappointed. If you think any of those songs would be good live, I've been to 15 DMB Concerts this year and i heard about every song on that CD live, IT IS NOT ANY BETTER! The Space Between just is sickening. I'm not saying that any of the songs are bad, none of these songs are Dave."
2,2 For Talent- That's It Though,"These songs, like every other Dave Matthews song every recorded (in my opinion) are as boring and pointless as you can get. All my friends love Dave Matthews, but I just see them as a waste of talent. They have a very strong band in all sections(except for Dave's singing). This boring, fusion-utilizing, bizzare version of your Grandpa's favorite jazz band is not the kind of music that you'd hear at a party or want to rock out to at a concert, but more like the kind of music they play at your funeral. But I will give credit where it's due. They are all great musicians, but Dave will never be as good as an (read:electric) electric guitar player as say a Slash, a Tim Mahoney (311) or an Eddie Van Halen (actually, nobody will probably surpass Eddie Van Halen on the six-string anytime soon). And while Carter Buford is a world-class drummer, ahem, he is not the best. The best... well that guy from Rush perhaps? Or Max Weinberg? Come to think of it, how about Alex Van Halen?!"
1,"a good album, just not a good Dave Matthews Band album","Glen Ballard should be shot for this piece of garbage. If you are a fan of DMB, you will not like this album. It just doesn't sound like them. What in the world made Glen Ballard think that after millions and millions of albums sold that the band needed a new sound? Go buy ""Busted Stuff"" if you want something new."
3,"Great CD, But What Happened?","Yeah, I'm a BIG DMB fan, and I think that the CD is very good. So why 3 stars? 'Cuz they're not as good as they could be (IMHO). Spending time with Santana rubbed off on Dave as he plays with the electric guitar and some very Santana-esque riffs. The band is trying a new direction and it works, just not as well as their old stuff. Dave's lyrics are not quite as mood stirring as usual either. Basically, this is much more of a studio and mass audience album than previous ones. So while I think that the album is great on its own and will grow on you, be prepared for a sonic departure from what has made the DMB so popular."
1,Don't WASTE your money,"This goes for everyone that listened to ""Under the table and dreaming"", ""Crash"" and ""Before these crowded streets"" and found an unique band with a diferent kind of music, a great music indeed. You won't find that in Everyday, it doesn't sound like DMB, but much more like any band around. The uniqueness is gone. It's really disappointing. read carefully the ""Not as good as it should have been"" review posted in March 8, 2001 by A music fan from United States. He explains very well in details what I am saying."
2,"It stinks, everyday","Like everyone else writing in, I'm a big DMB enthusiast. Sad to say, then, that the new one is a true stinker. I'm not upset that he allegedly ""sold out"" - many artists have done that and still made great albums. What it comes down to are the songs - and most of these songs suck. Why do they suck? They're boring. They're redundant. The lyrics are weak. Listening to the album is, basically, a tedious way to spend your time.As a dutiful Dave fan, I've tried the album out about six or seven times. That's all I can stand; I tried my best.""Everyday"" - RIP. February 27th, 2001 - March 10, 2001. Sorry you had such a short life span in the rotation. Hope you're better in concert this summer!"
1,:(,"Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, they have. The Dave Matthews Band is by far my favorite band. This album doesn't even do justice to their music or their sound. I can only hope that they will go back to the music that has made millions of people fans. This c.d. is for the mainstream pop culture, nothing like the riffs and impromptu playing of Boyd, Carter, Leroi, and Stefan. Dave kind of stole the show, and even with his amazing voice, the other guys in the band have amazing talent that was not displayed on this album. I gave it one star because after all it is Dave, but please let this be a learning experience!"
1,Glen Ballard is the Devil,"Even though I just started listening to DMB about a year ago, it's been a long year of listening. Now, one year later, 50+ songs known by heart, and with a handful of live shows experienced, I got my hands on this CD. When I read that Ballard was taking over production I wasn't sure what to think. I hoped that he wouldn't upset the band's style...that is exactly what he did. These are not the kind of songs DMB fans are used to or will appreciate; do you picture people holding up lighters at his concerts for these?! And where is Tim Reynolds? If this would have been released as an experimental album then I might not have such a problem with it. Instead, this is what the fans get after three years of patient waiting. I sincerley hope this album doesn't destroy the band's reputation, however, I hope it does get Lillywhite back on the next album."
1,"If you are a DMB fan, do NOT buy this album...","A more appropriate title would have been, Glen Ballard, featuring the Dave Matthews Band...I really can't believe 1) DMB would pick Ballard as a producer, and 2) let him play on the album. Half the problem is having to listen to this guy's infantile ""keyboard's and arrangment's""...the other half is the songs, not only are they a complete departure from even the latest DMB offerings (JTR, Bartender, Grey Street, Grace Is Gone, Raven, etc.), they are boring and unenjoyable. This is not a ""DMB"" record, this is a record to get some radio time. Period. If you listen to the other... Ballard has produced, you would probaly like this, if not steer far away from it. Griff:"
2,It hurts me,"Its a good album, but not what I've come to expect from Dave over the years. Unexpected is fine. But, when it is what you'd expect from any number of overproduced, undertalented pop bands, well it sucks. They're on TRL for cryin out loud. But, I digress... I'm just gonna pretend this album never was released and go download the LillyWhite sessions and rock myself into musical oblivion."
4,"Different, but Good","I admit to being a lover of bands that change their sound, minimizing song remakes (from their old cds), so that soungs sound so...fimilar with that hint of flair. What hardcore DMB fans aren't realizing when they listen to this CD is that all the members are writing an ablum which shows them emotionally growing. Not that their sound is similar, but it is comparable to what Radiohead does with their CDs, none are the same. I must admit I was very dissapointed in the lack of violin and sax. Listening to the sound and the words on the Everyday album, there is actually meaning to them, and any DMB fan should realize this, and not automatically shut it down because the sound is different. However, minus a star because although the lyrics have meaning, and I don't mind whena band changes its sound, I think Dave has been a little too accomodating for Ballad."
2,This should have been the hidden album,"I love DMB, don't get me wrong, but this is not DMB. This is a Glen Ballard album in which Dave Matthews is the mouthpiece. This is Britney Spears pre-fab rock. Buy this if you must, but only after you get on a music sharing service and download ""The Lillywhite Sessions"", the actual next DMB record. It is great, this one is just barely okay."
2,I wish I could hear the one that they didn't release,"First of all, this album seems to embody the the term sell-out. Dave didn't even write these songs. This is just over-produced music industry fluff. Very bland, and very bad.Now, what happened to the album DMB recorded with Steve Lilywhite that is suppose to be fantastic, if not radio frinedly? I wish I knew. I do know that it has been floating around the internet, and I'm going to find it. Anyway, some powers that be made them stop that album near its completion and put together this horrid mess of an album. I only gave it 2 stars because it is DMB, it really deserves 1."
2,Extremely Disapointed,"As a huge DMB fan, I was eagerly awaiting their next release. Unfortunately, when it finally came I was extremely disapointed. I never thought DMB would sell out, but they did...DMB decided to abandon their fans so they can appear on TRL more often... hopefully they will come to their senses soon and release the album that should have been with tracks like grey street and bartender."
3,"A different DMB, but not the same as DMB of old.","This album has some interesting songs on it. I must admit, I was into ""I Did It"" when I first heard it on the radio and I really like ""The Space Between"" and ""So Right"", but after that, none of these songs are really that good. DMB fans who enjoyed the ""Crash"" and ""Before These Crowded Streets"" albums would be better to download ""The Lillywhite Sessions"" from (...). These are the new songs DMB treated us to on their summer 2000 tour. They include ""Grey Street"", ""Sweet Up and Down"", and ""Bartender"". DMB fans check it out!!!!"
2,Thud! Dave Matthews crashes back to Earth.,"After three totally amazing studio records and several rockin' live records Dave has crashed back to the land of the mediocre. If you are a fan of DMB you are going to be disappointed. This record does not sound anything like his previous sets. ""I Did It"" sounds more like Stone Temple Pilots than anything from DMB. There are precious few sax and violin licks and Dave has put away his acoustic guitar for an electric. The intricate musical qualities such as rhythm changes, syncopation and outstanding instrumentals are gone! Worst of all, their new producer (Ballard) has substituted ""grungy"" keyboards that aren't very good. Bands often change their style during their careers but in this case DMB has lost its edge!"
1,The Glen Ballard Band,"Glen Ballard would be ashamed of himself if he weren't so busy playing all the parts meant for Tinsley or Moore. His keyboard is is almost as loud as the simple new(but un-original) arrangments:Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus. In nearly every song. A few of the songs stand out nicely, and they sound good live, but with the producer trying to play the collaborating musician, everything goes to pot. Dave's lyrics are probably the weakest they have ever been, stuff any highschooler could write. Go buy one of the old albums."
5,1st Dave CD I bought,"I bought this cd a few months after it was released, and only listened to I Did It and The Space Between at first, but i slowly began to pick up on the other songs. In a couple months, I thought this album was the greatest ever made. I couldn't understand how 5 people could create something that sounded so good. I didn't get why a lot of ""big fans"" were saying that it wasn't very good.BUT THEN!! I heard some Luther College stuff and started to get the rest of their albums. By the time Busted stuff came out, I had all of their cd's and was obsessed with DMB. Then I understood why hardcore fans didn't like it that much...In comparison to the rest of their discography, It's not very good. But, that doesnt mean it stinks. The only thing wrong with it, is that it needs is that certain enery that makes the band tick, so when you hear everyday stuff live, it sounds greatSo, its not the greatest Dave studio cd, but it doesn't deserve all of the bashing that people are giving it either."
1,Don't make this your only DMB CD,"I am a die-hard DMB fan. I never thought I would buy an album of theirs that I didn't love. BTCS took a while to grow on me, but I eventually loved it, just like all the previous offerings of Dave and Co. I was excited about Everday, and I bought it on the first day it was released. After listening to it only once, I tossed it back in the jewel case and never listened to it again (the radio stations played more than enough of it for my tastes). I felt let down, somehow, by this cd. Everything that I loved in a DMB cd seemed to be missing in this one (I have been known to jump up,dance, and sing at the top of my lungs to most DMB songs. This is particularly dangerous when I am driving). There was no passion in Everday. I don't feel inspired to boogie by this cd. My suspicions about the cd were confirmed when (on the same day) I heard Everday on a Soft Rock ... station, at the grocery store, and in an elevator."
2,Why Dave?Why?,"I felt that this CD was sub-par for Dave Matthews Band records.While it would have been a masterpiece for any other band, fan of the Dave Matthews Band have come to expect more musically from the band. The lyrics were almost there, but the music was just way off. If you liked Crash, Live and Luther College and Under the Table and Dreaming, I wouldn't recommend this CD for you."
1,May other experiments be more succesfull,"The admiration of Dave Matthew's music started for me with the Crash album. The overwhelming and typical sound of the music made me seek for more. Live at Luther College was a masterpiece of it's own kind and travelling around the world I infected a lot of people with the DM virus. Hearing this live album over and over again one discovers little masterpieces in each song. DM songs became my most favourite ones. Then BTCS with the juggling pieces of voice, guitar, violin and saxophone parts, made me feel there was no better way playing this album than it was done. So when I just heard the samples of the new album somehow brought me in a state of shock. Almost nothing reminded me of the beautifull sounds of previous albums. Every artist has a right for discovering other fields for evolution of its music and to experimentate with it, but I would say DMB took the wrong turnpike here. But there's nothing wrong with turning back and exploring other directions."
4,"Not Bad...But Hey, Can Dave Put Out A Bad CD If He Tried?","While this CD wasnt the greatest thing Dave has put out, It wasnt bad and a few of the songs had a hint of the ""old Dave"". I've been a Dave fan for about 5 years now (since I was 10) and he will ALWAYS be my favorite. If your looking for another ""Under the Table""...this definitely isnt it, but if your a hardcore DMB fan, atleast buy the CD. I guarantee that despite the different music you'll come to like it anyhow. (And yes, I agree Lillywhite Sessions was a far better CD, but I back DMB's decision 100%.)"
1,absolutely horrible pop album.,"im a fan of dmb, and this is unacceptable. their previous work had so much attitude and made you want to dance. what is this? it a few songs tailored to mtv music videos.. thats it.although i do like the space between (i mean, its hard to not like it when mtv and radio crams it into your head like that). but the rest is lacking. a disappointment. but they'll come back on top next time. its not the end of them. they are a very inspirational and talented group."
1,Say it isn't so!,"I have been a big, big, big fan of the DMB since their early stuff. Back then they were like a breath of fresh air on the music scene. Now, it's like they aren't even trying. And Glen Ballard just destroyed their sound. I hate to rate any album of theirs this bad, but I was so disappointed with this one. I resent spending my hard earned money on something they obviously spent no time or thought into. I'll hold out hope for one more decent album but this one surely is not it."
4,Do I think they've gone to far?,"by no means have they.Still not quite sure what all the hub-bub was about with the first single off this ""I Did It"", what's the problem?So, I adore this CD, but I adore Dave Matthews. All of the tracks are what you would expect from this caliber of a band and songwriter but in my opinion, ""When The World Ends"" is an amazing song. It's slightly different than what you are used to and the lyrical delivery (not to mention the lyrics themselves) are breathtaking..I don't mean breathtaking in a ""classical sense"" more like...did he say that? and..would he please say it again. Girls, you know what I mean!!I still prefer the Under The Table Dreaming which is on my top 10 CD list of all time but this one comes close, better than Crash in my opinion.The thing about Dave is, he just can't go wrong. Very talented along with the rest of the band. Unlike the Grateful Dead, there is a reason this guy has a strong following of fans. Buy it..you'll like it."
3,Not his best work.. but not terrible..,"I just got back from the DMB concert in Vegas.. and its clear even when they perform that their heart is not as much in this album..I really enjoy the songs When the World Ends and The Space Between but if I could find a way to remove I Did It from the CD I would..If you are new to Dave Matthews and you want to hear the songs on the radio, buy the cd.. but actually his older material is much stronger musically with much more percussion, horns, and bass.. The songs are much longer but more intellectually stimulating.. Of his older albums the best would be Under the Table and Dreaming or Before These Crowded Streets.. of his live albums (even more musically stimulating) Live at Luther College with Tim Reynolds is a fantastic 2 cd set..And quite honestly.. I have just heard the Lillywhite sessions.. the unreleased album that scrapped for Everyday... I hope he releases it at some point.. I will be the very first in line to purchase it.."
3,When are the Lillywhite sessions coming?,"If you are a radio rock/pop junkie, this album might catch on and introduce you to some ""new"" music, but for those who have followed Dave Matthews, it is a huge disappointment. Gone are the days of the lengthier jams with meaningful solos. Gone is almost all musical interaction and intensity found on previous endeavors. Instead it is replaced by formulaic, flat and meaningless music.Glen Ballard (producer) has tried to fix something that wasn't broken. And for anyone who has heard the sessions recorded with Steve Lillywhite (who produced the previous CDs) dubbed ""The Lillywhite Sessions"" knows that ""Everyday"" is not the REAL Dave Matthews Band. While the music on this CD is not at all bad, it is just a watered down version of one of the most eclectic and creative groups around. And to know that an entire album as good as ""Lillywhite"" sits on the shelves just makes it even worse.So release ""Lillywhite"" already!!"
3,"Professional, like a business suit","Compared to earlier albums, the music is tighter, more professional; but there's a definite loss of joy. I'm not a Dave fan, but I enjoyed ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" for its generosity of spirit that let me set aside my disagreements with his philosophies and just groove to the wonderful worldbeat-tinged jazz-rock. ""Everyday"" lacks that spirit. I have to wonder how so many of these songs can preach love and yet sound so cold and mean. Might be a high concept. Or might just be an unfortunate mismatch of time and place and material. Hopefully all those Dave fans out there who look to him for guidance about love and joy and spirit find those qualities in these songs when they hear them live. Because to my ear it's cold in the studio."
4,A Solid DMB Effort,"While some people may not like this CD for it being, too pop oriented, I really don't feel that is true. The Space Between does sound, oh, just a tad bit over produced but, aside from that track, it's a pretty solid effort. Dave Matthews is progressing and, trying his hand at a few new sounds on this CD but, it works nicely. Nothing seems like it's that drastic of a change from anyhting else he's done . Like I said, to me this is a good solid effort which I have listened to many more times than anything I've bought recently. If you like the DMB, buy this. I'm sure if he would have come out with a cookie cutter copy of his last CD there would have been just as many complaints but, just from a different crowd."
2,Save your money!,"Save your money and wait for them to release the Lillywhite Sessions [.... Take away Dave's voice from this album, and I guarantee you wouldn't be able to recognize the songs as being played by DMB. You can't say that about ANY other DMB album. It's as if Glen Ballard took the musicians and locked them in a 1x1 ft. box and made them play within it. Too bad. Get the Lillywhite Sessions. They're awesome! [....]"
4,"DMB's New Sound Takes Some Warming Up, But it's Great!","I went out and got the album the day it was released and the first time I listened to it, I was worried I wouldn't like it. Then I listened to it again and loved it. The CD offers many ballods with more electric in them as well as the band's usual songs that make you happy. I Did It is the best on the album. Everyday, So Right, Dreams of Our Fathers, and The Space Between are some other good songs. I like all of DMB's songs including these. Leroi Moore is as usual a genius on the sax. Tinsley is also as usual great on the violin and the best I've heard. I also tink that Carter is the best drummer I've heard. However the album doesn't meet up to the other ones which are all fives. It still is great with new sounds and abrupt endings produced by Glen Ballard. This is a must have for any DMB fan."
3,worst of the best.,"well, it's dave matthews band, so how bad can it be? It's not at all a bad album, if fact it's great. It's just all the other DMB albums are better. I fear this could be the begining of the end for DMB, but I hope they will get over this hump. Worth your money, but save it for after you have the other 3."
4,"Solid, not up to DMB standards","Everyday is another enjoyable cd by DMB, but it doesn't have nearly the same impact as their other albums. The hooks are strong, the guitars are edgy (I like ""I Did It"" unlike many fans), and they branch into some interesting new world music with ""Mother Father"" and ""Everyday"". Unfortunately, many of the songs are too poppy and lack their normal complexity and instrumentation. Leroi Moore's sax shows up only in short simple bursts and Boyd Tinsley's violin is mostly used as symphonic background noise. It sounds like Dave with backing musicians. It is still a good addition to their catalog but definitely not the place to start.On the other hand, The Lillywhite Sessions is a dark, introspective masterpiece with great instrumentation from the entire band. Get it if you can still find it on the Internet. If not, find a friend who already downloaded it. 5 Stars!"
2,sell-out,"I used to love Dave Matthews Band. They were original and inspiring. Yet as they get more famous, they seem to have forgotten about their original fan base to focus on the pop crowd. They've lost their edge, they sound just like everybody else on this album. This is a classic case of a good band gone bad, and letting fame and fortune get to their heads. If you're going to buy a Dave CD, get an early one. When they still remembered what music is all about."
2,DAVE!! WHAT HAPPENED??,"I thought ""Everyday"" was not the best that I know the DMB could have done. This, I think is just a little mistake or something. He will get it back, and comeback with an awesome CD-probably in the spring of 2003. I have faith in you guys!"
2,Give Glen Ballard the boot....,"DMB is a great band, and this album showcases that once again. However, the songs sound incredibly over-produced. This album is a creative stretch for a creative group, and I believe it would have worked a lot better if the mixing and remastering had been toned down several notches. Not the best studio effort from the group, but 10 of the 12 songs here have huge potential to be as standard as Tripping Billies or Ants Marching after fans here them live. Steve Lillywhite was doing great things with DMB, and why they decided to go on this tangent is anyone's guess, but they should stear clear of Glen Ballard's role as producer in the future."
1,Not a DMB Punch Drinker,"OK, their first couple of albums were good. This band can rock and perform and that drummer is one of the best I've heard and seen...but this album was like a migrane - painful to listen to, uninspired, and just taking up space in my collection...oh yea, I sold this album years ago...an unfortunate blip on the radar for this talented band."
3,my favorite Dave Matthews album,I've never been a huge fan. Dave's voice annoys me after a little while. I do think this is my favorite album by them. Many fans don't seem to like it but I can't understand why. Angel is my favorite track on here. This album got me into their other work which I had previously written off.
1,NO STARS...had to give it one,You people are crazy. This album sucks. Dave Matthews is overrated and his fans are chowderheads. Have a nice day.
1,a mess,"Reviews are usually ambiguous and impossible to tell what the reviewer really thinks. So, to get to the point, this album is horrible. Yes I like Dave. No I dont expect Ants Marching. Yes I am open minded. No I didnt judge the album on one listen. Where are the melodies? Wheres the emotion? Where are the the elements that made DMB original? I wont even mention that the lyrics are pathetic...."
2,"If You're Depressed, Listen to this CD","I am an avid fan of DMB (love Crash, Under the Table & Dreaming, and Before These Crowded Streets). However, this CD is so gloomy that it's hard to listen to. There are hardly any upbeat songs, and many of the slower songs sound alike. I heard that Dave Matthews was going through a depression when the band recorded this, and it obviously shows. Stick with the above mentioned if you are new to DMB. I strongly advise you not to purchase this mundane CD."
4,"Not your typical Dave, but still good","The Dave Matthews Band is amazing, simply put. Whether it be new music, or old music, or live music or acoustic; it doesn't matter. Everyday is no exception. The first time I listened to it, I thought, ""who IS this and what have you done with Dave?"" I really didn't have an opinion though. I didn't like it, I didn't hate it, and it CERTAINLY wasn't the DMB I was use to. However, it has grown on me. I will never consider it their best album (Under the table and dreaming has that hands down) and I do admit to missing his acoustic guitar (live at luther college is my favorite dave cd), but Everyday does have it's good points. To the fans who hate Everyday, perhaps even loathe it...give it chance. I've always been a huge DMB fan and will continue to be. Bands DO change, and Everyday does reflect a change. But there are still elements to it that belong solely to Dave. Overall, I'd give it 4 stars."
3,So-so,"Definitely better than the last cd, definitely worse than the first three. The songs are all very polished and well arranged. However, can't the band just be happy and carefree as they used to be. Sure they've matured, but so has everyone else. Are we all so mature that we don't enjoy fun, jangly, well-crafted hooks anymore?""Tequila drinking, oh our minds were wasted"""
1,Can this be Dave?,"I used to be a HUGE Dave Matthews fan before I bought this CD. He used to have cool instruments and good lyrics and good songs, but this CD is so bad that it makes me ashamed to say that I ever was a Dave Matthews fan. I found that the lyrics on this album were pathetically lame, and this is not at all what the old Dave used to be like. This album has taken a really pop style edge. To add to how bad this CD really is, Dave has this really annoying howling sound that he makes repeatedly in every song. Please DO NOT BUY THIS CD, it is an enormous waste of money. After I bought the CD and listened to it, I tried to sell it to anyone I could find so I could get my money back. Only no one wanted to buy it, even for the ENORMOUSLY CHEAP price I put on it."
2,What the hell?,"It pains me to say that this cd sucks. I love Dave, but this is just awful. Dave's electric guitar and the droning, manufactured sound of this cd, is enough to land ME in depression."
1,What were they thinking?,"I'm sorry. Dave Matthews Band has to be one of the most overly-hyped and boring bands that I've ever seen.This album lacks taste, depth and all the other elements to make an album a true standout. I don't really even know why I bought this album, I thought, maybe I would try to like them this time, but album after album, they are a true bore. Dave can't sing and most of their music sounds the same.I would suggest not buying this album - only if you are a true DMB fan."
3,A review from a fan in Israel,"Today is april 4th 2001 and I bout EVERYDAY yesterday. I wanted to go listen to it but the line was too long, so I bought it because I trust Dave Mathews Band. The album is good no doubt about it but I still think that they could do much better. As the other people wrote I don't think they should have been so harsh because even though it's not as good as I thought it would be it still is a very good album. Thank You, Ariel Makover"
1,SELL OUTS!,"To start, I was a huge Dave Matthews fan. This album was produced solely for one purpose--music videos and airtime. Nothing else. Dave's ""older"" music was rich with acoustic guitar solos, colorful lyrics, violin pieces and virtual drum solos that would entertain over and over again. All that and his lyrics are completely flushed down the drain with this album. There isn't a song that's over 4 1/2 minutes as far as I could tell [meaning that the band probably plans on making each and every song on the album a ""hit single"" with a video to boot], and found the tones and style from song to song totally monotonous. Advice to Dave-->lay off the electric guitar, buddy. Leave that to Tim Reynolds.It happened to Metallica, it happened to Rush, and now it's happened to Dave Matthews band---you all sold out.Dave Matthews Band is now less one fan..."
4,DMB turned a new leaf,"I was kinda skeptical when I first heard Everyday...but then like the other albums, it grows on you. For starters, ""I did it"" rocks you off your seat when you first hear it...for it is nothing like the other DMB songs. But if you listen closely, there is a little of the ""old Dave"" lingering in every song. The title track has awesome harmony. Granted the songs are a little ragged and edgy, this is definately a worthy buy so give it a chance and like mom used to say, ""You just may like it!"""
3,WHERE is THE VIOLIN,"Isn't Boyd tindsley the violinist and where are those crazy violin solos not seen since Crash and #41, a personal favourite."
3,decent but DMB's worst album,"I was really excited to buy this album when I heard how good it was supposed to be and how Dave thought it was their best work,then I listened to it and became much less excited. I've listened to their other cd's hundreds of times but I don't think I will with this one ,there are a couple of good songs but the rest are unrememberable. I hope DMB go back to their old way of producing and back to their old sound."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"I have been a DMB band for a couple years now and when I heard ""I Did It"" on the radio, I thought, ""What the HELL is that?!?!"" I couldn't believe that they made a song that was so...ewww. lol. But when I got the CD, everything changed. Every word in every song was so heartfelt...and the music behind was just a testament that they're just growing as should all bands! I can't wait to see them in D.C. to hear ""The Space Between"" and ""Sleep To Dream Her"" and ""Everyday"" I HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone who just wants to sit back and relax to hear some great music."
3,Not their best,"I have been in love with DMB for a while now. I love how their songs are usually half instrumentals and 8 minutes long but never get boring or dull.Well, this CD didn't give that to me. I love pretty much every song on it, but dmb just doesnt sound like they used to. The songs are very short; it's mostly just Dave singing, theres hardly any instrumental break; and I really think they were trying to change their style. It sounds more pop than anything else. I still enjoy this CD, but if you want to get a real feel of what DMB is about, pick up Before These Crowded Streets, which was amazing. Also, all their live CDs are terrific.Busted Stuff, the release after Everyday, shows that DMB is back to their old familiar ways. That was a great CD also."
2,Carter says...,"In an article from Rolling Stone magazine, Carter Beauford said this about Everyday:""My creativity, my expertise, as well as that of the other guys in the band, was smothered. The record didn't need us.""I couldn't agree more. This album lacks the jam sessions and creative stick/sax/violin work that the band is known for. It's basically just an overpowering Dave Matthews on electric guitar. Over the last couple of years I have desperately tried to like this album, but to no avail. There are, however, a couple of exceptions. ""When the World Ends"" is a real cool song, and if it hadn't been for 9/11 would have been a big radio hit. The title track ""Everyday"" is a knock-off of #36, otherwise known as ""Honey, Honey"" (or for the diehard fan, the song was originally ""Hani, Hani""). But the rest of the album is nothing more than dirty pop and thrives on the term ""sell-out""."
4,A different dave..,Traditional Dave Matthews Band fans will find this album very different with a much more 'produced' sound. While I still prefer his older work and attitude (as I think he does as well) this album is still good compared to most other pop-rock albums out there. Don't pass it by because it is different.
2,This cd is an excellant Matchbox 20/Third Eye Blind cd,This cd is an average cd but not what we expect from Dave Matthews. I never thaught DMB would turn into an MTV puppet but they have. I am disapointed that the orriginal CD produced by Lillywhite was not released. The record company execs and Dave felt that the Lillywhite CD was to depressing. Well.... Depressing is better than this buttle gum garbage Dave threw at us and expects us to eat it up. After hearing this CD I decided to sell my tickets to see Dave this summer. I can't contribute to a man who alienates his fan base. I do however like When the World Ends and Angel. But the rest of this CD makes absolutely no impact on me when i listen to it.
3,Could've Been Better,"I just got this cd for Easter, and I'd been dying to get it because I'd heard it was good from a friend...I have to say, I wasn't overjoyed...I think a lot of the music on the cd seems to center more around Dave himself, more than anyone else in the band, which is a real shame because with all those extremely talented musicians (especially Boyd and Leroi) that you never find in other bands, they shouldn't be bumped into the background...I don't think that the cd's _bad_, it's just not as good as they could've done with their follow-up to Before These Crowded Streets"
1,uhhh....,"Of course, like millions of DMB fans, i was extremely dissapointed with EVERYDAY. I've turned to DMB my entire life to escape this crap bubble-gum pop, because they didn't seem afraid to have 3 minute long music solos, entirely suggestive lyrics, and odd yet pefect vocals. i was trying to comfort myself by saying that they would soon get over this horribly sold out rut, but after reading that the change wasn't because of musical revolutions, but a change in producers, then the bands future began to look dull. Dave matthews lyrics, which were once amazing 7 minute long metaphorical poems, have been dumbed down to songs which mean nothing. ""I did it,"" i mean, what the hell is that. So all i can to now is hope they will hear the millions of cries, and change, but until then, i will listen to the phenominal UNDER THE TABLE AND DREAMING, BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS, AND CRASH. sorry Dave, but you've killed your career."
1,Dave isn't Atlanis,"If you were a fan of Dave's work up until Everyday, you're not alone. Dave's ""sellout-tinnybopping-TLR"" album is his worst yet, Hardly having and resemblance to the Dave Matthews Band which used more instruments than Dave's electric guitar and the Glen Ballard lyrics that could have been made in a studio ""Anyday"". If you want a real Dave CD find a way to go the scraped Lillywhite Sessions... That's the 5 star album."
1,Oh God No! Stop This Garbage,"I didn't know the Backstreet Boys joined the Dave Matthews Band, cause that's what this album sounds like. A BIG STEP DOWN from Under the Table, Crash, and Before These Crowded Streets. Short, pop songs with no violin or sax. Dave has sold out bigtime, veering this album towards the teenyboppers of today. A big disappointment..."
1,Just when you thought it was safe to buy DMB,"Just when you thought Dmb was a great musical talent, they turn Pop. Mind-blowing, isnt it? Myself and others use Dmb as our pop-relief, when the world is so full of ""it"". For us who love music, and know what music is, this new album is a swift kick in the balls. I'm just glad I had enough time to warn my friends. I did not realize what a negative impact switching to ballard would be. No more dave for awhile,'everyday' is in the trash, im ignoring the summer concert sales (it would be sad to see them attempt to play machine made music live...so pathetic on SNL), just the old 'remember two things' for me until their next album, another chance to redeem themselves. bring back lillywhite!"
1,Sad 'Day,"What a phenominal disappointment.With this album, Dave has abandoned all of the things that make him the most original singer/songwriter/musician of the last decade and floated a collection of generic aggro-pop tunes that only a teenage Alanis fan could love.Shame on you, Glen Ballard.When I was 20 my brother asked me if there was a single Grateful Dead song out of some 300 recorded that I DIDN'T like. I thought about it and realized the answer for me then was ""no"". I was completely and happily immersed in the whole Dead mythology. The only DMB fans who will like this album are the sycophants who blindly and automatically worship anything and everything that Dave foists upon them. They will convince themselves that Dave has bravely ""reinvented"" himself on this album, rather than realize that his creative juices have, at least for one album, sadly run dry."
2,Glen Ballard sucks,"Jerry Seinfeld defended his decision to end his sitcom prematurely by theorizing that performers should always leave their audiences wanting more. This is precisely the case with Everyday in that the songs are mostly catchy and listenable (albeit commercial and slick), but just when you are expecting a prolonged Boyd or Leroi solo, the music fades to silence. Then again, Aerosmith and Alanis aren't that big on violins and saxophones, right, Mr. Ballard? Michael Stipe was dead-on when he declared, ""damn that radio song,"" and unfortunately, we have 12 damn radio songs on our hands here. One can only hope that these songs are given more life and length on tour this summer."
3,good songwriting,"The songwriting was a lot better than before these crowded streets. But it came at the expense of the terrific instrumentals. It seemed like Glen Ballard was trying to downplay that aspect of the band, because he is a songwriter and producer and doesn't have the jamming mindset. I think it was good that he added the structure that he did, but then they should have cut loose at least in some parts. This album really does not show their talents, just Glen and Dave's songwriting abilities. The songs are good, but if it had unleashed the talents of the band to back it up it could have been so much better. Ballard took some weight off the band's shoulders which is good. I hope they get back to their free form roots though, and take it to the next level."
2,WHAT HAPPENED!?!,"After thoroughly enjoying UTTAD, Crash, and Before these Crowded Streets, I am VERY disappointed with this album! The three previous studio releases were fun... Everyday is dark, and dull. I listened to the whole album 3 times, and I can't remember any distinct songs! They all sound basically the same. There's a lack of other instrumentation (something that was present in the other albums).... I would recommend buying this simply to complete your DMB collection."
2,"Unfortunately, Everyday is overly produced.","Unfortunately, Everyday is overly produced. Dave Matthews said this album was ""about the band"", but the band has lost it's raw edge and appeal and doesn't sound as distinct as it once did. Dave's voice seems to get cluttered in all the band noise, which is electric guitar laden and has lost it's distinct, acoustical sound and has gone to a more pop or hazy electric guitar sound. You won't hear a single Boyd violin solo, acoustical guitar gets lost in the haze and Dave's voice is not heard as prominently as it once was...I guess because this album is, ""about the band""."
2,Bombastic,"Much has been made of the fact that early sessions on this CD were scrapped, and that Dave and producer Glen Ballard started from scratch, penning 10 of the songs in just 10 days! They sound more like they were written in 10 minutes: love bombs, indeed. The lyrics make ""Silly Love Songs"" seem majestic and poignant by comparison.The biggest problem is, Ballard's production philosophy seems to be make it busy and make sure everything is mixed at the highest possible level, all the time. This type of production leaves no room for discovering the hidden layers of a song, and all of the sonic bombast just makes one tired after about 3 songs--where is the instrumental and vocal subtlety displayed on ""BTCS"" or ""Crash""? (For that matter, where's the sax and violin this time around?)Bypass this and wait instead for the reissue of The Band's ""Rock of Ages."" THAT is an album that displays the kind of group interplay that is so absent on ""Everyday."""
2,Not the same old DMB,"I agree with the other reviewers -- this isn't the same old Dave. I didn't feel an emotional response to the music that I did with his earlier works. I played the CD a couple of times. Rather than capturing my attention, it was just background noise."
2,DMB: Caught in the Space Between,"Change is not bad. But change toward a sound we've heard before is boring. This album is uninspired and unoriginal. Riffs taken from Rush and Yes; vocals taken from Peter Gabriel; all solos cut down to size. This is the DMB's most ""pop"" to date. Gone are the days of long flourishing solos and mystical lyrics. This album proves that the DMB is no longer into the music as much as they are into the money and the hits. Although not entirely horrible, it's a severe disappointment. Be prepared for a ""Revenge of the Eighties"" feel. Tracks which stand out are ""Everyday,"" ""The Space Between,"" ""Angel,"" and ""Dreams of Our Fathers."" Other than those, it's a dud."
2,"Not their best, abandons their roots","I rushed out and bought Everyday on the first day it was available. I must admit I am disappointed. The other reviewers have all pointed out that this is a different sound for the band. I don't think its a change for the better. The sound is, while still containing some of Dave's unique features, much more like generic pop and rock than the acoustic, reedy, improvisational and airy sound that fans typically associate with Dave. This album may well end up being more popular with the general public and become his best selling album, but I really miss the lengthy, improvisational tracks from Before These Crowded Streets and the great surreal singles from the early albums. Granted I haven't really given it a chance to grow on me, but I don't think I'll change my view that this is by far the weakest of his studio albums."
4,Good CD,"First off, everyone will tell you that this album is very different from all of his DMB's other albums. I agree, but that doesn't make it bad. There are songs I like, songs I hate, and songs I love. I happen to hate ""I did it"", but ""When the world ends"", ""Angel"", ""What you are"", ""Dreams of our fathers"", and ""Everyday"" are amazing. But don't take my word for it. I don't profess to be a professional music critic. Listen to the songs yourself. Click on the links below or download some of the songs from kazaa. You won't be disappointed."
3,What happened to Dave?,"Ok, I own about every other album by the Dave Mathews Band, and was eagerly awaiting this one, but I'm not gonna buy it. What happened? They hired some producer to improve something that didn't need any help. Going from Under the Table and Dreaming to Crash to Before These Crowded Streets, one would think they'd just keep going up, then comes this. For the next album they should just go back to what got them here. Very disappointing."
3,"Not Bad Music, But not up to DMB Par","On the grand scale of music this cd ends up making the cut. It's not bad, if you spend some time with it it'll grow on you, definately. BUT, compared to any other DMB cd if falls drastically short. No song breaks the five minute mark. There's not jamming there's no REAL impressive musical talent. Lyrically Dave busts them out again with incredible lyrics, but the music just falls short compartively. Over all a good CD, but not compared to any other dave stuff, especially including the lilywhite sessions."
3,"Not the best Dave, but give them a break","Ok, so this is not the greatest Dave album ever released, but no one should blame them for this disapointment. Every great band has a sub-par release and i guess that was the case for this album. Sure, we all love the old stuff, and I'm sure DMB will return back to that in their next album. However, we can't look past the fact that there are some amazing songs on this cd, like everyday. Ok, so we all feel like breaking the disk when I did it somes blasting into our ears, but take the good with the bad. Look forward to the next cd from the greatest band of the present day."
5,Good DMB,"Great CD. Lot's of electric guitar which isn't the norm for DMB. This CD is a change is style, but back to the great form of his Crush album. A must buy for any DMB fan."
2,"Raw, yet refined...if you like it that way.","Yay for Dave Matthews for pulling himself out of a rut of depression by co-writing these 12 songs with Glen Ballard (of Alanis Morrisette's Jagged Little Pill success, amongst others). But his new sound, though musically credible, is under par. Not just for the lack of the ""Dave Matthews Band sound"" (the lack, on this album, of intense solos and acoustic mastery), but also under par for ANY band. Listen to this album with caution: would you think it was so great if it were the band's first album? If you'd never heard of the band or if you've never seen them live? No, this is not a bad album. But even though it is something new for Dave Matthews, it's not anything new for me, apart from Dave Matthews' unmistakable voice sticking out of over-produced songs with simplistic melodies. That's something I haven't heard before."
3,SOME GREAT SONGS!!!!,"EVERYDAY is clearly the album where DAVE and his GREAT band decided to took a POP direction for their music...DREAMS OF OUR FATHERS, WHAT YOU ARE, SO RIGHT and WHEN THE WORLD ENDS are among the greatest moments from DAVE MATTHEWS and band...."
4,"Great collection of songs, with one major complaint..","The music on the CD is great. This was a different direction for DMB. Definitely more of an adult-alternative sound compared with the jam band sound most fans preferred. However, that doesn't make it a bad CD. What makes this CD a little hard to listen to is the fact that it's completely compressed and the sound quality is garbage. If you don't believe me, check out any of the band's older albums. This is, by far, one of the worst mixing jobs I've heard on an album. Yet another album that could have been 5 stars had it not been for Chris Lord-Alge and his obsession with compression!"
3,Production made the radio star,"This cd is clearely intended to be the bestselling-radiofriendliest DMB album out, for the bands groovy jamming session skills are left out to be discovered only in live cds.Maybe the replacement of Lillywhite with noted producer Glenn Ballard was the key issue in why ""everyday"" is so commercial. Even the cover yells out ""sell out""but dont be fooled, this cd does not have music as accesible as it might seem. Most of the tracks come out as vague by the lack of content and lyrics.its a good album but not a great one.it has some very good songs...yet it was a real letdown to all DMB fans...And if the Lillywhite sessions are to be released as rumoured, the band and the record company might be actually accepting the commercial tone of the record.Maybe its the way that the band wanted the record to sound, or maybe it was the production that made it sound that way, but that still leaves us wondering where DMB will take us on their next record."
2,That's the wrong way!,"I'm a Portuguese Dave Matthews' fan and I feel frustrated with his latest work. Precisely when Europeans were starting to enjoy his intercultural rhythm, ballads, and all the mixed styles that he achieved to put togheter, he decided to put in jeopardy the reputation that he had conquered since 92. This change, for a more commercial style, wont (I hope) collect many supporters and will force the band to revise the strategy. I've been almost begging for an Eoropean concert, but now I have my doubts..."
2,Throw off the yoke of Ballard,"The joy for me of the DMB was it's musical wanderings. It was like watching a herd of wild mustangs. All were traveling in a unified direction but with much randomness. An occasional individual or two might veer off but always reunited with the group. Fast,free and unpredictable.This cd is like watching a plodding water buffalo burdened by a heavy sled, but a single road to follow. I would have readily accepted this cd had it been released as a single endevour. Then it could have been presented for what it is, a compilation of well constructed well thought out songs by Dave. But to market this as a Band effort while restricting these wonderful musicians from their creative input is just wrong. I hope and pray these songs will take another shape come concert time when chains may be broken and the music can grow on it's own.In short, as a solo effort good, as a band effort this cd blows."
2,Two stunning tracks among lesser mortals,"Angel is witout doubt a superb song and shows off Mathews vocal ability to trip from high falsetto to reverberating low register with fantastic effect. Very moving, melodic, full of pathos, real goosepimple stuff. ""Space Between"" has been played to death, and although it's a magnificent song with a mesmerising melody, I struggle to not skip the track these days, unless I'm in really good mood and I really want a song to rattle the car windows with as I zap up the I405!The rest of the tracks were a real disappointment I have to say. Nice, with some ctachy tunes, but nothing on the same scale as the above two"
3,"generally mediocre,","Although there are a couple of songs on this cd that I like (Mother Father and Dreams Of Our Fathers), it is not in my opinion the best work done by DMB. When I hear ""Everyday"", I am quickly reminded of the Dead's ""Shakedown Street"" Although not painful to listen to, definitely not the band's best work. Ok, but not great. Catchy. Radio friendly."
2,disappointing,DMB fan here who hates this album. Lousy short 3 minute made-for-radio songs. Angel is the most sickening song I've heard from this band. Never thought i'd use the word sickening to decribe a DMB song. One or two exceptions of course: Everyday and Dreams of Our Fathers have merits. That's it- nothing too articulate here. Just a quick review. Hope their next one is better!
2,Not Dave Matthews,been a dmb fan for awhile but was really caught by surprise by this one. its not dmb!! too commerical! go back to what made dmb great!
3,Dave Adds A Popish Slant,"The album ""Everyday"" is a decent, but does not live up to what I expected from Dave. It has a more popish sound and sounds like it was made for the radio. This album is very different from the old Dave and it isn't as good. The older songs from albums such as ""Before These Crowded Streets"" and ""Crash"" are Dave's better works. ""Everyday"" strays from the uniqueness of earlier Dave albums by the absence of Boyd Tinsley (Violinist) and LeRoi Moore (Sax). Even though ""Everday"" is a good album, it just doesn't match up to the older Dave."
3,Mixed feelings...,"As a long time Dave fan, I looked forward to this album. I can't say that I'm thrilled with it, but its not a bad effort. There are some okay songs (The Space Between, Everyday, Angel). However, it doesn't sound like the traditional DMB stuff and this disappointed me.This will probably be a sucessful mainstream album, but I found it a bit to 'popish' for my liking. If you want to really hear what DMB sounds like go for the classics like Crash or Under The Table and Dreaming."
2,Bottom of the rack.,"If you have been following DMB for the The 'DMB sound' don't bother with 'Everyday'. The album lacks the honesty, detail, and the tight arrangements associated with their earlier albums. The overall sound is more electric ( thanx to Carlos Santanas contributions to the Album ) and lack the raw 'jammy' feel. The band has clearly departed from its endearing blend of balanced instrument solos and intrusive vocals normally resulting in a tight sound. If not for Daves voice one would be hard pushed to recognize the band. This one belongs to the bottom of the CD rack......"
2,Disappointment,"I have been a fan for almost ten years - I go to the concerts, own all the albums, love about every single song....until now. This album is just plain disappointing. Where is Dave? I miss him. It's such a tragic sell-out, pop-culture, bubble gum, wannabe story. If you must purchase, The Space Between is the only decent song."
2,Great Collection of Top 40 Style Music,"This will no doubt be a readcord breaker in sales, but not because of its musical content. This will probably be their last original release before they breakup. I own every release from DMB, as well as many concert recordings, and this is by far the least creative. It has been over produced and over hyped. I have listened to it a dozen times and it still has not grown on me. As other reviews have mentioned, it does not have much Violin or Sax and it was this that made DMB different and special. If you like Top 40 style, buy it. If you want true DMB, try Red Rocks, Live at Luther College, Under the Table..., or even Crash."
3,Trying to fix what isn't Broken,"After listening to this disk for the first time, I could hardly believe it was actually DMB. Dave's unique sound is gone and it's been replaced by typical, over-produced ""music by committee.""Even though the sound of this album was designed to expand the band's fan base and get more radio play, I fear it will turn away the die-hards like myself. It just doesn't sound like the DMB anymore.I truly hope the band can go back to what made them truly great and please send producer Glen Ballard back to working with the boy bands or where ever he came from. He just doesn't fit DMB's style of music (the old one at least).I still give the album a three because a couple of songs are pretty good. There's just nothing that could rival incredible songs like Ants Marching, Lie in our Graves, Tripping Billies, etc."
1,A Disappointment,"This album is definitely a disappointment....I have been an avid fan since before ""Remember Two Things,"" and with ""Everyday"" DMB demonstrates further that they are willing to abandon whay they initially set out to do to gain/retain fan approval.....and to think that I had been looking forward to numerous albums worth of innovation.......this is boring. I'd've given it no stars, but that is not an option. You can do better, guys! MUCH!"
2,Horrible,"The worst Dave CD Ever, i couldn't believe it when i bought it. Dave and the band need to find there roots again i believe. There was this whole thing with Dylan's not gonna be the same after electric, but he proved it, he proved he could. Dave proved the couldn't, this is awful, it's made for MTV ..."
1,DM's Biggest Fan Disappointed,"I have been a huge fan of the Dave Matthews Band since I first heard them perform in Charleston, SC in 1992. I've seen them in concert in Charlotte, Nantucket, Chicago and New York several times in the last 10 years and needless to say, they ROCK! However, I am VERY disappointed with their new album, Everyday. The band typically tours with a song for a year before recording it, and it was evident upon listening to the album for the first time that Dave threw together some unpassionate lyrics, added an electric guitar and recorded. There is honestly not one song on the album that is particulary melodious or memorable.Will continue to support the band in its efforts and hope that their next album makes up for this one."
1,"This album is by the record label, not the artist","I've been a DMB fan since before they were popular, and this is the album that I refused to let people play on my stereo in college. First of all, the cover makes me want to throw up in my mouth. Some of the songs are alright, but the whole album has a feel that leaves a bad taste in my mouth (again my vomit) DMB wanted to put out Lillywhite Sessions, but it was too ""real"" and ""good."" So they forced the band to record an entire new album of dull, watered down crap that turned into this album. Luckily, the forces of evil were thwarted and more people downloaded Lillywhite than bought this album."
3,"Bad by DMB standards, but good for anybody else","A previous reviewer said that they were upset that track 2 seemed to end in a weird way and thought it was a manufacturing defect. It's not. I saw the DMB live and they played that song and they ended it the same way they do on the album, which was actually pretty cool. It's not an error, just a creative ending.Overall this album was too electric and the violin and saxophone players don't do enough. I personally think they should go back to Lillywhite and leave Glen Ballard behind. The album has some really good tunes, but it's too comercial."
2,Defects on Tracks 2 and 3,"I have found one glaring defect on this album. I exchanged my first purchase for a second cd which had the same errors. Track 2 ends prematurely with Dave being cut off in the midst of saying 'beginning'. The track ends with begin and then jumps to track 3. I also have found some sound engineering flaws at the beginning of track 3 as well. I can let go of the minor errors on track 3, but the error on track 2 leaves me scratching my head. How does something like this go unnoticed before mass production of a compact disc?"
2,only slipup i've seen from dmb,"with little to no pessimism or doubts about the ability and loaded potential that DMB holds as they head into the coming years, i think Everyday is an unfortunate slipup and if anything an experimentation with a forced and awkward style that's seemingly brought in more for marketing than for inspiration. The hope I'm left with is that the band will evolve through music that is willfully theirs, more like the Lillywhite and Busted Stuff tracks, and every recording made prior to Everyday. A few listenable songs but nothing making it worthy of a new purchase."
2,ummmmm alright,"Lets see, some songs are alright, I mean Everyday is fine, but the over playation of the space between and i did it got annoying. The older music and style of DMB is awesome, but when Glen Ballard had to step in and produce this album things changed. in my opinion they went downhill. i say go for crash, before this crowded streets etc. but lemme tell you i cant wait for the new ""busted stuff"" with some lillywhite session material its gonna ROCK"
2,Their worst CD,"DMB is definitely my favorite band, but this CD was a major let-down. I think most people who love the band (not just those who like it) like the fact that their main instruments are a violin, a sax, and an accustic guitar. It gives their music a sound like no other band. This album is nicely polished and could very well sell better than all the others... but those who are fans of Under the Table and Dreaming will find this album boring. There certainly are good songs, but nothing so amazing that you will still listen to it 5 years from now.Here's hoping they fire their new producer and get back with their old one."
1,A sad departure from a magical sound,"Unfortunately, this cd (and the new direction the Dave Matthews Band is taking) falls flat. The culmination of a lot of psychological strain, creative energy, and intense emotion has pushed Dave in a new direction, which edges dangerously close to pop. This cd leaves me feeling like his music has been washed in bleach. Gone are the strong eccentricities (like the prominent strains and solos of the violin and saxophone and the melodic sound of the acoustic guitar) of his past cds that truly made his sound unique. There are only remnants of these wonderful eccentricities in his current wave of music. What has replaced these, is the electric guitar - how original. There is really only one song on the new cd that I think is worth listening to, and that would be ""The Space Between."" I would forego buying this cd and download only that song."
1,Buy any other Dave than this one,"This album is terrible. It's noisy, unsexy and simplistic in lyrics. In fact, you will get more romance from a Hallmark card. Witness this line: ""Legs don't work 'cause you want me so bad so you just lie spread."" Women don't like to think of themselves as ""spread,"" Dave. That is locker room talk at best. Dave Matthews Band has distinguished itself on all other albums and in concert with long violin and saxophone solos, extremely erotic lyrics and, to me, a lot of foreign influence in the music which had always kept things interesting until this album. If you have not heard much of the band's music and buy this album, you will probably not like the band. I suggest you buy any other album they have done, or any other album in the world. I have had a listen to their new music that is not released yet, and it is great. So buy an older cd or just wait for another to be released. But do not waste your hard-earned dough on this one."
1,"""Bye"", this album","This just doesn't compare with any other DMB albums at all. A few reviewers are stumped as to why people are trashing this album. They are the blind majority of people who don't know real music from commercial mass market garbage if it stared them in the face. Buy any or all previous works by DMB but by all means, stay away from this disaster."
3,What's next? A Britney Spears duet?,"As a huge DMB fan I looked forward to Everyday from the day I found out about it to the day I got it. But what I heard was a disappointment. The songs are catchy and fine if you want to listen to something that doesn't require a lot of thinking, but I like my Dave a little deeper than that. Glen Ballard brought this group down from the great musicianship it has proven itself to be and replaced it with polished bubblegum pop that blends in perfectly with the teenybopper hits that dominate MTV. I always expect more from this band, and I know that their next effort will be worth listening to. So please. Will the real Dave Matthews please stand up?"
3,Not the real dave.,"a'yo people. you want a REAL opinion? how about that of a REAL dmb fan. now i'm not going to compare credentials here, i haven't been a fan since matthews was born for... sake. so to anyone who happened to see the video on trl when they were searching for britney spears or backstreat boys and said ""ooh, i did it, i can remember that title, i can sing the lyrics, they're not that tough, the beats catchy"" we dont' want ur business. the REAL fans out there know about the songs that were supposed to be on the album. busted stuff, grey street, grace is gone, bartender raven, need i go on? those are the real songs. mother, father is a solid track, as well as everyday, and so right. those are the only songs as a hardcore dmb fan that i love. i like one or two others, and think the rest sound like dave matthews playing with vertical horizon... i hope he goes back to his old mellow style."
2,this is not Dave Matthews BAND!,"this is like a Dave Matthews solo album his ""band"" is mostly wasted as just backup studio musicians. the album is very hit (""fool to think"", ""if i had it all"", ""the space between"", and ""when the world ends"")or miss (""I Did It"", ""What You Are"", ""Sleep to Dream Her""). ""I Did It"" is probably the WORST song on the album and I really can't believe it is getting so much radio play! If Dave had let his band play a little more it might have been a better album but instead we get him dominating the songs with his new found electric guitar and a desire to keep the songs short. new comers to the band get Under the Table and Dreaming or Crash 1st. oh and skip Before These Crowded Streets its utter crap this is at least a step up from that pile of dung."
3,"Is there a nice way to say ""sellout""?","I hope this isn't the realm in which DMB is travelling into because I'm going to see them this summer for the first time and I better not hear any of this type junk on stage. I believe ""Angel"" was the best song on the album; in my opinion (which I stress), the rest of the tracks were attempts to slide DMB into mainstream as best they could, while still keeping the music somewhat traditional Dave Matthews Band style. And trying to put tradition into mainstream has never worked and there has never been a better illustration of this trend than ""Everyday."" Don't get me wrong, I like it but just not near as much as ANY other DMB song prior to this. I even like the ""drunk Dave"" song that floated around on Napster more than this album. I hope the live versions of these songs make me like them more or else I may have to sell ""Everyday"" on Ebay. Sorry dave, but I liked hearing Boyd, Leroi, Stefan and Carter just as much as I liked hearing you."
1,Gut-wrenching Disappointment!,"I have loved EVERYTHING dmb has done until now. i own every song the band has ever recorded. after listening to everyday, i have 12 songs too many! i do not have enough room here to adequately explain the sick feeling this album gave me. this effort is simply dave matthews with some back up musicians. gone is the meticulous interaction that was the magic of dmb. this album sounds like some bad electronic music from 1982, i have never heard anything so over-produced in my life. i never thought i would say this, but i will never buy a dmb album without hearing it first again. the illusion that i had of this band being more interested in the quality of their music than their commercial success has proven to be just that, an illusion."
2,bad album,"I am a huge DMB fan, and own every album they have. This is by far the worst album they made. In fact, it probably should have never been released. Some of the songs on the album make great live songs such as what you are and when the world ends but other than that the quality of the album is just not any good. The sound is not classic Dave, which the sound all dave fans know and love. This album is even worse than his brand new release Stand Up."
2,The worst of DMB !,"From the moment I own ""live at luther college"" and found there maybe my favorite album ever, I thought DMB was great. It's not on this terrible album. There are only two good songs (maybe !) ""If I had it all"" and ""The space between"" and I can't listen the others (so annoying, so bad !). FORGET THAT ONE !"
2,ATTENTION: READ BEFORE BUYING EVERYDAY!,i bought this thinking of the great albums dmb has produced. tsk tsk tsk..... horrible. not one song is well crafted. buy other albums from dmb . BUT DEFINATELY NOT THIS ONE. sdont waste your money. im begging you....
3,"""I did It,""and I wish I Didn't buy ""Everyday""","I loved ""Crash,""every one of the cuts from that CD,and I enjoy the single ""The Space Between,""but this record is so Boring,even though its well produced ,and the music sounds great,but I just can't get into this CD.I played it for 5 solid days,and I can't take it anymore.I think The Dave Matthews Band is fantastic,and I would see them in concert even if I had to drive 100miles,but something is wrong with this record."
1,This CD Has Hit Me,"After posting a five star review of this album and praising the band for ""changing"", I listened to Everyday over and over again. But something happened: I realized this CD really, really stinks. I never cared for the Glen Ballard/Dave Matthews pairing at all and now I really hate what Ballard has done. His production WAS magical with Alanis Morissette and now she has decided to go alone for her next record. After hearing Everyday, I don't blame her. Ballard and Matthews have striped the emotion from the songs and have created Backstreet Boy songs which is fine, only that I thought DMB was a ""real"" band. Ballard's previous work with Alanis was Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which is the last thing from ""mainstream"", but his work with Matthews is just that. Why did Dave and his band have to create an album so uninspired and geared towards top 40 radio fans? I was really excited for them to come to my city to play, but that was before this pathetic album hit stores."
3,"Glen Ballard, hitmeister for hire...","My trust in the human condition is shattered. Where are our heroes? Dave Matthews, I assumed, would weather the swirling storm known as pop insanity for at least another day. I was wrong. Enlisting the able assistance of none other than Alanis-scribe Glen Ballard (didn't he also have a generous hand in the hit machine/juggernaut known as Wilson Phillips?), DMB has been reduced in stature. Heroes, where are they? Where have you gone, Joe Dimaggio? Dave Matthews, selling out for radio-friendly jingles? Guilty as charged.Customers who bought this also bought:A laxative"
1,Dave Matthews Everyday doesn't work.,"In the world of sellout rock bands that were good like metallica and Pearl Jam, this is the next thing to cram after this awful cd, Poor plot, lowbrow production values and stereotypically boring scenes that might have been rip-off smash mouth than dave, my best advice for dave and the crew to stick to your guns, because this is not a good cd."
1,What exactly IS their best work?,"This guy is destined to go down in history as one of the most massively popular but worst artists ever (a la Billy Joel). Tailor-made pap for middle-aged, middle-to-upper class (see, we can listen to rock and party, too!) suburbanites. Don yer Dockers and golf shirts, looks like Jimmy Buffet has some competition!"
1,"Terrible, just terrible","Dave Matthews Band: Great musicians playing (awful) music and a short guy who sings through his nose. This cd is the worst of the worst. Then they have about a dozen live albums, ""Listener Supported,"" in which every song sounds the same. Will this band ever go away? Anyone who gains a large audience base and then puts out (a bad album) like ""Everyday"" deserves to be fired. Dave, I don't care what you put out from here on, you are F-I-R-E-D. Power to the musicians, writers and singers who are actually talented."
2,"This cd is good,but anything he has put out before is better","I bought this album the day it came out .When I first listened to it I absolutly hated it.But I did not give up on it yet.After a few days I began to like it. In my modest opinion Everyday is the bands worst album, but it is still good.Thats how good they are.As someone else mentioned the Lillywhite sessions are really good. I would recomend either downloading the album or you can go to ebay.com and bid for a copy of The Lillywhite Sessions.I gave this cd 2 star because it does not live up to any of their other studio albums.The song on Everyday are ""More radio friendly"". I really hope DMB's next album they choose Steve Lillywhite as their producer .Hope this is of some help to you."
3,not the best from dave,"DMB has had some great cd's in the past, but this one just isnt too hot. The hit "" I Did It"" got old to soon by overplaying by the radio... but theyre still some good songs like ""space between""""What you Are"" and ""Angel"". If ur looking for a great CD , i dont recomend it, but if u love DMB, buy it anyway"
4,You'll have to listen more than once,"Being a DMB fan for some years now, I, too, was apprehensive about the new sound. But, I was first in line to buy the album nonetheless. DMB's new produducer, and thus new sound is not the easiest thing to swallow for the typical fan. Obviously, this CD does not have ""#41"" or ""Ants Marching."" After taking this CD home and giving it a quick listen, I'm not going to lie. I was disappointed. The songs seems like they were looking for way to end at 4:30 minutes so they could get play on the radio. I thought that Dave had sold out. BUT, after listening to it more today, I have come to appreciate the new sound. While, I'll still listen to his older albums for his older stuff, I'll surely keep this one in my player for some time to come. If you are a ""TRUE"" DMB fan, get this album! But, I'll warn you, you may have to listen a couple of times to appreciate the new sound."
4,"A Departure, But Retains the DMB Charm","While a departure from what Dave Matthews Band fans are used to, with the previous three studio cuts coming from produce Steve Lillywhite, this new album, ""Everyday"" has it's charms. Dave on the electric is able to create a new sound the compliments the old quite well. Songs such as ""Angel"" and ""The Space Between"" bring the old Charlottesville eclectic tunes with a new version of the energy. Many of the tunes are very catchy and I imagine will see a fair amount of radio play. Overall a very nice album, and while it may seem as too foreign to die-hard DMB fans, I imagine it will slowly grow on even the staunch old believers."
4,a change,"yes, it is a change from the usual dmb -- but change doesn't have to be a bad thing. this cd is incredible!!! i've listened to dave for a long time and they managed to surprise and impress me again."
2,What happened Dave???,"I am a huge fan of DMB. Who knows Dave, mabey you're reading this. I have been to numerous concerts and this band has always managed to keep the same groovy sound. After purchasing ""Under the Table..."", ""Crash"", and ""Before These Crowded Streets"", I could put in the album and listen to it all the way through. I find myself constantly skipping through songs on ""Everyday"". The only 3 songs I would consider listening to again are ""I Did It"", ""The Space Between"", and ""Angel"". There is little (if any acoustic guitar) and no instrumental solos. I would release a live album quick just to overshadow this one. Dave, take my advise and go back to the basics with your next album......"
2,Everyday sounds very much like everyday music,"This album was written half by Dave, and half by Glenn Ballard: THE PRODUCER! This is why the rest of the band sounds like they are just studio musicians. Usually the band writes their own part, but on this one the part was written for them. Overall this album is O.K., but I was very disappointed by the fact that Dave finally sold out..."
3,Not the Typical DMB sound,"This album is probably the most famous DMB album out there simply because of it's strange history with the Lillywhite Sessions, etc. It's not a typical sound for the band, but they do have a few gems on here that you aren't likely to hear otherwise."
5,Annoyed with Criticisms,"I know most of the hardcore DMB fans criticize this cd, but for me this was the cd that finally got me into the band. There was just something about Dave's screw the world attitude on ""I Did It"" that drew me in. I couldn't resist listening to more. ""When the World Ends"" is another edgy song on the album, ""The Space Between"" is a beautiful song, ""Everyday"" is a little different from most of the songs on the cd because it's more positive and upbeat, but I love it. Some of my other favorites are ""If I Had is all,"" ""Fool to Think,"" and ""Mother Father."" The one problem I can see is the cd doesn't fully use the talents of the other members of the band, but it's still a five star album."
1,If you have money to burn...,"I love the DMB but this just wasn't worth the money. Don't get me wrong I love their music and I suppose I wanted to ""collect them all"" but this changed my mind about that idea. I'm actually upset that saved up for this. Forget about this import and just save your money for the next album."
1,Review for a friend...,"One of my friends trying to sell his copy of Everyday. When desperation turns funny:""Dave Matthews and Glen Ballard create a steaming pile of pop on Everyday. I can't bear to have this musical abhorrence sitting in my collection anymore. Please buy this, I don't care if I lose money on it. I'll even foot the bill on shipping costs. Buyer can have the album shipped pre-scratched and broken, or opt to do it him/herself once they hear this terrible recording. If you like this awful album, see also other peoples' auctions for more bland modern rock albums, such as Creed, Nickelback, and Matchbox 20 (sorry, ""twenty""). As it stands, it's in excellent condition, and has only been listened to one and a half times. I accept check, money order, and paypal.""It's funny because all of it is true. Avoid like antrax."
4,Mythic fantasy at its very best,"Michael Scott Rohan weaves a fascinating tale over his trilogy. This first book introduces his world and shows the apprenticeship of a young man into the Smith craft.It's clear that Mr. Rohan did his homework on the details of smithing, and it's very wonderful to be there and watch the learning process. The story has mythic resonance in spades - mirroring the Hero's Journey in many ways, but not so much that you notice it heavily.What I loved about this tale is that the main character clearly changes throughout the story arc. There is romance, there is fantasy, but it isn't overwhelming.I recommend this book (and the series) because it brings out ancient wisdom and gives you a sense that you are connected to another time and world"
