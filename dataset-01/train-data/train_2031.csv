2,1st Generation Zune - Not even close,"I've owned a 1st generation 30gb Zune since the first of 2008. I've applied all available software/firmware updates. It has more working against it than for it. But I use it everyday because I don't want to risk losing my iPod Touch.The main complaints are the horrible software; the USB 1.1 transfer speed (takes literally hours to load movies); the lack of any ability to organize videos in any way and songs only into basic groups; the way it doesn't remember where you left off while listening to songs in a very long list; no way to delete files from collection but keep in player (deletes without asking when re-connecting); scrolling and more scrolling, clicking and more clicking (no shortcuts).It's not all bad: Good audio quality; video is passable but nowhere near the Touch; good size and comfort; good battery.Like I said, this is my everyday player but if I didn't have my iPod to fall back on, I'd be disappointed."
1,typical Microsoft,"As if they've had an original idea in their head (they haven't, 95% of all they do is just blatantly bad ripoff of Apple products and software), they came out with this worthless hunk of junk. It's 3rd rate joke of Apple-wannabe marketing copy does go well with it's 3rd rate piece of Apple-wannabe hardware which has 3rd rate Apple-wannabe software that may install, will probably crash, and certainly installs M$ malware and can be used by others to program other trojan horses into your machine. By the best (an iPod) or be laughed at by friends.Looking forward to this waste of plastic joining the Dell (speaking of crappy Apple imitators) DJ in the graveyard of so many who try to, but fail miserably, to imitate the best. Good riddance."
5,ZUNE IS THE WAY!!,"Zune rocks!! Future versions will get smaller and thinner and more powerful. This is an excellent start, though! I hope Amazon's UNBOX will be fully compatible with this device."
2,It's whatever....,"I didn't like it much. I used to have an iRiver that I loved. The reasons I don't like the Zune are: 1.) It doesn't have a customizable EQ. The sound that came out of this player was pretty bland. No high crisp bass even with the right earplugs. 2.) I hate the annoying program I have to use just to upload music or other files. It's a needless step in my opinion. I'd rather it be a drag and drop hard-drive player, cutting out the middleman program just to load your music. 3.) Battery life isn't at all long enough.The only reasons I gave it 2 stars is that the Zune really is easy to use. The buttons do what they're supposed to do and scrolling around looking for the song you want is super easy. Another reason is the fact that it really does have a pretty screen, I'll give it that. The photos and videos are vibrant in color."
5,Zune 30 GB,I ordered my ZUNE from Yahoo and couldn't be happier. It was shipped right away and works great. Im so happy I didn't get sucked into the IPOD hype. Thank you YAHOO and MICROSOFT. ~ Ted
5,microsoft zune,"had some issues with shipping. but once i got the product the product works great, easy to use."
5,Great Product,This is the best MP3 player around the song selection is the same as i-tunes the features are great and the look is sleek
5,awesome!,i actually got the brown 80gb zune for 89.95 on here about 8 months ago. it works fine and i have not seen anything cheaper then this so far. great buy and good delivery
1,This is going back today,"I wanted to get a media player so that I could download pod casts. I did not have another media player prior to this so I could not compare it. I have spent 6 hours on this and at this point it is going back.First there are no instructions. I had to play around with it for about 4 hours to finally figure out how the thing worked. I though I could go to the Zune web site for help. No such luck, you have to go to the messages boards and sign on to access data.The Zune was adding data onto it from the web site that I did not want, such as music I would never listen to. From what I could figure out, music from my computer has to go to the Zune site, then downloaded to the Zune. I thought this would just be a drag and drop operation, but if it was, I never could figure it out. I could not just pick an album on my computer and drop it to the Zune. At this point I am so frustrated I am ready to throw my computer across the room. I hate this product."
4,Good,the Zune is a very good product. to me it is diffrent from the I Pods and that is the reason i like about it. I would recommend this product to any one who just want to take their music with them
1,Fair to Middling at Best,"For the same price, you get better value from an iPod. Yes, the iPod has a slightly smaller screen. It also is thinner and has a longer lasting battery. When the screen is held up, the size isn't that big of a difference, and it's the same pixel resolution.Microsoft is attempting to mimic the iPod ecosystem, but you can't just go out and buy a song for 99 cents. You have to buy it in points, and one point does not equal one penny. At least with the Wii point system, you don't get confused on how much money you've spent.Sharing is so slow that there isn't much point. By the time you share a song with someone, you'd be better off just letting them borrow your Zune for three minutes.Yeah, yeah. People think the iPod is overpriced and overhyped. I have to say that it really isn't. When you pick up and use an iPod, it screams quality. The Zune just does not."
2,Love Zune but...,"I am a Zune lover mainly because I hate itunes. I bought this Zune 30 GB used because I already had a great newer Zune and lost it. When I got this one I was pretty disappointed. It's kind of big and clumsy by today's standards. On top of that the music quality I'm getting out of the this model isn't as good as on the newer Zune (I know that's hard to believe but certain instruments or vocals are really quiet on some songs...it's weird). My advice, don't buy this used. Go with a newer nicer Zune for a little more money and enjoy the fact that Microsoft has made a legit alternative to the ipod."
1,"Not ""like new""","This product was advertised as ""Like new"", but upon receiving it I found out that it will not stay functional for more than 5 minutes at a time, restarting in the middle of songs on a regular basis, IF it plays the songs at all. Complete. Failure."
4,Fast Delivery,I was very satisfied with quick delivery. I was hoping it was atleast bubbles wrapped but it doesn't seem there is anything wrong with it.....yet ;)
4,A great player - and easily an excellent alternative players,"I actually really love this thing! Everything works as it should and the screen is the reason I bought this. It's great to watch videos and movies on this. I also have an Ipod, but I am giving that to my wife. Videos and pictures look way better on the Zune, and the navigation is easier to use than the Ipod. Surprisingly, the sound quality out of the Zune is better than my Ipod too.The software that runs with the Zune is good but it will be great when their music catalog is more up to speed with the number of tracks available in Itunes. The Zune software is not as good as the Zune itself - yet. Sync works great for music, video, and pictures."
2,iPod is better!!!!,"I received this Zune as a Christmas gift. After 4-6 months it shut down completely. I sent it back to Zune for repair, which took 2 months! I have had nothing but problems with it for 2 years. Battery life is ok, but the apps are seriously lacking. Ever since the Zune HD came out, apps are impossible to get for this Zune. iPod has thousands of apps! Save your time and money and go with iPod."
1,Do not buy this!,"When it did work, for about 6 months, it lost my music, duplicated music so I had 2 of almost every song, some songs couldn't even be deleted. Then when I tried to update the firmware it just stopped working all together. I tried calling customer service a couple of times and that got me no where, just wasted hours of my time. I asked if I could just ship it out to be fixed, they denied my request and gave me a couple of article numbers to look up so that I could continue to spend my time fixing this product. Just stay away from Zune, not only did microsoft make a poor product, it doesn't even stand behind it. This is one big headache not worth the trouble."
1,"Nice player, but no one else has one for me to social with","Bought the Zune just as it came out. I was kinda pissed at Apple because my iPod went dead (dropped it) and after getting no satisfaction at the Apple store I thot Zune would offer a couple advantages and maybe better service. I don't live in a big city, but lots of peeps here are PC oriented (I live around a lot of defense contractors and military bases) and I thot that someone would have a zune in the mall or downtown and I could swap some tunes and maybe - dare I say- meet a girl. Long story short- NOBODY, I mean nobody has a zune that I could find. And what's up with the Zune Marketplace? Geez, iTunes is so freggin' easy to use, I got addicted to it and my parents got pissed off that I was D/Ling albums and videos.I'm putting my Zune on eBay and will be forced to buy another ipod (without the HD) - who needs 80 gigs of storage for crying out load?"
5,Great Product,"I bought the Zune for a discounted price because I think the regular retail is way too high. I've had the Zune for a year and except for the New Years Eve glitch, the player has worked great for me. I bought a Altec Lansing docking system for the Zune as well as the Zune Car Pack so I have all the accessories I need to listen to it without the headphones. I also purchased the AC charger which seems to charge the unit faster than using the USB cord and laptop."
4,What is with the price tag? Is this a joke?,Dear Amazon - is this a joke? You have the 120GB for $235 and the 30GB 1st Gen Zune for $399!!!Sorry created a review for this so that other customers can see this.Hope Amazon corrects this mistake!
1,Great...as long as it works,Works great...as long as it works. Bought 2 exactly same. Both broke in just over 1 year. Better buy a warranty. Personally I will buy I-Pod next time.
4,Almost perfect,"The things I like about this are, Very impressive menu navigation, Great sound quality, very good video quality. That was almost what I was looking for."
4,A few problems,"Pros: Nice video quality, cool scrolling, fairly easy program for transferring music, great price for the space & quality.Cons: I am not 100% sure, but so far it's like every other player in that, if a song says it's a certain album, it will list the artists by however the song is programmed to consider it. Even after modifying the files in the program they don't sync properly on the device.I don't like that a lot of my music videos didn't sync, which I assume is a compatibility issue.You can't do much, anything really, from the device itself. You have to do all your modifications in the program. I like the auto-sync but it can become a pain since you add songs to the program from folders. So you can't just put one or two songs on without putting them into a folder.Most of this is pretty much universal mp3 player problems but it's too bad they weren't addressed."
3,Zune 30 gig,I am comming around to like the Zune after a somewhat long learning curve. Being used to using another MP3 Apple product required some adjustments. I do like the art that is attached to my MP3 files and old songs that are saved on my computer. Winter time static electricity really affects the Zune in a major way that I did not experience with my Ipod from Apple. At work when I do not have time to stop this is a problem. A static charge will reboot the Zune requiring I stop and search for the spot I was at in a 3 hour recorded radio show. It is almost useless during these times when it is cold and dry.
4,Zune 30gb,"So far so good. My wife is enjoying her new toy. I think the bulk of our CD collection if not the entire collection has been ripped ans synced up to her Zune. I will post if I run into any technical problems with the product.The price I paid for this amount of storage vs. buying the name ""IP_D"" was well worth the money and cheaper too!"
5,Zune is an awesome product!!,"I absolutely LOVE the Zune! I had originally asked for an IPOD and my husband chose to get me a ZUNE; and I am so happy he knew what he was looking for! I love the fact that it has Radio and Video! I LOVE it!I have it on 24/7! I am not a techy, but the ZUNE is easy to use and program! I would highly recommend this product!!"
1,Support Universal by buying this product. Even if you never put music on it.,"A portion of the sale of each Zune goes to Universal. This is a terrible precedent. Also, unlike Apple, Microsoft is likely to bow down to industry wishes for variable pricing for individual tracks and albums. The Zune is the product the music industry wants you to have. The iPod is the product YOU want to have."
2,Got one as a gift (wish I could give it back),"After having three ipods, I really wasn't looking for a Zune but a friend who likes Microsoft a lot bought me one for Christmas. With friends like this I don't need enemies. This product is terrible. Buying music is a problem because you buy points that apply to the music and it's just not straight forward.The sound quality of the player is adequate but otherwise it is a poor wannabe ipod. The case is like it was made by tupperware and the software it integrates with on the PC is crashprone and just flat out doesn't work.Run don't walk away from the Zune!"
1,D.O.A.,"How could a company with as much software experience as Microsoft make such a terrible user experience? The Zune as a device is OK. The Zune experience (music store, points, ridiculous wi-fi/DRM garbage, etc) is so, so bad it's almost unbelievable.Why not just copy Apples model exactly? Or better yet why not just buy an iPod?"
2,Software is too buggy!!!,"Can't believe Microsoft released this crap software. The software was a real pain for me. Now my Zune software has trouble seeing the Zune player. Apparently other people are having the same problem as me reading the complaints in the internet. Even if i don't have this connectivity problem, I would still feel like beta tester for the Zune. You're gonna have problems if you reinstall Windows, reinstall Zune, or install the software on another computer. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! I regret buying this crap. Go for the Ipod or Sandisk Sansa."
1,LCD Screen Cracked,"I bought a 30 GB Zune for my grandson for Christmas. I read the reviews and was concerned about the software issues at first. To my surprise the software installation was a snap. In FEB 2008 I called Zune support and told them that the LCD looked like it was cracked but there was no external damage. Support told me that Zune would not warranty a cracked LCD under any circumstances, they also would not give me any information on how to access factory repair. The C.S. repersenative was rude and not at all helpful. Online I checked some of the independant repair companies and found out that Zune has a problem with LCD's cracking if charged overnight. It seems that the battery heats up and expands causing the LCD to crack. Microsoft is aware of this problem but they are sticking to thier NO REPLACEMENT POLICY. I wish Amazon would help on this matter. Buyers BEWARE, ZUNE has a problem and they won't address it."
1,"Zero Stars! If you are a Mac user, forget about it.","I almost bought one. Loved reading about all the features. Actually had a box in my hand, ready to purchase, then read the system requirements (the Zune box was the only place I found these). Windows only! Alas I am a Mac user, and it absolutely does not work with a Mac. Nice planning, Microsoft! Just thought you'd like to know, since that fact is not prominently featured in most reviews and there are millions of Mac users who might have otherwise purchased the Zune. Guess I'll get an iPod after all. It is possible that I am a completely blind lunatic and missed this somewhere. If that's the case, I'm sure someone will point this out to me promptly. But before trudging off to purchase it, I read many reviews and checked the product description and technical details here on Amazon. I didn't see any system requirements listed. Pretty important detail to leave out, don't you think?"
4,Nice,"Pros: Looks great, very durable. Holds a TON. Software is fairly easy to use. Lets you chose your background. A fairly long battery life. Large screen.Cons: So freakin Proprietary. Does not support drag and drop or windows media player so to upload you HAVE to install the zune software. Does not support avi format so you have to convert anything you want to put on it. Also forget any songs you bought on windows market place because it will not recognize them. Does not connect with internet or comp over wifi and only supports uploads from zune to zune and those only last for 3 plays or 3 days.It takes a while to get used to flipping the screen sideways to view movies but it is worth it. I make it all sound bad but look again at my rating. It has a lot of cons but the Ipod has many of the same so overall, I like it. The only one I think MAY be better is the Zen M but that has a smaller screen and is thicker."
4,"Good, but not perfect","Pros- Nice screen, scratch resistant casing, looks good, fm radio, customizable background.Cons- wireless is uselss, screen resolution same as ipod.Great buy for 200 bucks."
5,An excellent product.,"I have owned the zune for about two weeks now, and honestly I have no complaints. At first I was a little hesitant to purchase it, having read some nasty reviews. I took the chance though, and was well rewarded. I had no issues installing the software, the battery life is great, and the quality of the sound is amazing. Video play is wonderful as well, and the radio is a very nice touch."
2,WORKS TIL PROGRAM FAILS THEN BUY A NEW COMPUTER,"i HAVE 3 ZUNE PLAYER ALL REALLY WORK, IT'S JUST THE COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR ZUNECRASHED ON BOTH MY COMPUTER THAT RUN WITH WINDOWS XP.TRY AS YOU MIGHT YOU WILL NOT GET THE PROGRAM TO WORK AGAINYOU CAN NOT ERASE THE OLD ONE AND NOTHING HELPS. SO I AM BUYINGA NEW COMPUTER JUST TO RUN ZUNE( GOOD TRICK MICROSOFT).IF YOU DO HAVE ZUNE WORKING NEVER UPLOAD UPGRADES FOR ZUNE.I EXPECT A FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT SEE FOR YOURSELF THERE HASBEEN NONE FOR YEARS!!!"
1,Disappointing...buyer beware,"I thought I'd try Zune because I didn't feeling wasting money on Ipod...Maybe this line of technology isn't where it needs to be yet...The Zune, and it's associated software has potential, but doesn't live up to expectations. The Zune software/marketplace will drive you crazy with its consistency. Your ability to download and burn music is entirely dependent on the whims of the software at that particular moment...I'm terribly disappointed. Another crappy product care of the corporate Nazis at Microsoft."
1,OMG Its rubbish,I have use many mp3 players and omg this is the absolute pits.1.The interface is awful (I actually had to create playlists and put music on my freinds one)2.It doesn't accept much music (In europe) without obtaining it illegally.3.The bundled software is WOW Bad seriously.4.Sound quality is below average5.It is massive (I seriously couldn't fit it in most of my trouser pockets)I now use a 5G ipod 30GB. I never actually owned one of these but borrowed it from a freind for a few months for a test run and was greatly disappointed. He doesn't know much about audio quality so he's happy and besides what he doesn't know won't hurt him. I am not an apple fanboy by any means because I am in the process of getting a cowon iAudiowhich is supposed to be very good. I am just giving my view and am trying to advise anybody considering this product to avoid it at all costs.
2,It is not what it looks.,"I got the black zune when it came out because Windows is my favorite company. It was performing really well except the battery life. It's not that long. Also the screen scratches easily. After a few months, I dropped my zune and boom, my zune died. Although the zune looks really durable and strong, there's something on the bottom of the zune that breaks really easily, killing the whole thing. $250 down the drain. The best MP3 is probably the Zen. I haven't heard any complaints from Zen customers. The Ipod freezes frequently after a long time."
1,"Does not work with Macs, iTunes, or your new car","Crazy. Everyone uses iTunes because it rocks, excuse the pun, and has the exact same features on PC as it has on Macs, but this Zune does not work with iTunes, even on the PC. Doesn't work with my Mac either. Nor does it work in my car which has an iPod connector as most do these days. Not really a viable option beyond some marketing guy's white board. Maybe the next one will address these bugs."
5,Microsoft Zune,i am very pleased with the microsoft zune.it is so much better than an ipod.plus the software it comes with for your computer makes burning and ripping cds so much faster.
5,large capacity and easy to download music and videos,I bought this zune for my friend because he had windows application with windows media player and thought it would be easier for him to download music and video than the ipod. I was right! he really likes it. He has been able to download alot of his music and video collections and still has plenty of available space left. The price that was offered by Amazon was the best around for the same exact unit other stores were selling. This was a great buy!
2,Typical Microsoft,"I agree that the Zune has a good look about it, though a bit heavy and thick (as others have mentioned). I tried using the software that came with it, downloaded the upgrade of the software. Didn't sync well at all or it did partially. As a well-seasoned Microsoft user (now Vista) I decided to use Windows Media Player (as it said on the MP panel). After being very excited about that initially ... that didn't work either. I went online only to see what experience others had. After reading several not-so-flattering blogs from others trying to find a way for this thing to work, I finally found a way to solve my problem. I went to the workshop and took out a hammer and applied it to the Zune. No more problem. It was in a funny way very therapeutic. I think we both felt better as both of us were out of our misery. I went and got an iPod Classic. Not a single problem with that. Stay clear of anything Microsoft. I'm now a convert to Apple."
4,Zune MP3 Player,"I love my new Mp3 player, but would like a owners manuel to go with it, I am new at this and have no idea how the buttons work. I did not recieve a instruction manuel to show me how to use my devise. It is trial and error, I keep loosing my songs that I have downloaded, because I don't know what buttons to use."
1,"Run, Don't Walk....To Return this one for a refund!","Total Disaster...good luck getting the software onto your computer. even more challenging may be getting the actual player to charge or work. after spending hours downloading every possible microsoft update, the zune still believes it's not compatible with either my home or office equipement. without a doubt this is one of the worst products i've ever purchased."
4,Works well and is a good value,"The Zune 30GB is a very good value. It is easy to use. It integrates with Windows Vista very well. Sharing photos and songs wirelessly is fun, although shared songs do expire after three plays. I only have two problems with it: 1) Battery life is too short. 2) If you delete a song or photo from your PC hard drive, the Zune software automatically deletes the file from your Zune player the next time you sync. And one more word to the wise: Having two Zunes on one PC is a challenge. The easiest way to manage this is to sync everything manually, and that's time consuming. But over all, I recommend it, especially considering the low price."
4,Trying to decide on a hard drive based MP3 player? Then look no further than the Zune.,"I immensely enjoy my Microsoft 30 GB Zune MP3 player. It is definitely much better than the iPod Nano that I used to have. Maybe it is because of the amount of songs I can fit on here, but it was cheaper than the current iPod nano's, so this is worth it. I saw a lot of complaints about the software, and while I did have some trouble with it, I just restarted my PC and I was good to go. I haven't encountered any problems since then. Navigating is easy for the player itself. My only complaints are:The battery life which is way shorter than advertisedWhen I turn it back on after turning it off it starts all over again. I liked the nano in which I could turn it on and it would be in the middle of a song right where I stopped it, thus letting my shuffle continue going.But I would say if you want a relatively cheap MP3 player with lots of space, get this."
4,Zune 30gb Media Player,"Very good media player. Good video and sound quality, make sure to encode media in native formats (wmv, wma, etc..) or file transfer will take a long time. Nice that Microsoft allowed customers to update to new firmware (adding improvements). The wifi feature is pretty much useless, it lets you send files to other zune owners quickly and easily, but they can only play the file a few times or keep it a few days then it expires. Software typical Microsoft = good and bad, Ok once you learn to work with it."
1,Wait For The Next Generation,I have owned 2 iPods and now a Zune. I have always refused to buy the first year/generation of any product. First year/generation models are always buggy. I broke that rule and bought the Zune. I should have waited. The tonal quality does not approach that of a 5th generation iPod. The battery life on an iPod is far superior as well. The wheel does not work nearly as smoothly as an iPod either. The Zune was a good idea but it was not ready to go to market. I assume that if Christmas were not fast approaching they would have waited and improved the Zune a bit more before releasing it. They should have anyway. I gave mine to my sister yesterday and went back to my old iPod. When I can afford a new purchase I will get a 60 or 80 gig iPod video. Buyer beware.
3,it works...,"Well, this is my first mp3 player but i had researched other products extensively and this was presented to me as the ""best' out right now and I beg to differ...not greatly differ but it is just an okay item.The software is undeniably terrible. I mean, what is the use of video capability when they don't offer video support? it converts shows on itunes and if i had known that i would have asked my mom for the ipod.Secondly, the battery life is short. I can listen to it all day but if i don't put it on the charger THAT NIGHT i am not going to be able to use it the next day. it just seems like i have it on the charger all the time.The mp3 player, as far as size, design, function is concerned is okay. a good sized screen. it plays music. i got what i paid for. But if ur looking for something reputable don't buy this...not the first generation ""ginuea pig"" ones anyway"
1,Microsoft Junk,Software for this player is horrible. Somehow during the sync process my entire song collection (3700 songs) got erased from my hard drive. I can only assume that there must be a virus embedded in the program. Stupidly I had not backed up these files. It took me a week to reinstall my music. I took a chance and ran Sync again and it worked. Since I never intend to Sync again I will keep the product. Any more problems and I will use my small sledgehammer to fix it.
2,Stuck with it,"I got this as a gift for someone. I first brought one for my sister when they first came out and she had no problems with it but this time around the one I purchased off of Amazon seemed to shut off on its on while playing. I sent in for a replacement and the replacement wouldn't even turn on so instead of returning the first one with ""auto shut-off"" I had to send in the replacement. Now my friend is stuck with a zune that works sometimes when it wants to.-Thanks Amazon"
3,It's Okay,"This device was received in a timely manner. I bought this as an anniversary gift for my boyfried because he is a truck driver and I wanted him to be able to watch movies when his television is not working properly in various cities. It is very, very, very hard to download movies to the zune. I am a little upset because that's why I bought. Zune's music site has a lot of music but you have to pay for them which is a bommer. But you can sync the music you already have on your computer. He has two movies on the Zune right now and I can' tell you how long it took or how I did it. I tried various software conversions, it was very tiresome. I can't seem to be able to download anymore. Now my computer is now showing the zune screen, and I have deleted and reinstalled the software several times. But I used my sister's computer and downloading is just very difficult."
3,Broke after a month...Do not use lock switch,"Not bad for an mp3 player, but the lock switch broke, only after a month. Have to send it in to get fixed, which will take 3 weeks. One other thing, batter life is not the greatest. I manage to get 5 to 6 hours of just listening to music with it."
5,The Best Mp3 player.,"This is the best mp3 player i ever had, it plays, almost everything, mp3, wma, wmv, mov, mp4 with excellent quality of sound.And a decent plus is the radio and you can customize the background.It plays the video with an amazing speed, and quality.Very Satisfied with product."
4,zune player,I purchased this product for a birthday present. He likes it very much. I recieved it several days before I was supposed to. I would definitely order from this company again.
3,Shall I compare thee to an iPod?,"The Zune is a decent player. The OS is easy to use and intuitive. It does what you expect it to do. Its sound quality is at par with an iPod. However, it carries all the drawbacks of an iPod as well. The biggest problem I have with this player and unfortunately, the iPod as well is that I HAVE to use their proprietary software to synchronize/transfer media. This was the reason I never bought an overpriced iPod... or a Zune (mine was given to me as a present). Consequently, I ended up using the Radio function on this quite a bit. If you are considering an iPod, i would definitely suggest the Zune as a strong contender. If you are looking for something beyond the ordinary and mundane, I would look elsewhere... a Creative Zen perhaps...Creative Zen X-Fi 32 GB Video MP3 Player with Wireless LAN and Built-In Speaker (Black/Silver)Also, on this version of the Zune, the Wi-Fi function is worse than useless."
4,Who needs an Ipod?,"This is my first MP3 player and I love it! It may be larger than others - but I come from the generation that first had the Walkman and thought that was tiny, so this is small enough for me. I strapped this on my arm last week and listened to my old rock n roll collection while I cleaned the garage. Ahhhhhh - the Who! The software was very easy to use, it practically does everything itself - you just plug it in at the right time and place. I would recommend it for anyone. 30 gigs is a whole lot of storage. The price was better than anything comparable."
4,Zune 30GB,"Wonderful. All the features are amazing. I upgraded from a Dell DJ to a Zune media player. After spending months of looking at ipod and others Zune is the one I chose. I recommend Zune to all. Also, it really is easy to share music!"
2,Microsoft has abandoned this product.,"I bought this product at release. And it plays music well,but Microsoft has not put out any updates for this thing since the first couple of months. The marketplace is the worse software i've ever used. And with a screen this size,you would think they would have video. Instead you have to buy pricey 3rd party software to put video on it. No podcast no video no movies or tv shows on the marketplace. Well made player but crappy marketplace. Stay far away from this."
5,IPOD CAN'T COMPARE TO THIS!!!!!!!!,"Everything about the zune is better than the ipod.First, it is better organized. I can easily find the song I want to play.Second, THE SCREEN IS HUGEThird, the sound is WAY better than the Ipod'sFourth, the Zune's version of ""Itunes"" automatically finds all songs, videos, and pictures on your computer and adds them to your library. You don;t need to searh for them like Itunes...Fifth - It has radiosixth - You can wirelessly share music, pictures, and videos between zunes.seventh - It looks cooler!A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
2,"Hmmm, very deceiving","Well I was very excited to buy this anti i-pod product because I am not a very big fan of apple, but I do love to listen to music and want something that can fit my entire collection. But immediately when I started downloading the software for the Zune, I was met with unfortunate results. Every time I started downloading the software it hit an error message and told me to reboot and try again. Next try same thing, after about an hour or so I go to there official website, no help there. And now I have decided that this player would be a lot better if it supported easier plug and play compatibility's. Bill gates..... you sure dropped the ball on this one. The only reason that it got 2 stars is because I have seen this thing at a friends house (and it was working) And I do know that this can be a truly amazing piece of hardware. Right now I am leaving to take this back to my local store."
2,Not comparable to a touch,"I bought this because it was an MP3 player with wi-fi, I thought it would be a good alternative to my iPod touch and I could give that to my apple loving brother. I had no idea your getting useless wifi with no keyboard or touchscreen. So you can't access the internet at all. Why give a product wi-fi if it can't be used for internet browsing? I think iPod is an overly expensive brand; and there is no reason this wouldn't be better than an iPod nano or shuffle; but the iPod touch is actually useful at places that offer wi fi, like McDonald's or Starbucks if you need information off of the internet. (email, directions, get a hotel, make a phone call with skype) Do not buy this product as a competitor for an iPod touch, buy it as a mp3 player you can get cheaply; closest comparison is to Sony Walkman."
4,Solid,"I got mine for $99 dollars so it's impossible not to be satisfied. But, I have to say the software is pretty good and video quality is excellent."
1,Broken Product,"The seller said I would be receiving a refurbished Zune, you know, one that WORKS. I get it. It's fine. It turns on, it's empty, everything seems in order. I download the Zune software from the internet because the device did not come with such, and then the Zune starts rebooting. It will not get out of reboot mode. I researched this issue on the internet and apparently they sent me a Zune with a corrupted hard drive that will not work in the updated mode. I only used it for one day. One day.Don't buy anything from this seller. I just wasted about 100 bucks."
5,love all my zunes!,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it. Nothing fancy, just an easy way to play your favorite tunes and look at nice pictures. I have one and so does my oldest son and we love them all. Only my snobby daughter loves her ipod, ewww!lol"
3,It plays music,Pros- Good player- Durable- Cheap- Sound quality is goodCons- Got a bit buggy after a year or two of use- Battery life was short
2,Here is another one I didn't buy from Amazon.,"Got it five years ago at navy exchange in Honolulu.It is okay for what it does, but I don't use it much."
4,"Zune is very good, but not great",The bottom line:PROS:1. solid feel2. very good sound quality3. Can display jpg images as a background on the screen4. large screen5. 30GB storage6. includes good songs and videos. I really like CSS. Just found out about them because of the Zune.7. Less scratchable than the IpodCons1. No direct podcast subscription support via software ( I still need to use Itunes)2. a little big3. Wifi needs to do more! ...like connect to the internet4. No direct podcast subscription support via software ( I still need to use Itunes).....I already said that....but it is worth repeating.
5,Great MP3 player,If you don't want to spend the money for an ipod with the same features or you just can't stand people with ipods this is a great choice. audio quality is great and navigation is very easy with the d-pad. the video playback is also very clear on the very sharp lcd screen.
1,LET DOWN,"I was so looking forwarded to getting away from the chains of the IPOD and BS Operating system that does not allow you to share your own music. The Zune arrived!!! Then it was down hill from there, I had to spend hours on line to downlaod the program and then download the updates. Once all that was done, I hook it up and started to update, next thing I know, nothig the hard drive just quick. Big let down."
2,"Terrible software, exceedingly fragile","I received my Zune at the beginning of December. I installed and used the Zune software (which is extremely inferior to iTunes), then had to download a separate ID3 tagging program to make everything show up properly (with compilation albums, you would either have 1 album with all artists being Various Artists or 25 different albums with different artists.The real kicker, however, is that after 2 weeks the LCD cracked. The outer casing, however, is fine. I had my iPod for a year and knocked it around numerous times without a hitch. I had the Zune for two weeks, never dropped it or anything, and now the screen's pretty much unviewable. The worst part is that it's not covered under Microsoft's warranty. Great.Most of my friends have older MP3 players and are looking to upgrade. I'll be making sure to dissuade them from choosing the Zune."
1,It's a DUD!,"Merry Christmas! It's a dud! Looks nice but forget about it! Look for something else. After 3 hours of trying to work through error messages (not enough space on computer....it's brand new!) and get the Zune to respond, I then spent another hour on the phone with Tech support. Sorry, no fix...so in 10-15 days, I will supposedly get a 'new' one.....we shall see! I see if I can gonow and cheer up the very disappointed teenager! Thanks Microsoft and Merry Christmas to you too!"
1,HATED IT!!,"I hated the Zune! I tried to use it for a few days and was not happy a all. It would not download songs from the Zune Martketplace. It would not tell me how to get them to download. It only told me to go to some forum and post all of the infomation about my zune. I was not going to do that. I just bought the stupid thing already it wasn't going to work right! So, I have already returned the Zune and bought an Ipod instead. MUCH EASIER!! Very happy with the Ipod! I did not have the patience for the Zune. Maybe if I was more tech savvy it would not have been so bad. I just want something I can download songs to easily and not have any problems. Not the case with the Zune. Good Luck!"
1,Never got the Zune - it was cancelled,Ironic I receive an email from Amazon requesting a review for an item they cancelled the order for. Keep up the great work.
3,Fair,"Bulkier than expected, but manageable.Battery life (even w/o using wireless link option) is terrible.Functionality is fair. Accompanying software is marginal."
5,Excellent Product,"I bought the Zune for my 13 yr old son for Christmas. He loves it. The only problem was that the screen cracked within the first two days but Amazon blazed a replacement in three days. The set up was awkward at first, typical Microsoft obtuseness, with circular registration errors (can't register that email address because it's already in use!!) but the second Zune was registered by my son, on his own, and that is a computer technology milestone. We hope to see more Zune docking options as is availalble for iPods. This product is better than iPod with the larger screen and more options. We have iPod in the house to compare and we love the new Zune."
5,"Wonderful, Lots of Fun!","I have thoroughly enjoyed my Zune. I can watch movies while I work out, listen to any CD I have and listen to the radio. It holds a lot of movies, music and pictures. It has a great size screen, it's not too small."
3,needs instructions,"I really liked it, but it is defenitly not user friendly.It sure would have been nice with a decent set of intructions instead of a 4 sided pamphlet with no useful info."
1,Yikes!! Awful experience -- don't do it!,Returned this unit after trying it for 4 days. I tried. I wanted to like it. The screen is nice. Software is worse than awful. None of my purchased music would load -- need to buy new songs from zune! I've gone back to my iPod (60Gb iPod) and the sense of relief is amazing. It just works! Don't waste your time. The Zune will be dead SOON - no way this will catch on.
1,Installation not compatible with Microsoft OS,"Supposedly, 5% or 1 out of a hundred(quoting tech service) will have their software fail on installation, which included me. Microsoft made a device incompatible with their own Operating system, which is unfortunate for some. I bought an Ipod even though i tried as hard as possible to stay an avid Microsoft fan."
2,was thinking about buying this. here's why not,Bigger and heavier than the ipodCrippled wireless (nearly worthless)79 points per song = 99 cents. why not be honest about it?14 hour battery life claims are one song on repeat. why not be honest about it?no play for sure devicethe only benefit over an ipod is screen size. i'll take the iPod so I can use iTunes and buy videos and more.
1,defeat the iPod? not with these prices...,The only way to defeat an iPod is giving a BETTER PRODUCT at a BETTER PRICE. Microsoft has failed doing this. Why on earth would you buy this instead of the trendy iPod?
4,good product,"Pro:1. No problem with software, installed with ease2. Selection buttons performs well, I like it better than ipod3. Screen bigger than Ipod, produces great pictures4. Zune market place well organized, easy to use, easy to sync, slight edge over Ipod5. Marketplace subscription great for the price6. sturdy case, handles abuse better7. Wireless feature neat once you learn how to use itCon:1. Marhetplace catalog not as large as that of Ipod, otherwise I would give it a 5 star"
5,Pleased with my Zune,"Just had to add my 2 cents about my Microsoft Zune. I've had 2 ipods over the years and though pods are the most popular mp3 player's around, the Zune is a worthy contender. The sound and is incredible w/ the right earbuds and the software is more than adequate for my use. I highly recommend this player."
1,Zune doesn't cut the mustard,"Some ideas you know are right but the way they are done makes you feel depressed, this is the real mark of a Microsoft product, so near and yet so dissappointing at the same time.If you like the way Windows 95 works you may like the Zune but otherwise why not go for the best and buy an iPod (better support, better song & video library, better 3rd party options..."
5,Quality Product,"The 30 GB Zune is a all around good product. Audio sounds good, video is clear. It is a little pricy, but is worth it in the long run."
3,Zune 30gb customer review off Amazon.com,"The product (Zune 30gb red) i purchased off Amazon.com was ok...I opened the package and installed the software which no longer works on my computer due to some unknown difficulty with the master cd. Another thing, it came with a USB cord to plug into the computer and when i tried to use it... the two buttons on the side of the USB cord which plug into the Zune itself fell off completely...so whenever i want to disconnect the two i have to find some pliers or something to push into the USB adapter which will enventually disconnect. Im very disappointed that the master cd and the USB cord were defective..I hate to have to go to my friends house and use his computer on his time just to load my Zune.Thanks"
4,30 Gig Zune,"I have owned both the Zune and Ipod. I ended up with a Zune after my hardly used Ipod stopped working...I had the Ipod for 2 years and barely used it so I was mad when it just stopped working one day. I ended up buying a Zune because I found a deal for a 30 gig for 130.00 and I'm so happy with the Zune. I love the radio feature, how easy it is to find a certain band, the picture function, and the syncing function. My only grip with the Zune is the software. Itunes was very easy to use and I have had a hard time with the marketplace and loading music...I've finally figure it out but I wish they would make it more friendly user...I recommend the Zune over ipod..."
3,zune in question,"I have installed a little over 8 gigs of music and 2 gigs of podcast. I find that when music is installed the zune picks the genre(not happy) I have yet to find out how to change it myself if able. the player works well when playing audio quality wise.the exception is when ""shuffle all"" is used the zune will move to a new selection in the middle of a song and this has happened multiple times. The ability to get podcast from online is great although very slow process. I have not found how to get podcasts from a cd or dvd to install into the zune under podcasts instead of music as zune likes to put it.I do say at this point in fairness to zune I have not fully investigated cures to these issues however they would not be issues if the software for the zune was more user friendly and informative."
5,Love the Zune!,"I'm very happy with my 30GB Zune. The sound is full, the color sharp and bright, and the software easy to use, though the initial update the Zune goes through when you first install the software is long with very little indication of its progression status. Still I love it and getting new music on it is a snap. Plus, the red color is cool!"
4,Love it!,"I love my new Zune 30gb. It is so easy. My daughter had an IPod and it was much harder to navigate. It has been so easy to learn. My only complaint is loading movies. I bought this to put movies on for trips. I still have not figured out where to buy them. I hoped to find them on Zune Marketplace but if they are on there I don't know where to look. Music on ZMarketplace is great, very cheap and tons of it!"
1,Zune 30 GB,"This Zune has been a nightmare. First, we could not load the software on our computer, we have a VIO,worked with Microsoft, Zune(Microsoft) and Sony. Second, we never could turn it on after we unpluged it from the USB port, it's returned to Zune repair, we have not been able to use it at all yet."
4,30 GB Zune,Good picture quality for video files. Easy to access downloaded music and video files. A little cumbersome to download video files or CDs off line. Not accessible as a USB storage device in explorer.
3,My small travel companion,"It is nicer than i expected , great sound ,easy to use ,only thing I wish to be improved by Microsoft is the device firmware and software add a more versatility to it , so if I want to delete a song , I don't have to be connected to the computer to do it , or organizing the songs by editing the info of each song , and more ."
1,unhappy,"I have no complaints about the zune itself, I actually have a 4 GB zune that I love, but I had originally purchased this 30 GB one, but was not notified that it was out of stock for 2 weeks, by then the prices everwhere had gone up and I had to by a different one in my price range."
4,Everything good but the Sync,"I bought the Zune because I didnt want to buy the Ipod. The only problems i had is that it does not come with a portable power unit, so you have to plug it in to your computer in order to charge it. Also if you wanna see movies you have to download them. There's a way around that put you need another software to sync with it. I bought an external harddrive and created a file and download it as an MPEG-4. Other than that I think this is a very good device."
4,"AWESOME, BUT LACKS INSTRUCTIONS","This is an awesome, little gadget. However, the package lacks detailed instructions. For those that are a little tech-challenged, you might want to go with something a little less technical. For those that love new technology, this is definitely the product for you!"
5,I love my zune,I love my zune!! it's amazing. the screen is soo big and large and very clear. my friends said that I should of got an ipod but when I showed them the zune they were surprised. I highly recommend this product you will not go wrong. actually I'm thinking of getting the 80gb.
5,Love it!!!,I absolutely love my Zune. I've had it for a year and a half now. The Zune marketplace is the best. I pay 15 dollars a month for unlimited downloads. I use it everday. Yea this review sounds like a commercial but it's really nice. IPOD KILLER!!
2,"Zune, what a disappointment","I have used many ipods but wanted to be different and bought a zune.What was I thinking? I hate this zune. I have spent hours trying to work the bugs out. It only worked good for about a month. Now it will not even sync up to ANY computer, yes I have bought a new cable. Please whatever you do just jump on the bandwagon and buy an IPOD. Im selling my zune on ebay and buyin one myself."
4,Zune 30gig,The device works as promised. I had some concerns about it being refurbishedbut have had absolutely no problems.
1,Zune Gone Bad,When I first received my Zune it didn't boot up properly so i exchanged it. Then the when the replacement came it froze up on me in about two weeks and I had to get a refund for the item. I like the Zune it just didn't work for me.
1,It won't turn on,"One week after I bought it, the 30Gb zune won't turn on. I tried every mothod, it just doesnt response any thing. I found that many users have the same problem. It's really not a good choice."
2,STOP SYNCING!!!!,"Surprise surprise, microsoft makes another problem, i mean- product and whats wrong with it...the software. The zune software is HORRIBLE. It took everything from my hard drive, i have like 30 instructional videos that i dont need in my pocket and it synced ALL of them. What's worse, I deleted them from the library, and the next time i started up the program, its synced them AGAIN! It takes the Zune about 20 min each time I attached it to sync to my computer. I have been an ipod owner for the last 4 years and I LOVE them as much as I love itunes. The zunes menu system is unintuitive and options are difficult to adjust. I hope this so called godsend of an update that Microsoft is releasing will improve the functionality of their half-wit product."
1,Just as crappy as Microsoft Word and Windows,"I USED to have Zune for about a month until I couldn't stand it anymore. It was buggy and songs would get deleted and just wouldn't work at all. Then I got an iMac and decided to just buy an iPod. THANK GOD!Finally I just threw the Zune in the garbage after Microsoft wouldn't do anything to fix it. I don't understand why people try to avoid iPods. They work 1,000 times better than anything else. Whether or not you like Apple is not an issue; they're just a big, evil, faceless corporation like Microsoft and any other computer company. So what? They have better MP3 players, and that's the point! They are a better deal for how well they work, as well as their reliability and durability.Just to put it simply; don't waste your money on cheap junk like this. Just get an iPod and you will be happy :) Now I am happy and thoughts of Zune murder are not on my mind!"
3,Average.,"Its thick. Very thick. Its heavy. The screen and the controls scratch easily, and it only plays wmv's.i've had this for about a year now, and i have been bored of it since the beginning. it is a disgrace to Microsoft and a rip off to the ipod.the pros:its a tank. its virtually indestructible."
3,Zune 30,Love the look. Easy to use software. Battery life doesn't last at all if you are watching videos. Can't buy movies at their website. Zune to Zune sent songs only stay on your Zune for (3) days.Still work needs to be done. I hope that the next gen. corrects some of these issues. Zune could be the best on the market if Microsoft choose to fix these problems.
2,You would be better off with something else,"A friend of mine bought one a zune. You've probably already read that it is larger than other mp3 players in size but the real problem is the difficulty of installing the software and getting it to work with the PC. My friend has a Dell that is only about 3 months old running Win XP and we had a hard time getting the PC to recognize the Zune. Just to see if it was his port we tried my Ipod (he already had itunes installed) recognized it just like that. After about an hour fiddling with the zune he took it back and exchanged for an ipod and is quite happy with it.The ipod is just a better thought out device, the sandisk player is also supposed to be pretty good but I would stay away from the zune if I were you. Lots of money spent on advertising this device, doesn't look like much was spent developing it."
5,Zune player,"I like this device. It's easy to use, has a great display for graphics, and great sound. It is very reasonably priced, too."
3,Zune 30 GB,Very nice screen and video playback. The installation process is incredibly long. Plan on getting it started then having something else to do to occupy the wait time. Device is bulky and a bit heavy. Does what it is advertised to do.
5,Great,"It came in a transparent hard case! :)I'm very picky when it comes to music,... I'll never fill 30Gb'sThere is absolutely NOTHING easier to use for MP3 players than the Zune software! Love it"
1,"Lousy, clunky, useless","Well, who needs simple mp3 playing anymore? At 5 years after iPod's introduction, what people truly wants is a MULTIMEDIA player and there Zunes fails short: it plays only M$'s own wm and a bastard type of mpeg4 of its own creation when most people now rips DVDs using the .avi format either in DivX or Xvid.What we need is a player that allows the user to load the latest codecs into it to play any kind of media format he prefers.Zune, instead, puts the user in a straightjacket imposing what Microsoft wants him to play.And what M$ allows you to play is movies with no compression which take over 2Gb space when any DivX takes only 700Mbs. On top of that--even in this day when most TVs support letterbox, Zune forces you to view them in the standard 4:3 ratio, distorting the images.I'm selling mine on eBay and getting something else."
1,Sucks,Don't work. Zune window live is hard to download. Hard to use.I would seriously think about purchasing one of these beforebuying save your money on something better.
2,Horrible,"I bought this for my daughter 4 years ago and she like it the first time but now she hates it now because of the battery. The battery rans out very fast. It gets down one for 30 seconds and when I delete her pictures, it deletes it by iself. Even we go somewhere far away it rans out. This is a horrible product!"
1,No Zune,When I order something I would like to receive the product!!! Not a cancellation. I am very unsatisfied.
1,Terrible software-Return as Zune as possible while you can!,"Worst intallation process of any music player device ever.Can't deactivate the auto sync process so you can't control what music is transferred to device. When you connect, your entire library syncs automtically. Froze 3 times on syncing and then would not recognize the device upon reconnection.The selection of songs was good on the Marketplace but the Zune player interface is confusing and the layout unappealing.I am returning my Zune as Zune as possible to Best Buy."
2,ZUNE is no IPOD nor ITUNE,"The product is not ""bad"" but it is not all that great neither. The sound is respectable, but I do not like the fact tht all the music on my hard drive was not synched, unlike the IPOD which synched all my music when I attached it to my MAC and my PC... The IPOD transfer of files is much quicker also. But, I do like the ABC order feature - when you scroll through the music selections a large letter shows up and you can easily identify the song, etc - this feature is good for visually challenged individuals. I like the Zune, but I do not love it..."
1,Horrendous!,The software is absolutely the worst on the unit as well as the computer.Wait for at least the third generation for this.Back it goes within half a day of its purchase.Save your time and money. Microsoft really screwed up on this one.It's unreal how badly it functions.
4,Slick and reliable,"I've owned several MP3 players of various makes and models (Apple, Zune, Creative Arts, etc) but I can say that to this day (2012) the Zune still had the slickest interface. Controlled by three main controls: back, play, navigate, the Zune was a worthy competitor to the scroll wheel generation of iPods.Visually, the interface of the Zune was lovely. It had deep black backgrounds and illuminated white texts that lit up eagerly upon scroll or selection. Though later upgrades would add games, the Zune's forte was music (and podcasts, FM radio, etc) and video. Album art displayed prominently on the Zune's large screen, and video was crisp and displayed in a nice aspect ratio.The hardware itself was even nice. The actual material of the unit had a ""double dip"" tone to it, that gave it a sort of glow of color. It was sturdy enough not to need a case, and the screen was pretty resilient.If you're looking for a no-frills MP3 player to this day, the Zune is still a solid pick."
3,Marginally satisfied,"The product arrived shortly. I'd say about 3 business days later. Product was in good working condition except the charger. One of the 2 buttons you press to release the charger from the zune wasnt even there like it had been broken off completely. This was not in the product description and that, is bs. When I take the charger out of the zune I have to stick something in the hole where the button should be and this makes me feel like Im messing up the charger a little more everytime I do. All in all I give 3/5 and encourage the seller to include more detail in their future descriptions. The only reason I dont feel like I got ripped off is cuz of the price. But it worked and I guess thats all that matters.."
4,Maybe they didn't update their versions of Windows...?,"I got my Zune as a late Christmas present and I was on the fence after reading the negative reviews about it. Let me tell you, do NOT buy into the negativity. I've read the horror stories about botched installs and I didn't have any issues of the sort. I just popped in the CD and BAM, I was off and running! I can only surmise that the people who had trouble installing haven't updated their systems. It says on the bottom of the box ""Windows XP SP2, or later"". I really like the big screen and the music quality is top-notch. As for those who want to use it as an extra hard-drive, well it's a music/video player, NOT an alternative hard-drive. I tried out the Zune marketplace and I found it very intuitive and EASY. It's a great player and it's a great start for Microsoft in the music player department. I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because it has to convert some of my videos to go onto the player. Besides, nothing's perfect. ^_^"
3,disappointed customer,I was lead to believe that I had purchased the item. Then a day or so before it was due to be shipped I got a message saying that the item was not available. They refunded me for the item. I was upset in that why didn't they state before the purchase that the item was not available. Why take my money and hold it for many days.. making me think and anticipate it arrival. It was to be a Christmas present for my 10 year old daughter. I was excited to think that I had gotten one for her and at this price point. I am not going to trust of do business with this seller again. I shop quite often on line. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller in the future. I felt hoodwinked.
5,WOW! I LOVE IT>>>,Its great and I love the LCD Screen...plus Microsoft searches for the covers of your music selection and comes up when you play it...I wish they had more accessories for the ZUNE but its worth it!
3,More or less,"Resulta comodo, buena memoria, pero no se pueden borrar las canciones salvo en la computadora, y el software necesita mejorarse y hacerse mas amigable."
1,still like my iPod Mini better...,"In so many ways it's *almost* an iPod, but not quite. The new iPod shuffle and new iPod nano would make much better gifts."
1,Microsoft faild me?!,"We bought our unit three month ago . Yesterday my son left the unit charging at nite we woke up to find a crack on the LCD . I googled the problem and there were many problems like mine. Call Microsoft and they told me that the screen was not covered by the warrenty, I had apple before never had this problem, Buyers beware"
4,Better than an iPod Classic?,"I believe the new and old Zune are both better than the iPod Classic or Video iPods for several reasons (especially after the firmware update):1. Zune can sync via Wi-Fi2. ""All you can eat"" Zune pass. For those who buy multiple cds a month and cycle through cds quite frequently, this is an awesome option - $15/month3. Large bright screen4. Navigation is even better than iPod5. Has a more durable build6. The new Zune comes with premium ear-buds7. Ability to share music with friends who also have a Zune8. Has a built-in FM radio"
1,No Better than iPod!,"I was so excited when I got my new Zune in the mail. I recently sold my iPod because it was so incompatible with Walmart music downloads (88 cents to iTunes 99!), windows media player, and all my other music software. I decided to get a zune. But it is huge! Very large design. And it is no more compatible than iPod!!! It will not work with any software other than zune. No Windows Media Player, Musicmatch Jukebox, Walmart downloads, or anything else. The ipod is much cooler looking, and is much smaller. The zune's colors are boring compared to iPod's. If you are trying to decide between two incompatible mp3 players - choose iPod!!!"
3,Zune Great - Softwear - not so much,"Last summer I got a Zune for my birthday. Due to circumstances I won't go into (it fell into the cat's waterdish) I had to replace it, and I was happy to do it because I really like the Zune itself. However, the Microsoft software that supports it is difficult to use, and just when I'm getting the hang of the old softwear, they do an upgrade (mandatory), and I have to start all over again trying to figure out what they've changed and how the new software works.Some of the problems I've run into is that it's difficult to remove podcasts one's already listened to, and if one want's to download a podcast that isn't part of the Zune marketplace, it's not easy to do.I obviously like the product, or I wouldn't have bought a second one. I just hope that the next upgrade of the software will correct these problems."
5,Zune is great.,The Zune works great and is very easy to use. I love the large screen and easy to use controls. We lokked at other mp3's and are glad we chose this one
5,Zune review,The Zune is great - it lacks what a lot of things do today which is directions - but once I started to use it I love it. My husband and I both have one and you can send a song from one Zune to another - it is super. also if you sign up for a membership the majority of uploads are free...I like it better than an ipod
1,not worth the trouble!,"I bought the Zune for my little brother in November. It stopped working before Christmas, so I exchanged it for another one. The second one stopped working as well. I will be buying an IPOD now."
1,Designed to hoodwink consumers,"While the larger screen suggests higher resolution, the number of pixels is identical to the Apple iPod. Blown up that size, album art looks a lot worse, is more pixelated with compression artifacts abound.Lack of compatibility with both iTunes AND Windows Media Player is definitely not a positive. The included ZUNE software feels mostly incomplete.The final straw is that circular control. ""Oh cool,"" I thought. ""Somebody finally figured out how to do the scroll wheel like on the iPod."" Think again. The ""scroll wheel"" you see at the bottom of the Zune is nothing more than a cheap, flimsy four-way rocker switch designed to look like a touch pad.Complete, utter garbage. Avoid avoid avoid."
4,much better than the ipod,"the sound, the graphics, price, You name it hands down it's better than any other mp3 player. My friends have the others they all wish that had gotten this one instead."
5,Outstanding Device,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She took it back to college with her and she has become the music person at the dorm parties. She shows up with her Zune, they hook it up to some speakers and rock the house. My son has an Ipod and he thinks the Zune is cooler. Great big screen, bigger than the Ipod. I think once this thing starts to catch on a little more, Apple with have a real competitor."
1,What a substandard piece of crap!!! Go away Zune!,"Got the Zune for Christmas. Wanted an iPod, but what the heck, should not be much difference, eh? Oh, how wrong I was! Software was NOT easy to use, despite what some reviewers have said. Zune Marketplace sucks big ones. You need to prepay to buy points. Must buy points in dollar increments, but songs don't cost exact dollar amounts, so you end up with a few cents here & there that you won't be able to use fully until you buy a bunch of songs. I won't be around that long!As for the Zune itself, it is clunky to use and looks like a toy. I've had enough of it. I bought myself an iPod and the Zune is on sale on Craigslist. Not one call on it. I guess others are smart enough to avoid it.Do yourself a favor - buy the iPod. It is no more expensive, but it's built how a music player should be built, and the iTunes software and music store blow away Zune's!"
1,WORSE MP3 PLAYER EVER!!!,"THIS IS THE WOR5E MP3 PLAYER I HAVE EVER OWNED. RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, SOFTWARE WILL NOT LOAD, NOTHING BUT ERRORS; COMPUTER WITH XP WILL NOT EVEN RECOGNIZE THE ZUNE AS PRESENT SO CANNOT UPLOAD MUSIC. THIS IS A MICROSOFT PRODUCT AND IT LITERALLY STINKS....MICROSOFT SHOULD DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND GET THEIR STUFF TOGETHER IF THEY WANT TO COMPETE IN THIS ARENA.ANYONE WANT TO BUY MY ZUNE.........CHEAP!!!"
1,Meant for Whacked Out High School Kids,"Can't get the unit to accept non-encrypted books on CD, older music CDs, nor can I watch unencrypted DVD titles. Seems a pity with that beautiful screen that you can't take it on travel and watch a few movies.I alsmot never listen to music, but I do listen to books and lectures, and watch movies. Also, getting the files on this thing is a nightmare. Users can't just connect it and move the files over into their own folders.The Zune is made for one thing. Buying and playing downloadable music. I'd reckon there should be a market for adults who want to walk and listen to music or lectures, or travel and watch a movie or two.Just another example of Gate's way or the highway."
1,two broke within 6 months,"My daughter got one for Christmas, and the touch pad quit responding after 5 months, we returned it after letting it sit around for a long time. The return service worked well and we got another one around the next Christmas. The screen on that one quick lighting up in June of the next year. We will go with a Creative or some other brand."
4,Too expensive for what you get...,"The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the pictures seem ""smokey"" and the sound is okay (and I mean ""okay,"" especially for something that is SO expensive). It's also heavy and bulky. I got one as a gift and ended up selling it."
5,Good Job,Sent very quick and in good condition. Download movies to your Zune or Ipod at Miamifilms (dot)net
4,Zune 30 refurbished,"Ordered this to replace my original that would not charge because of internal sync board defect. You can send these discontinued devices to repair experts (expensive), or attempt to self repair (cheap, but you better have knowledge and high skill level). The replacement I ordered looks and works like a ""new"" player!"
4,replacement zune,"I purchased this Zune as a replacement for one that my daughter had given me for a birthday gift and was stolen. It arrived in good shape, without any charging cords. I am in the process of downloading my playlists and so far it works perfectly."
2,Where's the battery?,"Now, I have never owned a Zune, but have two close friends who did. I played with it for all of a few minutes and was pleased by the large color screen, the sound quality, the video capabilities.However, both of my friends wanted to exchange their product for a different brand mp3 player after a mere two days of ownership.Apparently the Zune's fresh, fully charged battery barely makes it past an hour or two of play. It just doesn't support the capabilities of this little machine. And that terrible battery life just overshadows whatever potential it might have had."
3,Not a touch wheel like the iPod,Nice try ... it does the job but needs more work. The feel is very nice but the sharing is only good for three plays and then you must buy the song. It's screen is 320X240. Bla. I'll stay with the iPod for now.
2,not better than ipod 4G nano,"I also bought ipod 4G nano, so I have a comparation. Uploading a vedio in iTurn to Zune is very very slow, because it need time to convert the vedio format, I think."
1,Bummer,Sadly the zune did not sync properly but the company did try to get me a replacement but they did not have one. So they quickly refunded my money. I was only out the shipping money. So it cost me ten dollars to send it back. Being it was defective I feel they should have refunded my shipping too.
2,Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player,It has quite a few problems but is functional. Got my money back. Thank you. No response from seller..but Amazon gave us money back. Thank you.
2,didn't last long..had to return after 3 weeks stopped working,I bought this for my son for his birthday. After about 3 weeks it stopped working. Had to send it back. The company will reimburse shipping through amazon. No paperwork with product. Will see how it turns out after repair.
4,Better than IPOD,"I've had both, first i dont have to worry about the converting music into the Itunes, second, when I'm at the gym I can tune into the gym's FM freqeuncy and listen to the TV while working out. The Sync on the zune is faster than the IPOD. The shortfall is Marketplace doesnt have as much, but anything in the itunes can also be put on your zune. So i just pawn off my girlfriend's Itunes libary, hehehe, dont tell her."
5,Have only had it a couple of weeks.,Bought this on sale for my son for Christmas. It has an incredibly sharp picture and he has put a lot of things on it already. We have found the synching gets trashed when synchin while using the computer online so he does it when the computer is not in use. It takes some time. He is very happy with it. A friend at work plays it through the port with speakers and the sound is great.
4,"""Pretty cool""","I gave this as a Christmas present. I am told it's ""Pretty cool"". I've been told it works well, is easy to load and operate, and the sound is excellent both as a player and when in radio mode. It certainly satisfied the end user. It seems to have been a good buy."
4,Satisfied with ZUNE!!,"I got my 30gig Zune as an X-mas gift and took it for a test run today. It's a really awesome mp3 player so far, nice storage for the price paid for it, easy setup and software updating. I even thought that the packaging was pretty neat. Synced right up to the music on my computer and ripped a cd with no flub. Not a very detailed review but I'm happy with this product."
4,Excellent Product !,"Excellent for the money, bought it on Cyber Monday.Works great, still trying to find out how to import different forms of video onto it, but overall, an excellent Mp3 player. 30 GB holds enough storage, and a nice large screen. Works well and syncs with the Zune software."
1,God I wanted to love this...,"It's more or less of a laundry list of features I wanted in an mp3 player. Wireless transmitting? FM Radio? Count me in!Three hours - yes, you read that right, actual time and no exaggeration - after sitting at my computer (half of the time it was frozen) I returned the device. Absolutely horrible. Once I did get songs onto it the ZUNE ITSELF FROZE!I took it back to the store and came home with an iPod. I know iPods are huge and people hate the popular product but they really can't be compared. The iPod oblitherates the Zune - and this is coming from an anti-Apple guy!I want Microsoft to give me back those wasted hours and the restocking fee. What a waste."
1,Please do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this product.,"When I heard that Microsoft was launching a product initially I was skeptical. I had had numerous problems with their other products, but this seemed like it might be different, but alas, another problem riddled product from Microsoft.I purchased my Zune from Target and after getting it home, I worked on installing the software and trying to get my PC to recognize the Zune for more than FOUR hours. This product was clearly not ready for release, but Microsoft was in such a hurry to get this thing out for the Holiday, they rushed it out without proper testing.There is nothing redeemable about this product. From software, to hardware, to their store. It's just not a good product. My prediction, this will be pulled from the market within a year. I returned my Zune and decided to upgrade my iPod to the new 80g model. I got it home and it was working within 5 minutes. Save yourself from the headaches, DO NOT buy this product!"
2,Not worth the trouble,"The Zune is a great product once you get by the tech problems and customer service. VERY difficult to load the software. After trying on 2 different new computers for several hours, we called customer service. After a total of 5 hours (2 calls) on hold for a CS rep we were able to get the software loaded. The software is a bit glitchy. Have still not been able to get vidoes onto it, but afraid of the wait to call the CS to get help."
1,"Horrible device, huge waste of money","This is probably the worst device I have ever had the misfortune of using. Aside from the painful software support, buggy/crashieness of the device, and terrible audio format compatibility, the device is clumsy. The WiFi does not work as advertised, it wastes battery life (which isn't so hot to begin with) and this thing doesn't even work with Microsoft's own classic online music service (Since this is not a 'Play for Sure' device).Do not waste your money on this device. Save yourself headache and regret by getting a new iPod, or waiting for the 6th gen iPod to come out later this coming year. You'll thank yourself for going with a quality product instead of this hodge-podge, 'rushed to market', flunk.Not to mention MS' awful DRM scheme and policies with their music store. Owning your music is the way to go."
1,Software is horrible.,"Software is the worst I've ever used for any application from a major manufacturer. Nuff said. Have no idea about the device and its capabilities. The software is so limiting I can't even get past it. Makes iTunes look brilliant.Update:Going back. Device itself has potential, software is for kids."
1,doesn't work,I ordered this and tried to sync it to computer etc with no success. Called the company and was on the phone with techs for two hours to try to fix the issues which they constinued to insinuate that it was something I was doing wrong. After two or three tries they finally decided that it was defective. They said that they would send me packing materials to return it and after they received it they would iether repair or replace it. Told me it would take 3 to 4 weeks after they received it and that they could nto guarantee color. (I said that was not acceptable as I had paid extra to get red) I asked if I could get a refund and they said no. soooo I called Amazon and they took it right back and issued a credit to my card. I then order the IPOD and it works perfectly.
1,Zune Stinks!,"I'm returning the Zune. First it came with no real information about how to use it (no manual or anything), then we couldn't get the software to properly download, then we discovered the Zune wouldn't charge. We finally got the thing working but then the charging port wasn't working (after only 24 hours of using it)."
1,Poor Zune Customer Service Response,"The device looks great, quit impressive, worked ok first 3 or 4 days, user learning curve; turn the device on won't stay on, hook up to computer, device turns on, but the the hard disk continues to search and search, can't find operating system or something, let battery charge, disconnect, try to turn it on, disk runs, disk searches shuts down. Call Zune support, their conclusion battery not charged,(operater error) charge again, still not working, call again support, same response; operator error, charge battery. Still not working and so far Microsoft Zune Support will not replace or repair this wonderful device. Also any movie compression software is a mystery. Not very pleased!"
2,Late to the game,"For the same money, stck with tried and true. No iPod killer here. Software blows, and the software is what makes the iPod. Reasonable from a hardware perspective, but again, the software is what makes the player. For a hundred dollars less, it would be a steal; but it is the same price as the gold standard. I would at least wait for the next generation."
1,Just Say NO!,"Not at all reliable. SW does not install properly and is not compatible with other media software. Store's ""points"" system is very confusing. Round control thing is really just up/down and left/right. Been waiting for something other than an iPod worth my money, but the zune is not it. Maybe I should try SanDisk or iPod next."
3,an actual honest review.,"i've had my zune for about three weeks now. i got to say, it's pretty darn cool. but you're looking at my rating and going, ""what?"" read below and you'll find out.CONS: well, it might just be my device, but i've been having problems with it ever since the day i got it. the software is really tricky, the battery life is practically NON-EXISTENT. freezes about half the time. if you're turned on by the wi-fi, don't even bother. no one even has a zune and even if they do, the sharing takes a long time and you can only have it for 3 days/plays. oh, and it's chunky. and it's not a scroll wheel (ie. ipod)PROS: HUGE screen. pretty much scratch resistent. radio. video. pictures are good quality. good sound. the interface is cool."
2,zune,Product looks great but I cannot figure out how to add the device to my real player to add my songs.
5,Zune-a-roni,My roommate had one and it rocked. I got one for x-mas and to my expectations it rocked also. It is great because it seamlessly sync's with our XboX 360 so I can rock out while I play all of our new games. Don't get an ipod if you are using Microsoft products throughout your home.
3,"not great, but cheaper","pros:- video clarity is good- big screen- pricecons:- software - worst music sync software i have ever seen, lot of problems, got very old version with package- cant use as external hard drive- not satisfied with battery life- only supports few video formats"
2,A Short Analysis on Zune,"all in all a mediocre media player that will give more frustration than satisfaction. you'll get by with it, but there are many shortcomings within the device and its syncing program that will probably drive you nuts. its biggest flaw, though, is its WMV-only video playback. i've yet to find a decent program that can convert a DVD, MPEG, AVI, etc. etc., into an exceptional WMV file. granted conversion can be done via the (zune) program, but this can take hours on end to achieve.for almost $100 less than the powerhouse iPod, i guess you can't expect too much. if you got the money, stick with the superior alternative. if not, tread carefully and be aware that while a zune does its job, it doesn't do it very exceptionally."
1,Long way to go Microsoft!,"I never owned an iPod, so since Zune hit the market I'd thought I'd check it out. Went to my local retailer and was able to do some hands on comparing the iPod and Zune.The iPod had a much better feel and was lighter. The sound qualty was the same (using the same set of head phones for each). The scrolling was easier on the iPod. The Zune is larger than the iPod, the iPod felt right in my hand.The video screen on the Zune was a little larger but the clarity seem to pale next to the iPods.Now as far as software installation, I don't know. but when I walked out of the store, an iPod came home with me.The iPod software installed quickly, works smoothly with iTunes. I am so glad I compare first!I say get an iPod!"
1,nothing interesting,"The Zune is basically a half-done ipod clone. It doesn't do anything particularly well and does nothing better than an ipod. The only thing to recommend it is that its tied into the microsoft ""world"" of services and software. If having anything not made by microsoft concerns you, go with the Zune. Otherwise don't bother.It usually takes microsoft two generations of product and up to four years to get a product ""right"". Even if you think you need the Zune, I would give it a few years."
1,No support for Zune products,"DON'T BUY ANY ZUNE/MICROSOFT PRODUCT!! I'm still looking at a blank Zune screen and a worthless device because Microsoft refuses to admit there is a problem with Zune as of 12/31/08. Don't trust Microsoft, and don't buy Zune unless you just want to throw your money away!! I've never been a Mac person, but now it's time to change!"
5,30 G ZUNE,"This is a great product, I like it much better than an IPOD and it is a lot less expensive."
3,Its really this SIMPLE...,"Here it is..Before you read...know that i'm not trying to hate on the Zune. And I did buy a Zune but it was stolen out of my car, then i was given another one as a gift.Pros- 3inch screen, Radio, WiFi ideaCons- Cant play any music from Zune when connected to PC, When browsing through Zune you cant look at full song list of an artist(have to look through each separate album, so you cant use shuffle feature on a particular artist...which really kills...), Installation can be confusing(first time i installed it, it synced every song from my PC).Overall: If you like to listen to music and watch movies on a 3inch screen, get this. If you just want to listen to music and watch a few music videos here and there, get an ipod."
4,Zune 30GB,"The Zune 30 is a great product... a little bulky but overall a great device. I use to own (well still do, but dont use) an Ipod Nano and just wanted something more compatible with other devices. This is a great buy."
1,zune=sucks,"i was going to buy a video ipod but i got a zune instead because i thought the bigger screen would be better and it claimed that it worked with itunes. well, it didnt. right when i connected the device with my computer, it loaded every music and picture file onto the software. it didnt load itunes music thought, because itunes locked all of their stuff to only work with ipods. so i took everything off and took it to target to exchange for a video ipod but they wont return anything below $100 without receipts. so dont make the 2 main mistakes i made: DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A ZUNE and dont throw your receipts away."
5,Excellence In Bits,"The Duracraft Ultimate 300 piece Drill Bit Set is the best set of drill bits I have ever seen. The variety ofbits is what amazes me the most. There is a bit for every conceivable drilling operation that you would have to do! This set is portable enough to take with you anywhere. Since I do work in apartments away from home,this portability is important to me. The quality of these bits is very good. I am very pleased with this set!"
1,not the same protech 300 pc...,"I looked for this set all over! a friend has one too but his looks way better, he got it at costco online! a lot of the drill bits are loose inside so every time I open the case they fall all over the place,quality its ok but no great for the price over all I regret the purchase..."
2,Dull bits of poor quality materials,"I needed a drill bit set offering a large range of sizes. The Pro-Tech Ultimate offered a huge range of sizes with drills made for wood and metal. I have used seven different metal bits and have not been able to create a hole - even through a metal stud. Four of the bits broke with their first use. The case is nice, and the screwdrivers and nut spinners seem OK. I was hopeful that this would be a wonderful set to drill bits turned out to be fairly worthless."
3,no Carftman,I got this from sears thinking I was buying a craftsman set. Wrong they are are duracraft they are great looking but so far the hole saw is just worth less and broke the 1st use. the 3 drills I used in mental how they worked for one use only the box is great the tools no so
2,Answer to your Question,"The answer to your question is, "" Wild as the west TEXAS wind"". Glad to be of some help.Jeremy"
4,"If they say sober, we say NO!","If you're from the Motorhead/Venom school of Metal, this band is exclusively for you! Every song is a total rocker, and lyrics dealing with booze, Metal, headbanging, spikes, and more booze! It's a shame this band has seemed to have dropped off the face of the planet, 'cuz they are a lot of fun to rock out to"
2,disappointing,"i bought this a couple of months ago and was initially highly satisfied with the batteries. however, a week or so ago the charger stopped working. every time i'd plug it in the light would be on for half a second before going off. you could jiggle the charger in the plug to see if it worked, but the charger doesn't stay in the position.so i'm basically left with four good batteries and a charger that doesn't work, and now i'm back to using my old charger which would take over a whole night to recharge.you're far better off with a rayovac or something, the new ones which charge batteries in fifteen minutes."
4,Reliable. Maybe expensive but I trust Monster,My techie friend w/ $$$ parents likes to buy Monster products so i gave it a try. I am a photographer and need good power when I am on the red carpet like movie premiers. This delivers enough juice for about 80-100 flashes and I exchange out to the 2nd set of Monsters I have. This is my budget way of getting good consumer batteries so I don't have to pay the $4-500 in a professional battery hip pack which would last me 900 flashes which I don't need. Decent product. The batteries are marketed well. These batteries I have are manufactured in China or Pakistan. Don't like it affects the quality.
1,"Uhm, no.","I read this book years ago. I stumbled across it while overseas in a remote area with limited reading resources. Why am I writing about it now? My wife and I were discussing the worst books we have every had the displeasure of reading.Though I do not remember intimate details of the characters and total layout of the book; what I do remember is burning it, publicly. It was the only joy and satisfaction I obtained from reading Night of the Moonbow. When asked why I was burning a book in the BBQ pit of our tabernacle, I replied, ""To save everyone in the future that might possible stumble upon this book and force themselves to finish it as I did!""Good Luck.It is to this day the only book I've torched."
4,"Yeah, but the other one's out of print","Another review complained about the price of this book, sending you looking for Magazine Cover to Cover. Well, that book is now out of print. I loved using that book for my Magazine Publishing class, and if this book is the same, this is the one I'm getting. The only other option out there that doesn't look like Magazines for Dummies is The Magazine Publishing Industry, which is the textbook I had when I took the class. It is boring, with less detail on the production and design of the magazine, and few helpful or encouraging strategies."
3,"Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing, Fat-Free Original, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)",The only problem is the expiration date being to close to the purchase so only if you own a restaurant or have a big family to share with I don't recommend buying this product.
1,"So much potential, but fails to deliver","I must agree with the Seth Mulliken's review below. I also purchased the CD thinking that the combination of blues and hip-hop beats held so much potential that there was no way this album could fail. Unfortunately, I was proved wrong. The only plus on the disc is Chris' guitar work, which is quite impressive. However, the tired rhymes and less-than innovative beats more than make up for it, truly deeming much of the CD unlistenable. Frankly, I am thinking of a way to exchange it and get something a bit more easy on the ears."
4,THE fusion of blues and hip hop,"i think this is an excellent fusion of blues and hip hop. he did an excellent job with this. songs like ""cloning overture"" kind of ""bring you IN"" while songs like ""yo kiss"" and ""ghetto child"" pat you down. if you're already a chris thomas king fan, and you don't have this one, you're in for a excellent surprise! (even if you have 21st century blues from da hood)"
5,get this CD,"Just when I thought I'd heard it all, somebody put a copy of Chris Thomas King's Dirty South Hip Hop Blues in my hand. It blew me away! The sound clips above are too short to do this CD justice, but you really should pick this one up. Chris Thomas King combines Blues and Hip Hop in a insightful and meaningful way and pours his heart, mind, and soul into every track. This isn't easy listening music and some will no doubt find it too political (translation: too black) or not in accordance to their narrow concept of Blues, but for me this is just what the doctor ordered. More people need to know about the man and his music. Help spread the word."
1,MouthBreathers,"Yea, you are really dense arent ya. Have any of you actually looked at any of his other material, cause if u had you would realise that this kid is the future of Delta blues. He has one of the most haunting voices of anyone i have ever heard. This is the only cd like it in his library, the rest is either straight blues or slightly experimental blues. you guys know about experimenting, yea its that thing that forces music to move on and evolve. You are all really really ignorant.oh and by the way, No white guys short of Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughn should EVER sing the blues. Chicago blues crap, its a lie and its way to white.to quote George Carlin ""what do white people have to be blue about, Banana Republic ran out of Khakis, Hootie and the Blowfich are breaking up!!"""
2,I NOR THE KIDS QUITE GOT THIS ONE,"I did give this one two stars because the art work is rather good. After reading this and then reading it to the class, I had to come to the conclusion that it is simply boring. I still do not quite get what the author is trying to do here and the childern certainly did not. All I saw while reading it to them was puzzled looks, eyes rolling to the back of their heads and yawns. Cannot recommend this one."
4,Great Music,"I love the music for InuYasha [better than the show]. The first 6 songs are new; didn't appear on Best of InuYasha I. But the rest of the album is diappointing, filled with the 90sec End Credit versions of all the music.Angelus is the very best on here. Come by Amuro Namie is really good too, but I bought the singles."
3,"Songs were good, but couldn't play them on itunes","I liked most of the songs on the cd, but it had a lot of the tv size version of the songs, and only a couple with the full version. The only thing that I didn't like about this cd was that I couldn't play it on my itunes or transfer it into my ipod. I'm not sure if it said anything like that in the description, but yeah, that was the only drawback. otherwise, songs were really good, and were nice to listen to (on my laptop)."
5,"If you're a fan, definitely worth it.","I'm a long-time fan of InuYasha, and have enjoyed the series for years. I've always thought the music used in this music is remarkable. I was given this CD as a Christmas present a few years ago, and I was AMAZED. It had all the tracks from the series I would've liked.If you're a fan of this series and the music of the anime,it's DEFINITELY worth your money."
5,If were specifically looking for the CD and songs included,"The CD was great! It was what I was looking for and more. The only draw back during the process, was that they sent me the wrong CD at first. I immediately sent in back and they sent me the correct CD. I can't wait to share the CD with my friends overseas, they'll love it!"
1,Beware copy protection,Beware this CD it comes with copy protection software that doesn't uninstall. It replaces 4 system DLL's with it's own. Also you can't rip this CD you can only use the supplied music player.I recommend staying a country mile away from this CD.
2,inuyasha,did not realize dialogue would not be in english? the music is fine with no english but the dialogue should be in english like i hear it on my dvd's i have the whole collection very sad with this order only
5,A must have for the N2DEEP fan,this album is tight. a little old skool but some tracks are classics. pick this one up at least for the collection
4,For Smiths obsessives everywhere,"If what you want is a song-by-song breakdown of how each song was written or recorded, then this is the book for you. Some may argue that if you want such a thing then you also need some sort of therapy, but so be it, I enjoyed it.It is well researched, but at times it's apparent that the author only had access to Joyce & Rourke, so it's a bit skewed towards their viewpoint and occasionally he is in danger of exhausting his supply of superlatives for describing what are at times, basic drum patterns, for example.But that all said, there is some interesting details about the split and more details than you'll ever need about some of the best songs ever written or recorded by anyone, anywhere."
3,Didn't diminish my boner,"What a crazy cat that James Kochalka is. When he's not writing and drawing philisophical comics about whether making comics is an art, a craft, or a science, he might be doing daily four-panel journal strips depicting his trials and tribulations as a father, husband, and cartoonist. Or, he might do a goofy comic about a frog with a boner who has a friend who's a rabbit. Who the heck knows. This isn't my favorite Kochalka project, but I did laugh out loud. Here's to you, James Kochalka!"
5,twisted little story of a frog and his budding sexuality,"Terrific book - consists of a series of little vignettes that are perversely funny.Star of the show, Funky, is pleased to show off his ""personal growth"" to any and all beings that he encounters. When we finally encounter Uncle Funky (and his cane) the story takes a surprising twist. The Bunnies with Speetcsh Immpedwaments are perpetually clueless (sort of like a Greek Chorus, but fuzzier)It is good that it promotes the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, because some knucklehead will probably sue.Great art, in a wonderfully subversive, terrific book."
3,How Does The Brain Work vs. Mind Games,"NOVA Science Now: How Does The Brain Work? like National Geographic's Brain Games shows how the brain can be fooled if we lose concentration. Brain Games does the same thing. Both use tricks to show how easy it is to fool someone. Neither DVD set gives the information I want to know about the human brain.Instead I recommend NOVA's Secrets of the Mind hosted by Dr. V.S. Ramachandran, which goes much deeper into subjects such as phantom limb syndrome,intense spiritual experiences and how the brain rewires itself. See my review of NOVA Secrets of the Mind."
3,Typical mid-90s metal,"Widowmaker's follow-up record ""Stand By For Pain"" sounds almost nothing like their debut ""Blood And Bullets"". While the core of the band is still intact, Widowmaker dropped the melodic rock sounds of the debut, and opted for a more mid-90s style of metal.To be totally honest, i'm not sure how it is that most people don't think this album sounds grunge. This album is heavily influenced by the 90s alt/grunge sound, and to think otherwise is just turning an oblivious eye to the facts. While I am no fan of alt/grunge music, Widowmaker didn't make a half bad record. The sound is more doom and gloom than I like, but Dee does manage to drop some monster tracks on ""Stand By For Pain"". My favorite tracks are ""Long Gone"", Killing Time"", ""Ready To Fall"" and ""Stand By For Pain"".This album is definitely not must-have, but I can see how you could find something here to like."
3,Half the album is good,"Half the songs on the album are good. There are five bad songs. It's nineties metal sounding. I don't like any of Dee Snider's solo albums, so I can't say it's better or worse than ""Blood and Bullets,"" ""Never Let the Bastards Wear You Down,"" or ""Desperado."""
4,Not the same old song and dance,"I remember buying this when it came out. After 'Blood And Bullets' this was an album that took a few listens to get comfortable with. I haven't listened to this recently, but 'The Iron Road' is the only song with that ""old school"" metal sound. This album presents a much more vicious sounding Widowmaker. They did a great job with this one. Too bad it was their last. After the first one and then this one I was interested to hear the direction a third album would have taken. The entire band is solid throughout. Definitely recommended for a metal collection. Don't expect another 'Blood And Bullets', though, but give it a chance..."
2,Widowmaker? Dee Snider was on the way out after Stay Hungry,"Maybe I'm one of the few people who believe that Dee Snider was on the way out after Stay Hungry. This album is nothing more than second-rate Stone Temple Pilots. Sure, Dee Snider is heavier and more aggressive on this album- but he should realize that his 15 minutes at the top is over. He broke through with Stay Hungry and it's a shame that Twisted Sister failed to stand the test of time. Influential videos earned Twisted Sister their place in history- but ""Thriller"" clearly remains the best video of all-time, although I think it's ""November Rain"" from Guns N' Roses. If I were you, I would pass on this album and get Twisted Sister instead."
4,USE AS FIRST AID KIT,"I bought 3 clear bags in different shapes to see which one I would prefer. I made first aid kits for upstairs, downstairs and the car. I like the clear because you can easily see what you're looking for.I use the smaller clear cosmetic bag for my purse so I don't have to dig around and can spot the shade of lipstick I need quickly.I prefer the rectangular shaped tote - height is just right and holds a lot of product.It's amazing with two messy teens, that I've been able to keep the bathroom organized by using these clear bags. WooHoo!"
3,Rather small,"The clear totes (I ordered two) not only appear much smaller coming out of the box. Once unfolded, you'll find the measurements of the bags about an inch smaller"
2,Not so hot!,Thought that I would love this product...did for about 3 days then the main zipper broke! Not worth the money I paid! Very disappointed!
5,Techno-dance beats with industrial trance edge,"Robert Gorl is one of the originators of the electronic dance/industrial Genre. He founded DAF in the early 80's with Gabi. DAF stands for Deutsche Americana Freudenschaft, or German American Friendship. I have been a fan and follower of Gorl from the early days. This album is a dark rhythymic journey for true believers in power beats and electronic syncopation. In Sexdrops, Gorl travels into thoughtful challenges to techno-trance with pure instrumental ""songs"". Not for the faint hearted. Listen to this album to find out where post-dance industrial is going."
5,Lasting,"Haven't listened to them in over a decade. Still, had a dream last night with their ""American Tune"" as background music. Some recordings of songs are worth taking along with you even if just in your head. This is one of them. And where else are you going to hear ""and a good piece of soul is hard to find?"" [Rear View Mirror] Thanks SVB!"
3,Afternoon Delight,"If there ever was a love song for the disco area it was this in the summer of 1976 when disco was still innocent and new. This song has some of the best harmonies of the 70's. I do not like country music but they blended the country sound with such a likable folk pop swing. If only they would have gotten better material to match this song I would have given 5 stars. But I do give 5 stars to the song ""Afternoon Delight"" There are few songs you can listen to over and over again and be moved internally. The band consisted of 4 individuals (2 woman, 2 men) who then married each other and later divorced when success did not follow the peak of ""Afternoon Delight"" a number 1 song winning 2 Grammy's in 1976. What a movie one could make about the quick success and fall of this group. They even had a TV variety show for a short time because of afternoon delight. Matt W. Young"
3,afternoon delight,A little disappointed bought as a gift case was busted and cover looked like it was printed in somebody's basement but it played and husband liked it.
4,One Hit Wonder..,"Well.. not really. The Starland Vocal Band had a couple of great hits, but the one they're most remembered for is Afternoon Delight. As a kid I remember listening to this song on the car radio. This is an awesome song by a not very memorable band.Gonna find my baby.. Gonna hold her tight.. Gonna grab some afternoon delight.."
5,Been searching a long time,I too had this album in 1978 and have always loved the sound of this group. But all my LP's were destroyed in a flood. I am so grateful to find this and many other hard to find albums. Any one who ever sang in the 70's should have a listen !
4,The result of a 23 year search,I can review this album from the original copy I had in 1978. As I enjoy Acapella music ( whether I can spell it or not) I really enjoyed St. Croix Silent Night and have been searching for a new copy since 1978...to no avail ( due to the relative obscurity of the album) until now. Looking forward to hearing it again.
1,Flabbergasted beyond belief,"I am flabbergasted to see all the 5 star reviews of this horrendously atrocious excuse for music. Bland, poorly produced, and with some of the worst songs ever written (""Afternoon Delight"" is a strong contender for the worst song of all time) this is the kind of ""music"" that makes elevator music sound cutting edge. That this remains in print is one of the saddest commentaries on popular culture that I have come across in some time."
1,Flabbergasted,"I am flabbergasted to see all the 5 star reviews of this horrendously atrocious excuse for music. Bland, poorly produced, and with some of the worst songs ever written (""Afternoon Delight"" is a strong contender for the worst song of all time, and their recording of Emmylou Harris's magnifiecent ""Boulder to Birmingham"" is nothing sort of desecration) this is the kind of ""music"" that makes elevator music sound cutting edge. That this remains in print is one of the saddest commentaries on popular culture that I have come across in some time."
4,Delicioso!,"Every cookbook should be loaded with pictures like this one is. This book has a great sampling of dishes from all over Mexico, and helpful substitutions for hard to find ingredients. Not only are the recipes great, but the history behind the dishes are interesting also. I found most of the recipes require a lot of preparation time, however that is due more to the nature of Mexican cooking. I haven't found a bad recipe yet in the whole book."
5,And you thought only Chinese had so many different dishes!,"Beautiful, authentic, mouth-watering, incredible--and that just describes the pictures! An incredible sampling of classic Mexican cuisine from many different levels reflecting the essential character of the people and their wonderful culture. In fact, the true irony is that authentic Mexican food is as complex in its origens as are its people. The result nevertheless is nothing short of extraordinary. These magical recipes are relatively easy to duplicate with ingredients easily available if you look."
5,oh-my-gawd awesome!,"I'm one of those pathetic Indians who never learned to cook well before leaving India. This book was such a kick for me. It has beautiful pictures . . .nostalgia central . . .hand me the tissues! The recipes are infallible and instructions clear. Unlike some of the other indian cookbooks (madhur Jaffrey for example who I do adore) it doesnt have an ingredient list a mile long for each dish. And, best of all, it has some of the recipes you never find in an indian cookbook written for people abroad; the food sold in the street vendor stalls, the dozens of different types of dal depending on the state you come from, pickle recipes and lovely chapters of history, culture, etc. There are also little blurbs about indian customs and traditions scattered throughout the book and it ends up being my favorite kind of cookbook, the ones you can read for an hour even if you arent planning to cook."
5,Wonderful recipes.. beautiful book,"If you enjoy Indian cuisine, you will love this book. The recipes are excellent and the photographs are breathtaking!Having read every Indian cookbook in our library system, this is the one I return to again and again."
4,"Crosstown Beef, butter baby","This track blazes. The beat's tight...flow's money. If you dig Mob Deep or Group Home this track is the bomb. Nothing like tribe son, get it straight god. Best get Sound Bombing 2, this might be one of the best tracks on the whole jam. Medina Green's got skills and teaming up with Mos Def you can't go wrong."
3,BEWARE....,"This title is great, Mildred Larson is an authority and she deserves all my professional respect but there were no HINT in the description that this workbook uses THE BIBLE as source book. I teach translation in Mexico and religion is such an incendiary topic. I wish there was another version of this workbook, using material different from religious topics."
1,Inaccurate Description,"Beware, the description and photograph here....it fails to show that the Bible is the point of reference and all exercises. I will be returning this."
2,Mighty Machines at the Construction Site Lacks Variety,"I bought this video for my two year old son. He loves all kinds of trucks and can name different ones in his board books. This video was disappointing because it had no variety and was boring. It focused mostly on excavators and cranes, with only a quick glimpse of a bull dozer and fork lift. It did not keep my son's interest."
5,A must-buy,"I thoroughly recommend the purchase of this book to anyone engaged in the study of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as it almost functions as a ""bible"" of standard spectra for the elements. I also like the simple summary of the technique which actually includes a lot of information that would be hard to tease out of the overly technical texts on XPS that are around. For Universities and Research Institutes who have personnel experienced in XPS or who have the instrumentation, it is an essential purchase"
5,"A ""hard case"" from childhood through death.","The uniquely direct style of Jeffrey Meyers is a most suitable tool for examining this uniquely blunt man. Some startling parallels exist in the lives of Bogart and Hemingway. Bogart's bravery in facing a painful death is remarkably well-told and provides the most important insights into the man's inner soul. Bogart would no doubt be pleased, amused and enraged at this in-depth treatment of his life and legacy."
1,Lots of errors...,"As a long-time Bogart fan, I was very disappointed in the sloppy research in this book. The best thing about the book is the pictures."
2,Only good for smooth wood - Left wool everywhere,"I got this for staining my deck. Mostly to stain the spindles.I found that this mitt is made stronger than the cheep ones I got down at the discount warehouse hardware store and it is lined so you do not need to wear a glove, but there is a big problem. The mitt leaves pieces of wool everwhere.It would be fine if used on a flat / smooth surface like wood that has been sanded - but not on rough wood as you have on a deck.The rough wood rips the wool apart leaving it everywhere.The cheepo's work better on rough wood."
1,Amateurish,"Publishers must be scraping barrels for works like this to get into print. I fail to see how anyone could identify with the main character, and therefore care what happens to him. People don't talk like that, people don't act like that (or if they do, I don't want to meet them). Contrived, unbelievable plot, and cardboard caricature characters. Associating Mozart with this book is sacrilege."
1,Nightmare Music,"While this book contained many interesting facts, the plot was so far fetched as to make it laughable. I did finish it, but what a waste of time!"
5,Being an Amature Mozart Lover...,"I picked up this novel, not having any training in classical music. I just know good, soul-stirring music when I hear it and Mozart's compositions ""do it"" for me. What does this have to do with this book you might say? Remarkably enough, Slater manages to describe, in the written word, what one experiences when listening to moving Mozart piece. The love and passion for Mozart and his works, results in some interesting, even bizzare human behavior on the part of the characters in the book. One wonders how evil, murder and mystery can evolve out of something so beautiful as ""Night Music"". Harrison Slater's book shows us how.Highly recommended, whether you're an expert on Mozart, or a novice like myself."
4,The Cow Who Wouldn't Come Down,I recommend that you read this book because how the author can tell you how they think and how you have to think what Miss Rosemary will do next.Plus itis funny to watch her mess up.
3,Nice job for author/illustrator's first book.,"Paul Brett Johnson did a good job on his first written and illustrated book. The pictures portray an old woman, bun and all, trying to convince her cow Gertrude, who has a mind of her own, to come down from flying over the farm. She tries to allure her with hay, tries to catch her with a fishing pole and misses when she gets on the roof to grab the cows tail as it flies by. Finally, the old woman plans something tricky and out wits the cow. This is a cute story. My favorite line is, 'Miss Rosemary hadn't the slightest notion how to milk a flying cow.'"
1,The Cow Who Wouldn't Come Down,I would not recommend this book.Because it was not my kind of book.I like chapter books and i also like different kinds of animals especially hamsters.
4,The best notebook but it seems to have changed...,"I have always loved these notebooks. I have over 15 of these on my shelf with over a decade of thoughts and notes. Why 4 stars instead of 5? It appears that the maker of these books has switched to a new paper that has some recycled paper in it. Saving the environment is good, but this new paper is inferior. I use Uniball Vision pens, which are liquid ink pens. The new paper has significantly more bleed through than the older paper. I complained to the company, but I never got a response.I don't have a good replacement for these books with a better paper. I suppose I will need to find another type of pen to use with the book.The smaller size really promotes more use than the larger letter size. I have a pile of the letter sized ones, since they make taping printouts into them easier, but as I write this review, I'm thinking of switching back to the smaller size."
5,Standard notebook,"I've tried many a lab notebook since I am a big fan of taking lots of notes. This is the best. Lies flat, pre-numbered, durable, nice. Comes in two sizes -- the full page size accommodates pasted in sheets if you trim the edges off. The smaller size is great too. I believe it also comes quad ruled or lined--I have only gotten lined."
1,Truely the worst service I have had,"DO NOT USE VONAGE. The call quality is poor with buzzing and feedback. The voice messsage, maintained on Vonage equipment is choppy and they can't fix it. They just tell you to unplug and the plug in the router---to no avail. Customer Service is wait on hold for 42 minutes, get disconnected, call back, speak to a guy in India that has no clue about helping you, get disconnected, call back wait 24 minutes, get ""escalated"" to no where and then get an e-mail saying to troubleshoot on their web site, when the website says call in. Try to cancel, they charge you for termination fees and keep charging you for monthly service after having service disconnected. THEY WILL WRECK YOU PHONE SYSTEM AND YOUR CREDIT AT THE SAME TIME !"
2,"Decent performance with one caveat, brutal technical support","The setup was quite easy, and voice quality is decent. However, I can only place outgoing calls; calls to ""my"" number are routed to someone else. I won't fault Vonage for the technical problem itself. However, the response of their technical support is unacceptable; each of the four times that I have called, I have been told that they would look into it and get back to me by email. They have never done so. If you're considering Vonage, look online at the experiences of other users; I don't think that my experience is uncommon.UPDATE (Feb. 17, 2008): Shortly after my original review, and after another phone call, this problem was resolved by technical support by switching me to another number. Subsequently, I have not had to think about my phone line except when paying the bills, which is exactly what most customers want."
1,Absolutely no customer service,"The service works well . . . most of the time. However, if you have a problem, Vonage doesn't want to know about it. I've waited up to an hour on hold to get a tech rep and forget about e-mail support - they just don't answer. Now I want to cancel and they're going to charge me a cancellation fee! My advice is to wait until they work out a few more bugs and get over their growing pains."
1,"Great Product, Terrible Support","I recently installed Vonage and it worked great for a couple days. The sound quality is surprisingly good.Two days ago, the service stopped working altogether (I get a dial tone, but all calls end in a fast busy signal). I have made 3 calls to support and each time I was forwarded to a recorded message saying they are too busy to take my call. I have also sent three emails to support. I have not received a response to any of my inquiries. Now I am without phone service and it is impossible to get help.This could be a great service, but I would recommend staying away for now."
1,Customer Service is not good after purchase,"I have had this item since June 2002. After the initial setup, customer service doesn't not call you back. I signed someone else up and they are having the same problem. Too bad because the service is pretty good."
2,The ups and downs (mostly downs) of Vonage,"I bought Vonage service 7 months ago. When it works (not as often as I'd like), it's terrific. When it doesn't (too often), it's a nightmare. I have had most of the problems already mentioned in other reviews, but the worst one of all is that I forward my Vonage line to my cell phone whenever I'm not home. The call gets forwarded, but messages don't. I am told that I have a 6-second message, and there is never a voice. Customer service (or customer neglect would be a better term) has been working on it for weeks. They have actually made the situation worse. Moral of the story: you get what you pay for. And it's too bad, because I was very favorably disposed to Vonage."
1,Miserable failure,"We got Vonage to save on the outrageous BellSouth commercial line fees and because BellSouth's customer service is so lousy.Unfortunately, the Vonage system has such lousy service quality(dropped calls, echos, delays) that it's just not viable for a small business. Reliability is at or below what you would get from a cell phone (while driving through a rural area).Their customer service seems to range from average to lousy in my experience. Also, as a small business, it was important that we be able to get a ""block"" of numbers. Not only could we not get a block, we were assigned different exchanges (the 3 digits after the area code). When we asked to at least be put under the same exchange, they told us to use the web site to do it (for which there is a charge of $10.00 per change).Here are your options:LOCAL PHONE: Bad customer service, high prices, reliable signalVONAGE: ? customer service, low prices, unreliable signal"
1,The Worst Experience EVER,That one star is not deserved. It should be many stars in the negative. Good luck cancelling your service even after a year. They kept billing until I finally cancelled the card. No one should have to go through days and weeks on the phone just to cancel a service.
5,Great for so many things,"Vonage has given me the ability to talk to all my long distancew friends for a flat fee. I am in NJ, our son is in CA and my parents are in FL. I can talk to all of them for as long as I want and never get charged more than the flat fee. This is a great product for people with kids in college or have parents that do not live in the same area. Great second line option."
1,Vonage Service Review,"Vonage service is twice costly compared to Sunrocket. The Linksys WRTP54G failed in just 7 months.Don't buy Vonage service. Lot of complications to deal with once you get into trouble with the devices. They don't have a contract but they charge you $40 to cancel service. Now that's a mental torture.Then they have a distinct entity to cancel services which remains only open for few hours on working days and they promise a credit which does never get reflected on your statement. Then when you call back they say they don't have notes it. Where's the value of the word they give.The customer service has sweet sound but they will waste your time by making things complicated, till the point you say why the hell did you get into this one. The opportunity cost of time wasted in dealing with Vonage is too high.Plain and simple don't get a Vonage Service. Cost of cancelling out may be pay for getting a cheaper and simpler service.All negative stars.Oh, its such a pain !!!!"
3,Good when not using other broadband functions,This is a decent phone service at a great price. Performance becomes almost unusable if you are using your computer for a bandwidth-intensive function (like Webex) at the same time.Customer service also needs a TON of improvement.
5,Try and believe,"I hooked up to vonage directly through the website (you can get different packages/monthly rates). I'm running the service over cable with roadrunner. Setup is incredibly easy, voice quality superb. There seem to be some telephone company loyalists on the review boards trying to scare you off with electricity cost (<10Watt) and sound delays. I call long distance quite a bit including international and was amazed with the clarity and ease of conversations (no delays!). Best of all, no more long distance bills or extortion from SBC. Overall, I'm saving about hundred bucks a month. Try it, you'll like it."
5,Great service!,"I've had Vonage for a couple months now and never had any problems with it, besides maybe a few echos on the other callers end. And that seems almost unnoticable to them. But for the price, it is way worth it. I've never had any problems with dropped calls.There are people that I call across state and in others states that would normally charge us long distance. It is all treated as a local call. There are friends of the family that use this and everybody that we know that has it, loves it.As for my experience, besides the almost un-noticable echo every now and then, the quality is great!"
1,Stay Away from Vonage,"I bought vonage service thinking that finally there is a company which will let me control everything from their web portal, and provide features that traditional phone companies do not. Good thing I kept my number with traditional phone company and got a second line with Vonage.Its voice quality was really bad, and cancelling it was a pain to say the least. It took me 4 months to cancell it. Waiting forever on hold. Please read internet forums/blogs before you decide to ""save"" money."
1,Vonage Sucks Hard,"I feel that Vonage totally sucks. I got the service in mid November.It never worked at all for the phone number that was the wholereason I got Vonage. So I finally got fed up with dealing withcustomer service and canceled online. Well, apparently you can'tcancel online. So no that I'm back (Jan, 5th) I saw the email saying tocall and I did. The guy in cancelations told me that he was sendingme to credits so that they could credit me for this month's service.The guy in credits told me that according to his screen I canceledtoday and there is nothing he can do for me. I asked to speak with asupervisor and he told me that there is no supervisor. I feel that theyshould credit me pro rated from December 12th, when I canceledonline, but even if they can't they should credit me pro rated fromtoday!! I had to pay a full month for five days of service that I didn'tuse at all. I'd say people got through about 25% of the time.Vonage Sucks!!"
2,Great product as long as you don't need support,"I've been using the Vonage service and my normal phone to make calls and have been very impressed with phone call quality. I have seen others complain about the delay, but I don't think it really affects the quality of most phonec calls. Yes there is a delay. No, most people won't notice the delay in a normal conversation.A bigger issue, however, is Vonage support. I have had no Vonage dial tone for two days. Calls to their support # have ended in a ""we are too busy to take your call, please leave a message."" These messages, as well as three emails, have gone unanswered. The result is that I have no phone service and no way to speak to anyone to fix the problem. This, I believe, is Vonage's critical flaw.When support is fixed and the service becomes reliable, this will be a great product. Until then, stay away."
1,The service was lousy and the support was even more lousy,I bought vonage service from them directly.It came after 7 days and got the service connected. The service was really bad. Had lot of static and basically the call quality was lousy. I thought it could be some bad bandwidth problems. I waited and finally couldnt use it any more. So I disconnected the service and they slapped me with a 40 dollar fee and 80 dollar equipment fee for a refurbished modem.I called them and rep didnt have any answers and I asked for the supervisor and apparently they are in a meeting on saturday morning. I requested them to call back. Have to see what the supervisor says.
1,Be warned!,"We switched to Vonage to save money and it was the worst quality, customer service ever. All our calls would be dropped after 5 minutes and the second time I called to have it ""fixed"" they managed to do something that cause us to not be able to receive incoming calls for over 2 weeks. No refunds were offered and I am having to PAY THEM to cancel my service! Read the Better Business Bureau reports. If these reviews don't convince you that will. Just sorry I didn't check into the service more."
2,"It's OK, BUT......","I found that many of the questions at the back of the ""chapters"" (if that is what you could call them, I would call them OUTLINES)were not address in the chapters. THIS BOOK SHOULD ONLY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A SUPPLIMENT ONLY. Do not think that this book will teach you all you need to know."
3,It's a good book,"I have studied this book for two hours avery day for two years. I'm not joking, it's a class for school. I went to take the exam and I passed but I felt that they did not cover enough Networking stuff. They should emphasize more in this part. I also used the Windows 95 Resource Kit to study and that hepled to clear out the missing networking piecies in my puzzle."
3,This book used with transcenders and prayers should be okay,"I used this book to study for my windows 95 70 064 exams.I scored 734(cut off 632).This book by the nature of its presentation gave me an excellent comprehension of Windows 95.When I started final exam revision with transenders I did well but also found the book did not treat fax,windows messaging and dial-up networking well."
1,There are better books out there,"I found this book rather confusing. Many of the stuff covered in the book was not needed and there are many needed materials that are not covered at all in the book. There are a lot of technical errors in the book and I feel like many of the sample questions in the book simply tried to trap you and humiliate you instead of giving you an idea how the real exam questions are like. If you are counting this book as your only resource to prepare for the exam, good luck!"
3,A good start,"This book is a good starting point for the newly revised Windows 95 (70-064) exam. I just took it and scored 857 (minimum passing score is 632). The book goes into detail on topics that are heavily covered on the exam (networking with NT and NetWare, printing, system policies), and this makes it a great place to start studying. However, the 95 exam is full of nitpicky questions that are NOT covered in this book; you need additional sources to be completely prepared. In addition to buying this book, I'd recommend downloading the Win95 Resource Kit from Microsoft's Web site and spending some time going through it, especially troubleshooting. Also search the web for ""70-064"" to turn up helpful links. This is one of the hardest exams in the MCSE sequence, but if you use these sources you should be in good shape."
5,Couldn't have passed the exam without it,"I bought the Que Win95 TestPrep book with two weeks until the exam. This being my first exam, I had no idea what to expect. Because there was so many questions, it prepared me for any question that the exam might ask. I would have never passed the exam without this book, it is a lifesaver. The Net Essentials equivalent is also a very good book"
2,Lots of Questions; Lots of Errors; Little Else,"This is a cheap book with lots and lots of sample exam questions, but many, way too many errors -- dozens! Wrong answers. Answers that contradict the text on its own pages earlier in the book, and repeated questions on the same topic (at least once with two different answers!) And explanatory text on the various exam topics is nearly non-existent at times and very erratic in its depth of coverage."
4,An enjoyable read,"A non-fiction memoir that reads like fiction! It's relatively fast paced, comfortably wraps in the family issues without dwelling too too much on them and gives you a great look at the 'other' side of reporting. I enjoyed this book very much!"
5,Touching Memoir,"I've been a fan of Anderson Cooper for quite a long time now, and was happy he was finally writing a book. His accounts were touching and moving...I only wish this book had been longer.I shall hope we hear from him again soon...I know he has to have many more stories to tell."
4,Wonderful way to help all of us never forget,"This book is one that I found absolutely moving. I love hearing and reading about other people's struggles and hard times and how they have learned to overcome them. Because then I realize that no matter what I am going through it can end and I can come out of it an even more miraculous person.Anderson Cooper does just that and more in this amazing read. It helps me remember the horrible things that have and are happening to my fellow Americans and also to the other members of the human race. ""Dispatches form the Edge"" helps me remember to appreciate all I've got, to help those that ask and also those who don't and to remember all of their stories.I gave it 4 stars due only to the harsh language used in Anderson's dialogue. This didn't necessarily affect the books message or content, people swear, I get it. But it is just something I don't personally agree with. The only retrobution Mr. Cooper gets is a missing star...boohoo :)"
4,Engaging,"It's true that Cooper does jump around quite a bit in his writing; to me, the structure of the memoir enhanced the purpose of the story, which was to convey to the readers the buildup of thought and emotion surrounding the terrible things Cooper has witnessed in his life and career.I found the stories completely engaging, if for no other reason than to remind me that there are places in the world that are far from comfortable and where people have to fight to survive.I definitely recommend this memoir; it is honest, heartbreaking, and well written."
4,AC-Dispatches from the Edge,"I was watching CNN one night when I realized I knew little about Anderson Cooper but I knew he would have an interesting back story to him. That same night I decided to order his book to learn more about CNN's mystery man. Sure enough I learned a lot about what he has endured both in his career and in his personal life. To be honest, I found the book interesting because of the different point of view on much of the world disasters that he experiences. I gave it 4 stars because I found so much of it repetitive that it turned me off slightly, not too often. This might be different for other readers and is probably just me. But I would recommend it to anyone because he deserves to have his story told after what he has witnessed and suffered so we could be informed."
4,Dispatches from the edge,"I was impressed with this book. I've found Anderson Cooper to be a very informative correspondent, and he brings real life interest to his travel reports. I try to watch him regularly."
3,A Decent Read,"I didn't know much about Anderson Cooper before reading this book and assumed I would gain insight into the man as well as his thoughts and feelings at particular critical moments in history such as Katrina and the tsunami. I did get some of this but was left feeling dissatisfied. He holds his cards pretty close to his chest. Or else he still suffers from the numbness he writes about as though it is past tense. Near the beginning, Cooper assures us or himself, I'm not clear which, that he's not like some other journalists who get a ""high"" off of war, suffering, and danger. Yet the rest of the book proves that indeed he does. He seems to need this high to feel much of anything, including empathy for those who are suffering from war, famine, or disaster. Maybe this detachment is what makes him good at what he does and brave enough to do it. But if you're looking for a read containing insight and reflection, you may need to wait for Cooper's sequel."
3,Do you have the time to listen to me whine?,"The audio version of Dispatches is very well written and very well read.Cooper is deeply thoughtful and his descriptions are vivid. He shares with us here a ""slice"" of his unique life.The only real problem is that the work reads like one long (6 hour) suicide note.The brooding depression is unrelenting, worthy of an Anne Rice novel.The happy peppy music at the beginning and ending of each disk seems abruptly out of place when Cooper was just speaking about bloated floating corpses.I am certain Cooper is not ALWAYS this tragic in real life.He seems like a very intelligent person to whom a lot of good things have happened."
3,Tried a bit too much,"I am a diehard Anderson Cooper fan! But this book is not that good. I was easily distracted by all the descriptions he used when it was rather unnecessary. It felt like he was trying to hard to grasp the reader's attention and sound interesting. At times, I felt like I was trudging along because his stories were so muddied with adjective after adjective. Looking past that, the stories were great, I loved his message, and I love how compassionate and open he is when retelling all that he has seen and felt in the past years."
4,very interesting,I love his style of writing. It was very easy to read and most interesting on how he got his start and the stories he covered. Some of itwas difficult to read at times but well worth it. I would have liked to learn more about his background though.
5,Wonderful,"Wonderful book! Amazing, can't say enough good things. It's raw and truthful, Anderson Cooper bares his soul for us. Amazing work!"
4,Pretty Good,"AC's book is extremely readable, but too short; it's only about 200 pages; twice the length would have been good. The best parts by far are those about his own life. His descriptions of his brother's suicide and the effect it had on him are pretty devasating. Likewise the parts where he details his father's influence on him. But, as much as I want to give this 5 stars, I was slightly disappointed. Cooper provides an insight into his own life, but he keeps a great deal to himself. This may be fair enough, but at the start of the book it seems as if he's about to embark on a journey of self-revelation, but only ever gets halfway."
2,disappointed,"I found this uninteresting and boring. He dwells on the suicide of his brother throughout the whole book. enough already, Anderson! Let him go. The rest of the book is depressing enough. Now I know why I left CNN for Fox!"
1,Save Your Money,Another guilt-infused liberal who bleeds all over the place while lining his pockets with money. He's probably working on the sequel right now. Let's hope for more natural disasters and wars to Andy can keep telling us how he feels so much more than us mortals.
3,What is the Point?,"2005 was an extraordinary year in the life of Anderson Cooper (and many others). Cooper spent time in Sri Lanka following the tsunami, in Iraq, among the starving in Niger, and in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.His ""Dispatches from the Edge"" relates a few vignettes from each of those dispatches, intertwined with earlier similar experiences elsewhere (eg. Kosovo, Somali, other hurricanes) and his own life (the death of his father as an outgrowth of cardiac surgery while he was ten, and the suicide of his two-year-older brother).So what is the reader to gain from this? Not much, other than his observations that he was building a career on the misery of others, and that in every disaster there always was someone making money.[...]obviously, he has built a successful career and made good money from other people's disasters. I guess that is the point."
4,Dispatches from the edge,"A great read, Wasn't really a big fan of Anderson Cooper before this, but I read the whole book in one sitting, really interesting, easy to follow and not hard work at all.A great book, for an interesting insight into a very interesting man"
4,Edgy Dispatches from the Inner Self,"This autobiography was well written and fascinating for its insights into the natural disasters that Cooper writes about. I think it would have been a stronger book had Cooper provided more details about the situations he encountered and less self-revelation--particularly the metaphorical bits, though he does engage the reader's sympathy."
4,Anderson's Memoir,"This memoir did manage to keep me reading until late at night. Though very interesting, I wish that Anderson would have spoken more about his ""love life"". The book begs the question...'does he have a ""significant other?' ... It does not answer the question.All in all, a great book."
4,"""And forget about closure, there is no such thing.""","I'm watching Oprah, wanting to learn more about the silver-haired guy I learned to love (watching) during CNN's Hurricane Katrina coverage. I had no idea that Anderson Cooper's mother is Gloria Vanderbilt, and that he had such tragedy in his young life. Being a nonfiction writer myself, I've always leaned toward truth over fabrication when it comes to my personal reading because we all have so much to learn from each other when it comes to dealing with what life throws our way. No matter what I'm about to read in the pages of Mr. Cooper's memoir, I'm happy to do it because the outcome of his story is a warm and caring journalist who brings humanity to even the most horrific of stories."
3,Dispatches from the Edge,"I felt the book was a collection of uncensored news reports and I don't watch the news because it is so one-sided. I did not understand how he continuously referred to the death of his father and his brother's suicide. I mean, they kept resurfacing throughout the book but, the events did not seem to have any impact on the career path of the author. I did not appreciate the raw depiction of the world events at large, albeit, he was very honest and forthright in his presentation. What I got out of the book was they way society on the whole is short-sighted and not stayed on the memory of past atrocities and mistakes much of which the media sensationalizes until the well runs dry or something new comes along. Then, the new events take the forefront and even the horrific recent past is forgotten."
2,Dispatches from the Edge,"I sympathized with him on the book. I felt that there was too much alternating from one country to the next to then a family rememberance. I did not think the book was written well. While reading the book, yes you want to go to the next chapter, but then towards the last 45 pages it is like well we pretty much know all about all of that, (those of us that follow the news) and it is not a surprise. I truly felt that he had to present this book to the public in order to tell his story and heal. There is nothing wrong with this, however, it was very emotional & intimate & confusion more than I ever expected."
2,"Although a fan of Cooper, can't recommend this book","Save your money and read the excerpt in Vanity F. magazine. I really wanted to like this book as I am a fan of Mr. Cooper's style of reporting. In this book he reports on various wars he happened to be front and center. They seem to run in to each other and as hard as I tried to be engaged in the stories I found the writing style too clinical. Mr. Cooper does not discuss his personal life only the effects of his father's death and his brother's suicide. He tries, unsuccessfully to intergrate those deaths into the stories of death that war causes. If one is going to write a biography one should discuss one's life and address some of the questions circulating (i.e his homosexuality). Hopefully, Mr. Cooper will one day write a serious autobiography. This isn't it. The excerpt in Vanity F. sums up the book and is all you really need."
3,my life so far( is better than yours),"Mr. cooper should wait until he's really scene it all . At 38 their isn't much life yet, as the book is 200 some odd pages,and should try later in life."
1,The elephant in the room...,"Anderson Cooper manages to talk about everything else in this book EXCEPT the pink elephant in the room he refuses to acknowledge.The constant bleating of ""Oh, I'm too busy to have a personal life"" in this book starts getting tiresome and transparent. The personal IS political! No man is an island, Andy!Sorry, but I like to get my news from someone authentic. Rachel Maddow does it every day...so can you, Mr. Cooper!Also, does anyone else find the Cover Picture offensive? There is a starving/crippled (?) black person struggling in the background...and Anderson is turning his back on them...smouldering towards the camera giving us his best ""Blue Steel"" pout!"
5,Brilliant On Screen and Paper,"What a treat it is to find a memoir that tells of one person's life while touching your own. I have always been in awe of Anderson Cooper's beauty and strength during traumatic events. It was not until I read his memoir that I discovered that the root of this strength is his rootlessness. In my mind, he has gone from being a reporter to a hero.Unlike other memoirs, Cooper does not praise himself anymore than he berates himself. His book is written like how he tells the news, straight and to the point. However, there is a depth and a sentimentality within him that is rarely noticed. His writing is exquisite as well as his ability to weave his personal development through his travels as a correspondent.I can't think of a single person who would be disappointed after reading this memoir."
4,Laughter and tears.,"In a numbing, sometimes funny (""These are not the droids you are looking for""), always disturbing look at Anderson Cooper's life, this short memoir is a stunning tale of the harsh life outside our safe suburban American assumptions.It's a quick read, and written well, and often times moved me to tears. Cooper writes about Somalia, Iraq, New Orleans, his older brother's death, his father's death - after a while you almost seem to grow numb to the stories, and they sound familiar. But that doesn't detract from the story. I think that's what Cooper wants us to understand: you can only hold on so long before the cracks start to break and emotion comes through. He spent so long trying to distance himself from the stories, but realized in the end that he had to let himself go to survive, like the sharks that have to keep moving to live.Highly recommended, but mentally prepare yourself for this one first: this is the real thing."
5,Speaking the Mamma Tongue,"This is an incredibly beautiful arrangement of music and voices with such diverse influences of rhythms and melodies from the Latin, African, Native American, and Indian cultures. The talented musicians and singers blend so smoothly together. My favorites are ""Face the Wind"", ""Oma Wani Yea"", and ""Vanya Don't Go Away"" although each song is unique and beautiful in it's own respect. The more I listen to this C.D. the more I love it. This C.D. is a gem to have for any serious music collector."
2,yawwwn...,"man, i was really disappointed, there was hardly anything classic about this cd, besides some of the originals trying to release ""new material""... the music was mediocre at best, the only thing cool was Mr. Armando Gallop's (RIP) voice overs, high-lighting through the history of the Chi-Town scene, but other than that...."
3,Not Bad,"This isn't the best 80's compilation out there, but it does have the songs ""Heart and Soul"" and ""Two of Hearts,"" which is why I bought it. I don't like T'Pau's other songs, and ""Heart and Soul"" is hard to find on a compilation normally. A lot of these other songs were unfamiliar to me."
3,Drink more Scotch Whisky after listening to this.,"I got this free, but it was surprisingly entertaining.At the very least it inspired me to drink more Scotch Whisky."
3,Useful Book,I bought this book as part of the research for my MA dissertation and I found it quite useful but I found it to be hard going at times. It didn't come up with much that I hadn't already come across but it would be a good resource for someone with little knowlege of Irish peacekeeping. I can't agree with some of the conclusions which seem to be based on flimsy evidence.
2,Terrible nausea,"I had terrible nausea each time I took this product. Bad enough that I couldn't really function until it went away. I took it with food, tried even just one pill from the daily pack of 3 pills. No luck. I also burped a bad taste with it regularly. It just didn't feel good to me.I stopped after probably a week's worth and gave it to a relative, who also stopped taking them before the container was finished but I didn't ask why.I have no opinion on the quality as it's hard to tell with a pill...I just know the nausea made it not worth it for me. I'm now going for whole-foods vitamins (ground up vegetables, fruits, and the like in a pill), or just eating more vegetables, which makes more sense to me anyway rather than taking a bunch of synthetic vitamins that are missing the co-factors and supporting ingredients our bodies would normally get from food."
3,complete daily pack vitamin,They are vitamins. I dont feel that these are any better than the warehouse brand multi pack vitamin. I would not purchase them again.
5,"Literally, his first classical music: and he loves it!","Yes: these are CDs of Classical TUNES, played by electronic instruments, for the most part, FOR BABIES (don't forget that, please). Not the collection you want to buy if you want to have the best of Chopin, Mozart or Brahms for yourself, but if your purpose is to soothe your baby to sleep, when we got this 3-CD-pack as a gift, we got a few more hours out of our day and our baby would fall asleep to the music in his swing. Since it's no longer in stock, you might have to get it used or dig in Ross, TJ Maxx or the likes for it. It's definitely worth it, but don't go around paying a fortune for it, as if it were a rare recording of some sorts! :)"
1,Digitally Deceiving,"""Digitally recorded, arranged and performed especially for baby, this is a perfect present for both parents and baby"" is what is deceiving about these cd's. If you are expecting to hear recordings of the original works of Mozart, Chopin, and Brahms, you won't get it at all. The selections are ""arranged"" (not clear what that's supposed to mean on the cover) for synthesizer (and a cheap sounding one at that) and are so slow that the melodies as originally composed are almost imperceptible. The arranger (who is not even mentioned on the cover) seems to think that to help babies is to give them low-budget fake sounds, add a few bells, and slow the melodies way down. Not one of the original works of the 3 composers is on these cd's. This is not the ""classical music"" we were expecting to hear. A better title would be ""ruinned classical music"" but I suppose that wouldn't sell too many cd's."
5,Tres Magnifique,"What really grabbed me at first glance was the vivid colors and attention to the details in the numerous photographs in this book.Ms. Brennan confided to me recently in a chatroom interview at the French cuisine site that she gained about ten pounds while testing the recipes for the book.The recipes are all very traditional dishes you'd find in homes and bistros all over France and are simple enough for a confident and even a new cook to recreate.Along with the delicious, hearty French recipes are little anecdotes sprinkled throughout that shed light on useful things like using creme fraiche. A perfect gift for a francophile, cook or someone who loves good classic cuisine without hours of preparation involved. The book is so vibrant and lovely you'll want to leave it on the coffee table to make your guests salivate while they wait for dinner."
3,Susan,"I have not tested it for traveling yet. I purchased it, because I needed one that would be compact for traveling. It is bigger than I thought it would be, but the fold up handle is nice. It is very durable feeling. I do not like that it is sooo loud. It was suppose to be less noise. I do like the ions feature. It does seem to make my hair shiny and give it more body. Even though it is less heat than my other blow dryer, it blows your hair dry fast and probably with less damage due to the ions."
3,Inexpensive ion travel hair dryer,"It works and seems to do quicker/better job than regular dryer. It's not as good as my more expensive full-size, but it gets the job done and is more convenient being smaller/folding handle. It's NOT quiet though!"
2,Works great.. when it's not broken!,"I like this hairdryer.. when it works! It has broken twice on me.. the first time it starting spitting out sparks so I sent it back.. they sent me a new one (of course I had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back) and now it only works on low, the high is broken.. I am going to throw it out and get a different brand.. Not impressed!!"
4,it is a good and compact hairdryer for travel.,I'm writing this review while I'm on my vacation in Germany. Let me tell you that the hairdryer is working so well in Germany. What I need was the European adapter since this is a dual voltage one.My hair is shy because the anti-static ion. I only use the low speed in Germany since the voltage here is 220V (in the US I tried it at high speed).I highly recommend this product.
2,Not happy with this at all,"I bought this in April, 2009 and it only lasted until December. In November, it started sputtering and revving. In December the heating element burned itself out. Not a very long-lived product."
2,not as good as I hoped,"The size was great but after a week it stopped, glowed bright orange and never worked again. It could have just been a lemon so I exchanged for a new one."
3,works well; too heavy for a travel dryer,Same weight as my home dryer-good power for a little dryer&like the cold shot but not worth thw weight.
3,"Short term wow, long term a little disappointing",I like this product. It is beautiful when the sun catches it. It really reflects awesome colors onto surrounding objects. I had bought one similar that was real crystal but had a cheap band which discolored. This one is sterling silver so I knew discoloring would not be an issue. However this stone is of manmade material and scratched very easily and in months looked like the stone in my other ring which took four years of everyday wear to look like that. So if you don't wear daily or make sure you take off for unlady like jobs it's worth it.
4,Cavalier 's brush,"Never thought I'd buy a special brush for a dog, but the British, informative YouTube video suggests using a soft brush to finish the coat. Well, my King Charles Cavalier Spaniel and I are both very satisfied. Didn't want the pricey kind, he is after all a dog, and this works fine. I would have given 5 stars, but personally I'm suspicious of them."
5,"My son loves , loves this book.",I read this book to my son almost everynight he just loves it.He can now name different type of airplanes just by looking at them. He's only Three.
1,Poor quality,"I purchased these for my daughter. The finish came off and we had to discard them. I realize they weren't expensive, but I certainly expected them to last longer than a few weeks."
5,Product is just as advertised,These are delightful. I so enjoy seeing my eight year-old wearing them. They look delicate in the picture but are well-made. They look just like the picture when she wears them.
2,JEWELRY,"These were too small and quickly lost their luster. The detailing was pretty but they were absolutely too small. Maybe they'd work for children but I believe not for adults. Also, the post broke on one of them and the only way to repair was to take to jeweler. Not worth the expense!"
2,Cute but back fell off and lost earing.,"These are super cute, but when my daughter wore them the back fell off and she lost one earing. She is really disappointed."
4,Cute Earrings,"Bought these earrings for my 7 year old granddaughter. They were well made and sturdy; just the right size for small ears. My granddaughter absolutely loved them; so much so, that she put them on immediately after opening the package. You can't go wrong with these."
4,Awesome talent in one little package !,"This is one of the most eclectic cd's I have ever listened to . There is an array of talent, running the gamut from rock, pop and folk- most doing an amazing job. I am a huge fan of duet albums anyway and this one is superb.My favorite track on the album is the one with Patty Griffin, who performs Angel Flying too close to the ground - she has a most unique voice - hard to describe , but once you hear it , you are hooked ! If you have never heard of Patty Griffin( where have you been?:)), this song is a good introduction to her talent .I also love Lonestar with Norah Jones, who is hot right now .Both of the tracks featuring Sheryl Crow shine - actually , I cannot say I did not enjoy every track .If you are a Willie fan , this is well worth the money ."
5,"Not much of a fan, but this is great!","I am not much of a Willie Nelson fan. Classic country isn't my thing - I stick to the new stuff. However, I loved the song Maria Shut Up and Kiss Me and decided to buy the CD. I am so glad I did. The guests sound fantastic and lend a new voice to some of the old songs. There are a huge variety of sounds, voices and music on this disk and even though I'm not into classic country, I can't seem to remove the CD from my car stereo!I'm so glad I took a chance - it's a great compellation!"
1,Absolutely dreadful; not even salacious.,"Why can't Maynard just write a book about something other than herself. she is not special enough or unusual enough (except as an example of narcisssism gone rampant) to write of her own experiences or thoughts or feelings. Maybe she should try to write non-fiction or perhaps take up another type of work. Her writing style if centered about herself totally, the book comes off as vindictive and vengeful. When does she plan to own up to her own predicaments? She does not write well; maybe a talk show would find an audience of her fans."
1,Warning: Avert Your Eyes!,In a word: Awful. Two more words: Tremendous bore. Three more words: Save your money!
1,A very disturbed individual without writing skill,"To her credit, Maynard gets a lot of controvery and literary discussion going. But, in reality, she is a bad writer, self-absorbed and willing to do anything for a buck. Donate the money to charity, instead. She truly has no shame or conscience."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"This book is THE WORST, end of debate. No matter who used who, whose privacy may or may not have been invaded, who was naughty or who was nice -- this book stinks. It could have been written by any mildly precocious high school student, and actually sounds as it it were, now that I think of it. If you buy this book, the joke is on you."
5,Fascinating and well written,"All the Salinger fans who are howling at Joyce for violating his privacy need to get a life. This book is for anyone who succumbed to the charms of an older, sophisticated man who should have known better than to toy with the emotions of a young girl that, I am sure, he never had any interest in growing old with. I do not mean this as a slam on Joyce - she strikes me as a person that a man would be lucky to grow old with. The best part of the book is Salinger's curse on her ""you love the world."" Reminded me so much of my brother in law, who hates the world. What a narrow and bitter life he and JD must lead!!!"
2,Very disappointing,"Perhaps my expectations of this book were too high, but with all the experiences in her life that she had to portray, Joyce Maynard comes up woefully short in holding the reader's interest. Her early passion for J.D. Salinger becomes a seething hatred, with the acclaimed author seeming no more than a curmudgeonly near-pedophile. And, for all the exorcising of her demons and the details of her private life she attempts to share in this book, she is surprisingly light on revelations. I wanted so much more, but found that she used pages to go out of her way not to tell more. It's frustrating, and an ultimately boring read. I was very disappointed."
2,really?,Seldom has the pretense of honesty been used so dishonestly. Her sprinkling of some accurate and revealing observations just leavens her bread of deceit. Future lovers and friends be forewarned (the experienced are already aware).
1,"Tripe, nothing but self-serving tripe","Can I give this one no stars? Yuck! I've followed - not avidly, you understand - Joyce Maynard's writing for years and always thought it rather shallow and self serving. This book proves it. Grow up, Joyce. You've had your fun with J.D. Salinger. You took revenge. Tacky, tacky, tacky..."
2,More of that David Copperfield kind of cr*p.,Depressing. J.D. Salinger pictured as he no doubt really is - a self centered jerk who has inappropriate attractions to younger women. Hard to enjoy his writing after reading this. I do admire her courage in writing this book- I just wish I hadn't read it.
4,"entertaining, well written","Joyce Maynard was one of few women gifted with both talent and opportunity. I ached inside as I watched her set aside her own dreams and aspirations for the needs of others. I wanted to blame J.D. Salinger. I wanted to blame Joyces first husband for being so cold and unavailable. I was hoping for an ending that would allow Joyce to discover her role as a participant, rather than a victim of her circumstances. The book seemed rather unfinished as the reader is left feeling she understands more about the writer than she understands about herself. Joyces memory for detail is phenomenal. I felt as though I was watching a video of her life rather than reading a book. I found this book to say much about myself and my generation of women in general, particularly in the way we often barter our dignity and self esteem for the security of a relationship.Helen Temple"
4,Multifaceted Look at One's Life,"I enjoyed this book on many levels. One, the acknowledgment of ""family secrets"" re: Ms. Maynard's alcoholic father and ""incestous"" mother. Also, Joyce's look into relationships - mainly the one with J.D. Salinger. Perhaps the public is at first interested in her memoir because she tells all re: her affair with the writer. But ultimately, he could have been any person in a position of power for us to witness the abuse of power in relationships. Maynard's book also shows her perseverence in the face of adversity. Her success, both in her career and according the the story her children's success (they seemed unscathed, though we would need to hear from them to know their reality) is a good example of how even with the darkness of life bearing forth, one can still prevail. I do believe her life is worth reading about. She may not be a major hero, but does it matter. She's a woman with her own story. And that's enough."
1,skim it at the bookstore for a snarly laugh at the author,"I felt dirty and soiled by skimming it, but was comforted by the thought that I was in no way giving this loon any royalty money. For real fun, read the last section, in which Maynard presents her controntation with Salinger, trying to paint it in terms of the Abused Girl Speaks at Last...and failing miserably. You cheer Salinger on with every word he speaks."
1,Why in the world should I care?,A poorly written poor-me story. This woman needs to quit reliving her poorly lived past and get cracking on getting herself a real life. A life where she takes full responsibility for everything SHE does and the consequences ensuing. Now that might be worth reading.She better hurry.She also needs to learn to write in a way that doesn't sound flat and zombie like.She should have finished school
1,facile writing; bad book,"Ms Maynard has written a self-serving book -- she attributes her problems to (1) her parents,(2) J. D. Salinger, and (3) her husband. She should have taken some responsibilty and found a good therapist. Her gratuitous name-dropping (e.g., Garry Trudeau)was annoying. And her claim that she was the ""voice of our generation"" - I am a year older than she - seems strange; I had not heard of her before this book, nor had any of my friends from university days."
4,bad press; good book,"Ms. M has every right to write the book she did.though i would not like to be in a relationship with Ms. M, i find her books interesting and educational."
2,The writing is hurried.,"This book reads like the author dashed it off in an evening. It just doesn't seem cohesive or well put together. I found several parts interesting, for instance the first chapters are a very good description of a dysfunctional family. The latter two-thirds of the book just seemed jumbled together with no center."
2,Very Little Bang For The Buck,"My 3 year old daughter has no interest in the activities on the mat (sticking Play-Doh eyes on faceless people, or sticking Play-Doh shapes on blank spots in the pictures). The amount of Play-Doh that comes with this kit is laughable (6 one ounce containers), and the tiny containers are extremely difficult even for an adult to open. Clay comes off the front of the mat easily, but tends to get stuck on the back, and seems to do little to minimize the overall mess of the medium. We received this as a gift, and I'm very glad I didn't spend my own money on it. We love Play-Doh, but there are much better kits. This one was a disappointment."
4,"Leaks some air, but it's not horrible","Not sure why other reviewers are so freaked about the air leaking thing, but it doesn't make the tool unusable by any means. You just have to adjust the angle and the leaking stops, much like a normal air hose attachment. I like it. It's solid, has a bright screen, and does what I need it to do."
1,Junk,Do not buy this gauge. I have to take the back off each time I use it and move the batteries to make contact.
1,Didn't work accurately,"A nice gizmo, but did not read pressure accurately. Don't waste your time with this one. we went back to a manual pressure gauge."
4,Gift for Driver,I purchased this item to be used for someone who is a driver and has to check tire pressure regularly. I do not know how it is working yet.
3,Nice until it broke.,This worked for about a year and then it just died... the part you put on the valve stem broke all up and won't read tire pressures any longer.
5,The Best TP Gauge!,"After I read some comments, I decided to buy it and I also bought this O-Ring that everyone was talking about. When I received my TP Gauge there was already some king of rubber so I didn't have to use that O-Ring. Overall this is simply the best TP Gauge! Recommend to anyone without a doubt!"
3,Nothing to write home about.,"This tire gauge works. It's not that great but it does the job. The plastic case is really weak right between the ""head"" of it and the ""handle"" where the button is. If you keep your thumb on the little spot that's obviously meant for that all is well. If you don't you'll see it flex badly at that spot. I don't expect this gauge to last forever under what I consider normal conditions for a tire gauge.I haven't had any issues making a seal between the tire stem and the gauge as others have reported (don't know why I just haven't).I ordered a ""Accutire MS-4751WC Digital Programmable Tire Gauge with Light"" in the same order and I MUCH prefer it. I know it's more expensive but it's a much better intersection of price vs. quality which in my mind = value. If you are on the fence I'd say order that one."
1,Bad product!,"Once the Accutire MS-4350B arrived I used it to check the pressure in my car tires , it worked only on one tire and I could not get a reading for the remaining tires. The big problem is that next day I got a flat tire and it was the same tire that I was able to get a reading from! The guy at the repair shop told me that this is because the needle at the middle of the valve was moved out of it's correct position which caused the air to leak and ofcourse this is because of the Accutire MS-4350B."
3,Its okay,"I have to agree with the other reviews that say it is not the easiest to put it on a schrader valve and have it stay without letting some air out of the tire. I was extremely frustrated when I was really hot and sweaty after fixing a flat, pumping up the tire to almost 75PSI and losing about 30PSI from trying to check the pressure again.I am learning the best way to use it is with a steady hand. I put the ACCUTIRE gauge nozzle to the schrader valve without pushing to find the right fit and then push the gauge down onto the valve while holding the schrader valve stem of the tire steady."
3,Works well in the summer.,"After looking at all the options out there for digital tire gauges I felt this was the best one. I haven't had any trouble with seating or sealing as some others have mentioned, the gauge works great when it works at all. The problem is mine stops working completely when it gets too cold out, usually just below freezing. I'm not certain if this is true of this model in general or just mine, but once I bring it inside and warm it back up it starts working again. The battery is new. Since the whole point is to keep it in your glovebox to check your tires whenever needed this is a major flaw for a product of this kind. Otherwise it's a nice product, with a well lit and easy to read screen."
5,Very accurate and precise!,"I don't know how many of you remember the definitions of accuracy and precision from high school chemistry, but this product is both! I compared it to two other inaccurate tire gauges and this one was the only consistently accurate gauge after comparing at the dealership. Highly recommended considering its price and durability."
1,Poorly Designed,"This tire gauge is too difficult to use. The gauge must be fitted at the exact angle to the tire valve or no reading appears on the screen, and after three or four tries per tire, you begin to wonder why digital is better than a plain old ""analog"" gauge that's performed adequately for generations, why a programmable gauge is necessary for something as mundane as filling a tire, if a readout to the tenth of a pound is really necessary short of Formula 1 racing, and who paid off Car and Driver Magazine to recommend such an obviously inferior, fragile, and poorly engineered piece of junk."
2,traditional tire gauge,"takes to much time just to check a tire, no good for tight spot, stay with the traditional tire gauge, it cost less too!"
2,it sucks!,first digital tire gauge. this thing is hard to use and even harder to read correctly. i will be switching back to old school tire gauge after this. what a waste of money.
1,It was dead when I needed it,I received the Accutire as a gift and thought it was pretty neat so I threw out my old pencil style gauge which wasn't the most accurate and threw this in the trunk. About 6 months later one of my tires appeared low and when I pulled out the Accutire it was dead. I looked to see if you could replace the batteries but you can't. Once it dies (in about 6 months) you have to buy a totally new gauge. Going back to the pencil gauge which while not the most accurate is guaranteed not to die.
1,knowlege,"the item is attractive, but instructions are lacking.maybe good if one understands how to use it,"
2,Drain battery even you are not using it,"This digital tire gauge drains battery even if you are not using it.I checked my tires once a month, but, I already have to change battery about once per year.The gauge still use power to memoris the pre-setting of tire pressure. come to think about it, thepre-set memory is useless if you have 2 different cars. (Because it only can memoris one front and one back tire setting). The 2032 lithiumX2 battery is not cheap, I expect it should last at least 5 years."
1,"Waste of money, not reliable.","I purchased this gauge from Target, it's marketed by Bell with the Victor branding on it but is the Accutire gauge. I used it once and it was OK (except for the sealing issue which was a slight hassle). I took it from the glove box a few weeks later and it was dead. Although the light still worked I suspected the batteries (isn't it supposed to be auto off)? Changed the batteries and it is still dead. It's a piece of junk. Just buy a manual stick gauge for 5 bucks, they are almost as accurate and at least it will work when you need it."
3,You definitely want an O-ring,"I've had this product for a number of years, and only by reading the reviews here did I learn what was really wrong and how to fix it. In my case, I took an 008 O-ring (width 1/16"", inner diameter 3/16"", outer diameter 5/16""), popped it in, and suddenly decided I liked this tire pressure gauge."
3,Mediocre at best,This Gauge does not make an easy proper seal with the tire valve. The tire loses air with the numberof attempts made to make the seal. I doubted the accuracy of the reading
2,died,"i got 5 of these, to give as presents and to keep one, 4 of them stopped working after a couple of months (under light use... everybody checks the tires once a week.. at most)good idea, bad quality"
1,Not so accurate,"I have 2 accutire ms-4350b.They are consistent but inaccurate.They were both zeroed, and one read 44.0 and the other read 53.5 on the same tire. This was repeatable.Also they will not work if cold at all.About 50 degrees F is required for them to start up."
2,Inconsistent,"It does not make a good seal with the tire stem and sometimes you get a quick and accurate read out, sometimes you have to wait 20-30 seconds until it gives a read out and sometimes, if the seal is not good it gives an inaccurate read out."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"When I pressed the gauge on the schrader valve, it still said zero. No matter how hard I pressed. I think the little pin in the schrader valve was going inside the hole on the pressure gauge."
5,Great gauge for the price,"It's very accurate, assuming 0.5 PSI is close enough for you.I compared the accuracy using a very expensive calibrated gauge."
2,Accutire MS-4350B (broke),"It was ok, while it lasted, but broke after a little over a year, ie. stopped turning on (it's not the battery).It was always difficult to get the seal proper. But it worked well once you had it."
4,Almost perfect digital gauge,"My old ""talking"" digital gauge stopped working after two years and I replaced it with Accutire MS-4350B, which looks and feels pretty solid compare to the old one. I have not had a chance to test its accuracy but otherwise it works well.Pros:1. Establishes a perfect seal 90% of times and almost perfect in the rest 10%2. Auto-on, auto-off. No buttons to press, unless you need to access pre-set values or the light3. Very ergonomic shape (see also a con for this), easy to hold against the valveCons:1. Takes some time to produce a reading (1-2 seconds), while my old gauge was almost instant. The good thing, though, it beeps when the measurement is completed2. The preset memory and the light are not of much use3. Takes more storage space then most other digital gaugesOverall, I would buy it again"
2,"No ""O"" Ring on New Models","I just received three of these gauges this week. They do not have an ""O"" ring in the tip and therefore leak air. Pain in the neck to get a good seal. I have emailed the company requesting that they send me some ""O"" rings. If they don't, they are going back.I'll let you know how this turns out."
2,Difficult to use,Bought this because I wanted the features. Really looking forward to an accurate digital display. I tried it on my car last night and couldn't get it to read on some of the tires. It isn't easy to use. I found myself going back to my plain old tire gauge.
2,Neat features; pitiful quality,"I bought 3 of these a few months ago. One of the three arrived with an internal leak and never worked right. After 3 months, only one of the 3 still works. The second one works only as a flashlight, the pressure reading part has ceased to operate. I can't recommend these to anyone."
2,Difficult to center on the stem,The opening is too wide and I have to very carefully place it on the valve stem just right so it depresses the valve or the valve will slip off to the side of the center pin and not read anything. When I do get it to work it takes too long to read the pressure. The one I got from Walmart for a about $9 works much better and much quicker.
4,seems ok so far,"I bought this after discovering that my older dial gauge was not accurate. From my experience, the cheap pencil style, spring, gauges lose their accuracy by the second time you use them (6 months later). I just dont know how long this gauge will last. I do not know a good way to test the accuracy.Some reviews suggest adding an o-ring or rubber insert to help it seal against the stem. The o-rings I had were too thick, and it looks like it may be difficult to cut some rubber into the right size. I find it seats against the stem about as well as any of the other gauges I have used. You have to hold it exactly parallel, and press hard.It does not have a bleed valve, so if you register more psi than you want, you have to remove the gauge, and bleed off some air then re-test, rebleed.There are better designs, and better products, but probably not at this price."
1,Poor design ruins otherwise good product,"I purchased three of these MS-4350B tire gauges -- one for each of my vehicles. They arrived yesterday. They are going back today. I tried to make an air-tight seal, but regardless of how hard I pushed (and I tried it on each of my vehicles) I could not prevent air from escaping. I see where several other reviewers had some success by purchasing an O-ring, but I feel the manufacturer should make a product that works as advertised without me having to modify it for them."
4,Full value for money,"I bought this gauge around 8 months back and am very pleased with its performance. Its very easy to use and provides the tire pressure in just seconds. I read in other reviews that it does not seal properly while trying to get the pressure. That was true for me initially but as I used it more I got a better understanding of how it should be held so that it seals properly. Now, I am able to get it to seal properly with out any efforts. I am very pleased with the little guy and will definitely recommend it."
1,Absolute rubbish,I am very sorry I bought this tire pressure guage. It worked three times and simply stopped working. Buyer beware this is an absolute piece of rubbish.
2,Looks good but a little hard to use,I found that the gauge doesn't always read correctly the first time you try to get a reading (usually comes up with zero with the tire maybe just a little low. Gauge requires multiple attempts.
3,The O-ring blows it!,"I didn't buy this item from Amazon, I bought it from my local automotive place. But just the same, as some of the others have said, the only real problem with this is the O-ring. It's kind of hard to get a good seal while using this one. It can be frustrating when you're trying to get a good seal, only to find out that when you do get a good seal, that you've lost so much air that you have to do it all over again...as I just did two days ago on both cars and my motorcycle. I finally got to the point where I was just happy to be close and call it a day. The Tirerack ([...]) has what I think might be a better one, but...well, I bought one, and can't find it...which is how I ended up with this one. Needless to say, I'm looking for the one from the Tirerack again.Good luck on whatever you decide, but if I were you...I might go to my local place and try out one of theirs. Provided that they'll even let you demo it."
2,Not well designed..,"I used to have a similar product that I paid about 13 bucks for at Radio shack, that product worked well and w/out any problems.. This Accutire MS-4350B product does work & has a couple of better features, but the main problem is that it takes multiple efforts to secure the mouth of the gauge around the tire nozzle, this sounds like nothing, but believe me, its tedious.. All I really wanted was to check my tire pressure easily, go to radio shack and see if u can get the one I used to have, its much better."
2,It's ok.,"This does exactly what it is supposed to do and that is measure the air pressure of your tires accurately however, whether you use this tool or not, the battery will be drained in about a couple of months as you will have to replace them very, very often!"
2,"New batteries don't reboot it ok, now disabled","Worked great and perfectly for the 1st 9months but when the 2 CR-2032 batteries expired & I replaced them with new ones, the unit never again could turn on again not because the batteries were at fault but because the system goes bezerk when newly ""booted"" up, never ""booting"" up properly. I've put the batteries in then out repeatedly to get it to ""boot"" properly. No luck. Why do they make such a dumb design that can't handle a fresh battery install?"
4,Accurate and leaks no more!,"I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews on here regarding the leaking issue, but like other recent buyers have mentioned, Accutire seems to have caught on and fixed this issue. At least with my 2012 Yaris it seals perfectly and I can take several measurements without even losing 0.5 psi of pressure. The built-in mini flashlight and the backlit LCD display make it really easy to take readings even in complete darkness.After testing at several gas stations, this gauge matched the pumps' readings to within 1 psi, so it is definitely quite accurate. I'm docking 1 star because this gauge has a plastic build but does NOT come with a protective case, which makes me concerned that it may get damaged (especially the LCD screen) if shoved straight into the glove compartment without some sort of protective wrapping. Nonetheless, it does what it's supposed to do, and comes with a few nice features. You will not be disappointed."
1,Far away from accurate,"Bought this gauge but only used once! Since the number is not even close to real tire pressure. My tire pressure was 44, this gauge showed 39..."
4,Easy to Use,"I like it. It's easy to use and there's no guess work involved. Just read the screen, couldn't be easier!"
5,"No ""O"" ring for me.","I just purchased the 4350B after using a friends older model. On all my cars, Mercedes E500, Hyundai Sonata, and Hyundai Elantra I got first try accurate readings with no leakage. I did notice that if I applied too much pressure I could cause it to leak, but pressing just hard enough at the right angle this thing worked like a charm. Although I am highly skilled and extremely dexterous I can't imagine how, with just a little practice, the average person wouldn't achieve the same results."
5,Tire gauge,Bought this for my wife she really loves it. If she needs air it's right there no guess work and easy to use.
2,Not the greatest,"This gauge works okay, when it's working. But the batteries drain too fast and are inconvenient to replace. First, it requires flat camera-type batteries, not readily available AAA or AA batteries. Second, a very small Phillips screwdriver is needed to open the unit to get to the batteries. So right when you need to replace the batteries - say when you're out on the road - you may find yourself without the right batteries or the right screwdriver."
1,Garbage,This thing is a piece of junk. As stated numerous times in other reviews it's almost impossible to get a good seal on the valve without letting a ton of air out. I threw this away and went right back to the old school styled pressure gauge because it works all the time every time.
2,Updated: died (perhaps of the cold),"Update Jan 2011:Well, the darn thing just died sitting in the car, perhaps froze to death. Now all that works is the little flashlight. Maybe it's only the LCD panel that's dead, but obviously it's now useless.I will now look for a decent mechanical gauge.===========================================Earlier review:It does take a little bit of work to align the tip to the tire valve, but I've found that to be true for all tire pressure gauges. (Yes, perhaps a better design is possible, so dock 1 star.)Once you've obtained the right alignment (no prolonged hiss of escaping air), you get a reading quite fast, and it remains consistent from read to read. Note that it shows changes in steps of 0.5 psi.A handy item to keep in your car or garage, slightly easier to use and a bit more consistent than the mechanical ""extending tube"" type of gauge."
1,Short Lived,"My Accutire model MS-4350B tire gauge lived a fairly short life. Purchased in March, 2010 - and used only twice - it was found in a comatose state in early 2012. Attempts at resuscitation proved fruitless and the corpse was laid to rest in a dumpster in my building's garage. Given the 5-year warranty, we considered returning the unit to it's place of birth in Parsippany, New Jersey but the cost of shipping in exchange for a sibling / replacement could not be justified. Even a 50-year or 500-year warranty would not have changed this heart-wrenching decision. MS4350B ... we hardly knew ye. RIP."
1,Total Junk,"Like others have said, poor seal, needs O-ring.But that doesn't matter if the product never works.I bought 2 of these, the first stopped working in a few weeks, the second after about 9 months.Since there's no contact info on the website or in the instructions, the warranty is worthless.This is odd because the other Accutire gauge I had (the original aluminum-cased digital model) worked for 10+ years and I only chucked it because the sealing system was getting munched and I couldn't see any easy way of replacing it. I assumed the company would still be producing a reliable and well-built product but I guess not.At this point it's back to mechanical for me, I suspect things are so cheaply built in this digital era that my experience is going to be the norm."
2,Not pleased at all,"This gauge does not withstand cold weather very well. If you leave it in the car during the winter, it just wouldn't work."
3,Accutire MS-4350B Programmable Digital Tire Gauge,I received the gauge in a timely manner and have only used it once and worked well. I would want to see how this performs over a longer period of time before I could give a more accurate review.
2,"""Monkey-Grip"" version","I have one of these and it's nearly identical to the pictures except that it says ""Monkey-Grip"" on the the handle instead of ""Accutire"". As another reviewer noted it does not work when it is cold. If it's below freezing you need to warm it up first. With the variation that I have the problem isn't that the seal is too loose - it's that the opening for the valve stem is too tight. I have a new Subaru with the tire pressure monitoring system and there is one tire out of the 4 that I cannot take a reading on because I can't get the gauge to slip over the valve stem. On the others it works but just barely."
2,easy come easy go,The light worked about the first 3 mins but it's made in america part of it still works for now. good products are getting harder to find
4,Tire Guage,This item works well and I am satisfied with it. It is a bit difficult to get a good seal though.
1,I should have returned it,This doesn't fit well in my valve stem. I think i've got this for like a year? and so far i've only got a reading from this like twice? Absolutely useless.
1,Grossly Inaccurate,"Bought this item several months ago and have not had an opportunity to use it until a couple of days ago. The reading is grossly inaccurate - roughly 20 psi less than the true tire pressure. Never worked correctly defective out of the box. Would like to return it but hardly worth the effort since at this point I will get a partial refund and will have to pay shipping. I wish I had tried it as soon as I got it so I could have gotten a full refund. With all the other complaints why does Amazon continue to sell this product. I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product, but who would have thought something as simple as a tire air guage could be problemmatic?"
5,Works great,I have no complaints about this tire gauge. I've used it several times now and i haven't experienced any issues with it what so ever. The display works great and it's easy and convenient to use/operate. For the price you can't beat it and i recommend this item to anyone looking for something simple.
3,Plastic construction = short life,"I owned this gauge for a couple of years. My biggest complaint: the shaft inside the sensor nozzle which depresses the tire valve is plastic. Mine just recently snapped off. The gauge is now useless. Also as others have noted, it really is difficult to get a good seal but I got used to it -- I thought it was just me. Who knew it was a poorly designed device? The good: large, well illuminated display. The bad: inferior construction. Still, I got two years out of it and it worked fine while it lasted, hence 3 stars."
3,good tire gauge,"Easy to hold onto and one of the better ones with gloves on in winter. Doesn't always read well on my tire stems, not sure if it is a tire install problem or device problem. I don't use the programmable features at all right now."
4,O-Ring,"I agree with the other reviewers who said this product needs an o-ring. I found it very difficult to get it to seal on the tire valve stem, but with the o-ring it works perfectly. (Why they don't manufacture it that way I don't know). But by getting an inexpensive o-ring from Ace Hardware you have a product that is outstanding. Another reviewer said the size o-ring he bought was 1/4 x 1/8 x 1/16. However I found this size was too small and didn't fit. I had to get 5/16 x 3/16 x 1/16, and it's a perfect fit. And with tax it cost me a mere .18 cents. An easy modification well worth it."
1,I should have listened,"The progammable features are nice, but I should have listened to the other reviews. Those folks that said this gauge doesn't make a good seal with the tire were right on the money. The first time I tried it I let at least 5-6 psi out of the tire. After playing with it for about 20min, I still could only get a good seal after letting about 2-3 seconds of air out of the tire. This thing stinks and I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,One of the better ones out there,"It takes some getting used to in terms of getting the seal to sit right on top. So it isn't dummy-proof. The other reviewers are correct that they could have made the seal better. But once you get the hang of it (the right angle with your valve stem) it is fine. The earlier ones they made were pretty good too. But this is excelletn for the price. My only quibble is that it is a bit bulky. In this day and age, they could reduce the size a bit. And if you have an O-ring that fits, all the better."
2,not very easy to use,i tried out this digital tire gauge and did like it at all. the nozzle doesnt cover the tire stem very well and as a result a lot of air leaks out while you are trying to read the tire pressure.
1,Do not recommend,"the blue screen is cool, that's it the stem does not properly sit causing air to leak, I do not recommend at all."
5,No air leakage problem,"I just received this tire gauge and it works very well. They may have fixed any air leakage issues with this latest batch. If I have any issues in the future, at least I know I can get a cheap o-ring as referenced in the other review.I really like the design and feel of this tire gauge. It is very natural to push in and place your thumb on the specified spot.I also like the blue backlight. It makes it very easy to read to the large numbers. I don't really mind that it only displays by 0.5 PSI increments. Let's be real, who really needs it any more accurate than that?I can't vouch for how long the battery lasts since I just got this unit but maybe I will go back and update this review once I have to replace the batteries."
4,like it,I like it just make sure you don't leave it out in the cold in the car. I was going to use it one day and forgot it was in the car. When I went to turn it on the LCD was frozen I had to let it thaw inside the house. After that it was a great little tool.
4,takes some getting used to,"this is a very different kind of tire gauge. once you get used to using it, it works really great and gives a nice and visible read out of what your pressure is. I read somewhere that it can get loose when measuring the pressure and they said to use a little electrical tape which we did and that helped alot.good buy, especially for people that can't see too good since it is very easy to read and see."
4,Good purchase,Easy to use and the screen is easy to read. It's a little big for a tire gauge but the size also makes it easier to handle.
5,Excellent tire gauge,"I bought two of these gauges. They are easy to use and work great. They appear to be accurate, unless they are both off exactly the same way. By keeping my Toyota Prius tires properly inflated I get at least 10% better gas mileage, so the gauges will pay for themselves soon."
1,I got a peice of junk,"Not much to say here. After using this about 10 times, it stoped working. The digital screen just showed strange symbols, even after I changed the battery."
1,Don't buy,"Bought this a year ago. Worked ok. Three months later, used it again. Again it worked as advertised. I'm absolutely positive I turned it off. Tried to use it yesterday. Batteries dead. I'm estimating it has been turned on a total of 45 minutes. I believe that turning it ""off"" does not entirely do so. The batteries are probably always maintaining internal settings and thus always draining. Not worth the money."
2,Looks good but.....,This looks fine. Easy to use and all that. But it took a lick soon after I bought it and I just pitched it and went back to the old faithful rod type gauge. The light still worked so I think it more than just a battery.
3,buying the unnecessary tire gauge,"I purchased the tire gauge at the recommendation of Amazon.com.....folks who purchased this (the air pump I purchased) also purchased this.I suppose the gauge works OK. It's a bit overpriced for what it does but, in this case, I got what I paid for."
1,Unreliable,"Complete garbage. Bought it a year ago when my low tire pressure light came on. Threw it in the glove compartment and forgot about it. My tire pressure light came on this morning and the gauge is dead. I don't know if its a dead battery or if the device died. I don't really care. If you plan on using this rarely it is not reliable. Good luck finding any information about their ""manufacturer warranty""."
2,Terrible tire gauge,"Look elsewhere. As other reviewers have noted, the seal on the product is insufficient, so trying to get an accurate reading without losing pressure from bleed off is a challenge not worth engaging, especially when there are better gauges out there."
3,"Good readings, SLOW readings","This item looks good and functions well (from what I can tell). The bad thing is you have to hold it in place for too long to suit me. I can use a manual reader and take the average of three readings in the amount of time this thing takes one. I guess maybe I'm just more or less good at this sort of thing, but I was not impressed."
5,Great tool,"This is very good tire pressure gauge. I bought one many years ago and use it. When it's been left unused for longer than year (not sure how long, maybe 2 - 3 years) battery died and after replacing it I couldn't make it work. Now I have new tire gauge and sure it will work as well as the old one."
5,What a Great Tool!,"I was a little nervous about purchasing this gauge because some of the reviewers complained about it being hard to get a reading. Well, I have had no trouble whatsoever using this great little tool. The worst problem I've had is that every now and then I have to redo the reading because I didn't get a complete seal the first time, but I did not lose any significant air and it was no big deal doing it a second time. I'm not good with tools at all and get really impatient fairly easily, so if I am not having problems using this gauge, it's probably because the gauge is actually that easy to use!"
1,doesn't work,gauge does not work at all. Cost and time involved to return is more than the original cost. Such is one of the shortcomings of buying online.
1,defective,I received a defective product. The LED lamp would not turn on. Thank God I bought it through Amazon.com and was able to return the product and get a refund.
1,Total Piece of Junk - Do Not Buy This One,"Real piece of junk. Had it in my van and was attempting to use it this past weekend at the track (big mistake) was eventually proven to be as high as 5psi off in accuracy. After rechecking against 2 other real and proper track side guages I was shocked to see how far off this guage was in terms of accuracy, especially within its own normal operating range/pressures.*This thing is actually so far off as to be considered dangerous in my opinion- Do Not Buy or use. Mine went straight in the garbage once I realize how bad iot was made. This people should be sued."
3,"Good idea, poor product","I was aware from other reviews I would have to add an ""o"" ring to get a tight seal for chedking prssure but I didn't realize it would not do what I bought it for....it won't check my motor home tires. Not configured for the tight spaces these tires require...and I haven't bought the ""O"" ring yet so find the tool useless even on my car tires. I hope the ""O"" ring will solve the problem or it will be going back to Amazon."
5,Nice,"Me gustó el producto por que al utilizar los medidores de presión normales se pierde la exactitud, con este no sucede, mantiene la exactitud.Lo recomiendo."
1,Not a happy time,"I sent off for the tire gauge on Amazon at the end of November, 2009. It came reasonably promptly, but when I fired it up, the little light which is used to illuminate the valve stem did not work. After debating whether I should return it because the gauge itself seemed to work OK, I sent it back about December 15. It has NEVER ARRIVED. How can one be happy if it NEVER ARRIVED? I attempted to share this information with Amazon but was never contacted by Amazon with respect to my inquiry. How can I work it out if Amazon NEVER CONTACTS ME???????Accutire MS-4350B Programmable Digital Tire Gauge"
2,Se daña fácil,"Compré un producto de estos hace pocos meses y se dañó de una vez, en menos de tres meses no funcionaba a pesar del poco uso que le di. No lo recomiendo."
5,tire gauge,"If you're looking for a nice tire gauge, then this one is definitely a winner. Believe me when I say I do research b4 I buy anything, and the research on this product paid off. If you're in the market, then stop here because you need not look any further."
4,wonderful product,I love this tire gauge. I love that it is digital. It takes the guessing out of getting air in your tires.
5,sbr,I love this product it is very accurate and it has allowed me so save lots of money in tyres and at the fuel pump
4,Very good item,"I bought this for my wife, it works well and allows her to check the car tires if needed. She now feels more safe when driving."
5,good product,I bought 3 of these to place one in each car. it is easy to use and accurate as far as I can tell. Easy to read. Haven't had for a long time but assume they will hold up as far as battery life..
4,Nice gauge,Works well I like the little light ithelp if you need to deel with tirepressures at night.
1,good if your tire is in the living room,"I received the Accutire as a gift and it worked really well when I first tried it and I stowed it in my center console. When I tried to use it for the first time for real it refused to work. It was all but dead, the cute little lite worked but I was more interested in checking my tire pressure then lighting up the afternoon sky. When I brought it into the house it came back to life. My guess is that it does not like to work in the cold. There is something to be said for the tried and true manual tire gauge."
1,Junk with fatal design flaw,"It is extremely difficult to make a sealed, air tight connection between gauge and tire stem. What's worse is that when it beeps (to tell you that you have a good reading) if you don't immediately remove it, I mean a flash fast muscle twitch reaction, it resets itself and erases the reading it just took.Since I was wrestling with making the connection, my hands, the gauge and the air stem were in constant motion. I had no way to remove the gauge right at the precise beep moment.Since it costs 75 cents for 3 mins of air at most gas stations around here, I spent $1.50 just to top off the the inflation levels...and I wanted a hammer to beat the gauge into the asphalt.I've thrown it away.P.S. Some have mentioned O rings and the ""new"" version but I bought mine in October '08. It was anything but new and improved. Finding and installing an O ring for this gadget is way beyond my pay grade. If you think you can do it, it's probably a great little gizmo."
4,Good product,I'm not interested in bells and whistles - just accuracy. This gauge seems to be accurate although I'm counting a lot on its specs. It works nicely if you push it on the stem straight. I do wish the buttons were better protected from accidental pressing. Mine goes in the saddlebag of my Goldwing so I fashioned a protective sheath for it from the blister pack it came in.
4,Nice to check tire pressure,"I am pleased with my new pressure guage. The lighted display and the LED light help to get the reading in dim light. I have had little or no problem getting a ""seal"" to measure tire pressure. Very pleased."
3,Don't really care for it,"It is hard to keep on the stem for an accurate reading. Some reviewers have said it needs an O ring, so the manufacturer should have installed it."
4,Works,Thought the product worked ok. Loss of air though due to bad contact as the other reviews said.
4,well design product,Nice flesh light funtion at the tip. Easy to use for auto but hard to reach for motorcycles.
1,Great while it last!,This product is very easy to use and the readings appear to be very accurate. However after only 10 months it started giving erroneous readings. Changing the batteries did not help so I'm stuck with a very expensive led light. I would not recommend this tire pressure gauge.
4,Great dark atmosferic metal from the USA,Primordial is a band from the USA but sounds like a very great european band. I think that's the reason the band have signed on the fantastic misanthropy label from England(also In the woods and Beyond dawn) Listen to primordial is great music and lyrics
5,Great Resource!,This is a great guide for staying healthy AND maintaining or losing weight. I found it especially helpful since I am a vegetarian and often have trouble getting enough protein.
4,Helpful and Easy to Use Food Composition Guide,"Are You Eating Right is a helpful and informative way to analyze your diet. As a general guide to food composition, it provides the basic information we need in order to know what we're actually eating as well as to plan how to get the nutrients we need in our diets. It's clear and easy to use; I highly recommend it."
5,Powercord for Ac Adapter ( Toshiba ),Everything was perfect and came in the mail even before it was due. I was scared that this cord adapter would not work but everything was good.
1,Dont Bother,"I love forensic books, Patricia Cornwell in particular, when I saw that she had given this book the thumbs up, I figured it was worth a read. I, like many of the other reviewers found that this book SUCKED! This book could have been about 100 pages smaller if the author quit bragging about all the techniques HIS school teaches. Nobody likes a braggart! He kept comparing ""real life"" CSI to the CSI show, most of us are fully aware that the CSI with Grisom is just a show and that most CSI labs dont have all that expensive equipment. My recommendation is to not waste your time with this book."
3,From an entertainment poit of view,"From an entertainment point of view, I found it to be interesting and a quick read. The chapters are short, so it's good if you are the sort of person that doesn't have a lot of time to devote to reading.'Beyondy the Body Farm' and 'Deaths Acre' by Dr. Bill Bass & Jon Jefferson would be, in my opinion, a better, more informative read.Beyond the Body Farm: A Legendary Bone Detective Explores Murders, Mysteries, and the Revolution in Forensic ScienceDeath's Acre: Inside the Legendary Forensic Lab the Body Farm Where the Dead Do Tell Tales"
5,I Felt Like a Kid Again!,"I found myself thinking that this came from the author's own background, because it seemed very real to me. I could sense that he had had some of these experiences himself. I thought it was well plotted, and I thought the characters were engaging. I felt drawn into the mystery. You don't *have* to be a kid to enjoy this nostalgic trip back to the 50's."
4,"""Nightwing storms through eternity""","Music: Probably the fastest music known to man. It has very fast guitars and drums. Vocals: Growling, screaming and dark voices. Lyrics: Long and variety. Quotation from song #9: ""Dracul would show the world how to correct, the Rumanians which lacked strength or showed disrespect. The following story is just one of many on Draculs way, to out wipe every opposer who didn't him blindly obey."" Instruments: Guitars, bass and drums. Themes: The Dracul clan, Satanism and anti christianity.I give it 4 stars because of a good album with blasting speed and well-written lyrics. Total time: 47 min."
3,Ok Black Album..,"This isn't quite bad black metal album, but it doesn't have that 'something' for me. Dunno what, but I prefer more other bands, like Dark Funeral, Dimmu Borgir etc.."
5,A Terrific Resource With As Much or As Little Information as You Need!,"As someone who writes grants on a regular basis, I found Waddy Thompson's book to be both a great refresher of the basics, as well as a deep resource for the more detailed information that a professional grantswriter uses regularly. The CD-ROM also has some great templates and research guides for the first-time grantswriter starting from scratch. The layout of the book allows for easy ""flipping through"" to glean as much or as little info as you need, and for easy review. Clean, light writing that gets to the point; overall, a terrific resource for anyone writing for themselves or an organization who is entering the sometimes tricky world of grants."
3,not what I was expecting,"The items arrived in time and without any damage. Overall the unit is ok with one major issue. The unit won't stop running unless I set it to the lowest humidity setting. I have another product (different brand) which works great, stops when humidity level is reached, so there is something in the humidity detection/sensor of this product that doesn't work as expected."
5,I believe this is a good room air hudmidifier,"We previously had a honeywell cold air humidifier we liked, but the fan wore out. When I looked at the reviews for another one just like it, they all had issues with the fan. So, I started looking for another one. If you put the fan on high on this one it is rather noisy. So for the night time, I just turn it down to low. It really puts the moisture in the air. I am happy with it."
4,Honeywell HCM-6009 QuietCare Humidifier,"This thing really pumps humidity into the air! If I don't turn it way down it would send 10 gallons water into my house easily. My home is 2300 sq. ft. It will get a little noisy when it is just about empty due to vibration of the reservoirs being light. I throw a phone book on it after refilling and that does the trick. I am happy with my decision to purchase this item. It's compact, well made, nice looking and it WORKS! My only wish is that it held more water, but I'm lazy and it is easy to refill. I haven't had to clean (de-lime) it yet, but I figure it can be easily done in a bucket with vinegar or ""whatever"" solution."
4,Happy that I bought this...,I live in a 2 Bedroom apartment. Have been using this for a month now and I am happy with it so far. No issues whatsoever. I keep this big boy in my living room. So I barely hear any noise from this.
2,Not so good,The unit is noisy no matter where you place it. The output that it is rated for (9 gallon) does not even approach that. The filter deteriorated within a month and was yearning for a new one and at $24.00 a filter this is really not very eccoomical. I t is hard pressed to raise the humidity above 35% and stays aound 25 % mostly.The filter does not absorb water from the well and have to flip filter a couple times a day to keep any moisture in it.Overall Honeywel (who used to sell great products) sold me a bummerTwo stars tops but probably should be one.
2,Not much humidity,1.) Does not raise my house no more than 2% in humidity.2.) Kind of a pain to refill.3.) Noisy operation.4.) I see no benefit from this product.5.) Saw new one on Wal-Mart's website for $10 cheaper than the used one I bought.
3,LOUD!!!!,"This unit is attractive and compact. It controls humidity very well. We love it for that reason, but had to mark it just ""OK"" because it is SO LOUD! As of yet we have found no way to deaden the vibrating noise."
4,Works well,The humidifier works well. We had some mineral accumulation on the filter that came with the unit. I am hopeful that we can remove it.
5,Great Unit.,"Used this unit for the first time over the Christmas holidays at my vacation home in Vermont. Works great. No more nosebleeds, cracked hand asthma attacks and dry lips. I ran it on low fan and max humidity setting so it was quiet and really improved the comfort level in my approximately 1500 square foot home. I would fill up both tanks in the kitchen sink first thing in the morning and then after dinner in the evening. Well worth the $90."
1,MOLDY SMELL IN 3 SHORT DAYS,"I am highly allergic to mold. Following all directions and the mold proof thingy made this to the garage in 3 days. Smelled up the whole house with a dirty moldy rag smell. Too sick to return it, just wasted money."
1,Garbage!,"Cheap piece of c*** put together you know where. Noisy as can be, even on the lowest setting. The term QuietCare is a joke on the consumer. I do have to say that it does a good job putting water into the air.NEVER AGAIN!"
1,STAY AWAY,More KAZ junk. Not made by Honeywell. KAZ has the worst customer service anywhere and the products do not last. Save yourself the aggravation by never buying a KAZ product! You've been warned.
1,"FALLS APART WITH USE, NOT EVEN HONEYWELL- MADE BY ""KAZ""","First off this is NOT a honeywell product, it is made by a firm called ""Kaz"" whose number is 8004770457 and has a horrible automated answering system that makes for a very effective deterrent to calling in and actually dealing with a problem.Tanks start leaking after just a few weeks of use. Long enough for the return window to expire. They do NOT provide warranty support. They don't even seem to pick up the phones. Their phone system was kind enough to inform me that their office hours are 9-5 M-F and then send me back to the beginning of its menu options at 11 AM on a Friday.Avoid at all costs."
1,Honeywell Quietcare??? humidifier,"I am sure that this product humidifies the air but at what cost? At top fan speed it is as noisy as a car engine; at low fan speed it makes more noise than a vacuum cleaner. Sleep with this on? Impossible!!! Honeywell says it is 30% quieter... than what? A dishwasher? I am now forced to buy an ultrasonic humidifier, and use this only when not at home. They call it Quietcare. Give us a break!!!"
2,Won't stay running,"I've had this about two weeks. The first week it was fine - so of course i threw out the box it came in. Now it won't stay running. The connection between the cord and the unit itself is temperamental. I have to fiddle, wiggle and play to get it going again and then it will just shut itself off at any given time (on the highest setting so it's not the humidistat causing it to shut off). Trying to work my way through it but if not, i've then got to figure out how to send something this big back.To be fair, when it runs, it does what it should. The highest fan setting is pretty loud but the second highest is plenty tolerable."
2,"Works Well, but a pain in the #&@%*","No question that this product puts out plenty of moisture, but the aggrevation of filling those two containers that won't sit flat in the sink isn't worth it. Add an anti-bacteria fluid to the water too, because the cartridge they give you doesn't appear to work and the filter (really a wick) gets dirty and scaled up pretty fast. My old Bemis worked as well, didn't make any more noise, and was a lot more convenient."
4,Hurrah for Honeywell Humidifier!,"The Honeywell Humidifier (HCM-6009) arrived from Amazon within 24 hours!Wonderful as that was, however, the performance of this humidifier is superior. I have used humidifiers for many years, because of a touch of emphysema in one lung. Most of what I have used in the past required several fillings per day and often did not last the night. The large capacity of this is such that I have been prepared to re-fill it when it was still half full. Even more important, however, is the efficiency in keeping the room at about 50% humidity. I have no serious complaint; and much to praise.Perren"
1,Works Great-----UPDATE-- not so good,"I have a 1700sf home, and it humidifies the whole house on low!! I have to shut it down every other day as the moisture collects in the window frames. Best humidier ever owned!WORKED GREAT AT FIRST- Now the filter keeps drying up and it runs without working even though there is water in it....."
3,Mistaken Identity,"When I bought this Humidifier, it was advertised as a nine gallon unit, leading me to believe that it would have a tank capacity of nine gallon. I was quite surprised upon receiving it to discover that the capacity of the dual tanks together was only three gallons. I complained to Amazon about the deception, which I am sure was unintentional, and the wording has been changed to ""nine gallon output."" This is better, but it still could lead one to think the tank capacity is nine gallon.This unit does function well and lives up to it's claim as far as the output is concerned. It is probably as quiet as you could expect any three speed fan to operate. My other complaint is about the difficulty of use. The twin tanks are hard to fill, because the aesthetic design of a rounded top doesn't sit flat when they are in the filling position, which makes that operation somewhat of a wrestling match.Having said all that, the Honeywell HCM-6009 is a good product and worth the purchase."
1,Water tanks broke.,Both water tanks broke. First one cracked when it fell to the floor while empty. The the second one broke when the handle came off while carrying a tank full of water. The tanks are make of too brittle plastic and not durable.
1,LASTED 3 MONTHS,"I bought this in October of last year and it died the end of December. Upon calling customer service i was given a RMA number, but when i found out it would cost me $50 to ship it back to them i decided it was not worth the hassle."
3,"Great product, horrible customer service","Excellent air-cleaning humidifier with large capacity. However, after 2 weeks one of the water tanks developed a hairline crack and started to leak. The so-called customer service agent at KAZ (the manufacturer) was rude and condescending, first telling me that I had to contact Amazon, then telling me that the tank was not covered by the 3-year warranty and would cost $20- plus shipping and tax to replace. 5 stars for the product, no stars for customer care. Buyer beware."
1,Waste of Time,"It ran perfect for one day then started buzzing, then started making a scraping noise, so replaced it with identical one, out of the box, the replacement, you could tell the fan was out of balance but it still ran quite for one day then the buzzing started and got progressively worse until I could not stand it, about a week, and I returned it for a refund."
1,Tank Cracked.,We've been using this humidifier for two months. I've been pretty pleased with it. It's not too loud (but not exactly quiet either). And it keeps our small apartment at a very comfortable level of humidity.But I'm disappointed with the humidifier because as I was filling the tanks last night one of the tanks tipped over and cracked. It was no where near hard enough of an impact for something to break. Ridiculous actually. I just put in a complaint with Honeywell. We'll see what happens.Another negative is it is pretty ugly too!
1,Piss Poor Packaging of Contents,ordered the product on Thurday March 8th 2012 got it on Saturday March 10th 2012 was very happy that it arrived with the two day shipping only problem is its missing the part that make it work the wick filters. Both are missing so I call Honeywell they were very helpful is sending out a replacement to the tune of 7 to 10 business days. So much for the 2 day ship from amazon. Kinda backfired on getting the second day ship if its going to be another 2 weeks before I ca use it.
2,Not Quiet I bought from Amazon,"This unit is not quiet. It is noisy, loud at night - very annoying. It does not give any indication of humidity level.the unit is easy to refill.It does have three levels of noise - low, medium and high.Compared to other humidifiers I have used this one is not efficient. I base this on the amount of water it uses. I live in the desert and my prior one put 9 gallons a day into the air...this one goes a couple days or more before I can refill it.Sign me very disappoint in Honeywell.......live and learnI bought at Amazon a couple months ago and and price is lower.....now...tells you something."
4,Honeyqwll HCM-6009,Nice piece of equipment. It needs to be attended to to make sure everything is lined up before it runs.
2,Only lasted one season,"This product performed adequately for one season. When we attempted to use it at the beginning of the second season, we discovered the motor unit was no longer working. In view of the price of the unit, it should have a useful life in excess of six months."
5,Works well,"I bought two for my 4700 ft2 house in AZ. They are quiet and able to keep the house at 35 - 40% humidity. Downside is that I must refill the water tanks daily for my low humidity situation. Honeywell is a brand leader for humidifiers, and I would recommend for purchase."
4,Honeywell HCM-6009 Humidifier,"When we found that we needed to keep our Arizona home above 50% humid, I did some research on line to find the best product. The Honeywell HCM-6009 seemed to be the best fit within our price range so we ordered a unit from Amazon.The day it arrived I unpacked it, filled it and plugged it in. It has been constantly in service since that time. Within a few hours at the beginning it got our house above the 50% humidity mark and I had to back it down a little until the right humidity stabilized. It is a very quiet unit and has a good water supply when both tanks are filled. It generally lasts over 24 hours before a refill is needed.I am very satisfied with the quality and efficiency of this humidifier.Roger Hart"
4,"Does the job, but capacity is limited.",Have to refill it about two times a day during the winter months. The red light is perpetually on. Have to figure out why as it appears to be working well.
4,Very effective,Bought this unit when I put in a wood stove to heat my house. Works great tho a little on the loud side. Wood heat is very dry and It really does a very nice job of humitifying me entire house.
2,Works but not easy to use,"Not too long after getting this humidifier, I found it was awful to fill.The water compartment is rounded and does not sit well when filling.The plastic used is very this so because this, I've cracked it twice.The last time rendering it impossible to hold water.I would not reccomend this machine and will now goback to the Hunter Douglas models."
5,Great product,Provides our 1500 sq foot home with good humidity w/ a wood stove being our primary source of heat. It's easy to clean. The product is exactly what I expected it to be based on the other reviews and the manufacturers specification.
1,CHEAP plastic- did not last 3 months,Well the return window expired so I'm stuck with this overpriced piece of junk. Both tanks have cracked- it flooded my floor causing hundreds of dollars of damage and when it did work was so loud that you couldn't hear much else. Please since I've already wasted my money take this review and buy something else- the plastic is so cheap. I thought since the price was higher and it was a Honeywell product I could expect more- this is the worst purchase ever. Bought it on 10/31/12 and not even 3 months later and it is going in the garbage - disappointing and my last purchase of this brand.
2,Similar noise to that of a blast furnace,"Although I'm nor the fore most expert on humidifier, this one wasn't for us. It does output a ton of humidity however that is about all that I'm happy with. It is a fan based unit so it has a large filter and a fan. When the fan is on high it's very loud. You can feel the air coming out at a great speed but the frustrating part was the noise. I had to put it almost on the other side of our upstairs to make it bearable. Also its a higher pitched fan because of the size. I would no recommend this unless you had no other choice. That being said, I don't know of many units that can match the output and also hold enough water to go almost 24 hours without being refilled."
3,Good product IF you don't have to buy parts,"After dealing with their parts supplier four times[Kaz Inc] I will NEVER buy another Honeywell product again...They send the wrong parts,10-14 work days for delivery,poor communication & they didn't pass it on that a part is backordered...Customer Service is poor!"
4,good product,"works well, quiet compared to other models.no odor problems as others have stated, just follow directions, not much work keeping it clean and running well"
4,Good Value vs Performance,"Overall a winner in high output humidifier. At $80, its a good buy.3 fan speeds, at low speed-its quiet enough for sleeping, at medium speed-its good for daytime use, when you still want to watch TV or listening to music, chatting with friends, at high-speed, select this when you are not in the house....Would recommend this product to other looking for high output humidifier."
5,This machines stopped my daughter's nose bleeds,"We live in the Mojave desert and my daughter was getting nose bleeds almost every night. We put this in her room and she has gone two weeks without one...which is the longest stretch since we moved from California to the Mojave desert. Great machine, great value. For $90 this is far better than the humidifier we bought at the drug store for cold virus treatment."
4,"Very good humidifier, not the longest run time","The unit works well and seems sturdy enough. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because of two, relatively minor, gripes:1. The run time on the highest settings is less than 24 hours. To my mind, one of the conveniences I look for in a humidifier is having water tanks that are sufficiently large to avoid daily filling. For a unit this big, the tanks don't hold enough to last a full day on the max settings.2. The following complaint is, I admit, so small I'm almost embarrassed to list it: The handle on the top of each water tank makes it impossible to walk away from the tank while it's in the sink filling with tap water. If you don't stand there and manually hold it upright, the tank will simply fall over. It's not a reason to avoid this product, but it would have been a nice feature."
3,bit to loud,"All in all very good product, the only down fall is a little bit to loud for night time sleeping"
1,I returned this item,"I really like the fact that this humidifier has such a large reservoir, but the portion of the humidifier that houses the motor vibrated against the portion of the humidifier that holds the water. The noise was annoying to me. I tried reseating both the motor housing and the water reservoir, but this did not resolve the noise, so I returned this item. Maybe I just got a lemon as this product has a lot of positive reviews."
2,More like an evaporative cooler,"We heat with a wood stove, and need to add moisture to our dry house. This is like having an evaporative cooler blowing inside the house - the air becomes very cool when it passes through this thing. Nobody wants to be near it, or have it in their room. And it is loud, unless you use the lowest setting, then it tends to hum. We are not really satisfied with this thing. It's going back.I would not recommend this this if you have to be anywhere near it."
3,Effective - but can be noisy,"First, the good - this is a very effective humidifier. Keeps humidity at 48 to 52% in our 2000 square foot house - something our furnace mount units have been unable to do in freezing weather.All evaporative type humidifier with fans have fan noise. There can be a humming noise in addition to the expected sound of the fan from this unit. The hum seems to be due to vibration of the parts particularly the water tanks against each other. We found the same thing with the original unit we received and returned, and with the replacement unit. We also found that we can minimize and almost eliminate the hum by adjusting the position of the water tanks in the base - or simply letting the unit run on high for a while (notable fan sound on high) which seems to allow the tanks to ""settle"" into a position where there is minimal hum.Does a good job - yes, we need to fill the tanks twice a day in cold weather but that's expected as the unit is effectively adding moisture to the air."
5,Very effective for the $$$$,"This is a very cost-effective way to add significant moisture to a relatively large area. It seems to actually use 9 gal per day so it must be refilled daily, but at very little trouble. I'll probably buy another for another floor in my home. No itchy-scratchys this winter."
5,Works very well,"Apparently our house was very dry, we go through all 9 gallons every day! Initially it sounds loud, but I hardly hear it now!"
4,Good Humidifier,"Overall, I like this humidifier. It is able to humidify up to 2300 square feet, but our place is much smaller. It is a quiet unit and is easy to fill. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the design is a bit bulky."
4,A little Awkward,"It works fine but is a little awkward to fill the containers -- the containers are difficult to fill, as they tend to tip easily while filling. I also have a Holmes humidifier which is much easier to deal with. They do not sell that humidifier anymore so went with the Honeywell."
2,Very Loud!,Received the product and set it up as instructed however I was disappointed of how loud it is. It doesn't matter the setting (Low or High) it makes the same loud humming. I took it a part to pin point the culprit and found that the humming comes from the vibration of the plastic enclosure. So far I haven't been able to find an optimal solution to minimize the vibration. Very disappointed with it.
2,Too fragile,"While it really does humidify the room, one of the water tanks cracked after I'd only had it three days, the plastic so fragile that it broke as I lifted it out of the bathtub where I'd filled it. Remains to be seen if this company will do the right thing and supply a free replacement tank."
3,works well.,"This unit works well,but it rattles like crazy and I spen alot of time trying to get it to stop..other than that its a good unit...maybe thay will put some pads on it or do something to stop the noise..??"
2,i don't like it,very noisy - not so much from the fan but from the ill fitting plastic components vibrating and rubbing together. very irritating. filling the tanks is awkward.
3,"Okay, but ....","While I love the humidifier and it is a ""whole house"" (I have a 1700 sq ft ranch), it is really ackward to fill. First off, the cap is really wide and I have a small hand. I had to go out and buy a rubber square ""gizzy"" to aid in unscrewing the cap. Additionally, when you turn the plastic container upside down to refill, because of the handle it does not sit level on the ground, floor, tub or whatever you use. You have to prop it with the cap so it sits level. It definitely needs some improvement. Would I recommend? Yes, with hesitations ....."
1,sorry i bought it,It is so noisy i can hear it run up stairs. putting water in it it is very hard to do also. I will never buy this product again.
1,Extremely LOUD!,I don't understand why it's called QuietCare when in fact it is so loud that in a downstairs location I can hear it running in an upstairs bedroom with a TV on. Forget it if you think your going to place this anywhere near your bed. It sounds like a huge old box fan running. If it were not for the horrible loud noise I would have kept it. I am returning to amazon and will keep looking for a quiet humidifier.
2,Water tank design poor!,"The humidifier works well. However, the water tanks design is frustrating. The tanks will not set on a flat surface when turned upside down for refilling. You have to hold them steady as the water runs in, getting heavier and heavier. One of my tanks flopped over and sprang a leak at the seam between the clear and opaque halves. I fixed it with epoxy and glue, but it flopped again and broke the seal a couple of weeks later. I think this will happen to most tanks eventually. Honeywell should have provided a jig or stand to set the tanks in while filling, or better yet, have tanks that will set flat."
3,Broken...but,"One of the water tanks came broken. I fixed it myself with a little epoxy. The fan shuts off when it runs out of water, which i think is a dumb idea. Otherwise, seems to work as advertised."
1,High defect rate,I first ordered HCM-6009 on Amazon and it did not work so I returned it and reordered HCM-6011i on Amazon again. I should not have ordered it again because the HCM-6011i I got did not work either.
4,Honeywell Humidifier,"Product does a very good job and is relatively quiet. I usually have to fill the two chambers 1-2 times daily to keep my main floor comfortable. The only thing I don't like about it is that it did not come with a humidity guage and has never shut off on its own when the house was humid enough, so I pretty much just keep it running on low with mod humidity all the time."
2,The filters are expensive!,"The machine works great but after three weeks we started smelling something that smelled like a wet dog. The filter was dark yellow and the customer service agent told us that this is mineral buildup from our water. He said that we ""unfortunately have to change the filter every month"" and that there is no way to clean the filter. These filters are $25 each! He apologized for the expense but said that there is no way around this. We had no idea that this was going to be an ongoing expense like this when we bought this model. I suggested that he put this information on the box so that a person buying this model will understand the ongoing expense associated with using it. It does keep our whole house at a good humidity and its relatively quiet. We really like it otherwise, just a bit sticker-shocked at the fact that we have to stock up on these expensive filters."
5,Nice humidifier,This humidifier works great. Keeps the humidity up in the winter even with our wood insert running all the time. Nice and quiet running also.
2,not sure Wat to say,Haven't had itore than a month and have to replace the filter tanks can be difficult to open and fill wish they would have made tank so they sat flat while filling not bad unit wouldn't buy another
4,Humidifies Quickly!,"This humidifier does the job it is supposed to do - gets humidity in the air quickly.PROS:Large water capacity - lasts 24 hours without refillPortability, wheels make the unit easy to move between roomsDifferent humidity and fan levels according to your needsNo white dust or visible mistQuickly raises humidity level in a roomShuts off when tanks are emptyCONS:Not a digital model, the instruction booklet that comes with it is for a digital model.Tanks are a bit awkward but can be filled easily at a kitchen sink with a spray hose.Too noisy on level 2 and 3 to use while sleeping. Level 1 is very quiet though.OVERALL:If you need portability, a larger tank capacity and a way to quickly humidify rooms, this is a good product. I haven't found a better one yet for those purposes."
5,Takes the shock out!,"I purchased this in 2009 for our construction office, located in the desert of California, where the humidity is almost 0% in the fall and winter. Our office staff was constantly being shocked, and our computer technician said that the low humidity was adversely affecting our server and other computers. This humidifier has drastically improved the humidity level; currently it's at 35%, which is very pleasant. We use tap water, and have had no problems. The unit also turns itself off when the water is depleted, so we have peace of mind that it will not overheat. I highly recommend this unit!"
4,Picture misrepresents the color,"Since this product has been so thoroughly reviewed I have only one thing to say: It's not gray or silver as the picture portrays. IT'S WHITE! I kept it because I didn't want to wait for another order to ship but white seems so institutional, like it should be in the infirmary of a nursing home. I asked if I could spray paint it but Honeywell said that that would probably void my waranty, so white it is. They also said that the picture does look gray/silver but that white is the only ""color""."
4,Quiet Large Humidifier,"This is a massive humidifier. Quiet and is in the bedroom, noise is not noticeable on the lowest fan speed. Goes through the water tanks in about a week and a half. Runs about 12 hrs a day."
4,A good read,"Has good short life stories. From pro surfer's to the average joe. Some humorus, other's scary to life changing events. Tells you about what surfer's do to find great waves or have some adventure."
5,Why Do Bad Things Happen To Good Surfers,"This book expertly delves into the surfing subculture with stories that every surfer can relate to. I have never surfed Trestles, but the stories of what went on between the surfers and the military base were hysterical. Even non-surfers I read it to found it extremely entertaining."
3,Worth the money and the time,This book is very well written and worth the money. Many of the characters and stories are news worthy and the presentation is compelling. There are some photos and the chapters are well constructed and easy to get through for old surfers (like me). My only suggestion to make this book better is that some of the stories were not that big of a deal. I felt that the author could have waited a bit longer and filled it with 100% exciting stuff. But it is 95% there now so don't hesitate to buy it.
4,awesome stories,thought the book was well written and interesting.The stories were full of adventure and gave the reader an insight of how these men and women experience the sea with all that she can muster up.I passed it on to my brother who is a long boarder and I'm sure he'll enjoy it as well.
1,Barely readable,"Peter Maas may be a successful non-fictionn writer, but on the basis of this book, as a novelist he has no talent. Taking anecdotes from real life (as Maas does over and over in this book) and arranging them in chronological order is not fiction writing -- its lazy commercialism. This book is terrible."
3,Zzzzzzz........ AdaM X could have done better...Zzzzzzzzzzzz,I was slightly disappointed with this release by AdAm X. I had seen Adam X live at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival this year and I was very impressed with his set-- so I picked up Audiobiography. I would have to be in a mellow mood to listen to this CD-- the techno was sort of minimal and that is something that I'm not too much into. Audiobiography will NOT make you want to get up and dance-- so if you're looking for a danceable CD you're not going to find that here.
5,"""Day Break"" dawns for ABC's ""FlashForward""","ABC has done it again! On October 6, 2009 ABC began the superior, complex, cerebral storyline ""FlashForward"", then totally trashed this fantastic series with discontinuous plot lines and a sporadic broadcast schedule. The season/series end-er left you with that ""Will they ever get off the island"" feeling. Whether that applies to ""FlashForward"", ""Lost"" or ""Gilligans Island"", all cause you to invest a lot of time for an incomplete story. At least with ""Day Break"", the story had closure but still left two 'outs' for possible continuation.It appears that on May 27, 2010, ""FlashForward"" blacked out for good....or has it?????"
5,Prevent the Black Out,"I was instantly intrigued when I heard about this show. I went out and read the book before it premiered, and was hooked. Though I knew the show was going to be a bit different. I put it on season pass and my husband, teenage son, and I were immediatley hooked. There has only been one other show that all three of us watch together and that was 24. The premise of Flashforward is amazing and was saddened that the show was cancelled."
5,"Great Season, needs to be brought back to air.","This show was NOT meant to be a one season show. This show is one of the best things I've seen in a while and needs to be brought back to air. I love FlashFoward so much. The plot is beautifully written and leaves me at the edge of my seat. Unlike a lot of shows that either lose you because it doesn't make sense or is beyond predictable, this show is the perfect mix of not only making sense but not being predictable. Highly recommend this buy."
5,why do they always cancel the good shows?!,"even though it was based on an existing book, i thought this show was original & entertaining. i looked forward to it every week. great actors and action. glad they are releasing it rather promptly on dvd for those of us who wish to remember it!"
5,Stellar Show! One of the Best Out There,Flash Forward is by far one of the best shows released in the last decade. Everything from the acting directing and music is on point the whole way through. This first season is incredible and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
2,WARNING DO NOT BUY,There is no proper ending. The show ends and you are left hanging.Just another way to takes money out of our pockets.
2,Looks promising... at first.,"I was hopeful about this show for the entire season. One thing I must say is that the actors did a great job. Acting was superb and that was the main thing that kept me going. The story was weak and slow. I spent the entire season telling myself that this whole thing will lead to a great finale where I will sit on the edge of my seat screaming at the TV ""Why did this have to end?!"" The show raises the question of are we truly bout to our destiny. The choices that the characters make sometimes do not make sense and it feels like the writers were trying really hard to make that character stay on his path. Eventually this long convoluted show ended in a boring finale that made me only regret the entire time i wasted behind the TV wishing for something better."
1,ABC doesn't care about you.,"ABC doesn't care about you. It only cares about money. To them there is no such thing as a satisfied customer. That's why they make shows that don't end but yet still sell them. Greed.Your only line of defense against unscrupulous people like this is to boycott ABC. Don't buy anything they produce. If everyone started boycotting ABC, then I would imagine they would have to render a more responsible account of themselves instead of cheating people."
3,Very Disappointing,"The show itself was fine. It definitely held my interest, even though it did go off on a couple of unnecessary story tangents.But, in the end, I was very disappointed.The producers certainly knew that there was a good chance that their series would be canceled at the end of the first season, yet they chose to end it with a cliff-hanger.I think that the show's loyal fans deserved a satisfactory conclusion.Michael B. Druxman"
5,Flashforward = AMAZING,"I watched Flashforward from day 1 and i have to say what a amazing show, The show is one of the best shows for many years, It keeps you on the edge of your seat so many twists and turns, This show has been wrongly cancelled it was stung by taking a break, It really does deserve a 2nd and more series, Fingers cross this will sell well and ABC come to there senses,Buy it you wont be dissapointed"
4,Early Animation Classic,"I remember being fascinated by this movie as a 7 year old boy when this movie hit the big screen.I live in Utah where Dinosaur bones are very prominent.The acting is great including the performance by Kristina Hansen, who, unfortunately for the viewing public, has made only two movies in her entire career. These are ""Dinosaurus"" in 1960, and ""Over the Edge"" in 1979. It is too bad because she is a superb actor.The timeline is a bit weird. The movie trailer states that, the dinosaurs were quick frozen 70 million years ago, while the chapters in the movie believe that these Jurassic animals were frozen 1 million years ago. This includes a Neanderthal warrior who was frozen along side the dinosaurs.Even with its time line inconsistencies, this is a fun movie for all. The audience lives through the struggle of modern people as they are forced to deal with animals that disappeared 70 or 1 million years ago."
4,Dinosaurus is a good movie,"Stop-Motion fans should check this out for it's stop-mo dinosaurs. It was made in 1960 and was double-billed with The Blob. Producer Jack H. Harris went on to produce Equinox ( 1971 ), The Blob ( 1988 remake ) and several others. The brontosaurus model later apeared in a TWILIGHT ZONE episode."
4,Great movie and music!,"I love to watch this movie over and over again. It has great music. I was very sad to find there is no soundtrack to this movie but I have found a couple of the artists names that have songs on this movie if anyone is wondering. One of the songs ""One Night"" is from The Corrs and another song that is played at the end of the movie is called ""Digge Dime"" is from Burlap to Cashmere. You can find those songs on CD's here on Amazon. Check them out! Otherwise enjoy watching the movie over and over again like do. Wish they would release this on DVD at some point."
3,if only the actors could actually dance,"I like ballroom dancing, and that's what I'm commenting on mostly. The plot is pretty typical teen romance -- boy gets girl. Not too bad, not too good.Unfortunately, neither ""Lucy"" nor ""Danny"" could actually perform what they were supposedly dancing. ""Lucy"" at least could do a few spins and looked like she had taken some dance lessons. ""Danny"" looked pretty bad as a Latin dancer. In the beginning of the movie I thought he was doing it on purpose. But his dance skill didn't improve even in the finale. That's why the dance sequence was edited into mostly upper body and head shots, even though the action of Latin dancing is below the chest level.Incidentally, the dancing feathered in the movie were samba and rumba. It would be better called Mad About Samba or Mad About Latin Dancing."
3,Warning: No Mambo,"Cute romantic comedy - watch it for the romance, for the soccer, for the actors, but don't watch it for the dancing. You ballroom people will notice right away that there is no mambo in the movie, mostly samba and a bit of rumba. That said, you don't see much of the dancing: the cameras focus mostly on the faces and leave you wondering about the footwork. Also, very limited choreography - same steps over and over throughout the film.Nevertheless, it's a fun movie overall, and the acting is very good."
5,no wimp no sellouts here pure balls to the wall metal,"i just saw overkill again monday nite 1st time since i saw them at this show man they still put on one hell of a show they are still today one of the best remaining metal bands out there distrebed,korn,linken park all should take note this cd is the way overkill sounds live raw and fast great if you,ve never seen then you must i,ve been a fane since 83 seen them 17 times one of the best live bands to see out there now yes i,m from cleveland overkills second home they love us can,t wait till they come back here this cd kicks ass and brings a lot of good memories with it for me as bobby says if not for us there would be no overkill were a diying bread metalheads this band keeps it alive they truely love there fans this cd is a must for every overkill collection new and old fans alike"
5,"Really good, worth the price!",It has been a year since my mom gave me these for my xbox. They work really well. Charge fast and last a long time. I bought them for my boyfriend and he had a problem with them. Some of the batteries are not compatible with xbox controllers. You can easily get them replaced by sending them to the company. Instructions are on the site. After he got the compatible batteries he loved them too and uses them all of the time. It is worth the money and I have had no problems with them so far.
2,Wow. No wonder this IS NOT made from Microsoft.,"This is sad.I bought this product (not from Amazon) and thought I was getting a great deal. I guess anybody thinks this is a great deal because you get 2 rechargeable batteries pack, play n' charge, and a quick charge station. The only problem is, that the play n' charge is the only thing that works the longest. The charge station work at some degree then quit after about 4 weeks. That's awful one of my battery packs also has quit. Don't buy this product at THIS PRICE, because the only the thing you're paying for is the play n' charge and one battery pack."
4,Why the bad reviews?,"When I got this product i plugged it in for about 3 hours and its been working great ever since. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because it wont charge microsoft batteries.....or so ive heard. and seeing as i havent found a nyko battery for sale by itself, you kind of dont have an option if you got a friend over playing. if both of your batteries die at the same time then you would just have to wait 3 hours to play again and thats pretty lame. like i said though, it works great just like its supposed to"
5,Got it with the 360 and it is definitly worth it!,When I fist got my 360 I figured I'd be playing a lot a didn't want to have to worry about batteries. I bought this for $30 at the time and have been using it ever since. I get great battery life off of this thing and it has been all I've used for batteries in my 2 wireless controllers. I am very happy to have gotten this product and would recommend it with any new 360 purchase.
1,"um, please don't say it...","i was a little disgusted with this product. If you were like me, you wanted to find an alternative battery pack than the one microsoft provides. i thought these were fine up until they made the batteries not usable in the wireless controllers. I suggest you get the other battery packs and the other charger, much better products."
1,No longer cheaper than the Microsoft-brand product.,"Bought the Nyko Power Charger combo, which includes this plus a charging cable.Xbox 360 Power Charger Combo (Charge Station, Power Kit)Works on the wireless controller that came with my system no problem, but would flash green lights on the new Microsoft controller I just bought. A google search showed that Microsoft did a small redesign on their wireless controller, which affects certain 3rd party batteries (like Nyko's). Nyko is in the process of releasing compatible batteries and replacing the old ones I bought, but it is utterly pointless to buy this just to save a few dollars.Save yourself the headache and just buy the Microsoft-brand Quick Charge Kit $25.99) and Play & Charge cable (14.99). These together cost you $40.98, which is a whole $1 more than this piece of crap."
1,This product doesn't work,"Bought the Nyko Charge Station the other day. Opened the package, plugged the charge station into the outlet, and waited. After the batteries had charged, I put them in my controllers. Neither of the two batteries worked. The light around the power button on the controllers blinks endlessly and never settles. The console wouldn't recognize the controllers. I'm taking it back to the store today and getting the Microsoft product. This NYKO product sucks, and I would tell everyone to not waste their money on this one."
2,This unit will not charge MS rechargable batteries.. be warned,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I'd had no problems with this unit itself, or the Nyko provided batteries, it was very clear to me that you needed to take off the clear stickers on the batteries.What I will confirm is that no way, no how, this unit will not charge the OEM Microsoft rechargeable batteries. If you want to buy it to replace using AA batteries, it's great, but don't buy it to charge MS Rechargeable battery packs.Also to confirm, Nyko customer service doesn't have a clue, I called and emailed multiple times, asked ""will this charge a MS battery pack? A: yes of course it does, yours must be defective, send it back"" and while I've had 2 replacements, neither will charge the Microsoft rechargeable battery pack."
1,Worthless!,"Yes this product was cheaper than Microsoft's charger station and has one more battery, but oh was I so wrong in buying this product. Yes it DOES charge my Microsoft battery and the Nyko batteries as well, however the Nyko batteries malfunction when in my controller and act as if the right trigger on the controller is being held down. I would not sugest this product to someone out of spite."
1,How do you screw up a rechargeable battery?,Bought and returned 2 of these things. Each had a bad battery.Seriously.
4,works for me,"Short and sweet, got this as an xmas present from my wife. Works great, only gripe is the nyko batteries dont fit perfectly. I have had it for a few years, no problems whatsoever. Batteries are just a hair too big, but they fit. I recommend this product. Charges official batteries too."
3,360 charger,"Well it works, it come with two battery's but I only one of them worked. which was disappointing. Thats why I picked this one, because come with two of them."
1,Not worth the savings,"""Oh man, 2 batteries and 8 bucks cheaper!"" I thought.... just spend the extra money and get the microsoft one. After fiddling with it for 10 min, one of the batteries finally started to charge, but I had to remove it and put it back on twice before it fully charged. The other battery never would charge."
1,Don't Bother,"I picked this up hoping it would be on par with the Microsoft Charging Station. Not even close! The first one I got would not light up or charge a thing. Exchanged it for a new one. This one would flicker on, but then turn off and not charge the batteries at all. I gave up after two tries. Spend the extra cash for the Microsoft one, it is much more reliable."
2,Bad packaging,"I would give these batteries five stars, HOWEVER, their marketing/product development department needs to GET A CLUE, hence the 2 star rating.Like most of the reviewers I've read, the batteries don't seem to work out-of-the-box. You plug-in the charge station and the lights blink green for a moment and then go out. Plug them into the controller and they don't work.Why don't they work?As one reviewer noted, the batteries have a clear-plastic sticky-strip over the terminal leads on the back of the battery. They were nearly impossible to see unless you know they're there. Remove the strip and they work perfectly.So why does the company need to get a clue?Nearly all of the product returns could have been avoided if they spent the extra $.001 and printed ""REMOVE BEFORE USE"" on the clear plastic strip."
2,Stick with the genuine Microsoft charger...,"The Nyko batteries are larger than the standard Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller batteries. They need to be forced into the Xbox controllers or into the Microsoft Quick Charge Kit. Since the batteries are larger, they don't always make contact with the charging units/controllers. This is probably the problem that other people have experienced when they claim the Nyko batteries are defective.If you don't mind using some force to jam these batteries into your controller, then maybe this product is for you. Just keep in mind you get what you pay for. The Xbox 360 Quick Charge Kit is just a far superior product."
1,Buy the MS product instead.,"I know this product is about $8 cheaper, plus the cost of a 2nd battery, but I wouldn't recommend it. It started with the annoying packaging from the start, where you must remove the plastic sheath in order to charge the battery and went downhill quickly. I had 1 of the batteries in my controller and the controller stopped working properly about a day after I started using it... the controller would stop responding in the middle of a game or would respond in a haphazard manner (trying to move left would move forward instead, etc.) I returned the item to Toys R US and got the MS quick charger instead and have had no problems."
1,charge station,"This is a total rip off, do not buy this product. I bought one thinking it looked like a good deal and it never worked, the batteries never charged and the LED ligts never worked. Thinking it was just one bad item i returned it and exchanged it for another, and that one also did not work, don't waste your money or time on this thing, the offical x-box quick charger actually works."
2,Won't charge Microsoft batteries,"My Xbox 360 Elite came bundled with theXbox 360 Play & Charge Kit - Black. I was very disappointed to find the Nyko charge station won't recharge the OEM Microsoft batteries. I returned the Nyko and got theXbox 360 Quick Charge Kit.Yeah, the Microsoft charger is more expensive and only comes with one battery, so by the time I bought the charger and aXbox 360 Rechargeable Controller Battery Pack, I wound up spending about fifteen bucks more, total. I think it is well worth the convenience of having one charger that works with all of my batteries."
5,Works great,"Some of the other reviews mentioned dead units out of the box but I think they might have been foiled by packaging. I plugged in mine straight out of the box, saw the brief green flashing and then nothing. When I checked the individual battery units I found that clear plastic material was present over the battery contacts. When you peel those off the battery units charge up just fine and work perfect."
3,Fire Hazard?,I haven't seen anyone else report this problem but my charger became so hot that the metal on the underside partially melted and deformed. When I felt the bottom it was extremely hot--hot enough that I no longer feel totally comfortable charging my batteries with it.Until this incident I would probably have given it five stars. In the past it has charged the batteries without difficulty and they seem to last forever.
1,It's a better deal not to buy!,"I had got this garbage charger for Christmas, and needless to say its going back. For an extra $10-$15 buy the XBOX 360 charger and buy an additional XBOX 360 NiMH battery. From my experience, any aftermarket iteam for 360 is just not worth what your going to save, this includes controllers, chargers, and even the Nyko cooling fan. Hope this helps."
2,Xbox 360 Charge Station Review,"This is the second Charge Station I bought, the first was great! Long life on the batteries! I liked it so much I bought another, but this one, One of the batteries never charged right out of the box. The other battery is fine, but it seems to be a little tighter fit than the other three, so overall I believe its a good product, but this particular one seems to be a lemon... :("
4,Have had mine for over a year.,I have had this charger system for over a year and have experienced zero problems.
1,There is better products,"This product come with a bad battery only one of two are working, think twice to buy this s**t"
2,Charge Station,"The Charge Station works and charges, but the battery packs with the station don't even fit and work in my wireless controllers. I wasn't pleased. Go with another product if you are looking for some extra packs as well."
5,What Fun!,Tamar Myers Pennsylvania Dutch Amish mysteries is are just 'plain' fun. This most recent installment keeps the fun and interest rolling along. Newcomers to this series might like to know that the recipes included in each book are good recipies. Want a rollicking good time?....read this book!
5,Fun and informative,"Tamar Myers really knows how to include some of the ""Dutch"" culture in a good plot. She has fun weaving an interesting plot and at times creates bizarre habits for the charcters in her story. She also gives the reader an understanding of some of the customs of the Pennsylvania Dutch people. I have enjoyed all of this series and the recipes too. I look forward to the next book in this series."
1,Yoder really does need to take a hike.,I usually enjoy reading about quirky characters but Yoder is more of a quack instead. She pretends to be off beat when in reality she is actually off base. It would be nice indeed if Tamar Myers stops writing about Yoder and did somthing else altoghether. This is the first Yoder mystery I have read. I am not going to be in any hurry to read any of the others.
1,"Where's the ""mystery""?","This was my first encounter with this author, and sadly, will very likely be my last. I could not stay with the plot, nor could the author. It was hard to decide whether this was to be a comedy (although the humor often escaped me), historical (lots of ""facts"" regarding the Mennonite and Amish way of life) or a genuine mystery. I agree with previous posters...the ""vailed"" innuendos with regard to her pet kitten just don't come across the way I believe they have been intended.Fortunately, there are some very good mystery writers available to keep me reading for years to come. I really don't like to be so critical, but I was really turned off by this book."
1,Hysterical stabs at humor.,"The plot was scarcely credible considering the main character, portrayed as unworldly and simple to the point of stupidity, actually solved a mystery. The hysterical stabs at humor, an aberration - decadence disguided as innocence - detracted from the whole and was offensive, especially from a writer purported to be of Amish roots, a claim evidently employed for ""filthy lucre's sake"" (Titus 1:11)."
2,Time to retire Magdalena,"This series has been delightful, but the last few books have not measured up to the first ones. The author seems to have run out of fresh ideas for the main character, Magdalena. As much as I have enjoyed these Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries, I think it's time for the author to move on to a new series where she can once again display her talent in creating interesting and quirky characters."
4,the Crepes of Wrath,"I grew up Mennonite and find this book quite realistic and hilarious in some of the characterizations that are made. This was the first book I read of Tamar Myers, but it definately won't be the last."
1,Don't Buy This Book!,After reading the sample I was intrigued. Then I downloaded the Kindle edition and was instantly appalled when I got to the very next chapter (after the freebie). She carries her cat around in her bra? How ridiculous. The book only got worse. I feel like I was fleeced out of $6.99. Don't waste a single penny on this book. My first Tamar Myers book and most definately my last.
2,Waste of pulp,"I am an avid reader of mysteries and was thrilled to find Tamar Myers as she looks prolific. Thrilled that is until I actually read ""Crepes of Wrath."" Awful! The heroine, Magdalena Yoder, is a sanctimonious bore at best with a juvenile humor at worst. Her puns are sophomoric and offensive; her 'wailing' every other page is downright irritating. ...."
1,Boring,"I read the Crepes of Wrath over the last weekend. I was extremely disappointed. As an avid reader of mysteries and a descendant of Pennsylvania Dutch, I looked forward to this book. I was hoping to find a new series that I would enjoy. The plot was silly and the characters even more so. Hoping it would get better, I plowed through to the end. It is one of the few books I have thrown across the room in frustration."
3,Not the Best,"Magdalena wakes up one morning to find a parnoid, postmisstress, Thelma Hershberger peeking through her bedroom window. Thelma thinks whoever killed Lizzie Mast (who was killed from angledust) is after her because she saw a blackmail note to Lizzie the day of her death. Magdalena thinks Thelma should tell this to Melvin Stoltfus Chief of Police. the second the words are out of her mouth she knows they sound stupid rumor has it he was kicked in the head by a bull he was trying to milk. He also sent his favorite aunt ice cream by UPS. She knew she had another mystery on her hands. She assures Thelma that she will be fine. Little does she know that that's not the case. Now having two murders to solve and inn full of guests plus the drug ring opreation she has he hands full."
4,A clever plot twist,A surprisingly good story for the B-movie western type. Perhaps one of the best films with William Elliot.
4,Don't be Cruel !,"Anyone who has been to see Connie in concert recently would be pleasantly suprised to hear how well she sounds on this, her most recently recording. The band is rocking. She even throws in a cute little threat to smack some girl right in the mouth on the Peggy Sue cover. I believe that Buddy Holly himself would find little to complain about in her renditions. There are no soaring vocals here - the songs themselves do not call for it. This cd can go around again & again and you'll still be singing along!"
3,Disapointing,"My expectations were sadly disapponted. I expected a great deal of variety as in ""Getz Gilberto."" I find it a little boring."
1,Not much dancing at all..,"This is a very poor rendition of Coppelia. There is hardly any dancing and what little there is can hardly be recommended. Comparing this to the Australian Ballet standard resolution DVD this blu-ray version from POB comes out poorly even given the superior digital medium. The interpretation, choreography, sets, costumes (female is OK, male is hideous),amount of dancing, almost everything, is inferior. The Australian production DVD is not the best technical quality but given that, it shines and is a vastly better acquisition. Being a fan of POB in general I am disappointed in this purchase. Please avoid this and save yourself money. I wish I had an accurate review to rely on before making this purchase."
2,"I saw it on stage, and disliked it immensely","Inasmuch as I like Monsieur Bart personally, I cannot stomach his works, because he simply does not add anything of value to the ballets he ""over-writes."" One or two clever touches here and there does not make one a good choreographer. Even if the DVD were entitled, ""Choreography by Bart, set to incidental music by Delibes"" (as one reviewer seems to suggest, for the sake of truth in advertising), it would not be worth the money. I would have walked out of the performance I attended at the Palais Garnier, had I not paid a small fortune for tickets.Sole positive point(e): Dorothee Gilbert is an up-and-coming Etoile with a great future ahead of her at the POB."
3,Good 1st book for potential dog owner,"If you're looking to get a dog and you don't have any dog books, this could be a good general one on the selection, care, and training of a dog, specifically a bichon. I have a bichon, and would definitely like to see more details on items covered, such as what to do about hot spots, why bichons run in circles, etc. The author tends to repeat himself, too. I would suggest other books that compare breeds if not sure on a breed, or get another book on training or puppies. This book is a good intro, but can't stand on its own."
3,I'd love it if it's more in detail,"The book was written by a renowned Bichon breeder, which is very impressive. Everything she wrote is true but I wish she went in detail some more as to how to train a puppy...what kind of training to use...i.e., positive reinforcement...etc. I was also hoping she would tackle on problems behavioral problems that one might experience with a bichon. Overall it's a good book if you want a bird's eyeview on this kind of breed. I'm still looking for books that are more in depth with regards to the topic, Bichon Frise."
2,Basic Bichon,"I was disappointed that this book was so basic. Was just not what I was looking for but I've owned dogs for years, but it would be good for a first time pet owner."
4,To the auther,I enjoied this book. I'm sorry about your dog. I have a bichon to and she is very close to me.
4,toy light?,"Cannot for the life of me understand why Amazon calls this a ""toy""...oh well...on with the review.I brought this for my Intex metal frame 15' above ground pool. it is for rails much larger than the pipes that make up the Intex pool!The supplied adapter had to be modified greatly in order for it to work.Installation issues aside...this light looks really great in the pool at night!"
3,excellent history of English royalty,"An interesting novel, at times couldn't put it down. At least it wasn't boring like some historical novels."
3,"Good, but could have been better","I love historical fiction and this one was pretty good, though could have been so much better. There is too much skipping ahead for one thing. For example, Mr.Churchill would go on these missions that Sarah hated him for doing, and always complained about how much she missed him, yet a few pages later he'd have returned (this being theoretically many months or a year later) safely into her arms, feeling to me like he had never left at all. Same thing happened whenever she became pregnant, almost as if her pregnancies were back to back when they really were not. I'll read the other books Miss Scott has written, and hope those are more promising. This title was still enjoyable and worth it, so I would recommend it for any historical fiction readers looking to kill some time."
2,Mop is flimsy,"I bought a Starmop. They clean easily and well, but the grips to hold the micro fiber pads on are flimsy and break easily. I attempted to contact Starmop directly and they don't appear to respond to comments well (I have never gotten an answer)."
3,Fill in,"I knew what I was getting here, as I had the vinyl version years ago. Three good, rocking songs, and the balance a step down from those."
3,Cool,"This isn't bad considering they are country music's version of N'SYNC. Songs such as: I Melt, My Worst Fear and Mayberry are awesome. I just wish they would lose the ""boy band"" persona and just be themselves."
5,PERFECTION,"I very rarely find a CD and absolutely love every single track on it. Rascal Flatts MELT is an exception. The first time I listened to the CD through, I fell in love. I love every single track on Melt! It doesn't get any better than this. This album is exploding with amazing lyrics and music--every single, unique track is my favorite!"
5,Great CD,What else can you say about Rascal Flatts....this CD is great listening. I pop it into my CD player in the car and listen to it all the time.
5,a must have,"it's obvious that some people don't listen to pop. this cd, and this group should hardly even be compared to pop. and either way, who cares? if you like it you like it if you don't you don't. but i for one would strongly recomend this cd. i love it think that the Rascal Flatts are very talented and very good at what they do. in my opinion this is a must have cd. if you liked the first one you'll like this one as well."
5,Three Cheers For Rascal Flatts!,"This album is one of the best releases of the year, and every track is enjoyable to listen to. It is an improvement over their first album, but both are excellent. You've probably heard ""These Days,"" and this CD has the extended version of the song on it. My favorites are ""I Melt,"" ""Fallin' Upside Down,"" and ""Too Good Is True."" If you have liked any of Rascal Flatts' songs on the radio, you will like this album. Pay no attention to the amazon.com reviewer; he probably does not like contemporary country music. My rating is a 9.5/10. Enjoy the samples, and buy this CD!"
4,Rascal Flatts not up to par,"On their second time out, Rascal Flatts once again blend their exquisite vocal harmonies with rolling pop-country hooks and high-energy beats. They seem to have matured a lot, both in vocals and lyrics, and their songs don't seem to be as bubbly on this album as on their last. A great album for the pop-country fan, Rascal Flatts will knock your socks off with their electrifying style and charming look and sound. That being said, however, Rascal Flatts' sophomore release is nowhere near as good as their debut. The first album had tons of energy, youthful exuberance, great vocals, and a full disc of excellent songs. This record seems to be missing something - their song choice is not nearly as brilliant. The lyrics and musical arrangements are lacking. Their performance of the songs, as always, is excellent...but they could have done so much better. Fans should buy this, but if you're looking for your first pop-country album, go for Rascal Flatts' debut instead."
2,What happened to country music,"If I wanted a cheesy boy band pop cd I should have bought the backstreet boys. What happened to country music??? Artists like faith hill, Shania Twain, Tim Mcgraw and Rascal Flatts to name a fewe are selling out and leaving their roots. I guess George Strait and Alan Jackson were right, murder has been committed on music row. If you are a fan of real country music don't but this cd."
2,Melt CD,I received the CD in a reasonable amount of time but unfortunately the CD was not in A1 shape. There is a scratch on the CD and one of the songs on the CD skips A LOT which is disappointing.
5,"If you're a true country fan, you should own this album!!!!","This is such a great cd...It is the perfect album for a long drive! I would recommend their previous cd ""Rascal Flatts"" also! Great buy!!"
2,Same song with 11 verses,"I bought the CD because I liked the first track-These Days. But the last 10 tracks are the same song. Yes, all 11 tracks are good, but they sound the same. Get the single, pass on the rest."
3,rascal flatts- Melt,"Yeah, Rascal Flatts have some catchy melodies,pretty voices, but what kind of ""COUNTRY"" music is this? I mean, the only country song is ""My Worst Fear."" Riding the country vs. pop fence is a difficult task. It can really shorten careers of some really TALENTED artists. If you're going to promote & sale your CD in the country section @ records stores, shouldn't there be a lil' more country on it? Don't get me wrong, they can write,sing,& play, but Gary LeVox is singing a lil' more like Michael Jackson instead of Haggard & Jones. :)I don't know if I'd advise spending your last $ to get this, ask for it as a gift or get it @ pawn shop. If you're open minded this an okay album to own. :)"
2,Newbies are OK,"This CD has a few songs that are good with great hooks. Overall this new effort is a work in progress.The harmonies by the members of this band are really fine, but, as other reviewers have noted, there are a lot of filler songs presented among the few goodies like this CD signature song ""I Melt"". This has happened to other new artists as they evolve, and as Rascal Flatts are fairly fresh to the country-rock scene they have lots of room to roam in their style and to grow as songwriters. And, unlike the yuk!inducing hip hop garbage that rules radio ad nauseum, Rascal Flatts are real musicians. You go guys!"
2,Second from Rascal Flatts falls flatt!,"I liked the first Rascal Flatts CD so much I bought and gave away at least 10 copies to friends. I might just give ""Melt"" away completely!The opening number ""These Days"" is the only truly impressive cut here. The rest are throwaway generic tunes with simplistic (some might say moronic) and utterly forgettable lyrics.Make no mistake - these boys can sing, but it's a very unfortunate and disappointing group of songs. Anyone who thinks ""Melt"" is better than RF's great first CD is wishing and not listening."
1,Wow - there's so much quality country music on the airwaves!,"Rascal Flatts! more like Parasitical Brats - these guys are a total joke. The lead singer looks like a boy band reject on account of his busted face and bulging gut - Rascal Flatts Rascal Flatts Rascal Flatts - say it over and over - it's one of the most idiotic band names every to plague mankind! Imagine wearing a Rascal Flatts t-shirt? It's like writing the word jackass on your forehead - my God...the saddest part is that these guys are getting laid because of this weak-ass music...""I meeelllllt!"" hahaha! I heard the bass players leaving to start his own band, ""Diabolical Cats"" and the drummer is gonna split and join a group called Scallywag Prairie""! Goodluck yambags, Enjoy!"
3,Getting better with each listen,"Good, but not as impressive on the first couple of listens as the first RF. Maybe I was expecting something different. Maybe I am put off by the ""I'm not gonna smile into the camera because my record company doesn't want me to look like I am happy"" or ""We will airbrush every single photo to make these boys look unnatural and more sexy"" pix. Maybe. I am enjoying it more and more every time I listen. Nice ""Nashville Pop"" for fans of the first RF, SheDaisy and Tim McGraw."
5,Awesome CD,"This is a great CD!! I originally bought the CD because I absolutely love the track, ""Love You Out Loud"" but the whole CD is good! You don't have to love country music to love Rascal Flatts. I usually listen to soft-punk and heard ""Love You Out Loud"" on the radio when I was flipping through stations, and bought the cd the next week after listening to the other song clips on this site! I especially like the more up tempo songs like ""Too Good Is True"" and ""Shine On"" and of course, ""Love You Out Loud"". The slower songs are good too, such as ""These Days"" and ""You"". I think that the CD is worth the money spent."
5,"Small Guys, Big Voices","Straight from the cover, I thought, these guys look small. They have big bad voices, and know how to use them. Is it me or is Nashville getting a little more Soul in its blood?? These boys definately have soul and are always willing to use it. I love Rascal Flatts and i hope they become HUGE like they deserve"
5,Great wine pourer,This wine pourer works beautifully! I got several more to have on hand for gifts as I was so impressed with it.
5,The best wine gadget that I have bought,"I bought the first one for a stocking stuffer for my husband this past Christmas, and everyone that has seen it in use has asked where we purchased it. It has a smooth pouring action with no drippage down the bottle; before I bought this, my husband would tie a paper napkin around the neck of the wine bottle to prevent the drippage staining tablecloths, etc... The added extra bonus is that it is also a stopper for an open unfinished bottle of wine. I have since purchased six more of these to give as gifts to family and friends."
2,Fix for stretched rubber,"When originally purchased, it works great. The design for the stopper is nice, and no complaints.However after a few months (insertion in a bottle about once every 3 days), the rubber wrapping where it inserts into the bottle gradually fatigues and stretches to the point it will no longer insert into a bottle.I purchased a second one (not from Amazon), hoping the first failure was a fluke, but the same thing happened with the second one.A stopper from a different manufacturer with a solid rubber core has proven much more reliable.UPDATE: I found that by using a razor blade to remove the stretched flap of rubber at the bottom of the stopper (just below the raised ring), it can be ""repaired"" so it will again insert into bottles and is still useful."
2,There are better options,"For $5 it's not bad but they don't hold up in the dishwasher and still dribble. It works better than the Oxo pourer/stopper (poor seal and twice the price at $10).OXO SteeL Wine Stopper/Pourer CombinationFor your money I recommend Prodyne--they hold up in the dishwasher, have maintained better suction and are a great price at 2 for $9.Prodyne WP-2 2-in-1 Wine Pourer/Stopper, Set of 2I work for a winery and have used dozens of different pourers. The Prodyne continually gets compliments at my house and are what I have chosen to get for gifts from now on."
5,Really like this thing,Purchased one of these for a Christmas present. My girlfriend and I drink wine and get frustrated when the wine drips all over the place after pouring. This eliminates that and provides an easy way to keep the wine fresh. Purchased more of these to give as presents to friends. Recommend this product.
4,a nice addition to any home bar,I have been using the Metrokane Wine Pourer for several years. For the price it is one of my most essential items in my home bar. Really I don't need it for the pouring but rather when we dont finish off the bottle of wine and want to stick it back in the fridge for another day or so. They do stretch out and thus you will need to replace them over time and I have had problems with some bottles not fitting them correctly but all in all you get a solid pour with no dripping and helps keep wine fresh when putting back in the fridge. Worth its weight in wine.
2,"Works fine, but the Prodyne pourer is better","I purchased a few wine stoppers and tried each out. See the customer photos for side-by-side shots. This is the only one I don't plan to use again. It's certainly fine, but it isn't as good as theProdyne Wine Pourer. The Metrokane pourer drips whereas the Prodyne has a lip that directs drips back into the bottle itself. The Metrokane stopper is also more difficult to get into the bottle and I'm skeptical it will fit all bottles; it is not clear when it is really ""in"" and ready to poor whereas the Prodyne settles nicely on the bottle. We don't store bottles on their side, so I cannot say whether this stopper is better/worse than the Prodyne pourer in that respect.I'd also recommend theMetrokane Wine Sealerover this pourer. While the sealer is not a ""pourer"", I don't think that feature is great on this Metrokane pourer anyways. Additionally, the Metrokane sealer will definitely seal a bottle and prevent leaks (it even works with champagne)."
5,Pour-fect!,"Love these wine pourers! I received some off of my wedding registry and love them! Since then I purchased a couple for my parents, who enjoy their wine! They are quick and easy to use, much better than trying to get the cork back in or leaving the bottle open."
2,Cheap and Ineffective,"The first time I used it, it worked well. The second time, the rubber piece moves so that it does not fit snuggly into the bottle. This product is cheaply made and does not do what it is supposed to do."
2,Great until the rubber gets warped,"It was great for nine months and never had a leak until the rubber around the stopper mouth became loose. After that, it would no longer fit in the bottle and was completely useless. I'm going to try to find another product. It's a shame because it truly never drips when you pour yourself a glass of wine."
4,Good product,"This product has made it much easier to serve wine without spilling, splashing or wasting. Easy, convenient and well made, it has made for interesting conversation and interest to others."
5,A must-have!,"We have owned this wine stopper/pourer for 8 months and love it! Easy to use, attractive, easy to clean...now I buy it for friends!"
1,Makes the wine bottle too tall for my refrigerator shelves.,"So it's rather useless, and in fact I haven't used it at all since I bought it. Better to get the bottle savers that have the little lever on them, or the kind that work like corks, because if the bottle saver adds two to three inches to the height of the bottle, you really limit your options as to where you can put the bottle."
1,Metrokane Wine Pourer,I bought this item at the same time I bought their Rabbit Electric Wine Opener.Both are a waste of money.Neither product works.Total GARBAGE!!!!!
1,Did not even last a month,"I purchased three as gifts and one for myself. It was great for several weeks and agree it did not leak. After almost a month of use, the rubber around the stopper mouth came loose and therefore will no longer fit in the bottle. It is completely useless at this point, especially for the price. I have no idea of there is any warranty on a product like this but let's hope the gifts I bought do not get usage."
4,Good for wine drinkers,"I like this pourer/stopper. It fits well, so I don't worry about it falling out as I pour and the stopper is easy to put in and take out. A very good item for the money, especially as part of the free shipping promotion."
2,Wine Bottle Stopper Seal Not Durable,"It is a great idea - stopper and pourer in the same device. And it is reasonably priced, works really well for a short time but does not last very long. The seal between the pourer and the wine bottle startes leaking after about a month. I also wish the stopper was tethered to the pourer by a nylon string so that it cannot get lost. It will be a good product for wine drinkers if they can make the seal with the wine bottle durable."
4,Conversation Piece That Is Functional,This wine pourer with stopper has a weird appearance but it works well! It is a great pourer; just do not lay the bottle on its side. It leaks. It lets you pour wine with class! Accept it for what it is; it is a wine pourer and a conversation piece! I recommend.
2,good pourer poor stopper,"This product works great as a pourer and looks somewhat stylish, however as a stopper it is poor. The stopper piece works only with the wine stored vertically. So if you put this on its side in the fridge it will leak. If you have room to store bottles vertically this works ok, but it is not reliable if wine is stored horizontally."
4,Very VERY comprehensive,"I give this book a ""7"" mostly because Scally should get a lot of credit for all the research he did for this book. It's very obvious. However, I would not recommend it if you are looking for a quick and easy read. This book is best for someone studying the famine and migration of the Irish to America."
4,Super fun book.,"Super fun. I like vampires, it is sort of a hobby of mine. this book is wonderfully illustrated with ""hand written side notes"" and side sketches add an authenticity to the reading experience. It seems more like a diary than a published Handbook. It also contains all the necessary information for spotting, tracking and hunting the forces of evil. I would recommend to anyone who likes vampires and ghouls to get this book. Great Price. Good Seller and the quality of the binding is good. The book is rather small though."
1,complete garbage,"it's funny to read but it's basically some demented priest's guide on slaying make believe vampires. it has no historical credibility at all and really is a bunch of imaginary superstitious junk that this mentally unstable person came up with. (and not mentally unstable in a good interesting way but in a boring preach about superstitious evil way.) like the other reviewer said it's funny for a laugh but really it's garbage and that's exactly were my copy of it went.oh, and if your of a pagan religion it's probably going to really offend you since this person considers them barbaric..."
1,A Good Laugh,"I really find this book funny and hope no one takes it seriously. As a ""vampire expert"" one would think that his book would be more informed. It's not. If you are looking for a good laugh, this book is the one for you. If you want to read something more serious or study study vampires for the academic aspect, you can do a lot better."
4,Those silly French!,"This is a short and concise history. It's easy to read and very good for young students interested in Native American history. Not Dr. Cave's best work, but it's very informative and enlightening.[ASIN:031332168X The French and Indian War (Greenwood Guides to Historic Events 1500-1900)] Buy from Book&Tek&Things for $19.99 + shipping."
1,Absolutely dreadful!,"This book reads like 12-15 encylcopedia articles strung together, and gets waaaaaaaaaaaay off subject. A long ethnohistorical essay is included (among several others of dubious relation to the F&I War) on Native Americans that has very little to do with the subject and is very much out of place. Many details are wrong--dates of birth, names, etc. This is a ""don't buy"". Go for Fred Anderson's ""Crucible of War"" instead."
3,Mixed feelings about this book...would like more romance,"The idea of this book was great. The hero and heroine have to complete a number of tasks set out by the heroine's grandmother in her will. The grandmother was a noted courtesan, whose patron was the earl's grandfather. There are some interesting tasks, with a clever treasure hunt. My major problem was that I didn't feel that enough time was spent developing what the hero and heroine saw in each other, and why they grew to love each other. The writing was good, and it was an interesting slice of regency life, but I wanted more character development and more romance. I liked this book, but didn't love it, because it didn't really touch my emotions. I do think that the author showed a lot of potential, and I would try her future books."
3,Better than average Regency,"I gave it 3 stars, but it's really more like 3.5 stars. I did not feel justified in giving it 4. It's an interesting twist on the plot, and the characters are likeable enough. It is a bit light in the romance department, sometimes slow, and the resolution of the young niece too easy. Still it's pleasant and interesting enough to be recommended for a light read and to consider reading this author again."
1,A GOOD COP WITH A BAD GHOST WRITER,A GOOD DETAIL OF ONE LAWMANS WORK AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME. BOOK IN THE READERS VIEWPOINT IS THAT IT IS TOO HEAVILY LACED WITH KUDO'S FOR HIS PAST ASSOCIATES. FOUND LITTLE INFORMATION THAT WAS GOTTI RELATED. FEALT THE AUTHOR COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB IF THE BOOK WAS PRESENTED AS AN HONEST BIOGRAPHY OF A CRIME FIGHETER WHO BEGAN TO COME INTO GOTTI IN THE LATER YEARS OF HIS LAW ENFORCEMENT CAREER. I DON'T LIKE TO BE NEGATIVE ABOUT THE BOOK AS I HAVE THE UTMOST REPECT FOR THE MAN HAVING STUDIED SOME OF HIS PAST CLIPPINGS. I SURE WISH THE AUTHOR COULD DO A BOOK FOR US ON THE CORUPTION BETWEEN THE GAMBINO FAMILY AND THE NYPD.
1,MISSING 8 PAGES,The feeble Dramatists Play Service Inc. booklet for Will Eno's THOM PAIN (based on nothing) arrived missing pages 3-8. I just don't have the time or energy to go through the return process. Will have to imagine my own beginning. Watch out.
5,"Serious, Smart Training","Along with Jack Daniel's Running Formula, this book is the best of its kind. It shows you the right way to train and tells you how to do it. This book is great for a beginner as well as an advanced runner. the training programs are easy to understand and they work, whether you race a 5K or marathon. It explains the right pace to use for each workout, whether it be an easy day or speed session. If you want better race times, read this book and train the right way. Use this book as your running bible."
2,not that great,"this is not that great a toothbrush, certainly not compared to the braun model. the head makes a lot of noise but doesn't vibrate much when against your teeth. wouldn't recommend."
5,Good product. Recall issue is long since resolved,"I just purchased the product and I like it!Of course I was initially concerned about the recall, but I after some research I decided that the reason behind the recall wouldn't affect me at all.Essentially, the recall occurred because three special needs (cerebral palsy, autism, etc) people bit the release latch and swallowed the brush head! None of the special needs people suffered permanent injury. There was also a small number of other reports of brush heads becoming loose in the mouth, but those brush heads weren't swallowed and no injury occurred.In early 2005, Gillete redesigned the brush head so the problem wouldn't happen anymore. Also, Oral-B graciously offered to replace the product for consumers that have the older brush head design.Details about the recall can be found here:[...]"
1,Review for recalled item,"All oral-b crossaction power and crossaction power max battery powered toothbrushes and any related refills are a recall item by oral-b. Refer to www.oral-b.com ,click on recall notice on this site. You can read for yourself about the consumer warning for this item. Oral-b has the best customer service I have seen, along with their sister company, Braun. When I call oral-b and Braun, they are very professional and wonderful to me-I think I owe them this assistance. Again, Braun and oral-b have the best customer service I have ever experienced. Ken Conner"
3,Cohesive single menu book,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is OK and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. Contains typical British recipes with a good order so that most of the recipes could form part of a single menu (revolving around a roast, yorkshire puddings and desert).This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
3,A cookbook for children.,"BE WARNED: THIS IS A CHILDREN'S COOK BOOK. IT IS NOT WORTH $25.00 - DO NOT PAY $25.00 FOR IT!! It is the MOST perfunctory little book you will ever find on English Cookery. And at 72 pages, it is a little book indeed - teeny tiny! The book is for very, very new cooks. There is a recipe for tea. And while it IS important that one knows how to make a proper pot of tea - it's not a cookbook for anyone over ten years of age. There are tips for the would-be cook such as pull back your long hair so that it doesn't get in the food or lift a lid on a steaming pot away from your face so that you don't get burned. You understand. As an adult, you'd be much better served by ""PIE"" written by Angela Boggiano."
1,Chilltown Christmas,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my 67 years of age. I would not recommend it to anyone. Very depressing, very gang...Baltimore style...movie. I broke it and threw it away."
3,Useless if you live in the Southwest,The thing about all these regional plant books that irritates the Hell out of me is the ignoring of high Summer temperatures when it comes to plant selection. They ALWAYS focus on cold weather hardiness. Will SOMEONE please write a book about horticulture in regions where the Summers produce temperatures consistently in the triple digits (105 - 120F) for 60 to 100 consecutive days?! I would LOVE to find a book that tells me what I can plant in the ground or in a pot that can survive the Summers where I live (low desert of Southern California).
3,JAGUARES/ CRONICAS DE UN LABERINTO,"Como el titulo del disco sugiere este disco de jaguares es un laberinto de decepcion, la verdad yo esperaba mucho este disco con una gran expectativa, pero la verdad suena muy predecible no hay ninguna evolucion musical,me parece la misma formula del primer instinto, desafortunadamente con este disco no paso nada, ojala y la banda aprendan de este disco a no hacer algo igual, porque sin lugar a dudas esta es una de las mejores bandas dentro del rock en espanol. yo me considero un fan de esta banda, pero no de este disco."
2,Another Disappointment,"The Jaguares have failed again. After I got their last album ""El Primer Instinto"" I thought their next one would be better. I was wrong. This is probably the weakest Jaguares album to date. No lie, it's boring and only has one track that stands out. The best song on it is ""Hay Amores Que Matan"" the first single from the album. Download this song and save your money. I don't hate the Jaguares, I'm just a frustrated fan. I know they can do better. Remember ""Bajo El Azul..""?"
4,I love Jaguares,"I too am getting sick of comparing Jaguares to Caifanes. If you want Caifanes go break out your El Silencio cd. Like most groups, they've evolved and their sound has changed. I don't know how people expect Jaguares to have the same sound they did 15+ years ago. Then people would be complaining that their music all sounds the same. People will always have something to complain about and so is life. If you don't like it, don't buy it and if you already bought it then sell it. Hi, ebay.I particularly liked this album. I love ""Tu me Liberas"" and ""Me Evaporo."" The cd is very melodic and very soothing but that's Saul's voice for you. This is just an album you can relax to for the most part. Saul's voice is amazing still even after everything he's been through. Another beautifully written cd. I'm a huge Jaguares fan and I can't wait to see them on tour 9/15!"
2,PLEASE SAUL LEAVE CIUDAD JUAREZ....,"I'M NOT TRYING TO HATE ON THIS BAND, I LOVE THEIR HISTORY BEGINNING FROM CAIFANES ON, HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THAT THEY REFUSE TO GROW MUSICALLY, AT LEAST MANA ARE AWARE OF THEIR STATUS AS POP gODS AND USE IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE, AS WELL AS TAKING OUT ""GOOD"" ALBUMS, JAGUARES, IT'S SAD TO SAY,HAS NOT HAD A STRONG ALBUM SINCE EL EQUILIBRIO DE LOS JAGUARES, I WOULD RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO LA BARRANCA OR MORE RECENTLY TO SAN PASCUALITO REY, OR GREAT ARTISTS CAFE TACUBA, WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN SCARED TO GO INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORIES MUSICALLY, SAUL SHOULD BE LESS INTERESTED IN POLITICS A LA BONO, AND INSTEAD TRY TO SAVE THE WORLD AS HE DID ONCE WRITING GREAT SONGS."
4,Good for the amount of music on the CD,"Jaguares are a great band I can honestly say they are since I have had the luck in seeing them so many times in up to three countries. In full honesty I think the CD could have been better but I know with age and life creeing up on them even the greats dont alawys produce the best. Example(the Cure,DEpechE,Heroes Del SilenCio) so thats why I can say it could have been better but thats not stopping me from catching them IN Las Vegas and New york. Buy the CD and see for yourself. Long time Jagaures,Caifanes fan.Miguel Rios ,Hollywood,CA"
5,The same well-spring as Rumi.,"Robert Rabbin drinks from the same well-spring as Rumi. He is a champion like Ali because his words float like a butterfly and sting like a bee. I love Echoes of Silence. I couldn't wait until the next word, the next phrase because they took me to a place I've always wanted to go, but didn't know how to get there. The book is more than words to be read. It is an experience. I was held gently, and I was shaken, but whether resting in comfort or vibrating with what I had just read, I felt closer to the heart of meditation."
3,needed to think more.,"the author needed to think more about his choice of photos and text before he wrote this book.whil it is a fine book,it is short on the needed photos of the way to move between the static postures shown in the techniques and forms.perhaps yang will consider making the next volume since we have had this one for several years to learn from and would like to continue growing.he goes far more into details of technique in his other books so why doesn't he produce the next chang chuan volume?there are many who learn from books because we cannot afford to move to where the teacher is or there are none in our area.please master yang help us.release vol.2. please.thank you."
1,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I've always been a fan of kung fu and have always found it to be an effective fighting art. But some of the stuff in this book is quite questionable. The pictures are practically useless as all that is shown are flicky kicks that could never harm a tough opponent and useless punches that prolly woldn't have great efeect, that is, even if they hit. The stances shown are laughable. How easy it is to get taken down in one of those stances is ludicrous and the power behind your stances will leave something to be desired. Every stance that is built for speed lacks power and every stance built for power lacks speed. You'll find some useful information in the book and some interesting background, but if it's realistic training you want, I suggest you look elsewhere."
5,pretty good for a book,"This book is certainly an interesting read, and provides very good information about the history of chinese martial arts. It does a beautiful job of describing various useful excersises that are great for any martial artist.On the other hand, it is important that the reader realizes the need for a flesh and blood instructor when learning Kung Fu. When it comes to the Shaolin Long Fist form itself, the book serves as a wonderful source for reference and a helpful tool but only when used to augment the teachings of a real Shi Fu."
4,Better than most,"Yang Jwing Ming has been publishing high quality martial arts books and videos for more than twenty years now, and this early volume, definitely fits into that category as well.It gives a great overview of chang quan, long fist, and as usual with Yangs books, the explanations are clear, concise and satisfying. The pictures are all clear and easy to interpret.I don't think that one can learn martial arts from books, but they can be a good help. Especially when it comes to the understanding of philosophy, history and indeed technique.Highly recommended"
5,Excelent book for beginer and advanced practicioner,"I had a LOT of books from martial arts field, but all of them are zero compared with this one.Very detailed and a lot of pictures.You just need a sparing partner and have no problem lerning from this book"
2,Odd Leadership Voices,"This is an odd book, one that I frankly did not enjoy. Fleming can write, and I'm sure he knows his subject. But his ""unlikely voices"" are indeed that, coming from obscure places and people throughout history and offering what I thought was some pretty off the wall, and consequently, unhelpful advice. If it's your cup of tea, OK, but I would not recommend this book as a great source of leadership advice."
2,A struggle to read.,"Flemming's book is easy to dismiss for it's ethereal approach to modern, or more accurately post-modern, leadership. I found myself feeling angry and frustrated that he was wasting my time as I forced myself through early chapters of this book. Occasionally Flemming wrote something that coincided with my own experience and I was able to compare my own interpretation of this with his. This process was helpful as it critiqued my own ideas and allowed me to refine them. Sometimes Flemming gave voice to something I felt but was unable to articulate and I appreciated the validation this offered to my developing leadership. Finally I appreciated the focus Flemming put on people and relationships while still retaining the value of output. This initiated much reflection about what I focus on in my own leadership."
1,Picture is deceptive,"I am disappointed in that the picture looks different than the actual item. I thought I'd be able to bolt it right on ... but because it's not the same, I now have a big hassle. I have to decide whether to sell it locally or eat a ton on the shipping cost, all because the picture isn't accurate. I imagine the muffler is fine but it's clearly been misrepresented."
1,defective product,The VHS tape you sent ( A Little Night Music) was supposed to be a new tape. The box was old taped with scotch tape AND not rewound. The sound was erratic and the tape would slip. I would like an actual new copy or credit.
2,Keep your VHS.,"This DVD is not good, not that the quality of the original film was all that good, either. Yes, the film has mono sound- it always did. Yes, the picture quality is not good- it never was. This DVD looks like it was put together from a best-available positive print. Both the DVD and the packaging look like fairly well done home-grown bootleg product. Don't ANY original negatives still exist? The worst part of the DVD is that, unlike the VHS, it has been remastered at a slightly accelerated speed, resulting in ALL the music coming out a half tone higher in pitch- MOST disconcerting."
5,A little Night Music DVD,Great DVD of the musical. The original was damaged and I returned it and they sent out a second one. They are great to deal with in that way. The first one took forever to arrive though.
2,a little night music,"I AM RETURNING MY COPY OF ""A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC"". FIRST OF ALL IT STATES ON THE DVD THAT IT IS IN THE WIDESCREEN FORMAT, IT IS NOT, IT IS FULL SCREEN. I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY GOT THIS PRINT BUT THERE IS A BLACK LINE GOING DOWN THE PICTURE FOR ALMOST ALL OF THE FILM. THE SOUND IS BAD AND THERE ARE TWO PLACES WHERE THE A BIG BLACK LINE SHOWING TH AGE OF THE FILM. I TRIED TO FIND OUT WHERE HEN'S TOOTH VIDEO IS LOCATED AND THERE WAS NO WEBSITE FOR THEM. THIS IS AWFUL THAT A FILM OF THE CALUBLAR HAS BEEN LOST. WHERE IS THE MASTER STORED? I AM SURE THAT SOMEONE HAS IT.THEY WERE ABLE TO RESTORE ""MY FAIR LADY"". THIS FILM NEEDS SONE RESTORING BEFORE IT IS LOST FOREVER, OR IT IS TIME TO REDUE IT AGAIN WITH A DIFFERENT CAST."
3,Could Have Been Worse But I Don't Know How,"I saw this in the theater in 1978 after having seen it on stage in its national tour. What a disappointment! When the line ""If she'd only been fat"" was sung, the audience laughed. Liz was pretty plump, and she couldn't sing. She slaughtered ""Send In the Clowns"". Hal Prince elmininated the quintet and all of their wonderful songs. What was he thinking? I did enjoy the rewrite of ""The Glamourous Life"" and some new lyrics for ""Weekend In the Country"". All in all, though, the best part of the evening was when it ended."
2,What a disappointment...,"Like others here have already stated, this DVD is a major disappointment. I've been waiting forever to get this film on DVD so when I started watching it and saw the poor quality and sound of this release, I was very upset. I feel so ripped off! The DVD version doesn't look any better than the old VHS copy I've had for years. If you already have this on VHS, save your money and avoid this DVD."
5,"A Little Scratched, a Little Faded but Still Wonderful.","Maybe one day there will be some billionaire benefactor who appreciates Sondhiem enough to want to truly preserve this gem that was made in a time when musical were no longer being made. When I went in 1977, my father invited me to see it for my 18th birthday. We sat in the theatre alone. Rex Reed compare it to Gigi and he was right. This musical takes an intelligent and humorous look at love. The wit and musical genius of Stephen Sondheim. Those who criticize Liz Taylor being to fat for the role, this is a period piece and for the year that the piece takes place in, Liz would not have been considered fat at all. She would have been thought of as a type of Mae West. It wasn't a time of thin boyish types that didn't happen till the 20's.It is a good film and very watchable. Buy and enjoy."
2,"""CLOWNPLAY""","BASED on Ingmar Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" [according to rumor Sondheim wanted 'Ring Round the Moon' couldn't get permission] - this is the merry mix-up [the musical is lighter than the original movie] of a mis-matched May/December marriage, a semi-suicidal son, a best friend's 'duel-obsessive' husband, a beautiful actress, a young love child .... and an elderly Grand dame who seems to know all!!! ADD a 'week-end' in the Country - and you're there.It's a well-spirited movie, but doesn't quite leave it's mark except for Dame Diana Rigg [""Every Day A Little Death""] as Miss Taylor's Best Friend! Stellar performance. The rest plods.Excellent Art direction and costumes though."
3,Sound Issues with Surround Sound Systems,"The musical is great, although the editing leaves much to be desired. The problem I have with the DVD is that the sound, which played through two different systems that have multiple speaker surround sounds with Dolby Decoding is that there are several scenes that have very annoying background bass that detracts from the scenes. However, when played through two systems that do not have surround sound systems, the terrible bass sound is not present. Both these systems use Dolby decoders as well, but have not separate bass spreaker, so that the bass is not enhanced. I sent back the original DVD thining it was a flaw in the disc; however, the second disc had the identical problem. Otherwise I enjoy this musical and am willing to put up the the minor irritation. Playing it without the surround system is best, if possible on your system."
5,HOT STUFF,"If you know a hotter writer than Penny, then please let all her fans know. But I doubt it. Penny is the best eroticist in print: witty, seductive, stylish - but deeply decadent. And her latest novel is the hottest yet. What I like about her novels is that they portray the inner mindset of the female sub-slut at its most depraved."
1,Maybe fit to be tied is a better title ....,"I really really have to be more carefull when I buy some of these 'wham bang thank you mam' kind of books .... I can't even believe that this is one of a series of Penny books .... WOWI mean this is a book that really gets into from the get go; 'My a... ring gave, the plug popped inside and it had been done.' is the first sentence in the book. This scene starts the description of Penny being starkers with only the mask of a fox and of course a tail (check first sentence) being set free in the woods while a group of male and female hunters would try to hunt down the 'fox' for her goodies ....I guess if you are a closet submissive then parts of this bok would be interesting ....."
4,Way-cool mix of mellow acid jazz,"Bands on this disc:Mother Earth: ""Jesse""""Apple Green""Brand New Heavies: ""Stay This Way""""Put the Funk Back in It""Snowboy: ""Lucky Fellow""""Girl Overboard""James Taylor Quartet: ""Good Thing""The Apostles: ""Mercy Mercy Me""Emperors New Clothes: ""Tears Inside""Night Trains: ""Lonely Road""Corduroy: ""Out of Here""Vibraphonic: ""To Know You is to Love You""Esperanto: ""Sweet Feelings""The Quiet Boys: ""Righteous""Jessica Lauren: ""Couldn't Take the Missing You"""
4,OK book order,"Arrived quickly and in new condition. I wanted a good resource that focused primarily on the service aspects of dining with a little information on dishware/glassware/silverware. This is the opposite-major focus is on the materials with some historical information and lesser focus is on service itself.That said, I think it's a great reference book with lots of detail and the type of information on dining that is not ""all in one place"" in any other source."
5,All what you need to entertain like a Princess,"I loved this book as it contains tons of useful information. You don't need to read it all, if you wish, but, it's worth having it for reference.The Art of the Table helped me in making my mind about the pieces of tableware I should buy considering my ""entertaining"" style and the courses I usually serve to my guests. She is not pretentious or snob and clearly advises you to buy the best quality of tableware you can afford and forget about buying silver, for example, if you simply don't have the budget.I also love the detail. It's the first book of the many I own on table settings that tells me what are the differences between the three possible coffee cups you can buy (coffee, after-dinner coffee and demitasse). Not bad as I live in Italy and Italians are crazy about coffee!!My advice: simply buy it."
3,Cool burst,"I liked this burst. The figure of spiderman is great. I would like to have the spiderman sixpack lol. The figure looks great to put it on a place, just by itself. And also it is a bank. Overall I liked it a lot."
2,The new day must be cloudy,"I got $20 of gift cards for my birthday... Being 26, the first thing I bought was some soap. I had planned to buy myself some socks with the remainder of the money. It occurred to me, however, that I could buy the new David Gray cd ... As a fan of his previous work, I decided to do just that.......I could have had new socks. Gray ones. They would have been more comfortable than a listen to A New Day at Midnight."
3,not as satisfying as white ladder but still a good cd,"there are some real gems on this CD but overall it did not capture my heart like white ladder did...if you like mr. gray's work, you will probably like this cd, but you may feel as i did, just a little let down...the lyrics on this cd are not in my opinion anywhere near the caliber of those on white ladder and...mr. gray's voice and music really aren't strong enough to stand on their own merits..."
3,"Great reviews, but what type of music?","After reading all of the reviews, I still cannot determine (besides the lyrics) what everyone is raving about? It would help the reader of reviews if musical quality & specific instruments were named. More to music than just lyrics. The original CD NOW would list all of the accompanying musicians & instruments played which definitely would sway me towards buying an unknown commodity. Great suggestion for increased reader quality!"
5,A great follow-up,"David Gray has put out a great CD to follow his first hit record 'White Ladder.' The sound is familiar yet, different. The lyrics are again well thought out, clever, and insightful. You will not be disappointed with 'A New Day at Midnight' if you enjoyed his first album."
3,"Decent, but melancholic","Though I have only had the CD for a day, I managed to listen to it its entirety several times yesterday and found myself yearning for more. The album incorporates more of the additional musical elements that so distinguished White Ladder from his previous albums, but where that album succeeded in creating a powerful and enticing sound, I couldn't help but feel that Midnight was a downer and lacked the same power.There are a couple of strong tracks on the album (notably The Other Side) and perhaps in time I will grow more fond of this album, but initial impression was not that strong.If White Ladder was your first David Gray album and you are looking to hear more, I would recommend his older albums such as EPs and Century Ends."
5,"As usual, no complaints about a good thing.","I am a new fan of David Gray, though I have heard his song for several years, January Rain caught my ear with friends the other week and I quickly purchased 3 CDs. I am not disappointed at all. His unique voice has a hint of the style in the late 70s, and with todays accents. He is an accomplished musician and can sing up a storm, with his mellow raspy voice. His songs are a delight to sit back and picture in your mind being seated next to him or playing along. Just a very down to earth style of music. I will buy more of David Gray."
3,Sophmore slump,"Yes, I know that David Gray has been around longer than White Ladder. But that was his break out album and so this is likely to be the next album that most people hear. He employs precisely the same musical style that made White Ladder such a heart breaker. But that album, as everyone knows, was recorded in his rented one room apartment when he was staring into the abyss. The desperation of his lyrics matched the simplicity of his music and the low-fi quality of his recording. I don't think Gray's fans will be tremendously disappointed by this follow on record; but for casual fans, there is nothing on this record with power of Please Forgive Me, My Oh My, or Sail Away, and that's more sad than Gray's music. Completely forgettable."
2,"Alas, all good things must end","I have been a David Gray fan for years, way before White Ladder came out. I have loved every single album that he's done. But this one stinks. The drum machine is overused, the lyrics are mundane, and the music is, overall, boring. I have tried to make myself like it, but all the songs start to blend together in a monotonous drone by track 7 or so, and I just can't get into it. I would have given it only one star, except that there are a couple of songs that are still interesting. Dead in the Water, for example, is solid, and reminiscent of songs off his first release, Century Ends. I don't know what happened, but I'm afraid that my favorite singer/songer might have been unwittingly describing himself in that song.Buy any album of his EXCEPT this one."
3,Pretty grood...,"I only really liked 6 songs on this, and considering there are only 12 anyway, it's not a great amount. They were Dead in the water, Freedom, Real Love, Be mine, Easy way to cry and The Other side. As i said in the title, it's pretty grood (good, but not great) and if you're gonna get a David Grey album, buy White Ladder. Happy shopping!"
3,"Reasonable, but not a patch on 'White Ladder'","I was somewhat disappointed with this album. Whilst every song on 'White Ladder' was excellent, I think that only the final three songs on this album come close. 'The Other Side' is particularly emotive, whilst 'No easy way to cry' is effective in its simplicity. The only jewel of the album, however, lies in 'Be Mine' - his best song so far in my opinion. The music itself is good, though unexceptional, but two lines of lyrics show that David Gray can put into words feelings that most people (myself included) simply aren't able to do.""And everytime i'm talking with you, it's always over too soon,And everyday feels so incomplete until you walk into the room,Say the word now girl,I'll jump that moon....""For anyone who has ever felt that way about anyone they'll know what I mean - for those who haven't, I apologise for the sentimentality.In short, if you enjoyed his earlier album, I think you will be somewhat disappointed with this one."
3,Unplug the synthesizer,"5 stars come easy at Amazon these days, so as to lose significance. But at least it indicates a CD is buyable, as this one is if you are a David Gray collector. It just doesn't seem as inspired and vibrant as his music was when he was still trying to break through. Still, his great songwriting skills shine through.With Amazonian generousity, ""A New Day At Midnight"" could be worthy of 4 stars were it not for the unflattering production. The Electro/synth sound sells trip hop and trance dance music, but it doesn't fare well in the singer/songwriter genre except in the hands of someone like Beth Orton who effectively weaves it into her soundscapes. Here, it is like adding day-glo paint to a Monet. It is distracting, unnecessary, and mars the integrity of the work underneath."
5,"If you like David Gray, check out Steven Delopoulos!","I've always admired the works of David Gray, John Mayer, Pete Yorn, Tracy Chapman, etc. This release is no exception. The songs are touching and sung from the heart. Another great artist that is up and coming is Steven Delopoulos, who is a singer songwriter from New Jersey. His latest release is titled 'Me Died Blue', which is a masterpiece. I caught him and Susan Enan live in Cleveland, and his singing and acoustic guitar songwriting abilities are second to none. He has a unique staccato style guitar style with a voice delivery that will blow you away! It is great to see a major revival in singer/songwriter collaborators like Gray, Yorn, and Delopoulos!"
4,More Gray is Good Gray,"When I first heard White Ladder I heralded David Gray as the new Bob Dylan. I now know the new Bob Dylan is Conor Oberst. Even so, Gray continues to refine his craft, adding new texture and layers of sound to his rock steady craftsmanship. Where White Ladder soared with tales of redemption, A New Day is filled with the pain and sorrow of loss. Written after the death of Gray's father, A New Day finds the singer in a reflective mood, painting for us a picture made up mostly of blacks, blues, and of course, greys. Clune's musical wizadry does seem a little overdone at times, but it's hard to fault his exuberance, especially since he is largely responsible for Gray's resurgence as an artistic force. Look for acoustic versions to follow. Standout tracks: Kangaroo, Easy Way to Cry."
5,Awesome.,"Brutal honesty in this release. As good as White Ladder for sure. I've only listened to it about twice through, but it's really excellent. Dead in the Water and Caroline are dynamite opening tracks, but I feel indifferent to Otherside right now. Usual DG though. Go buy it."
5,Colors are vibrant,The material is very nice and the colors are vibrant. A perfect addition to a kitchen with an Italian theme.
3,Not much new,"If you are a fan of interesting breakfast ideas, look elsewhere. There is one wild mushroom quiche recipe that is very good, but the rest are quite simple and basic. The book assumes you have never made pancakes before."
3,amazon book order,About half the recipes were something I havent seen before there were not many recipes for the price so so book.
1,major disappointment,"I had a much earlier version of calendar creator and was forced to upgrade because of a new microsoft operating system. Sadly, the programmers at Broderbund have not been kind to this program in the meantime. Where it used to be easy to add multiple items to the calendar, it is now a more laborious process. Where it was easy to format printing for standard filofax paper, it's now not. You used to be able to print a very plain, simple format, not tarted up with pictures, fancy layouts, etc. No more, or certainly not easily. Someone should tell software companies that more is not always better!!!"
1,Junk,"This software is horrible. Tried the Smart Download from Broderbund. What a pitiful piece of junk. Their Email consulting is horrible. The software doesn't behave as expected. When I go on-line to give Broderbund feedback, all the feedback links are broken."
1,Dissappointed,"Dissappointed, product does not do what it claims and is difficult to use. Would not recommend."
4,the latest upgrade for Calendar Creator,"bought a new IBM / Lenovo ThinkPad T60, my working perfectly copy of Release 9 Calendar Creator would not load on the XP Pro -- yet it works perfectly on my old T42 with XP Pro!!! IBM of course, pointed to the Calendar Creator 9 as the problem -- this Release 12 loaded and works perfect on my new laptop, much cheaper here at Amazon than from Broderbund direct"
1,Given Up on Calendar Creator Period,"I've been using Calendar Creator Plus since it was released for Windows 3.1. I've tried upgrading three times (v 5, v6, v9); each time, the program failed to perform as well as CC Plus. Tech support is useless; forum is useless. I only need a calendar program which can print out a month-at-a glance on two facing pages. I don't use pictures, or other art work in my calendars. Amazon.com might consider selling CalendarScope which works beautifully for my purposes, but does NOT do picture inserts. It can be purchased to sync with various smart phones as well. Their tech support is prompt and courteous. I debated posting this, but it took me days and days to find this program. I'd given up hope because CC Plus would no longer run inside a 64-bit machine. CalendarScope is a Windows program. It is MUCH easier to use than Calendar Creator in every respect with which I've used it."
3,Calendar Creator,"I purchased the Calendar Creator 12.1 and was pleased with the events section. I was making a 2 page calendar and I found it easy to cut and add pictures to the top page and move them around, add titles and generally work with it. I could even add background color with no problems if the pictures were not cropped. However if the picture was cropped, the picture would have a white square around it. When I changed the white square to match the background, I lost the ability to print the picture. I have sent 3 emails to their support section and have not received any reply. I really liked the rest of the program, and hope that they fix this problem in a newer verson. It would also be nice if they had a better support system."
4,GREAT CALENDAR MAKER,"I had been searching for a replacement for my Calendr Creator program which no longer was usable with either Vista or Windows 7 my two operting systems. This does everything my old one did and much more except for one thing...I used to be able to make two separate calenders. On personal and one business and print them separately but also a combine print out for myself. This program, as far as I have tried it, doesn't allow that. Otherwise the clip art is excelent allowing illustrations for any or all dates as well as lots of type styles and sizes. An excellent tool.AL WAGNER, home and theatre user."
3,Messenger has some great moments but is very flawed,"I was rivited by the first half of this movie. The notification scenes are well done and very moving. The two main characters seem interesting in the beginning, but unfortunately this movie had a meandering and ultimately unintelligent script and the two main characters ended up becoming not much more than charicatures. The direction was also poor -- the director allowed scenes to go on aimlessly, indulging himself and the actors rather than thinking of the story, and the best way to get it told. Part of his problem may have been that the movie just didn't have an ultimate direction, or ultimate reason for being. I'm giving this three stars because the acting was very good in the first half."
4,fear factor,"Captain Tony Stone:""Soldiers go to war and everyone waves flags and applauds. They lookat charts and study strategy and have ""informed opinions"". And thenthe bullets fly and soldiers die and it's such a shock. [BLEEP] that!What did they think it was gonna be like? Fear Factor?""Great acting by Ben Foster and yes, Woody Harrelson. Samantha Morton as well. Woody got lots of love but where's the recognition for Foster?Anyway, compelling drama here about two Army officers assigned the happy task of giving notification to families, or next of kin (nok), that their relative/loved one is dead.Yes it is moving. War is, you know, kind of an emotional thing.Well the the White House and media had people convinced the troops were at least going to be greeted as heroes.Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates give you their condolences."
2,Downer topic low budget going nowhere movie,"Having served in the military I was unsure of how a ""downer topic"" would make for a good story. This low budget movie had a couple of Oscar nominations but the dialogue and banter between the three main characters was limited and spermatic. Both had issues they were dealing with but those issues, I feel, could have been developed with detailed flashbacks before returning to the main slow paced story drifting to nowhere. The wedding rehearsal ruined any sympathy I have for the Sergeant-hero and the Captain's attitude and demeanor caused me to write him off early in the story. Basically a downer movie with a downer topic with limited story and so so acting."
3,"It's an ""Alright"" movie","I purchased this movie on an Amazon review. I had already seen, ""Taking Chance"" and that movie was incredibly touching. On the other hand ""The Messenger"" didn't even come close to it."
2,Would have been a good movie,"This could have been a great movie if it had not been for the offensive language and the nudity. I thought it was about notifying family about the loss of their loved one in a war. That's what it was supposed to be about but because of all the vulgar language and nudity, I couldn't watch it for even 30 minutes. I was so disappointed. I saw one occasion of family notification but the rest of what I saw and heard was vulgar language and nudity. It's too bad that so many movie makers seem to think they have to include such scenes in films in order for them to sell. In my opinion, adding such scenes does not honor our soldiers at all. What a shame."
1,Boring,"It is a 15 minute story stretched into 118 minutes of sheer boredom. So boring that I started skipping through the last half of the movie. Glad I streamed it instead of buying. Definitely goes into my ""never again"" list."
4,Better than expected.,"The Messenger starring Woody Harrleson and Ben Foster is a harrowing and realistic film about two war veterans who form an unlikely bond. Harrleson was nominated for an Oscar for this film, he's the kind of actor that really goes out on a limb with each performance. This is the first film I have seen with Ben Foster and wow what an amazing actor! His raw emotions and facial expressions are both profound and heartbreaking. I really enjoyed this film even though the subject matter is difficult to take here and there."
4,Brutally honest,"""The Messenger"" tells the story of two soldiers whose unenviable job it is to inform deceased soldiers' next of kin that their loved one has been killed. Woody Harrelson, in an Oscar-nominated role, and Ben Foster deliver the performances of their careers as they portray conflicting views of patriotism and service to one's country. Both soldiers are coping with survivor's guilt, and their brutal struggle to make sense of their experiences in battle and in grief is both painful and cathartic. This is a well-written and emotionally honest film that moves slowly in spots, but its unflinching honesty provides redemption. If you overlooked this one in theaters (or if it never made it to your town), catch it on DVD."
3,Delivering bad news with dignity,"Strong performances by Ben Foster, Samantha Morton and Woody Harrelson give this movie the nuance and poignancy that the subject deserves. It could have done with a more crisper edit. At places the gravity of the topic seemed to become a burden rather than an asset."
3,The dog on the roof,"Story was good, some of details were a little too simple, but was a good story.Some of the logic used with a couple of characters was childlike where decisionwas to be made."
1,Where's the Beef?,"It is obvious that Slywotzky is under the gun to be the ""thought leader"" for Mercer Management Consulting now that his firm has been acquired by Mercer. While the profit patterns he refers to are interesting, much is re-hashed case studies from The Profit Zone. As I read chapter after chapter I thought to myself, ""this is very superficial and won't give me what I need to apply the theory to my situation. Slywotzky ends each chapter with a How to Profit? takeaway. At the end of one chapter it reads, ""Invest the time and effort to build a customer profitability system."" Statements like these are vague and frustrating as he does not tell us how to do the things he recommends. A very disappointing follow-up to two very good books. Skip this book and get his others."
4,This book will make you think!,"This is not a book of answers. Nor is it a 'how to' book. It is a book of questions. These questions are intended to challenge you and your ways of doing business. It helps you to spot patterns for 'success' and 'failures' in different business situations by heightening your business awareness. Because the concepts of this book are written at the strategic level (as opposed to tactical level), most of the discussions are focused around general concepts and general trends. Overall, this book should be an invaluable reference guide."
3,Calm Down; it's Not THAT Good,"I don't see why people make such a big deal out of this one. Burn You Down and The Cleansing are pretty good tracks, but the rest are just decent. As for the idiot who was quoted saying that they moved away from thrash and became more technical... that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Stripping down your sound and adding alternative elements isn't technical at all. Fast, complex riffs, drums and difficult solos are technical. Thrash is technical. Not alternative."
4,Collins' detective hero sure gets around,"I always like it when a book is a fast, breezy read, yet still has a lot of meat to it. That's certainly the case here: the stories in this collection are all fast-paced, entertaining mystery thrillers, but these ""tall tales"" are also laced with lots of authentic period description and accurate biographical details about the true-life crime, crime-fighting, or celebrity figures depicted. It was especially interesting to read about Nate Heller's ""true encounter"" with Eliot Ness, where we learn that Ness wasn't quite the white-bread hero depicted in Brian De Palma's admittedly terrific ""The Untouchables"". All in all, a vastly entertaining and informative read."
3,Nice Plate - Slow Delivery,"While I am please with the overall appearance of the license plate, I was not please with the amount of time it took to get it (about a month)."
3,Its ok.,"I found it slightly usefull, i think i carried more than anything. Works well and resonably priced. My kids enjoyed fighting over it."
3,OK,"I bought this DVD on the review of someone else. Maybe it was the timing on my part, because the movie did not grab me right away. I plan to watch it again, but I do not plan to get rid of it."
2,Dry and Boring,"The author does go into great depth with his research, but the writing style is academic, dry, and unengaging.It was difficult for me to get a clear profile of the entrepreneurs profiled in the book because instead of focusing on one at a time, Klein takes one topic (i.e. - childhood), and does a brief synopsis on every single person, before tackling another topic and doing it all over again.The author also seems to waver between trying to establish a relationship, a common thread, between the profiled entrepreneurs, only to state that there is not set pattern or point out abberations.A frustrating read."
2,Non-Standard 6-Pin Connector,"I have an EVGA 7900GS and the 6-pin connector did not match the socket on the video card. It may be possible to modify the 6-pin to fit, but it looks like it will take quite a while to do this without the proper tools. I would recommend that potential buyers check with their video card supplier first, as this may be a non-standard socket on their part. I have yet to find any indication that this is the case, but there is no other reason for a standard connector to not fit."
5,short stories of big tails,"This book is a compilation of great short stories about fishing, from various writers, edited by Edwin Michell. I believe the book was first published in 1946 with reprints in 1948. My old copy is hardcover with dustjacket. The stories in order are:# Big Two-Hearted River - Ernest Hemingway# A Fatal Success - Henry van Dyke# Plain Fishing - Frank R. Stockton# Once on a Sunday - Philip Wylie# Crocker's Hole - R.D. Blackmore# Ol' Settler of Deep Hole - Irving Bacheller# Byme-by-Tarpon - Zane Grey# Trout Fishing - W.C. Prime# A Shark Story - T.C. Haliburton# The Hole - Guy de Maupassant# Old Faithful - John Taintor Foote# Salar the Salmon - Henry Williamson# Pete and the Big Trout - Henry Ward Beecher# It Was on the Allagash - DeWitt Mackenzie# Butterflies and Brown Trout - Compton Mackenzie and Moray McLaren# Trouting Along the Catasauqua - Frank Forester# The Fisherman - Martin Armstrong# Gathering of the Clan - Eugene E. Slocum"
4,Much needed book,"I wasn't to happy about how long it took the book to get to me, but I got it just in time for my class."
4,Depth on a long and winding road,"This is an good book to explore the mechanics of Oracle's implementation of SQL. It has average organization, but you'll have a bumpy read.The exercises are sometimes the only place concepts are addressed. Some information on Oracle is incorrect, like the default date format. The book uses the value prior to Y2K. The 3rd Edition is a patch work of changes and a complete or major overhaul would be helpful. It is not for a beginner in Oracle technology.The book vaguely mentions normalization, the examples are poorly thought out and too shallow to be of any value. If you're studying for the certification exam, this isn't the book you should buy."
3,Good SQL background info,The book is good for background info. In my opinion you cannot learn the language without trying it. I found the book very theoretical.
4,Securitization:Most important financial innovation in 25 yrs,"The Primer offers an introductory read for those wishing to understand the factors that have been driving the securitization process, how it reshaped the financial industry, and the issues it poses for monetary authorities and regulators. The book's uniqueness rests in that the story of the origins of securitization is told by its founders. Lew Ranieri, Larry Fink, Leland Brendsel, Dennis Cantwell, working at Saloman,First Boston, Freddie Mac and Chrysler Financial respectively, along with others, relate both the challenges they faced and the promise they sought in launching the concept. Every effort is made to identify the principles necessary to expand securitization to new products and fields domestically and internationally. Professor Leon Kendall, Kellogg GSM, Northwestern University, Editor."
2,Not worth it,"Interesting concept, but difficult to keep my child level. She likes to do everything herself, so when she climbs up herself, I can't assure that she is well-positioned, and that the beads are equally distributed. If I do manage to position her in the seat, when she moves around, the bean-bag shifts into an uncomfortable slant, which encourages her to want to get down and move about the room. Also, I have had this seat for 2 months now, and it appears to have settled or flattened; i.e. it is much lower than when I purchased it. I wish I had purchased a different kind of booster seat."
4,Enjoy the exercises,"I got this book to supplement my Tracy Anderson workout. I like it that it concentrates in doing lots of repetitions with light weights. To be honest, I haven't read much of the written content, but I like the pictures and details of the workouts. I feel the results of the exercises, and I got this book used so it was very cheap."
4,"Cardio Barre, the book","This is a great book to get you motivated to start the Cardio Barre program. I have been working out for quite awhile, but I am short and would like longer looking muscles, which is what you will get when you do this workout and smart eating program consistently. It forces you to think about using your muscles, especially your core; your posture improves, you feel it in places where you never felt it before. I really like it. It is a little difficult to follow the exercises in the book; it ends up taking longer than the book suggests in the beginning. I will probably purchase the videos that accompany it as well, but you can only get them through the official site. Overall, I would recommend it."
4,"Great exercises, wish there was a dvd","I really liked the exercises in this book. They do work your body and if you were dedicated with the program, adding in some cardio, you could see results. I thought the nutrition part was straight forward and sensible too.I gave it four stars because I think it would be awesome if it had a dvd. It wasnt easy to follow along flipping through a book while trying to stay completely focused on your workout. All around good program- but you have to remember the girl on the front of the book probably dances(aerobically) 1-2 hrs a day. You almost need the strength moves as a dvd along with an aerobic dance inspired work out dvd."
5,Great program,It's a very easy book to read and seems like a straightforward plan. I can't wait to start the DVDs.
4,Connie Francis,"A boring collection of songs that have been released many times before on CD and in much better sound quality than presented here. Songs consist of 4 tracks taken from her LP ""The Exciting Connie Francis"": Rock A Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody/Time After Time/The Song Is Ended/Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me and the remaining 8 songs are hits: Among My Souvenirs/Second Hand Love/My Happiness/Frankie/Everybody's Somebody's Fool/My Heart Has A Mind Of Its Own/Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart/Follow The Boys. Unless you are a diehard fan that can use it for the excellent reproduction of the rare photo used on the cover sleeve which is only reason I'm giving this 4 stars, forget it."
4,NonnieS,I received this item as expected. I have been looking for a hardbound copy of this book for a while. There are no reasons I would not order from this vendor again.
4,Good Starter,"This is a great primer for any of the kicking-hitting martial arts. Not too deep or technical yet it covers all the fighting basics (except grappling). We use it for tune-ups for when we are not in the dojo and for settling disagreements as to form and technique options. The way it is laid out, it serves as a great starter or supplement to the fight science student."
3,Mediocre Introduction,The techniques presented in Christopher Delp's book are correct and explained in a way that a beginner can easily understand but the presentation is boring and uninspiring. One can learn all the techniques presented in the book in a two hour class and have a better grasp on the biophysics. There are no interesting or creative moves that a reader can see in the book and then practice on his own. The book works as a reference and probably if one is teaching oneself Muay Thai. However as a supplement to a class on Muay Thai the book is next to worthless.
4,Good book for beginners,"I just want to say this book is good for next descriptions:PRO* The quality of the paper is excellent.* The pictures inside are made it by professionals.* The author and the rest of the crew are really professional fighters training in Thailand.* The techniques are real for using in a Muay Thai fighing.BAD*Is just for beginners and medium fighters.If you have a lot of experience in Muay Thai this book maybe will be boring for learn something new.A real ""must have"" JUST for beginners and medium fighters."
1,What a joke,"Folks, Monster is a brand synonymous with hype over substance and ridiculous pricing. AA batteries, dear friends. Not High Capacity PowerCells. The name of this product, like just about all of the garbage that Monster has been cranking out for years, makes my stomach turn."
4,Pooky Clip,My son loves Garfield and this Pooky clip can go on his backpack and go to school with him.
5,Classic teddy bear in a portable package,"We've all read the Sunday comics, and we all know Garfield's favorite stuffed teddy bear, Pooky. I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday (sans the name 'Pookie' that's what I call her) and she loved it. It has a little clip keyring so you can attach it to your purse, car rearview mirror, or whatever else your heart desires!"
3,Fair performance,"Not a bad unit at all. Narrow field of vision, picture quality is good, night time images are fair. The mounting bracket is disturbingly poor. I don't know what they were thinking when they paired that bracket with this camera."
4,Not for Dreamweaver MX 2004,"I am finding this book helpful, except I am using Dreamweaver MX 2004 and this book is apparently for the previous version. Enough has changed that it is frustrating trying to figure out where things have moved to. I have to pull up the help screen to compare how the book says to do it with how you actually do it in the updated version. Use caution when using this book for the 2004 software. Otherwise, I personally like the pictures--being a visual learner."
2,Explanations a little lacking,"This book is definitely geared towards beginners, but at the same time I found a lot of the explanations a little lacking. The book will walk you through steps but not explain ""why"" you're doing those steps. It seems to me the authors spent to much money on printing in color and not enough on writing a well thoughtout book."
1,It must of been family,"I don't know how anyone could rate this book highly. It was loaded with errors and unexplained situations. I can usually count on Amazon's reviews/ratings before I purchase an item, but this time I was really let down. I bought the book and it is far from perfect. It made me wonder if the previous raters were all family members. Oh well, don't buy....not unless you are into pictures only and not substance."
1,bad product,"I am so disspointed. The kettle heats water great, BUT the automatic shut off doesn't work at all, when it just have been used for several month. I do not recommend getting this model."
1,Do not buy this item,"The base and kettle were not aligned, so the only way I could get the kettle to work was to pad the space in between, which probably wasn't a very safe move.What a piece of crap. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"Strong plastic odor, even after multiple boils","Hard to get rid off plastic odor. Manual suggest boiling and dumping water several times. Did that, and still there is a strong odor. I had a Melita boiler, more expensive, but it was worth every penny."
1,HEATING ELEMENT IS NOT CONCEALED,"I WISH I HAD READ SOME OF THESE REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS. LUCKILY I WON'T USE IT MUCH SO IT MIGHT LAST A WHILE, BUT I WILL NEVER PURCHASE THIS BRAND AGAIN. FIRST OF ALL, THE HEATING ELEMENT IS NOT CONCEALED, IT IS SITTING RIGHT THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POT READY TO GET FULL OF CALCIUM DEPOSITS. THE ONLY REASON I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER ONE WAS BECAUSE THE ONE I LOVED WAS DESTROYED IN A HOUSE FIRE. I WILL TRY TO FIND MY OLD ONE ONLINE SOMEWHERE AND BUY THAT."
1,"SAFETY HAZARD! lasts a few months, then smokes and shorts out","SAFETY HAZARD!!! I've had this product for a few months, maybe close to a year. It worked fine for that time but then I began to notice burning smells and now smoke. Last time I used it, I could tell the plastic was definitely burning. Clearly, the thermostat or whatever it is that causes the heater to turn off does not work. I have to throw the stupid thing away. Its one thing if a product doesn't last long--thats bad enough--but this product is clearly DANGEROUS."
2,"Smells, never drink a drop of water from it~~~","it came with freaking strong smells of plastic, tried every way to remove it, but never made it.maybe you think you are much more lucky than me, but that was what i got.even from the tea brew by this kettle, you can taste the plastic ~~~ don't wanna recall that taste at all~~~throw away, don't even wanna waste time returning"
1,"Don't buy this kettle, it doesn't shut off, it is a hazard","We purchased this kettle only two months ago and it already has boiled dry, which is a huge safety issue. Even when it does shut off, it has been boiling for 10 minutes. It also makes the water taste and smell like plastic when it heats it up. We won't be using it anymore, it's just too dangerous to use when you can't leave the kitchen while your heating water."
1,"West Bend 53783 1-3/4-Quart Cordless Water Kettle, Black","In the picture, it looks great. In reality - a typical low-quality item. After boiling, water acquires some funny flavor. It did not happen with the previous brand we had.Now, when the kettle is full, it stands firm on its heating platform. As soon as the water level reaches 1/2 or lower, the kettle gets too light to stand straight on the platform, because the clamp seems to be tight that it pushes the kettle out of the platform and the kettle tilts forward and has no contact with the clamp to continue boiling water. To avoid that I placed a toy chip under the kettle. I think this model is just underdesigned and underengineered. I will never buy it again. Do not recommend to anyone who values quality."
1,cheaply made,"I ordered this cordless water kettle because it comes in black - however it does not have a solid feeling and is not as well-designed as say, a Proctor-Silex. I will use it but wish I had kept searching. Cordless water kettles in general are surprisingly useful. Pass on this one."
2,Meh! There's more than one way to heat water.,"I suspect I am being a bit harsh on this poor water kettle. For it's price, it does what it says it will do- boil water. I study tea brewing with a Tea Master and so I am constantly trying different kettles. This is the worst one I own. It is clunky, inelegant, the filter is balky, and the way the pitcher fits onto the base is not very good.I suppose if this is all the money you have to spend--no, wait, looking further, if you can just dig up another $5 or $10, you can get something a lot better. If you do buy this, run hot water through it lots of times, and I mean ""lots"" to get most of that plastic taste out of the water. For my money, though, I prefer stainless steel."
1,"Worked once, turned on by itself. A fire hazard",I followed the directions washed the kettle several times before using and had no problems with off taste or odor. I was very pleased with the kettle the first time I used it.The next day I found it had turned itself on without any water in it. It was fine the day before.I turned it off and waited several hours for it to cool and then tried to use it again. It no longer worked.I sent it back. More made in China garbage. WestBend used to mean quality.
3,Does what it promises... But...,"West Bend is as good as any standard electric kettle. However, it is very slow to boil the water."
2,not good,I purchased this kettle as I wanted a concealed heating element-- this did not have a concealed heating element. I returned it.
5,electric tea kettle,"West Bend 53783 1-3/4-Quart Cordless Water Kettle, Blackawesome, heats water fast, easy to clean, lightweight"
5,simly great,"It is light, and one can heat quickly very little or a large quantity of water. I love it. After a visit with my son who had this kettle I came home and purchased one right away."
2,I had better ones,"The good thing: it looks really good, and it brings water to boil.The bad things: it takes a while until the water boils (my old needed nearly half of the time)and the heating element doesn't turn off all the time (it works 8 of 10 times)I think this is an serious issue..."
1,unimpressed,I bought this model because of another review and was completely disappointed. It overheated and broke in 4 months.
1,Not good enough,"You usually get what you pay for. The auto shut-off doesn't work half the time, and my hard water means the element is quickly encrusted with lime scale. Handy, but not safe. I need to get one without an exposed element. The mineral deposit is too difficult to remove from coils at the bottom of this, and it puts particles into and clouds the water. Vicious cycle. Good only for emergency wash water when the water heater is down."
1,Not safe!!!,"When you remove the kettle from the base you need not to forget to switch it off (while other kettles which we had before had an automatic switch off option). in case you forget to do this and you put the empty kettle back, the base heats the empty kettle!! It happened with me, so that the empty kettle worked the whole night. It raised my last electricity bill! It fails to shut off quite frequently!!! It is really dangerous. I do not recommend this kettle at all!"
1,Very unhappy,This pitcher worked about 3 days and on the evening I had company and had to use it it would work. I you applied pressure and held it a certain way it would work but that iss unexceptable.
2,not what i expected,"First, i could not attach filter :) so, i am still using one without it. Second - i already saw it in reviews - the kettle does not automatically turn off as stated in description. THird - i think this is the reason of #2 - the top part does not cover the kettle completely - it really is cheap and not fitted well. and finally, the water tastes pretty strange when boiled in here, some annoying metallic tint always present.Overall - i would not recommend this product. Only to somebody whose hobby is collecting kettles. Disappointed..."
1,Dangerous to health,"Minor issues:1. Auto shut-off not so automatic. Therefore, we had to watch it and manually shut it off when it started boiling.2. Filter is difficult to fit in.Major Issue:After a few months, SMELL OF BURNING RUBBER FROM INSIDE the kettle became the norm. As it turns out, the metal that heats the water touches rubber and emits a caustic stench during boiling. Needless to say, the water and kettle smells real bad - rendering it undrinkable.Avoid. Get something else."
1,Doesn't shut off,"I was recently traveling in New Zealand and every where you went (hotels, RV's, etc) had an electric water kettle. This was great and I really appreciated the automatic shut off, because my boyfriend keeps burning up our tea kettles. So I saw this one, read the reviews and decided to get it. I am so disspointed. The kettle heats water great, BUT the automatic shut off doesn't work at all. This is something that a few other reviews mentioned, so I am sending it back. I do not recommend getting this model."
3,Not Good for Small Amounts of Water,"This unit is OK if you want to heat more than two cups of water. It has a minimum water level to cover the coils. If you want to just heat 1/2 cup for oat meal or one cup for a tea, you waste a lot of electricity and water by heating two cups. If you use bottled water like I do, you really don't want to waste half or more of the water you are heating up. Don't leave the water in the kettle either. It will leak. It also does not shut itself off as advertized after the water is heated to boiling. It will keep on boiling until you shut if off or if it goes dry. It is also very cheaply made, but I guess what to you want for $20."
1,Buyer Beware!!! Dangerous Item!!,"Well, I've owned this tea pot for about 6 months now. It seemed to work fine until 2 nights ago. I used it, set the pot back in its holder and walked away for the night. The next day, I noticed moisture all over the front of my new custom cabinets and in fact one of the door's laminate finish had curled up. The tea pot NEVER shut itself off which is supposed to be one of its safety features. Not only is it supposed to shut itself off after it reaches a certain temperature, it most certainly should have after its use. I am grateful that our home did not burn down with us in it but would not want this to happen to others'. Ours was promptly thrown away!! There's a reason the price is too good to be true. Also, it was very bulky and the heating elements are on the inside."
1,Flawed item,"1) Died in less than a year2) The ""filter element"" which fits inside the spout is very hard to keep in place. Not only are there no directions on how to put it in place, it's not even mentioned in the instructions. If it's not put in precisely right, the auto-shut-off feature will not work, and you can easily start a kitchen (dorm room, office) fire. And I do mean easily."
3,Great until it stopped working properly,"I bought this for my grandparents because they drink tea everyday, and I didn't want them to forget about a pot of boiling water on the stove as they are getting older. They loved it when I gave it to them. I bought it December 2nd, and I just found out today that it has stopped turning off automatically when the water is done boiling; it only last 2 months. I might have to suggest getting a one that's a little more expensive."
1,Poor quality control of returned item.,"West Bend 53783 1-3/4-Quart Cordless Water Kettle, BlackThe Kettle looked as if oppened. When used it did not boil but heated a small amount then turned off. It looked to me it was a returned item and was put back on shelf. I have not returned item. I did not want to see the cycle restared but be sure I will never buy another."
2,Wobbly on cradle,"Excited about getting this bargain. Loved that it was a large capacity kettle and cordless, set it up but as soon as I filled it and sat it on it's cradle stand it didn't sit flush on the base and wobbled from left to right in it's cradle. Hence it wouldn't switch on as wouldn't connect. Geeez. I cleverly cut a small piece of cardboard out which I put in the cradle base to help it level it and it worked but it often goes on and off and often never boils fully. I am so mad, it was a bargain at $20 but it's such a hassle and cost to return, isn't it?Will most probably have to go back to tried and tested Krups which I have used prior but they are 3 x times cost. Also they have a three prong connector and I had to move it to a different countertop so I could plug it in.Yuk!"
1,Westnend electric tea pot,"We bought this two weeks ago from amazon and just noticed the paint on the coils already flaking off into the water.The coils are directly exposed in the water you drink and now the trick will be to see since it is manufactured in China,is there any led we have been exposed to. I do not recommend this piece of junk to anyone. Shame on Amazon forselling something as dangerous as this!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"It's inexpensive for a reason - very poor quality and looks very cheap.The kettle stopped working on the second use - it won't turn off.Do yourself a favor, pay some extra dollars and buy a better-quality kettle."
1,this thing is not worth the price,"the water kettle is the worsth thing i've ever seen. With the same price, I could by something better and save my trip for returing it in the end.it wabbles when you are boiling water and the kettle has really strong plastic smells. Not only the appearance is not good, it is not functioning very well either."
3,Funny Little Kettle!,"I love the idea of the electric kettle (and why many of them aren't sold in the U.S. is beyond me). I've been thru two of these West Bend kettles and like how much they hold, and the price was right. The down side: the cord is so stiff and thick. It is a durable cord though. The other downside is that both of mine have had switch problems. They either don't click off or they randomly go back on if ithe kettle is left setting on the stand. Next time I purchase an electric kettle (which has become a necessity in my home) I will probably try a better brand and get a higher quality one. (I noticed in some of the other reviews, they also stated that the automatic shut off didn't work on their kettle either). The price is right if this is your first kettle, and you want to see if you will like it. (To use mine safely since the switch is malfunctioning, for now, I just stay nearby when I turn it on, and when it is not in use, I take it off the base)."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the West Bend 53783 Cordless Water Kettle 12 months ago. For the first month the automatic shut-off worked, but after that first 30 days it hasn't worked since. If I don't catch it the kettle boils dry. My intention was to purchase this for my son's dorm room, but having used it myself for a few months I opted to purchase a different brand for him. The kettle looks great, I love that you can remove the kettle from the base to fill or pour and do not have a pesty cord dangling. However, the safety issue is a big pitfall of this product. I would not recommend purchasing this."
1,"2ND Purchase, faulty after 6 months","Bought this product a few years ago and it was great till the jug broke this year. Liked it so much I ordered another one.New one did not sit safely still on base and you had to hold it on to boil.Amazons return system is EXCELLENT and a replacement kettle was at my door next day.HOWEVER, the new one while it actually works is STILL wobbly on the base.Dont think I'll buy another one of these once this one breaks.UPDATE as of 9/25New one is already faulty. connection loose and is VERY tempramental when trying to turn on. Im DONE!Purchase at your own risk but PLEASE keep the box etc for at least 6 months.Am buying a completely different kettle and trashing this model."
2,There's a reason why this is $20,"I've had this for less than a week and I'm returning it. Too soon to comment on whether the unit will hold up, but it's very flimsy. The base is too light, so when you pick up the kettle the base often comes with it.Also, the cord uses a 3rd grounding pin-which makes the cord very thick, inflexible, and hard to stick into the channel in the base, to allow the base to lie flat on the counter. My previous kettle, a Krups model that started to leak after 7 years, used a simpler 2-prong plug, which made the cord more flexible.I picked up a new Braun kettle today to replace this one. You can get it on Amazon for what I paid for it--$43; the extra $20 or so appears to be worth it in terms of sturdiness and quality."
2,It heats water but ...,It looks better in the picture than in person. The removable antiscale screen is a joke; I can not even get it to stay in the appliance. The thing heats water though. I have only had it for a couple of days. I would try something else next time.
2,Disappointed in the lack of a real concealed heating element,"I was looking for an electric cordless water kettle with a conceal heating element. Amazon advertised this one having a concealed heating element.So, I bought it.To my surprise it had a revealed heating element.I now doubted myself to think a concealed heating element means something else than what it's words imply."
4,odor biggest problem,"I purchase this item on september, I boil with by it at least 15 times to remove the odor inside, I rinse it after every I boil it, odor still exists but better than first time boiling. I think the odor coming from the plastic body and cap,so I highly suggest to clean the cap every time you boil it, even the odor from the body is almost removed, the odor from cap still show up. Right now I have used it for three months and hard to smell the odor. BTW, the filter is just a thin plastic film only under the mouth and you would not expect it can clean the water so much."
2,Hmmmm boils water....but,I only gave this 2 stars because the filter keeps falling off and without it securely in place and the lid shut just right it doesn't turn off!!
4,About the Auto-shutoff,"I too, after the second day had problems with the Auto-shutoff feature not working (as mentioned in other reviews). I found out that if the lid is not completly closed, the auto-shutoff feature will not work. When the lid is closed properly (you should hear a click when closing the lid. Also, when the water begins to boil, very minimal steam should be seen) The auto shut-off feature will work everytime. The manual does not reference this, but I noticed other cordless water kettle manufacturers will note this in their manuals.I would give it 5 stars, but I was hoping it would boil water a little faster, but for the price I paid, it's more then acceptable"
2,You get what you pay for!,"As an englishman living here in the states, I must have my tea.I, as well as several others it appears are having the same problem with the auto shut off. It worked fine until two weeks ago (kettle is about 4 months old) and it continued to boil long after it should have shut off. Today while I was watching tv it just turned itself on and began boiling. DO NOT BUY!!!"
3,Works but...,"Pros: quick boil, easy to use, large capacityCons: auto shut off stopped working after 4 days"
2,I can't recommend this one.,"Although this is an inexpensive electric, auto-shut-off water kettle, I can't recommend it for one reason: it's not as safe as you might think. The kettle only shuts off automatically if the lid is shut completely, and I mean COMPLETELY. It has to actually snap into place before the auto-shut-off feature will work. And even if you think it's closed all the way, it may not be and it won't shut off automatically. For this reason alone, I can't recommend it."
1,Not pleased,"This unit is as bad as all the reviews indicated. Sorry, I doubted the ratings on this product before purchase. It definitely does have a strong plastic taste and the shut-off is a great safety hazard --- will not shut off!!!! Returned within 24 hours. Would not have given a single star rating but this is the lowest that is allowed."
2,unreliable,"I had the same problem as many users, the kettle wouldn't turn off when the water started to boil. I have thrown mine out."
1,Six months and it's trash!,I purchased this kettle in May. Six months later the switch for auto shut-off stopped working. This is dangerous because now I have to stay in the kitchen to shut it off. I agree with another reviewer-I'll buy better next time.
2,Loved it - while it lasted,"This kettle was fantastic until today. We've had it for about 4 months (used it every day) and today it began to smell like something was burning. We emptied it out and the inside smells like an electrical fire. This could have been a tragedy. They ought to recall these things. I hope the manufacturer will give me a refund, but I am not too hopeful."
1,Do Not Buy This Kettle,"Do Not Buy This Kettle if you like to drink hot tea and water. You will NEVER get the taste of the plastic out. I have boiled mine out a couple of times with vinegar, which helps, but that blasted taste of plastic keeps comming back (and its' nasty). It makes the tea taste like something drained from an industrial waste site.Besides some problems with the electrical connection with the base, this kettle does boil water like crazy. This would be OK for some industrial reason; like you want some hot water to clean engine parts. If you want hot water for consumtion; DO NOT BUY A PLASIC KETTLE. Also, I would be VERY concerened about the health effects of these nasty chemicals.Spend the money, and get yourself a kettle made of stainless steel (about 40 bucks)"
2,Disappointed,"The kettle is constantly on in our house for tea, so an electric kettle is a must! We have been through a number of electric kettles over the years (most stop working properly after the warranty period, but we use ours many, many times during the day, so we get good wear out of them.)We loved the sleek look of this kettle, but ended up disappointed.We had the kettle for 10 days, and after 5 days, it stopped turning off automatically. It also had a very strong plastic smell, which flavored the water. We tried many things to get rid of the smell, but it still has a slight after-taste and smell. Sadly, it has not performed as expected and we will be returning it and ordering another brand."
2,Great for 6 months use,I loved this kettle but must have overused it because it justquit on me after 6 months.
2,Broke after 2 months of use,"I received this tea kettle in February and it worked great. However, after 3 months of use, the heating element inside the kettle separated from the housing, allowing water to pour out onto the electrical connections. Luckily, this happened when the unit was not plugged in, otherwise the results may have been worse than a useless tea kettle.It may have been a defective unit, but I would not recommend this unit. West Bend offered to repair it if I sent it back at my expense. Considering the cost to ship it back and the time it takes, I decided against it and will buy a different brand."
2,boils water - but not reliable,nice kettle. looks cool.build quality is questionable - the on-off switch stopped working within a few weeks...
2,Poor Design,"the kettle automatically shuts off before the water boils - I found that putting a spoon between the front of the kettle and the heating platform allows the kettle to get to the proper temperature. This makes the kettle's performance acceptable, although it is not what I would call a quality product"
1,This is NOT a good pot,"Hate this pot, it takes forever to shut off even when boiling. Would not recommend it."

5,"Great Ornament, Great Christmas Gift","I am very pleased with this item. Not only is this a great ornament but it's a great Christmas gift as well! The ornament was exactly what I thought it would be, and it arrived very quickly. I got it as a Christmas gift for my sister ... she loves Willow Tree figurines. Out of all the Willow Tree ornaments I bought for her, this one is my favorite. I would recommend this item and this seller."
2,Not much here,Saltwater section hard to understand with little instruction. More of a tourist video than anything useful for developing technique.
4,Anderson Silva is bored,"SPOILERSNo disrespect to Patrick Cote, I think he does stand a chance against Silva and could possibly beat him, but Silva seems to be bored with his reign. This is because he is head and shoulders above most other MWs. It is almost time for him to consider taking a few fights at LHW to see how he fairs there. Koscheck and Alves engage in an epic WW war that is pretty much a battle for a title shot. Maynard, while possessing many skills, always seems to play his fights safe and goes for the decision win, not really trying to finish. There is a shocking upset on this card and a few other great battles."
2,"Sinpler Living, Compassionate Living",We are reading this book for Lenten study. I am through the 1st 4 weeks of study and am not enjoying the book. I feel I've read all of this years ago and not that interested in rehashing. I will complete the book but don't look forward to it.
3,Book not so simple to read,"I had a hard time reading this book and gave up after only a few chapters. After the first 2 chapters, I wondered if the author was only going to keep telling me all that was wrong with society. Once I decided to stop reading, my life became much simpler."
5,A humanist classic,"A brilliant investigation into and meditation on the intersection of epidemiology, journalism, politics, and human suffering known as the Gulf War Syndrome. The book is sui generis, and as with many works of surpassing originality it may be overlooked today, but I predict people will be reading this humanist classic in a hundred years."
4,Easy to read and understand and achieve!,"I am a true fan of the Princton Review series of books. But after reading 5 differnt books now, I can tell that some of my understanding comes from how the author lays out the book. Paul Foglino was an author that I had never read before, but after reading the introduction I felt like I could easily read Paul's explainations just like he was a teacher talking to me, not a book talking at me. I was able to read through the whole thing in 2 days before the test (not-recommended). And at the end I had a knowlage of Chemistry like I had never felt before. Good luck to everyone taking the test!"
4,Great Test Tips and Lots of EXPLAINED Practice Problems,"This book is not heavy in simple methodology. If you're looking for that, Buy the Barron's AP Chem book. But this book has great test taking tips at the start of the book. It also has many practice problems, with EACH PROBLEM explained in detail. This includes multiple choice, FRQ, and essay questions. This book is a great buy."
1,too small!,Don't get this unless you have teeny tiny pills. my vitamin d pill and evening primrose pill barely fit in there p. And that was with some shoving.
1,...you americans are so so lucky that this isn't popular in your country...,...you know what bothers me the most? People call this indie when it is obviously Brit Pop...there's no other way to describe it...songs about a guy stalking his girlfriend around town; not being sorry about something or other and that he's not romantic and he likes what he chooses to like (yes...what ever you say Mr. Curlyhead) they really are nothing new and are reliant on big choruses about how he wants to go out with a 17 year old at the age of 24...basic guitars with meek attempts at Brit poppy solos which all end badly......this isn't my type of music at all and that's why I'm so critical of it...so yes if you think I am biased then that is because I am...this is mainstream drivel for people who walk around covered head to toe in topshop...don't...please?
3,Could have been better!!!,"This book was just yout typical urban romance read,with a predictable happily ever after ending.No shock value what so ever.I agree with some other reviewers when they say that the story line was all over the place.Thank God I read some of her recent novels first."
5,The Title Says It All,This is one the first urban romance books I've read. I read this one a few years ago but had to write a review when I seen it. I loved Meesa and Black's story. This was a real quick read with lots of ups and downs. I read it in 2 days and have read it twice already but definately will be reading this one again when I get some free time
4,This was a good book but................................................,This was good book but I thought it could have been a little longer. I hope there will be a part 2 because I would love to see what happens next.....
2,idk,Wasn't worth $7. Went by too fast and became boring to me. Keisha I wanted a better story from you. Hope you don't let me down when material girl 3 comes out
4,Loved It,It was real! It kept me reading and interested the whole time! I will be letting my friends know about this book!
3,A Urban love story,"I will not tell the story like I see in a lot of other reviews. I enjoyed reading ""Me and My Boyfriend"". I read this book in 1 day. I'm gald that I did not purchased this book, because of the typos throughout the book. And that's way I only gave 3 stars. Story line I would give 10 stars. All in all, I think Keisha Ervin did a great job putting her thoughts on paper. Can't wait to read her next book."
4,Great Book,"This book was realllllly good, it had a few typos thats why i didint give it a 5 star but I finished this book in 2 days. Mesa is my girk and I love black becuz he was down for her but he was twisted up and it finally came around..thank god.. but I love this book!! You should read it especially if you are in a realtionship and you date a drug dealer (lol)"
4,STL represently,Don't you just love a book that based on where you are from? I knew every location the author spoke of. Matter of fact Florissant Valley College is across the highway from me. Sprulls is definitely off the chain. This book had my attention all the bragging on what the characters wore and how much they spent got kind of old. But I definitely read it form beginning to end.
3,Hood Love..,"This was a nice lil book. The characters were realistic and I liked the plot. It kept me interested. Im glad things worked out in the end, definitely wouldnt stop anyone from buying it."
4,Great Read!!,I think Triple Crown Publishing needs a new editor. They messed this book up so bad it is a shame. The overall book is great if you can look passed the chapters being placed in the wrong order and numerous editing problems it is a great book!
4,"Interesting, if nothing else","Keisha Ervin has great ideas when it comes to writing books; she is just all over the place with the structure of the book. But in the end, it all comes together and makes a very good story. It is well worth reading."
5,Do you want her Or me ?,"This is the 2nd book of Ms. Ervin that I have read, and I must say that this one and Mina's Joint were both good reads. This book reflects Meesa and Black who has fallen madly in love with each other. Only problem is Meesa is more serious into the relationship and Black is in the streets and can't committ to a one on one relationship right now. As much as he wants to be with her and realizes she's the best thing for him, he's so afraid he will turn out like his father, and he don't want that to happen. Meesa on the other hand wants to settle down and be the one and only. Their relationship is put through the test but as the saying goes "" if you love something set it free, if it's yours it will return"" Or Will It?"
4,Was It Just Me...,"I love Keisha Ervin's books, she's very talented. That being said a little more time should have went to editing. Maybe it's just my copy, but it seems as if some of the chapters got out of order. Everytime I read it, it confuses me. In order for it to make sence, I would have to finish one chapeter, skip the next, then go back to it when I read the one after that. I don't blame Ms. Ervin because that isn't her job, it's the publishers."
3,HOOD,I THIN THE BOOK WAS GOOD..BUT WHY IS THE BOOK SO SHORT..WITH NO ENDING THAT MAKES YOU WANNA SAYGIRL THAT WAS GOOD IT WAS IIGHT
5,Keisha Ervin is my new favorite,Over the last few months I've become hooked on Keisha Ervin's books. She is a great author and her books are all page turners. Each book is filled with love that every girl whether from the hood or in the suburbs yerns for. Love it Love it love it!!!!!! Sorry if this review doesnt give you and details of the book. I just dont want to give out anything to spoil the book for the next reader. Just trust when i say that Keisha Ervin is here to stay!!!
4,An Okay Read....,"I was real surprised by the ending. I thought it would end a different way. I was happy with the ending. The overall book however was just okay. Not bad, but nothing to write home and tell Mama about either. Still, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fast and easy read."
4,Do yo Thing,"This book was off the chain, Keisha needs to receive much more credit than she has. If you haven't read ME and My Boyfriend you need to go snach it real quick. The typos are not Keisha's fault, blame the proof reader! Like Keisha said (Haters) Picture her rolling!"
3,OK NOVEL,"OK WELL THE BOOK WAS GOOD,BUT NOT THE BEST, AM STARTING TO THINK T.C.P IS JUST PUTTING OUT ANY BOOK THATS A STREET NOVEL.I READ ALL THE T.C.P BOOKS BUT THIS ONE HAD TO MANY TYPOS.AND SHE DIDNT HAVE HER DATES RIGHT,SHE WAS 19, THEN 20 AND 22 ALL IN THE MATTER OF THIS SHORT BOOK,WHILE HER SON SEEM TO BE FIVE MONTHS FOREVER.I DO THINK THIS BOOK WAS OK BUT!PREDICABLE.IF YOU ARE A TRUE T.C.P FAN YOU SHOULD READ IT,BUT! DONT GET YOUR HOPES UP,LATELY THEY ALL SEEM TO BE THE SAME."
2,Stop playing keisha,This book was okay. The typos were horrible. The plot kept changing her age kept changing sometimes I thought I was reading two or three different books. She met a guy named Mike in an earlier chapter then met him all over again in another. Black hit her in one chapter then three or four chapters later they go back to the morning after he hit her. This book made me want to take the binding off and resequence the book. I am very upset with triple crown for throwing this mess together without proper revisions.
3,Ms. Average,I would rate this book as being average.The book was pretty good but I don't think messa's character should have been so weak.
4,All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend...,"This book was really good. I read it in like five hours, I couldn't put it down. Messa was a good woman and Black was a good man who didn't know it. He was so afraid of being his father that he wouldn't let himself love Messa the way he really wanted to. They endured alot together. She was alot stronger than what I thought she would be. This was overall a really good book although I thought it could have been longer."
4,All I Need.........,"This was a good book. The story is about a beautiful girl name Meesa, she had her life all figured out, that is until she finally gets the one thing in life she's wanted for so long, Black. During their relationship these two go through a bunch of ups and downs, that test their love and relationship. Will their love be enough to substain the obstacles they go through. It was a really good book, that held my attention. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it was a short book."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent addition to any keychain. Its feels great in your hand, and gives off a nice bright, white light. Perfect for dark nights to illuminate a keyhole, find a dropped item, or even act as a tiny flashlight in a dark alley."
3,Not the brightest that I have compared.,"OK I think this is a fun pocket toy but for what its intended, not the best I have found.Side by side ""Duracell LED Flashlight with Carabiner Clip"" is a lot brighter.I have one more coming to test it against as well so I may do an update to this review too.The ones that don't measure up will make fun little gifts :b"
5,HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION IS KNOCKOUT,A fascinating insight into the artistic development of one of the great innovators in jazz through his earlier recordings. Highly recommended.
5,IF ITS PHIL ITS WORTH IT,"I just purchased this album and i must say im very impressed with it. I never knew how good Phil was solo and live without thin lizzy. John Sykes does a good job playing the guitar and so does the rest of the band. Highlights are Sarah,Old Town,Solo in Soho and basicly both albums are amazin. The one thing like the other reviwer said is that both albums contain the same songs because two shows were recorded in the same day. So i say buy cause its really hard to pass up something that has to do with Thin Lizzy or Phil Lynott.PEACE OUT"
3,Before You Shell Out Your $$$$$$,"Just a word of caution, not a review ""per se"". Yes this is a soundboard recording, but still very raw. John Sykes's guitar is so low in the mix it is literally absent on the first two tracks and just barely audible on most of this release.Whoever was working the soundboard did not start raising the volume on Syke's guitar until well into tracks 3 & 4; and even then the volume of the keyboards drowns out much of his playing.Yes this is a must have for ANY Phil Lynott fan. But do not expect anything even close to Thin Lizzy on these discs."
5,DNA,Most inspiring movie i have ever seen. jeff goldblum is wonderful. Only available as vhs cause it is considered educational material.
5,Race for the Double Helix,"This Movie Starring Jeff Goldblum and Tim Piggot'Smith is a must for anyone interested in the history of science. It deals with the events surrounding the discovery of the structure of DNA. Set in England in the 1950s we see Crick and Watson 'who are supposed to be engaged in other things' searching to answer the big scientific question of the day. Dramatic and amusing, this film is also an inspiration to anyone dreaming of a serious career in higher education or research."
5,Please release on DVD,"This movie is beautifully done and as gripping as any race could be. I beg that it be released on dvd. If it is being sold as an educational dvd, think how many more buyers could be spending money for it if it was sold on Amazon. Selling many units at a lower price seems to make good business sense.The acting is perfection and the casting includes many talented actors. I am not a science teacher or a student, but I love this film. I beg that it be released on dvd. I will be the second in line to order my copy."
1,SOA - Stale On Arrival,"I bought two boxes to be deliverd on Mother's Day. Both were received as stale, dry product. Very disappointed and embarassed."
5,Charming and provocative reflections on how we live,Bravo! Aki Busch takes us on a charming and provocative stroll both through her home and each of ours. Ever wonder why you still have a front door? Or whatever happened to the front porch? Or why your kitchen and closets and garage are so essential? READ THIS BOOK and find out!!
3,A bit thin for the price and for a Princeton book,"I may be a bit hard on this book because I have written on similar subjects on Japan and I was expecting more insight. It's my hobby to read everything I can on how people live and so I was looking forward to this book. But if you have read on this subject in popular magazines, I suspect you will find that you already know much of what's in this book of essays. And it's only 160 pages with not a lot of print on each, so expensive.My suggestion if you are interested in this subject is to start with Witold Rybczynski's HOME: A SHORT HISTORY OF AN IDEA, which Busch cites. HOME is insightful, well-researched, and as well written as Busch's easy read."
4,"A pricey, and rare find","The ABEKA curriculum is excellent. It is to the point, easy to supplement, and has a genuine Christian perspective. It's unfortunate that you cannot obtain individual worktexts from ABEKA. I was fortunate to find an unused book. The price however was high."
5,Perfect Start,"For a first time father, this is exactly what the doctor ordered. You're entering a completely new world and most of which is a bit scary. A little guidance is needed. This book gives you the key ""need to know"" facts and is written in a manner that most men can relate to. There are plenty of books out there that feel like they are written by somebody's Grandmother that don't translate to you. Not the case with ""No Fear of Fatherhood"". When the baby comes, you're realize that the book has a lot of real life value that you'll see come to life."
5,Great for the first time dad!,I found the book to be perfect as I prepare to become a father for the first time. It was written in a very straight forward manner while at the same time being very informative. There were many topics I had not even considered until reading this book. I think it will be a good base to build off of as a new dad!
2,Good but not Great,"I'm not a hair dryer connoisseur, and I have 100% curly hair and just wanted it to dry my hair before I flat iron it occasionally but it kinda leaves my hair frizzy and not smooth like it says ~ I can only compare it to my roommates Conair hair dryer that I seemed to get a better result with."
3,Hot tools Professional 1035 1875 Watt Direct Ion Fast Dry anti-static hair dryer,"I am not thrilled with this hair dryer. I blow dry my hair out to straighten most of the time, but noticed with this dryer it makes it too soft and too straight. It makes it look too thin and straggly. and it definitely does NOT eliminate static. Disappointed."
5,Very professional,"This hair dryer is very lightweight, plus has all kinds of features and speeds. Well worth the money."
1,Product is junk!!!!,"I recieved this product yesterday and used it first thing this morning. I turned it on to high and the on/air flow button broke. It is stuck on high and just slides up and down. I had to un-plug it and re-plug it into the outlet to use it this morning. This is made cheaply and is junk, do not spend your money on this dryer."
5,it is working great!,"got this for over a month now. It is working great. I usually do not dry my hair, but living in NE there are a lot of snow days in the winter. I need to dry my hair before I head out. I am very satisfied with this hair dryer."
4,A very good hair dryer...but a little too loud.,"I've found this hair dryer to meet my needs drying my longer hair, and it's a much appreciated lighter weight than my last one. However, I do wish it was a little quieter on high speed, or else have a medium speed setting to select."
2,Worked great for about a week,"I was happy with this dryer for about the first week, after which Low speed no longer worked and it was stuck on High all the time. It sounds like a few other reviewers have had this same issue. I would not recommend this product, and am going to buy the Helen of Troy Professional Ceramic Hair Dryer (which I've used at my gym and works great, and seems to be a higher quality product) instead."
2,Worked great...for about a year,"I bought this a little over a year ago, used it 5 to 6 times a week to dry my short hair, and kept the dust/lint trap clean regularly. Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly. However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air. I put up with this for a couple of weeks until one day it blew only cold air. Very disappointing, as I'd really liked everything else about this dryer. It's now been replaced with a lesser but more dependable brand until I can find something comparable. Look elsewhere or expect a limited product lifespan."
2,Dries and breaks fast!,I was impressed with this hairdryer until it broke on me the fourth time using it! I would advise you not to purchase this.
1,Junk! It died after a year of moderate use.,"It was not quiet and not fast. The supposed ionic function is a bunch of hooey. Fine, for the price I could just say, ""whatever."" The ion thing was just a sales gimmick I fell for. Unfortunately, after a year of moderate use it suddenly developed a stench and then died in about 30 seconds. No, it wasn't clogged with hair or anything like that."
1,Defective,"We ordered this as a Christmas gift on the recommendation of our stylist. She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer. However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting. We will need to return it."
1,Great while it lasted,"I recently purchased this blow dryer and flat iron at the same time for my own personal use. This came shortly after retiring my previously used items after four+ years of use. While the flat iron is still working fine, the blow dryer quit working approximately 50 days after purchase. I am presently writing the manufacturer and will update this if I receive a response."
2,Not what I expected,I was looking for a book that used the general theories of leadership from the point of view of Tao. Instead of that this book is more like daily reflections catergorized into leadership skills.I ended up tossing this book aside and picking up The Tao of Personal Leadership. I suggest doing the same.
4,Listen to the 2nd CD,"When I bought this, I ended up disappointed. The mechanically reproduced versions of famous themes were terrible, Tubular Bells (the theme from The Exorsist) especially...HOWEVER....there was a second CD in the package. It is an all original piece called Music of The Vampires, and worth every penny you spend on this CD. I have three in my collection, just to make sure I never lose it. Every year since I first found it, I put this CD on before any others as I decorate for All Hallow's Eve.Enjoy, children of the night."
2,"you won't like it , if you love the original soundtracks","the selections of the songs are ok, but it can't be compared with the original versions."
4,If you dont like it dont liston to it!,This CD is one of my favorite. Its weird and funky. Its like a mix between Goth Tecno and Clasical Romanian Folk Music. If that dosent sound good that dont buy the CD. Simple as that.
5,Please Help to Get this book REPRINTED!,"I attended a book signing and tasting at ""The Festival of the Book"" in Charlottesville, Va on Sat. 3/22/03. I mey Delores Kostelni and tasted 5 of her cookies. They were fabulous and I'd love to add this book to my collection. I enjoy baking but don't usually have the time to make 4-5 dozen . Making a dozen would be more practical and more enjoyable.Let's try to help to get this book reprinted for this lovely lady!"
5,COOKIES BY THE DOZEN IS A GREAT IDEA!,"Apparently Cookies by the Dozen is out of print and this is too bad for all of us who want to make homemade cookies but have neither the time nor money to prepare 50 or more from a standard recipe. This concept is a great idea for baby boomers, grandmothers who have their grandchildren over to make cookies for dessert or a snack, for couples, for small families, for everyone who desires the pleasures, flavors, and aromas associated with making homemade cookies and who do not have all day to devote to doing it. This book is so wonderful, the recipes so easy and practical that I would hope Warner Books would get in touch with the author to add more recipes and they would reissue it--and soon."
2,It works ok on some items but not others,I had ok luck with this used on a chair that needed cleaning but was very unhappy with the results on a greasy stain on the carpet. HOST worked much better and had a better smell to it.I'm going to stick to HOST because it gives better results all around.
2,It did everything but work.,"The product has a generous supply in each can. Easy to use or apply, it went on neatly and smoothly, keeping within the spray target area. No foul odor or leakage, it was great. Then, I waited the minute indicated and wiped. The stain from clean oil was still there. A very impressive product that did everything with aplomb except the ultimate task of removing an oil stain."
5,Great Product!,"I've used this product for many years and it's the best carpet cleaner I've found. I also use it on home carpet stains as it works better than almost all the ""commercial grade"" carpet cleaners I've tried over the years for home use. Highly recommend for use in the car as well as home. It won't get everything out but almost everything..."
4,good action film,"Finally a good Dean Cain film! I think he's a wonderful actor but I've been watching a lot of his films which I don't think were very good - not his acting, but poor plots, writing and directing. This one great action film - the plot is decent and lets Cain show his acting ability. The plot is a reminds me a lot of Towering Inferno and Mission Immpossible 1."
5,Great Country CD's,This is the best set of country cd's I have ever purchased. We love to sing with them as we go down the road! Absolutely worth it!
1,This book is not what it appears,This book was completely worthless to me and be careful as the picture that appears is not the book you will be receiving as the plates indicated are missing and there are not enough pages to even begin to encompass the plates referenced in the index. The picture was completely misleading - again be careful.
5,Timeless,"If you're reading this, I reccomend you stop and just watch it! This man is a legend. Everything he says still holds true"
5,"Meanwhile, Jules Feiffer writes another winner...","Those of you who are long-ago fans of the wit of Feiffer's Phantom Tollbooth will be charmed by this picture book about young Raymond, who gets out of chores, perils with pirates, mountain lions, and Martians by writing out the magic word ""MEANWHILE...,"" thus zipping himself instantaneously into a new story.The book is filled with Feiffer's imaginative comic-style illustrations to go with the amusing story. I surely do wish Feiffer would write more children's books, his books are unbeatable for their combination of humor and imagination. Especially good (but not only good) for little boys."
5,Fabulous Book for Kids and Adults,"Tlhis book captures the attention of every ADHD reader and explains where a mind can get side tracked and not do what is being asked to do. I read it out loud to my husband and we have laughed about having ""meanwhile"" moments and getting distracted easily ever since. This book is written like an oversized cartoon and speaks to young children and creates a desire to read. I only wish this book was still in print. It took a long time to find a copy for my new grandson. I am so glad Amazon found a perfect hardback copy for us."
5,Teaching tool!,I have been using this book to teach plot in my 5th grade classroom. We then used it to discuss good transition words that are used in writing. Now my students are writing their own stories with dialogue and a word that send their characters into a new situation. They really loved the book!
3,Meanwhile,"This book, written in a comic book style is the story of a young boy's imagination. This is a good book to use as a model for writing this style, although the storyline is a bit confusing for young readers, due to the frequent changes in setting."
2,Skip unless you have some spare money.,I don't think this guy actually knows what he's talking about really. It felt like as if he had only a point and keep on talking and talking about it to make up this book. I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one.
3,Just ok,"Beautiful scenery and acting and a decent if not a little simplistic and empty plot. It failed to make me care about any of the characters and I found I didn't care one way or the other how the film ended. It could be that guns, bad guys and rueful villains seem trite nowadays. Or, the film could have spent a little more time on character development and a bit of backstory would have been a BIG plus."
1,Save you money,"Poor movie quality, movie kept stopping then re-start with poor picture. Hard to understand their language, poor ending. Way over priced at 8.00, wait till it drops to .99 then maybe watch."
3,Not for climbers...,"This is a decent story and a relativly entertaining film. If you're here for the climbing content, prepare to be dissapointed. Please see North Face for a more satisfying experience.Anyone else think that the overwhelming amount of product placement was hysterical?"
3,Entertaining Thriller -- With Some Caveats.,"This movie is a mixed bag, but it is entertaining overall!Pro: Lots of action, very suspensefulEntertaining until the very endBeautiful mountain sceneryDecent actingCon: Unnecessary gore. How many times can the audience watch a man get shot while blood splatters everywhere and still enjoy it? Once was enough. And the list several 1/3 of the film, someone died every 5 minutes!Some jaded plot elements--like the clueless cop; young people hiking and running into snipers and other dangers; and the most ubiquitous -- people paying a ransom without getting police involved.Dragged on at times. Could have been cut by about 10 or 15 minutes.Ending a bit unresolved. Could have done more for the audience, given the wait.FINAL THOUGHT: Was it really worth the physical costs to save the girl?"
5,Two thumbs up!,"Many great heartwarming stories packed into one terrific book! These stories make you want to send a ""birthday surprise"" of your own to someone very special! This book will surely be on your shelf for many years. Don't miss the short stories from your favorite authors in Birthday Surprises."
1,You don't receive all the items,I ordered this starter kit for my son for his birthday. I only received the album. You do NOT get the 9 pocket pages or the 3 pack of 100 sportcard sleeves!!!! Not such a great deal anymore!
4,Good,The album looks nice and seems to be well made. Made a great gift to my nephew that is crazy about baseball cards.
2,Not very good,"The rings don't work very well. Neither of the top or bottom tabs operate the rings, so the only option is to pull the middle ring apart. Sometimes the rings don't line up right when you snap them back together. Poor fit and finish. You can get a comparable binder for less money elsewhere."
5,GOOD STUFF,Ive had this dvd for a whole year now.. and i still watch it. Its different. It turned into something to watch when i was bored too something i loved
1,why why why,"Kabir's poems have been translated into English by many people.Read any one of them. But don't read this contamination, this desecration of Kabir's beautiful poems. Bly isn't translating from any original language. He translates from an English translation that he himself considers ""hopeless"" into his own version of them. What can he hope to accomplish by this? Aside from the fact that the translations he works from were done by Rabindranath Tagore and he is unable to appreciate what are, in my opinion, some of the most beautiful poems ever, how many times removed from the truth (to paraphrase Plato) is he trying to get? He admittedly violates chronology by replacing ""a deadly weapon"" with ""a loaded gun"". He should just have used that gun to shoot his manuscript to shreds. To all aspiring poets, never ever do to another man's work what Robert Bly has done here to Kabir and Tagore."
3,Why not wake up this morning?,Why not wake up this morning?He is the breath inside the breath.This includes some stories about Kabir.
3,Just another baby doll,This product was way over priced for what it was. It was just a general baby doll. Save your money and buy the same thing at Walmart for half the price.
1,It's the wrong battery stupid/ It was supose to be spring a top battery,Going to send back these batterys they are the wrong ones. I wanted spring top rechargeable batterys.
5,Very Informing,"I definitely feel that I was able to learn vital information from this video. If you're in anatomy classes, this is the video for you."
5,For class,My wife uses this to instruct her pre nursing class. Its a great movie for that sort of venue.
1,DEAD SEA SCROLLS,About 5 minutes on the actual Dead Sea Scrolls and the rest a bunch of babble...............TERRIBLE!! Don't waste your time or money.
1,Mysteries of the Dead Sea Scrolls,"I thought the first part was a preview of what was on the disk.It was not. It was not the whole story or part of the story,It was about putting the pices back together. What a ripoff.I'm glad I bought this used and only spent a little money, otherwiseI would be very upset."
2,For Goldblum Diehards Only,"Jeff Goldblum is a very funny man who has a penchant for being in very unfunny comedies (""Vibes,"" ""Earth Girls Are Easy,"" ""Beyond Therapy,"" ""Transylvania 6-5000,"" the list goes on). Unfortunately, ""Shooting Elizabeth"" is yet another in this long line. It has its moments and the occasional amusing line--usually when Goldblum is alone and hamming it up--but for the most part it falls flat. Its crazy plot about how he wants to murder his wife (Mimi Rogers) is supposed to give the film a screwball feel, but it just comes off as silly. Rogers doesn't have much of a part, and there is zero comic chemistry between the two of them. On the whole, this is only for those who must see everything Goldblum makes."
1,Disappointed !!!!!!!!!!!,"One of the stones was missing. I was disappointed, however the return policy states, ""You can not return any body jury"". Therefore, now I have to keep it. (Very disappointed, and a waste of my money"
3,Good resource for publishers.,I purchased this book to use in our Book of the Fantastical and it proved highly useful. Great for publishers looking for good clip-art work.
3,"Love Scofield, but not this one","I'm a huge John Scofield fan. I was a little disappointed by this recording. I found it uninspiring. Sorry, I call it like I see them. I have about 20 of John's cd's and I love most of them. It bothers me to have to write a ""not-so-great"" review because I'm such a fan. I highly recommend: ""A Go Go"", ""I Can See Your House From Here"" (with Pat Metheny) and my favorite ""Bump""instead if your looking for some great Sco music."
5,Good to Have,"This title has proven to be useful to our learning the quarterstaff. The book is detailed though the presentation is a bit confusing, so read through the book thoroughly before starting. Illustrations are a bit dark, hard to see. Worth the buy for us."
5,Nutrition Kitchen Organic Whole Golden Soybean Pasta,I came across this product after I had tried the whole black soybean pasta. The black pasta tasted great but the color was a little strange. This product tastes great and looks like regular pasta. I will continue to order this product in the future.
1,tastes nothing like pasta,"i was excited about trying this alternative to regular pasta, especially since the reviews were so positive. however, everyone in my family absolutely HATED the flavor of this spaghetti. it did not absorb any of the sauce flavors i mixed it with, and its own flavor was just so over powering. the texture, too, was unpleasant, even a bit slimy. i gave away 11 boxes. what a waste. i'd recommend to try 1 box first before purchasing a case."
1,dishonest,"A few years ago while doing research on my thesis, ""Religion and the Constitution,"" I read Tim LaHaye's book Faith of our Founding Fathers. I was less than impressed and when I read his chapter on the Five Most Influential Founding Fathers, I was totally dumbfounded when he left out Thomas Jefferson. Why? The only reason I can think of is that Jefferson's religious views were not Christian. Incredible. Shouldn't Amercia's third President and the author of the Declaration of Independence have at least a mention as an influential founding father? Talk about revisionist history."
1,Biased propaganda!,"Fortunately, I didn't buy this book; it was a gift and not a very welcome one.Friends and relatives are always trying to convince me, an atheist, to adopt some religion or at least acknowledge god.From the beginning, this book was obviously biased on the subject of our nation's ""religious"" foundation and vehemently opposed to any secular involvement.If you have any reservations about our nation's ""foundation,"" this book won't help!Norm"
2,"Well Intentioned, But Off Center","Mr. Lehaye's clear intent was to bolster our confidence in the Christian roots of our country. Unfortunately, his depiction while factual leaves out ideas that would give his reader's a better perspective on the Faith of our ForeFathers."
2,To much expectation for an average album....,Hey you Luis A. Torres Salazar......why are you saying a lot of crap?..i just heard a few days ago the aina album...and i was dissapointed because i expect a lot of this project with stars of nightwish...edguy..glenn hughes..etc....but nothing...just a few songs deserve just to listen sometime..nothing comparable with a true metal opera like Avantasia....but what can i say about your review if it seems you don't know almost nothing about hard rock - metal music....savage garden good???...please...stay in your business.......from a pissed and concerned true hard rock - metal fan...
1,Factual Gaps: How the AAUW is Still Failing Our Children,"More garbage from the people who claimed there was a ""crisis"" in education for girls when in fact female standards of behavior and learning enforced by women teachers and administrators were damaging our boys. The AAUW has no shame or honesty."
3,The book is pretty boring.,"Overall, We believe that the book is very informative and could be helpful for those going into the education field. But it is difficult to sit and read the whole thing through because it is a report and is therefore just facts and recommendations. We do believe that it would be beneficial for future educators to read it so they might know what's going on out there and how to help make things better."
2,"Great research book, but not recommended for enjoyment.","This book was a very researched and accurate book, but I did feel like there were some biased issues. If you need to research for a paper on gender inequity, this is definitely what you will need, but I did not find it a very good book to leisurly read. I was somewhat dissapointed because it stated the same thing over and over again. It kept showing charts of girls and boys tests results and classes they took. This was too repetitive and it did not even tell why or if boys and girls taking these classes really made a significant difference. It was required for an education class I took and now I wish I would have read another book instead of this one because I really did not enjoy it whatsoever."
5,Awesome review guide,"This book salvaged me for AP Micro and Macro. I had a teacher who was teaching AP Econ for the first time, so I knew I needed a review guide. I picked up the Princeton Review, and it helped me get a 4 and a 5 (the 4 was due to labor markets---in my opinion, one of the hardest concepts of AP Micro)."
3,Wonderful Album,One nit: the constant oscillation of the accompaniment between left and right channels of Mai Cosi' is very annoying with headphones on.
5,Living With Uncertainty,"What's under a play? What holds it up? are the first two sentences of John Patrick Shanley's preface. He then continues, There is something silent under every play. Shanley isn't interested in the plot of Doubt at face value. He doesn't believe that the play is a critique about the Catholic Church before Vatican II nor does he believe it is about pedophilia. Shanley is most interested in asking questions like, Have you ever held a position in an argument past the point of comfort? Have you ever defended a way of life you were on the verge of exhausting? It is Sister Aloysius, the cold Nun, versus Father Flynn, the warm preist, and it's left to the readers or audience to determine who is right and who is wrong, but Shanley layers the story with complexities that make a straight answer impossible. I think that's why this play was received so well."
5,Simple yet effective,"A lot had already been written by other reviewers about the script, so I will not repeat what has already been said. I cannot agree more with the rave reviews. Just would like to assert and to reaffirm that fact that the script is well structured, with no redundancy in word, in the theatricality, or in the direction. I have personally not been able to see either the play on stage or the movie on screen, but I must say the drama as written in word succeeded abundantly in producing suspense while maintaining its poise (without ever divulging more than is necessary). Just a wild guess that something bad did happened in the play, but not exactly as what was suspected. In other words, I think the author did convey a truth, and you could guess it if you are careful enough."
2,Don't expect the original!!,"I was so looking forward to this CD as it has all the old hits and bands of my era. I was sorely disappointed when I discovered that not only were they not original cuts but I don't think they are even the same bands. Often times very poor imitations. If you're looking for the real thing - stay away from this one. Having the original band associated with the title of their hit is very misleading and nowhere does it state not by original artists. Is this what ""IMPORT"" means?"
5,Great punk band,"Friend of mine in college bought a Fast album in the early eighties.Very hard, fast and tight. Quite a contrast from the Sex Pistols, they had a very American sound.Sadly their cover of Paint It Black is not on this collection."
5,I Scream for Ice Cream,This book has proved that the recipes chosen were good choices. I haven't made a bad quart of ice cream yet! Makes you feel good and confident when you can pull off a delicious gelato or green tea ice cream yourself! YUM-O!
4,Delish,Lots of easy recipes to follow. I just got my ice cream maker for Christmas and made my first batch. The recipes in the book fit the 1.5 quart bowls that I have perfectly. Looking forward to trying other flavors.
2,Not as good as other ice cream books.,"This book had some nice pictures, but the recipes were not as interesting as those in some other Ice Cream/ Gelato books offered by Amazon."
5,This book is the best!!!,"This book was very helpful with finding most of the mansions hidden treasures. It took me 15 hours to beat this game. iI bet if i tried I could have beat the game without it. I have already played it 7 times!!! I love this game!! This book shows you how to win the game with A-Rank,$40,000,000 to spare. It have maps that are unbelievably detailed!! It shows you every coin, dollar, rare jewel, golden mouse, and Blue Ghost. You will get all Gold Frames with this book.I recommend this book to everyone who loves this game!!!"
3,Okay,Helped finish the game showed you where to get what you need. The kids enjoyed the way it showed you where to go
4,Works,"These fit almost perfectly, they were a tad short, but not so short as to make them unusable.Pretty much as advertised, if you need 'em, buy 'em!"
3,Does not fit my model like advertised.,"These filters did not fit the my model humidifier like advertised. However they are easy to ""trim."" You can use a knife and cut a glue-strip and remove the excess portion. So they turned out to be ok."
4,Great humidifier media,"These are the good ones. Made of pleated sheets with beads of plastic to hold it in shape. This is not the expanded paper stuff that you usually find. I did have to cut it down a bit to fit my humidifier, but worth it to get good media."
2,Product packaging a MESS!,The filters had to be pieced together to make them work. The box and the filters were literally falling apart. A little shocked that someone would ship them in that condition.
3,Pretty Nice,Pretty good audio book. Especially enjoyed the poem by S. Wilkins. I would like to see/hear more from him.
3,Are there different versions being sold?,"Mine arrived in a USPS priority mail box. The helmet and strap assembly were alone in the box. No warranty card, no instructions, no manufacturer ID, no nothing. Just the helmet and the strap. I see from other reviewers that some were assembled and some were not. The glass on mine did not have the ansi standard etched into it. It took me a couple of minutes to understand that you had to disassemble the two screw wheels to attach it to the helmet.As for how it performs, it worked just fine of shielding my face from the arc, though I can't seem to get the screw wheels on the side of the helmet tight enough to keep the helmet from continually falling down. The mask is thin plastic, and while it probably doesn't need to be anything more than this, it does seem flimsy; I'm afraid of breaking these tension screws.Overall, the price is right and while I don't have a lot of experience with welding helmets, I don't think this one would stand up to daily use."
5,Perfect for beginners,Exactly what you need to start welding on the cheap. The flip up lens is a much better option than flipping your entire helmet.
4,it gets the job done,"It took a while for it to get here, and there is minor asembley required. I must also note that other than the glass its 100% plastic. but that also makes it light weight. You can either flip the mask down or flip just the dark glass up and down. It deflects even the larges sparks. Great buy for the price!"
5,awesome productprod,"this helmet turned out to be a wonderful product, love that it has the flip up lens so you can check on what you are working on! Very pleased with this!"
5,"Great Welding Hemet, Right Price, Works as described","Takes a little assembly, but super easy to put it together. I stick welded with it for about 2 hours today and it was comfortable and works as described. The flip lens is convenient."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this helmet to use at my TIG welding class. As soon as I arrived to school, my instructor warned me the helmet would give me ""sore eye"" by the end of class. Sure enough, after 2 hours of use my eyes were red and irritated."
3,Liberty Flunked,"Nevada Barr needs to return to settings that enable her to describe nature, animals and peoples' reactions to them. New York is too sterile, too controlled and too contrived a setting. After finding this author, I have read and enjoyed all of her books but this one. Her earlier works were very refreshing because they offered the reader wonderful insights into our nation's parks while allowing us to revel in Anna Pigeon's character. Please go back to the country, Nevada!"
4,Fascinating,"Liberty Falling is the first Anna Pigeon mystery I have read and I will definitely check into the others! Being a native NYer I was intrigued by the setting of Liberty Island. Then, I was spellbound as Nevada Barr wove the story and history of the island like I had never heard before. Going with her through the abandoned hospitals on the island at night was totally eerie. There were enough twists and turns in the story to keep any mystery buff guessing. Although other reviewers have said they didn't think she did a good job with the setting, I have to disagree wholeheartedly. I've been to Liberty Island and Ellis Island but while reading Liberty Falling, I felt like a tourist. Great read!"
3,NOT UP TO STANDARD,"Just finished Liberty Falling. It was not the usual quality I expect of Nevada Barr. I grant that is a high expectation, but that is why I read her books. This story struck me as contrived. Why is she in New York? Sister is very ill, but she doesn't spend much of the book dealing with Sister or illness. Frederick the Fed does that. He kind of drifts in and out of the story; definitely there, but not really contributing to it. As a Nevada Barr book, this has to be her poorest effort. A good read, but not what I have come to expect. I hope Anna gets back out to wide open places where she can be herself. New York apparantly was not the place for her."
2,What a letdown!,"Like many other Nevada Barr fans, I'm eager to read each new book. This one was a serious disappointment. The writing is stilted, packed with florid adjectives and mixed metaphors. What happened to the lean, mean prose Barr used to write?? In the novel, Anna is reading a Wilkie Collins novel, which made me wonder if Barr has immersed herself in that genre to the point where she is emulating it. Whatever the case, it doesn't work. I've read Collins' books several times and never feel I was wading through dense prose and tortured clauses -- which is how I've felt slogging through this book. (Which makes me wonder why professional reviewers don't mention these things and spare readers the cost of the hardback...)"
5,Great backdrop in Ellis Island!,"Since this was my first Anna Pigeon mystery I didn't have any problem seeing her in a national park that wasn't so ""natural.""I loved the descriptions of the crumbling buildings on the islands and found them to be wonderful eery backdrops for intrigue.The suspense plot kept my interest and gave me plenty of thrillseven as I enjoyed the gentler suspense of the sub-plot of Anna's ailing sister. I'm delighted to have discovered Nevada Barr's works."
3,Loved learning more about Liberty Island but...,"lately Barr's mysteries leave me cold. I enjoyed her earlier books and their descriptions of our National Parks. Her musings are humorous and entertaining. However, the mysteries too often lead to her fellow rangers. Even so, I will probably read ""Deep South"" and give Anna Pigeon one more try."
2,A disappointing read.,"I really enjoyed the first several books in this series, but I find this one too bound up in the relationships between Anna, her sister Molly, and Frederick, the erstwhile FBI agent who has had relationships with both women. The story, overplotted with material pertaining to Anna's personal life, moves so slowly as to be nearly stalled for the first half of the book. I'm afraid this series is spiraling into mediocrity. That's too bad, as the first several books were entertaining reads. This one, however, wasn't."
2,I would have edited this book considerably!,"After loving Barr's 'Deep South' I was disappointed with 'Liberty Falling'. The storyline contained much redundancy and what can only be called filler, in what was a terrific storyline turned tedious. It took too long to get to the real plot. The author has the reader was asking ""what is this going to be about?"" for a good while. Too many extraneous characters also."
3,I was disappointed by too much scenery & not enough mystery.,"I am a great Barr fan. She's one of the few mystery writers I buy in hardcover, but this one was a disapointment. While her discriptions of Ellis Island were interesting, I wanted more mystery and less island. Barr's still a good read, but I hope future books will reflect her earlier works."
1,Disappointed,"The Nevada Barr books came highly recommended to me. This is the first one I've read, and honestly, I am only halfway through and struggling to keep my interest up. I usually bond with the main character in a book, and can't wait to find out what happens next. I can't seem to work up any liking for Anna Pigeon, and what started out as a potentially interesting mystery has lost me in the tedious descriptions of old abandoned buildings and the slow moving plot. Not sure whether I will try this author again."
3,Good imagey,Nevada always gets into the worst situations and gets out again. References to the sites in the parks make it interesting.
1,Major Disappointment,"I've been a long time fan of Nevada Barr's writing, especially the Anna Pigeon series. However, with this last novel, I've come to the sad conclusion that the series is running out of steam. Anna seems tired. Much of this latest novel is descriptive material rather than action. I learned more about Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty than I ever wanted to know, and I'm one of those immigrants that passed through Ellis! I do not recommend this book. To those who are first time readers of the series, I would urge you to read the first several books - those are outstanding! Also, a question aimed at those who are Anna Pigeon fans: what happened to the characters Christina Walters and her daughter, Alison? They were favorites of mine, but after the first couple of novels, they somehow disappeared. What happened to them?"
1,NEGITIVE TEN,"I don't know how such a dull, boring book could get published. Don't waste your money or time. This was my first N.Barr and it will be my last. If you want good murder mysterys read any of James Lee Burke!"
2,Disappointed,"I am an AVID Navada Barr fan, but I was disappointed in this particular book. Perhaps it is because her other books are set in the wilds of nature instead of NY City. Anyway, although learning about the history behind the Statue of Liberty was a bit interesting, and (if I remember correctly) Barr delves a bit deeper into her sister's life, I still prefer her books that have Anna out in a State or National Park."
4,"Even her ""not the best"" is good","Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty are quickly explored, so there is less to learn -- or even write about -- in this espisode in Anna Pigeon's career. The upside is that we learn more about the characters of Anna and her sister, Molly, and so do they. Not being as fast-moving as the rest of this series does not condemn it. Nevada Barr is a fine writer and this is a good read. What's with the fixation on movies, though?"
4,great mystery!,"I have liked and admired Anna Pigeon since I read Nevada Barr's first book in this series but this is the first time that I really -liked- Anna as a person. Maybe it's because she's not officially on duty or maybe it's because she's in New York, but the Anna in ""Liberty Falling"" is much more approachable and human than she has been in the previous books.The story itself is first-rate with expert plotting and character development. One of the best things about the last two Anna Pigeon mysteries is that you really have to pay attention to what's going on -- Barr interweaves very subtle clues throughout the story. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the endless descriptions of the rides back and forth between the city and the monument but that's a small thing. This book is most definitely worth reading."
3,A cerebral mystery,"Anna Pigeon is staying with a ranger friend on Liberty Island while she visits her sick sister Molly who's in the hospital with a life-threatening kidney ailment. While living in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, Anna gets involved in the death of a supposed suicide. A teen-age girl leaps to her death from the top of Liberty's pedestal. If that's not enough, a few days later the security guard who tried to stop the girl from jumping dies the same way in almost the same spot. Before she knows it, Anna is caught up in a mystery involving a sleazy doctor and Castro look-alike.Like all Anna Pigeon novels, this moves slowly. It does take quite a while for the bones of the mystery to appear but Anna Pigeon is such a likeable heroine and Barr such a good writer that the book never seems to drag. At times, Barr's stream-of-conciousness style of writing can be hard to follow but overall the novel is a fun read."
4,What A Surprise!,"When I first read the synopsis of Liberty Falling, I thought, New York? Nevada Barr? No way. How in the world can you compare New York City with the deep south, the western deserts, Colorado, and the northern lakes? Although she doesn't have the beautiful landscapes to describe, she makes up for it with a very good plot line and characters that are so life-like, it's hard to believe they don't exist in real life. (I would really like to know someone like James Hatchett Sr.) I liked Anna Pigeon in Track Of The Cat and I like her more with each addition in this wonderful series."
1,One GREAT tune on a mediokre album,"Well well...""Harlem River Drive"" is awesome! But all the rest sucks. Tough life. However a secondhand < $1 offer seems more than reasonable :oP"
4,"best sorting hat out there, for the money.","There is a pocket inside the hat to put a baby monitor, or a walkie talkie- that way you can make it seem more realistic. The kids at the party were shocked that the hat was talking! I had them all put it on their head, and it sorted them into their houses for the party. Someone was in another room with a baby monitor saying the kid's names and telling them why they were chosen for their prospective house. The hat is just cloth, but, looks more like the real thing than anything else I found. My daughter hung it in her bedroom after the party."
4,Make a great decoration,"Bought for my daughter,a big Harry Potter fan, for Christmas and she loves it. It's not really a play with type toy for her, but more of a decoration. She hung it from her ceiling and it looks really neat. For the price it makes a nice decoration."
3,Sorting hat,Re doing my sons room in Harry Potter and he wanted this hat! It was okay in quality but not like the real hat! He's happy with it do I'm happy!
3,"It's alright, but nothing special","This hat is about what you would expect from a kid's costume from Party City. Mine did not stand up well on its own. The materials and appearance are not extremely convincing, either. Still, any Harry Potter fan should easily be able to recognize it instantly, so for its price I can't really complain."
2,Not what I expected,"Bought this as part of my HP collection but the quality is cheap, not what I expected at all. It's a good costume piece but over priced for the quality"
1,hate it,"this came in a box way to small, it was ripped, worst money i ever spent on a gift- will not buy again"
4,fun!,My daughter loved it! She uses it all the time AT COLLEGE! She said they all grew up watching Harry Potter...
2,Good but not worth the money,The book is a nice start. It is well written but honestly for15 dollars I expected more. I was very dissapointed and felt cheated.
1,Buy only if you have a discount.,I agree with the review below. The book is well written but for the price it needs more. It does review the different religious New Year celebrations but nothing truly revealing or new. I expected more countries to be covered as well.
5,Very Helpful Book,My children found this book easy to read and well done. My children were able to learn a lot about different cultures and their practices from this book.
2,Too wide for normal headstocks,"I bought four of these a few years ago to hang three acoustics and an electric on the walls of my home studio. My only complaint about them happens to be a pretty big one: The horseshoe-shaped part that holds the guitar is too wide for the headstock on all the guitars. So all four of the guitars are actually hanging with the weight of the entire guitar on the tuners (machine heads) instead of the headstock. At the very least, this results in the guitars going out of tune every time they are put away. At the worst, it will damage the guitars. The guitars are each made by different manufacturers and are standard sizes, so it's not a guitar-size issue. I tried to improve these hangers by bending both sides in toward each other. It helped a little bit but not enough to solve the problem. Aside from this problem, the hangers are fine. They seem solidly built and the materials seem reasonably good. But that width problem is somewhat of a deal-killer."
4,They do the job,"work great, i have 5 of them. the nut in the back sticks out a little but with an extra washer its not a problem."
4,"Nice simple hanger, NO SCREWS!",I like these hangers and bought a dozen. Now I get to drive to Lowes and buy screws and mollys to mount them to the wall. Seems odd that they weren't provided... a wall mount hanger with no screws to mount it to the wall!
3,Okay,The basics were were here but it didn't bite off what Lonely Planet usually is famous for. Pretty bland coverage for such a colourful place.
5,Very elegant set,"The rosewood version of this Royale set is beautifully done. The flourish of the king's ""cross"" is an elegant touch and still appears as a classic design. The color of the rosewood set is rich and warm, and both colors are very well finished. The pieces have a great feel and weight. Since I ordered late, I honestly expected to take the hit and not see them until after Christmas. Wrong. They got here speedy quick, even with standard shipping! Awesome packaging too! Looking forward to putting these pieces into action."
1,Christmas at Cliffhanger Inn,Waste of money-mystery has potential-price is outrageous for 74 pages. I will never buy another book of hers unless it is at least over two hundred pages.
4,A Cozy Mystery,"The writers club is packed with drama and mystery. The story of four writers who form a writers club, and whose lives intertwine throughout the book, each with a mystery to deal with and culminate at the end. I particularily liked the story of Belle Larson in 'The Weekend'. It had me riveted.This is a great book by Christine Collier."
4,A Mysterious Romp For Four Women Writers,"This collection of short stories is wonderfully written. Each member of The Writer's Club has her own mysterious experience, yet they are tied together by their love of writing and their small club. The book is a quick read, making you want to move on to the next page, and therefore, the next book!"
4,writers club,A most enjoyable book. Four separate stories intertwined because of a friendhip. Each of these stories could stand well on their own. But I loved how she brougth them all together. Each mystery is suspenseful and down to earth.
4,I hope there's a sequel!,"The Writer's Club is a collection of delightful little mysteries surrounding a group of writing friends. Each chapter is filled with intrigue and suspense, keeping the reader on edge until the mystery is solved. The author has cleverly woven the mysteries around all four women, who develop a tight-knit friendship over a five-year period. The book leaves you with the feeling that there may be more to come, which would be warmly welcomed.While this book is written for adults, I found it to be appropriate for younger readers as well, since there was no violent or expressly adult content. I eagerly look forward to the next book!"
4,A Friendly Mystery,"Ms Collier has written a friendly collage of mysteries, interweaving the lives of 4 women who share a passion for writing. Each woman faces individual events that are suspenseful and require solving, yet they always return to the group to share successes as well as endeavors. The characters are gentle, and the mysteries are appropriate for any age group, but the stories keep the reader interested and eager for more. I enjoyed this book."
3,Strangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter,"Estranged daughter of Bette Davis (played by Gena Rowlands), returns home to die from a terminal illness. Davis plays the cold, and at times heartless, bitter mother who blames Rowland's character for all that was wrong with her marriage and life. The two reconcile and all ends with the two women bravely preparing for the inevitable death of Rowland.Davis overplays her best bitchiness and does not put much genuine feeling into the role, despite her winning an Emmy for this performance. Rowland's acting was just the opposite--convincing and heart-touching as the dying woman wanting to reunite with her mother and not die alone."
3,Non-typical collection of townhouses,"If you are looking for new and typical American townhouses, you'd be disappointed by the beautiful and modern houses custom-designed by sophisticated architects in the book. But it's still a creditworthy design collection of individual luxury townhouses."
2,que lastima,"I eagerly ordered this book, having lived in Peru and wanting to fine tune some of the recipies I had put together from various sources. What a disappointment! While the author touches upon most of the major ""platillos Peruanos"" he misses the essence and soul of Peruvian cooking. He forgets to sauce the lomito with vinegar or lemon juice the causa--and his seco which should be revoltingly sea green with cilantro boasts a paltry 20 sprigs. Lambert Ortiz is a better bet by far if you want the real thing in my opinion."
5,EASY TO FOLLOW,"I have to say that my parents are from Peru and so is my husband. I already did two dishes from this book and my husband loved them. The book is easy to read and follow. It gives you a brief history of Peru's food. Where the dishes came from - the Coast, Jungle or the Mountain regions. I have cookbooks in Spanish that are from Peru, but you can't find the ingredients or you don't know what they are. I highly recommend this book. In addition, the book is in English and it gives you equivalents of the ingredients, which may not come from the US so you know what you can use if you do not have a certain product."
1,Dickenson is by far better,"Real quick, the cd is some horrible work; nothing like the real Iron Maiden with Bruce Dickenson! Maybe this one would find a place in a gothic dentist office, yuk!"
5,"Thanks ""J""","I really liked the book.I was disappointed when it was over.The book made me think about some of the people I've met in life. In addition, to some of my experiences. I was moved.I guess as a literary scholor I would be looking for all the character development and between the line plots. But, all I got was entertained along with given a bit to think about.What more could you want in a non-fiction book?"
4,Enjoyable Read,"I have always been a great fan of Ms. Cooper, and have thoroughly enjoyed her previous literary works. Having an unborn child as the narrator was genius work. However, I feel that SPSOP is not her best. I did not ""get to know"" the main characters. I would have enjoyed knowing more about Jewel and Earle, as well as a little more about the older siblings that left home. Did some of them get an education? Become successful? Also,there were other loose ends. My opinion,""Wake of The Wind"" and ""Some Love, Some Pain, Sometime"" are her best works. In all, Ms. Cooper continue to be one of my all time favorite authors."
2,Incomplete,"I am a fan of JC Cooper but this book was average, at best....In fact, I am a little upset with the whole book. It started out slow but slowly gained my interest, but the ending attempted to wrap up loose ends but did so only superficially...I felt like I wanted to like Eula Too, but now that I am thinking about it, you never really get to know her. You know what she does, but not really her. I think the characters of Ha, Lona, and Iris, which you meet almost at the end, are more vivid than Eula and Madame. The book was OK. Definitely just pick up a copy at the library instead of purchasing it like I did. I just read Tumbling, so I think alot of things will pale in comparison."
4,Great Read!!,"I am a recent J california Cooper fan and as I get to know her work. I fall in love with it more and more. Some People, Some other place is a well written story. You can tell the author has, not just the gift of storytelling but is a woman with some common sense as well. If anything I wish the book would have been longer so I could continue to see the characters develop."
2,Not her Best,I give Ms. Cooper a 2 because of effort. I really did not like this book at all. The story did not flow well and the characters simply did not attract me. I agree with one editorial that indicated that Ms. Cooper has espousing her faith too much. I did not get the unborn child thing. I believed it got in the way of tell the real story.
3,Cooper has written better,I am a fan of J. California Cooper but was a bit disappointed in this book. It was prolonged and at times confusing. Altogether not too bad.
3,"A Superb Writer, but not her Best","J. California Cooper is one of my all time favorite authors, but this book betrays her talent. It is as though she ""phoned it in"". It starts quite intriguing with an unborn child narrating the proceedings, but then it becomes cumbersome, soapy and boring.I consider myself a big fan of Cooper so I recommend that readers purchase almost any of her back catalog of excellent books, especially her short story collections, before spending money on this one."
3,"My favorite writer, NOT my favorite book...","The characters in this book did not captivate me like they did in WAKE OF THE WIND and IN SEARCH OF SATISFACTION. The two central characters Eula Too and Elizabeth seemed alittle unbelievable. For Eula Too to never be attracted to a man in 17 yrs seemed unrealistic, not just not attracted to, but the author never even has her think a man is cute. I did like the 2 central characters but didn't like many of the rest. If there is a sequel I probably won't read it."
2,It's OK,"This is as basic as it gets. If a station in your area has a strong signal to begin with, this will pull it in. However, weaker stations won't show that much improvement. If you live in an area with extremely poor reception, an amplified antenna would be a better option."
4,"Out of 10 fights, only the one between George St-Pierre and Jon Fitch is excellent.","- There are 10 fights on the first DVD. The second DVD contains bonus meterial such as Countdown to UFC 87, Behind the Scenes, etc.- There's nothing worth watching on the second disk. Out of 10 fights, only the one between George St-Pierre and Jon Fitch is excellent. Jon proved he was a very tough opponent in all 5 rounds. GSP could not deliver a knockout. UFC 87 DVD set is worth buying just because of this match.- The highly-anticipated heavyweight fight between Brock Lesnar and Heath Herring is a huge disappointment. It's an one-sided match. Brock was too big, too strong for Heath. He was 15 pounds heavier than Heath. Brock always dominated the fight. Heath could never counter attack. This match is boring."
5,Yo-Joe,This season 2 Part 1 should be part of everyone's video collection. Their's no better way to enjoy it then inside your living room. This video has a lot of action and adventure the animation I give it 9/10 go get this case.
4,The birth of Serpentor,"Man this was a great TV show, it's to bad kids today are not lucky enough to have great cartoons like this one, instead they get Poke mon etc.Wow what happened? Anyway back to the Joe's .In this season we get Serpentor and the inclusion of the B.A.T.S.( battle android troopers) wich are a great bonus so now the artists can show some actual death and dismemberment that was missing from all the previous battles.Good stuff.The only problem I feel is that there's only 15 episodes on this 3 disc release! and its been more than 6 MONTHS since its release and part 2 isnt anywere to be seen.I dont know if Rhino stoped the production or what but come on guys , get with the program.We need at the very least the rest of season 2 dammit.I recommend these box sets to any old schooler that grew up watching this show after school back in the day.Man , the memories.sigh."
5,Good Place to Start - especially for the price!,"Persian Tutor by Professor Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak is an interactive CD-ROM that is designed with both the beginner through advanced student in mind. Learn the Persian alphabet and beginning reading and writing principles. Practice speaking Persian through exciting and realistic street scenes. Persian Tutor delivers more instruction, more effectively than many other higher priced products on the market today.This is not a complete course, but its a good place to start, especially since so many get stuck on the alphabet. This CD will teach you the accurate pronunciation of the alphabet - at your own pace. Once you've learned pronunciation and reading, the dialogue section is a lot of fun! You'll like the graphics of the Iranian city: the market place, food, friends, hotel, even the taxi! It's a cultural experience."
5,This artist sounds AWESOME!!!,"Oh my Goodness!!! This artist definitely has a future in the Godspel, this is contemporary, but truly a tribute to the most High God!! I wish there were more detail regarding any additional songs on this CD!! It makes you want to purchase the entire CD if all the songs has this much vigor and offer soooo much praise!!"
5,"A Boston T. Party ""Must Read!""","In his book ""Drug War Addiction,"" Libertarian Sheriff Bill Masters decloaks the immorality, futility, and brutality inherent to the War On (Some) Drugs. It is heartening indeed to read of a true Peace Officer who understands and actively supports individual liberty and responsibility, rather than the typical ""Law Enforcement Officer"" who can only fall backon the disproven and disreputable ""solution"" of government intervention into personal affairs.If America's police were comprised of Peace Officers of Bill's integrity and honesty, many of my own books would overnight become unnecessary--which is the highest compliment I can offer. Buy ""Drug War Addiction"" to learn why we must immediately cease fire on our own people--most of whom are needing help, not prison."
5,An encouraging study on guilt,Who would think a study guide about guilt would be encouraging? Yet that is exactly what this guide is. Brent takes us on a journey from false guilt to true guilt and then shows how true guilt is actually the pathway to freedom. A great study for individuals or groups!
5,Recommended by the accidental quilter,"You've got all these quilts! What are you going to do with them? Beautiful color plates show how the movers and shakers in the quilt making and quilt collecting world display quilts around the house. I was particularly intrigued with the chapter on Sewing Studios. They are warm, homey places that employ many antique pieces for storage and decoration. And every idea doesn't require a show place of a home either. On page 35--they show several old quilts tucked into an easy chair and covering a table--it would look cosy anywhere!"
4,"Great, reliable player...but.......","I've had this player for almost 5 years now, and it's been very good to me since I originally purchased it. It hasnt had any compatibility issues, and usually played without skipping.As of last week or so, I began having problems with skipping on dvds. I presume I'll have to open it and manually clean the lens. After 5 years, I cant say I dont expect it to some degree. I'm not too worried, I think a simple cleaning will solve the issue.I do recommend you buy this, it's a reasonably priced vcr/dvd player, looks nice, and works pretty well. Take good care of it and it should last years."
3,"Great stories, Horrible Stories","Some of the stories were stupendous, but some of the other stories were just depressingly boring. If your a diehard dler and a dragonlover go for it other wise hold off."
4,Getting to Know the Dragons,"Here's a collection of Dragon stories. Some very good, some just so-so. Interesting pieces include ""The Final Touch"", ""The Best"", ""Kaz and the Dragon's Children"", ""Dragon Breath"", ""The Middle of Nowhere."" ""The First Dragonarmy Bridge..."" introduces us to the pitiful draconian brigade whom one will meet in greater detail in ""The Doom Brigade"". Some of the stories end abruptly (""Into the Light"" is one) while I find ""Honor..."" a bit tiresome to read. The rest of the stories are worth reading. All in all, this is a good book to get acquainted with the most popular and most awesome creatures in Krynn - dragons."
2,ONE OF THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie has nothing to do with the house and I don't think the title should even contain the word Amityville cause It has nothing REALLY to do with Amityville. If you want to fall asleep at night, put this movie in and I guarentee you will be asleep in less than 15 minutes. (Another good movie to fall asleep by is ""High Planes Drifter"")"
1,Such a Horrible Movie.The Amityville Curse 1989,"The Amityville Curse 1989 is a Canadian Made movie, It's such an Awful movie, not even scary. It's so bad you can't wait for each character to meet their end in the movie! Horrible Acting."
2,"""I Almost nailed Marvin""","That one guy who is in alot of films is in this. He plays the guy with the glasses who is a chainsmoking, sweater fiend. This is a strange film with bad acting and a couple of ""Who is that"" actors. Also one of the guys is clearly Canadian."
3,Part 4 is based on a true story & part 5 kind of is,"Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes This one continues where part one left off at, and it is based on a true story.The actual true story of ""The Amitville Curse"" took place in the house the first one took place in. In this one it is a different house that is in Amityville. I red the book by Hans Holzer, and it took place in the same house that the first took place in. Some of things that happened in this one I don't recall happening in the book ""The Amityville Curse"", such as the murder of a priest at his church, and the murderer of that priest living in that house."
1,BORING!!!,"This is an awful movie. Obviously the writers were so desperate for ideas that they decided to try to take this Amityville film out of the Amityville house. It has nothing to do with Amityville, and I still am puzzled by the fact that this movie bears the name Amityville in it's title. All I can say is it is not for people with a short attention span. If you're looking for something exciting, I would choose a Mr. Rogers re-run over this one."
4,Read it For Yourself!!!,"I loved it loved it loved it. There is nothing like a well written love story that we all can relate to in one way or another. The author has a true gift and this little known book needs to be discovered. You can actually feel the pain of the characters - some of the most developed characters I've ever had the pleasure to meet; and that is exactly how it felt; that I know these people. The friendship and loyalty displayed makes this reader long for such an experience; even the painful, heartbreaking parts because the sacrifices made can only be made by one who truly knows how to love. Read it - enjoy it and then pass it along to a friend."
3,A Visual Treat,"As an historical record, and for those of us who are fascinated by any of the principals of this book (Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, John Burroughs, or Harvey Firestone), the photographs presented in this book are priceless. Here are personal and private glimpses of these men that have rarely been seen, at least in the past 70 years, and certainly not in such a consolidated format.My only reservation is that the text is not as rich as the imagry. There are brief passages associated with each set of photographs, and there is the occasional anecdote. But the texture of the photographs leaves one yearning for more information about these men and their friendship, their lives, and their worlds. Still, even for the photographs alone, it is a worthwhile book..."
3,Mis-identified photographs,"Nice book, well done, I am sure well researched, but there are a number of photographs mis-identified. Some text out of context."
1,incorrect in a dozen different ways,"This book is riddled with mistakes, particularly in regard to John Burroughs. --- E. Kanze"
3,Decent debut,"Lennox did a good job debuting into the literary industry with her captivating novel. This book deserves to be in a class all by itself, simply because it showed the other side of the hustling game...the addiction, hurt, confusion, pain, and betrayal. ""Crack Head"" did not promote the ""so-called"" glamorous side of the hustle and when it did it did not glorify it. The story and the characters came off as real which made the story a very easy and touching read. Nice job to Lisa Lennox who put the other side of the hustle on paper."
3,ok,"this was a quick read. some of the plot was a little hard to believe. it wasn't the best urban fiction i ever read, but it was not the worst either."
5,THIS BOOK WILL HAVE YOU ADDICTED!!!,"This book was so good. I read it in two days.It shows how girls can be real trifling, and how your so-called friends can really be against you. Be careful cause your friends just might not be who you think they are. This books shows why envy is one of the 7 deadliest sins. Also how strong and bad jealousy is. THIS IS A MUST READ!!! EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS. ESPECIALLY TEENS. ESPECIALLY THE ONES LOOKING FOR ACCEPTANCE!!! 10 STARS!!! I wil be waiting for her next novel. Great debut album Lisa Lennox!!!"
5,CRACKHEAD WOW,This book starts of slow but once it gets going its a good read .. It shows how easy it is to get caught up and not even realize you caught up!
4,Jealous B**ches!,"I could not beleive how Laci's so called friends got her hooked on crack! Those little gold digger, low life tramps. OOOOOH I was so mad when Crystal did that to her. But like they say, what goes around comes around, and Crystal got hers! This book just keep me turning the pages, I couldn't stop reading until I hit the last page!"
5,read this,I'm personaly not a reader but when i picked up CrackHead i couldn't put it down.I read this novel in ! day .this book realy takes you back and tells the story of so many peoples life.This book is a real eye opener.
4,excellent book,"My standards are high! My favorite books are B-more careful, the coldest winter ever, and lil mama's rules. I thought this book came close (not 5 stars like the previously mentioned books) but close. The book is exciting, suspenseful, and well written. I couldn't put it down. Check it out, you won't regret it."
