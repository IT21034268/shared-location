2,Good for today's rap but still crap,"In 2003, Lloyd Banks was riding on 50 Cent's success. Hunger For More is a nice effort to go solo and better than Young Buck and Tony Yayo. That doesn't make the album any better. 80 % of the album is filler, including the singles which have nice beats. The best song is ""When the Chips are Down"", featuring The Game. He completely outshines Banks bigtime. Another good one is ""Warrior Part 2"", produced by Eminem and featuring Eminem, Nate Dogg, and 50 Cent. As before, everyone outshines Lloyd banks.I only reccomend HFM to G-Unit fans"
2,Wack - sh#t,The major labels dont get it yet artist like this should be banned! There nowere near the quality of a Traum or Cormega yet they get all the light please help us. Labels like Masta Mix Records wouldnt even talk to these cats and the dirty south is running rap byt the cant rap thanks to the majors!!!!
2,What Happened??????,What the hell happened. he was tight on the g-unit album.this had horrible production.thank god i got it for 10 bucks.
2,Save your money,"I'm trying out bolts and strikers for a LP conversion, and the stock bolt worked better than this one. The whole Delrin idea was a good one... but it didn't work out. I guess that is why they are going for so cheap now, they need to get rid of them while they still can! [...] This guy really knows his stuff!"
2,You get what you pay for,"for $40 I figured this might be worth it. This set will indeed cut perfectly flat bottoms. I do not exactly use my dado set a bunch, but the carbide on most of my chippers is chipped. chipped chippers are no fun and the amount of use my set recieves it should still be flawless. also even laying down blue tape there is still quite a bit of tear out on hardwood plywoods when cutting cross grain. it does quite well along the grain however. the case is a nice touch and keeps the set nice and safe. so in summary, this is not a long term investment and it will cut nice flat grooves. it cuts nice flat dadoes as well, but you will get unacceptable chip out if you use plywoods with their thin veneers. a good set for the occasional use in solid wood. I just recently upgraded, I figured that every time I chipped out on a $100 sheet of cherry ply I was not exactly saving money."
2,"off by 1/64""","I've tried two of these dado sets, and in both cases one of the cutters was larger in radius than other. This makes a visible ""step"" in the bottom of the dado, with one side about 1/64"" lower than the other. The two sets were purchased years apart, so it seems to be an ongoing problem. The Mibro dado set is good enough for rough work, or to hog out most of the material so you can finish with a router or plane."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!,"Manufactured to very poor specifications, very difficult to install, spacers have poorly punched arbor openings with very jagged burrs. If you want quality do not look here."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"After all the gripes and complaining about what kind of box these are packed in, I was a bit leery about the true quality of the blades. But I was indeed pleasantly surprised to find out my doubts were unfounded. They have turned into a true pleasure to run. A bit more complicated than my last set but then too they are about twice the quality of cut and precision. I have yet to have to add any of the well made shims to correct the cut size. I would, and will if need be, buy these fine blades again. Oh, by the way... The box they came in? Perfect condition and a great added bonus as far as I am concerned."
2,Not worth the money - no matter how inexpensive,The one I purchased (not from Amazon) will not cut a flat bottom even with only the outside blades. Each chipper seems to be off from all the others. Cutting a dado looks like a staircase. I use my outside blades now to cut boards that might possibly have nails or staples. I'd rather make 20 passes with my rip blade than use this.
5,great set,This set is a great deal for the money. It does the job well and cuts a flat bottom grove. I like the box and the tool within.
4,dado blade set,"Over all this is a great quality blade set. Only complaint is that when I received it the nice wood box was all broken up and the hinge and latches were all bent to hell. Despite that the blades are very solid and very Sharp, giving u a very precise cut with the least amount of wobble or travel."
3,Good blade for the price,"Good blade for the price! Not really a clean bottom cut, but adequate. Would recommend this blade to the average do-it-yourselfer."
2,harry homeowner grade,you can tell the quality is low but it will do for occasional use buy a hobbiest or craft maker
4,Great for the money,"Before I got this I started by moving the saw after each cut to get my width, which works if you have a lot of time. So i figured I would get a stacking set. Glad I didn't get the more expensive set, this works great. Once you establish the exact width for the stock write it down for next time, this makes going from blade to blade and width to width easier. I've already made an entire bedroom suit and 22 drawers and use this every chance I can. I would recommend this for any occasional project woodworker."
3,About the box!,"I know some of you are feeling like I was while reading reviews. You are probably wondering why people are so worried about the box. Well let me enlighten you. I didn't even recieve a box. I opened the cardboard package which was still entact to find my blades sitting amongst several box pieces. It may have left the sellers location as a box, but it arrived as scrap wood. I know that down the road I will build a nice neat storage box to contain and protect my blades. I know the blades are a good deal for the price. I also know that the mdf/laminate box in the picture is not as tough as the cardboard box it will arrive in. I'm happy with the blades, but the box is so ridiculous that I had to write this review. I would actually buy this item again believe it or not."
4,Awesome deal for the money.,"Dado set works great, I have used it a number of times now with no issues. The box that it comes in should be thrown away though."
2,Mibro dato set,This dato set will cut datos but is hard to set up due to the chippers only having two sides. Most datos do not require shims to make a standard cut. This set is you get what you pay for. Not worth the money.
2,"Egh, just ok","Decent bottom of groove cut, frayed edges.I bought this as a back-up in my wood shop, and used it when my nice dado went. Oh brother, what a drag; Chipped edges in soft and hardwoods, and cheap teeth edges. I am a professional woodworker and not a home ""do-it-yourselfer"". Tip to other pros, buy a better blade. It's not worth the $40 since you'll throw away $200 worth of wood!Steve, S4S, Inc. Brooklyn, NY"
2,It makes a dado.,I was hoping for a blade set that would leave a square bottom in the dado. This is not good for box joints etc.
2,Product description is incorrect,"I bought this because the product description said it could cut a minimum dado of 1/8 inch. But when it came, I found that its minimum cut is actually 1/4 inch. You can cut a 1/8 inch cut if you use only one blade, but the safety instructions tell you not to do that. You may not want to, anyway, because the blade tips are angled, so the bottom of your slot would be left with a slope. The quality seems good and I'll keep it rather than send it back. It's bigger and has more teeth than my other set."
2,Milbro Dao Blade,Very hard to keep the outer blades at 90 degrees which makes it a pain to go thru the steps to set it up and adjust. The carbide points are not flat on the inner side as are most other dado blades.
5,Lyrical genius,"I first heard JoCo's ""Re: Your Brains"" on a World of Warcraft video, and immediately had to find out who wrote that fantastic song. Since then I've found so many gems like ""Shop Vac"" from this album, and many others from his other albums and his website, including ""Code Monkey"", ""Chiron Beta Prime"", ""Skullcrusher Mountain"" and ""Creepy Doll.""This album includes some classics, but you'll want to buy more and more of his songs if you listen to these, so be ready.He's also great in concert."
1,Backpack lack enough space,"You can fit your lap but this backpack lack enough space for other things. As a computer programmer I usually bring several things in my backpack even my lunch. This backpack is bulky my itself but you can't fit too many things in it. I used to have one and I could fit my umbrella, lunch, lap and some books."
5,Ecological wit & wisdom,"The book is an intriguing mixture of elements. On the one hand it describes the author's sometimes hilarious experiences as he seeks to answer such questions as ""how long does a whale sleep,"" and ""how much does an elephant eat."" On the other hand he raises sobering questions about the capacity of the discipline of ecology to solve environmental problems. I enjoyed the book both for its human interest and for the author's reflections on the state of our understanding of nature."
3,Not my favorite series of books,"Bye-Bye, Bully: A Kid's Guide for Dealing with Bullies (Elf-Help Books for Kids)I don't know this series of books just doesn't appeal to my boy or to me.Each book has a page with Christian references. I didn't find anything about THAT in the book reviews.The information is ok but they just don't make the points in an interesting way that speaks to either of us."
4,Fun Wolter's Book,I generally like all of Wolter's books and recommend them to anyone that is interested in hunting dogs in general or Labrador Retrievers specifically. He is always a fun read and this book is no different. Lots of neat history about the retriever breeds (all of them) and how/when they were created.
4,Possession,I love this movie and wanted to have it in my collection. Thats really all I have to say about it.
1,Bunch of black metal christians,"This is the music inspired by such ... bands like cradle of filth and dimmu burger. Just what do you people find obscure or dark and even satanic about this band? It's equivalent of those gothic fairy tale bands where members wear toilet seats, read all the hollywood vampire...novels and transfer their whining into music. Pretty Blasphemous uh? Too bad there's no flutes on this cd, it would make more sence. I'd be really ok to adimit they're just bunch of warm-hearted christians and they want all the little boys to buy their belly shirts. Siebenburgen you say,, Burger King wins!"
5,For Pet Rats,"My two, female pet rats love these kookies. Even though the price is high for a treat, you get 40 kookies, so it evens out two less than fifty cents per treat that will each last at least five days per rodent. I had found small bags of 8ish kookies at a chain pet store for a dollar, but I think the individual sales have been discontinued as I can not find them anywhere anymore. :( I wish they would bring these back to the store as their own treats instead of only selling them when they are incorporated into a hanging device that makes it $13 more expensive. I would definitely buy these buy themselves in store to avoid shipping costs!"
2,Lose the alien insect!,"This CD started out with an okay combination of summer night sounds, then added the sound of an annoying insect (?) reminiscent of a high speed grinder. It began to grate on my nerves after a while. I found myself wishing whatever creature was producing that sound would be eaten by some other night creature. I also never heard the owl that was supposed to be hooting in the trees. I choose to play this CD on top of a ""forest stream"" recording on my hard disk, so the combination is rather pleasant, but ""Summer Nights"" alone is somewhat annoying."
1,How NOT to relax,"This is one of the worst environmental cds I have ever heard. The cover art promises the enjoyment of a silvery moon night in a forest. The sounds emitting from this cd are grating, irritating, and anything but relaxing. I felt like I was in an entire cave of crickets. My recommendation is to skip this one!"
1,Where's my shoe?,"This is supposed to be relaxing ambient sound, the sound of a summer night in the countryside. Unfortunately, this recording must have been made at ground level near a marsh. This CD is full of the sounds of cicadas, crickets, and other six legged denizens who set up a shrilling that can put your teeth on edge. And given that the loop of sound is only about 30 seconds long and is repeated for nearly an hour, you might find yourself reaching for the Raid.There are, to be sure, much better environmental recordings."
3,garage band,"I enjoyed this CD in spite of the obvious greeness of the band. Since I had just seen SMD live, I knew their style had progressed. I got ""Loud Wars"" at the same time, and the contrast between the two was amusing. Still, this album may showcase a garage band, but it is apparent that the the music has places to go."
5,Met My High Expectations,"I've been a big fan of Chris Gaffney's for quite some time which is why I purchased this CD the day it was released. Surprisingly enough, I wasn't immediately blown away the first time I listened to it. I thought, ""This was pretty good but not amazing."" The second time through, I started thinking that it was maybe better than I thought. By the third or fourth time through, I was hooked. There are some CD's out there that need to grow on you. This is one of them and it's worth the time to enjoy it.This is a great album thanks to a number of amazing songs. Walkin' on My Dreams and The Years That Got Away are two examples of songwriting that will last forever. While I've always thought that Gaffney's voice has been one of the best, I also enjoyed the songs where Dave Gonzales takes the lead.Finally, I also have the feeling that these songs will work even better in a live setting. Gaffney and Gonzales are great performers so get in line if they come to a venue near you."
2,"Great Live Band, Blah Studio Album","I saw these guys at Pickathon 2005 and they were fabulous, a great bar band. Chris Gaffney was a very charismatic live performer. Unfortunately, that charisma doesn't come across on this studio album and the whole thing sounds flat, both in sound and in inspiration. Were Chris Gaffney still alive, I would drive many miles to hear this band, but I would pass on this album."
3,Going somewhere,The music seems to be all over the map. Not sure what they weretrying to accomplish at any point. Not a bad CD but a mismatchedcompilation having a great version of the song Mental Revenge.
4,Good but alittle dissappointing,"I havn't been able to find much info on this dvd but decided to give it a try anyway, it contains many news reels and most of Marilyn's movie trailers, very standard footage here. Although it is enjoyable, I don't like that the trailers are mixed in with the news reels. I was also disappointed that the songs are not video clips from her movies they are only in audio. I liked the ""Marilyn at the movies dvd much better"" but if you don't already have MM's songs on cd you may also like this.."
4,A thick stew of serious technical content.,"I have this love-hate relationship with writers of technical books and their publishers. On the shelves, my eyes are drawn to the 500+ page tomes, but when I take a peek I am more often disappointed than elated with watered down, stretched out pap. Mr. Stewart breaks out from the pack with a seriously dense work that is nonetheless eminently readable.Don't be fooled by the tiny size of this book- it is huge. It covers its subject thoroughly and concisely. You can use it as a reference or a tutorial. It reads well and it works. Well done."
4,"All in all, a winner.","This book is a winner.That said I agree with the other reviewers including the first gentleman who seems to be quite turned off by the book. Personally I like the treatment of topics like BGP messages, AS-path/attrib, I-BGP and multihoming. I didnt quite get the BGP community concept thoroughly from the book.I like the 'practical' approach of the book and the way John has used the ISP examples to explain the concept. Come to think of it, its more of a BGP concept book. For any protocol's message type def, ofcourse, nothing compares to RFC.After reading the book, rfc1771 was a breeze and you can used this book as a handy reference to accompany the rfc."
4,Good Starters Book,"This is a good book for anyone wanting to learn a bit about BGP4, without reading boring RFC's -- However, if you plan on using BGP in your network enviroment, I would have to suggest that you get the ""Internet Routing Architectures"" by Bassam Halabi."
2,Was not impressed with this book...,"Very small book (115 pages). In his rush to overview TCP/IP in his intro, he failed to mention anything about ARP, I guess he deemed ARP a very unimportant protocol. If you are looking for a very in depth book for BGP. Look for ""Internet Routing Architectures"" Cisco Press. There is no comparison."
4,Wonderful Book,"This book accomplishes a great deal in 137 pages. You will learn what BGP is all about and the theory of how to deploy it. You will not learn command line interface syntax for any specific brand of router. However, understanding what the router is supposed to do first, usually helps in configuring it. :-)Enjoy!"
2,too dark,i bought this for my office and for a day room for children. It is too dark to see clearly or be of interest to children due to poor contrast
2,"Not the ""Nambe"" of Yesterday",Modern design fans may remember Nambe as I did ...the product of a small Santa Fe studio with a special alloy developed by a metallurgist from Los Alamos. When I ordered this platter I thought its high price could be justified by this heritage and I wanted to get something that was a craft product made in the United States.When the package arrived I immediately saw things had changed. The platter was made in India and had a poor finish with some visible scratches. From the tape on the packaging I think it is possible that someone else may have already returned this platter before. I also decided to return it. Be careful you may be getting it next!
3,An o.k. read,"After reading most of the Mandie series it was interesting to notice how little Mandie ages through the series. In this book 12year-old Mandie loses her father and is sent away by her mean stepmother. She is rescued by her father's friend, Uncle Ned, and taken to meet her real Uncle. With help from her new found friend,Polly, she manages to discover and uncover the mystery of a missing will. She meets with adventure wherever she goes, and somehow manages to live through the evil villians that pursue her."
1,Indian stereotypes abound,"Don't buy this book. ""Papoose"", ""squaw"", ""brave"", ""happy hunting ground"" -- I could not believe my ears as I listened to this book on tape in the car with my daughter. I had to keep stopping the tape and explain to my daughter that Indians don't really talk that way and why it is not appropriate to use those words. This book and its counterparts should be yanked from shelves and edited. I am appalled."
3,You can't get to Heaven by being good.,"This was a nice story but one big fault is that they teach you get to Heaven by being good, That is not true; you can only get there by being saved and asking Jesus to forgive you of your sins and take you to Heaven because he died on the cross for our sins because he is sinless."
4,Fun toy with many pieces,"We have pretty much all of the POTC toys that have been made! The Megabloks Black Pearl pirate ship has a lot of detail and a lot of pieces. We have two of these and they each took about 20 minutes to build. The ships are fragile so if your child likes to play rough they will come apart. My 7yo and 4yo boys love them anyway. They are rich in detail and my kids are into their imaginary play for hours with them.We also have the Zizzle Black Pearl pirate ship. It doesn't have nearly as many parts (not the ""Lego"" style like Megabloks) and is bigger. It has some cool electronic noises and trap doors, but is not as detailed as the Megabloks version. The Megabloks version has real sails too. The Zizzle ship has no action figures, so you have to order the 3"" figures separately (my kids just use their Megabloks figures).Their other favorites are the Megabloks Flying Dutchman (built a lot like the Black Pearl) and the Dead Man's Chest. These sets are a must have for the POTC fan!"
4,Fun-Filled,"This second movie with Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez as policemen on a stakeout adds Rosie O'Donnell to the fun. Good story, but not quite as funny as the first movie."
2,ANOTHER STAKEOUT,"While this is not as good as STAKEOUT, it's still very funny and I enjoyed watching it again in blu-ray."
4,Good Old School Movie,"I enjoy watching this movie. Funny, entertaining and i like it a lot!Even my 10yr old daughter likes watching it."
5,ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES EVER!!!!!!!!!,"Richard Dreyfuss and Emilo Estevez star in this halarious and action packed film, from the director of ""Nick of Time"". Two detectives(Dreyfuss and Estevez) are assigned to Steakout an escaped convict's ex girlfriend(thinking he'll return to her).While one the detectives are steaking out the ex girlfriend, the other detective falls in love with the ex girlfriend while he was in her house bugging the phone. This movie keeps on getting funnier and funnier until the halarious climax.Great direction and excellent action. 5 star +"
3,Did someone mention steak?,"Chris (Richard Dreyfuss) and Bill (Emilio Estevez) are back on ""another stakeout,"" trying to track down a mob witness. They are joined by Gina (Rosie O'Donnell), the assistant DA, and Chris & Bill's boss in this situation. They are ""renting"" a house from a judge (""Maximum Dave""), posing as father, mother, and son. The mob story is never fully explored, nor is the love story between Chris & Maria (remember her from Stakeout?). What is explored are wacky misunderstandings and little white lies a la Three's Company. Also dating this movie are references to Ren & Stimpy, Steven Seagal, and a rather sizeable reel-to-reel recorder. Director John Badham was going through a serious tilted camera angle phase. A marginal 3 stars. Beautiful print for a Mill Creek blu-ray release."
5,its out of this world,Another stake out is a movie which is out of this world.Before watching I wasnt in to comedies but now after watching it I totally changed my mind and now I know there is such a thing as an action comedy.
5,one of my favorite movies...,"O'Donnell, Dreyfuss and Estevez make a great team in this movie. It is an all around humorous flick. I think everyone will get a kick out of it.Dreyfuss and Estevez's characters team up with O'Donnell to stakeout a place in Washington State, after a witness for a murder came out of an explosion alive (while she was under protection with the police to testify in that trial for the murder). Now that she's missing and presumed alive, they've narrowed down to stakeout this couple in Washington-whom they think would be a place that the witness would run to hide from the murderer and/or police."
5,Real Wife Pleaser,"To put it bluntly.....this lamp is a real wife pleaser. I don't think it would be unfair or uncomplimentary of me to say that more women than men are usually more concerned with the esthetics, artistry, appearance, decor, etc. of a floor lamp. Having said that , after doing some research .....I decided to take a chance by purchasing this lamp for my wife who has worked in the fashion industry and also as an artist. I regard her as being asute and particular when it comes to picking out a lamp she likes. After showing here scores of pictures of lamps which she rejected, I ordered this lamp which turned out to be a real wife pleaser. This lamp was good enough to not only please my wife but for her to comment that it was much nicer than she thought it would be."
5,Incredibly suprised and delighted,"Not knowing what to expect from this band, I popped their new cd, Malice, into the player. The sounds that came forth were comfortably edgey and transcendal. Very few artists in the past two decades can make me want to hear their entire album again after the first go-through but SFE has been in heavy nonstop rotation on my player. Their deep sound, and swirling melodic beats makes for an excellent atmospheric choice in music. Especially if you like dancing to intelligent accompaniment...these guys are gooooood!It would be great if there were sound clips on this Amazon page so you can get a taste of SFE. But, until then, go to their site screamingforemily . c o m and watch their promo video... NICE!"
1,Satisfaction,It was not what i was expecting i was reading it to my son and he didn'tlike it i finished it myself not to my satisfaction
1,Deceived,"The product is 6"" but the diameter of a pencil. I had to buy regular cyalume light sticks that were the correct size and longer light time. The product is a toy; good to give out to kids on Holloween."
2,Boo hiss,"They work very bright for the first 30 to 60 mins. Then to a glow as bright as a candle (large candle). Afther maybe 8 to 9 hours the light drops down to a match glow . The 12 hour time is off by 3 to 4 hours. So not all glow sticks ,snaplights ... are made the same. Check glow times and be safe . Thank you"
2,Graphics are excellent but game sucks.,The creators of Mia's Reading Adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children's games. There is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child's effort. If you're looking to teach your pre-k/k child reading skills I'd recommend the Blue's Clues games instead. Any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did.
2,I am a teacher and a mom...,"The box said Mia's Big Adventure Collection has won over 90 awards. I went to the Mia website to see what awards it has won. Mia's big Adventure Collection has won a lot of parenting and toy awards! I didn't see any awards from educational organizations.My opinion:The software is not the easiest to use. I have a brand new Mac computer and the software sputtered, stopping when I tried to make Mia do something new. She had a hard time picking up objects. I thought the software was slow, too. It is as slow as the graphic software was from the early 1990s.I would not call this reading software. I call this a game. The talking portion of the software is quite simple. The actual phonics part of the software is contrived. It is just inserted into the story without a natural flow.I would never use this software at school. Home is a different story, especially since I bought it already. My son hasn't played with it yet."
2,Difficult to use,"I found this software very difficult to use. It does not have any ""Stop"" or ""Go Back"" button. The only way to exit an activity is to hit ""Esc"" button to exit the program and then start all over. When starting over, there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and I could not find a way to skip it."
4,Long intro. but child loves it and seems to be learning,"I did not think that introduction to the game was going to end. I thought that I may be able to skip it but no luck. Once into the game I believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills. Lastly, you have to hit the ""F"" keys and ""Esc"" to save and exit the game, not many program make you do that today.Overall, I feel that this was a good purchase and I would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program."
3,A little slow...,"My daughter played the game and she did enjoy it. She finished it over 3 short sessions, but would lose interest after about 30 minutes. Moving through the screens seems slow and awkward. Sometimes it seemed hard to figure where to go next and I was the one trying to figure it out.The animation was nice and you can increase the difficulty level. But it don't expect it to be very educational. It is a game with some light reading mini-games inserted awkwardly into the game play.If you want better educational software, I would pick up the Jumpstart Advanced games in the red boxes. Those games seem more geared to education and I felt they were worth the money. I would avoid the newer Jumpstart Advanced World games in the gold boxes as they require you to pay a subscription."
2,You get what you paid for,"This game looks great but lacks direction. You direct Mia to walk from room to room but along the way you are suppose click things. Which things you are suppose to click is not intuitive nor are there really any clues. For example, in one case you are in the attic of a house. There is stuff littered throughout the attic (bats, balls, boxes, toys, etc). Of the 10 things in the room only 2 or 3 actually do anything. In addition of the 2 or 3 things that do do something, only clicking very specific parts of those things do anything. So for example, if you are suppose to click the bat, only clicking one end of the bat results in a reaction. Often times when my daughter needed help, she ended up clicking every square inch of the screen hoping something would happen.The actual challenges aren't bad but there are few and like I said of above can be hard to find."
3,"useful as a game, but not to learn to read or help with the process","I thought this game would be useful to help my daughter start with the reading process, but that is not the case. As a game it's pretty entertaining, and it has very subtle clues that makes children have to think and look farther beyond. I would place the correct ages for this game between 6 and a half and eight and a half years old."
1,Very Morbid Storylines,"I bought two of the Mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed. class. I bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother (caregiver) passed away. The storyline of the game is that Mia has to SAVE her gravely ill grandmother. Then she gets MUGGED by a rat! I feel this is a little to noir for small children. The math game (which I am returning unopened) is about her house burning down, and if she could prevent it by going back through time. I feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects. I am returning both games!"
4,At last a book with good-looking teddy bears ...,"I knitted one of the bears (English gentleman bear) and two sets of clothing. The end product looks the same as the pictures - the bear and clothes are adorable. I had no problems with the patterns for they have been correctly written down. Because there are no diagrams/drawings of pieces with dimensions, I believe these knittings are for intermediate to advanced knitters. I can't wait to see my four year old granddaughter on Christmas day when she'll open up this gift!"
4,Teddy Bears by Debbie Bliss,"I have knitted the bear that is featured on the cover of this book. He is really cute, however, I found the instructions for sewing up the face a little difficult. I would like if Debbie Bliss would include some visual aid for working up the bears. There are some very cute patterns and I look forward to making another bear soon!"
4,Cute!,All of you Debbie Bliss people out there will love this book.....as you well know she always puts her all into her patterns and this book is no exception. Great for the teddy bear lover in all of us!
5,Toy Knits,"I thought this was a wonderful book. The illistrations alone made the book a great purchase, very inspiring."
2,Fragile and Tempermental,"I have had 3 of these Visor Deluxes over the last 3 years and all I can say is I hope my new Sony lasts longer. It sure works better than the Visor Deluxe. My advice, get a Palm or Sony. Forget Handspring until the quality goes up>>>"
4,Best bang for the buck!,"I purchased my Visor about 3 weeks ago after depending on a Daytimer and a Sharp 128kb electronic organizer. I compared the Visor to the Palm, and talked to several owners of each. The Visor is definitely the way to go. I have been very pleased with it so far and have no problems. The only glitch was the first time I attempted to synch up with my desktop, and the resulting glitch was my fault for being a little to eager (didn't read the book). I called customer support and they were extremely polite and helpful in walking me through the steps to correct everything. Since then it's been perfect! Anybody want to buy a Sharp Electronic Organizer?"
5,Better than DaVinci!,"I had tried the DaVinci PDA twice. The first one got destroyed by a co-worker, and the second got stolen with my purse.After two months without a PDA, I figured the DaVinci was bad luck. I saw the Visor on Amazon, and decided to give it a whirl.I've had my new PDA for 24 hours now, and I love it! The grafitti style of writing works 110% better then the DaVinci ever did, and the memory and flexibility of the Visor is great!I'm very happy, and went to handspring.com and ordered a custom case for storing this. I think it will increase my productivity in sales tremendously!"
3,Only Average - and poor support,"Originally I was thrilled with my Visor Deluxe - so much that we ordered my dad one. After 1 month, mine stopped synching. I had to reinstall all software and it still happens on occasion for no reason. Installing the software all over again fixes the problem for a while, but then it will fail again. ...Product also is bigger and harder to hold than Palm products - I have smaller hands and it's not a comfortable fit.Works fine when it works, but the tech support attitude makes me leery of buying from Handspring again, and they should support the operating system new computers are shipping with."
4,iDeal for Mac users!,"The Handspring Visor Deluxe is great for new iMac, iBook, G3, G4, Powerbook, iBook and other Mac computer with USB ports or USB cards! Many Palm products require that you purchase an [additional] Mac adapter in order to use the device with the Macintosh. But with the Visor, every one comes with a USB cradle which makes it easier for Mac users.And with the USB format comes faster speeds. The Universal Serial Bus can transfer data much faster than traditional serial connections thus HotSync operations are much faster. And unlike Palm devices, you don't have to download a seperate Mac Desktop application. It comes standard with the Visor.There are some trade-offs though. Visors can't sync email with their Macs without a third-party solution, (such as MultiMail Pro). But with greater expansion possibilities and a great price, the Handspring Visor is a must for any Mac user!"
5,It just works!,"The Palm Pilot is a success because it does what people want. It lets you take the critical information from your computer with you on the go. The Handspring Visor is especially great for those who use a Mac because of the built in USB interface.If you want freedom of choice, choose the Handspring and Palm OS as it does not box you in to using the the service... um I mean... OS from one company.The Visor is fast, works with a wide range of computers, is easy to use, and shows that you are not a lemming."
4,First-time owner of a handheld device,"I got my Visor from my girlfriend for a birthday present. It has to be the best handheld made. It's easy to use, really usefull and lightweight. I carry it in my pocket everywhere I go. And unless you need to see color pictures on a handheld, you don't need to get color. It's a great product that will last for years."
5,Great Deal,"I take my Visor everywhere with me. I can never remember a phone number, but now I dont have to. I link it up with my Outlook calendar, and I never miss an appointment. The only thing lacking here is a color screen, but try finding one anywhere near this price: It cant be done!"
2,My Experience...,"I was pleased with the PDA as it ""was"" my very first. I accidentally dropped the thing on the ground and it cracked in 3 places on the screen, making the unit unusable (unless you want to scroll through all your data with the buttons!). Are all PDA screens this sensitive?Also, I noticed that the battery life was extremely short. I didn't even use it regularly and it seemed like I was changing the batteries every 1-2 months."
5,HIGH TECH JUNKIE LOVES NEW VISOR,"Just purchsed the VISOR DELUXE, previously used PALM IIIxe but had a MULTITUDE OF PROBLEMS WITH THE PALM RECENTLY. When I unboxed the VISOR I was surprised at the slightly heavier build. The screen is smoother and the processor seems faster than the IIIxe. The OS is the same as the Palm, so there is no learing curve. The USB sync actually works, the problems I had with the competitor. The soft tip stylus is great. Have had the HANDSPRING one day and love it."
1,Died After Warranty.,"When I first used the Visor Deluxe I was impressed with it and had no problems but after 1 yr. 5 months on my last Hot Synced I now have a very ... paper weight, now after looking at the Handspring web site it will cost you ($$$) to talk to them and if they have to fix it it will cost you ($$$), now I have just looked and I can buy a Palm 105m for ($$$) and the only thing I will lose is the springboard which to me is no big deal, but of course maybe I will go back to the tried a true way of the old Day Planner, at least with that the only thing that will break is the pencil."
4,"Everything that I expected, but...","Been using the Visor for a month now, and it has been everything that I hoped it would be. My only complain is that she's (yes, it's a girl. Any problem with that ;-) a battery guzzler!!! I received my visor on the 2nd. of February and I had to change batteries last thursday the 15th.! Let's hope that these last a bit longer. Maybe it was just me playing a lot with her, otherwise, these little babies were born to rock!"
3,Don't Even Bother,"This thing is a joke. I don't have the Palm, but wish I did--this little item sucked up all my important data and held it for two months during which I oohed and ahhh'd and was terribly impressed at the technology. Then it crashed. Gave me an error message out of the blue, and the only way to get it going again was to re-boot--not the ""soft"" reboot, but the way that caused it to delete all, and I do mean ALL-- of the information. The handspring support folks seemed quite unconcerned; it happens frequently. My advice: Forewarned is forearmed. This is an expensive toy, but not to be trusted with any of your important data."
5,WHICH ONE TO BUY - HELP?!?!?!?,"Hi! I'm trying to decide between the Handspring or Palm IIIxe. Any suggestions or helpful info would be greatly appreciated. What were some deciding factors for you? Thanks alot!! I really like the green one - how does it look in ""real life""!"
5,Have to Have It,"Received one as a gift two months ago, returned it before traveling to a tradeshow, missed it terribly. Bought another one the day I came home. Ability to sync Outlook Express to the Visor, work computer, home computer, and laptop is GREAT. And, I have something to read on the road."
2,Unreliable,"I have had my VDx for about 15 months. I used it daily, but would occasionally get ""Fatal error"" messages which required a hard reset and the loss of my most recent data. Finally my original unit died. I called customer service [for Handspring],which is NOT an 800 number and waited 15 minutes to get through. They sent me a replacement ""refurbished"" unit which was defective. I then went through the same procedure on the phone and amazingly got another defective unit!I have had it with Handspring and will look elsewhere for my next PDA."
3,A Couple Notable Flaws,"The unit itself works fine as would be expected, though i do have to reset it a lot. If I had to do it over again, probably for about the same price I would go with the Palm V. The Handspring has two problems:1- the AAA batteries. They run out about once a month, which means I have to make sure there is a stock on hand. There is really no excuse for not having rechargables in a product like this. A waste and an inconvenience.2- the size. The unit has passed that point where you can just stick it in your pocket and forget about it. The expansion port is a nice idea, but since realistically i will never use it, it just means extra bulk. Also, since i dont use it for email, 2MB is probably enough."
4,A great product...,"But I wish I had waited a couple of months before buying mine. Shortly after purchase, Handspring came out with their Platinum version that I would have purchased instead.For the Visor Deluxe itself, I have no complaints at all. I prefer the Handspring over the Palm, mostly due to its expansion slot. They both run the same software, but I feel the functionality of the Handspring makes it a winner.I also purchased a leather case that attaches to my belt ... so I don't have to worry about it taking up space in my already overcrowded pockets."
4,To Visor or Not To Visor,I recently received a Handspring Visor Deluxe as a gift and have to say that I am very pleased. I find it quite useful as a dayplanner as well as an entertainment tool. I am hoping to begin using it for email shortly.I would definitely recommend this product b/c of the expansion capablilities and how compatible it is with palm software (it is based on a palm os).Definitely get it if you are in the market for one.
2,Why is this gadget crashing after 2 days?!,"Initially loved it. Used for 2 days. I was playing Tiger Woods 2001 golf and a ""fatal error"" message popped up. The screen is so dark now that I can't read it. Even after removing the game and restarting the device, the clarity is gone. I'm returning it today. Very disappointed. Not sure what to buy now."
2,1 shortcoming only,"Cons:Defect: the backlight does not work.Shortcoming: has Palm OS 3.1, an early version for Handspring Visors.Neutral:(expedited) Shipping time: 5 daysPros:PricePS: Vendor customer support contacted me and provided a replacement unit with a working backlight, free of additional charge :)"
2,"Good story, ditch the bimbo","I would have given this book at least 4 stars but Mr. Bond's inclusion of a unnecessary romance with the female HRT leader brought it down by 2. The romance angle was shallow, unnecesarry and only there to appease the mentally deficient of his readers. Look at his previous 3 books, excellent books with no Harlequin romance crap dropped in for filler.I am very disappointed, this book could have been great."
4,a very solid read,"I've read all of Larry Bond's books. I thought Vortex was his best, but it's still a very good read that keeps you turning the pages."
3,Worth Reading,The underlying plot is exciting and holds ones attention as to some terrible possibilities. I downgraded the book because of the disappointment in the conclusion. The author seemed to just quite the plot as if he was tired of writing so he brought it to a quick and disappointing conclusion.
2,The ending stinks,"Mr. Bond's past books have been riveting. This one does not match up. The first 450 pages were well written (a little short on character development, but not bad), however, the main characters actions at the end ARE NOT BELIEVABLE. Additionally, why write such a flowing book and wrap it all up in 20 pages. The ending could really have been expanded upon and made much more thrilling. Only 2 stars, which means slightly below average."
2,Best Argument for Anonymous Remailers Yet,"I was disappointed: you never know why the bad guy's the bad guy, there were far too many points of view (many characters are introduced only to be killed on that page or on the next) and the main point the book made, in my opinion, is that if you're planning a terrorist attack, at least use an anonymous remailer when you send your messages to the troops over a commercial email service--or at least keep don't keep your private key on your hard drive"
3,Not as good as his previous books.,"While I enjoyed the book, I did not feel that it reached the same level as Cauldron or Vortex."
3,A Mild Disappointment,In comparison to his earlier books this one was a bit disappointing. Larry go back to the large war novels!
5,a fascinating read,Sucks you in.. a read it nonstop and finished it in 2 days.. great detail. You won't be able to put it down.
4,No testimonials of cured patients?,"I am a little disappointed that there is no interview with any recovered patients or any testimonials that convinced people that ther CURE is obtained by any real people. No doubts the video presented many truth and facts but ultimately if I want to convince any of my cancer friends to give alternative a good look or try, they must be convinced that there are people who did it and survived, this is lacking in the video here."
1,Nothing new here,"The video gives advice already well known to most cancer suffers who use alternative treatments such as eat organic raw vegetables, exercise, don't eat sugar or processed food etc.Go to a doctor in Denmark.Get hyperbaric treatments.Take supplements. They don't tell you all the ones to take but a few days later I got emails for miracle supplements. They say take lots of vitamin C.I paid for a video that gave me limited information they got a bunch of emails from others seling cancer cures. One was in this video. He was a retired colonel.This was a waste of money and now I'm on a list with some probably charlatans sending me cancer cures.This video doesn't give you specific cures for your cancer only they tell you there is a cure somewhere and to follow some general advice.I wish I could send it back for a refund."
2,Didn't grab me!,"I had difficult time getting into this book, and unfortunately, did not finish it. Maybe I was not in right frame of mind for the book."
5,Take a Glorious Ride on The River,"An exquisite, uplifting recording that will surely stir the soul. Monty and John Clayton navigate the listener on a spiritual journey to truth and happiness. A must for the collection."
3,"An entertaining romp in the Black Company universe, but which cuts some corners in terms of characterization and plot","An enjoyable and dark read, but I'm not sure I was left convinced by the characterization of Raven (not as three dimensional as in previous books), Philodendron Case (didn't match the nervous kid we previously met), and Smeds Stahl (transformation a la Marron Shed a bit repetitive). Still, it was a highly engaging read and brought the Book of the North to a nice close. Nota bene: those who haven't read the preceding books in this series will want to check them out first."
5,A side story...,in parallel with the Company series. It's good though it can be a bit confusing in some spots...
2,"A good start, but finishes weak","I had high expectations of this book but was let down. The author starts on the right foot but loses momentum. I got to the middle of the book and felt that the only way to live a congruent life is to leave my job and become a monk! His tone and attitude toward work are VERY negative. The author is also very ""preachy"". He is pretentious and writes in ""holier that thou"" language. Awakening Corporate Soul is much better."
2,An interesting premise that doesn't deliver,"The book jacket described this tale of several generations of an eccentric Vermont family as ""darkly comic"" and hinted at a clan whose problems tended toward the amusingly morbid, like an inherited tendancy towards spontaneous combustion. While Wilbur makes a decent stab at magical realism and creates some interesting characters, the bittersweet story never quite comes together and engages us. All but a few of the characters are intriguing sketches that leave you wishing they were more complete, because the ideas behind them are so promising. The meandering plot picks up steam in the last few chapters, if you hang in there that long."
5,Good drive for the Money,"I have 2 of these in my media center pc and i have no complaints, they are quiet, and are quick. i havent had any trouble with them and ive had em for about 1year. and the PC is on every day and only gets rebooted every week or so."
4,Western Digital 160GB EIDE internal hard drive,I bought this item to upgrade my custom-built PC and have been very happy with it. It came with easy-to-follow instructions and software for mounting and formatting the unit. The price was very reasonable and delivery from Amazon was good. I expected to have problems re-activating my Windows operating system but that went without a hitch. IDE drives have been overtaken by SATA because of technology advances. I did not want to replace other modules in my computer so this was a perfect choice for me.
5,GOOD STORAGE AT A GOOD PRICE,"I ordered this drive to fix a system for my neighbor that had crashed, he told me that this drive actually works much better and faster than the old one, He must not have filled it with clutter yet! Other than that great drive, no problems installing it, worked like a charm."
1,"Crashed 3 times, lost a LOT of data","I bought this hard drive, and it crashed after a week. Sent it back to WD with the warrentee, got a new hard drive. That one crashed after 2 months. Got another new one, and that one crashed in less than 1 month. I have lost a LOT of data due to Western Digital's faulty hardware, and I STRONGLY advise that you look to some other hard drive service, do NOT buy from western digital!ps. WD will refuse to do any sory of data recovery on their crashed drives, and the services they recomend will cost more than 10x what the hard drives cost."
1,"Lack of Support, Drives fail","Lack of Support for Failed Drivesby neever, Dec 07 '05Western Digital will not support your hard drive WHEN it fails. On November 16, 2004, I bought a 250GB hard drive. Three months later in February, 2005, I had to return it for a replacement due to a hard failure. Now, this replacement drive too has failed as well after only eight months.I went through two Western Digital drives in a year due to no fault of my own and the hard drive failed just six days after the warranty expiration. I requested a replacement from Western Digital and they completely ignored me.Buy at your own risk.Pros:NoneCons:Lack of Support Drives fail"
2,"Pay attention to your own characters, Disney!","The doll is short and stumpy, not the svelte look the character is known for. Her outfit is all wrong, and resembles nothing of the Pixie Hollow culture the books spent so much time developing. Also, this fairy is not supposed to have wings. She's a special, important character for that fact, and yet they gave her wings. Why?"
2,Uuuughhh,Colleges and Universities cut deals with publishers to publish new editions every year. The Bedford Reader is among the worst. They have dozens of editions and over a three year period they rotate essays every year so that the used books are useless. This is a waste of trees and should be stopped.
5,Bedford Reader,This was required for a College credited High School class. The book received was in great condition.
1,wow,"I ordered this book in september and still didnt recieve it after about a month and a half, i ended up getting my money back and just forgetting about it. It was for my college english class and cost me alot of participation time. I won't order anything from these guys again."
5,The Best I've Ever Seen,"I was required to get this book for an Intermediate Composition course in college and it has to be the best college textbook I have ever had. First there is a wide variety of stories to choose from and at least one will appeal to everyone. Even though it is a educational textbook I still read it in my leisure time, as well."
2,disappointed in the book contents,"I was pleased with the condition of the book, but disappointed in the book itself. Not what I was thinking it was."
3,"Not great, but some fantastic guitar","Not quite as good as Freedom at Point Zero or Earth, but one person stands out on this album: Craig Chaquico. He is one of the most underrated guitarists of the last 30 years and boy does he shine. The lead harmonies on Be My Lady are absolutely unbelievable! Some of the best guitar work I have ever heard. Pete Sears, David Freiberg and Craig Chaquico emerge as the leaders on this album as Grace Slick and Kantner truly take a back seat. If you were old enough to remember some of the MTV videos from this album, you were lucky. They were quite good."
5,Just whaT I expected!,Awesome! Brought me back to my younger years! Great music at a great price! recommend to all my friends! Get it!
4,The title track says it all,"The year: 1982. Winds Of Change - an appropriate title and song, for times were changing and fast. You could feel it in the air. Listen to the lyrics - they apply even more so in today's world. Also check out Be My Lady - a true masterpiece ballad.This time period of Jefferson Starship is my favorite, starting in 1979 with Freedom At Point Zero and continuing with Modern Times, Winds Of Change, then Nuclear Furniture. I really enjoy Mickey Thomas on vocals; moreover, any duet by Mickey and Grace Slick on vocals has a magic to it that is seldom duplicated (Winds Of Change, Nothing's Gonna Stop Us, et al)"
5,Getting Started....,"The Table Saw Book was a great book to read as I began to get into doing some basic woodworking. It was extremely clear and an easy read. However, I found the information very good and on a level that I could understand. I would recommend to anyone who is just getting started in woodworking to read this book first. You will find that you refer back to it time and again."
2,Moderately disappointing,"I bought this book based on other customer reviews. I was disappointed. In my opinion it is only somewhat useful if you are a rank amateur and need advice buying your very first table saw. If you are looking for detailed advice and hints on use and operation, this book falls far short.I don't doubt that Mr. Mehler is a well qualified expert, but as a general table saw manual, he does not give me the information I wanted.As an example of a work that really fills the bill of a well written tool selection guide and manual, check out ""Woodworking With the Router"" by Hylton and Matlack for the American Woodworker series from Reader's Digest Books.I don't know what to suggest instead of this book except perhaps Taunton's Complete Illustrated Guide to Using Woodworking Tools. It is much more expensive, but well worth it and covers the entire spectrum of woodworking tools."
2,Not Taunton's Very Best,"Taunton, publisher of Fine Woodworking, usually publishes books that are well above the mark as hobbiest books go. Woodworking Basics and the Bandsaw Book are great examples of generalist books or tool books that hit way above the mark.Unfortunately, The Table Saw Book by Kelly Mehler is one of the few books that I have returned. My chief concern is value. While giving a good basic overview of tool use, the book does not give a good value in terms of more advanced techniques. When compared against the Taunton Book, ""The Bandsaw Book"", the difference is clear. This is one of few books purchased from Amazon that I have actually returned. While not a bad book, you should look to more comprehensive books on the market."
4,Cut It Out! Every table saw user should read this book.,"I was a self-started on the table saw. I took-off and learned as I went. That is, I learned every nasty, unsafe method possible. I was not a smart worker but didn't know it. That's where Mr. Mehler came in. Not only does his book instruct the reader how to cut cleaner and be more productive, he pushes safety all through the book. Because of Kelly (can I call him Kelly?), I have a cross-cut sled, a zero-tolerant throat plate, and two grip-tites. I have not taken another single kick-back to the head or lost another finger in over a year!"
3,Table saw book,"The book is written clearly. The text and accompanying figures are, in themselves, excellent. However, it spends too much space going over material. The whole book could have been compressed. The author has a clear preference for European saws, which may indeed be a valid preference. However, it would have been useful to go through the various saws, maker by maker, and compare them. Instead, he merely cites his preferences for the saw features, without mentioning which saws he is referring to. In summary, I learned quite a lot, but needed to look elsewhere to find answers about the products on the market."
5,Great book -- tons of useful information.,"I bought this book with a serious table saw purchase in the next 12 months in mind. I thought that I should learn as much as I could, so I hopefully wind up with what I want and with a quality unit. This book is exactly what I was looking for -- everything is here. Explanations of different designs, pros/cons, and all of the things one should consider when looking for a saw. After reading the first few chapters, I realize that spending a little more than I originally planned would probably save me money and grief later down the road. An excellent book, and worth reading if you are looking for or already own a table saw."
3,Table Saw Book,"While the box covers the basics of a table saw, I was expecting a broader section on the design of jigs for use with a table saw. The jigs provided, however, are the basic ones commonly used."
3,Get The Video,"The book is ok, but it mainly rehashes what has been done in the video. The Cliffe book Table Saw Techniques is much more detailed. The Tolpin book is pretty good.You must however get the video companion to this book. Kelly is truly a master at what he does and explanations are clear and well thought out. I have run the video at least 8 times so far."
5,Great for a brand new woodworker,"I'm bought this book based on several recommendations from other woodworkers. I'm very happy now that I have. It covers a lot of ground that is probably ""common sense"" to a seasoned woodworker, but to a beginner is priceless information. Some of the area's that were important to me are the safety portion and the table-saw setup. I've recently purchased a table-saw and now I feel I have enough knowledge to get it setup and tuned up properly, and how to use it safely.I definately recommend it to novice woodworkers."
1,What More Could You Want,I'm another one of those that took shop in school and until been unable to assemble a home shop. This is a great reference and brush up on safety. I find it helpful as I enter the market for a table saw.
1,Don't dip a toe into this lake,"This CD is really terrible. Complete silence and then every once in awhile a splashing sound that sounds like someone just flushed a backed up toilet. Then you are treated to another 20 minutes of silence (which, by the end, you are grateful for). Stay away!"
4,Horse people will laugh and laugh,"This book is a quick and spritely read, and in spite of the implausibiltiy of the plot I enjoyed it a lot because I found the author's descriptions of horse people and riding to be so spot-on. If you have participated in the world of riding (hunter/jumper/dressage) you will recognize the types of people lampooned here. Also, I found the author's descriptions of the physical and emotional 'feel' of riding to be among the most accurate I have encountered. Towards the end of the book, when the main character mounts a horse that she knows that she really has no business getting on, and then proceeds to get run away with, I was right in the saddle with her, vividly reliving similar experiences of my own. I could only laugh (in a pained way) while reading it. I definately recommend this book to any horse person because you will probably like it for the same reasons that I did."
5,You will laugh out loud!,"This book is hilarious and one of my all time favorites. If you ride, you must read it!"
5,My Favorite Book!!,I RECENTLY READ THIS BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY AND IT IS THE BEST! IT HAS MANY SURPRIZING TWISTS AND IT IS HILARIOUS! Just when you thought it was a lull....
2,poorly written,"i seem to be the lone dissenter here but i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they were very into horses. sure it's a light read, if by ""light"" you mean trifling & unbelieveable yet still completely predictable. this book tried way too hard to be click-lit witty &, as a result, all the dialog feels forced & false. plot-wise, there are many absurdist elements yet all of them culminate in trite, predicatable ways. the most compelling parts involved the descriptions of the horses & their personalities, & i'm not even a horse person. perhaps this shows that the author is, since she was clearly more comfortable writing those passages."
4,funny & quirky,"This is a really funny and witty book, surprisingly well-written. Those who hated it took it much too seriously!"
1,Unsubstantial fluff,"I was expecting this book to be quality entertainment judging by the reviews from many readers on a popular horse-related web board. I was sadly disappointed due to the stereotyped, poorly-developed characters and weakly-strung plot. This book professes to be a humorous farce, and the first chapters had me enticed. However, too many ridiculous scenes and caricatured main characters put me off. Singer's best passages are those pertaining to the horse's personalities, as someone else mentioned. Those scenes that capture the frustration, excitement, and mental game of competitive riding are worthwhile. Overall, this book failed to keep my interest."
3,fun,"this book was a fun light read, however it had some language and story lines that i deem inappropriate. definitely do NOT get this for your horse loving daughter, this book is for grown ups."
5,An entertaining read!,"A book hasn't made me laugh so hard in a long time! Although this novel focuses on the dressage world, it doesn't bury you in terminology. As a western rider, I was still able to read this book and enjoy it without feeling lost. Even those who aren't of the ""horsey persuasion"" will enjoy this book. The horsey setting almost becomes secondary to the other plot lines in the book. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who loves horses, or is just looking for a great laugh."
4,Good Ambiant Goth Black Metal,"This is a great release from Summoning. it has all the elements of a good ambient, black metal feel. the Keyboards are very intense and almost bring a vamperic feel to the whole album. Great vocals as far as black metal goes as well. A good solid release from Summoning. Not a recommandation if you are not looking for a more goth sound to black metal but if you are this would be a great recommandation for you."
3,NOT Tolkien metal,"This album is a very well produced attempt by Summoning to break away from their well established connection with Tolkien(the main reason I started listening to them), so if you're looking for something which is in tune with Middle-Earth, look elsewhere; this album is based upon the poetry of Robert Frost. The album is about the same as their others instrumentally, but the lyrics(my main concern) derive wildly from their previous masterpieces. Good attempt, Summoning, but at this point your most loyal fanbase is made up of Tolkienites. Don't ruin it."
4,Where Hope and Daylight Die,"Silenius and Protector are the most underrated musicians in the black metal scene. Sure, there are a lot of keyboards and little guitars on this album, but it does not disappoint. Many of these songs take me back to the forests of old, elves dancing and singing, and dwarves digging in the mountains. ""The Rotting Horse on the Deadly ground"" makes me think of the great battle of Minas Tirith, winged Nazgul swooping down and taking men's lives with ease. This album deserves 4 1/2 stars, not four."
4,One of their more professional works,"To my mind, this is more repetitive than previous attempts from Summoning, but shows the poise and refinement of ""Nightshade Forests"" taken to new heights of articulation. Longer songs based around melodies interacting through layers of keyboards, guitars and whisper-hissed vocals, these works emphasize a return to motifs interlocked with rhythm in such a way to create a trancelike state of both reality suspension and inner space exploration. Cosmic black metal."
4,A post-ROTK release book review,"I wanted to review this book for people who have already seen the theatrical edition of Return of the King. The biggest thing that this photo guide adds is a major clue into what may be in the extended edition DVD of Return of the King, which will be released sometime in the fall of 2004. For example, there are some wonderful pictures of Sam and Frodo, and of Pippin and Merry, that are not in the final theatrical cut of the film, and therefore, it seems that we can expect these in the extended cut. The only criticism I have is simply that, other than these new pictures, it is of course a rehashing of the story, written somewhat like a children's book. But, like I said, it is worth it for the new photos."
3,short but enlightening,"Although the DVD is only 38 min long and probably not worth the cost of a dvd, the concepts regarding vibration through words to change 'feelings' is pretty amazing. Worth a watch, but should be longer to charge as a normal dvd. WIth the cheap cost of DVD's this should be included with one of his books."
5,For many's viewing pleasure ...,"I did not buy this book but heard many good observations about this book. I browsed around in the book stores about this book. The pictures are fasinating. That just shows us the power of human emotions. Imagine. The most dominant substance of humans and animals' bodies is actually water. So, the research the author has is an interesting observation. If we learn how to stir our emotions effectively returning ourselves to love, appreciation, gentle and kindness, it creates a nice, harmonic being inside ourselves and this emotional energy will spread over to everyone else around us too (Look. If emotional energy can make such an impact to water, imagine how impressive and powerful it could be when we show love, appreciation and kindness to ourselves and others)."
5,Excellent Material,"I had a wonderful information through the DVD. I have the book but have not read it, the DVD helped me gain knowledge quickly, saved me time also. It is a must watch DVD, my kids have not read the book but watched the DVD. It has helped my family understand the power in positive words to people,places and things."
5,A PERFECT REMINDER HOW IMPORTANT WATER IS......,"It is a perfect reminder of how important water is for us as humans, animals and the earth. I had a feeling after the DVD that I know nothing of the healing power of water. It showed in a simple way how powerful the humans thoughts are and how carefull we should be with them.Personely I think this is a perfect DVD for families and an inspiration to make some of the experiments at home."
2,personal opinion,"I have the book and like it much better, more pictures and info.Very disappointed in the video. Did not like the Japanesee language and hard to read subtitiles."
2,Water Crystals in motion,Shorter than I expected (only 38 min.) Mostly in Japanese with subtitles. Not what I was expecting for the price.
3,Depend on Your Perspective,"Incredible images of ice crystals, but source attribution can be a stretch. One must be willing to agree that ice patterns are formed as the result of ""thought"". Doubt certainly arises regarding ability to affect objects using only thought. If this is true, I would have long ago won the lottery."
1,"New Age Theme, but Old Worn Out Message","Harmless enough video with a fairly insipid message. If you are a die hard New-Age junkie you will like this video. If you are looking to enlighten yourself with some fresh and reasonable debate ammo for your not so enthusiastic New Age friends and family, this falls way short of filling that bill.Pretty pictures and music to go with it, but can't recommend this one unless you can find it at a garage sale for about a buck."
3,Water Crystals in Motion- Messages From Water,Interesting science but japanese language made it somewhat annoying.
1,Ludicrous!,This DVD was probably the stupidest thing I have ever watched. There is not a shred of science or scientific method anywhere in this production. The water crystals are pretty ;-) but everything else about this production is complete nonsense.
3,New translation lacks the clarity of Kemp Smith classic.,"This new translation claims that it captures Kant's style better than previous translations, while also correcting certain errors in the older efforts. However, a comparison of this translation with Norman Kemp Smith's suggests that there were very few errors to correct. More significantly, this translation claims that it captures Kant's prose style better than Kemp Smith. It is not explained why this was worth doing -- and the result is to make Kant even more dense than he already is. The notes mainly refer the reader to Kant's collected notes, and so provide little immediate assistance, unless you're writing a book on Kant."
2,Where's the Reason in the Critique,"It would have been nice had Kant used reason in his critique of reason, had used logic to disprove logic, and had used more that linquistics to make his points."
1,Kant was wrong.,"David Hume's problem is still left unresolved. He just sweeps it under the rug. Very, very, very disappointing outing by Mr. Kant. Let's hope his next offering is better."
1,"Kant is obsolete, and should be treated as such","Kant once stated his discovery of Hume awoke him from a dogmatic slumber; reading Kant, one wonders if it truly had. Although given credit for discovering the limits of reason in providing metaphysical truths, subsequently making metaphysics a joke among European intellectuals, he nevertheless refused to admit the absurdity of many metapysical concepts -- most importantly God and the existence and immortality of the soul. Kant's genius was in convincing others that he had filtered out metaphysics from reason, and thereby reached an unprecedented objectivity. The truth is that his philosophy is no less metaphysical, and therefore no less without foundation, than that of the rationalists he succeeded. It would take the appearance of Nietzsche almost a century later for Europe and the world to see Kant for what he really is."
1,Mr. Kant should make a few more distinctions,"I know that Mr Kant thinks that he's the greatest thing since sliced bread but really, he should try to write at above a third grade level if he wants to be taken seriously..."
3,A true classic,"First and perhaps foremost, the English translation is a good deal more manageable than the German original (which is not saying terribly much).There can be no doubt that this work is a keystone of Western philosophy and as such it most certainly deserves our attention, but one must also be aware that the argument and presentation is far from optimal. Unless one is truly dedicated to Kant, philosophy in general or the history of Western thought I would find it hard to recommend the actual text of the ""The Critique of Pure Reason"" over the much more lucid summaries of Kant's ideas that are readily available."
4,Dear Lord,"My mind was blown, yet nearly fried, by this massive work of philosophical critique, It was a great read, going into the Problem of Knowledge, and what reason can be. Hard read, but Great result."
4,Lost in translation,"This is a fine English translation of Kant's seminal philosophical work. However, be warned, this work is *much funnier* in the original German. Regrettably, many of Kant's infamous puns and one-liners just don't translate. As such, this influential work -- which, to any native speaking German, would be a pleasure to browse through at a beachside café -- becomes a dense and challenging work that English readers may wish to avoid in favor of lighter fare, such as Bertrand Russell's effervescent masterwork, Principia Mathematica."
2,This book is only for hardcore philosophers,"Even a summary of Kant is never easy to read. The unedited real thing is extremely difficult for anyone not (a) totally enthusiastic, (b) extremely familiar with philosophical concepts, and (c) very very smart. Because I didn't fall in any of the above categories (being, in Kant's words, a ""common man of the commonest intelligence""), Kant's critique was lost of me. My heart goes out to those, like me, who are required to read it."
3,important and unreadable,"Despite the earth-shaking importance of Kant for the world of thought, I am in complete disagreement with the idea that a style of writing is obscure because it deals with deep or complex subjects. Einstein once said that he could explain relativity to an uneducated barmaid-- and was famous for the clarity with which he educated nonscientists. One could cite many examples in the philosophical world as well (Camus, William James, etc.)...writing this bad isn't so for technical reasons, but for stylistic and egotistic ones. You're better off reading someone else's commentary on Kant."
5,Beautiful translation of a beautiful work,"Pluhar's translation is wonderful. The extensive annotation makes the whole work perfectly clear, offering alternative translations and pointing out the technical German vocabulary (so essential to understanding Kant). The work flows beautifully, and though the material was dense, I could hardly put it down at times. If you're just starting Kant, do not start here. I'd suggest the excellent series by W.T. Jones called A History of Western Philosophy (specifically volume four). Read and reread it. Understand the basics about Kant, then, when you have the proper grounding, go on to the Critique. It will reward careful study."
3,Not the industry standard,"Those who are, or who are planning to be, students of Kant should know that professionals regard the Meiklejohn translation of the Critique of Pure Reason as substandard. Translations must compromise, but this one compromises too much. In places it shows serious misunderstandings of Kant's intent. The ""classic"" standard is Norman Kemp Smith's translation, and the new standard is the Cambridge Edition translation by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood. Even undergraduates should be given excerpts from these latter texts."
4,Rate the BOOK not the arguments!,"It amazes me how many of the previous reviewers failed to review the quality of the book (translation, print, etc), but rather insisted on offering sophomoric critiques of Kant's arguments. No one cares what YOU think about Kant. If one day YOU make even a fraction of a contribution to the field of philosophy as Kant has, then and ONLY then, may your opinion be considered important to the discussion. Any idiot can have an opinion. It is the task of scholars to first UNDERSTAND. Save the opinions of Kant's arguments for your dissertation.Now for my review:I gave 4 Stars mainly for what I felt were a few discrepancies or at least ambiguities when compared to the German text. As for English translations, I personally prefer the translation by James Creed Meredith. Nevertheless, it is always helpful to have several translations for comparison."
5,This is a must read book for every person. I think millions of reviews have been done about it: My review is you must read this.,"Kant explores the nature of reason, knowledge and established his ""philosophy"" that has dominated western civilization since then to our days."
2,insincere,"I don't like this CD at all. They sound smug, insincere, full of themselves, showing off.Their intonation is great, their talent is great, and a few moments are striking for their musicality, but the overall impression is unpleasant, as though the listener is being used somehow."
3,Mixed Bag,"Felo proved to be a life save on multiple occasions during my job. Very good construction (with one exception, later on), quality and attention to details. Bits are also very high quality.Only con in my opinion is cover for additional bits can opened a bit too easy while using the tool.Update: After about a year (as I suspected before)the cover of container with extra bits broke off (one of teeth which held it in place) and made use of this handle unusable, however Felo bits still in use and going strong. Two stars reduced for bad design"
4,Classic Rock,One of Zeppelins best. Led Zep was one of the best bands of the 70's. It is hard to pin down any one thing. I Recomend buying at least the first 6 anyways.
4,Little Disappointed,"Product showed up on time but with broken jewel case. Also, I was a little disappointed to find out this was a copy originally released in Argentina. CD quality is great but would like to have known that ahead of time..."
4,Dirty blues with a heavy dose of rock,"""Led Zeppelin II"" is a heavy dose of blues and hard rock; not too disimlar from their debut, albeit not quite as bluesey overall.There's lots of great moments on here, really. The raucous, sexy strut of ""Whole Lotta Love"" is a major highlight to kick off the album. Certainly one of Zep's most memorable rockers.""What Is and What Should Never Be"" explores soft/loud dynamics nicely, and ""Thank You"" is one of their most genuine, beautiful love ballads.""Moby Dick"" isn't so much a song as a showcase for Bonzo's wicked drum solo. And ""Bring It On Home"" closes the album in a very bluesey fashion.Other highlights include the sleazy blues/rocker ""The Lemon Song"", the bitter ""Heartbreaker"", and the folksy rocker ""Ramble On"" (first evidence of Robert Plant's love of JRR Tolkien).Like their debut album, ""Led Zeppelin II"" has a gritty, rockin' blues feel throughout. It's not their best, but you really can't go wrong with it either."
3,Whole Lotta Riffs,"Led Zep II is an innovative studio album with Page & Jones at the top of their studio wizardry. The album kicks off with the famous redundant Whole Lotta Love riff and continues through the over indulgent psycedelic bridge one is truly glad when this song ends. What is & What Should Never Be is definitely the album highlight with Zep firing on all cylinders. The bluesy Lemon Song and the poppy Thank You follows. The old war horse combo Heartbreaker/Living Loving Maid keep the album rocking and Page seems like he has riffs to burn. From here the album cools off with Plant's Hobbit influenced wispy Ramble On. the lame space filler Moby Dick instumental follows. The album closes with another highlight ""Bring it On Home"" a rockin blues tribute. Although Zep's creativity showed this album the music sounds lifted like a Lenny Kravitz album."
1,Great song - don't buy from Amazon,"They are now forcing you to use their crappy ""Amazon MP3 Download software"" It doesn't work on my computer, so now I 1) don't have my music, 2) am out the cost of the album, 3) find out they won't let you buy the album any other way for some silly reason.Try a different website."
3,JUST HEARD THIS ONE SONG ON THE RADIO,"I've just heard a song on 107.7 The Bone San Francisco, and itwas called ""The Lemon Song"", it was a song that I've heard onthe football DVD called ""Glory Days"". It's a good song first ofall. I'm just waiting to get it I guess. Then I'm gonna makea football CD."
2,Seriously overrated,Another violently average album from arguably the most overrated band of all time. Don't believe all the hype about this band. They're like U2 ; a few good songs but the rest is just nothing special. The singing is just awful.
2,awesome cd,I love this cd so much it is so much better than the other ones the other cds would have gotten one star. You are such a awesome band like for my grandma. I love your music only if I'm so drunk I can't hear it anyways. My favorite song is a whole lot of love that song rocks except i was drunk then too.
3,Uhhh...okay,"The only good songs on this album are ""Whole Lotta Love,"" ""What is and What Should Never Be,"" which are both on the EARLY DAYS compilation, ""Moby Dick,"" and the ""Heartbreaker""/""Living Loving Maid"" medley.""Moby Dick"" has a three-minute drum solo by drummer John Bonham.""Heartbreaker"" ends suddenly and goes right into ""Living Loving Maid"" with only a half-second of silence.These things I mentioned make the album a little more interesting, but as a whole, the songs aren't very great."
5,Sends chills down my spine everytime i hear it,This album is amazing and so is the whole band great musicians and jimmy page is one of the most creative innovative complex guitar players ever for example whole lotta love has all kind of creative sounds to that song its a amazing song i dont care how many times its been played on the airwaves its still a great song the thank you song is so beautiful the acoustic guitar is amazing and pretty and robert plants voice is amazing the lemon song is a great blues tune and yes some of the words were copied from blues great robert johnson what a great jam i love heartbreaker and how it fits well with living lovin maid anyways the whole album subperb great musicianship buy it trust me
5,A landmark...of course,"Led Zeppelin II is often cited as the definitive hard rock album, and it is true than within its nine tracks one can discern the origins of all sorts of sacred metal traditions: the sexual frenzy ('Whole Lotta Love'), mystical fantasies ('Ramble On'), breathtaking guitar solos ('Heartbreaker') and just plain heavy riffing all through. This effort actually does feel a bit truncated in comparison to their first album, which sprawled out a bit more. Here they've managed to cut some more succinct, yet just as seminal slices of hard rock. In typical Zeppelin fashion, there is an emphasis on subtlety (such as the jazzy verses on 'What Is and What Should Never Be') as well as on bombast and volume. But probably the main thing that most listeners will remember here is the sheer energy. Highly recommended."
2,Just a bunch of hippies,"Hey, is this freedom rock? WELL TURN IT DOWN!!With a wailing lead singer, a guitar player who tries to cram too many notes in one measure, and a drummer who can't keep time to save his life, this ain't classic rock...it's freedom rock gone bad.For real metal, check out Korn 'n Bizkit.Later!!"
1,Headbanging music produces a headache,"One of the most unoriginal groups in rock history (see review titled ""The Greatest Cover Band of All Time"" for proof, although I would replace the word ""cover"" with ""rip-off"") Zeppelin deflates to a flapjack when compared to its '60s counterpart, The Yardbirds. That band was a wonder. Why settle for this cheese when you can hear the real thing? Plus Robert Plant's singing is excruciatingly shrill. No thanks."
1,The Worst Band in the World,"Without Led Zep we may have been spared the likes of Guns N' Roses, Van Halen, Motley Crue, and the list goes on. Proof that crap breeds crap."
1,Not good!!,"This is strange CD. Man who sing the songs, he look like a man but sound like a woman. And he scream and scream like he feeling in pain. Not too understand what the songs mean either. Buy Madonna CD instead is what I think."
5,Why wouldn't you....,"...love or listen to Led Zeppelin 1-4, if you like Rock music?This album is the Rosetta Stone of rock. I don't know that I can ""review"" Led Zeppelin II. It's like doing a book review of the Bible.I give it 5 stars, what the hay."
5,The Lemon Song,"Zeppelin is such a powerful influence on so many acts. Many will say their favorite album was Led Zeppelin IV. I prefer this masterpiece over Zeppelin IV, I think because of The Lemon Song. Something about that song is so magical. I heard Sublime mix Lemon Song on Get Out and I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever heard."
4,Whole lotta Cliches.,"Dated covers, songs inspired by ""the lord of the rings"" and mock Blues songs where Plant pretends to be an african-american from the masters of hard rock. A classic, but growing very dated as the years ware on."
4,Not their best,"Led Zeppelin IS the #1 hard rock band ever. This album is fantastic, without a low point anywhere on it. But it is not as good as Zeppelin I or IV or Physical Grafitti or Presence or HOH. That is why I only give it four stars. There are no particular songs that I love, and I think whole lotta love is a bit overrated. Of all of the of early Zeppelin track #1's (which have a related style) it is actually my least favorite, but the rest of the songs are great, and whole lotta love is still decent."
3,Bring It On Home,"LED ZEPPELIN II is thE album that convinced at least one generation of teenage boys that they could play the electric guitar. Years later we all realized that we were operating on a different planet than Jimmy Page.These are riffs that thunder along, but they also have some swing. Black Sabbath and Deep Purple never quite figured out that the secret to Led Zeppelin was that they weren't just out to make you bang your head; they could make you swing your hips as well.LED ZEPPELIN II wasn't the artistic peak for the band. That was still several years away. But it was the last time Page would give his fans an all-out heavy metal guitar attack for a while. The band's next two LPs--III and IV, oddly enough--would find Page adding layers and textures to the bands big sound."
2,Sound Quality is Lousy!,"I'll get straight to the point. Who were the idiots that supervised the transfer of this album from the master tape to CD? Didn't anyone hear the distortion rampant thru the songs. Sure the album is 40 years old but there are old recordings of Leslie Gore (early '60's) that sound better than this.The distortion is too bad not to notice. The overall tonal quality of the CD has a very noticeable harsh edge to it. I can remember owning the Last Atlantic Records Superhits package that had that labels hits from 1969-70. The edited version of ""Whole Lotta Love"" (included on that album)that was sent to radio stations sounded better (on vinyl!).Could it be maybe that the software used to take away the master tape hiss was set incorrectly???I would advise anyone to by the earliar CD release of this album.What a waste!"
4,That's the One!,"I had been hearing Train's rendention of ""Ramble On"" on the Howard Stern Show, and I loved it. So I decided to get the original version from Led Zeppelin. I'm not disappointed. As fabulous as Train's, but more authentic with Robert Plant singing it. The CD also has great hits like ""Whole lotta Love"", ""What is and what should never Be"", & ""Living Loving Maid (she's just a woman)"". Worth the price."
1,Great Album -Disappointed by Low Fidelity,"Beware if you get an IMPORT from Industria Argentina you will be very disappointed. I have enoyed The Zepplin for forty years, THIS is not what the LP was like. It is hard to believe this was remastered, it is far worse than the original. I sounds like a bad pirarted copy."
5,Zeppelin is the ultimate rock band,"can't get enough of Zeppelin. the bluesy rock style is uncomparable. The original and inventive talent of Jimmy Page, the raw unmatched vocals of Robert Plant, the hard pulsing beats of John Bonham, and the filling in the cake is John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards has not and can not be duplicated. There will never be another Led Zepplin. They are LEGEND!!"
5,Puts the Heavy in Metal,"I really don't know how you could critize this album/CD. Possibly you could find some fault with it if you were coming from the perspective of comparing it to the first two Hendrix outings or early Doors but looking at this on a comparative basis to 95 per cent of everything else before or after then you realize just how massive the effect of this work has been. Intense, non-stop over the top talent setting an early bar for this type of music that really has never been eclipsed. Regardless of critisism of where Page got his licks and compositions, he sat in the driver's seat and pushed the pedal to the metal on every track on this one. The overall effect is a major mind attack by one of the top 3 heavy rock bands of all time. If you are young and have never experienced Zeppelin, then you need this one or if you have forgotten what the real deal is, you need this refresher course."
5,Bring it on home to me,Led Zeppelin's second album is a classic in every sense of the word. Every single track on here is great. This is what hard rock should be. Highly recommended.
5,From 1969?,"Zeppelin 2 is possibly the most drastic revolutionary album that ever came on the rock scene. Let's face it, most of these songs were too heavy for the top 40. ""Whole Lotta Love"" got played a lot, except they'd leave off the ending (""I wanna be your back door man""). They cut out the middle too, probably as heavy a stuff as you'll ever hear on a rock album. And ""Living Loving Maid"" would have to make my top 40 somewhere as one of the best rock songs ever. And it doesn't stop there. ""Ramble On"" just simply is a great Zeppelin song, ""The leaves have fallen all around, time I was on my way"", this song actually does sound great during the Fall. To someone who had never heard anything by Zeppelin, I would suggest they start with this album. Untitled has some great stuff on it too but this stuff is raw energy that equals or maybe even tops Van Halen's second album."
2,"Great music, lousy sound","What an outstanding album, that brought back great memories. However, as I listened to the CD of the recording I was disappointed by the distortion in the bass and loud passages in general. I wasn't much of an audiophile when the album came out, but I would guess the vinyl sounds lots better."
5,Me and my car run on Led not unleaded!!!!!!,Just the opening riff of Heartbreaker justifies the purchase of II alone. Wont retread other reviews but rather say that this music is far superior to hard rock of today. After turning this one up to 11 on the car stereo Tinnitus never sounded so good!!!!!! A great piece of rock.
5,One of the Best Ever,"This is, hands down, one of the best rock albums ever. If you disagree, then you shouldn't even be here looking at the reviews for this album, thinking about buying it. Go listen to Duran Duran or something, loser."
4,Few scratches but..,expected for the price that i paid which was more than fair. Glad its part of my collection now :) thanks!
5,LZ is the best,"Great purchase. This is one of Led Zeppelin's best cd's. A great cd no matter what rock bands you like, you can listen to this."
5,Best Led Zeppelin album.,II is more consistent than I and far superior to IV. I always found that album overrated. It's still good but I'd take their first 2 any day. Includes their hits Whole Lotta Love and Ramble On. Metal didn't really start until the '70s but Led Zeppelin were ahead of the time. Most people in the late '60s and early '70s were making psychedelic music but not Led Zeppelin. they were more original and that's what made them popular. Now days it's considered classic rock but back than they were one of the harder rock bands. The band and album is influential and one of the best classic albums of all time.
5,great collector's album!,It is extremely difficult to find this album in brand new condition. Led Zeppelin 2 has taken the band to a further and deeper attraction of most rock listeners and lovers back in the 1970s and can still be felt now. It is highly recommended for any contemporary rock lovers that have never experienced the true sound of the classic rock.
5,Best of Led Zeppelin,"Everybody knows ""Stairway to Heaven"". But every song on this opus is a classic. Really worth a listen!"
4,One of the best Zepp albums,"Which does not mean a lot coming from a guy who is NOT a big Zepp fan, and thinks they are way too overrated.However, Zeppelin is Jimmy Page (let's face it, the other guys were all replaceable, no matter how much you love them) and Page is at his peak here. He's more solid than in Zepp I and doesn't fell the need to overdub himself ten times like he did after Zepp III. A good, almost great album, which promised a lot back in '69 -although the band didn't live up to expectations after."
3,"OK, I guess","This is album is mediocre, nothing like the showstopper debut. It has its moments, but it also has some down-points. The crunch-rock classic 'Whole Lotta Love' is great, and so is the LOTR-influenced 'Ramble On'. But some song are just mediocre, like the EXTREMELY boring 'Moby Dick', and the rather corny 'Thank You'. I like Zeppelin's early stuff much better than their late 70's commercial fare, but LZIV and LZI are much better than this one."
1,Booooooooo,"You would like to break my legs and deafen me? Just because I slagged off a record that you like? Oh, that's very nice, very thoughtful of you.What a nice person you are. Actually from what I've seen of other Led Zeppelin fans,I shouldn't have been surprised you said something like that,since you all seem to worship these people like gods."
1,loud stupid heavy metal,"Led Zeppelin is a loud early heavy metal band. I think Elton John, Billy Joel, Amy Grant, Eric Clapton, Chicago and Boston are much more musically talented. Unless you like loud Screaming guitar driven meatal. avoid this album"
1,LED ZEPPELIN FOR BABIES??????,"I CAN'T STAND LED ZEPPELIN. ANYONE WHO LIKES THEM SHOULD HAVE TO BE TRAPPED UNDER ICE. LED ZEPPELIN WERE JUST A LOUSY BABY BAND WHO MADE SOME OF THE LOUSIEST SONGS EVER WRITTEN AND ARE ALWAYS PLAYED ON THE RADIOS. CAN IT STOP??? ROBERT PLANT HAS SOME OF THE LOUSIEST VOICES I HAVE EVER HEARD WHO JUST CAN'T SING AT ALL HE JUST SCREAMS AND SOUNDS MORE LIKE A BABY. I MEAN WHY CAN'T HE SING LIKE LOU GRAMM AND MARK KNOPFLER????????? THIS IS HUGE NOISE AND I HATE THIS!! DONT LISTEN TO ANYONE WHO GIVE A LOUSY BAND LIKE LED ZEPPELIN 5 STARS. BUY ANY DIRE STRAITS AND FOREIGNER ALBUM INSTED BELIEVE ME,LOU GRAMM AND MARK KNOPFLER CAN SING TOO."
5,a must have for all classic rock fans!,"This CD truly shows Led Zeppelin at their best. Their is not a song I do not like on this. Jimmy Page,with his crazy/awesome guitar pyrotechnics, and Plant, with his screeching pop a lemon voice, go together like peas and carrots(Forest Gump). The ""Lemon Song"" and ""Ramble On"" are my favorite songs on here."
1,Disappointed,"Overall, just disappointed in the book. Once I looked through it, I found only 5 recipes I would try. Not worth it."
2,Disappointed,"I liked the look of the watch. However, I was disappointed with it because it would not keep accurate time, even after having the battery replaced. I guess I received a ""dud"" for a watch."
3,Do not recommend as a toy for a child,I purchased this toy as a display piece. I think it would have been impossible to get the figures out of the package without wire cutting pliers. The deer get tangled in the reigns once out of the package. Once the plastic display arm is set you will not want to touch it - once you touch it or move the base the arm usually collapses and the deer pop off. My niece received one as a gift and after much frustration the deer are used as individual toys.
3,Classic Look But Not User-Friendly,"I am a HUGE fan of the classic TV special, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and collect anything I can get my hands on, associated with the classic special. This set was 'gifted' to me and I love the look...wonderful detail and Santa, the sleigh and the reindeer look perfect. However, as the previous poster stated, the arm holding the reindeer is VERY touchy. If you touch or bump the arm, everything collapses and me being the impatient person I am...can't get the deet untwisted and re-attached, so my better half has to fix things for me. We have put it on a shelf, high enough so I can't touch or bump it. For the look and feel of the classic special, this can't be beat...it's just very weak in the armature aspect."
2,Not what expected at all,"I bought this book as a gift for a friend based on the great categories it has to offer for recording book information. I was so disappointed to find that the spaces allowed for writing are so small. Also, the book is hard to navigate. The hard cover and hard binding don't allow for anyone to write it in it (inflexible). I gave it as a gift still, but I had to apologize for what a cruddy book it was."
5,Received as a gift -- I use it regularly,"This bowl is just perfect, no matter who you are shopping for. Who couldn't use a gorgeous, clean-lined, shiny dish? We've had ours for 16 years -- still looks great.**** Whoops, too hasty. I thought this was the tri-corner bowl. I have both, love both, but I got this more like 10 years ago."
4,A stunning flawed film,"So close. There are stunning visual glimpses of the upper west side, France at war, a mythic-reality tango accordionist, ... . These cinematic gems are worth the price of admission. Yet at moments the writing jars. Pity. Making movies is difficult."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This was a scholarly look at the history of Texas. I had just read Mitchner's Texas and wanted to read something to balance it out, but I just couldn't get very far in this one. It was highly recommended to me, but I did not enjoy it."
5,The Visionary Details,"Imagine making the micro-stages of a plum blossom's growth the basis of a startling series of nature poems. But this is what Po-Jen Sung manages to do, and Red Pine's translation seems elegent and luminous and baffling in all the right places. The poet is never at a loss for the perfect image. He is intuitive and always flowing with the spirit of the inner details. This is visionary poetry at its best -- and the woodcuts of each of the flower's stages are incomparable. A must read. Thanks to Red Pine for this deeply moving work."
5,Beautiful book worthy of any collection,"Very Aubrey Beardsleyesque draftsmanship. You buy this book for the illustrations. It is fun to read the Chinese text and compare it to the translations, too, but it is the pictures that grab you. Buy it for all your sakura and hanami-loving friends."
5,A great choice,I just returned from my first trip with the K28NC headphones. The sound is incredible. The headphones are infinitely adjustable. They are easy to stow and very well designed. They are also well built. I believe that about 70% of the jet noise was blocked with the noise cancellation. They are very comfortable and I use them at home on my computer without the noise cancellation enabled. The battery is supposed to last about 20 hours. I've already gotten about 30 hours use on the original battery. I would (and have) highly recommend these headphones.
2,Great sound but a bit uncomfortable,These headphones sound great and fold down small enough that they don't take up too much space in your bag. They do have two problems though. The first is the cords. Both the cord to the headphones and the cord to the jack come out of the battery pack at exactly the same point. This makes for a tangled mess. The second problem is the headband. It's tight and uncomfortable.
2,A little empty music.,"Despite the critical acclaim and Booker Prize nomination, this book is an uninspired attempt to contrast the social ills of two very different societies. The theme is perhaps noble and difficult, but Desai fails to pull it off. Neither of the main characters, the siblings Uma and Arun, are protrayed in more than one dimension and are hardly worth caring for. One learns less about them than how they are perceived by others. The events that pepper Uma's life in India are nothing more than disjointed vignettes, and Arun's little window into a dysfunctional suburban American family left an empty feeling. Desai deserves credit for her skills in human and social observation but the entire novel is only that and never once engages the reader's heart and mind in the story-telling. Finally, the writing style in the two parts of the novel is so contrasting that I wondered if they were written by two different authors."
2,Poor book,"This book, I feel is not interesting and I had stoped half way, the grammar of the book doesn't make any sense. The book doesn't chronologically follow. I would not give more 2 stars to this book."
3,"Lovely, heart-rending read about loneliness and family","This is my first Anita Desai book and I enjoyed reading it. A story about the lives Uma and her brother, Arun, living in different continents, the book explores two different cultures and the different ways they treat untraditional, unconventional people. Throughout the book, the thread of the story is thinly related to meals and the food the characters encounter in their days.Although I enjoyed reading the book, there's a certain restlessness and pointlessness, if you will, throughout the story. It's interesting to learn about the two cultures and I very much relate to the characters' loneliness and feeling of being a stranger even at home. However, I can't help but question the progression of the story. A lot of things are not resolved and the ending is rather unsatisfying. Nevertheless, this is a pretty well-written book and I will definitely read Anita Desai's other books."
2,terrible,"this is the story of a young indian boy trapped in a dysfunctional indian family who travels to america to study and ends up an exchange student in the house of a dysfunctional american family. the story raises questions of nationality versus human nature, the loneliness of the human soul, and the search for affection in a world devoid of love.while the story itself may have worked, it's written in a boring, almost expository manner. desai doesn't spend time developing her characters and they come across as flat. they seem puppets in a play rather than people. the novel is extremely plot driven and jam packed with too many issues and too little exploration.i would rather have a simple story and a world of breathing, true to life characters than a story filled with issues and characters that don't emote. this book gave me a good look at how not to write prose."
2,Definitely more Fasting than Feasting!,"Very disappointing work from one of my favourite authors. Minimal character development, hardly any plot to speak of, stereotypical in the extreme, 'Fasting, Feasting' is a very pale reflection of the earlier (and stupendous) 'Clear Light of Day'. The attempt to juxtapose an eastern family dynamic versus a western one, without fully exploring either, came off as forced and disjointed ..and left each narrative feeling incomplete and unfulfilling to the reader."
1,I Can't Believe How Bad This Was!,"As much as the writing style is nice and it is easy reading, this book is so depressing with no likable character, that it became painful to finish. The depiction of the ""Typical American Family"" is so contrived it's rediculous. At some points I almost started laughing.Overall I would absolutely not recommend this book."
1,Who Are these People,"This book is written from two perspectives: Uma's and Arun's. I felt after I read the book I had no better understanding of either Uma or Arun and their struggles. I wasn't quite sure why Arun was so standoffish and simply afraid of people. Poor Uma, but I did not feel that sorry for her.This book was boring and lacked insight. Don't waste your time."
4,A Rose by Any Other Name...,"What is in a name? This question has profound implications during an anti-Semitic regime. The surname is a precursor to identity: Klein implies French Catholicism or Dutch Jewish ancestry. Seeking to correct a simple case of mistaken identity becomes a Kafkaesque journey. Exploration of the doppelganger is rarely more personal. A well-scripted, riveting intellectual thriller."
5,Best fiction film representation of the Holocaust...,"...because it avoids facing the issue head-on, thus falling into cliche; I have not seen the DVD yet, so I can't vouch for quality, but Losey's film is Hitchcock meets Kafka meets film noir -- a riveting study of what happens when a Gentile who fleeces Jews in occupied Paris c.1943 is mistaken for a shadowy Jewish Resistance fugitive who happens to share his name; step-by-step, the ""wrong"" Mr. Klein gains every attribute of the Jew, shedding his safe and comfortable bourgeois identity, as he searches for the ""real"" Mr. Klein; the climax is shattering. By treating his material as an allegorical thriller, Losey paradoxically avoids sensationalizing the subject, ala ""Schindler's List."" Plus, it's Alain Delon's best performance."
3,It's OK,"The instruction is ok, the looks are ok although kind of over the top not really for everyday looks....some of the models start offa mess and end up looking like hoochies. The videos appearance will make you wonder why you paid $40 for what looks like it was filmed in a bathroom with a handheld camera.....PASS!"
2,Another opinion on Bringing Out Baby,"This book is great for those not familiar with the area and have kids under 3. However, I didn't find the book to be as comprehensive as I thought it would be. I can name two wonderful toddler parks in Kirkland that were not even mentioned in the book. Informing the reader as to which parks have restrooms is VERY beneficial. However, if you have ""Out and About Seattle with Kids,"" skip buying this book."
5,Amazing instrument!,"This was a Christmas present, and my favourite one this year! I'm an amateur violinist, having taken lessons from the age of six till I was an adult and now I play on and off. It took a few minutes to set up the bridge and tune the strings, but once properly tuned they don't slip, and the bridge works fine for me. The violin is comfortable to play, doesn't bother my family and friends, and it's such fun playing around with the tone and volume - it sounds like a rock band at high volume, if you can stand it in the headphones... It even comes complete with a reasonable bow, rosin, a little cushion (that I haven't tried), headphones, a cord to connect to an amp, and a surprisingly nice carry case - think electric guitar style.Extremely impressive and a lot of fun - I'm amazed they can do it at this price!"
4,Additional Purchases Necessary.,"I followed other users suggestions, buying a medium bridge, fine tuners for all strings, however, let me add that my E string snapped while just trying to tune it, and my pegs are a bit slippery.. I'd suggest, not only getting a glaesel medium bridge, 4x stable style fine tuners, but also, a full pack of helicore strings, and maybe some peg dope of some kind. Also, the rosin it comes with is a big ... hard. I scraped it across a mildy course surface [the cardboard shipping box] and applied it to the bow without any problems. The electrical system on this violin works quite well, the pickup does what a pickup should."
3,UPGRADE IT,"I bought this earlier in the year, and just bought a Cecilio 1/2 size electric for my son.The Cecilio is a much better build, as it is made of wood, the bridge is superior, and the case is WAY better.That being said, I like this violin. After upgrading the strings and the bridge, it has a good sound.The rosin was cracked, but not that big of a deal, as you should replace that anyways.I would maybe buy this again, but most likely I would go with the Cecilio."
1,Beware,"Mine arrived with an uncut bridge and faulty pegs (plastic), that would not stay and couldn't be restrung (do to the holes being cut too close to the end of the peg). I thought this would be a quick fix for a live performance, but ended up having to rent a NS model."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Don't waste your time on this one; spend a bit more and get a proper electric violin, you will be much more happy if you do."
4,4/4 electric violin with case and accessories,"i am very happy with this product although my only concern was the flimsy E-string. i've been playing violin for 9 years now and i know how to correctly tune a violin. once i got all four strings in tune, i played a few scales and pop goes the e-string. aside from that, everything works fine, the bow is 'meh' quality, ended up using my own bow because it was actually straight. overall, the product looks and sounds great. would definitely recommend to others"
2,Bad,This violin is very low quality and the bridge does not work well. I do not reccomend this. It is a bad violin.
3,Confused,It looks cool and is cheap... I haven't been able to get it to work yet. It's a good thing I have a degree in musical instrument repair.
1,Don't Do It.,"It's not a bad sounding instrument, especially with as cheap as it is, but you can't vibrato on it. In order to vibrato you have to be able to hold the violin up using nothing but your chin and shoulder, but with the shape of this it's impossible. It does come with a shoulder rest, but it's very small and will not support the weight of the violin."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"OKAY THIS THING IS EXTRMELY BEAUTIFUL, IVE BEEN PLAYING VIOLIN FOR 7 YEARS NOW, AND SHOULD HAVE KNOWN TO STICK WITHMY ACOUSTIC, I GUESS I GET WHAT I PAID FOR. MY FIRST TIME GETTING IT THE ELECTRONICS DID NOT WORK AT ALL, AND I HAD A PAGEANT SO THAT WAS VERY UPSETTING. THE STRINGS WERE POPPING LEFT TO RIGHT AND THE BRIDGE IS WAY TO BIG, MY ADVICE IF YOU WANT TO GET AN ELECTRIC SOUND TO YOUR VIOLIN, BUY A PICKUP."
2,Violin wasn't as I expected,"The electric violin's fingerboard was messed up and parts of it was chipped off.Not only that, the chin rest was missing."
4,Let me clear something up...,"I'd just like to put in that just because it has only one fine tuner doesn't make it a cheap violin... I've been playing violin for 4 years, and my sister's played for about 17... PROFESSIONAL VIOLINS HAVE ONLY ONE FINE TUNER! Anyway, I'm not surprised the headphone jack didn't work... Think about this... A normal acoustic violin costs at LEAST [...] and a GOOD electric violin costs around [...]. This is an AMAZING deal for an electric violin so the accessories will most likely be as cheap as possible. If you're thinking of getting an electric violin you'll truly play ALL THE TIME, I'd reccommend the YAMAHA electric it costs [...] but it is VERY high quality! If you don't have enough money I'd DEFINATELY recommend this violin it's VERY good price."
1,"Good enough, while it worked","The quality of this violin is pretty cheap. When it comes, it doesn't even have fine tuning screws. That was my first clue that maybe I should have bought a more expensive violin. My second clue came a week ago when the headphone jack stopped working halfway through playing. The violin worked for three and 1/4 sessions.But, while it was working the sound coming from the headphones wasn't atrocios. The bow was ok, too. So if you get lucky and the violin doesn't break while you're playing it, its not bad."
4,Love it,Hey guys and girlsI have tried different violins in different stores and i have to sayTHIS one just perfect .. 2 minor things to take into consideration1. get new strings immdiately2. get better fitted bridge.. the one that comes with violin does not have little placements for violinI got new strings. It made a huge difference. Eventually i will get strings with more depth but for now it is perfectI plugged into Ampeg mini stack bass amp and Boss ME-25 and was left speechless!This is awesome!
3,"Umm, not sure....","Well, we read the reviews, and decided to take the chance and get this violin for our daughter. It came right on time, the installation of the bridge was OK, the pegs slip a bit, but we have the peg drops....our only complaint is the bow itself. Even when fully prepped, there is only scratching coming when played on the strings. So, either we are all off and the bow does work, or we have to revisit the bow to get it to play. Right now, it's only good for plucking...."
3,Great instrument but needs additions.,The violin itself is great however the condition it came in wasnt great. The neck was all scuffed up and I could see glue around the edges of it that I had to scrape off. The bottom of the violin next to the battery pack was sagging open so I had to try to force it back into frame.The Rosin/strings/bridge = crapReplace the above and hope yours is in better condition and you have a great violin.
4,A good practice violin,I read the previous reviews and made all the suggested modification. The violin works well as a practice violin since it is quieter than my non-electric violin. The sound isn't as good. I am considering buying some effect pedals to change the sound a little and have a little more fun. I think it is definitely worth the little money it costs.
4,Ok to start with,"I do not know violins very well, but I do play bagpipes at the more advanced level of skill so I know that when you go to buy an instrument, you can't buy one from just anywhere and expect it to last your entire musical career. I want to learn to play so I bought this violin knowing that I would get what I paid for it. The headphone jack seems to have broken (by the second day) so now I can only get sound out of one side of my headphones (if any sound at all because sometimes there's not). I understand that this probably isn't the best quality violin out there, but it was cheap and I know that as I get better, I'll have to upgrade my instrument. So to make a long story short (providing that you'll still be able to hear yourself play) this is a good buy for beginners, but don't get too attached to it."
3,What could have been America,"The story is a dreamy voyage into a land that could have been America, that would have liked to be America, but (as one realizes from reading this work) turned out to be totally different. It isn't a ""a brilliant piece of imagination"" as an earlier post said, and it isn't earth-shattering. But it is memorable and unique among novels, in that it is a journey into a world that would be our own world, isn't our own world, and yet has something mysteriously in common with it.It is also unique among Kafka's work in that it isn't as dreary as the rest. In the course of the disappointments Karl encounters, there is always an air of optimism and cheer, as a breath of fresh air - the story contains adventure and hope within its melanchoy realities. To those looking for an escape from the dreariness that prevails around them - something Kafka definitely needed and must have found in writing Amerika - this story will be a wonderful gift."
1,im speechless,what a stupid album. COME ON BLACKMETAL BANDS MOST OF THEM ARE A BUNCH OF NERDS WHO SET AROUND A PLAY D&D SOME ARE ALSO RACIST. JUST READ LORDS OF CHAOS.
4,Very soothing,"Rolling thunder (at a distance) natural sounding rain (almost anyway). Very soothing, and relaxing."
1,DISTURBING,"I popped this CD in last night before I went to bed -- a few minutes through it, I swear I heard voices/music in the background of the CD.I re-listened to the CD today and I was right -- there's overdubbed garble recorded in the background of the storms ---- definitely NOT the sort of things you want floating around the room when you're trying to fall asleep -- sort of like a ghost in the machine ---- caveat emptor -- you get what you pay for."
1,No Manual,I purchased this product but it did not come with a manual. I still don't know how to operate it.
5,It works!,"It works, what else can I say? It backs up absolutely everything. About the speed, however, it is somewhat slow because the module must compress the data. If you use a module scan utility, you'll find that the module only has 101KB of RAM. So, the backup software compresses it to fit on the module. Handspring could have given the module 8MB of RAM to backup the system faster, but it'd be more expensive. Personally, I'll wait 30 seconds for a backup than only wait 5 seconds and pay twice as much."
4,Customer Service leaves a lot to be desired,"Handspring makes a generally good, simple to use product. The backup module falls into this catagory. Unfortunately, Handspring has some poor customer service."
5,Cheap affordable protection.,"This springboard module is great. I would highly recommend to users of the Handspring visor line, as it would give some protection to data loss while away from your computer.Picture this, you are away travelling on a business trip, and your Visor just so happened to have a total drain in battery power and you did not know it until you needed to use it.Go into you bag or briefcase, and restore the information back into your Visor, a very quick process!"
5,Fantastic - Everyone Visor owner should have one,"This is probably the best Sprinboard module there is. It simply works. It is simple to use, and it is very useful. I have restored many times from this module after some fatal errors, and it is just fantastic to plug this module in, hit a button and then bang, back to where you were before the crash. Highly recommended to every Visor owner!"
2,What a disappointment.,"I had to contact Plano to get these details:""The model 964 is only offered as follows: 2 boxes have 6 fixed compartments and 2 have 12 fixed compartments. These racks will accept any of the other 3600 series boxes."" So the 964 Organizer Rack is only offered with the bottom-of-the-line boxes with the standard latches and fixed compartments. Their excellent ProLatch boxes with the adjustable compartments must be purchased separately. I wish that they would instead offer the deluxe version (or just the rack separately), and stop trying to save me a few pennies."
3,ok,this unit storage was a bit under constructed and could not stay on wall with any amount of heavey weight and the fix dividers instead of adjustable are no good and cpeaply made.
5,its great,its rough tough and will not break i use them for nuts and bolts and auto parts and they work just fine
2,The product arrived damaged...twice!,"As in other reviews, the frame was bent due to the plastic strap being too tight. I thought once might be a fluke so I sent for a replacement. The second was just as bad. I even tried to let it stand for a few days to see if it would regain the shape but to no avail. The drawers worked fine but the frame is obviously not high quality material. The buyer should be aware of this possibility when ordering. Maybe they'll have better luck than I did but I would not recommend this product."
3,A Good organizer Rack,"I have been purchasing Plano for many years. I was unhappy about how weak the frame was that holds the stowaway inserts. There isn't enough thickness in the frame. When I put a small box on top of the rack, it sagged on top.The frame does interlock so one can stack on top of each other. I put four racks on top of each and didn't feel that happy about it's stability . SO I stacked three on instead. My older products can be stacked very tall without a worry.I want very much to buy USA made product and bought it for that reason. I do hope they will take my comments with the thought of USA makes it better & not cheaper and that is why I want to by USA made."
1,Cheap and Worthless. Do Not Buy.,"Cheaply Made. I tried this one even though the bins are not adjustable because it was cheaper than the next model up. There is a packing strap that is used to keep the bins in the case but it is secured so tightly that it warps the case making the whole thing useless. After a couple of weeks before I just returned it, the case still has not regained its shape. The bins are just as cheap. This is nowhere worth the price. I am not going to buy the next model up and I am just going to stay away from Plano products. Plano was about quality at one time and that time is gone."
5,Listening to Christmas songs in June!,"I bought this CD earlier in the year but haven't listened to it until now. I totally love this CD! It is one of their best a cappella works! If you are a Blenders fan, this is a definite must-have..."
4,an english review,this film was good. i saw this film at school for a project we are doin in english. we had to write infomation about the film it is good and funny it. the thing is it leaves you with a cliff hanger.
2,In The Shelter Of His Arms,"I purchased this CD under the assumption that it was recorded with Dwane,Joe, Steve and Richard singng as shown in a picture on the cover but the singers are from an earlier time."
2,Some quality songs,"This CD set has a few amazing songs, such as Saltwater, Tilt's Invisible, and Happiness Happening. However, 3 or 4 tracks out of 22 is simply not enough for the cost of a box set. DJ Lex's mixes these songs for the ""bonus"" CD but a slew of bad songs put together does not make a better song. If you are a fan of good trance but don't have much money to spend, I'd avoid this one."
3,Pretty good but not for me.,"I bought this looking for a really good speaker phone,which it is. I wear hearing aids on both ears so this is a nice feature.Unfortunately the handsets themselves are horrible for hearing aids. I probably should have checked for compatability but I really find it hard to believe that it isn't manditory on all phones by now. I also find the phone relatively complicated to put numbers into."
4,"Not a classic, but just what Daddy ordered",Story - 3 starsArt - 4 starsMessage - 5 starsAnd the message is what makes this such a wonderful children's book. The story itself isn't exceptional -- it is about a Daddy/Daughter day spent together (with the family dog) doing nothing special. But the watercolor art is cute and well rendered by Ms. Julia Douglas and the message that spending time together is the most special thing of all tugs at the heart strings. I read this to my four year old and she was hugging and cuddling up to me before I was halfway through it. That alone is worth the price of the book! I think I'll find myself reaching for this one whenever I want to connect with my girl in that special way on daddies and daughters can.
5,lovely book,My Little Girl is an adorable book about a daddy-daughter day. It is a wonderful example of how important it is to spend time with our children! The illustrations are beautiful. I loved the easy going writing style. I have read this book dozens of times to my three children since I got it two weeks ago. My 2 year old daughter likes to point out the daddy on the page and then points to HER daddy and smiles. It is very cute. Even my sons have listened to the story several times. I found this to be a delightful children's story that would make a wonderful addition to any home library. It would also make a lovely Christmas gift from Daddy to his little girl!
4,A Sweet Story to Share,"My little girls loved this story! My older daughter, 5 years old, immediately wanted to dress up like Katie--the little girl in the story. It is a sweet, sweet story for a daddy to share with his little girls and to talk about the things they do together. The illustrations are delightful. They match the story well.The only reason I gave this story 4 and not 5 stars is that the story is written a little differently. I am mentioning this just so that it doesn't take you by surprise. It is written a lot like a country music song--the story gives you all of the major details but you have to infer the connecting details in the story. When I read this book to my daughters, it was as if I was flipping through a photo album and telling the story of each page. They don't necessarily connect to each other, but you love the story that each page holds. And my little girls loved the story that each page in this book had to tell!"
4,A sweet book with a nice message,"This is a sweet book about a dad and his little girl spending the day together.Dad promises his daughter that they will spend a spectacular day together...and they do. They spend TIME together going to a co-op, laying back in the grass looking at clouds, eating lunch together, swinging on a tire swing and then getting ready for bed.With the economy the way it is, this book has a good lesson. A spectacular day doesn't mean you NEED to go to a theme park, or Chuck E. Cheese's or some other popular (and usually expensive) destination. Just taking the time to be together and pay attention to those you care about is what is really important.The illustrations are beautiful.I would have rated this 5 stars, but I don't feel the words flow as well as other picture books that are perennial favorites."
2,Bedtime story that falls short,"This is a cute little story about a man and his little daughter.The illustrations have been done very well and are captivating for your little one. However, there are limitations on how fluid the story transitions. There is no commonality for many children and this book will have a limited audience. It is too much for a child under 5 to understand and this is too simplified for a child older than 8. The story does not flow very smoothly and is more of a biographical depiction rather than a bedtime story for the masses.The intentions of spending time with your child and treating her like a princess for a day is a great concept but the story seems to fall short.Unfortunately, this book won't become a classic, even with its ""Celebrity Appeal"".It's worth a read at the library."
2,Not what i expected,"I purchased this book because it was written by a country singer and I was actively looking for material that illustrated songs I have in my classroom repertoire. As an elementary music teacher this song proved to be somewhat maudlin and not at all in sinc with Tim McGraws song ""My Little Girl"". It is a great book for Dads to express their love of their daughters but it was un-useable in my classroom. I had hoped for something like Mary Chapin Carpenters ""Hailey Came to Jackson"". The book that accompanied THAT song is PERFECT for a music class."
3,A sweet book for dads and daughters,"My Little Girl is a very sweetly written story best shared by dads and daughters. The book could have used a bit more transition between activities, but for children under 10, it doesn't matter too much. This may not be a good choice for families who have experienced divorce or remarriage and have family members for whom not having a nuclear family is a sensitive subject.My 10 year old daughter absolutely loved the book and did not want to let it out of her sight. She read it to her stepdad, and although it caused us both to choke up a bit, she couldn't have been happier.The artwork was sweet and whimsical, as all little girls books should be. Overall, it was a good choice."
3,A sweet book,"This is a sweet book, but I am not very impressed. I can't say that my daughter and I felt very inspired to do anything different than we already do. The one thing it will do is make a little girl who doesn't get to spend time with her Daddy feel awful. It's really dad who needs the lesson, not the kid. It was just ""okay"" to us."
3,Its nice but.....,The Amazon site states that this unit comes with the cable and pc-link software. It does NOT. I have sent 3 emails to the help desk with NO replies. No phone number to call anyone. I believe I will not order from them again.The unit seems ok for the price tho.
3,"Good features, but dissapointing PC sync","This is billed as being able to sync with your PC. This is true, but it ONLY synchronizes with the software that comes with it. So, it won't sync with Outlook or anything else, but what is worse in my mind is that there is NO import/export functions whatsoever (except to the unit itself). That mease the ONLY way to get addresses and so forth into the PC program is to manually type it all, tediously, through an inefficiently designed interface. It's very strange because the program and the attractive handheld unit are quite capable otherwise."
4,IS GOOD FOR ALL.,"This organiser are very useful, for students, teachers, salespeople, etc. THE IMAGE ON THIS PAGE IS THE 1MB Model (check it, is wonderful), AND THE IMAGE THERE IS THIS ORGANISER."
4,IS GOOD FOR ALL.,"This organiser are very useful, for students, teachers, salespeople, etc. (check it, is wonderful)"
2,The last experience,"I think this will be my last book of Sidney Sheldon, may be the book is good, but all of his books have the same style: the first part of the story you can't put the book down, in the middle he writes pages and pages of stories that doesn't have to do anything with the main story, and at the end he repeats two or three times everything to get to the end, when you are about 3/4 of the book you just don't know if you want to finish or just skip all the pages to the end of the book.The story of the book is a well known story of Hollywood, if you are a woman and you want to have success there you have to have sex with the directors, if you are a man you have to deceive the director to have their attention."
3,Not overly impressed,"This was my first exposure to a Sidney Sheldon book. While I bought it for 'light reading' for a flight I was taking, I had also read some reviews calling Sheldon a ""master"", etc. etc. I suppose I expected more than this plain, going-nowhere story."
1,A victim of the seedy side of Hollywood,"I read this book a long time ago and I think the casting couch image was grossly overplayed. The movie was the same way. I felt sorry for Jill Temple because she had it rough right from the start. A mother who was poor and fanatical about her religion.Jill runs off to Hollywood hoping to make it big. Well she does make a movie, but it wasn't the kind shown at a big premiere. She also ""performs"" for others too but those don't necessarily end up on film.Tired of being abused, she meets and marries an up and coming comedian named Toby. Hitched to his rising star, she uses her newfound power to pay backthose that caused her harm in Hollywood, unaware that her past will come back to haunt her.If one can get past the grossly overplayed casting couch image, they might enjoy this book. I will say that the movie was better though."
3,Keeps you interested,"I don't read everything Sidney Sheldon writes, but I've read several of his books. He knows how to write fast-paced and interesting stories. No, they aren't classics, but must everything be? This is not the best of his books which I have read, but it kept me entertained. I wish the ending had been happier. One quibble: The scene in the pool where Josephine/Jill is embarrassed--OH PLEASE! It does not happen like that! If it did, taking a bath would be quite a messy experience! I mean, Josephine should have been rushed to a hospital! But Sheldon is a man, so he hasn't a clue about that. That scene--which is somewhat significant to the general story--does not ring true. In any case, it's an entertaining book and an easy read."
3,Much Too Wordy,"This was an interesting story, but I think it could have been told in about ten or fifteen thousand less words."
2,Dark characters and a dark ending,"I have read all Sidney Sheldon novels when I was a teenager and am reading again after 20 years. This is the darkest story I have ever read by him. Both the main characters had no redeeming qualities and meet with an apt ending. They are ambitious, care nothing for others or for one another, achieve great stardom but have no love and no happiness. When i finished, I felt what a waste of life and what a waste of my time."
2,Good story but no happy ending,This story is just depressing. It leaves you feeling empty inside after reading. You definelty are happier with your own life after reading but I wouldn't waste your time.
2,cardboard cut out characters,"This book is what I would call all that is bad about (cheap) contemporarypopular fiction. The characterizations are two dimensionaland the sex and violence is shoved in for good measure.I was sick of it half way through.My advise to Sidney Sheldon is get a plot and take a course in abnormal psychology, so that he can understand sociopathic personalities."
2,Agree Agree,"I couldn't agree more with the previous review. We love the the chair, but are $45 for a replacement pad. Are you kidding me. It took us forever to find a replacement, and the pad is not durable at all. Ours is ripping at the seams. Update- Called Doral- the manufacturer, they sell replacement pads for $10 plus shipping. They now have vinyl pad as well. Problem solved."
2,Hmm...,"Well, I personally don't like this kind of music. But i can understand why some people would, and that's why i gave it a 2 instead of a 1."
3,No NTFS Partitions!,"This USB to IDE cable works, but be aware that it only supports FAT32 partitions. This means that the filesize is limited to 4GB. I bought this to backup and transport ISO files of DVD's which are approx. 4.5GB each. That clearly does not work. I'm still looking for one that does support NTFS partitions..."
5,chef d&#65533;&#65533;uvre of one of the finest sanskritists,"I'm studying sanskrit using this marvellous reader and think it's the best sanskrit reader available. After having worked through Perry's Sanskrit Primer, one should be able to take up Lanman's Reader the way its author designed it in the preface, i.e. starting with the easy Nala Story of the Mahabharata. Then follow the more difficult Hitopadesha and the Kathasaritsagara. The last two parts (Manava Dharmashastra and the Veda) are the most difficult ones. However notes, vocabulary carefully graded progression of the texts make it a highly enjoyable device for learning more about the language but also about the fascinating realm of ancient indian literature and culture. I highly recommend this book!"
4,It is okay - especially for the $$,Have used it with several different type/brand cards succesfully. Have also used on three different computers successfully. This looks like it is very closely related to the LaCie 108092 8-in-1 Media Reader.
2,NOT microwave safe,"Even though these SAY they are microwave safe, they are NOT!! Out of 12 plates, 4 of them have now cracked in the microwave; and I have only had them 3 months!! They also chip easily."
4,Overall good product with minor annoyances,"Got these in and I have to say they are sturdy and nice looking. Ran them through the dish washer because, of course, with shipping comes dirt and cardboard residue. Additionally, I was perturbed to have to deal with stickers that were on each and every plate. (Did this before washing)Typically this wouldn't be an issue but since they are clear glass plates, the stickers adhesive tends to show pretty bad. Besides that they are very nice. No problems with shipping and received them quickly."
5,A great purchase,Keep this in stock. Even the outlet stores in WI do not carry clear glass anymore. Too simple and pedestrian for the hip Chicago and Madison crowds. We simple Waukesha Co. folk appreciate it.
5,Great quality,I am so glad I bought these plates. They come in handy and are fun to use for Christmas or special occasions when putting chargers under them or anything colorful to show through.. They go with everything! They arrived quickly and look fantastic.
3,Plates,"I ordered these plates because they had a clean modern feeling and were both dishwasher and microwave safe. I emailed the manufacture to check and they stated they were microwave safe. However, I was disappointed when they arrived because one of them had a very large white inclusion in the middle of the glass. There was also a few others that minor imperfections in the glass. Because the product was relatively cheap for 12 plates, I decided to just throw away the one with the big white inclusion and keep the rest of the plates. But the quality is not what I expected."
2,Wish I hadn't bought these plates.....,"These plates were what I thought I wanted. Simple, cheap, no design, no frills. I was thrilled when Amazon gave me free shipping, however that's where my satisfaction ended. These plates are fine for placing food on them, and for the dishwasher, however, two of them have already cracked and broken while re-heating food in the microwave. The first time surprised me and I thought that there must have been a flaw in that plate. When it happened the second time the same way, I realized that these plates are NOT well made and should not be placed in the microwave. I recall that both times occurred when the food wasn't hot the first time, and I hit the microwave for another minute. Both plates' outer edge cracked ALL the way around and separated from the base. What a shame that glass would break in the microwave. As a result, I do NOT recommend these plates, and now have 10 instead of 12, whose usage is very limited to me."
3,Glass,These plates are well made and are reasonably priced. But they are a beoootch to keep clean. You cannot simply toss them in dish washer and expect them to come out looking pristine. Any splotch looks a 1000x worse on these glass plates. This is the only drawback.
4,Bre's,"Firstly, I must say that this should rather be classed as a mystery than Christian Fiction. Having said that, I must say it is one of the best mysteries I've ever read. The action simply does not stop. The characters are vivid and well realised. The author has shown a great deal of understanding in regard to the Amish community. A thrilling mystery. Read it."
3,"Good, but had problems","I agree that over all the book was enjoyable, but I was dissapointed in the attitude the author displayed of the military and his lack of knowledge of how an Air Force base works and how investigations would be handled. A general would never been at a crime scene without his investigators (a group called OSI) along with Security Forces (military police) members. He also showed a lack of understanding of Air Force promotion ways - one person does NOT stay at one base for thirty years and make general - would NEVER happen. With all of this aside, the book had a wonderful characters. But since the author got so much of the military ways wrong, it makes me wonder what else he got wrong."
4,Makes sitting much more comfortable,"My butt was hurting constantly at work because of the poor padding in my chair so I finally broke down and picked one of these up. When you sit on it, it's not extremely comfortable like a plush chair or anything but it's enough to make sitting for long periods of time easily doable.The only downside to the product is its look. I mean...c'mon...does it have to look like butt cheeks just because it's a butt cushion?! I bought the black one (stupid me) for a grey chair and I embarassed when people see it."
5,Fan of Michael Hawley,"I read the first book by Michael Hawley after it was given to me by a friend. I enjoyed it so much I passed it on to a friend, who passed it on to another friend and so on. It has made the rounds of our neighborhood. I purchased the second book from Amazon and enjoyed it as much as the first. It is now making the rounds of my friends. We all wish Mr. Hawley would write more mysteries. He is a terrific writer and we loved his books. Write some more."
1,I couldn't even stand to watch it all...,"I can't say I thought this would be good. Especially with the lousy actor Ben Affleck playing the lead. It has a terrible plot and really lame script. The acting.....well Ben affleck is terrible but all the other actors ""seem"" pretty good up next to him. As far as special effects go, They're either good or really cheesy. The only real reason I saw this in the first place was because it's one of the movies that ""Scary Movie 4"" is supposed to parody....I can't wait for that. So if you want a good superhero movie, I'd suggest Spiderman or the X-men movies."
1,What?!,"Duncan Wong is obviously a very skillful yoga practitioner, and this DVD shows it -- but that's pretty much all you get: a pretty show of Wong's abilities. If you're a beginner, forget it. There's no instruction for any of the moves, he just jumps right in and goes -- and he goes fast. You have no idea if you're doing anything right: are my feet right? Am I breathing right? Is my torso right? Nothing. I thought I would just follow along, but I had zero confidence I was doing anything correctly, so whats the point? I don't know what Wong had in mind when creating this DVD, but its certainly NOT an instructional DVD. Don't waste your time."
3,Very advanced,"I have been practicing yoga daily for several years and consider myself intermediate. I ordered this dvd based on the reviews I read. I must say, those were misleading. I believe this is for the advanced yogi/ni. That being said, it is beautifully filmed in black and white and I found Duncan to be inspirational and his fusion of styles interesting. I will definately keep this dvd in hopes of some day using it."
2,"Too tough for me, very very advanced, somehow dull.","This is just too complicated for me. It must be designed for people who have been practicing and exploring yoga regularly for more than 2 years. And when I say regularly, I mean 3-6 times a week. I also didn't like the atmosphere I found it very dark and not motivating. I didn't enjoy it. Even if I would progress, it would probably not become one of my favorite. This is probably due to a lack of affinity with the yoga master. Sorry."
2,Not traditional Ashtanga....,"I've been practicing traditional Ashtanga yoga for 14 years. I saw a clip of this video and thought it was beautiful, pleasant, and well-done. I downloaded it and was sorely disappointed. If you're a traditional Ashtanga practitioner, this is not the video for you. If you're new to yoga, or do Bikram or other variations, this is probably a good video to buy. I think Duncan Wong is talented and gifted. Yet he does not practice traditional yoga, in its purest sense. i don't know that he even claims to. This is his variation and projection of yoga and he is entitled to that. If he were to make a traditional yoga DVD done just like this one, I would buy it in a heartbeat."
4,full body workout,"The instructions are easy to follow. You don't need to do the full workout, because this dvd has the hole workout split in two also. I can fit that good into my schedule."
5,Excellent Beginer and Intermediate DVD,"This DVD provides an excellent range of beginner and intermediate yoga exercises. This was my first yoga DVD, and it was a great introduction. I have purchased a few DVD since this one, and they don't compare. There are enough chapters in this DVD to keep you busy! Enjoy!"
4,Great product,"Great product for places with no outlets. The range is average, so if you are going to use it to light a stairway ( like I did ), then you will need to get two. One for the top of the stairs and one for the bottom."
1,Maxxima MLS-10 LED sensor light,"Bought 3 of these units a year ago - don't waste your money on these units. The LED lamps do not last. The first unit's two lamps went out after 3 months, the 2nd unit has one lamp out, and the 3rd unit's lamps are going dim. We purchased these to save energy and get the benefit of the long life hours of the LED lamp technology. Forget the long life of the LED lamps, it's just hype at this point. The sensor part of the unit works well but that part is worthless without the lamps working."
3,"Limited range, large",Unit is large (covers 2 outlets) and the range is not that great (not very bright). Else it works well.
1,Horrible Product and Customer Service,"We ordered three of these sensor lights to help light a stairway at nighttime. When we received our package, one of the lights did not work at all. Within a month, the second one also quit working. When we called to ask if they would replace them, we were informed that sure they'd replace them, but we would have to pay all shipping fees. They sold us duds but we were still responsible for shipping??? Within 3 months of receipt, the third light quit working as well."
2,Burned out in one month.,"When I first received 2 of these sensor lights I was most pleased. They have many features, each of which worked well. If I had rated this product initially, I would have given it a 5 star rating. One month has past, with both sensors being used at night only. One sensor still works, but the other already has one LED light completely burned out and the other half as bright as it was just one month ago. In order to replace the LED lights a specialized screw driver is required, for screws that I have not seen anywhere before. Most disappointing."
3,"works fine, just the light is a bit too weak and cold","it works as expected, just for my purpose it it a bit too weak to reach 5ft away in dark and the light temp is too cold, good for halloween :)"
2,Diamond Stud Earrings,"The item was OK, but not great. The backs of the earring arevery fragile and easily bent."
1,Not my kind of fantasy,"I guess when I read this type of book I want to put myself in the shoes of the female character, and I certainly didn't want to be in her shoes with her history of being raped. Honestly, I found the whole concept a bit disturbing. What kind of sister would send a rape victim off on a romantic vacation with a man she just met - even if it is a man the sister knows?????"
4,good read,Story was sweet and definitely worth checking out. It was a little slow at parts but a good rainy day read
4,he's tied to the bed,"Fantasy, another Blaze novel, is Lori Foster's 4th novel. When pretty, man-shy Brandi's gorgeous sister Shay gives her a five-day resort stay with hunky, sexy Sebastian as a birthday gift, she's reluctant, but is ultimately convinced to participate. It turns out Sebastian is a sensitive guy who allows her to tie him to the bed and explore him at her own pace until she has overcome the fears that are a hang-over of a past trauma. Talk about self-sacrifice! His restraint pays off, of course, and they enjoy a few days of hot sex before the vacation ends. Another week or two at crossed purposes (I could never be the woman he needs; I don't have enough money to keep her happy) before they finally realise they are made for each other."
4,Nice classic romance,"Published back in 1998 this book still represents a classic Lori Foster story. Sebastian seems like such a nice guy, can't imagine why Brandi would want to leave him at the end of their retreat. Good for Sebastian for sticking with it."
2,From Back Cover,"SOLD!Sexy security consultant Sebastian Sinclair brought a princely sum at auction. And for the next five days he was going to be a boy toy for some rich woman. At least it was for a worthy cause... and the woman was intriguing.SOLD OUT!The last thing Brandi Sommers wanted was to fly off to a lover's retreat with some gorgeous mountain of a man. But Sebastian was an outrageously expensive birthday gift from her dear, meddling sister, and she couldn't very well return him. Besides, she would be in control at all times... she thought.""[Brandi Sommers is the sister of Shay Sommers from The Secret Life of Bryan.]"
5,A family treasure,"I am in my late 80's, having owned a copy from my early elementary school years. It was lost unfortunately by one of my four children. Since that time they are grown, with children of their own, and I have managed to secure copies similar to the original printing for each family. I am still adding to the joyfull experience of this incredible poetry book to my great grandchildren's households. I love ""The Coin"", into my hearts treasury I have slipped a coin"
1,DO NOT ASSIGN THIS BOOK!,"This book may as well be retitled ""child molestation's greatest hits."" I have a feeling enough murder, robbery, and adult rape cases have evidentiary problems to not need more than like, one molestation case in this book... yet here they are, haunting me every freaking subchapter. DO NOT assign to your students unless you are trying to emotionally terrorize the 1/3 of women and 1/6 of men who are survivors of sexual violence before age 18. Don't just assume they're grown up and can handle it without having their PTSD retriggered. I will probably get a D in this class I have skipped so much of the reading."
5,What I think....,"I think this is the best film Valentino ever did! His acting in the romantic scenes lacks the over the top feel that the loves scenes in ""The Sheik"" have. He brings a sincere, believeable quality to the character. Also, something that the reviews here seem to miss is the comedic moments in the film. In the scene when the black Moor servant offers to light Valentino's cigarette... the look on his face is priceless! Having the video of this film as well I noticed several scenes on the DVD edition that were missing from the VHS edition.The DVD edition also includes a wonderfully funny piece of Will Rogers' ""Blood And Sand"" spoof."
4,Wow.,"Whoa. I have got to say. ""Blood and Sand"" was the very first slient flim I didn't have to sing the ""boring"" song for. I mean, the acting was great, the screeplay was awesome (considering it was based on my favorite book.). The directing was good, too. In fact, there was nothing wrong with it-only the slience! It's true. Even the young people, I think, would like it."
3,What's the Big Deal About Valentino?,"I watched this video for the sole purpose of seeing the legendary Rudolph Valentino for the first time. I was curious to see if he lived up to the legend. Sorry to say, I don't get it. Maybe it's because I'm a guy, or maybe it's because the film itself isn't that great. It's basically the story of a young bullfighter (Rudy) who is torn between the good woman he married and the vamping (and overacting) bad woman whom he lusts after. The scenes with the bulls are pretty good, but the rest of it doesn't come of as well eighty years later as it may have when this film first came out. Valentino is competent enough, but I have to ask, ""What's the big deal?"""
1,Avoid this Product,"Although I did not have the same problem with the compressor as the other reviewer, mine does not over heat, it is still not very good. The amount of paint you can get with this system is very minimal. I tried numerous times to get an even consistent flow, cleaning regularly and making all the adjustments mentioned in the documentation, still the paint came out blotchy or did come out at all with almost every pass. The plastic nozzles clog very easily and seem to stop working altogether after 10 minutes of use. Cleaning doesn't help. Avoid this product, it's not worth the money even at a deep discount."
3,The title is misleading,"This is a knitting pattern book. There are only 4 for crochet, and two of those are beginner's. If you like knitting, this will be a 4 or 5-star book for you. Otherwise, keep looking."
5,Family Circle: Easy Sweaters,Great book! Many wonderful patterns in this book. I still would have a instructual manual with it. That is just me...
3,"Bland designs, but useful","Whether a design strikes you as interesting is a matter of taste, so it's hard to pass judgement, but I was disappointed when the book arrived. I bought it because I have some old issues of the Family Circle Easy Knitting magazine and liked the patterns, but I thought this book contained the dullest ones. The majority seem to have an oversized fit, dropped shoulders, and/or knit with bulky yarn, three features that I don't like. They also use colors I don't care for, but that's easy to change.I was set to send it back when I took a second look and decided there were a few things I could see myself wearing, and there were a few things I could see other people wearing. The shaping is simple. There are patterns for children and men as well as women.Overall a good beginner/unchallenging intermediate book, just not exciting or innovative. Vogue's Very Easy Knits is more interesting, but also a notch more difficult."
2,Not for crocheters,"Agree completely with prior review that says they should have just stuck to knitting. Putting 4 out of 50 patterns in the book for crochet is silly. Either make it more even (say 20 out of 50?) or drop the few crochet projects and just call it a knitting book. The reason I give it two stars is that the patterns are nice, and I might do one. But 1 out of 50 isn't super."
3,Not the best book,"I love the cover sweater and will probably make it. There are a couple more in the book that I will try, but it is not the best written book out there."
1,Easy Sweater Book,"I was disappointed in this book. Even though it says knit and crochet, I was hoping for more crochet patterns. Most of it is knitting. The book is not misrepresented, but hard to tell just by looking at the cover what is inside."
5,Good Junk~,"I just saw these guys at Sugarhouse Park in Salt Lake City over the 4 of july weekend, and all I have got to saw is WOW~~~~ The sond that really stands out is #6 on this cd ""Comin' Back Again"" It was the coolest thing LIVE~~~~ I definately rank these guys way up with the top a cappella groups~~~"
1,Very disappointed!,"Though this weeder arrived quickly, I was most disappointed. It is indeed a sturdy tool, but it is far too arched to produce any results at all & I found it impossible to get any leverage to even get one weed eliminated. It's quite sharp & I found it more potentially dangerous for me than helpful. No...I would have to give this an F for a rather expensive tool."
4,I like Olie!,"I like this book very much, but it's not as much of a favorite for the 2 year olds that I bought it for. They enjoy the board books more. I think part of the problem is the funky type that the words are written in. The other part may be that I'm willing to let younger hands be rougher with board pages than I am with paper pages. I'm a big fan of Olie."
4,GREAT,I bought this retro book for my husband as we have just become parents for the first time. He loves it!
1,14 months,"I purchased the Steinhausen TM483 on line and it broke down after 14 months. I contacted the Steinhausen company and they offered to fix it for $90.00 plus return shipping, which was getting close to the total cost of a new one. I'd stay away from these as I expect alot more use out of a somewhat expensive winder than a 14 month period."
3,They do not understand Innate Intelligence - the source,Innate Intelligence is the entity that made your body in the womb and it is still there maintaining your body in life and health. It must have a clear nervous system to maintain life and health. The Innate Intelligence works within the body and it can work externally in mystical ways. This is not understood by the average person and the medical profession ignores it because it would be too simple for maintaining health and their profession could not sell drugs and surgeries. All the healing arts are a business and businesses are designed to make money. Think about it!
1,Did not stream,Unfortunately it did not stream and kept freezing up. We were not able to see the movie in the 24 hour period.
5,Extremely intertaining.,"As you may or may not know this movie is one is a series. The acting is outstanding. The plot and the twist and turns make it extremely exciting to watch. A must have movie not just this one, but the whole series."
2,Nothing Extended Here,"If you already own ""The Bourne Identity"" on DVD, you do NOT need to buy this extended version. There are only two additional scenes: a weak opening scene and a slightly alternate ending. The worst part about the two scenes is that they are still in the raw form: grainy with bad sound quality. It makes no sense to promote an ""Extended Edition"" and not finish/polish the two scenes. Univeral Studios really cheaped out on this one."
3,Poor video transfer spoils an otherwise worthy library addition,"The video transfer of this film is too dark, but an adjustment to your TV brightness setting will yield an acceptable viewing. The extras are quite informative especially the part dealing with Ludlum's knowledge of the intelligence community."
3,Call it Something Else. !,"This movie has just come out on DVD in Australia.I wasn't going to watch it because I had read all the reviews of the script etc etc, and I was not impressed with the way it changed the story so much from the book, especially the fact that the bad guy in the book does not even exist in the movie.But I rented it anyway.I can say that I was pleasantly surprised. It's not too bad.Now... if they could change the beginning, change his name and the title of the movie, along with the one or two scenes that are actually in the book, it would have been GREAT.This has virturally nothing to do with the book other than the very basic plot. If you have read the book, pretend that this movie is not the same story. It's another and different Spy story.I was really looking forward to an updated version of the old mini series, this is not it. Maybe next time."
3,Fun movie...,"The first time I watched this movie I really didn't like it, based mainly on the ending. Watching it again, though, I found it is an enjoyable flick with nifty action and a decent job by Matt Damon in staying in character. Some parts seemed a little slow and drawn out between him and Franka Potente, but it didn't take away too much from the film.The DVD itself has good features for anyone looking for a little extra. Overall it was a good film to sit down to and not concentrate too hard on, though it makes you feel that it is more complicated than it really is."
2,Bourne in name only!,"My first reaction was ""Is this the right movie""?If you've read the book, or even seen the original ""Bourne"" movie, this is sure to disappoint!I liked a few elements of this movie,.... The action was okay, but the main character was too young to strike you as the ruthless and capable Jason Bourne. Also, to me, he kept whining all the way through the movie. By the end, I was hoping they'd shoot him!If you've watched the first movie, or if you've read the book... don't bother with this pale reflection......"
2,What happened to the rest of the story?,"If you want a more faithful adaptation (and I use the term lightly), you will have to suffer through the old mini-series starring Richard Chamberlain. Although, Damon is definately a cut about Chamberlain as an actor, the screenplay for this version of the Bourne Identity takes too much license with original plot. Important incidents are glossed over in favor of action scenes. And it seems the screenwriter only read two thirds of the novel because the last 80 or so pages are completely missing from this film. Dissappointing."
2,Is this really still connected to Robert Ludlum's book?,"I can understand that a story can be freely adapted but this movie is something completely different from its source even if it is still mentioned in the credits ... Robert Ludlum should be upset!They even changed Jason's character making him the killer he was only feigning to be; then they also suppressed his opponent, Carlos, who was the reason itself for Jason's existence!!!The book was a real thriller while this is only a MINOR action movie at the same level of those from Jean-Claude Van Damme :-("
5,Prompt and affordable,I received the DVD promptly and in the advertised condition. I am quite happy with the entire transaction.
3,The Boure Identity. Ok Movie.,"It's an Okay movie with Matt Damon!(Team America LOL) I have not read the book(I don't read novels), So I don't know if it's true to the book or not.Movie is a bit far-fetched,kinda of bond-ish. Matt Damon is boring, Some good Action Though. Matt Damon!"
2,"Great movie, poor HD-DVD transfer","The transfer to HD fails to meet my expectations. Sure, the picture is better than DVD but I expect more for a movie with such a huge fan base. I think they will have to re-master this and re-release the trilogy in some kind of box set. Save your money for that. I strongly disagree that this is a ""A must buy for HD DVD owners"" or that it ""looks 10 times better"". The film looks grainy, if this was re-mastered or intentional I find the result to be annoying. Universal did not bother to include a Dolby TrueHD track or alternative high resolution audio format that takes advantage of the HD format. I would only recommend buying this movie if you can not rend the HD version, don't already own the DVD and can't wait for a better re-mastered version to be released."
3,Can't compete with the real thing,"First, the good news. Matt Damon makes a great Bourne, even better than Richard Chamberlain, whom I really liked in the prior version.The bad news is the departures from the book. I suppose I could get past the stock ""CIA-assassination-team"" theme, but what I can't get over is the way they turned Bourne from a good guy who lost his memory into a bad guy who lost his memory. Ludlum (or his family agent) was executive producer, so there's no excuse. Shame on them for doing that. Actually, shame on them for underutilizing Julia Stiles too."
3,"Lots of action, but strangely unmoving","My wife and I watched this on DVD. We were disappointed that it was available only in ""full screen"" format -- i.e. with the edges chopped off -- but decided to view it anyhow. She liked it more than I did. The premise is intriguing, but its potential is not realized. After a while I didn't really CARE who Bourne is, or was. Matt Damon's acting is wooden, and the endless chase-fight-escape sequences just aren't believable. At one point, I half expected the big secret to be that Bourne is a cyborg, or specially enchanced human (a la ""The Six Million Dollar Man"") as this is the only plausible explanation for his invincibility. But no, he's just a man. Overall, it's not a bad movie; it's just not very good either."
4,Lots of action,"Matt Damon plays a CIA agent who loses his memory. Through the few clues that he can piece together, he begins the quest to find out who he is, and he's not too pleased at what he finds out. By his side is a German woman who helps him escape imminent danger by giving him a ride to Paris. This is a fast-paced, exciting movie that keeps the viewer's attention. My main objections lie with the casting of All-American boy Matt Damon as a cold-blooded killer and the fact that without knowledge of the book, it's difficult to follow the CIA wheels within wheels. Still, it's an entertaining movie."
5,Fantastic Flic,I loved this movie. It kept my interest the entire time and it was thrilling and exciting and suspensful. Matt Damon does a great job and looks good doing it. As a collector of DVD's this is a definate addition to my collection.
4,Great Plot and Action Make Up for Damon's Lack of Acting,"The Bourne Identity was a great movie for two reasons, a great plot and some of the most entertaining action sequences this year. But lately it seems that Matt Damon can't seem to find a role he's fit for, Good Will Hunting was great but since then it seems he's gone downhill. The movie centers around a hitman who can't remember anything about who he is, all he knows is that he has a bank account number implanted in his hip and he can take down anyone who trys to take him on. So he travels around until he finally finds the truth. The supporting cast is great but it seems that Damon can't find the right attitude for his role but it's still a more then worthy alternative to recent garbage like Regin of Fire."
5,"Superb Spy Movie, and an answer to Matrix","One of the best spy movies I've seen to date. Matt Damon and director Doug Liman carry this movies great screenplay to a great film. What makes the movie work is the high intensity---but steady--action sequences. The adrenaline is their but its not so high as detract from the story--there is no high so there isnt a low. Thats what makes the film work, a strong steady pace of intriguing story, great camera work, and Matt Damon. I would definitly recommend The Bourne Identity, especially if your getting sick of Matrix sequences."
1,Boring Identity,"5, 10, 15 minutes in I'm thinking this looks really promising. That comes to a train-wreck of an end when Damon eyes a young lady. One cliche after another and their on the road together. The film looks good and is well excecuted by director Doug Liman. The story however is slow and predictable just a short way in to it. The extras are good - including commentary, an alternate ending, and deleted scenes. But the relationship is dumb and it takes the movie down for me. For a good Matt Damon film about relationships however strange they maybe check out 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' co-starring Jude Law."
1,Has nothing to do with the book ...,"This movie is only surpassed by ""The Jackal"" (with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere) as the worst remake of an action/spy movie. Apart from the fact that the main character is named ""Jason Bourne"", is found floating in water, and has a swiss bank account, this movie has nothing to do with the book on which it is based. The suspense in the book is replaced by Matt Damon ripping apart a US consulate and a cheap car chase scene where he outruns Paris' finest in a rusty old Mini Cooper ...If you want to see the movie based on the book, get the made for TV version with Richard Chaimberlain instead. That movie is very true to the book, and infinately better than this.Now, the movie is actually a decent action movie. I'd give it 3 stars if it hadn't been for the reasons above."
3,Summer Spies,"The movies have been so bad this year that it's good to have fun at the movies again. Not that there aren't silly moments in this derivative spy movie, but the European locations and some of my favorite actors (Franka Potente, who has blossomed into a really beautiful woman, Julia Stiles, and Chris Cooper) make this one fun throughout."
4,a little dissapointing,This movie was very good but didn't have the characters in the book. One of the main characters Carlos wasn't in the movie. But the action was very good. I love the part where Jason grabs that guy and uses him as a cousion for the fall. All in all this is a must see movie.
1,HORRIBLE!!,"The only thing that this movie and the book have in common is the name Jason Bourne. It does not follow the chronological order of the book. The name Carlos the Jackal is NOT even mentioned. They do not mention that Marie is a PHD, and she willingly joins him. He tells her everything from the get go. In the book he kidnaps her and does not come clean until near the end. The closing scene in the book at the safe house is not even in the movie. Based on this movie they have no intention of doing the next two books. It is almost impossible. This movie is as far away from the book as it can get."
2,help! i've forgotten my movie cliches!,"I will try to keep this short and sweet. The action sequences are well done (the camera work actually makes Damon look like he can disarm multiple assailants). Unfortunately, the plot is full of holes and leaves you feeling unsatisfied. First, how likely is it that a trained killer will have a change of heart at the crucial moment? (maybe after he's slaughtered the whole family). Second, I still don't know how/why Damon/Bourne suffered from amnesia. It's true that he suffered from some trauma, but complete oblivion? Give me a break. Finally, why on earth did Potente (sp?) stay with Bourne/Damon and risk her life and that of her family? It makes no sense whatsoever. At least with a cheesy Bond flick you know that you are in the realm of the absurd and that you should just sit back and accept implausiblity after implausibility. But when a movie makes a claims towards verisimilitude/reality, and fails miserably, then it deserves to be panned."
3,Action Galore,"This isn't high art, but it's not intended to be high art. It is Action, Action, Action! Nonstop mayhem in this film. There is literaly never a dull moment. The car chase is the best I've seen since Bullitt and The French Connection.You do have to overlook a few things: How can a guy with 2 bullet holes in his back do heavy labor, chin ups, and acrobatics? How come his clothes are so neat and clean after sleeping on the street, and he doesn't need a shave?One thing I would change is the ending. It is way too Hollywoodish. It would have been much better with some sort of twist at the end."
2,What a Farce!,"This movie did not even come close to the original plot of Robert Ludlum's excellent book. I can't beleive that Ludlum would be involved in the production of this movie, to have his name in the credits. What a farcical attempt at making a spy movie. Even ""James Bond"" movies have been better, all of them!"
1,New Title: The Boring Identity,"This movie should've been called ""The Boring Identity"" because it is boring. This movie presents itself as an awesome action movie, but it is not. The action sequences are not at all spectacular, the story is so complicated and sometimes doesn't make any sense. If you want to see a movie around the same genre, go see ""XXX"", and wait until this movie gets on HBO. By the way, the girl is ugly. The DVD is very disappointing with a making-of that doesn't even show how they made the movie, but shows only actors talking about how great the movie and the director are. There is a alternate ending so stupid, it is gonna make you run to the store to get you cash back. This is very boring, I suggest that we prey to God so that Hollywood doesn't make a sequel."
1,Bour-ing,"... I was anxious for this to end very early into the movie. It was not that entertaining at all. If you want a good movie for 2002, check out Signs. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie will just make you want to leave your seat!"
3,Read the Book!,"The movie was good, but the book was fantastic!! Unfortunately, the book and the movie are almost two totally different stories. The girl even has a different background, and Carlos never enters the story at all. Enjoy the movie as its very own story and forget that it's based on a book (because it really isn't). Was Ludlum consulted I wonder? I LOVE the Bourne Supremacy book, but I'm going to TRY and not compare it to the movie that's coming out soon."
4,Bourne to be Wild!,"Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, a 30 million Dollar weopon that went bad. He now is being chased by his employers after an assasination went bad, and something else happened also, he has lost his memory.Jason Bourne has to duck and dodge police men, while trying to find out his past. This movie is filled with great acting and a great storyline. Before seeing this movie I suggest reading the book. That way you will have a little bit of a background before watching the movie.The DVD has great special features are great, I bought this movie last week and I'm still watching the deleted scenes and the behind the scenes feturette is marvellous. When they say this is a Collectors edition they MEAN IT!If you like action movies then the bourne Idenity is for you!Colin Nickell"
2,Flipper Disc,Watch out for this version of the Blu Ray + DVD. This is a Flipper Disc meaning one side of the disc is the Blu Ray and on side of the disc is DVD. You shouldn't have a problem if this kind of thing doesn't bother you. I just wish they'd say it on the package so those of us that are bothered by it would know.
5,A great movie !!!!!,"This was an awesome movie!. I have very high expectations for spy type movies and this one goes above and beyond. I've never read the book but the movie was spectacular. I saw it the theatre so I haven't bought yet, but i can't wait to watch it again. THIS MOVIE IS TRULY WORTH THE MONEY!!!!"
4,Surprisingly good heart,"Here's the film ""Mission Impossible 2"" wishes it could have been. It's the story of a near-corpse who is rescued floating in the ocean and can remember everything but who he is, what he does with his life, and how he got there.Yeah, the amnesia angle certainly has a bad rep, but the stylish film keeps the action rolling and makes it work. Unlike MI2, there's no rock-video posing, no plot holes the size of Hummers, and no escapes from sticky situations that would make 007 blush. It all fits.And ultimately the mystery is solved for us all, of course, in a legit fashion that shows this action spy flick to have a surprisingly good heart. The endings (both of them) seemed a bit too cutesy for me, and in two or three places the pacing of the film seems like the editing was done with the theory ""Let's cut to some action so they can't think about what a stretch that bit of business was,"" but all in all this is certainly one of the better films of its genre in recent memory."
5,The Bourne Identity,This movie was a constant brain stimulator. You were along for the ride trying to find out who he was and who was enemy and who was friend. Matt Damon has the talent to carry this remake of the old movie. After seeing the movie I had to go home and dig out the book for a reread. the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie.
4,The Bourne Identity,"In the vein of ""keep-you-guessing"" movies like the excellent MEMENTO, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an exciting movie with enough fast-paced action to sustain audiences during the action movie madness that is Hollywood. The film rests largely on Matt Damon's shoulders and thankfully he has enough acting chops to make you believe the character. The compelling story lends itself well to a film, which, while not completly an out-and-out action thriller, contains some fantastically contrived set-pieces, like the exciting car chase and the final showdown where Bourne finds the answers to the thorny problem of who he actually is. One of the few brainy action films of late, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is one exciting ride."
3,3 Star at Best. (RENT IT!),"This movie is a must-rent,nothing more nothing less! It was ok, but I thought the story was going to be so much more interesting/deeper. I mean I hate to give the story away so I wont say what happened. But its not as ""conspiracy-Don't Trust Anybody"" type of story. Its more like the CIA trying to correct a mission gone wrong, so to speak. And the Alternate Endings are basicly the same as the original, they'll just change like if Matt Damon Runs or walks, or what he has in his hand, etc. And the Deleted scenes just shows wasted footage, not really missing anything. I'd say Rent this."
4,Bourne Identity,You must sit down and watch this with all three movies together. A way to spend the day when you don't have much else to do. Grab a few steaks have a barbeque with some friends and have a movie marathon.
2,Don't buy the hype!,There is absolutely nothing and I mean nothing explosive about the extended edition. It has a slightly different begining and a modified ending. But it is boooooring. Don't waste your money. The theatrical release version is a better bet.
1,Extended DVD is not up to the mark,"The movie is a piece of art. One of my all time favorites. The Extended edition DVD is very badly compiled. The Bonus features are sub par with bad video quality. The alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film, and do not have the BI look and feel. Other special features are small and without much substance. The extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended. It is not a director's cut (the DVD states this upfront in the opening credits) so it not fun to watch. Don't get this if you are looking for a LOTR style extended edition."
3,Not for Ludlum lovers,"If you haven't read the book, you'll probably enjoy the movie.If you are a real fan of the Ludlum books, however, pass up this movie. It wanders much further away from Ludlum than it has to, and the sequel is even worse. Get the Richard Chamberlain version instead."
1,DVD didn't work in any dvd players,Very dissatisfied. I was very disappointed that this dvd didn't work in any dvd players or on my lap top. I was so looking forward to watching this movie and was very upset it didn't work.
5,Wow,"Based upon Robert Ludlum's book. Played by a couple of excellent actor. This movie was absolutely great from the beginning to the end.A man wakes up and finds himself in a ship. He can't remember a thing not even his name. He's lost and he'll have to find himself including his identity. But how's that possible when he is haunted by people with the very ""same"" problem!The greatest thriller I've seen in years and I watch movies in daily basis.HIGHLY Recommended"
1,"Great movie, but .....",Great movie but it does not include either spanish audio or spanish subtitles in HD version. What is happening with Universal Studios? Why do they include spanish subtitles in standard dvd version and not in HD version. It stinks.
2,Boring,The Bourne movies are extremely boring. The pacing is slow and the plots are uninteresting. Jason Bourne is an unlikable character and has no personality what so ever. I honestly cannot understand why anyone likes these movies. Instead of this movie series I recommend Casino Royale which is a lot more thrilling.
4,Second to Bond,"The Bourne Identity is a superb action movie. The plot was well thought out and it keeps the viewer guessing what is going to happen next. Meanwhile, Matt Damon (as Jason Bourne) has no clue what is going on. All he knows is that people are trying to assassinate him. Towards the middle of the movie it became very intense. Bourne's agency sent out three agents to kill Bourne. At this point Bourne must combat these guys. Each guy is fought in a different way, separating this movie from the typical action movie. The first agent is fought through a stealth type mission out in an open field. Both agents crawl around the field, unaware where each other is. It seemed like Metal Gear to me. Next he fights another agent through a hand to hand combat followed by a straight shoot out.This movie is a combination of action and drama. It is not a non-stop action thriller but yet is sure to keep your interest because you don't know what is going to happen next."
2,The talented Matt Damon,"With so many meaningless action movies nowadays, most of them are just pieces of fight sequences glued with weak acting and nonexistant plot. ""The Bourne Identity"" is not a bad action movie, but never steps above average material either. Matt Damon is ok as the lost Jason Bourne and Doug Liman knows how to make some creative and credible action sequences, but the plot is still typical and not very different from so many other spy films. The predictable ending doesn`t help, either.While it is moderately entertaining, ""The Bourne Identity"" never achieves that ""something"" that could make it a must-see. A well-made product, but not much else. Let`s wait for the sequel."
5,Bourne Ultimatum HD-DVD,"I have watched this movie twice (HD-DVD) as well as in the theatre. I keep seeing things I missed each time I watch it. Very good, exciting movie and it's excellent in HD-DVD. I highly recommend it."
4,Really good movie despite hollywood ending,"I'm not a huge Matt Damon fan, and I certainly didn't think he could pull off an action role, but I was wrong. ""The Bourne Identity"" is a fun movie loaded with great action sequences and scenery (the farmhouse scene in particular). Franka Potente was absolutely wonderful as Damon's female sidekick. Hope to see more of her."
2,You get seasick from the camera motion!,"It could have been a good movie, pretty good plot. But the producer opted for lots of filler - violence instead of good acting and camera action so fast it makes you dizzy from not being able to focus on a scene for more than 1/10 of a second! Watched it to the end, but was disappointed with the lack of real quality. Really hated that most of the movie involved the camera swinging back and forth, up and down and around. It was enough to give one a seizure!"
4,Good action movie.,Would recommend this to all action crazed audiences and spy flick lovers. I would also recommend the other sequals to this movie.
4,Great spy movie with amazing shots of Paris and fight scences,"The Bourne Identity is a great spy movie with great job by Damon as the main character. The movie itself keeps your intrest all the way threw from start to finish. What did it for me was the fight and car chase scences, I mean having high car chase scence threw heart of Paris priceless. Plus the stunts in the movie helps make the movie amazing and very enjoyable. So if you yet to watch this movie pick it up and savor a great spy flick with amazing shots of country side and city of Paris, plus great acting by the actors in it and action scences that will blow you away everytime you watch it."
5,The Best of its Genre,"The Bourne series, absent the latest rendering without Damon, is addictive. I have seen each of the three films five or more times. The Bourne Identity is the best of the three and among my five all-time personal favorite movies."
4,A Bourne Franchise,"The Bourne Identity (2002) is one of this years most unusual action films, tossing aside all that is Matrix style action and going for a more old fashioned style director Doug Liman has found himself with a hit. The action style perfectly portrays the person that Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is supposed to be.After having been left for dead in the Mediterranean Sea, Jason Bourne has no idea what is name is, where he's from, or what he does. The only things he knows scare him and he must find out what he used to do before assassins kill him.With excellent plot twists, well choreographed action scenes (mostly done by Damon), good acting and an intriguing premise, the Bourne Identity is a movie that belongs in any action lover's collection.The only thing that really keeps the DVD from receiving a 5 out of 5 is the extras are less than great, deleted scenes have not been put together very well, and the extras are sparse in general.That said I can't recommend this film enough. Buy it now."
4,"A major departure from the book, but still worthwhile","I was disappointed when I found out the movie was loosely based on my favorite Robert Ludlum novel. Once I got over that, I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining the movie was. Rather than rely on gimmicky special affects and things of that nature that plague so many of todays movies,it makes use of solid acting, a good story, and action scenes that feel like you are in the middle of them. I also enjoyed some of the quirkly humorous scenes throughout. A good ole fashion spy story!"
3,Not the best movie this summer...,"Is it me,or are they making way too many movies about amnesia?!This movie,(in my opinion),bears a stricking resemblance to the Jackie Chan film ""Who Am I?"".In ""The Bourne Identity"",Jason Bourne doesn't know who he is or how he knows karate,and,I don't know about you all,but if I want to see some guy [fight],I want to see a guy that knows what he's doing,not beat up two guards,then wonder how the heck he just did that.So,overall,it was a pretty good movie.I give it a 3 out of 5."
2,Cliche to the maximum.,"Everyone keeps talking about how cliche this movie is, but then they add in ""the fact that Damon plays a spy with amnesia on the run is the most original thing about this movie"" and how wrong could they be? I guess no one seems to remember a movie starring Gena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson called 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' where Davis plays a spy with amnesia, and she eventually teams up with Jackson, with whom she barely knows, and they are on the run from Davis's former employee. Despite good (but done-before) action sequences the movie just falls short. Matt Damon played a better role than expected (it was kind of hard to accept him as an action star) but still, the movie is completely and tiredly unoriginal. For action fans who don't mind seeing the same old thing over again, I will suggest it. But for those of you looking for something new, I would skip this and wait until it came out on video. It's just not that great."
2,Wait... Did I miss something?,"Truth be told, I was completely excited to see this movie. After watching the riveting previews, I bought the book to read before hand. Wow! the book was fantastic! But getting to my point. This movie feels like one long preview. There's some epic on your seat chase scenes, and heart warming reunions, but you keep thinkin gto yourself, wait, did I miss something? this can't be the actual movie right? it seems Matt Damon, (giving the best performance he could do with this minimal plot) runs around the whole movie, and can't figure out what the point was. This is nothing like the book, and you're most likely going to be better off reading it than seeing the movie. If you are like me, you will finish it staring blankly at the screen, and saying:Huh?Your better off watching the preview, it just about explains the whole movie."
2,Marie's Review,"I watched this movie. I expected that I would love it, just by looking at the title. Well It was all chase. But who was chasing who? And why were who chasing who? The movie needs a story. It needs content. It needs to be interesting. I don't recommend it. Even my 25 year old son didn't like it. I wish I could say something good. But I didn't like it."
2,You've seen this all before,"You've seen all these elements a hundred times before: karate fights, shootings, car chases, romantic interludes.... It gets kind of old, doesn't it? The director throws all the elements above into a Waring blender, crossing his fingers that the resulting incomprehensible mishmash will prove ""exciting"" and marketable. This movie relies upon holding back information from the audience--information needed to understand the motives and actions--to represent itself as mysterious. To be fair, the sound engineering and editing are high quality, but breathless pace alone does not make a good movie."
2,Disgusting.,"When I first watched this movie, I had not read the book (an excellent story by Robert Ludlum). I could not figure out what was going on. The movie seemed to be a lot of this guy (Matt Damon, who does not belong in this role, I'm sorry) running around and making out with this girl. There was no dicernable plot, no recognizable conclusion.Then I read the book, and was horrified. I have truly never seen a worse butchering of a book by a movie, except perhaps Girl, Interrupted. Not only were the characters distorted and flattened and the plot garbled and spliced, the most important character was left out ENTIRELY.Read the book instead. If you haven't read it, you will wonder what the heck is going on. If you've already read the book, you will want to hit your head on large amounts of concrete.Don't watch this movie."
2,"Smart plot,baaaad characters...","This movie feautures a very smart plot,supported by a talented director,but is ruined by the really bad characters.You can't understand how they think,and worst of all,you can't like them.Especially Bourne.I mean,what's up with the guy?He's the ''good guy'',but he's always angry,shaking innoccent people just because things are not like he wants them to me.I've seen ''anti-heroes'' in films before,but not in action films,and not like that!He even bumps his girlfriend's back on the door at some point!Sorry Liman,but my opinion is that if the characters are bad,so is the film."
1,Why?,"This is a decent movie if you live in a cave and have never seen a spy movie. Its main plotline is basically a gawky-teenager like spy fumbling his way through the movie trying to figure out who he is and how he got there. he, as well as the movie are completely laughable. The special effects are non-existant, the plot is thin, and unless you are a huge Damon fan then this movie is about as enjoyable as gigli."
1,Sucked,"This movie sucked a$$. There is no way that i would ever see this dvd again or recomend it to anyone. Stupid, cofusing, just dumb all around, no funny parts at all. I DO NOT reccomend this dvd!"
2,slow moving and predictable,"this was one of those movies where i knew the ending well in advance. from the previews, you can get the idea of the plot. matt damon plays a man trying to discover who he is. there are people out to kill him for something he did that we have yet to know.i knew this and yet the movie, i found, was slow because it took almost an hour to get any info about him. i knew he was some spy or something and probably did some dirty deed or maybe refused to do something for someone.yet the movie saw fit to dwell on this for far too long. i was bored, waiting for the movie to pickup, to explode in action and bring me to edge of my seat. of course this never happened. this was a below average movie in which i found no joy"
1,Amazon need help,Boure Identity - rate it a 5. Great movie.Watching it on Amazon is the worst experience I have ever had. Having friends over to wnjoy a movie only to have it stop andstart over and over again is awful. The starting and stopping is unexpected and lasts sometime for hours.
5,The Bourne Identity,"The movie arrived in the new condition as promised, and it arrived on time. I was very surprised to see the French writing on the front but the movie works fine and the price was great."
4,A boring Bourne,"That wasn't a brand new idea - of making a movie about super-spy lost his memories. Well, may be that happens to often? Poor guys. It's pale. Or may be even flat. No feelings. No thoughts. Even no humour. Some chase, ""Mini"" rocks, yaaawn. Boring and predictable. So Matt Damon couldn't save the movie - he had nothing to do, to play, but a couple of tricks. So the coolest thing in the whole story is that advanced ""laser pointer"". (In Russian translation they called it ""microfilm"". Ugh.) And, by the way, those attempts to put Slavic languages in the movies are boring too. You know, a super-mega-hyper-absolute-spy risks a lot, if he tries to use a passport with a senseless bunch of cyrillic letters instead of name. What a shame."
3,"Lots to see, not much for story.","The story is unbelievably poorly written (I mean the movie, not the book). This movie gives you many laughable unreal stupid scenes as a spy movie and endless questions of why. But do we care? Nice European locations like Paris, Prague, etc."
3,another spy movie,"I have a high expectation with spy films. James Bond and Mission Impossible films have raised the bar so much that good films like The Bourne Identity struggle to remain in the minds of the theater patrons (i.e. avid movie goers). This is a good action movie, and the plot is difficult enough to pass the test. But as I said previously, other spy films are just so good they make it hard for others to compete. As a result, it makes all other movies seem not so hot. I only gave Bourne Identity three stars because I have seen so many other superior spy films as well as action films. Next time Doug Limon will have to step it up a notch. Okay action earns 3 stars."
4,Good Entertainment,"Movie is about an amnesiac CIA assassin who has no memory of his name, profession, or his recent activities. He pays a penniless German traveler to assist him in solving the puzzle of his missing identity and to find out why there are a group of assassins trying to dispose of him. The plotting is intricate with good character detail and good action mixed with slight humor. Having never read the original book, I viewed the movie with no real expectations. It kept me interested. Mystery, lots of action and an interesting twist at the end make this movie worth checking out."
4,Great Flick from a chickflick girl,I thought the movie was great! I really did not want to see Bourne Identity or Supremacy. It was hubby's turn to pick the movie and that is what we watched. I loved Bourne Identity and went and rented Bourne Supremacy the next day.I like the fact that the movie was great without a lot of swearing or sex scenes. I thought they were both suspenseful and wonderfully made films.
4,German contribution...,"Damon is very dynamic as Jason Bourne. Fantastic and unexpectedly dynamic as never before, Damon along with his German girl give a terrific show especially in the action sequences. Franka Potente is excellent. It is a genuine, satisfying spy story that can make you feel pleased after watching it. Well directed and with good cast as both bad and good guys are great. The sound is also carefully designed and gives you the impression that you are followed too. It may be not so close to the book but...it is better! So don't care and enjoy!A little note that should made, for whoever didn't understand it, is that in the ending scene, the island where Damon finds his German beauty is the Greek island Mykonos!!! Have Fun!"
5,thinking person's adventure movie,"i'm not normally a fan of the espionage/action genre but there is just too much to like about bourne identity.the plot itself is excellent, with plenty of hairpin turns, suspense and surprise to engage. the ever-shifting european scenery adds another dimension. lastly, the strong performances all round, first & foremost by matt damon, make this a must-see."
4,The DVD was defective,"I liked the movie. That's why I ordered it. But when I finally tried to play it, the picture and the sound kept breaking up. I wanted to have it replaced, but I can't find a single way to communicate with anyone who can do anything about it. I can't return in unopened because I had to open it to play it to find out it was defective. It's not the DVD player because I ordered two other DVDs that are just fine.And yes, I'm over the age of 13. I'm over the age of 65 and can't afford to waste money on a DVD that won't work. You give me no recourse.Please forward this to a human being who can respond to this."
3,Bourne Conspiracy,"Okay, I'm writing this because I feel that I've been burned. I just purchased the 2004(?) re-release of this DVD and I was very disappointed. The package describes an ""explosive extended edition"" and ""includes an all-new beginning and ending"". I've got to admit that I loved the movie when it was in the theatres, and am happy that it is now in my collection, but I never would have bought it had I known the hype was so lame. The 'explosive' new beginning and ending were NOT, and really add nothing to the movie (I won't 'spoil' the 'surprise' for those die-hard fans). Plus they couch the reasons for excluding them from the theatrical release in some 9/11 mumbo-jumbo that was not clearly defined enough to understand. I think it's just a marketing ploy. If you're looking for a major addition to the original in this new release...please say, ""I wasn't Bourne yesterday!"""
2,Why waste your time,"This edition is NOT better than the first (single disc) edition. Why would they do an ""Extra Extended"" edition and leave off the DTS sound? The original (single disc) has DTS. Isn't that's what DVD is all about, great sound as well as picture quality?Don't waste your money, if you already have the original copy...keep it!"
4,Surprisingly Good,"Lots of people compare this movie with Minority Report. Both are full of action, have big stars,....are now both on DVD. Anyway, while I did enjoy Minority Report...lots...it's good, trust me, for my money I pick Bourne Identity as the better of the two. You go into Minority Report with all kinds of baggage that Tom Cruise and Speilberg bring to any movie they make. Bourne Identity makes no pretentions about the uber-movie it's going to be. It's simply a fun movie to watch, with cool action scenes and a hot chick. Try it out"
3,One for the suckers...,"DO NOT BE FOOLED: This is not a bona fide ""extended"" edition. All they've done is scotch tape an extremely poor hard drive quality transferred opening and ending sequence onto the film itself. There is NO seamless branching. Not only that, but director Liman's commentary has been ELIMINATED.To be sure, this is a quality film, but understand this release for what it is: an enticement to rile up attention for the sequel - nothing more."
1,Missing 100th Anniversary Cover,I just received my copy today and it is missing it's 100th anniversary cover? What's up with that? If I just wanted the regular disk I would have ordered it (at the time it was cheaper than the 100th anniversary edition).
5,great movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie. It held up to the quality benchmark that was set by Robert Ludlum when he wrote the book. While some of the technology was updated to match the movie's more up to current timeframe, it was tastefully done and updated the story. If you are a fan of thrillers, this is a must see movie!"
3,The original background for Bourne Legacy,"It is dated now, particularly from the technology used by characters, but fun to watch before seeing Bourne Legacy now in theaters."
1,"HD DVD means old, largely unplayable format","I can't knock the vendor because the item clearly says ""HD DVD"". But be aware (as I wasn't) that HD DVD is an obsolete format. It doesn't on either my DVD player or my computer. I suppose that if PowerDVD will play this format, you could get some good deals on movies (once you spend $60 on PowerDVD). I haven't tried this.I'm cutting my loses."
3,The first seems to be always the best...,"Because after this one, the director decided to fire his DP and employ a Home Depot paint can shaker to film the next other two films. A commentator also thought the director decided to film the fights in ONE SECOND cuts to create ""exicitment"".Back on topic: This is a decent movie. Not a great one. Just decent. I liked it on the Blu, but the DvD wasn't too bad either."
3,Pales in comparison to the 1988 TV mini series,"Having first watched the 1988 TV mini series starring Richard Chamberlain, I've just come to appreciate what great film making is all about.This 2002 remake simply pales in comparison. The villain in this remake lacks substance, he doesn't feel evil, he just paces around the office like every other paranoid beauracrat. Matt Damon is pretty good in this remake, he carries the movie, but still he is not Richard Chamberlain. The female leading character is plain annoying. She comes across not so much as helpless but plain dumb and annoying. And she keeps repeating the ""S"" word in German. Is it really fashionable nowadays to repeatedly say the ""S"" word in a foreign language so it doesn't get beeped out? She must have said it like 20 times.And the director, for crying out loud, this whole movie feels like an independent film on steroids compared to the 1988 TV mini series."
3,Not bad,"This was a pretty enertaining action flick. It was about a hit man who lost his memory, and is now trying to find out why so many people are after him and why he has so many different passports. He is in for a lot of suprises. I reccomend it to any action film fan. The reason I only gave it three stars is because it had an awful ending and I didn't like the female lead."
4,Entertaining vehicle for Damon,"Based on the popular series by author Robert Ludlum, The Bourne Identity finds amnesiac CIA Agent Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the lam from assassins sent by his superior (Chris Cooper) while he recruits a down on her luck German woman (Franka Potente) to help him piece together his identity. Entertaining from start to finish, the Bourne Identity is solid crowd pleasing entertainment and a more than solid vehicle for Matt Damon who gives an excellent performance. The action can lag at some points, and it's nowhere as good as Ludlum's book, but this is still a solid mainstream action pic worth checking out. Also featuring Brian ""the original Hannibal Lecter"" Cox and Julia Stiles."
2,Did Anybody Involved in This Project Read the Book?,"I ordinarily like Matt Damon movies, but this one was an exception. I didn't like it at all. Furthermore, it was NOT ""The Bourne Identity.""If you go to this movie expecting Robert Ludlum, you're going to be sadly disappointed. There's very little connection between his book and this movie. It should have just been titled ""The Spy with Amnesia.""If you want to see the real thing, order the video or the DVD of the 1988 TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlin. That version is real Robert Ludlum.I like Matt Damon, but Robert Ludlum and I go back over years and years. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who reads Ludlum faithfully. It does little justice to his book and no justice to his memory."
3,Bourne Supremacy is Much Better,"I saw ""The Bourne Supremacy"" first, because I wanted to see Paul Greengrass' fiction after I saw his documentary, ""United 93."" And Greengrass delivered very big screen, car chases, multi-countries, a driving score! Can't say enough.Then, I thought I needed to see ""The Bourne Identity"" because of flashbacks and references made in ""Supremacy."" The only tie between the two movies are the use of the same actors. The two stories can stand alone and don't substantiate each other. After see ""Supremacy,"" you can't go back to the plodding pace ""Identity."""
1,Missing the Universal 100th Anniversary Slipcover!!,"My first order was missing the Universal 100th Anniversary Slipcover (see item description picture), got a replacement sent the very same day and received it before today but still this one also was missing the slipcover... So this one will go back for a refund.Too bad, Amazon has a great price and my two other Bourne discs that I ordered from Amazon did have the Universal 100th Anniversary slipcover."
4,Very fun Movie,"This is a very fun movie, just as good when I rewatched it last week as when I saw it in theater years ago. Die-hard Ludlum fans like myself should be aware that, just like always with Hollywood, they've changed a LOT from the original book. It's been ""updated"" and Bourne is nowhere near as conflicted as he was in the original."
3,Entertaining but should be titled something different,"I feel they should of named this movie something other than the ""Bourne Identity"" it is nothing like Robert Ludlum's novel other than it being a story of a secret agent that loses his memory. The movie is good by action and suspence point of view, but if you are like me and love Ludlum's ""Bourne Identity"" it is nothing close. I was vastly disappointed. If you haven't read the book, read it! Even though it was written in the '70's, it is still a good story. I did think the casting of the characters were better than the 1988 movie, though I thought he 1988 movie was more aligned with the Ludlum's novel."
2,DIShonesty in advertising,"I enjoyed both the book and the movie. The movie, fortunately, bears virtually no relationship in plotting to the book, as the book would be out-dated (or, use intelligence-community jargon, ""overtaken by events"").The ""Explosive Extended Edition"" is, by amazing coincidence, exactly the same length as the UNExplosive, UNExtended Edition.I had thought the ""EEE"" would be the Director's Cut, or something similar. It is not.If you already own the original DVD version, purchasing this would be a waste of your money, unless you want to buy a back-up copy.Still, I hope plans are in the works to film ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", the 3rd of the Bourne trilogy. (There is also a 4th book, ""The Bourne Legacy"", but that was not written by Robert Ludlum.)"
1,"Wrong title, but the movie is ok","It is VERY loosely adapted from the Bourne Identity and not much related to the book. I like the book very much, it's like a Harry Potter for adults, you need to read all of it to know what happens, reading the front and end doesn't make you wiser.If you are interested in the movie The Bourne Identity, I'd suggest the version with Richard Chamberlain acting. In my opinion, a Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford would be better suited for the role of Jason Bourne."
1,Flipper Defect Nightmare,"Universal decided to put flippers back on the market rather than pack in a DVD copy into a 2 disc case. Ooooh. Bad move. No more disc art, defective discs everywhere (rampant reports of Bourne Identity freezing for 15 seconds during a car chase are already surfacing). Universal executives, if you are watching....PLEASE STOP THE FLIPPERS. THEY WERE BAD IN DVD DAYS. THEY ARE BAD NOW. Pack in the DVD with the blu ray in the future, your end-of-year bonus check and family will thank you"
1,A Real Yawner......Don't Waste Your Time!,"I started watching this on a weekend away with 2 other couples. By the time it was 20 minutes into it, I was the only one who hadn't given up and gone to bed! It's very slow, and the ending is a letdown......it just sort of, ends. No real character development, you don't really care what happens to the characters. There are much better choices out there."
2,Matt Damon,"Maybe it's just me, but I think I've seen cars that give their lines with more soul than Matt Damon. The story seems weak as well. I have no desire to watch this again, but if the wife was to pop it in the DVD player, I might not leave the room."
4,Above average action film,Let me begin by saying I didn't read the novel. I see a lot of reviews here that their major gripe that is not faithful to the book. It's probably true since Hollywood loves doing that. A good example are the Tom Clancy novels.Nonetheless I thought this film was a pleasant surprise. I expected the film to be a stinker but wasn't. I enjoyed the suspense and the many action sequences that they performed. Matt Damon is really good in this film and maybe the next generation action hero. He doesn't do anything super human just a lot of intelligence and cleverness. The supporting cast was solid but the show is all Matt Damon.The only thing that was disappointing was the ending seemed kinda hacked on but that to me was a minor problem. It's a good summer flick.
3,Book or Movie?,"""The Bourne Idenity"" as a movie was a prety interesting intrigue action film, but to say that it is based on the book is a stretch. Nearly the only similarities are main character names and some event sequences. I was completely surprised to discover that absolutely no major plot lines followed those of the book, beside Borne discovering his identity. I have read the first 2 books of this triolgy and now wonder as to what happens when Hollywood tries to produce a 2nd film, after destroying all platforms setup to support it by the 1st book."
3,Just OK...,"Action packed...yes...good acting...yes...a bit drawn out...yes...easy to follow...no!! This movie was good...but it was very hard to follow, it jumped around a lot!! The action scenes were excellent and it did keep me in my seat and wanting to know what was going to happen next. Special Effects were great and the leading lady was a hotty!! If you are looking for a good...not great thriller...then rent this one!"
4,Pretty much underated,"This movie does not get too many great reviews from the press, but it is a very good movie.For the spy story and such, well its good and entertaining, so I would give it a three for that. But I would give it a five for the other storyline.Its a movie that, well. maybe I should not say, but it is an intriuging back story. Well ok, I will tell, but if you do not want to know and would rather watch the movie first, by all means I recomend it and dont read past this line.Its a movie about a guy whose memory gets erased somehow and when he finds out who he is, he doesn't like it, so he trys to become a different person. Pretty intruiging, at least for me. Think about it, if you did not know who you were, then found out, would you like yourself?"
2,"If you liked the book, skip this movie","I am a huge fan of the Ludlum novel and was anxious to see the movie version. Other than the title of the movie and the name of the main character, there is very little resemblance between the outstanding novel and this very standard Hollywood action movie. And I really do not understand why the screenwriter decided to divert so dramatically from the novel. It sure was not to add more suspense -- Ludlum's novel was full of that. The movie even left out the villian of the book -- Carlos the Jackal. Hard to imagine leaving the bad guy out of a supposed spy thriller. My advice, read the book. You will enjoy that much more than this movie."
3,Bourne Identity For and Against,Those who read the Ludlum novel may feel this presentation is vaguely faithful. There is some question if Matt Damon is the right Bourne for this movie? Certainly the movie in which Richard Chamberlain played Bourne is in some ways more like what Ludlum wrote. Those familiar with Ludlum and what his novels try to communicate in themes relating to democracy and clandestine operations is not present in this movie. In short not enough love went into the making of this video and for that reason it is difficult to figure out what if any point it makes? There is plenty of action and that is the sole merit of this Ludlum movie.
1,Switch to Netflix,Did not know it took a special DVD machine to play this. No problem sending it back for credit. I signed up for Netflix and love it.
1,"Still-""Bourne""","It takes a lot of skill to make a crackling good action pic. It takes talent of a different sort to make a film this listless and dull. So dull, in fact, that I turned it off 10 minutes before the end. That's how much I didn't care. Great actors like Brian Cox, Clive Owen and Chris Cooper are completely wasted, and are we really supposed to believe that 18-year-old Julia Stiles runs the CIA's covert Paris offices? There's absolutely no chemistry between the co-stars (the director wisely pulls the camera away when they start to kiss) and Damon proves that, as good an actor as he can be (""Good Will Hunting"" and particularly that Meg Ryan/Denzel Washington pic), he's really not a movie star. A big ""who cares."""
1,A real snoozer,"First of all, I could barely follow the storyline. Secondly, Matt Damon executing all those perfect self-defense techniques? Please. Ladies, you know who we would rather see in a role like this, right? (I'll give you a hint, his first name is Arnold)This is actually a remake, and the earlier version is sturdier as far as the storytelling goes. But this movie simply does not do justice to the novel. I know, it's a common complaint, but never truer."
3,Hand Helds,The constant screen jitter from hand held cameras was enough to make me walk out of the theatre mid-movie.
3,Is it just me?,"I applaud Matt Damon for his writing abilities and The Talented Mr. Ripley was cool too but I'm not sure he's quote an action hero guy. I actually thought he was the best in Ocean's Eleven, a film I didn't love but he's not quote right for the part here."
5,Bourne Identity review,Good movie ... great series. Get all three. Action packed. Will watch it again.
3,Read the Book Instead,"That is, read the book instead if you want to read what Robert Ludlum meant ""The Bourne Identity"" to be. See this film if you want a spy thriller with a basic similarity to the novel. See the Richard Chamberlain mini-series if you want to see a good adaptation of Ludlum's book.If you watch the special features on the DVD, you get a pretty good glimpse of the evident ego of the director, which gives pretty good clues as to why this film bears so little resemblance to the book."
3,This is an ok CIA type movie.,Matt Damon is a good actor but not convincingly good in this movie. The fight action sequences are ok due to speedy camera movement which could have been realistic if Matt did his own fight sequences with normal camera movement. Matt's character does not have the magnetic power to take his audiences with him to unfold the mystery behind his amnesiac past. Better CIA scripted movies are those in which stars Harrison Ford.
4,Bourne,"This movie is great. Its extremely entertaining without lowering itself to vulgarity. It is very sad that Ludlum's masterpeice was not more fully adapted, but I don't think that anyone could adapt the book without creating a day long movie in the process. All in all this is among the best spy movies out there."
4,Very good action movie,"If you have read the book, well, you know the story, even if the movie is somewhat adapted.The action sequences are superb, Bourne is established as the best-of-the-best, even though the others sent to hunt him down don't seem as good. Franka Potente is good, she fits her character as a German-born American. Matt Damon is good too.I rented this movie, perhaps one day I will own it too (along with The Matrix!)<SPOILER?>As for the Collector's Edition, the alternate ending is probably not worth spending extra money (I don't know how much the normal edition costs). But Widescreen is better, as the movie's supposed to be seen.Maybe they will do a _good_ sequel (unlike Reloaded!), though the ending left me wondering how they would achieve that.Good cast, good director, good movie."
2,Too many unsatisfying changes of scenes,"Hum... I did not like the movie much. It was too all over the places (in other words, a little disturbing) and it was with too many unsatisfying changes of scenes for me. I felt like I was watching the sequence of bunch of action scenes. It is too bad since I like Matt Damon and Franka Potente and they are fine in the movie."
2,Don't watch if you read the book,"I went to the movies think, ""wow, this'll be great!"" I loved the book, and from it seemed from the comercial that it would be about the same. Well it wasn't. It was completely different. When I left the movie theater, I wanted to cry in a corner in fetal position with my copy of The Bourne Identity cradled in my arms. If you want to see an accurate portrayl of the book, rent the mini-series.But if you haven't read the book, I guess this movie's half-way decent."
3,"Not bad, but not faithful to the book","This movie changes some of the basic premises of the book, and not for the better. I can't really say how without spoiling the movie, but trust me -- the book is better. Read it. You won't want to put it down.However, if you haven't read the book and don't plan to, it's not a bad action flick.For a more faithful adaptation of the book, see the TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith."
4,Non stop action thriller!,This is a really great movie with action and suspense from the getgo.Matt Damon is exciting--cunning and a master of self defense--like a combination James Bond and Jet Lee. The European backdrop and scenery really adds to this motion picture.I highly recommend Bourne Identity to anyone who can appreciate a action/suspense thriller that really kicks. Great movie.
4,Loads of Fun,"This is an action thriller that is great from start to finish.A man is rescued at sea. He has no memory of who he is or anything about him. He ends up being in some very tight spots and demonstrates that he has a wide variety of impressive fighting skills.In his quest to figure out who he is, he connects with a young German woman, Marie (Franka Potente) who assists him throughout much of the show. As it goes along, he (Matt Damon) discovers that his name, or one of them, is Jason Bourne. It turns out that he is a CIA assassin. While he has amnesia, his employers think that he has gone rogue and are attempting to kill him.All of this makes for a story with lots of action. The events take place all across Europe. It is really a very entertaining film that is a good one for any fan of action flicks."
4,Action at it's Best,This thriller set the pace right from the openning credits and never let's up. The cinematography is stunning. The pace is fast but surprisingly believable. The action sequences are quick but highly effective and the one chase fits nicely within the plot. Matt Damon does a nice job. A good evening's entertainment.
4,More Ecstacy Than Agony,"While not the greatest movie ever made, The Agony And The Ecstacy is beautiful to look at. For someone who will never travel to Italy, it presents details of the Cistine Chapel not presented anywhere else. Charlton Heston is wonderful to look at even when he is dirty and sweaty and covered with paint. Turns out he is another one of those actors who never got the credit they deserve for practicing their craft. He deserved much more recognition for his talent than he got for most of his work."
5,Wonderful.,"Absolutely astonishing. Whether you are a collector of classical movie or not, this move is a must to see and have ."
4,A classic Movie.,Charlton Heston does it again...a great movie for all to watch and learn much about history.
3,Good for the artistry!,"I would not watch this film for the acting, but the depiction of the times and detail of the painting of the chapel are very good. Charlton Heston is very much over-acting (as usual), and Rex is overdoing it a bit as well (but better than Chuck). I still can't understand why Chuck is in it (an American?) other than trying to capitalize on his Moses credentials. It would have been nice if they could have expanded the painting/historical aspects more and cut down on the infatuation with the Medici woman he likes as well as some of the battle scenes. They are both unnecessary in this movie."
4,Inspiration makes master pieces. Not the money and muscle power!,"Pope wanted Michaelangelo to paint the ceiling of a church. Michaelangelo, who was a sculptor refused to do the job. Facing death threat, he ran into mountains. Drawing inspiration from the images from sky, he created a masterpiece that has been living till today.Great screenplay, only matched by war of witty words.Thank you Michaelangelo!"
3,Great Photography,"I thought the only good parts about this film besides showing the Sistine Chapel for the glorious work of art and civilisation that it is. Was that of Mr. Heston and to Mr. Harrison battling each other over the project. Otherwise it was a wooden movie, Julius has a lot more to offer than ""When will you be finished?""(The man as Pontiff led armies in person and went on Cavalry charges while hurling excommunications at his opponnets.)"
2,The Agony and the Ecstasy,"I ordered this DVD for my husband who is teaching a World History class at a local high school. We love the movie itself, but the quality of the product was sub-par. There were several times during the movie when there was an annoying scratching sound that would continue for a while. I thought this was a new DVD and not a used one, but the annoying sound during parts of it causes me to wonder about that. The speed with which we received the DVD was right on! He did get it in time to use in his class. So that's a plus. Just wanted you to know about the quality of the video itself."
3,"pretty pictures, just turn off the audio","charlton heston is a heterosexual michelangelo, and rex harrison is a warrior pope in this verrrry loooong telling of the spiritual struggle between the artist and the patron responsible for the creation of the sistine chapel. nice to look at, but an hour-long documentary on the discovery channel would be easier to take."
5,Wonderful old classic,"What can I say, other than state that this movie was superb when it was released and was a joy to watch again."
3,The story of the Michaelangelos Sistine Chapel,I was disappinted with this movie because it was only a small part of the book and Michelangelo's life. There was a lot of interesting parts left out in order to make the entire movie about the painting of the Sistine Chapel.
1,More than average...,"What a mediocre movie...No soul, surely no ecstasy at all, did they even read Stone's biographical novel before shooting this movie ? Charlton Heston is lame, Harrison too wordy and really overacting...Plus, the movie is far too artificial and Hollywoodian, you don't feel like being there, with Michelangelo in Firenze or Roma. Keep away from this one...unless you hate Michelangelo !"
2,There isn't enough room for Rex and Charlton,"Charlton Heston and Michaleangelo and Rex as the Pope(a man married seven times!). The Pope commands that Michaelangelo paint the Cistene chappel and he does so. But every few minuts Rex asks him one question, When will it be done? This is a true agony and there's little ecstasy. It's extablished that Rex and Charlton a fighting for room on screen and it was the same way off screen. Who thought of Rex as the head of the Church? Don't get it to see these two act."
1,Hollywood Junk,"Charlton Heston was as best wooden, and if you are educated enough to know the real, not the Hollywood interpretation on the life of Michelangelo you will of course know that it bears little resemblance to any factual documentary. The true story is of course far more interesting, than the puerile American dribble that is portrayed in this heap of sentimental, unintelligible, misinformed, junk."
3,great movie,"Charlton Heston when he was good - great movie theme, siubjest, and the locations are breathtaking..."
5,Gripping,"I loved it. What great characters, it would make a superb film. I cannot fathom the negative reviews on here, it is a deeply satisfying read and I want to find out what else the author has done on the strength of this book."
2,So Promising...,"After the first few pages, I loved this story. I liked the writing, and I love historical fiction. However,somewhere along the way, it seemed to degenerate into cliche and wooden, cartoon-like characters. It would have been nice to have cared more about the characters. Alas, the only sympathetic person in the story was Rose. Too bad she doesn't have a bigger role.The ending was -- well, I can't think of a better word -- horrible. There were no surprises, and the writing slipped into a pit of cheap melodrama and unbelievable dialogue. I cheered when almost everyone died. Wish they would have died sooner...."
2,A Book With No Heart Or Soul,"It's hard to say what gives a soul to a book and its characters. While one work, even a small one, will breathe, and spring to life, another simply won't. In its flatness, The Music of the Spheres is, sadly, the latter type of novel. I don't know what would have changed this. Certainly Elizabeth Redfern put an obvious amount of time and effort into her tale of madness, political intrigue, murder and astronomy, all set in a 1790's England similar in its heightened state of alert to America in our own time. And yet...despite what I'm sure were her best efforts, I could not like these characters or care what became of them.I purchased a paperback copy of this book at a dollar store, and when finished, it did not find its way onto my shelf, I donated it to a thrift store. I didn't feel sentimental fondness for it, and I did not enjoy reading it. At the end of the novel, I felt cheated of the time I put into it, and that's a rare experience for a lover of books, like me."
2,Don't go by the cover.,"The cover says ""reminiscient"" of Caleb Carr's ""The Alienist"". For that alone I figured I'd pick this one up. I loved ""Alienist"", and even though I didn't like ""Angel of Darkness"" as much, it was still better than this. There wasn't much that made me ""feel"" for the characters. I wasn't sure if the book was more about wartime intrigue or a serial killer. Maybe I'm just not into spy thrillers and espionage. By the time the plot started to come together at the end, I really didn't care much about whodunit! Caleb, where are you? We need another novel from you!"
1,Ugly. Rambling. Pointless.,"Unfortunately, I felt as though I wasted the hours I spent reading this book. I felt no liking, kinship, sympathy, or anything for any of the characters. The author goes off on pointless tangents, and all of the characters are not only flawed, but outright unpleasant."
1,"Weak plot, lots of gratuitous and explicit violence","I like historical mysteries. Instance of the Fingerpost, Conspiracy of Paper, Quincunx--all really entertaining and interesting books. I thought that's what I was getting here. Instead it's a weak plot with little internal logic or character development. And on top of that, it is filled with explicit, grotesque and gratuitous violence, sometimes bordering on sadism. Look for something else."
1,Spherical Mess,"Being a fan of Caleb Carr's THE ALIENIST and ANGEL OF DARKNESS, I was eagerly awaiting the time to set aside and read Elizabetth Redfern's MUSIC OF THE SPHERES, highly touted by People Magaziine as 'reminiscent' of Carr's novels. A 'lifetime' is what the reader needs to get through this abominable first novel by Redfern. Unlikeable charcters, a dull telling of history, and storylines filled with no surprises, 'spherically' come together for the reader to snore through for what seems like an eternity. Where as I didn't want either of Carr's novels to end, I couldn't wait to close the covers on this inane attempt at a novel. For serious insomniacs only!"
4,Awesome Bondi,Vic Bondi is back. Some really catchy tunes that'll rock your socks off. Excellent lyrics. Great voice. Great sound. A few duds only. Finally another good AT release. And here at amazon you can get it for next to nothing.Highly recommended!
2,Would be great if it worked!,"I ordered my first one, and figured out how to link with my computer; it was easy to use, and seemed to be perfect for my needs. Then I noticed a ""line"" of the diplay was missing, making it difficult to read. I reset it, then called the company. They immediately sent me a new one. A week or two later, the same thing happened to this one. I am not going to spend a lot of time entering info into a product that won't work. Also, the address book does not seem compatible with Excel or any other product, so the only record you will have of it is the one that comes with the software. I would rather have one that I could use for other purposes."
2,dissapointed,"I think that the Rolodex I received was a notch above a plastic piece of junk. It is clumsy to operate and if I had known this is what it consisted of, I would not have ordered it.Allen Baron"
1,Not my favorite!,"I didn't care much for this recording. It doesn't sound real to me. It sounds like a guy standing next to a running shower stall, shaking a large piece of sheet-metal. I liked the Echoes of Nature ""Thunderstorm"" much better. I'd still like to find a good recording with more thunder, though."
1,FLAWLESS WYWBROWS Y EYELASHES,I THINK THIS IS A POOR VIDEO AND I HAVE TROUBLES EVERY TIME WHEN A TRY TO WHACHT THEM BECAUSE THE DISC MAYBE HAS A PROBLEM
4,Waterfall,"The most relaxing cd that I own. If you have ever seen and heard a waterfall in person, you will enjoy owning this. At times, it also sounds like an ocean. The best for relaxtion that I've heard yet."
1,Sounds like static,I was excited to put this in my CD player being that I love waterfalls so much. I was very disappointed when I heard it play. It sounds like the static white noise you hear when a tv station goes off the air.
5,peppermint tea is awesome,peppermint tea is epic. and it's good for you. try it with manuka or bioactive honey. then it's better for you and even more tea-like! without honey is also good.
2,"Good idea, lousy execution","I'm on my second one and they both are defective. Pump constantly leaks where it screws into the gauge end, and the parts are mis-sized so it doesn't tighten. Instructions are poorly written. If you can get the pump to seal it works good."
3,Instructions are reversed ???,"I spend several hours trying to make this product work and finally figured out how the tester worked and that the instructions are defective. They are written backwards, where the booklet says ""bladder"" it should say "" System"" and vice-versa.After I figured that out, the product worked fine -- I think KD should re-write the instructions which will allow the consumer the ability to properly use the product."
4,Cool Tester,This tool kit seems like it will test any cooling system cap imaginable with all of the adapters supplied. The pump and gauge seem to be of good quality metal. The adapters are all plastic. The Instructions for using the adapters are not that well written. The tool uses a universal rubber expanding bladder that you pump up to seal the system for pressure testing. I don't know how long the bladder will last (the kit comes with a spare) - this is the only reason I didn't rate this kit a 5. It has worked excellent so far.
3,Better than series 1,"Series 2 is slightly better than series 1. The actors seem to be enthsiastic in doing their roles, the wardrobe department has supplied costumes tha fit the body shapes of the acting people. On the negative side the programs continue to violate the Hollywood code of conduct by promoting the smoking of cigarettes amongst the public by showing characters smoking. It also has the inverted social structure. People who would be expected to be competent and gracious are not.Two of the four programs have never been dramatized on video format in the 50 years since they were written. These are a must have for Christie video collectors."
4,I guess its a matter of opinion,"Frankly I find McEwan refreshing. Some seem to prefer Hickson as Marple but I frankly find Hickson drab and ill-fitted for the part. She particularly irritates me with her long, all-knowing arrogant-looking pauses and almost seems to play the part like she hates it. Hickson is about as exiting as a wet mop whereas at least McEwan is alive and well. As for one criticism about Tuppence being a tipsy in Prinking of my thumbs, SO WHAT??!! It makes her character real and human. So I give a my prinking of my thumbs up for this version and a 4 star. They can't make the story or script good enough for me to watch Joan Hickson."
2,Marple where Marple doesn't belong.,"It's not Geraldine McEwan's fault, but during her tenure as Miss Marple, the BBC insisted in sticking her in books where Miss Marple didn't belong, and in garbling the plots where she did. Miss Marple does not appear at all in the novel THE SITTAFORD MYSTERY, which does not in the least resemble the TV show of the same name. Which is a shame. THE SITTAFORD MYSTERY (the novel) had one of Dame Agatha's more clever plots--one which the BBC decided to distort beyond recognition. In THE MOVING FINGER they decided to replace a heroic RAF pilot with a suicidal motorcyclist, Heaven knows why, and to replace the incredibly beautiful governess with a rather ordinary-looking one who, in my opinion, would not have inspired the passion required by the book. All in all, I much prefer the late Joan Hickson as Miss Marple."
3,"Sorry, Geraldine doesn't cut it","Fine. Here it is. I cannot accept anyone other than Joan Hickson playing Miss Marple. That's the honest truth. I'm not saying that Geraldine McEwan does not do justice to the role. It's just that the producers and directors have given a slant to this entire series that strays a little too far away from the original. Imagine this... supposing Hercule Poirot's main quirks such as neatness, order, method, his waxed mustache and his reliance ""on the little gray cells"" were to be replaced with a physically active detective who prefers to get physical. This is (in a less extreme form) what has happened to Miss Marple. I don't think Agatha Christie would approve!"
4,McEwan's the best Miss Marple.,"I like Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple better than Joan Hickson or Julia McKenzie. I've enjoyed both other ladies, but McEwan brings a life and sparkle to the role that the others seem to miss. She just seems more inquisitive! The beef I have with this series is the incorporating of the Tommy and Tuppence story ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs"" into a Miss Marple mystery. I probably wouldn't have minded if they just borrowed the story, but to turn Tommy and Tuppence into an insensitive bureaucrat and an insecure lush is sacrilege. Tuppence is an intuitive adventurer and Tommy, her sweet and sensible rock. Leave their characters alone! Let Miss Marple solve the case by herself. The story here bears little resemblance to the original story anyway. Other than that I love these Miss Marple mysteries."
3,Nice part but wrong size....,"Description was misleading and part did not fit my ""standard"" Holley 600 cfm carb. Need better spec on what ""standard"" is and the mating carb inlets."
4,Fascinating historic photographs and facts.,"No sooner had I found one book by this author then a second came along. I was not disappointed with the first and was equally pleased with the second. Every time I opened a page I was drawn to picture after picture of wrecking and stranding to the extent that I simply had to read the caption and then look to see what additional information I could find.Divided into 5 chapters in which the author discusses the shipwrecks of; California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and finally Alaska, we are treated to some of the most exciting tales of shipwreck and tragedy ever to have been recounted in print. A little short of A4 in size, this book provides an excellent format for the scores of historic photographs - often 3, 4 or even 5 to a page reproduced here.Once again, I have to say I think a copy of this book is an essential addition to the bookshelf of any historian or scuba diver with an interest in American shipwrecks.NM"
5,3-Tier Jardini re Planter Review,I had found this in another on-line place but decided to order from Amazon because it was a cheaper price and cheaper shipping. It arrived in a timely manner exactly as described.
3,Tiny Tim - 'Live In Chicago' (Bug House),"There's no doubt about it,Tiny Tim was in a class all by himself.A true novelty performer if there ever was one.I was never even aware of this live CD he had done.I got to see Tiny perform live just months prior to his passing.Even met and hung out with him for a bit.Couldn't believe some of the covers he croons to on this disc until I heard 'em for myself,like Bill Haley&The Comet's ""Rock Around The Clock"",Jerry Lee Lewis's ""Great Balls Of Fire"" and specially AC/DC's ""Highway To Hell""(sounded like he was almost paying a tribute to Elvis).Plus,I always like hearing his sole hit ""Tip Toe Through The Tulips"".You got to be in 'the right mood' to thoroughly enjoy this CD."
3,Tiny captured LIVE,Tiny Tim LIVE is quite an experience. The shocker is that Tiny took his performing quite seriously. He introduces each song and plays it all 98% straight. Highway to Hell is a stand-out. You get a history lesson before Are You Lonesome Tonight?. The crowd is loud and gives any listener who never saw Tiny Tim live a good idea how great a performer he was. Who else could do a song like Mother on stage and pull it off?. As with other Tiny Tim cds you learn something about these great songs. Sound quality is very good. Brief liner notes are interesting.
2,Like crowd noise? This is the CD for YOU!,"Tiny Tim's baritone voice is strong, and his song selection is excellent, but the production value is so poor that the album was ultimately a dissapointment. It sounds like they set up the recorder at the back of the room, so every drunken howl and clanked beer mug comes through loud and clear."
5,Trollwood,"This is my favorite of the Blenders' CDs, probably because it sounds the most like they did back at Trollwood a long time ago. If only you all could have heard the original group do some of the numbers from ""Guys and Dolls."" Glad to see the group is doing well."
2,not so much,"Hey, don't get me wrong. I like the Blenders, but this cd left me wanting more. Guess I got jaded listing to their xmas classics and then I hear this stuff...yech. I think that they sound much better singing slower music than the faster stuff; maybe it's me. You decide."
5,Teriific pictures in a fun camera,"I bought this for my 14 year old daughter for her birthday. She had been asking for a camera for a while, and when I saw this in the store I could not resist it. She takes this camera everywhere. It fits in her very small hand bag and takes great pictures. The lack of a zoom is the only drawback. We recently took a vacation in Florida, and although I had packed my larger Sony Mavica, this is the camera we took everywhere, and we got some really wonderful pictures with it. I recommend this camera, if you want a handy, small camera, that produces quality pictures."
5,Anyone know where to get a fresh vinyl copy of the soundtrack?,"I have a pretty worn copy of the Deutsche Grammophon 1977 from PolydorIntl GmbH (vinyl, of course)....did they ever release it on CD?Is a fresh copy on vinyl out of the question?"
3,Spectacular Animations!,"The music choices and the animations were wonderful. At times silly, at times thoughtful, at times simple and beautiful. I didn't enjoy the live actions pieces though and they took up about half of the film.Another reviewer described them as mean, that is the perfect way to describe them. The ""story"" of these pieces is that the director and conducter have tormented and forced a group of elderly women to play the pieces (at one point beating an old woman - off screen) and tortured (ie chained up in a cellar and starved) the animator. Perhaps there was something funny about torture when this film came out that I am missing now. I did really love the animations and music though. If you skip over the live action parts, this could be a really great film."
3,Not fully realized.,"Without a doubt ""Allegro Non Troppo""is fun, but it is not great. It is addictive. Thus, the cult that has grown up around it, and kept the movie in print for nearly two decades. The animated vignettes and the music are very well done (especially the wry take on evolution set to ""Bollero,"" and the Debussy piece). However, thesatire is often heavy-handed, obvious, and out of sync with the more graceful animated sections. It's all moot, however. You wouldn't be hunting for this movie, or reading these reviews if you hadn't already seen it. Supposedly, there are recently released, remastered editions of this movie. Beware, the newer releases are said to be dubgbed in English. The sound (if it really has been remastered) might be better, but it's never ""the same movie"" when it's been dubbed. A matter of taste, I guess."
5,True Landmark Work of Art,"I first saw ""Allegro non Troppo"" on the big screen, and it simply blew me away. Where Disney's ""Fantasia"" is beautiful but naturalistic, AnT is wild, irreverent, heartbreaking, nightmarish, hilarious, and completely original.The idea of putting pictures to classical music isn't unique (perhaps not since ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" put music to pictures), but Bozzetto really stretches the idea.I'm not going to try to describe each segment, because I believe that each is an element of a complete experience, and simply must be seen. But I will concede that the live-action sequences grow stale and clumsy. In the end, they detract from the overall movie, sort of like putting the Mona Lisa in a frame from Dollar Tree.In these days of computer-generated animation that produces impressive but lifeless images, it's refreshing to look back on the real potential of animation.I guarantee you, you'll never see a stray cat the same way again."
3,"Good, but there are some problems","The animations of Tiger swinging and putting are very good, as are easy controls and varying of courses. However, be aware that when aiming your shot down a fairway, you have to ""drag"" the course along with your stylus. when i got really into the game, i realised that i was making scratches across my visor's screen. Just be careful..."
5,Tiger Woods Golf is great fun,"The graphics on this game are quite incredible considering that it runs off of a handheld device not created with games in mind. That said, this is a great game if you have time to kill. The ability to choose from 3 types of play and 3 courses adds to the re-playability factor. This game is great, addictive fun for the Handspring."
2,"Game is OK, but boring","The graphics look good and game-play is smooth, but things quickly get repetitive. I enjoyed my first few rounds, but got bored with it after that with a feeling of 'been there, done that.' Also, the documentation is terrible, meaning that some shot features (such as spin) are apparently in the game but I have no idea how to access them."
3,How much do we really need to know?,"I'm not a scholar of history, but have always been interested in the man that wrote the Meditations. I thought an in-depth analysis would be the trick for getting to know this Stoic Emperor better. In Birley's book, however, I experienced information overload.We learn a great deal about the Emperor's tutors and family. But the reader, at least this reader, is given so much detail, that it is difficult to organize the data in a meaningful way. I could not distinguish the significant from the merely interesting.If you already know quite a bit about Marcus Aurelius and want to learn more, by all means buy this book.If, on the other hand, you want an inroduction to his life, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
3,"Good, scholarly but not a ""great read""","I enjoyed Birley's biography of Marcus Aureliusm, because I was interested in the man.Even so, it is written as an academic treatment limiting the story to the primary sources, with constant quotes from them. This is certainly an accurate manner to depict biographical information, but not as compelling as say Robin Fox's treatment of Alexander the Great which is equally well-research and annotated but is also a great ""read."""
2,runs small,"I measured my head to ensure that I would get a ""perfect"" fit - unfortunately I ended up with a hat that is far too small for me. Hopefully with some work I'll be able to stretch it enough to be wearable . . ."
5,"Little Platter, But","These little platters would be practical for small servings, but I purchased mine as a under plate for the sauce boat. They work perfectly for my purposes. Besides they are cute."
4,Much smaller than expected,"I have to admit that when I saw the word 'platter' I did not look at the actual size of the platter. When I got this, I was shocked to see how small it really is. So if; like me you are looking for a platter for a main dish to set in the middle of the table - do not choose this one. It is really small... but the good news is that it is very useful for other (smaller) items that you do not want to put in a big round plate. So it is a very useful platter. I bought two and I have found that I have used them often. More so than I would have expected. To be honest - If I had seen the size before I bought them, I would not have purchased them - but now I am glad I did...."
1,Poor packaging results in broken dishes,"I ordered Fiesta dishes, and they arrived broken in many pieces. The dishes were wrapped individually in bubble wrap, and stacked on top of each other in a box. There was no packaging material on the bottom of the box, on the sides or inbetween the dishes. While shopping I read a review warning me Amazon poorly packaged dishes resulting in broken broken dishes. Unfortunately, I did not heed the warning.Very disappointed that Amazon packaged the dishes so poorly, what a waste. I did not reorder, I will purchase the dishes elsewhere. I love Fiesta ware, however would not suggest purchasing from Amazon."
4,I can't Review,This was given as part of a wedding gift set. I have not heard pro nor con from the receiving couple.
2,So-so,"Though we like the ""oval"" concept for these dishes, almost each dish has a default. The default is in the plate, when the glaze is burned on the ceramic. I sent one plate back, because it was so bad, and the one I got in it's place is even worse! I think that the production of these plates has to have a better ""QAULITY REVIEW"" before they are placed as available for sale to the public. I will keep what I have, but I will not be buying any more of these plates."
4,Fun Platters for Hosting,"The fiesta line is really fun. I love the colors. They are perfect for hosting Sunday football. I ordered 3 in 3 different sizes and colors. The only minor negative is the size of the platters. This particular platter is SUPER SMALL. Not much bigger than your typical dessert plate. However, all of the serving platters were smaller than expected, but they still do the job just fine."
5,Smaller than I realized,"I had ordered 2 of these to use as small serving platters, but did not realize how small they really are. It will still work for serving some things, like sausages, hot dogs, crackers, fudge or other desserts, etc. But I think its main use will be to use as an eating dish. It is the perfect size and shape for omelettes, fajitas, burritos, nachos, sausages, etc. I love this platter--it has high sides on it and it is a fun dish to use for eating!"
4,Perfect Fit,I love the color I got and it fit perfectly. Nice texture to it and easy to wash. Great product. Looses a star for the price though.
5,Great!,"Excellent songwriting, production values, and musicianship. I have to say that the drumming really stands out. Yoshi Nakamoto just bangs the drum like no other. Even though his work has been consistent throughout his career (Drunk With Buddah, Nuckle Brothers, Scenic Vermont, Poastal), this has been his biggest achievement. Yoshi forever."
1,boring,"The CD starts off really good and then all of a sudden you keep hearing the same creek sound, with no difference in the sound at all.I was looking for a creek with different sounds not the same one over and over. If all you want is the same sound than this is for you,if not then you should look for a different CD."
5,LOVE IT!,"I already have ONE, and play it all night. I have 2 CD players going,so put frogs or crickets etc. on the other machine: that way, when one ""recircles"" there is no annoying ""gap"" in the ambient sound. Now I can play the SAME thing endlessly, with no sudden noises (as happens with ""natural"" recordings).Might get about 3 more CD players and add in other sounds..pity they cannot yet play different cd's SIMULTANEOUSLY!"
3,NOT MY FAVORITE,"Not my favorite Sondheim show, but it's still worth a listen. However, if you for some crazy reason don't have Assassins yet get that instead."
2,Debbie,In the free Kindle version Dolly is substituted for Debbie (the cook) for 95 % of the book. I've never seen that in a paper copy before. It's not like it a new or self-published story.
3,Disappointed with the missing parts of the story,"I read Eight Cousins when I was about 10, and was really excited to see this available for my Kindle. Imagine my unhappiness when I found parts of the book have been left out of the Kindle version. Perhaps because it is a free book? I didn't notice the description saying it was abridged but maybe I missed that part of it.There are words left out, entire paragraphs left out, punctuation either missing or incorrect...I was very disappointed.The basic story is there, but the gaps leave me feeling disjointed while reading."
2,Eight Reasons NOT to Read Eight Cousins...,"Okay, I'm being a little harsh because anyone who's read Little Women knows that Louisa May Alcott is capable of writing spellbinding novels. However, Eight Cousins falls short of her writing abilities. Instead of finding the charming tale many people claim it to be, I found a dreadfully boring story about a young girl being raised by her uncle amongst eight male cousins. The story drags and the character development is, at best, weak. I'd recommend skipping Eight Cousins altogether and reading Little Women, if you haven't already."
3,Could be a Disney movie,A Rosy girl is guided toward womanhood. The book deliversold fashioned wholesomeness and family values in 19th century culturewith literary attributed footnotes. Her work here delineates howwomen could grow up healthy in a male dominated Victorian era.The resulting novel is a little artificially sweet by today's standards.Style and motivation are good but it fails to be very important for modern young girls.
4,Miss these,"I miss these old quaint reads! Glad I could find them for my new toy! Great read, made me tear up!"
2,Fluff,"If you're interested in reading a story that contains irony or an antagonist, keep looking. If, however, you long to be drowned in blithe mirthiness and sunshine then this is for you."
4,Classic Alcott,"Although a bit short, if you have read every other LMA book like I have it was nice to visit this one as well."
4,Eight Cousins review,"alcott as outdone herself--thought the language was quite difficult at times, and though many can imagine ourselves in rose campbells situations, these tales are anything but predictable."
2,technical problems,"The music is 4 or 5 star; if you like Marty Robbins, you'll like the CD. This disc will not, however, play on a computer and cannot be ripped. I received one replacement from the seller and another from Bear Family, and all three had the same problem. Since this hasn't been an issue with my other 3,000 or 4,000 CDs that I've ripped, I assume the problem is not the CD drive in my computer (a fairly new HP CD/DVD burner). The CD does, however, play fine in my regular Sony audio CD player."
4,Definitely worth buying. It was my textbook for a class!,"What can you say about a fiction anthology that a teacher actually used for a college class? Well, for one thing, you can say that it is probably one of the best representations of contemporary fiction that you can buy at a reasonable price.There are so many great authors on here, that I don't know where to begin. The editors basically took every great short fiction author, and popped one of their best short stories into this anthology. I've read the whole book cover to cover a couple of times, and it still manages to inspire.The editors did a good job of selecting stories that represent a broad range of literary styles. Carver's minimalism is represented here, as well as stories from a countless number of his contemporaries. A well rounded collection over all. I think it still might be a little pricey for its size, but it may be well worth it for the present content, regardles."
4,Very good and interesting,Contray to what one review said this book is not dull and boring but autual fun and interesting. I recomened this book to people.
1,"Only because ""no stars"" was not an option!","I would advise staying away from these Artists. I had also purchased ""Rainstorms"" when I bought this Title. What a mistake! It sounds more like 'white noise' then a Walk at the Beach. In the beginning all you hear are the ""shells in the undertow"" only problem is you don't hear a wave. Good luck hunting, but avoid this Title and Artist."
1,Same Ol' Story,"This is like the same story as Casting the First Stone, the only difference being that the wife's name has changed...The only thing that gave some uniqueness to the story is the fact that this time the daughter is older and she has a story but that's it. I would recommend Casting the First Stone but not Too Much of a Good Thing..."
5,I loved it,I loved reading about Pastor Black! Ms Roby is becoming one of my favorite authors. I really didnt want this one to end. Very entertaining read!
5,Mouth Hung Open Shock,"A cheating man will get paid back. A cheating man who's a pastor will get paid back twice. Pastor Curtis Black was forgiven and sinned again. Will he ever learn. He's a master of deception, handsome and a smooth talker. He draws women and preys on them. His actions crush the spirit of the women he lures. Pastor Curtis Black is ruthless but vengenance...Two Much of a Good Thing is a great book! From page one you're drawn into Pastor Black's world.How well do you know your preacher?"
3,"Not bad, but not great","I can't recall a time that I loathed a main character as much as I did Curtis Black! He was infuriating and I found myself irate throughout most of the book. I'm sad to say that I know a great deal of men like him and women like the ones portrayed in this book. It did keep my interest and I was glad that I gave this author a chance as this was my first novel by her. The reason I deducted stars, however, was because some parts were repetitive and a few instances seemed far-fetched to me. Charlotte was the one character that I didn't really understand. I'm sure I'll find out soon enough since I also bought the follow up to this book. They were in a bargain bin for three dollars so I took a chance. The second one is starting to get on my nerves so I think I'll take a break from Curtis Black for now. I'd be interested to read one of her other series, though."
3,I wanted HIS butt to get blown away,"I was married to a character like Curtis, he was a snake and just as sneaky. I would hate to think that there could be a pastor out there that was really this much of a player. If God really did call a man to preach I'm sure that he would make sure his heart was in the right place, and that wouldn't be in his pants...Well written but didn't leave me with a good feeling."
2,Come On Yall,"People, people, people! Yall know that this book is entirely OVERRATED! This was not a good book. It's not even an average book. I'd say that it is rather a disappointing book. I am not impressed with Ms. Roby's writing. She's an average writer -- nothing to get all hyped about. In the past, she tells the same old boring stories that have been told over and over again. But to her credit, she did bring out a new fad in ""teen phone sex."" It would be nice to hear some new stories from fresh voices. Naturally, Terri Mc is the girl. By the way, where's she been hiding? Isn't it about time we hear from her again? Also, newcomer R.M. Johnson is a delightfully fresh new voice."
2,TOO MUCH OF THE SAME THING,"Let me preface this to say that I normally love Ms. Roby's book...shes definately one of my favorite authors. Like many of my favorite authors,I sense urgency in writing books. It comes through the pages.TMOAGT is the same as Casting the First Stone.Same characters, same messed up choices, same outcomeat the same point in time. If you read one you have read the other.That to me, dosn't show any creativity on Ms. Roby's part,but then again it could be the publishing company and theeditor responsible for this duplicity.As a consumer and avid book reader I thought Ideserved more in a sequal to a great book and greater author."
1,Too Much Is Not Enough,"Very seldom are sequels up to the same level as the first one and I usually try and keep in mind that the story may go into a new direction. Sequels are stories that are somewhat new or new to the reader because it is the telling of events unknown heretofore. Considering all that, this book still didn't work.The story was painfully formulaic, predictable, and lacked realism. The characters had no depth, and the dialogue was torturous. One star is too much to give this book."
3,A note on God's Grace,"God only forgives those who REPENT: Repentance requires sorrow for the sins committed and the resolution to at least try to not commit the same sins again. The mere mouthing of the words ""God forgive me"" don't work as a magic talisman to purchase entry into heaven. For God knows a man's heart..."
3,"It's no ""First Stone"", but it was aiight","Ms Roby has a gift of story telling. The Curtis saga was once again engaging. ""Oh what a tangled web we weave..."" It was cool to meet up with all the characters five years later. And unfortunately, Ms Roby's account is probably closer to truth than fiction for alot of our modern day pastors. However I agree with those reviewers who said book was predictable. Unlike in ""First Stone"", the end seemed like it was a manipulated effort to tie up the different plots. I appaud the book, but I think I've gotten enough of the Blacks this time."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!!,If there was a way to vote for 10 stars this book would definitely get it. I stumbled upon Ms. Roby's writing through my book club and haven't been able to stop reading her since. Her writing is so filled with depth of each and every character you feel like you know them personally! This is one of the best books I've read so far this year. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone that likes a good read. Make sure you pick up Casting the First Stone to really get the background of Rev. Black -- another EXCELLENT book!
4,Curtis is just sickening.,"WHEN WILL HE LEARN?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you enjoyed ""Casting The First Stone"", then you will enjoy this book too. This book will make you shake your head. If you are reading reviews and wondering if this book is worth buying, I would recommend purchasing this for you library. I believe there will be another sequel."
4,"Curtis, Curtis, Curtis",Great book. I enjoyed reading about Curtis and his drama. The fact that he's the preacher of the church and acts like this is just a shame and it definitely makes you think. Great writing. I am interesting in reading more from Kimberla.
5,"Wonderful, Just Simply Wonderful","This book is a joy to read. Kim Lawson Roby has done it again. If you haven't read ""Casting the First Stone"" then you should. You will not know what you are missing until you have read ""Casting"". This book is truly a page turner."
4,a good book,i thought this was a very good book if you read casting the first stone you're going to love this book
4,Joyful Sadness,Kimberla is an AWESOME writer and I enjoy all of her books. She definitely keeps it interesting. The only reason this book was not given 5 stars is because I think it's sad that we are excited about a book that portrays Christians this way. To each his own I guess.
5,Possibly the best cookbook of the many I own,"When I first saw this book in a store, I thought it was a grill cookbook. I read the back, saw that it was devoted to hot n' spicy cooking, and bought it on a whim. I found it to be perhaps the best cookbook I own. I usually feel that a meal isn't complete without meat, but these recipes are so flavorful and interesting that I don't miss it. The recipes range from simple to exotic and all are, in my experience, exceptional. I have recommended this book to many friends, most of whom have bought more copies to give to friends. I wholeheartedly recommend Kiss of the Devil Hot Cocoa, Blueberry Pancakes from Hell, Black Bean Burritos, and Hot Potato Corn Chowder. Trust me, they're all unique and exceptional. Thanks, Mr. Hufnagle, for sharing these recipes! Hope for a follow-up soon! ALLRIGHT!!!"
5,Fires Up the veggie diet for the manly biker in all of us!,"Met Biker Billy at his in-person demo at Mancuso's Harley-Davidson in Houston; ate his samples; and have to have the book! If this is your first venture into the world of peppers, please make the cooling dip first! The recipes contained are easy, fun and delicious. An entertaining book to heat up the kitchen by. Are you a manly enough biker, or just a wanna-be?"
4,The Biryani recipe alone is worth the cost of the book.,"I wasn't raised on Tex-Mex or Indian or any other kind of spicy cuisine, so the idea of a cookbook dedicated to spicy hot foods would not have lured me. The book belonged to an old boyfriend and I was desperate for something new - and vegetarian. Don't let the long list of ingredients intimidate you but do allow ample time the first time you do this recipe for a traditional Indian rice dish. Use a cast iron Dutch oven for best results. Trust the recipe and go. The result is a complex layering of flavors you discover and re-discover with every bite. Once you get the basics, feel free to vary with different meats and vegetable combinations. Since then I've discovered several other gems between the two covers. You will too."
5,Heading to the Air France terminal,"What a great film. Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more the second time. Meryl Streep was quite a suprise and the whole film makes me yearn for a more civilized time. If you love art, food and the delightful great chefs as I have never seen them before, this is for you."
3,Cooking Show,"While this makes for an interesting cooking how-to, I was hoping for a bit more historical fact and discussion/display of Monet's artistic masterpieces or actual photos of his gardens at Giverny."
5,Very pleased,I had heard great reviews about Monet's Palate and decided to purchase it for my husband for Valentines Day - great hit and the work that Aileen Boardman put into the film was beautifully accomplished.
3,sizing,"Being a huge Dolphins' fan, I saw this shirt and I loved it. I ordered it right away. I was surprised when I got it though. I usually wear a size 4 or size 6 so I ordered a large in this t-shirt, thinking it would be just fine. I certainly understand that the style of the shirt is meant to be fitting, that is one of the reasons I ordered it. This shirt ran very, very small. It was so small that the bottom of the shirt barely went down over my belly button. I like a slim-fitting shirt but this particular one just seemed especially small for a size large!!"
4,"excellent single, but better with Burning Empires","The second single from the new VNV Nation album ""Empires,"" ""standing"" is a triumphant song. Guardedly optimistic, especially for VNV, but still dark and moody. Very beautiful. This single has the original, as well as two new mixes of ""standing"" (""still"" and ""motion"") and a new instrumental (""radius ^2""). ""Still"" is more stripped down than the original, with less percussion and stronger vocals. ""Motion"" is a masterpiece- sped up and made even more intense than the original. ""Radius ^2"" seems like a straightforward dance track, but one that has that uniquely VNV touch. Shake yer money maker to this one.Overall an excellent single. however, it does not earn 5 stars when placed next to the amazing double CD ""Burning Empires"" set, which includes ""Standing"" and a remix disk from ""Empires."" That set is by far worth the extra money."
4,Great Song but This Isn;'t What You Were Looking for...,"This song is a masterpiece but this domestic single is not the one that created all of the buzz. The import 2-disc version of this single is called ""Burning Empires"" and it is the painfully rare diamond in the entire scene. With B-sides so good that they get more club-play than any other songs and receive better live reactions. Too bad though, the 'BE' double EP sells for about $150 on E-Bay. Luckily we all downloaded all of the songs before the recording industry started throwing kids in jail. Oh, you didn't get yours? Uh, Sorry...If you don't have BE then maybe you should get this for the cool remixes. I'll bet you'll be happy enough with the album version though. And good lord, don't buy this single w/o buying the entire album."
4,Even adults like it,This is a fun movie! There is a five minute montage set to a GooGoo Dolls song that you'll want to mute.
4,"For boy's adventure, this is one of Disney's animated best","Perhaps the failure to include a standard-issue spunky, perky, sassy ""girl-power"" counterpart to Jim ultimately doomed this movie . . . I don't know. The NC Wyeth-inspired art direction and superior source material should have made TREASURE PLANET a huge success for Disney--instead it was virtually disowned by the company and ignored by audiences. Judging by the inflated price of this DVD, Disney is still trying to recover losses. But even at the higher price, this one is worth it, especially if you have boys (or tomboys). Read Stevenson's TREASURE ISLAND to them first (or show them Disney's fine live-action adaptation starring Robert Newton) and then treat them to this clever sci-fi spin on the classic tale."
4,Better Than Expected.,"I approached this movie with low expectations, having read the generally poor reviews, and noting the weak performance at the box officer, but I must admit that I was plesantly surprised by this movie. The animation is very good, although I wish Disney would move on to Pixar and Dreamworks computer animation, the voice talent is superb, and the story is fun. I recommend Treasure Planet to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER (from a 15 yr old's point of view),"BEST. MOVIE. EVER. PERIOD!!! Funniest, greatest part of movie? One word... MORPH<3 SPIDER PSYCHO! SPIDER PSYCHO! I don't know WHAT everyone is talking about... it lacked NOTHING. I laughed, I cried, I gasped, and it's one of those movies I could watch over, and over, and over, and over, and yea you get the point :)I <3 Treasure Planet ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
4,terrific scifi animated adaptation of RL Stevenson's classic,"This is an animated science fiction story based on Robert Louis Stevension's Treasure Island. The script is very good though, as usual with Disney, not as enlightened as one would wish or hope. The animation and design are breathtaking, the characters are fun and the songs are minimally intrusive. All-in-all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and look forward to re-reading the book so I can see how it compares.Disney's forte continues to be their state-of-the-art dvd extras, and this disc is no exception. There are trailers and featurettes galore, games, music videos, deleted scenes, an alternate ending and a commentary track with the producer and two directors. Spoken language options are English, French or Spanish, and English captions are available."
5,MIDWEST BOOK REVEIW - DELIGHTFUL!,"I really enjoyed this movie and watched it 3 times with eachone of my grandchildren. The characters, Jim Hawkins, John Silver, Captain Amelia, Doppler, well all of them, were top notch in my eyes, as were all the extra aliens mulling about.Wonderful! I feel the movie stayed quite close to the originalstoryline, it was packed full of action, adventure and a sprinkleof humor here and there which only spiced up the experience ofwatching the movie.I believe my favorite was the space whales, I actually gaspedwhen I saw them! Animation, computer effects, I feel were top ofthe line. I recommend this movie, great family entertainment!"
4,Great Characters,"I am a cartoon collector and a big Disney fan, but I had not seen this movie until last week when I bought a used copy of the DVD. It was a good purchase. Great Disney movie. Not much singing (maybe 2 songs) for those of you who are not into Disney musicals. Very fun, great animation (both regular and digital), good action, great comedy, and lots of heart. The most colorful Disney characters since Alice in Wonderland and almost as funny as The Emperor's New Groove."
5,A Movie That Makes You Dream,"Even if it isn't exactly after the rules of the book, nor gravity, I greatly appreciated this animation movie. The characters were alive and the relationship between old pirate Long John Silver and young lad Jim Hawkins showed what true friendship looks like and that people can change for the better of ways. The soundtrack is also one of the best, the music and the lyrics make you fly off and enter the wonderful world that Disney created to let people dream."
2,There are better films to watch,"I bought this DVD mostly based on the other recommendations. This is not a good film. It isn't horrible, and it shares the universal appeal that all animation has for children, but there are better things to do with your time.The animation is good, but not great. A game like Final Fantasy displays more imagination when fusing sailing ships and space travel. You certainly see why hand-drawn animation is being replaced by computer animation.The plot is abysmally shallow. The lead character was obviously designed by a committee, hoping to create someone with which today's teenagers could identify. Most of the sidekicks were even more bland than the lead (was there any question how Morph would impact the story? Did Martin Short's robot character contribute *anything*?).I'm sure Disney consulted many focus groups to patch together this script. I wish they had taken a chance with a more inspiring storyline."
3,"Fun movie for kids, not too painful for adults","This movie is a futuristic adaptation of ""Treasure Island"", complete with extreme skateboarding/snowboarding. The various space creatures that make up the crew of the ship are interesting and just scary enough to keep the attention of small children.This is definitely not in the same league as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Snow White"", but it is still a fun movie. Children under 10 will enjoy it. For adults, it's not that bad. I didn't mind watching it, but it's not something I would pick for myself.There is a lot of action and strange charatcters, and everything works out fine in the end for most of the ""good guys"". There are some people who die, but actual death occurs off camera, so as not to be too upsetting for the children.This is a solid 3 star movie, but is probably a 4+ star film for small children."
3,Question....,Does anyone here think this has a bit of a steampunk theme or feeling to it?Just wondering....
3,Anybody notice the similarity between Treasure Planet and Rogue Galaxy?,"I have searched through out the internet and I can't find a single form discussing about similarities between Treasure Planet and a Playstation 2 game called Rogue Galaxy. They are extremely similar with 1700s ship design that can travel through space in search of a planet with loads of treasures. For Rogue Galaxy, it's about searching the Planet of Eden where it has the most advance technology and eternal life. The Disney's version is just a buch of jewlery and gold."
4,"Quite colorful, but hardly child-friendly, more for grownups","Treasure Planet is supposedly based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. The animated movie was more specifically similar to Terry Brooks' trilogy about the Voyage of the Jerle Shannara. The special effects bring this book to life, as does the important ""lost"" treasure which, when found, proved useless because it is antiquated. In Brooks' story, the forbidden treasure was all the words in the language changed into a computer system which became outdated and was totally lost as all the books had been destroyed.The creatures are reminiscent of those seen in the bar of the first Star Wars movie. The action is what you'd expect if a movie were made of the Brooks' trilogy, the flights and fighting scenes with dangerous pitfalls.Not much of Stevenson's book written so long ago is in this modern sci-fi parody. Be sure to observe the four babies at the end: the future of our world?"
2,o.k.,i thought movie was o.k. it wasn't that great. sure i did like the animation but disney is losing their touch. it just didnt have much of a plot it just dragged on and on. it never touched me.disney should look out cause things like shrek and spirited away are rolling in the cash. but if you are a huge disney fan go ahead buy it but its not a huge loss if you dont id go for studio ghibli related items
4,Beautiful Animation & Surprisingly Touching Characters,"I am not a Treasure Island fan, but I loved this movie. Jim and the Cyborg have an awesome rapport -- which is saying something for an animation, and Morph is great comic relief. The soundtrack is great, and the animation is beautiful.It loses a star for the robot on Treasure Planet. That was an utter mistake by the scriptwriters. If you can ignore his existence, this goes back up to being a 5."
4,Beautiful animation and wonderful story. Me and my 5 year old loved it!,"My son subsequently requested ""The Christmas Ship"" story -- which has a similar nautical theme. We've watched this film more than once in my house!"
5,Great,Remember this movie from 2002 even though i was 42 at the time enjoyed then and now.Good visiual effects.
4,"Good movie that puts ""Atlantis"" to shame...","This was a very underrated animated gem of last year which didn't get the box office attention it deserved. All the elements of classic Disney are here, and the plot works well in context. The only place where it falls short is a robotic character named B.E.N., who can be classified as a poor man's Jar-Jar Binks. A definite must for a DVD collector, mainly for the excellent sound and visuals."
5,Treasure Planet: Not your ordinary sci-fi,"I went to the theaters to watch what I thought was going to be okay, but not as good as, say, The Lion King. Although it doesn't have the classic Disney feel, I would say Treasure Planet is my favorite movie ever.Treasure Planet, which I own on DVD, is a movie many people think of as sci-fi, at least those who haven't watched it. If they had, they would see this is no cheesy alien-attack video. Instead they would see a beautiful retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson's masterpiece. This movie captured my heart.Partially computer-generated, partially animated, Treasure Planet blew me away. Still true to the storyline of Treasure Island, it added humor and bits of story to the original tale, as well as blasting it off into space.All in all, a very clever movie. I recommend you buy this and watch it as soon as possible. Hope to see you at the Montressor Spaceport!"
1,SEE TREASURE ISLAND INSTEAD,"I had high hopes for TREASURE PLANET. I knew the $140 million animated epic bombed on its theatrical release($38 million gross) but I figured it was probably just bad advertising and promotion. and the DVD would reveal itself as a gem. I was wrong.This is a bizarro adaptation of Stevenson's Treasure Island. It mixes futuristic sci-fi elements with 18th century props. The idea of adapting Treasure Island into a set-in-the-future race to a Treasure Planet is a good one, but co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker's ill-conceived execution of this concept derails early on. These guys missed the boat by light years by trying to force a pointless retro future look and numerous, tired Disney formulas into their vanity production. Admittedly, the images are often stunning, but that alone does not a picture make. ..."
1,Truely A Treasure,"Of Trash. Michael Eisner is a money crazy freak. Disney is not how it used to be, and this movie shows it. The classic musicals are no more. This movie is a take on of Treasure Island, so why couldn't they just make it treasure island? They have to make everything so ""Teen"", because it is not about the kids anymore, or even the teens, just the money.PS: Walt Disney would roll around in his grave if he see's his name on trash like this movie, and the disney channel stuff, and the expensive tickets to get into the park he made for ALL kids to enjoy."
2,Awful,"Some may call it a cult classic, I just call it awful. I saw this movie in Chicago with my wife when it came out and nearly walked out before it was over; had it not been a slow night with bad weather I probably would have. My advice, don't let the Disney name draw you in because this movie isn't worth watching for free on cable."
4,"Not Disney's best, but not their worst","Treasure Planet was a a movie I took with a grain of salt. It's not one of Disney's better known features, so I didn't expect much. At first, I thought the movie was going to live up to that idea, but once you get past its first half hour of awkward character introductions, it proves to be a fine entry to the Disney library. Beautiful animation and strong story prove to be one of Disney's better final attempts at classic animation."
4,Surpisingly good; among Disney's best,"Well, from the look of the trailers I have to say this film looked like it would really stink. Then I decided to rent it and I must say, it's among Disney's best films. From the people who brought you ALADDIN, TREASURE PLANET (fairly well adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson's classic ""Treasure Island"") is an immensely entertaining film set in a futuristic space-based world, where Jim Hawkins teams up with a group of the oddest creatures ever - including cyborg Long John Silver - to find a lost treasure hidden somewhere on an undiscovered planet. Good voice acting, a very nice soundtrack and some extremely cool animation add to the fun; I must say it's very, very good, surprisingly good compared to the bad trailers. Overall, I highly recommend that you take a journey to the TREASURE PLANET as quick as you can!"
2,Treasure Planet,"I must admit that I bought into Disney's hype machine on Treasure Planet, and I wish I hadn't. Treasure Planet is a pathetic movie. Nothing is orginal at all, there's no character development. It's like they took a bunch of ideas from previous kids movies and threw them into this mess. The animation, which was one of the big reasons I wanted to see it, was nothing special at all. I wouldn't waste anytime watching Treasure Planet. Lastly, Treasure Planet didn't fail because of production fiascos, the reason it failed is that it's just not very good."
1,Horrible movie for kids,this movie looks like such fun on the previews but its horrible. It is nothing but monsters and bad habits and bad people. Anyone with morals would not show this to a child. Get the movie monsters inc. Instead
2,not widescreen,"Was going to purchase this release but it's in TV format. 1:66:1. So I decided to get the newer, blue ray release which is widescreen/ flat format."
4,Better than expected,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie, as much of what I had heard about it was negative. It turns out to be an good movie and the alternate universe this is set in is interesting. It was a fun movie to watch with my wife."
5,A different kind of kids movie,"I'm 18 and I really enjoyed this movie. OMG it doesn't have princesses or talking animals in it! *rolls eyes* (lol I'm a sucker for the Lion King)This is a story about a kid who was abandoned by his dad and he just seems lost on the point of life and turns into a bit of a rebel but he grows up through the movie by taking responsibility in what he does with a new father figure who isn't perfect because no one is. This movie also has 3D mixed in with it's 2D animation which I find neat(reminds me of Anastasia). If you get it, I hope you enjoy it as much as me."
5,Action & Adventure in Disney's Hidden Gem,"Treasure Planet is an unknown gem to many people I have spoken to. It is not your typical Disney fairy tale nor is it a whimsical child's movie, even though it's perfectly suited for children. It's the fusion of the classic Treasure Island with a futuristic space and steampunk setting. There's plenty of action and adventure along with a few heartfelt Disney moments. This movie is among my all time favorite animated features. Definitely a must see."
3,Convince your soldiers to pull the trigger,"Marshall addresses the issue of fire head-on in this book. Quite simply, Marshall says that infantry can be much more effective by convincing the troops to fire their weapons. An astonishingly high percentage of infantrymen never fire their weapons while under fire themselves. Marshall is an astute follower of military doctrine, and this book should not be missed. (For those who have read James Webb's ""Fields of Fire,"" this book is prominently mentioned."
3,"Great machine, but hard to repair","Probably not a problem if you buy with Amazon and have a warranty, but we used this machine for just a year and the water gasket on the side started leaking water. Because we now live in Japan, it was a huge hassle to find out how to repair it- looks like it can only be repaired in Italy, Europe or the US so we are out of luck. Besides it breaking and having repair issues, it is a great machine that makes wonderful, frothy espresso. The steamer/foamer on the side is also a great function and I became a huge fan of lattes while my hubby was a diehard espresso junky while we had it and couldn't drink ""normal"" coffee at restaurants anymore, it truly spoiled us."
5,I saw this group at Elmira College,"I saw this group twice,at Elmira College (Elmira, NY). I heard most of these songs in concert. The have a great stage show and a terrific sense of humor that comes accross on some of these tracks. The quality of this group is A+. you won't regret adding this to your collection."
3,so so,"This one is ok, but nothing to write home about. My first experience with the Blenders is when then sing old classic christmas songs, I really like those, but this one had a mix of fast & slow and familiar tunes and not so familiar. I just couldn't get into it. But maybe you can."
3,Original Eyemodule only OK,"The original Eyemodule works very smoothly, once you download the necessary software from the website for your Visor. Unfortunately the resolution, even at maximum resolution of 320x240 pixels is disappointing and hardly useful except for including in email. If you paid full list price for this item, my condolences. The module is selling at a discount because Eyemodule2 has just been released. It has much more resolution -- and should be more usable. It will cost about ..., which will make you wonder whether you shouldn't just buy a nice standalone digital camera with more resolution. It is very convenient to have in your pocket or briefcase and should allow you to not miss those treasured ""Kodak"" moments in your life, or atleast not have to copy all the notes from a white board at your next meeting."
5,Great for remembering faces,"I got this camera with not too many expecations, after all, it is a lot smaller than any other camera I have ever used. It's practically invisible!Then I downloaded the new eyecontact software available at their web site ... and it makes this module really useful! It allows me to add pictures to my address book!It takes reasonable images in bright light (outside) or in well lit rooms.I am pretty happy with it and as long as you don't compare it to a [more expensive] digital camera, it does pretty well."
2,Expensive Toy,"I bought the eyemodule thinking I would have photos decent enough to e-mail and/or print out with minor touch-up in Photoshop. Not the case. The 320x240 color resolution just doesn't give you sufficient material to work with and the ""camera"" is very sensitive to light (needs a lot). I returned the eyemodule after a few days of experimenting with it hoping that the design team will improve the resolution to at least 640x480 and include on-board memory so that the internal memory of the Visor isn't such a limiting factor."
3,Very slow focusing...,"I've tried this for a couple of weeks and returned it. The focusing took far too long - trying to get shots of anything with a little motion was very difficult (small children, etc) - pictures ended up very blurry.Pictures look OK in highest resolution mode, but take up too much space on the palm. (As compared to a higher-resolution JPG file downloaded to the palm that looks better and takes half the space).The software worked well, except for the separately downloadable eyecontact (address book) - which for me reset my palm whenever I tried to add a new address entry."
3,"A fun toy, but needs some refining","I have had the eyemodule for a few weeks now and have had a lot of fun playing with it. Some things I wish I had known before I got it: there is no software to download your pictures to a Mac yet (it is on the way according to the eyemodule site, but no projected release date), it is a good idea to get the backup module if you do not already have it because the eyemodule drains the batteries faster when you use it, so you will want the option to backup and swap the batteries on the fly. In fact, when the eyemodule is in the module slot, the battery indicator reads lower than it actually is, but when it is removed, it will jump back up a little. Overall, I found the eyemodule a lot of fun, and recommend it if that is all you want to use it for at this point. For the serious picture taker, this is not the way to go. PS: I think it is great that amazon is now selling all the Handspring modules in one place!"
4,You Must Get One of These,"I have been very pleased with my eye module equipped Visor Deluxe. I carry it everywhere. There are endless opportunities to capture images all day long and you don't have to worry about film. No, this is not a great camera, but for its size and convenience you can't beat it. My photos have been generally very good. Only a few duds done in poor light.Sometimes you can't tell how good the shots are until you've loaded them on to your PC (which is a snap). I have started sending daily photos to all my friends via E mail. Yes, you can take your own photo. Get your hands on one of these soon!"
4,"Great Product, can't wait for the new generation","I bought this camera as auxillary digital camera, boy is it worth it! The camera clicks right into your Visor and your shooting. Great for business and spur of the moment moments, you know the times you say ""I wish I had a Camera"". One Caveat, all color pictures need a good cleaning on any photo program. This camera is obviously a sign of things to come as the Visor and its accessories continue to improve."
5,Worth the Money,"We bought the eyemodule 2 for a very specific purpose, and we couldn't be happier.My wife works as a script supervisor on feature films. She is required to take pictures of each scene, label them and keep a database of scene-related information for the director. The eyemodule is ideal for this job.With eyemodule she is able to take a picture, write out a label before saving it, beam it over to the computer (with the label intact) and insert it in her database. No muss, no fuss.It's small, it's easy to operate, and the pictures aren't bad. And she could not have done the labeling in-camera as easily with any digital camera on the market.Keep in mind that the pictures are low rez. But if you want to have some fun snapping digital pics, transferring them to the computer, e mailing them, etc. this is a good choice. And the ""movie"" function is fun, too."
1,Eyemodule not Ready!,"Disappointing is an understatement. Even with the best 'photo' enhancing software, you were hard press to clean-up the image. The concept and use are great, but developers should of waited til they could get a decent pixel count before releasing this not ready for primetime module. I took mine back within a week. You can get a very good 1.3 million pixel digitial camera for about ... and they are very easy to use."
3,Ok to use for fun,I use my with my Hand Spring Palm Pilot. It works OK but the photo quality is only fair. I only purchased it to expand my Handspring visors capabilities
4,Useful and fun.,"The Eyemodule 1 I just replacedhas provided images that are really useful and fun to take, spur of the moment. It captures the essence, if not the detail of the subject that can be edited into sketchbook images and saved to an address file an email or an illustrated newsletter. It is also great as a visual memo pad or recorder, capturing images on the fly for reviewing later. Stealth factor makes it fun, too.So now I have gotten an Eyemodule 2 and will let you know how it differs."
4,Don't expect 3 megapixel quality,"I bought the Eyemodule right when it first came out. I was hoping for somewhat better quality than what was delivered. But after using it for a while, and seeing how handy the product is, I began to soften. Don't expect 3 megapixel quality. It's a springboard module, for goodness sake. It does EXACTLY what is says it will do. I've used it to take pictures of people I've just met at business meetings. I've take pictures of scribblings on white boards. All spur of the moment when no one has a bulky digital camera at the ready. For all those who hate the Eyemodule, I say: If you want super-duper quality, but a 3 megapixel digital camera. If you want spontaneous photography and fun, go for the Eyemodule. Enjoy. It's worth it."
2,Customer Service Is Very Poor!,"I purchased a Face Caddy a week ago. It's very uncomfortable and doesn't do a good job of targeting the TMJ area. The Face Caddy covers the ears completely causing them to hurt from the heat or cold pack. I've placed numerous calls to John Lucas@facecaddy.com who never answers his phone and doesn't return phone calls. Very poor customer service. Beware, once you purchase a Face Caddy you're stuck with it."
5,Helpful heat,I bought this to use with heat to relax my jaw muscles prior to doing my TMJ exercises. It works great and I like having my hands free while I wait for the relaxation to kick in.
4,"Keep it close, and get that shot","You never know when a photo opportunity might present itself. If you're like me, it will be when your nice, full-size camera is not around. So, I got this little Sony to carry along with my car keys and wallet. This plan works great. I've managed to snag some great shots simply because I had this little camera nearby.The Good:Very small and portable256 MB stick holds over 200 imagesVery good image qualityThe Bad:Slow shutter speed; not good for action shotsThe So-SoEven a modest zoom would be niceI'd like a larger hole in the carry strap lug, so I could put it on a keyring or such.Overall, I'm quite happy with the quality of images, fit and function of the unit. I would NOT suggest it as a primary camera (there are better ones out there for the same money) but if you would like to have a ""carry it with me all the time"" camera, and never miss a shot, this Sony is the way to go."
3,"Raw,Rockin,Live ,Rockabilly!","Raw Rockin Live Rockabilly by a living legend well into her sixties. You may remember her as the granny that played circles around Brian Setzer in a Beer commercial a few years back. Well she does,play circles around Setzer that is.Her playing style falls into the same catagory as her ""rockabilly grandkids"", Dexter Romweber formerly of ""The Flat Duo Jets"" ,and Poison Ivy of ""The Cramps"". She is a one of a kind original and this record comes with the higfhest recommendations.A+"
1,One mistake and heaven and earth split apart,"Eido Roshi is the preeminent Rinzi Zen Master in America. Or is he? Eido states in this book that water for tea brought to a boil slowly stays hot much longer than water brought to a boil quickly. However, scientific experimentation will show that both waters cool at the exact same rate! (The basic 5 tau slope of decay is familiar to all science students.) Behold, a Japanese Zen Master who makes inaccurate observations regarding tea! Followers of the Way, do not waste your time munching these black beans."
4,Uses of Grammar textbook,"More than likely, if you are looking to purchase this text for a college class, you don't care if it has a good review! But this text seems complete (exhaustive) and authoritative, and the authors give examples that make their explanations easy to understand. But, all-in-all, it is grammar!"
2,No title,I expected more of this book; specifically bought it because it was referenced in one of Stephen King's novels. Live and learn.
1,Pulp Fiction,"I disagree with the reviews of others here. I found it very pulpish and utterly ridiculous. I managed to finish it, but in retrospect, I should have left it 1/2 way through."
5,Can't Go Wrong,"I've now had this watch for five months and it is by far the best looking watch I have ever had. (I love carbon fiber.) The titainium makes it very light for its size, it functions as advertised. I have put the features to the test and have found the watch to be very accurate. There isn't a light to read the watch in the dark with but I haven't found that to be a problem since giving up my cat burgler job. :-)"
4,Rockin' Chair/Let's Straighten It Out,Received the shipment faster than I had expected and in good condition. Enjoy listening to this CD...and don't to preserve my old tape copy that I recorded from the radio a few years back.
2,do NOT attempt to use for espresso coffee,"OK for drip and coarser functions, but due to the cheapness of the burr holders and excessive vibration, it cannot maintain the consistent coffee particle size needed for espresso. for that you would at least need the Gaggia MDF espresso grinder. -- The GRINDER is IMO, MORE important than the machine!"
1,Very disappointed,"I have been using a Cirque Power Cat for years and loved it. I bought the Easy Cat for two reasons: 1) the Power Cat does not plug directly into USB and I bought a new computer that has only USB, no DB9 connector, and 2) I'm unable to get the scrolling and zoom feature to work using the Power Cat on the new computer (running Windows XP Professional).The Easy Cat is very small, which I didn't like, but can live with. The USB cable comes out the right side which is rediculous. It should come out the top. The USB cable doesn't reach my computer, so I had to move things around to connect it. But, the clincher was that the touchpad doesn't work. I can't move the mouse cursor. The scrolling worked and the zoom worked, but not the mouse-move. The product is, therefore, useless."
3,Storybook Comes to Life,"Watching Pinocchio truly was like having the story read to you and the pictures coming to life. It was more of a theatrical presentation than one would expect in a movie. The English dubbing was a bit distracting as it did not match very well. Overall, this was the most enjoyable version of Pinochio I have ever seen. As an adult I laughed the most, my twelve year old enjoyed it, my seven year old said it was ""weird"" but he liked watching it (especially the shark scene), and it kept our one year old's attention watching the very flexible Pinocchio jump around the screen (he was an excellent Pinocchio)."
1,worst movie of the year,This movie is horrible. The dubbing of the movie in English couldn't have been worse. Watching Roberto Benigni jump around in his pajamas and bread hat for almost 2 hours was so very painful. If I had not been with my 2 children I would have left after 20 minutes. Avoid this movie like the plague.
1,Painful to watch...,"I haven't usually written reviews. This movie just moved me to do so, however. It nearly moved me out of the theater after 45 minutes, too. If not for the fact that my two children were watching, I would have split.OK, so the English over-dubbing was to be expected, but it was done poorly creating a soundtrack that seemed not to fit with the movie. Either the volume or the synchronization or the character of the voice was off. The characters had so little connection between them that you wondered why some of them cared about each other (e.g. the fairy caring for Pinocchio). Benigni was, at times, so farcical as to be annoying. Things happened in disjointed sequences.All in all, I wouldn't even wait for the video. Be a good boy and spend your gold on something else."
5,Fantastic surprise,"I purchased this DVD to show it to my students for our Italian class. Well, not only the DVD was like new. It was a double DVD (2 DVDs in the same case), one in Italian with subtitles and one dubbed in English. I gave the English version to a friend of mine whose kid is 5 years old and loves Pinocchio! Thank you Amazon!"
1,Quite Possibly The Worst Movie Ever Made!!!,"I went to see Pinocchio (don't ask why) but I was expecting something a little better than what I am glad I didn't pay to see. The look of the film was wonderful, a likely sort of farie tale look to it, but the dubbing reminded me of those old Kungfu movies I used to see as a kid. I mean it was pretty awful! The dubbing of Pinocchio is was the proverbial nail in the coffin for this movie, it was not just annoying as somebody scraping a chalkboard but it was down right painful to endure. I saw kids dozing off or running around the movie theater ignoring the movie entirely. THIS WAS THE WORSE MOVIE OF THE SUMMER! I would rather see Hudson Hawk nine hundred times in one sitting than see this movie a second time, this time all the way through! This movie is probably played in some low circle of Hades as a form of eternal punishment!"
4,Plaid Tidings,"This is a delightful a cappella Christmas CD...especially enjoyable if you have seen either one of the ""Plaid"" shows (Forever Plaid or Plaid Tidings)."
1,Not worth purchasing,"Even if you are a true PLAID fan, you won't like this CD. It's a waste of your money."
1,terrible!,This CD's sound is not very good at all. There is a harsh sort of fuzz going on in the background that gets very irritating to the ears after about five minutes! I wouldn't waste my time or money on this one.
1,nothing great...,"IMO this is just an average work: cheesy lyrics, repeated formula (beautiful girls - ugly guys), lack of harmonies in the ""cookie monster"" vocals... the only track with ""something"" was TTTSNB. TSOTB has so much to learn from tristania..."
2,More Bad Norwegian Female Vocals and Mediocre Music,"Yes, I know Liv Kristine is Norwegian but her vocals don't do anyhthing for me eather. This album is ruined by the same whining, comical female vocals that seem to accompany every Norwegian release. It is time for an international treaty banning vocalists who sing clearly but must be someone in the bands girlfriend or wife. Get a Within Temptation or Left Hand Solution album instead."
4,Great back-to-nature read!,"A fun and funny book to read if you ever dabbled in the countercultural ""back-to-nature movement"" of the '70's or the looked ahead to the coming ""social collapse"" the in '20s as a survivalist determined to live off the land without destroying the rest of it. And a love story to boot. Thought provoking read."
1,Total piece of garbage,"This unconscionable rip-off comes with two ""rockets."" I launched the first one and one of the blades dropped off. The second rocket did get into the air 5 or 6 times but never achieved anything like the altitude claimed on the packaging. It reached 40 feet at the most. After about a half dozen flights, one of the stabilizer fins tore away from the fuselage and the rocket failed to attain even its earlier disappointing altitude. I had to apologize to my 5 year old son because this piece of junk had been one of his birthday presents.I emailed Monkey Business, but they never responded. I also purchased a 99 cent rubber band-launched heli-rocket at the dollar store. It goes higher and still hasn't broken. Don't be a sucker; don't buy this or any Monkey Business product. You may notice that I gave the product two stars for educational merit -- well, I did learn a lesson."
5,"Awesome!,Amazing!(you get the point)","I loved this book! It had everything. Fantasey,love,mystery(sorta)It is now one of my fav books."
3,light of the oracle,"It was a good read. She keeps the dialog moving, the action filled with adventure and the storyline intriguing."
4,Not for everyone,This novel won the Pulitzer Prize. It is a story set in the South and involves a hard working family strugglingto make ends meet. Well-written.
1,Too much description.,"I enjoy a good read, especially one that the characters in the story move along with their words & dialogue. I read 79 pages into this Pulitzer Prize winner and had no idea ""what"" was going on. Lots of flowery description, but, frankly, boring. Sorry."
3,okay,"the product came NOT as pictured. after cooking, it was average. it took more time for me to locate the product than it was worth."
3,Patti!,"Patti, you've got to love her. She's either wonderful and sublime, or she falls flat on her face. Think about Radio Ethiopia, gems like Pissin in a river, combined with the incredibly self indulgent title cut. This book is a bit like that, all over the lot. Her poetry, however, sounds a lot better coming from her mouth than on the printed page. What we need from Patti is a live album, taken from her glory days. It would be one of the greatest ever, better than the new Clash live album."
5,Excellent condition,"Although I am not loving all of the poetry in this volume, I purchased the book for two particular poems and because I prefer hard cover volumes but frequently cannot afford them. This arrived in excellent condition and now I have the poems I was searching for to use in class."
4,Bank of Fears,"A good read, but not quite up to ""Body of Lies"". I did like Sam Hoffman's sensitivity."
2,A spy novel with the usual cliches,"Bank of Fear is a ""no-brains-required"" spy thriller with all the usual cliches: heroes who are quick to fall in love and even quicker to rush into danger; villains with unlimited power and unquenchable thirsts for violence; complicated computer systems that (surprise!) a novice hacker learns to crack; and an abundance of utterly silly plot twists, double crosses, and character surprises. The story is so completely nonsensical I had a hard time remembering what happened to the characters ten minutes after I put the book down.The one redeeming quality of the book is that it's a very fast read. Things happen so quickly and the pages keep turning, so you don't ever think to ask yourself why you're wasting time reading it."
1,poor recording,"The various nature sound CDs of Suzanne Doucet, et al, are of poor quality and not worth the money. If you are looking for higher quality, clearer recordings, purchase nature/ambient sounds from the Laser Light label, or check out National Geographic's website."
5,A good blend of storytelling and fun,"We got ""Math Blaster"" for our six-year-old, who has been a very savvy computer user since he was 18 months old. It was so difficult to maneuver the character (jump over wrong answers, run through correct ones) he actually cried over it.Mia's math is much more gentle. The storytelling does take up time in the game, but it seems to give them a rest between problems. There is geometry (""which figure has two congruent sides?""), basic math facts (""2 + 5"" on level 1, ""2 x 4 x 3"" on level 4), following directions (""take the tunnel on the lower right""), and telling time (""move the clock back 3 hours"").We have had the game for about two weeks, and so far it's getting played every day. Our older son plays it at level 3 or 4, and our little one (four years old) plays it at level 1 with a bit of help.I have not yet found out where to find the ""report card"" - I have asked their tech support."
2,Difficult to navigate,"I found this software very difficult to use. It does not have any ""Stop"" or ""Go Back"" button. The only way to exit an activity is to hit ""Esc"" button to exit the program and then start all over. When starting over, there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and I could not find a way to skip it."
4,Mia's Math is DIFFERENT!,"Mia's math is an adventure game with an occasional math-based activity thrown in. The math skills are quirky, not your usual drill-and-kill practice. It really requires some higher-level thinking. I'm using it with third-grade students, and they are frequently challenged. My only complaint is that the user-interface is too simple. You can save games, but there's no way (that I've found so far) to jump to certain areas, other than restoring a saved game. Mia gets irritated if you linger too long somewhere. She likes to keep it moving! My nine-year-olds are enthralled!"
3,Not easy to use,The few Zymol products I own are very good. This one is just ok. It's hard to wipe out and leaves a white film on the paint. One needs to rub to get it off. I'm not going to purchase it again.
4,A Fascinating Introduction to Indian Myths and Legends.,"India has a cultural heritage of a wide variety of myths and legends linked to religious beliefs and philosophical interpretation of the universe. These are contained in the written and oral traditions of the Indian epics like the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the stories of the Puranas and Vedas. ""Indian Myths & Legends"" gives an excellent introduction to these stories and narrates a few important ones along with paintings and illustrations. There are more than fifty such full-page color illustrations, which is a great strength of the book. A glossary of Sanskrit terms at the end is also helpful to the western reader. For anyone interested in the stories from India this is a valuable book of introduction."
5,Granite harbor,"Great book;story is well-written. The reader almost becomes part of the story. I bought it at a library sale when I was 14, and read it many times. Our 2 daughters have read it, and one of them, now 47, and a teacher, keeps the tattered and much read book in a safe place. Every once in a while she gets it out and reads through it in an evening. It is just a nice story. I agree, (that as with a lot of geat literature), parts of it are a little dated, which does not hurt the story at all."
3,"Good music, bad vocals","Every knows this is Arthurian concept album. Overdone concept, but I personally interested in the theme, so a plus for the album.Music is good. Various ""nonmetal"" instruments make their appearance here; nicely situated around the non-nonsense heavy metal playing which enhance the concept of the album. Good segues and riffs. A plus for the album.... but the vocals... ruff and gruff, almost death metal-like without the lyrics and IMHO, they don't fit the album. In fact they detract from it. I personally like good melodic vocalists( B. Dickinson, Klaus Meine etc) so perhaps I am missing something here. Were they going for something? (This is the first Grave Digger album I have listened to).With enough spins, I will adjust to the vocals, but until then, 3 stars."
4,Crushing old-school metal,"Grave Digger doesn't pull any punches. Their guitar riffs are firmly planted in '80s conventions, but their sound is heavy and crushing with '90s production values. The heaviness approaches Nevermore proportions on the latest release, ""Excalibur."" Nevertheless, the songwriting is not as good as on their best release to date, ""Tunes of War."" Like ""Tunes"" and their previous release ""Knights of the Cross,"" ""Excalibur"" is a concept album, based on Malory's ""Morte d'Arthur.""This album is big on big gang choruses and relentless riffage. I sort of wish that the lead singer had used his shrill ""Miss Piggy"" squeal more often on this album, and that the songs were a little less predictable. For those reasons, I considered giving this album a 3, but I'll settle for a low 4. Incidentally, the bonus track, ""Parcival,"" is indeed worthwhile, one of the better tracks on the CD."
5,this band knows how to pull metal from the stone,"grave digger definitely knows how to pull metal from a stone and its metal rings true. for more italian metal bands, check out labyrinth, lacuna coil, and white skull."
3,"Disappointment because not enough clues to say, ""murder.""","I felt let down after reading Holy Terror in the Hebrides because the incident in the cave did not really develop into a murder except in Dorothy's imagination. The real terror was the storm not the supposed murder. I also felt that her response when she came out her door to go to the church was a bit overdone, considering the state of her arthritic knees. I like a bit of romance, but the scene at the end was as quick as spilt milk and I was left thirsty for a bit more. However, the descriptions were great and I wanted to see Iona for myself, eat the delicious food and even try the haggis."
2,Nonexistent plot.,I really enjoy the Dorothy Martin character; she's wonderfully self-confident and true to herself at all times. But this book is just barely a mystery--I felt really let down at the end. Great characters and interesting setting can't make up for a weak (to be generous) plot.
4,Holy Terror in the Hebrides,"If you've been to the Isle of Iona and Staffa, you must fead this book. It is exactly as the author describes it. If you are easily frightened, don't read it before you go!"
5,Dorothy goes on vacation?,"And what a vacation she has...In this 3rd book, Jeanne Dams takes us to the Isle of Iona in the Scottish Hebrides....a beautiful place, pleaceful, historical, spiritual, and at the stame time... stormy, wild, unyielding and meloncholy. Dorothy sees an accident..BUT, is it an accident? She jumps right in to convince others that it wasn't but no one seems to believe her....she is surrounded by a group of Americans who don't like each other...don't worry, Dorothy to the rescue! Another good story from Jeanne Dams whose descriptions of the island made me feel as if I were there the whole time and had a vacation myself....Margie"
5,Great Follow-Up,"Sometimes you have a great record and a follow-up that is somehow weaker. Not here, Valerie's second album is as good as number one, great new material, lots of variety, and, of course, her fantastic voice. I can't make a decision which album is better, ""Patchwork Heart"" or ""Turtle Wings"", they are both amazing!"
3,this will fall off,i was stoked at first to finally get Russian stickers for my laptop keyboard as i am Russian myself and it's tons easier to type instead of going on translit.ru. however in a month or so half of those peeled leaving sticky residue and now i have only less than a half of them left. i found a translit software instead which lets me use the same layout as English to make up Russian words.
1,Missed Opportunity,"Short Cut to Nirvana, lacks proper research about the grand Hindu Festival, it is purely sensationalized. It misses the basic essence of calmness, devotion of people going to the Ganges River, rather it focuses on exotic and naked sadhus. I also watched the other film on Kumbh called Kumbh Mela: Songs of the River, it has that calmness and allows the viewers to make their own judgment without too many talking heads. In other words, it is more meditative."
1,Sensationalist and Exoticizing!,"This film has no depth. It barely skims the surface of Kumbh Mela--and that, from a naive, outsider's perspective. It focuses merely on the sensational, and in so doing, exoticizes Kumbh Mela and the people partaking in it. Moreover, the slow-motion scenes and music were so melodramatic, it almost seemed like a parody (especially the scene with the trance-dancing girl)!"
2,"So so, more freakshow than spiritual journey","I wasn't too impressed with this film. It was hyped up quite a bit when it came out, but I don't think it delivered. It seemed to be, basically, a small bunch of wide-eyed naive Westerners being led around by a young swami of dubious character. He showed them all the crazy far-out gurus and swamis and guys who stretch out their genitals, etc. I think that had the filmmakers known their subject matter a little better the film would have been much better. Instead we are experiencing a proxy version of these young astonished, but ultimately ignorant, foreigners' quasi-religious carnival ride. It also seemed to wander around in it's subject matter. By the end I was just glad to be able to move on to watch something else. Also, why did someone tag this film with ""Bhutan""?"
2,Dissappointed!,"Shortcut to Nirvana:If you are looking for the sensational aspect of mystic India, this is perhaps a good movie to watch. I was dissappointed! This film fails to capture the spiritual intent and solemnity of the Kumbh Mela. Pilgrims eagerly look forward this rare festival for spiritual reasons! These ""other diversions"" are meant to inspire us to move beyond the material limitations. The story line of the film was weak and failed to inspire many of those who watched it with me."
2,Not What you Would think,"Ok, I had really high expectations for this film, thinking it was going to document the Kubh Mela, but it doesn't really. This film does give a over view of the festival but it really documents a few westerners being lead around by a painfully goofy ""swami"". The makers of this film really stuck to alot of the over the top antics that can be found on the surface of such a gathering. Again, if this was a in debth documentry of the festival it would have been much better. The true high lights of this film are H.H. The Dalai Lama as well as the bonus interviews with the featured teachers that are minutely woven through out this film. If you buy this (or rent it) don't miss the bonus stuff at the end, its basic dharma stuff which could have been much better if the interviewer knew what they were doing but a few of the interviews are really wonderful if just to see the love and open hearts of a few great teachers."
2,Dissapointing,"This album is dissapointing at best. The best song is the single ""Dem Boyz"". The only other good track on here is the one featuring a tired Eazy E sample ""Gangstas"". ""Happy Jams"" is pretty decent as well, the rest of the CD is repetitive to a point where it will actually start to bore you. These three songs saved this subpar album from being a complete and utter loss."
5,Boyz N da Hood,"This cd is off the hook!!! The whole cd is just as good as their first single ""Dem Boyz""..If they keep it up they will have a long successful carrer!!"
5,Boyz N Da Hood da best album,I like Boyz N Da Hood album now that I have listened to it. Because when I first heard the song Dem Boyz I thought that it was jive but I listened to the words I really love that song. If I was to rate the group I would give them all 5 stars because I like the group and also because I am from Atl where they are from. But Jody Breeze and Young Jeezy needs to keep on doing da d*** thang. But N*E*Wayz I would like to give the album all stars plus more.
3,CLASSIC???,"Okay, I know I'm gonna sound like a hater for this review, but I'm not. I like the music. It's catchy and raw, but should we go so far as to call it a classic? I think not. This is yet another mediocre, mainstream, southern album. And you can't give it a classic title just because it came from a washed-up producer who just happened to pull a hit out of his a**. I think we should just appreciate this as another southern crunk album. Nothing more, yet nothing less. And no offence to the people in the southen parts who respect the album because it represents their culture. I'm a hip-hop fan who respects good music. The whole album, like I said is kind of routine. Slow, synth-filled beats with raw intinsity. I would say it is better than most southern albums out right now. Its more raw and alot less poppy. The music is good, but classic???"
2,they don't deserve to walk in nwa's shoes,eazy's turning over in his grave right now puff's just trying to cash in on the southern hip hop flavor since the south is hot right now but caling them the next nwa is a bit much first comparing 50 to 2pac was bad enough I woujld never buy this trash.
2,This album was mediocre...BUT...,"I want to start off by saying that this album in no way shape or form is a classic..it was a big disappointment to me, honestly. But all of you that want to use this one CD as an excuse to down the south...y'all need to open ya eyes and realize what's goin' on right now..Quoted from ya boy Tony Yayo himself(Allhiphop.com)--referring to the G-Unit and the South...""We, WE, have New York City on our back. Right now Down South is running the Rap game. Atlanta, Texas, everywhere else is running the rap game. We the only ones out of New York City that's making noise. Jay-Z is gone. Besides that, ain't nobody making noise. That's why you got Mike Jones selling more [his first week] than Fat Joe's first week. `Cause dudes is putting out garbage!""It could not have been stated any better. A fad? Y'all seriously need to wake up..."
2,Another subpar bad boy south album,"Jody Breeze needs to leave P Diddy and hook up w/ someone who knows the south. Puffy hasn't put out a good album since Biggie died, and now he's trying out southern rap? Nice try Diddy but these guys could have done a lot better if the beats were worth the crap...oh and if 3 of them were gone."
1,STRAIGHT DOO DOO,"THIS ALBUM WAS SOO BAD I ALMOST WAS IN TEARS WHEN I HIT THE LAST TRACK....THIS IS ONE THE WORST ALBUMS EVER, WITH GORILLA ZOE THEY ACTUALLY DO A BIT BETTER AND HAVE ATLEAST ONE OR TWO BANGERS...BUT THIS ONE WAS GARBAGE FROM START TO FINISH"
4,Boyz N Da Hood,The newest act to drop from Bad Boy has been labelled the south NWA.While this album didn't move as many units as any NWA albums i think in their next few albums will sell more especially with Lil Wayne now in the group although they lost Jeezy who in my opinion fits in this group better then Weezy will.Anyway this album is a solid debut from BNDH with the stand-out track being the first single Dem Boyz.Most of the songs are fairly strong with a few missteps on the way but that is expected.Beats are solid and all 4 of the guys can spit it.Can't wait for their next album to drop in early 2006 althought it will probably be pushed back.Bad Boy is coming back strong in 2006 and i hope the new artists like chopper and ness can carry the torch for Bad Boy along with BNDH and hopefully Black Rob.
5,This is tha hottest,Boyz n da hood are a fresh new group. The best thing to group to happen to bad boy since da band broke up. This cd is defenitaly a must have to any hip hop collection. Boyz n da hood have quickly become one of my favorite groups. Buy this cd you wont regret it.
5,Off Tha Hook,"The boyz n da Hood album is tight, I mean it's what every thug,gangsta, or just a music person want's to hear. It's crunk andyou can really take your anger out when you listen to it. It speakes to you and if you don't have it go get it."
1,Not Hood,"This Album offers nothing, just another terrible southern rap group. Young Jeezy offers some talent but he really needs to speed up his flow and stop with the raspness bullish. Its all the same southern s hit same flow same sound, lyrics are wack and its about the same hustle s hit."
5,so great!!!!!,"oyz in da hood album was so great i mean i got it in 6 in the moring at a local music store right when it was shipped, any way it was so great and the lyrics were awesome . the album is one of the greatest album ever made even better than the 50 cent massacre. this fresh group hada pimpin album that would blast your car so i suggest u stop talking and go get yourself a copy!!!"
1,Puffy is just desperate at this point,Boyz N Da Hood make you long for the days of No-Limit Records&Cash Money. this is like a 4th tier take on those Acts.Puffy seems truly either out of date or desperate to have His own Down dirty South Act.Boyz N Da Hood sound about 3-4 years too late on these tracks. nothing stands out&Not even Puffy can make this believable.
4,The south is...,"Let me start first by saying this album is tight. Don't let the Diddy persona confuse ya, this is some hard stuff that's bumpin' straight out the south. Tight rhymes and beats make dem boyz n the hood go hard especially if you like that bass in your trunk. Check out tracks like 7 - Don't Put Ya Hands On Me and 9 - Trap Ni***z.Now, I read a lot of reviews and it seems to me that the south still ain't getting no respect no matter how many albums that's been sold over the last few years. Southern rappers are steppin to the plate and swingin for the fences and its about time that the industry has thrown a few over the plate. Just because have of y'all don't get whats going on down south don't mean it could be regulated to garbage by folks who can't get the southern slang and dialect. It ain't just the folks in the south by these records y'all..."
1,this is supposed to b gangsta?,how all yall fools gonna come up in here calling this trash gangsta.. Kali is where the real ridas live and die notthe dirty.. DIRTY... south or the LEAST coast.. everyone since the mid 90's has bitten the west coast and this is no exception.. tha frontlinerz have a track called ''gangsta in me'' and they put it right on these so-called gangsta's callin themselves trap ni66az.. this is a joke.. like everything else and whoever said this isnt commercial.. give it up.. this record is sitting on wal-marts shelves!!! i heard this and had one serious laugh.. boyz n da hood... another example of how you suckers bite the west...
4,"Good, but some small mistakes","This good book if you want to know about the history of Lando Calrissian and his droid Vuffi Raa, but there are some small things that would have made the book a bit better. Instead of saying hyperspace, the author put faster-than-light. And there's only small mentions of the Empire, and Lando's hanging around systems barely anybody's ever heard of before. But the conversation Lando's having with the Hall in the pyramid of the Sharu was kind of humorous, so I recommend it if you're a big Star Wars fan (like me) and want to expand your knowledge of the Star Wars universe."
4,Good product,"The size of the product was a little wider than I expected, but it is a well made broom and dustpan and does a good job cleaning up hardwood floor messes."
3,Perfect for Lice or Dandruff!,"I needed a smaller version of the Pan and Brush Set so commonly found in Amish households. Mainly I needed it for picking up Lice or loose Dandruff that falls from my hair when I have scratched my scalp all day. I don't like to leave a mess on the table so I just scoop it up and put it in the Convection microwave Oven with some corn on the cob. This is a good tool for that.If you need something for bigger jobs or if you plan on breaking alot of bottles when you're drunk, then get a regular size Pan and Brush Set."
2,Disappointing - misshapen,"I am usually a big fan of OXO products. Ordered this pan, and when I used it the first time, I realized that half of the dirt goes underneath the dust pan. Turns out the front lip on mine is warped and doesn't completely touch the floor. Kinda defeats the purpose of a dustpan. The brush seems nice. Too bad."
2,OXO made a mistake,"I'll begin by saying that I typically LOVE OXO products. In my experience, they're a step above the competition. They look better, feel better, perform better and they last longer.Not this time. Here's the deal.The handle on the ""broom/brush"" is bizarre. I don't know, it's like ergonomic-friendly for a gorilla. The black rubber ""knob"" that you hold is just wrong. It's too fat and angled weird. You're not sure how to hold it. This is the case for girls and guys alike.Plus, the bristles on the brush aren't firm enough at all. They're soft as feathers and barely sweep up a thing.What a bummer. I had the rubbermaid version in my shopping cart, but switched at the last moment when I saw the OXO choice. (Which again, is more $$ but usually worth it.)Choose another dustpan and broom/brush."
2,dust pan and brush,I was looking for a small brush to collect bread crumbs from the table cloth. It is not suitable for this purpose as the brush is too still
5,Good dustpan and brush,It's surprisingly hard to find a good dustpan and brush. I got fed up with cheap ones that leave a trail of dust on the floor after collection. This one doesn't. Perfectly happy with this product.
3,Requires one alteration,"It's actually a pretty good dust pan. Works really well at avoiding the ""lines"" of dirt usually present with dust pans. There's one issue though that seems like QC should've notice. The rubber bulb of a handle comes off really easily. I ended up fixing it with some silicone sealant."
2,Buggy and incomplete,"This book is an adequate introduction to the creation of custom controls, including design-time support.I give it only two stars because:1) It does not give you enough in-depth information to create real-world custom controls. It is just a brief introduction.2) The source code is rubbish. It is poorly formatted, has annoying typos (with no errata on the SAMS website, though you can download the code) and looks like it was written by people with shaky concepts of how .NET code should be written.I especially like the content-free XML comments. Nice.Unfortunately, I don't think there is a better book out there. The only other source of custom control info is the web, which can be kind of spotty. If you are an author and you know custom controls, please write a better book than this one."
2,Not very useful,This book is quite luke warm. Most of the book is source code that actually has a few errors. The source code included makes up ~1/3 of the already slim book. I would have rather seen an attached disc or a website I could go to to download the source. The book breifly discusses some main topics including distribution and GDI however the book is too thin to actually be very benificial. Most of the concepts are readily available on MSDN or GotDotNet.com. I hate to be harsh but this book failed to introduce so general important concepts including typical custom control layouts invloving a custom arraylist amd arraylistitems.. I have yet to write a control that hasn't used these. Anyway... two start because it does hit some basic concepts but really lacks the warmth and depth need to fully be a custom control development book.
2,I wish there had been another book on this topic...,"To be honest, I bought this book because it was the only one I have found so far specifically on the topic of custom controls.In retrospect maybe I should have looked harder or waited longer. While this book does outline the basic concepts pretty well, the author should have spent more time on it.If you're a little compulsive about coding style and consistency (like most professionals are) the examples in this book are going to drive you crazy! Weeks doesn't stick to any particular naming convention - the code just looks like a hack job. Sorry...But it's true.In all fairness, the book does put all the pertinent topics in one place and it's pretty short. So, despite it's faults the book will get you up and running faster than reading the online help and other resources."
4,Concise and to the point.,"This book is not intended for the beginning C# programmer but for an experienced C# programmer interested in how to make Windows Forms custom controls it is just the right mix of code and explanation. Too many books spend chapter after chapter re-reviewing the basics and trying to be all things to all people. This technology uses the some most advanced parts of C# save for Reflection and is not a beginner's domain. If you are a professional with a limited amount of time to wade through basic review detritus to find the information you need this book is just what you need. It's short and to the point unlike this review. My only complaint is that ""some"" sections are a little thin and the code changes from example to example are not clear enough but that's the editor not the author."
2,WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF PROPERLY REVISED,"This book has got one two positive qualities, but, readers who expect comprehensive details should condition their minds for some sorts of disappointments.It did give a general overview of .NET Windows curriculum, but faltered in its bid to teach .NET developers the intricate procedures, which they need in order to create their own custom controls.On going through the first three chapters, I realized that the author of this book is a brilliant mind who experiences difficulties in teaching others what he knows.Subsequent editions of this book would be sound, if reviewed and edited by more experienced teachers."
2,JAlden,"Disappointing! This short book is mostly sample code, with much repetition. There is very little explanation of the concepts. Code generation(serialization) isn't covered at all. The MSDN site has more and better code samples, also without much in the way of explanation, but at least they are free."
5,great,"Best cd ever, very funny, it brought back old memories of the great commercials that were on tv. Very funny and very fast for it to arrived."
2,ARRRGH!,"Beware! This is not the show Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed that was running on The Learning Channel and Discovery a few years ago. I goofed and bought this disc, which dramatizes 3 stories per episode and challenges the audience to guess which one really happened and which ones are only Urban Myths. The trouble is if you're an Urban Legend enthusiast like me, you already are familiar with these stories and this show doesn't fill in the background on the legends like ""Mostly True Stories"" does. So you end up with some hokey dramatizations which would tip off even someone who has never heard the stories to which ones ""actually happened"". Hence, I can't recommend this DVD to anyone and now I need to try to sell the damn thing. BTW-I didn't buy it on Amazon. I wish I had since I could have saved some money."
1,I do not recommend the product unless...,I will not give it a rating at all for I did not get what I was paying good money. I do not recommend this product unless you get what is pictured. I bought TWO SETS of the shelf dividers thinking that I was going to get what was shown. I instead got shelf diviers to be used with a solid wood shelf. I want to use the dividers on the Rubbermaid shelf as shown. I wasted my money. This is the first product that I have purchased from Amazon and have been totally dissatified.
1,Wrong Shelves,"I ordered shelves to attach to my existing wire closet shelf. They sent me shelves to attach to a wooden shelf, which I cant use. I will send back. When they send me the correct shelves, I will then reveiw them."
4,Great read for motivated professional,"Right to the point book. Covers what you really need to know about specific situations without holding your hand through the ""how to"". As a person who's been involved in fast moving IT projects I feel like this book really covers what you need to know to be on the right path to a successful project. I wouldn't use it as a bible but if you're looking for food for thought as a young project manager this is a great option."
4,Excelent Service,"I was very pleased with with CDI Watches. Through a glitch at the Amazon site, I received the wrong watch. When notified of this, CDI Watches promptly sent me a return UPS label and provided a refund when it turned out they did not have the watch I wanted in stock. They even went the extra step of locating a seller,on Amazon, where I could buy the watch. That kind of service is rare in today's world. I recommend them highly."
5,As a death metal band they have no talent but its funny,These guys are funny as hell and the music is decent a best but I still love the cd.
3,Just a note on the cover....,"I don't have anything to add, review-wise, other than to say that the cover model (unbeknownst to him, probably) is none other than Pete Shelly of the Buzzcocks."
2,Very 80's,"Oh please. Doesn't the songs on this CD sound just a bit too 80's for anyone? I was given this CD from a friend in China, who praised it to the skies and made me listen to the whole thing in one setting. It felt very surreal. Maybe it's a European thing..."
5,You must see the two-part from Season 3,"The episode ""When she was bad, she was horrid"" features the amazing acting talents of Sarah Polley, playing two parts, the sweet Sara Stanley, and the pick-pocket Jo Pitts. The young actress goes much deeper than some crude behavior and language. She walks, talks, even looks different in the two roles. Watch her face, and observer her, and you'll be impressed.Of course, the rest of the episodes are classic, warm, Avonlea that we all love. The characters are flawed, but forgiving and seeking forgiveness. Would that the world were more like Avonlea.John C"
2,Shanghai Surprise???,"interesting showcase of China's beautiful city, so modern, sleek, welcoming, but how real is this? All I know is that after the 2008 Olympics not one negative thought, review, opinion was heard so am rather suspicious of over the top culture promotion... knowing their gentle, shy, quiet and xenophobic attributes, how on earth did Sheri O portray such a completely annoying loud in your face but helpful physician....always a noble intention to remind us in Malibu to quit complaining when you are invited into a world of poverty, disease, and lack of resources, to highlight organizations that exist to help at great personal sacrifice, but the absolutely beautiful woman at the end who was the recipient of a facial deformity surgery looks soooo perfect, maybe a last minute replacement for the less attractive one, like on opening day of olympics situation... I applaud those who do this work and hope the media blackout improves.."
4,A good message movie in these cynical times,I must admit there were a few times during this film that the acting and scripting was a bit off... however taken as a whole it was good film for the family and also one that causes a moment of reflection on how too often people in modern society are too self-centered on only their own existence and take for granted the good things they have to be grateful for.
5,Mika Boorem,"Very heart warming. From a self centered Malibu girl who cared too much about herself, awakened to the other side of life."
4,ODD MIX OF COMEDY AND DRAMA ...JUDD MAKES IT WORK!,"It's hard to believe I never saw of this film growing up. I saw all the other ""Brat Pack"" movies but , I never even heard of this. I was happy to sit down and see a cast of actors who would become more famous in later years. The film's first act has some very funny(and ridiculous!)court rooms shenanigans and then it turns to a little more serious side. The film flips back to more outrageous comedy and then gets kind of dark, it's all a little uneven to say the least but, I did enjoy it. If your a fan of Judd Nelson you should check this out."
2,Misled by my memory (and all these glowing reviews),"I remember seeing this just once back in the 80s and thinking it was fantastic - then saw these reviews and thought I just had to see it again. Disappointed!!! Is the acting that great? The script is clunky and it has a real ""mediocre midday movie"" feel about it - check out the titles!? Just about ANY episode of Boston Legal (or The Practice for that matter - note David E Kelley credits on this film) has a more engaging plot."
4,Funny Yet Dramatic,A little uneven but worth the ride if you like Judd Nelson and Ray Walston. The supporting cast is great too. A lot of laughs mixed with some intense drama.
4,Funny movie,"An older (80s) movie starring Judd Nelson as an attorney who is basically good at heart, but gets himself in over his head when he becomes too impatient to work himself up the ladder in the conventional way. Pretty predictable ending, a few nice little surprises throughout otherwise. Enjoyable for a summer afternoon of doing nothing!"
4,One of the best voices I've ever heard,"One of the best voices coupled with incredible songwriting, harmonica, and slide playing. Texas blues that not only moves but grooves. Get this along with the other Guy Forsyth CDs. Worth the investment."
3,Okay.,"Wanted to watch this again, but it wasn't as good as I remembered. Still it has Alec Baldwin and Nicole Mismanaged."
5,L S,I ordered Malice in dvd and it arrived quickly within a few days. Condition of the product was superb and the dvd plays absolutely perfectly. I look forward to buying other dvds from this seller and recommend the promptness and the quality the seller commits to its customers.
3,"Good Movie, Contrived ending","Malice has a lot of twists and turns that will keep you wondering where the story is leading, and it is interesting enough to hold you to the end. Unfortunately, the ending is more contrived than clever. There are some good perfomances in this film that make it work. Nicole Kidman really knows how to play a heartless woman. Alec Baldwin's Jed is an egotistical and corrupt doctor who has not completely lost his humanity. One gets the feeling that deep down he feels a little sorry that Andy (played by Bill Pullman)had to get hurt in order to carry out his plan. In the end, he makes it clear that there is a line that he is not willing to cross. Anne Bancroft turns in a great cameo as the scotch drinking mother of Nicole Kidman. The only real weak link in the cast is Bebe Nuewirth as the detective, I found her unconvincing. Overall, if you like mysteries, this is worth seeing."
3,"""a loose remake""","MALICE is ok, but the original (a 1990 TV movie called BODILY HARM) is better. THE OPERATION was the original title.Bodily Harm"
4,Great All star Cast!,"Star studded cast includes Bill Pullman, Nicole Kidman, Alec Baldwin, Anne Bancroft, and Gwyneth Paltrow all gave a Great performance. Excellent Storyline and beautiful scenery. A must-see on your next available weekend!"
4,ENGROSSING MYSTERY THAT WILL KEEP YOU GUESSING,"Malice is a well-plotted, believably acted and skillfully directed thriller with echoes of Hitchcock in some of his more deranged moods. The all-star cast (Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Alec Baldwin, with George C. Scott and Anne Bancroft in supporting roles)carries the script along fluidly, and director Harold Becker carefully manipulates every scene for maximum impact. There's no way to go into the plot itself without giving away some great surprises, but in the case of Malice, ignorance is bliss. Enjoy."
4,Great performances. Good movie,I just realized that the DVD is discontinued so I am lucky enough to get a copy. This is simply a great movie that was overlooked in its theatrical release. The serial killing plot is a bit redundant. Alec Baldwin and Bill Pullman give strong performances. Even Peter Gallagher and the late George C Scott gave excellent supporting performances. Too bad the DVD is not a wide screen version like the LD and there is no 5.1 Surround and also no English subtitling which is major bummer. But like the movie enough for me to justify the purchase of the DVD.
4,More twists and turns than Spaghetti Junction,"It starts out with the appearance of one type of movie, but before long the true plot begins to take shape. There are so many twists that it can get a little confusing, and may take a second viewing just to clear up those loose ends. On the whole, an excellent movie, with some great acting from Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman and Bill Pullman. To go into too much detail about the film runs the risk of spoiling the ending, but if you enjoy Hitchcock thrillers, then you would do well to watch this. Stephen Buxton"
5,Perfect for Christmas,"I feel the message is perfect for the Christmas season. The quiet subtle changes in people's lives makes me want to be better. I was especially pleased that there was no swearing or sex, but just a good clean movie to be long remembered."
5,very touching movie.,"this is a christmas movie everyone should enjoy.it has a great story to tell,and should inspire all who see it.so give it a try,it's on cable and dish,and you may just buy it like i did."
5,an inspiring movie,"no regret of getting this movie. it's really inspiring, a good story to be shared especially during the season of sharing!"
3,It was just O.K.,"I will first say that this is a good family movie; however, if it had not been for Bruce Davison, it would have been flat."
4,Uplifting Christmas Movie,"An enjoyable movie relating the importance of giving rather than receiving during Christmas, but adding the concern for service over the entire year. Our heroine learned how to see the need around her and respond with love to other people's needs. (Loved the powdery snow scene.)"
5,Destined to last forever,A classic in every sense of the word. I recommend it for everyone!!!!!!! If you need a help feeling better watch this movie. Nuances through out with facial expressions and body language were superb. I LOVE THIS MOVIE.
3,Christmas Angel,"OK, full disclosure ... I bought the movie because I'm an extra in it! Having said that, it's a good, clean movie with an uplifting message. Bruce Davison is excellent and elevates everyone's performances whenever he's on screen. The whole family can watch it together."
2,Bad Acting,I really tried to like this movie as it has a good message. But I could not get past the bad acting of the main female character. It was almost as if she was just reading her lines. I liked the other characters though. :)
5,Phenomenal,"Imagine the fusion of technical song-writing nature that shatters the formula, crushing guitar riffs, and the pure chaos brought by grindcore. Ion Dissonance brings it here with their sophomore release, ""Solace"". It's insane and not for the weak minded. With unforgettable riffs and structures in songs like ""O.A.S.D."" and ""Cleansed By Silence"", Ion Dissonance is embedding their name in the current technical music scene. Fans of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Cephalic Carnage, Sleep Terror, Pig Destroyer, Burnt By The Sun, and other bands of the like need to check this album out."
3,"great cd, horrible production","i was really looking forward to this, after hearing the brutal promo song, 'she's strychnine'. that song had an excellent mix, sounded great at high volumes. needless to say, i was very excited for the new ID album.what i got was a great cd with HORRIBLE production. i can't even turn this up loud without getting annoyed at how horrible mix is.i just don't understand how their promo song 'she's strychnine' sounded so insanely good, then they put out a awful sounding album like this. i'm definately disappointed with the sound quality."
2,"May work for bigger bird, but not for my quaker",It may work for bigger bird. But if you have the bird in same size as my quaker parrot. Don't buy it. This treat is way too big and hard for them to chew and eat.
1,A waste of money,"My bird refused to have anything to do with this ""treat"". I think that this product might be more suited for a larger parrot. I was very disappointed."
3,Soundtrtack,The most amazing thing about this film was the song at the end. Would anyone out there know the name and artist or if this film has a soundtrack?
1,Seems We've Read This One Before,"Pat Conroy compares this to a John Grisham novel and I couldn't agree more...except Grisham can actually write clear, concise and consistent prose. This is nothing more than a rip-off of Grisham and all other Southern good ol' boy newspaper-reporter-or-lawyer takes on the cause. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Don't pay any attention to what logicians say,"I'm sure this book was ""readable"" and ""painless"" to people who have degrees in the field, but I found it unnecessarily dry and obscure. Hunter may be a good logician (it's hard for me to say, since after taking the course and reading the book I still have no grasp of the subject), but he has no facility with getting his point across concisely and understandably. If you're a professor considering this book as a text, unless you are HIGHLY competent, nay, EXCELLENT teacher, please reconsider. I must admit that some of my negative opinion about Hunter does come from having a lousy professor and thus a generally miserable time with the material, but if the text had been ""readable"" and ""painless"" and ""an excellent introduction"" I would have been able to learn the stuff myself."
1,Is this complete?,"Please give us the track list, so that we can see if this has the original 'Cease to Exist' on it, which was composed by Charles Manson and released as a B side to 'Bluebirds over the mountain'."
5,Must Have,"I collect Hapkido manuals such as this, from various organizations. This right here, is the gold standard. Fantastic information on the art and several pioneers in the art in the preface is nice to read. There's even some explanation of Ki theory, which is integral to Hapkido. Then there's charts of the Circulatory/Nerve/Skeletal/Pressure Point systems of the body. These charts are very very detailed, and indespensible for a serious martial artist. Following that is the most impressive collection of clearly photographed and explained techniques I have seen assembled in one place. Fantastic."
4,Tedeschis tome,"an excellent tome, suitable mostly for higher grades. It would have been better to publish in several volumes as a 3.6kg book is not convenient to handle."
3,Hapkido American Style,"The overall presentation of this book is very good. It is nicely constructed and the photos are high quality. The problem I have with this text is that it presents the unrealistic, (what I like to call American), version of Hapkido. What I mean by this is that the book details the overly exagerated, very unrealistic, style of Hapkido. The style where though the techniques are very pretty, they are completely unrealistic in hand to hand combat applications. Having first been exposed to Hapkido growing up in South Korea, I can state with authority this is not Korean style Hapkido. Though the book is a great source of basic visual reference, I believe it is important to keep its overall value, to the true student of Hapkido, in perspective, ""Great to look at. But, hard to truly learn from."""
5,Gift for my 25 year old Son. He can't thank me enough!!!,"According to my son, this is the best book about Hapkido that he has ever had! He has been taking these types of courses, on and off, for about 15 years now. Therefore; I recommend this book highly to anyone who is interested in the Martial Arts. P.S. The book is so heavy, if by a long shot someone does not read it right away, it can be used to work out (just by picking it up!), a door stop, a step stool, etc. LOL Enjoy!!!"
5,Unbelievable,"This book is totally amazing!! Marc Tedeschi is one of the most respected martial artists in the world. This book should be considered as a ""bible"" , if you would say, for any martial artist interested in Hapkido. There is so much information to help individuals grow and mature as a martial artist."
3,Very Interesting book but not Hapkido,"Mr. Tedeschi has written a wonderful book indeed. Although it contains material from Hapkido, the fact is, the book is an obvious compilation of information from many related styles including Wally Jay's Small Circle, Brazilian Jujitsu, Ming's Chin Na, Okinawan Kobudo, Dillman's Kyusho Jitsu, and many others. Well presented and impecable quality. Most martial artists will enjoy reading it. The author defends himself from this critic by arguing that in modern times most martial arts are undistinguishable from each other, this is not the truth. Trying to be as objective as possible , the book deserves a four or five stars. But what really becomes a big handycap is that the material presented here is not traditional or classical Hapkido. It is in fact general martial art."
4,Quite comprehensive and beautiful layout,"I find this book really interesting. At first (as said by many reviews) the size strikes you and once you start reading it, it's unlike any other martial arts books available. The details are amazing (althoug slightly bigger pictures would have been a great plus). I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this art. Nevertheless, I regret to see that few of the common techincs I have learned with my korean masters were present in the book ....... but this is certainly due to the richessnes of this art, and one sinlge book always seems to small to totally describe such a complete martial art."
1,Not Good!!,Boring and the Girl Dj in the back wasn't really playing records.. Just seem the setup was fake.. Dance moves wasn't that great!
1,Not much of a workout,Really not much of a workout at all. Very slow paced and very little aerobic stamina or strength required. Glad I only rented it.
3,Dancefloor Aerobics,Not as fun as I hoped it would be. My husband said it would be stupid and I bought it anyway and I have used it once! There are definately better dance work out routines.
2,Plastic that breaks,"Gaggia, Italian for ""plastic that breaks."" We've had this grinder for a few months and a piece of plastic broke off of the doser gear. Now it is extremely difficult to get the ground coffee out of the machine. We also have one of the Gaggia Espresso machines -- the steamer wand broke recently, also plastic. Otherwise, both machines have done a good job."
3,Not sure if I would order from them again,"This plant came very quickly, however it wasn't very healthy. 2 of the 4 plants I recieved have not made it. Not sure if I would order from them again!"
2,Nice but doesn't last very long,I got this coffee table a few years ago and loved it. Like other people have said it is a pain to put together but it's hard to get certain screws in. My biggest complaint is that I think a coffee table should last more than a couple of years. The paint job didn't even hold up a year. There are big junks of wood missing. A little excessive for everyday wear and tear. The drawers are falling apart and the bottom shelf broke off a year or two ago. My advice is not to buy this thinking it will be around for a long time.
4,Nice table for the money!,"I bought this for my family room/playroom, and after reading alot of the negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. It was fairly easy to assemble: I'm assembly-challenged and it took me about 30-40 minutes. Is quite sturdy/durable and looks more elegant/expensive than it really is. The drawers are a little shallow, but holds the remote controls & a couple magazines comfortablyMy only complaint is that during shipping, the packaging for the hardware opened, thus spreading all the nuts/bolts all over the box. Seems like one must've hit the top of the table and made a minor dent in it. There is a form for any replacement parts under 60 days, but since it's for my non-formal living room, I really don't think it's necessary for something so unnoticeable. I would recommend this if you need a nice coffee table for minimal money."
3,I would have rated this a 5 Star,"I received this product scratched on the table top. I love the table, but wish it wasn't sent with a big scratch on the top of it"
5,black table,"I was happy with the table and putting together was pretty easy too. The table is pretty heavy and solid - a pleasant surprise. The table works for the space - all measurements were accurate. I would recommend this table.Karen- Syracuse, NY"
4,Beautiful!,Beautiful Coffee Table for my small living room.Assemble was a little challenging but it was worthy every second spent on this project.I have received so many complements on the table.
4,Solid,"Table is nice enough, does have a few marks on it, maybe from shipping or maybe they all do. Sturdy and looks good in the room.I was a little disappointed the table was marked free shipping but I was charged."
4,coffee table - very nice!,"It's a small, functional little table. I love the two drawers for holding my remotes and other small stuff. The paint job isn't the greatest, but for $100 bucks it does the job. Putting it together was a snap (under 5 min). I thought about getting a children's toy box/bench, but opted for the table and I'm glad I did."
3,Good but not easy to assemble,"This is a good, solid table with real wood, but assembly is a pain. The top part is fully assembled, but putting on the legs is a finger-crunching ordeal that involves manually tightening bolts in a small, recessed space. Before installing the legs, be sure that the holes for the cams that hold the lower piece are facing in the right direction. The diagram and instructions do not help, and you may (as we did) find yourself removing and repositioning two of the legs. Fastening the lower piece involves tightening cam screws. It helps if the cam holes are drilled the right size; in our version, none were. Two were too large, and two were too tight (the cams had to be hammered in). This part of the installation is a two-person job because someone else must hold the main piece while the first two cams are tightened. We've assembled several pieces of prefab furniture with many more separate parts than this has, and this was one of the most difficult projects we've had."
2,"Nice style, but low quality materials","The table looks just like the photo and I really like the style of it. However it arrived with a few cracks in the wood - nothing really visible when assembled though, but I'm not sure how it will hold up over time. There's not much to the finish so I expect it to show scuffs and scratches quickly. I had intended to use it for a living room but have repurposed it for a basement room and will be looking for something else. If it would have been practical to return this I would have."
4,Don't Bother with the Tape...,"One book is never enough if you're trying to learn even a little Turkish! But phrase books are a good starting place, and this is a good little phrase book (though not my favorite) -- to carry around. It has a dictionary in the back, and is divided by category. Some seem a bit off -- in the socializing area there are invitations to go home with strangers (and a way to say no..but still...) Dining out, drinking, tourist areas, camping, even complaints are briefly covered.This book has details beyond what I hope I'll need in Turkey. Aside from the foods, it offers all the parts of an automobile (including a diagram of the inside of a car) and body parts (no diagram!).Interesting reading -- it has little bits of information that could be useful. Don't bother with the tape -- there are better ones offered (see other Turkish language book reviews!)"
3,Rather pedantic,"This may be the ultimate cat book for some but I didn't appreciate the overload of Frenchisms, and the dwelling on mistreatment of cats all through their history. It was an informative piece of work but I found it fairly rough going."
4,A nice-to-have filter,"This is a high quality filter and works nice for my 70-200L series lens. It is shipped with a nice cover which prevents the filter having any troubles while not mounted to the lens. And when the filter is mounted, it acts as a cover for the actual lens as well.As expected, when the filter is attached to the lens the image darkens a bit, so shutter speed tends to decrease. Thus I would suggest you to use a tripod if you have a lens without IS capability, as I do."
2,verdict still out on this ...,"Maybe I just don't get it. This Polarizer works differently from previous circular polarizers I have owned. Sometimes it works and the results are dramatic, however most of the time there is no polarization even though conditions dictate that there should be. It is advertised to work w/ a 24-105MM lens which is what it is attached to, however I still get vignetting at the 24mm setting. Expensive lens protector at this point."
5,b and w cir. plarizer wide angle slim filter,"This filter works great, but, it is hard to get off. The ribbed part to hold on to is so small. If you tighten it very much you can hardly get it off. Also it does not have clicks or numbers and it will move on you easily.You have to keep checking it that it has not turned without you knowing it. It works great but these other areas could easily be addressed. It was not cheap by any means. Are you listening B and W?"
2,Not what I expected...,"I was really excited to get my hands on a quality B+W filter to see what it could do compared to my 20+ year old Vivitar c-pol and man was I disappointed. Pictures look desaturated and the effect of the polarizer isn't right. Skies became more gray and reflections weren't reduced in the same fashion as before. Some colors shifted pretty badly in pictures. Overall I feel like this was a bad purchased and I'm looking for another filter. I bought the slim version to reduce vignetting, but not at the expense of picture quality."
5,A good slim filter,"I used to shoot with this filter for some years before on Canon EF-S 10-22 mm, but unfortunately I broke it. Very good saturated colours."
2,OK for those on a tight budget.,"Purchased this in hopes of not having to spend the hundreds for a better quality filter. Well end the end I ended up returning it. It was an OK filter, but I could see a strong polorization spot in a lot of the photos. This only happened with the wide angle zoom lens wide open. While that was kind of a pain, the most annoying part of this filter was definitely the cap. The cap does not stay on at all and I am still not sure why they even bothered including it in the package. Disappointed. If you can afford a better filter I would suggest looking at other models."
3,B+W thin 82mm. filter.,Like previous buyers have said because of the slim thickness of the filter the included lens cap won't stay on.
2,No cap for this filter !,"I can understand that this filter wont hold a common cap, lets say a Nikon original 72mm cap, because its very slim. But for me, the fact that the B&W cap that COMES WITH THE FILTER doesn't works neither is A FRAUD. What a joke !!! B&W must alert you for the fact that there's NO cap that holds on it. BIG desing mistake. Big shame. If you need a CPL for continous outdoor use, DONT BUY THIS SLIM CPL."
3,A good filter when it stays on the lens!,"I needed a ""Slim"" polarizing filter for ultra-wide lenses with 82mm diameter. I faced the following problems:1. The cap is useless and will fall off almost instantly2. The filter itself will pop-off the lens at least once a day... I tried to be extra careful and i have many filters and this is the only one with the problem. (BTW: I used it on a 10-20 mm / 3.5 Sigma..)3. For the price, I expected a nice pouch instead of the cheap bulky box!The positive:1. It is slim: Works well on an ultra-wide lens2. A polarizing filter that does the job3. Glass and frame look well built"
3,Good filter; non-functioning lens cap,"This filter does the job, and seems to have superior optics, but there are a couple of design problems:- Because it is so slim, it's hard to turn the rotating element without also turning the knurled area that screws/unscrews the filter. You have to remember to always turn the element clockwise (counter-clockwise from the shooter's point of view), i.e. in the tightening direction, to avoid unscrewing the filter.- As others have mentioned, this filter will not work with your existing lens cap, nor, astoundingly, does it work with the enclosed lens cap, which falls off at the slightest touch.If you can live with these problems, you'll enjoy this fine product."
3,mediocre,"How to choose? There are so many competing polarizing filters on the market. Some cost so little that I was suspicious. Some cost more than the camera on which I wanted to mount it - too much. I chose this one because of some name recognition and a mid-range price. I am disappointed. It does not filter glare nearly as well as the last one I had, years ago. It also seems ""spotty"" portions of the image have glare reduction and portions do not,"
5,Indispensble for teachers and students.,"At last. Shakespeare study notes that are really authoritative, accurate and enthusiastic. This new edition of Cliff's notes on Macbeth is outstanding. There are all the usual things that would be expected in notes of this type, but added to this is a real sensitivity in the appreciation of the language, and also an awareness of Macbeth as a play to be performed. it is perhaps this sensitivity that sets these notes apart. The author communicates a passion for the play by opening it up to everyone in the excellent scene-by-scene analysis. shakespare has never seemed so accessible, relevant and exciting. The suggested tasks are particulalrly inventive- a useful tool for teachers and students."
3,"Stainless, but wiper arm connector is plastic.","The wipers that I received are not exactly as pictured on Amazon. The included connector for the wiper arm is grey plastic, where the Amazon picture shows a metal connector. If not for that, I would have rated the wiper as 5 stars."
5,The very best of the QuickCam line!,"I was amazed at the ease of installation, and the high quality picture, and sound, that this unit delivers. This is easily the best of the QuickCam line. The conclusion of all the research that I did before I purchased this unit was that the Logitech QuickCam is the best webcam available, and the Ultravision is without a doubt the best of that line. The Ultravison is easy to install, easy to use (literally two clicks and you are online) and delivers a superior picture and sound, compared to others. The experience delivers nearly live sound and actual time video with nearly zero freeze-frameing, mosaic, or that irritating, under water-type sound you get from most webcams. Highly suggested for long-distance families, conference callers, or chatters!"
1,Crashes both my computers,I got this camera and installed it on both my Vista laptop and my XP desktop. Promptly crashed both systems. On the XP it was degenerative and corrupted the OS so I had to do a system restore. I can't believe Logitech released something so buggy!Despite of this camera's good looks and alleged performance buy and install at your peril.
1,Not usable on Vista,"Video on WinVista looks extremely dark and color balance is way off. It's safe to say a FAR or $5 webcam looks better. Logitech claims it's driver problem yet not a single solution has been released since Vista beta. Logitech, please at least finish alpha and beta test by yourself next time!3/6/2007 Update: To Logitech's credit, dark image problem has been fixed in the newest driver release. But color balance problem only gets slightly better. What's funny is now there's a new issue: whenever webcam is in use, CPU usage stays in 100% on a Sempron 3400+ machine!!! Again, Logitech probably doesn't bother with any alpha or beta test, they let you do it!"
5,Works great for Mac or PC right out of the box.,I bought this camera for my Intel MacPro that I also run XP on and it works great in either OS.
1,"Ultra Vision, comes in clear, but Rightlight fails","The camera resolution would be good if the Rightlight 2 didn't make the image so dark, even with lights on. I called Logitech but was on hold forever. When they gave me the option to leave a call back number, they never called back. I returned this product and got the Logitech Communicate CTX instead. Lower resolution, but it uses Rightlight 1 which actually seems to work. One would think if Rightlight 2 didn't work, they would not push that for any of their camcorders.But I would recommend avoiding any logitech cams that use Rightlight 2 until some one actually says they fixed the bug. Sometimes more expensive is not better."
2,Looking Good,My son finally got around to installing the webcam I got him. Picture and audio are good. Would definetly but another one.
1,Waste of money,"The camera itself looks nice though is a little bigger than you would expect. The problem is that the image is simply -- as noted many times below -- too dark to be usable. Now apparently this is a known logitech problem, but also apparently, logitech does not care enough to fix this problem on their flagship webcam.I purchased this camera because my wife is far far away for a few months, and I would really have liked to be able to see her once in a while. She's somewhere where there are no webcams to purchase. It's such a crappy picture, that we are not even bothering to webcam anymore. So I'm giving logitech two-three weeks, and if it's not fixed I will (a) file a Better Business Bureau complaint;(b) never buy anything from Logitech again; and (c) post this review everywhere possible on the internet.Go elsewhere."
3,King-size gaint with a mediocre performance,"Weighing it's price to performance, the Logitech QuckCam Ultra Vision delivers mediocre images with a right-light technology that doesn't make a difference. I would advice going for a creative labs or a less expensive webcam. An oversized-body and lousy images. The avatars special effects are fun in the beginning but you'll soon be irritated by its quality."
3,QuickCam,"This was not an easy install! It came without any installation instructions, or software (bought it used only to find out seller did not have these items and it was sent without anything). Software was downloaded from net but still took a whole day to make it work. Works fine once you find your way through the maze of installation. Not an item for users who are not techno proficient or who spend hours on the computer every day."
1,"After installation, I am unable to listen to any music on my computer","Installation time, it prompted me to check updates online and it installed the latest from web. During the web cam video and audio config time, it prompted me to stop all using the audio. After finishing the total installation, I am unable to listen to any music from CDs or online through the computer speakers.Anyone had this issue? Any thoughts on resolution.Logitech QuickCam Ultra Vision ( 961471-0403 )"
1,Crashed my pc,The software crashed my pc...this camera is useless to me. A huge waste of money. It took me four hours to back the software out and restore my PC. Be careful!
2,I returned this item,"I found the video quality not acceptable. I have a Sony camera from 7 years ago that works as well (as far as quality). The Logitech simply has more ""fun"" features."
4,Very Clear & Sharp Video Quality But...,"I have used 3 web cams, but this unit gives the clearest and sharpest video quality. The audio provided by this cam is clean, too. It works only with Windows, no driver for Linux. Check its dimensions before you buy so you won't be surprised. I think it's big to be used with a laptop. If you want the best picture and sound quality and don't care much about the size, then this is a good choice."
5,Good Camera especially for the price!,"I think this is a pretty good camera especially with the $60 rebate. Previously I had been using a lower resolution camera which was fine at the time. I wanted a better resolution camera so I could see my grandchildren better. Both my daughter and I bought this camera. We are both very happy with its performance. It does adjust to the lighting conditions fairly well and the sound is fine too.I am using it on a computer with XP Professional as the operating system and have not had any problems. On occasion it appears as though the picture is stuck in a freeze frame since you don't see anyone moving, but I think that is more a problem with Skype and the resources IT uses rather than the actual camera not working. All in all I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend it."
4,good image quality,"The only bad thing of the camera is its arm, which is not flexible enough to orientate the webcam where you would like it to be."
1,Stay away from this camera,"This is one of the worst pieces of junk I ever bought. Video quality is horrible. The setup messed my computer up, so it took me 3 days to clean it up and make it work again. Don't buy this cam unless you have money to waiste!"
2,Great Webcam; Problematic Drivers,"I have the QuickCam Ultra and several QuickCam Fusion webcams. The glass optics in the Ultra does give a better image than typical webcams but both the Ultra and Fusion webcams have been and are still crippled as a result of driver problems[...]If and when the driver issues are resolved, the glass optics, right light (low light) technology and echo canceling microphone technology of the Fusion Webcam will result in a superior webcam experience."
2,First disappointment from Logitech,"I have always loved to get the best piece of technology available on the market. Apart from the price, my purchases are greatly influenced by reviews given to products. I bought this cam as a replacement for my quickcam pro 4000 and am greatly disappointed since the image quality and clarity is no where near as good as that of my previous cam which happens to be at least 4 years older than this one. No amount of tweaking or driver updates have allowed me to get an image as defined and pronounced as i was able to with my previous logitech camera and to think this was more than twice as expensive as the quickcam pro 5000 which i now feel would have given me far better value for money.I would not recommend this camera to buyers who are serious about streaming image quality and I sure did not expect this from logitech whose products account for over 50% of extended arsenal of computer peripherals"
1,Avoid this camera,"Don't let the attractive specs of this camera lure you. This camera looks good on paper but will provide nothing but instability and mediocre image capturing.Logitech claims it is a software issue that causes poor and impossibly dark images, constant BSODs and hardware incompatibilities. Regardless, the camera simply does not work and should not have been released yet.I worked diligently troubleshooting but ultimately wasted many hours of my life on this paperweight. Do yourself a favor and buy another camera or wait till Logitech is kind enough to release stable drivers (hint. Don't hold your breath)Also avoid the forums if you are looking for support as they will offer one of two responses:""Repeat issue, search!"" or ""Try a clean install of the drivers""This product severely lowered my opinion of Logitech."
3,Poor Picture Quality,I am not sure if it is an incompatibility with my Mac or what? The picture quality is so poor!!!
5,Web Cam Marvel,"This is the best web cam for the money. Very clear pictures. I purchased this cam and got the rebate afterwards. After using the cam though, it's well worth the full retail price."
5,Plug and play with an iBook G3,"Works flawlessly with the iBook and iChat. No need to download any drivers, as OS 10.4.x recognizes the camera."
4,"I am never going near another plant, NEVER!","When I saw this movie I was shocked of how creepy it was. I'd have to say the creepest part was when the girls sneaks into the bathroom and sees her Dad cut open his skin and green blood came out, plant blood, then he makes his kids eat it! So this movie taught me a lesson... not to touch, look at, or go near a plant. YOU HAVE YO SEE THIS FILM!!!"
4,"Good movie, but not scary","I watched this movie and thought it had a good story, good acting, but it wasn't scary. Casey sounds like a girl. Anyway, the movie was good. I liked it when the worms were in their dads bed. I also liked the ending...oh, never mind. I recommend this movie, so buy it!"
2,stay out of the basement,it`s not scary at all!!! it`s real stupid and the actors are c.o.r.n.y.!it`s my least favorete from the goosebumps seris!the book is much better!this movie is stupid!
4,Good HD Action,"HD DVD delivers great audio and video on a harware/software package that is reasonably priced. I have both HD DVD and Blue Ray titles, about 6 Blue Ray and about 60 HD DVD. For good action flicks like this one that are fun to watch without expecting any Oscar winners, it's the only way to go for me."
2,Nicely choreographed.,"There are few reasons to watch this movie. Why don't you watch something historically based instead. I can think of one that takes place in a desert, for example, Lawrence of Arabia. That's a fine movie. yes, in fact, you should read the BOOK."
2,Borinng....zzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Many fans of ""The Mummy"" were rather thrilled by the shedding of some backround story on who the Scorpion King was, and many kind of figured it was going to be a greatly action packed and highly entertaining piece of film, very much like ""The Mummy"", mixing action, suspense, mystery, and humor into one very entertaining movie... well, to spell it out in plain english this downright [STINKS}.The DVD in itself is packed with many vignettes which would have been great, if only after watching the movie and being bored to death, you would have had the curiosity to see.A waste of time, hollywood moviemakers, you can do better!!By the way, I gave it two stars because of the supplemental material."
4,Great movie,"This is the 3rd movie from the Mummy series.If you like Dwayne Johnson(The Rock)you'll lovethis movie.The rock does his own stunts and youcan see some of his wrestling moves when he fightsall the bad guys.Although I think this one is notas good as the first 2 Mummy movies because it'smore about the Scorpion King.The special effects are cool andthey have some good battle scenes,so overallI'd say this one is a good movie.If you loveAction,Romance and special effects,The ScorpionKing is a must see and own."
3,lame,"I thought the movie was really cheesy. The movie was not anythingcompared to the ""The Mummy"" or the ""The Mummy Returns"". I thoughtthat this movie would have more adventure and it did not.Therewere a few good parts, however the all around movie was not thatgreat and I was not impressed."
3,Movie Version of the WWE,The Scorpion King was a lot of fun. Every scene was so over-the-top outrageous that I spent most of my time laughing. The Rock is a credible leading man (hot! hot! hot!) with a trusted steed (camel). The female lead is a beautiful woman with magical powers. There's a good guy and a bad guy. The correct formula for entertainment.
3,Run of the Mill Action Flick but The Rock Oozes Potential,"There are no more action heros. Really. Arnold is washed-up. Stallone is making straight to video movies. The Rock oozes with potential to be the next great action hero. The Scorpion King is nothing more than a showcase for The Rock's vast talents. He is not just muscle-bound but witty and even downright funny in many scenes. This guy has got charisma and style, now he just needs the substance. The Scorpion King is filled with almost every tired action film cliche yet The Rock still carries this film on his back to respectibility. Just think, this is his 1st starring role...the potential is unlimited. As for The Scorpion King, the action scenes are good except for the last battle scene and the sandstorm scene which are great. Overall, this is entertaining mindless fun for action buffs or wrestling fans. Recommended."
4,Wonderfully Campy!,"I was surprised at how fun this movie is!The Rock is very easy to look at and the guys will dig Kelly Hu's ""almost there"" costumes! There's great action and things move along at a galloping pace.One of the surprise delights is Bernard Hill (from LORD OF THE RINGS) who plays a somewhat bumbling but brilliant scientist in the employ of the Big Baddie (but another piece of handsome, talented eye candy) Steven Brand. Add Michael Duncan Clark (with his wonderfully resonant voice)to the mix and there's something for everyone!The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) doesn't take himself to seriously and he's a disarmingly charming hero.Not as good as THE MUMMY, but still great fun for all! A bit too violent for wee ones but I'd let a ten year old to see it.I'd sure love to see the outtakes for this movie as it looks like it was fun to make!"
4,Conan Returns!,"As the review pasted on the cover's front panel written by UPN-TV, ""Non-stop, rock-solid action!"" It is essentially a return to the fun days of Conan the Barbarian and incorporates numerous action sequences to bring forth the plot of stopping the world's greatest swordsman from further dominanting the earth. As the savage tribes fall one by one to this conquering enemy, they hire a small team of assassins led by The Rock, to exterminate the swordsman. Due to a betrayal, he turns the table and The Rock is suddenly thrust alone to confront the enemy. Alone that is, until he steals away the swordsman's ace, the Sorceress. All-in-all, a fun movie, light on plot, heavy on action."
1,very disappointing,"We loved the Mummy and Mummy Returns movies and hoped that this DVD would provide the same well rounded entertainment. Unfortunately, all the movie does is provide a vehicle for the Rock to exhibit his fighting abilities."
3,"Good Acting,Good Casting,but to historicly fiction","Its kinda hard to see this as pre-qual to The Mummy...Pretty good set was used if not the real thing, to re-create an anciat egyption city but it does look to me that they hired bodybuilders and pornstars to repesent the guards and the egyption ladies just to save a few bucks.Alough this copy the useal action/fighting ending fight seqenceWitch is Boss vs. Boss and 1 Army vs. a nother Army, good guy almost loseing but good guy getting the big finish...All in All it could have been better,,, but its someting that kinda gets old after a few times."
1,TERRIBLE,"What do you really expect from a movie that was made for a non-actor? Remember that old chant? ""Rocky s**ks"" He most certainly does in this movie."
1,"this is not Mummy 3, theres no Imoteph, it's a spin off","this movie is not good, at all, I want Mummy 3, not a wrestler starring spin off, this isn't Mummy 3 simply because theres no Mummy, no Rick O' Connell, it's just a bad spin off"
1,One Of This Year's Worst Films,"This film is straight up boring.I found myself waiting and hoping for something exciting to happen.There is a major lack of action and entertainment in this film.Relying on the Rock's popularity alone is not enough to make this film a hit or at least decent.Why couldn't the Rock try to stay away from playing his wrestling character in this movie.All that was missing is the wrestling ring in the desert.The film has nothing to do with The mummy.The film does not provide the great special effects of The Mummy & Mummy Returns.Why did this movie have to be made?This movie does not have what it takes to be as successfu as Arnold's Conan movies.No imagination and nothing exciting, fresh or new with this one.Just a plain boring movie with an over hyped star..."
2,well......,"If you like the Rock's body then there are scenes in the movie you will surly enjoy, but it definatly does not come close to the movies that it is actually a dirivative of (The Mummy & The Mummy Returns).Honestly, it is not worth buying in new condition. I'm glad I only rented it."
3,Great Action! A step above Mummy Returns,"Less plot , more action , the way any movie starring a WWF wrestler should be. If you are into people getting sliced up,and arrows stuck in their chest you will adore the ScorpionKing. Rated PG-13. - Michael Margetis"
1,Talk about a stinker,"I have kept watching this movie to see just how bad it gets.The writing is bad, the costumes are bad, the story is bad."
2,"Has NOTHING to do with ""The Mummy"" series","Don't get me wrong, I was fully prepared (and excited) for a brainless 90 min of historically bogus fantasy/adventure. But Scorpion King isn't really a movie. I've forgotten the basic plot already and really don't care (which is normally ok if there's good special effects and a little more money thrown at the movie). But in this case, it borderlines low budget and isn't really interesting at all. It's pretty clear they spent INFINITELY more money on advertising and cable specials featuring ""the rock"" than they did on production. The extra star is for the attempt, and somewhat bearable acting. But honestly, you will miss NOTHING."
1,I'd rather be stung by a scorpion than watch this again.,"This flick was a total waste of my time. Its rare I tell someone to pass on a movie, because, afterall, everyone has different tastes. Pass on this movie. While I enjoyed 'The Mummy' and was fine with 'The Mummy Returns' even with its train wreck on an ending, this movie feels like a low-budget attempt to cash in on its predecessors' success. The Rock was okay in the movie (think Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan) and I'm willing to watch his future attempts, but hopefully he will choose less lame movies or he'll go the way of Van Damme."
3,Rock was cool !!,"I really enjoyed ""The Scorpion King"". It was entertaining, adventorous with a little romance mix into it. It was funny and full of little punch lines that made it a bit more interesting and kept you on your feet.It did feel a bit short to me as well as having certain points that were not as cleared as they should have been.But overall, I think that the movie was worth my admission $$. I think that if they had a sequel to this movie, I would definately pay to see it. I think I'll see it again!"
1,Scorpion King is awful,"Even if you cannot ""smell what the Rock is cooking"" you can smell this very poorly made movie. The WWF does not translate well to ancient Egypt and this film is little more than WWF in costume. The fights were all WWF, sans metal chairs. The longer the movie ran, the more accutely aware I was that the star of the movie is named ""Dwayne"" because even his charisma of the ring falls away in the face of his terrible acting. ""Acting"" here means squint-eyed stare with mouth closed OR wide-eyed stare with mouth open. Do not confuse this movie with the two Mummy films. It's just a poorly done rip-off."
2,This movie [stunk],"The acting was bad, the plot was horrible, the action was horrendous, and it was just trying to be another remake of Conan the Barbarian. Save your money and buy Conan the Barbarian instead if you want some sword/dagger action.I am only giving this moive 2 stars because of the girl, who is HOT."
5,If Ya Smellllllll What the ROCK......is coookin!!!,"This movie was really good. It would have still been good without the Rock, but the Rock definitely made it a whole lot better. This is a five star because of the rock otherwise it would have been a four star. The Rock does a very good job acting and fighting in this movie. It is a must buy whether you are a wrestling fan or not. I just wish the movie would have been about 10 to 15 minutes longer with a little bit more of a Previous story-line. But I'm going to buy this when it comes out and I suggest most people do too!"
5,The Scorpion King is GOOD!,"Please don't whack this movie with your critics.It is first major role for The Rock.And I think he done it well.The Scorpion King won't be a mega hit like Spidermanwhich open few days ago but it is good own its own way.Unlike The Spiderman which had CGI for 80% of the whole film,Scorpion King only had little of it. It was more physical.The Rock's next movie is Helldorado by Universal and I hopeit provide him with more acting range."
3,Hehe.... no surprise,"What else can you expect from a movie starring then rock? Well, impossible fights, funny scenes, good special effects, and... huh.. the rock. There are no surprises about this, it doesn't really tell a story, the movie greatest scenes are when the rock is fighting, and he's fightin almost all the time. The bad thing about this movie is the story ( i was not expecting a good story, but i cant give 4 or 5 stars for a movie with a dumb story).. But it's worth to weatch it."
3,"Not as good as Mummy, but it had a little something","I am not a WWF fan, nor a big The Mummy fan, but this movie had a little something. Like Vin Diesel, The Rock isn't the best actor in the world, but he's got something -I guess you could call it screen presence. Whatever it is, it shined in this movie. He had only like 15 lines of dialogue (there's not much in the entire movie) and most of those were delivered like a rock tossed in a puddle of mud. (pun intended, friends!)The story was what you'd expect. Fun was had by all. When you watch the DVD, make certain you watch the outtakes. They add a significantly different twist to the story that I think should have been left in. Apparently The Rock's character was some sort of pawn in a prophecy, but all references were cut from the movie. Draw your own conclusions. I thought it would have added a little depth to the story.Definetly worth a rental. Go get it!"
4,For THE ROCK fans!,"If you are a WWE THEROCK fan, go rush to get this. I am 100% sure you will like it. My 7 year old brother is a THEROCK fan, and he liked it too. Those of you who don't know THEROCK or don't like him, might not like the movie. But if I were not a THEROCK fan, I would still have liked it."
4,"Scorpion King,very entertaining movie","Went and saw The Scorpion King, movie was VERY entertaining!!! The Rock's acting ability was you know pretty good for a guy in his first ever major role. I was afraid that ""SK"" was going to be like the forgettable Arnie flick ""Conan The Destroyer""....""SK"" did not even come close. Kelly Hu was amazing too also!! Not bad for a girl..ahem! I mean Female Actress from Hawaii!!! The full length of 2 hours was worth every minute!!!"
4,What do you expect,I like movies that depict a time other than our own and realism is not necessary. I liked this movie because I got what I expected and when it was over I was satisfied.
2,I crown thee......a dud.,"There was obviously a lot put into this movie to try and make it a blockbuster, money, resources, etc., but the thing that hurts this movie the most is The Rocks' inability to act. I know he's popular, and very charismatic, but these qualities will only get you so far, and I think he was in way over his head. In the sequel to The Mummy, we saw him for a brief time and he had little or no dialogue, and it worked. Here, I just had a hard time believing that he was the character he was trying to play, and not just some professional wrestler transplanted into role that demanded more acting ability. There were some exciting parts in the movie, but overall I just got really bored. If you really want to see an excellent movie of this genre, go get Conan the Barbarian. This one is pretty much a stinkeroo, albeit a slick and glossy stinkeroo. This is one of those movies I wished I would have rented it before buying it, but I guess I got suckered in by all the hype.."
1,Simply awful,"Now don't get me wrong - I like the Rock. I thought he was terrific in the cameo that he had in The Mummy Returns; way better than the CGI scorpion at the end of the film. His Saturday Night Live episode is one of my favorites. This foray into entertainment, though, should have been left in its entirety on the cutting room floor. The story is completely predictable and trite. There is nothing lovable about the character; there are no higher values explored than an undying need for revenge and there is no subplot of any real interest. Arnold did it better in Conan, without digital effects. Read elsewhere the plot if you must, but I am sure you can already predict the story line. Don't bother buying it new, for I am sure you will find plenty of used copies at bargain prices. The very worst thing about this is that there is probably already a sequel planned."
1,Terrible B-movie,"The first few minutes set the tone. In the opening scene, the Rock shoots someone with an arrow, and they fly out of the room like they were hit with a scud missile. This movie is similar to the early hercules B-movies. A bunch of people running around in loin cloths, lots of exotic unrealistic weapons and no plot. If you enjoy campy muscle flicks, get a Conan movie, they are much better than this advertisement for the Rock."
1,Would give this movie a negative rating if possible,"The Mummy and the Mummy Returns, both excellent movies should not be associated with this movie. Scorpion King is a movie which I by mistake bought, I would not consider to watch this movie again, not even if they paid me to do it. Dwayne Johnson should stick to WWF, destroying one movie is hopefully enough."
1,The Scorpion King (Widescreen Collector's Edition),"What, no partial stars?How could they mess up this simple combination? Make an ancient style action movie with the rock. I don't know, but they did. You'll be able to tell that it's really bad in the first 5 minutes of the movie, but by then it's too late. The only thing I found entertaining about this movie was the Rock's commentary with easter eggs. While not exact, this typical: The Rock: ""This is my favorite scene"" very very long silence... ""It was 3 in the morning when this scene was shot"" very very long silence, etc... Click on an scene easter egg(a scorpion in this case), and a small screen with the Rock wearing headphones pops up and you get to see him saying lines like the ones I just listed.What a waste of money, theirs, not mine. Thankfully it was a free rental for me.I suggest a target audience of no higher than young teen, but then you should screen the film first for violence."
3,You're Not My Mummy!,"After the first two Mummy movies, this one just doesn't exactly feel like it belongs entirely. Not only because it is set thousands of years ago, but it just feels much more mundane. In the Mummy movies, the villain had some quite fantastic powers. In comparison, this one feels like there's barely any mysticism in it at all.Going in, you'd think the movie would largely feature the event shown in The Mummy Returns where the Scorpion King makes his deal with the devil, so to speak. But that doesn't come into play at all. It's much more of a run-of-the-mill action movie set in ancient Egypt.The performance from Dwayne Johnson is weak (see the Rundown for something where he actually does a much better job) but it's not necessarily terrible.All in all, the movie simply ends up being a bit of a let-down."
3,The Scorpion King,"The Scorpion King is a pretty entertaining movie with good special effects. It doesn't take a lot of concentration to watch it so you can relax and just enjoy the movie. Of ""The Mummy"" series the Scorpion King is not my favorite. The original is still the best."
3,A good entertainment for a rainy afternoon!,"""Scorpion King"" picks up and maintains faithfully the basic structure of the epic tale, but constructed with a smart dose of acidic humour and double sense vignettes. There are common places and stereotypes like the smart young boy and the unerring and opportunistic ""fool"", the beauty protagonist, the brutal villain. There are also, marvellous action sequences - specially the great explosive final - that makes it worth to watch it."
2,Forgettable Movie.,"It has violence, more than action. The storyline is poor and unoriginal. The acting is generally speaking nominal. Two-Stars does it."
1,a sad dissapointment,"I really enjoyed the Mummy, and thought the Mummy Returns was at least an entertaining diversion. The Scorpion King however, no where lives up to expectations. There was no plot to speak of, just a lot of beefcake and T & A. The Rock seemed unwilling to part his lines, the sorceres was dull witted and sad, and the villians were not at all villanious. they wanted to be all powerful, oh wait, isn't that what the scorpion king wanted in the last film? My advice? Skip this movie. Save your [money], and your 2 hours."
4,Scorpion King Rocks!!,"Great action shots, mixed with well placed humor. An excellent addition to anyone's collection that has already purchased Mummy and Mummy Returns. Writer does a good job of keeping you wondering the end result. Don't believe the pre-movie reviews. Go see for yourself and enjoy."
3,"Good, but not THAT good","The Scorpion King is a spinoff of the Mummy and the Mummy returns movies. It stars the Rock as Matthias, an assassin for hire who has a personal score to settle with the typical bad guy. Along the way there's the girl, the comic sidekick, the rival turned ally, the climactic final battle...well, you get the picture.Okay, so there's nothing that original here, but the Rock actually does a pretty good job of acting. Also, there's his buddy Balthazar, played by Michael Clark Duncan (you know, that REALLY big guy from Armageddon and The Green Mile). Besides the acting, the special effects are really cool, and the fight scenes are very exciting.The downside is simply that it's nothing new. It's all been done before, but hey, we won't hold that against the Rock. All in all, it's a movie worth seeing, but maybe not worth owning."
3,*Please note*,Please note - Amazon's description of the extras is for the standard DVD. The blu-ray's only special feature is the Director's commentary. Still great fun but if you want the behind the scenes extras you need to buy the standard DVD.
3,Muscle action goes all out,"What can I say? This is just pure muscle fantasy. If you can get past the point that the villian of The Mummy Returns is now a hero (how did that happen?), they you can deal wit any of the other ridiculous things that happen in this movie. Acting aside, there are several well choreographed action scenes which will make this a must have for action fans. If you're the kind of person who enjoyed the Conan movies, then you'll love this because it's Conan plus real special effects! It'll be right up your alley. This movie isn't going to win any awards, but you'll have fun watching it."
3,Bad Acting By Cast Members!,"""The Rock"" can't act! Some of the other characters weren't that great either in terms of their acting abilities, but ""The Rock"" was the worst offender. Basically, this is my only gripe with this film--- Poor acting performances by the cast!Otherwise, the action, stunts, costuming, make-up, special effects/computer graphics and storyline were all fine."
3,Conan wannabe,"Mathayus the Akkadian (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson)defeats a powerful warlord (Steven Brand) and rescues a beautiful sorceress (Kelly Hu) in this Conan-lite adventure. The Rock showed that he had the presence to carry a film, but the story is ridden with cliches and the narrative is strewn with coincidence. There is always a handy escape route when the Rock needs it, and he always encounters unexpected comrades when they are required. Brand is miscast as the warlord; he is not physically imposing and never quite seems like a match for Johnson. The only things that raise this film (barely) to the 3-star level are the Rock's charisma and some decent action scenes."
5,THE ROCK IS THE SCORPION KING-THE GREAT ONE,"As a huge fan of the WWE I have watched the Career of the Outstanding athlete Dwayne Johnson. His performance in ""The Scorpion King"" was not only exciting but and excellent performance for his first time in a feature film. Dwayne Johnson is a man of war. He battled his way into the movie goers of America and all over the world. He is not to be considered the next ""Arnold"" but the next Action Hero with 3rd generation superstar status. His ability to capture your attention on the screen not just with his being a sex symbol but with his talent is amazing. I hope his career flourishes and they (the film industry) realizes how marketable ""The Rock"" can be. I am anticipating his next movie. Two thumbs up from his #1 fan."
2,"""Conan the Barbarian"" Re-do","If you liked Conan the Barbarian with Arnold back in the 1970's you will like this movie. No real story line, lots of violence and an actor who has a long way to go (Sorry, Rock)."
4,It was fun! Go see this movie!,"Hey, this movie was pretty good. I thought I was going to hate it! The Rock is a decent actor--he would have to be, given he was/is a professional wrestler. Kelly Hu was FABULOUS in her role as the sorceror.It may not be an instant classic, but honestly, it's a fun movie. It's colorful, slightly predictable, and a real romp. As far as ""date movies"" go, this one would be great for most couples. It's got action, suspense, romance, and mystery. In short, it's campy but good clean fun.If you want to see a FUN movie, see ""The Scorpion King""! (And forgive the ""reviewers"" who haven't seen the film. They honestly don't know what they'll be missing.)"
2,ughhh,"I remember seeing this Up North with my cousin. I asked him if it was like The Mummy series and didn't get a straight answer. He knows I like the Mumy and the Mummy returns. So I sat through a boring 2 hour movie for a movie that has no relation to The Mummy what so ever. I mean, he isn't even the KING in it! He's merely a warrior and doesn't become king until the end. The setting isn't in egypt, its in something like Pakistan or something! There is no mention of the dog like creatures that he ends up controlling. NONE OF THAT!!!! All it is is The Rock swinging a sword around. No relation to the Mummy movies at all. I wouldn't even reccomend this one to fans. Stick with the other two movies.Why is it called the scorpion king if there is no KING?"
1,Mirza Memic,"The following text is written in swedish!Hall! Jag tycker att ""Klippan"" är en kt fan. Han borde ha spelat med i min favoritfilm, ""Ridskolan"", och kört trekant med Tjejen med ridhjälmen och Drängen med hästkuken.Som skdis är han dock i klass med Göran ""Vänster"" Eurenius."
1,WARNING:BAD MOVIE,"The Rock is great on WWE wrestling, but he is not ""The Great One"" in this movie. I was very disapointed by this bad movie. I expected that is was going to be good. It turned out to be very cartoonish. When one of the bad guys is hit with an arrow, their bodies fly backwards as if they were hit with a shotgun. How is an arrow able to propel someone's body into the air ? I also must complain about the special effects. The special effects are very poor. I expected great special effects like what I saw in The Mummy Returns.If you want to get a movie with The Rock, then buy The Mummy Returns instead. The Scorpion King should be erased from all movie history. It should have been produced as a one hour TV special, like Zena or Herculees."
1,Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!,"Don't get me wrong, I was really anticipating this movie's release back in the spring of 2002, but boy, was i disappointed. I was expecting something along the lines of The Mummy Returns, but what I got was literally the worst movie ever made. The plot (if it even exists) seems like it was written by a drunk 7-year-old who just escaped from the loony bin.I'v seen a lot of really bad movies, but none have surpassed this in shear stupidity. Those made-for-TV movies on the SciFi chanel are at least fun. This isn't.Anyone in their right mind would do well to stear clear of this donkey fecies. If you do end up watching it, just remember to keep a good ol' propane tank handy. You might want to down it halfway through."
5,The Return Of The Kings,The movie is cool.I watch it twice already.Stunning choreography.Dwayne Johnson had a VERY good acting.He even got his first on screen kiss with Kelly Hu. This way better than Harry Potter.
1,NO COMMENT,"AS I LIVE IN EUROPE, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH THIS BLU RAY DVD.THE FORMAT WAS NORMALLY ""ALL REGIONS"" BUT I GUESS THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE WITH A REGION 1 APPARATUS COULD WATCH IT. SO I SPENT MY MONEY FOR NOTHING. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I WANTED TO SEND IT BACK TO AMAZON BUT FINALLY I CHANGED MY MIND BECAUSE I WOULD I HAVE LOST MONEY.SO I'LL NEVER PURCHASE THIS KIND OF DVD AGAIN."
2,Not the best but nice for people living in the area,It was not made by Professional but it is interesting if you live in this state.
4,an important milestone in metal history,"For those interested in the history of metal this album is a must. It can truly put in a plausible claim to be the first melodic death metal album ever, coming in 1992 before ""Heartwork,"" ""Lunar Strain,"" or ""Skydancer"" was released (Carcass, In Flames, & Dark Tranquillity, respectively).I have added an additional star because of the album's place in history; a more precise grading might be 7.5 out of 10. Amorphis at this stage was to a large degree stuck in deathgrind conventions. This is an extremely heavy, grinding album, leaving the listener almost too shellshocked to appreciate the subtler moments. The vocals are extremely gruff even by death-metal standards. Even after owning the CD for years, most of the songs run together, with only a few superb moments shining through the general haze.Melodic death metal fans should definitely get this, but don't expect a masterpiece."
4,Amazing music,"Amorphis members were teenagers (16-18 years) in this record, that is something that emphasizes the greatness of the music.Guitarists are greater than many adult guitarists, they are simply amazing. This record is a great part of the history of the evolution of black metal, a must-have."
4,early example of a new school of death metal,"I hate to use the oxymoronic term ""melodic death metal"", but that's the best way to describe stuff like this. A distinctly European sound that combines the low-tuned grind of death metal with the more melodic aspects of traditional metal like Iron Maiden. Most bands doing a job of this stuff are coming out of Sweden or Finland (where Amorphis hails from), and the style is pretty much unknown to most of America. Anyways, this is a good early example of the form, Amorphis being one of the first bands to actualize this style."
4,Death Metal debut,"The debut release from Amorphis is pure death metal. This band has evolved into a mass of talent and style changes, but this release has them at the roots of brutality!"
2,Disappointed,"I found the game boring. So, did my 4 year old nephew. I thought it would be better than it was because my niece has the scene it jr. game.The numbers were called too slow. I did not like how stiff and unanimated it seemed. The sound quality was not the best either. Great concept but it could have been a lot better."
3,Not as entertaining as I'd like...,"My kids have LOTS of games, and this isn't one they pull from the pile to play very often. It's okay."
4,Disney DVD Bingo,"We got it 6 months ago. At first the whole family played the game a lot. Every day, 3 times in a row. Now not so much. I guess maybe 2-3 time a month.It's educational. It teaches the kids to listen to the numbers, to see them and to find the numbers. It teaches the colors and the children have the opportunity to learn the names of the Disney characters.The only down side is that the chips are very small and it is easy to loose them. But... We like it!It's been over a year since my last review of this product. We don't play it as often but my boy who is 5 years old still wants to play it especially when he has his friends over. The only problem is the chips. My second child (almost 2 years old) loves them to put in her mouth or to scatter them around."
2,Poor condition,Game was in poor used condition when I received it. When purchasing the product I received no warning of this.
4,Wide elastic belt,"Promptly received this belt. Quality was much better than expected for the price paid. Leather rosette adds a special touch. Even though I purchased for part of a costume for my chorus, I will be able to use it for everyday use as well."
5,A MUST HAVE,"All the songs on this EP are great, but what REALLY makes the CD worth it is the song, ""F-117."" It's the kind of track you don't expect to be put on a silly EP. It's fast, loud, and INTENSE. EBM-industrial at its greatest. You MUST buy this CD."
4,A Sensible Comedy,"I didn't expect much from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. Some classify it as a sex comedy, but at its heart it really isn't any such thing. Yes, there are a couple of semi-nude scenes, but they really aren't central to the story. Instead, this is a story about the anxiety of losing one's diary. In this case, it isn't a social life diary, but an intellectual life diary. All kinds of comical situations arise when Bickford's precious book is stolen by a young vixen, then lost by her boyfriend. It is a pleasant surprise to watch a movie where one's intellect, as expressed in 'the book,' is admired by all who come into contact with this unusual diary. There is a bit of coarse language, but not as much as is usual in these type of comedies. Also, the laughs do not arise out of slapstick drivel, but out of the unexpected logical outcome of its setup."
1,Problem,"Stupidly,I bought this dvd,without realising it only plays American,so I can't watch it,in future,i'll make damn sure I ONLY buy the dvd I CAN WATCH?"
5,the best sci fi concept ever!,"OK , let me give it to you plain and simple.This is the best science fiction concept EVER!!! But wait, there's more! This book trancends the label of "" science fiction"". It is also part biography , part history novel, part adventure, part damn good read!Critics of the book mainly get all caught up in the fact that the writing is perhaps not as brilliant in a literary way as the great authors. But you need to give Farmer a bit of leeway here.The great authors could never have come up with a concept like this, and sustain the excitement throughout the novel. It is also very well researched and he brings characters like Sir Richard Francis Burton and Alice Hargreaves back to life. The concept is also so incredibly grand and breathtaking, that it would really take 20 books to do it justice, so Farmer is doing the best he can in one short book, and the trade off is that the pace just keeps you on the edge of your seat.Do yourself a favour and read this book!!!"
3,"weird, very weird","This book to me so far is a little strange considering the events that take place. At first the character is spinning on a rod around a whole bunch of naked dead people and he is trying to grab another rod. Once he does, it gets even weirder. All of a sudden he is in a seperate place. Kind of like another world, but it is part of the after life. He then meets a tall scary alien like guy who talks to him and things start getting a little more understandable. Once it picks up with the dialogue between these two, the book becomes easier to comprehend and I kind of like the book. Once I finish it I am sure that I will have a better understanding for what the author was aiming for with this novel. I think that Farmer did a great job with making the reader think when they read it by making up things that are a little odd from normal everyday life. I like it"
5,Liberating!,It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a book like I did this one. I can hardly wait to read the other books in the series.
2,Mediocrity Redux,"Having read the series as a kid, I recently decided to revisit Riverworld while trapped in an airportI'd forgotten how bad these books truly are. A fascinating idea explored for one volume, beaten into the ground for another three, culminating in warren of rabbits more dumped than pulled out of various moth-eaten hats.Like the Riverworld itself, the series goes round and round, back and forth, on a very long trip to nowhere terribly interesting. The stultifying writing accumulates like silt. Not so much classic as dated."
4,Almost but not quite,"When Sir Richard died he thought that it was all she wrote. He could not have been more wrong, he had been resurrected on a giant river with most of the rest of humanity. It's a whole new world, so he decides to go up to the source of the river and find out hw had restored them all to life. This was the guy after all who snuck into Meca and got out alive, why should a river 200 million miles long populated by every bad(or good) person in history prove to be any obstacle?Overall-I think that the book is great, though I don't know if I could acuratly describe it as science fiction. The book is wonderful but it has a lot of extra information that takes away from the overall force of the story..."
2,Not as good as it's cracked up to be..,"This book certainly was not the thrill I had once expected it to be. It ended up being tedious after the first 30 pages or so. The beginning was superb. It seems, however, that Farmer gave up after a while, and just slacked off. However, he made 5 other books after the fact...?Personally, I just didn't think it was that great."
5,pretty good set of journal articles,"There are many dimensions to the transport of people across international borders. Global Human Smuggling provide a historical and contemporary look at the topic. They start with the traffic of sex slaves in the late 1800s and early 1900s. They focus on topics such as asylum seekers, ill-legal immigration to America from Mexico and Asia. The book also deals with the topics of organized crime. Russian, Chinese and Mexican organized crime units have played parts in transporting humans from one country to anotuehr. The book also deals with the political impact of smuggling people across borders. Countries such as Japan and the United States have been cracking down the use of illegal aliens and both countries have seen xenophobia saying that foreigners are responsible for crime and lowering native wages."
5,Doing RCIA? This is your book!,"I finally decided to convert to Catholicism after a life long search in other faiths. I began RCIA classes in September and waited for a text to be assigned but there was no text. I was drowning in bits and pieces of information with nothing to guide my path. So I bought this book. BINGO! Or should I say AMEN! This book has enlightened me on any topic imaginable about Catholicism. It is plain and simple and positive. There is no way it will be over anyone's head. I have strongly recommended it to my convert friends as well as my Cradle Catholic friends. If you are beginning your search or have been a life-long Catholic but don't really know much about your faith, purchase Catholicism for Dummies. It will enlighten you!"
4,Great book for understanding Catholicism,"For perspective I am not, have never been and will never be Catholic, but have many Catholic friends and relatives. I wanted to be more knowledgeable of their faith and this book has been a tremendous help! It will help you understand where people of the Catholic faith are coming from and the expectations of the Catholic Church. It is well-written by two priests with a sense of humor and obvious love for their faith. They compare and contrast some of the Protestant/Catholic beliefs on various subjects without name calling or finger pointing, and even acknowledge some of the past sins of the Catholic church. (and rightly so the Protestants and Moslems!) A very light but thorough read and very enlightening to the noncatholic."
5,Excellent read for new convert,"Very well written, well organized and highly informative book. I highly recommend it for those seeking a place in the Church.The title, however, appears a bit insulting, so you may not want to carry it to Mass :-)"
4,Informative for someone unfamiliar with Catholicism.,"I will first say that I am not Catholic. I know basic religious history, but the details regarding Catholicism in practice are hazy at best. I found the book to be informative and educational. There is so much information here that I will go back to it periodically, more like a reference book than a straight-through read. Sorry about the brevity of this review, but I find myself not having much to say on the subject. Overall, good book for explaining Catholicism to others."
5,Excellent Resource,Extremely helpful and thorough resource. I find myself referring back to the book often for clarification of terms and concepts. Very clearly written and easy to understand which is remarkable for such a complex topic.
5,Everything you always wanted to know...,"I saw my first ""Catholicism for Dummies"" in our RCIA library and promptly bought my own. I find it concise, funny, easy to read and understand, and very entertaining, as well as knowledgable. A must for every household. I've since bought 5 others as gifts for friends. They also make perfect gifts and study aids for any RCIA program. Thanks to Fr. John and his associates!"
1,Flawed,"I have just looked at the sample pages, specifically P. 14, where it is written: ""Catholics are taught that all men and women are made in the image and likeness of God and that all men and women have been saved by Christ and are adopted children of God."" That is not what the Church teaches. The Church teaches that salvation is offered to all men, and that it is up to each individual to embrace it or not. I also noticed that, in these pages, it mentioned the 10 Commandments and the natural moral law but made no reference to Christ's moral teachings which make much greater demands on one and distinguishes Christian behavior. The 10 Commandments and natural moral law oblige everyone, not just Christians. Christians are called to holiness which means ""putting on the mind of Christ"" and trying to follow Christ's words in the sermon on the mount."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book with a genuine interest in Catholicism but found the blunt dishonesty about the parts I know (e.g. English history) put me off believing the rest of the book. e.g. top page 379 states that ""1829 was the first time since Henry VIII that freedom of worship was allowed for Roman Catholics"" but in between these dates there was actually obligatory Catholicism under a particularly nasty Roman Catholic queen (called ""Bloody Mary"": she martyred many for their faith).As far as I am aware Bloody Mary completely reversed the schism of the Anglican communion and the current schism dates to Elizabeth I. That doesn't mean the schism was right or valid but pretending it was down to a dodgy king (Henry VIII) when it was actually partly caused as a backlash to a particularly nasty loyal Roman Catholic queen makes me inclined to believe the rest of the book is a pack of lies too.Yours in deep disappointment"
5,Don't Be Fooled by the Title,"Catholicism for Dummies, like the rest of the ""Dummies"" series makes understanding the subject easy, in this case, Catholicism clear and easy. It is one of the best purchases that I have made at Amazon.com. Whether you want to know what Catholics mean by ""holy water"" or ""Hypostatic Union"", ""Tabernacle"" or ""Transubstantiation"" it's there. If you want to know what the difference between the influence of Plato or Aristotle was on Thomas Aquinas' philosophy, it's there. This is one great little book. It is as easy to read as the newspaper."
4,Great info,Great book with great information. It was recommended to me by a Catholic that new I needed to get up to speed on Catholicism quickly.
3,It does what it was intended to do,"This book was pretty much as expected. It gives an overview of Catholicism, with brief introductions of beliefs and customs. Don't expect any depth here or serious explanations but obviously that wasn't the purpose of this book. This is a good beginners book for a non-Catholic or a Catholic who doesn't really understand why they do what they do."
3,simple telling of catholicism,"this is a simple telling of catholicism, but be beware, if you have sinned, this book will make you feel that you are going to hell. Go see you priest and he will tell you its not that cut and dried."
1,:(,"This has the ""new"" teachings of the Church, which have lost the beauty and treasures of the true Church.So sad. If you want the ""new"" its informative."
5,Very useful book,"As a convert to Catholicism, with many non-Catholic friends, I find this a very useful book. The style of writing is easy to read and understand and clearly explains matters that can cause confusion.I have used it to deepen my understanding, to answer many of my own questions and to clear up misconceptions among my friends.It is a wonderful resource for any Catholic who wants a quick and clear answer, either for yourself or in answer to a question from a non-Catholic friend."
5,"Universal Knowledge, for a Universal Religion!","Well written, in easy to read/understand english with a few wise cracks thrown in = the Dummies Recipe for success. I bought this item for discerning my vocation into the religious life, and it did not disappoint! I'm fully planning on attending a seminary new year."
5,This is one of the best pop-rock albums of the 80's.,"Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet is a perfect album for those who like the pop-rock sound of the 80's and catchy tunes. All of the songs have great rhythms and melodies. Songs like ""Don't Talk To Strangers"" and ""What Kind Of Fool Am I?"" were hot tracks of the time and had topped the charts. My favorites are ""Tonight"", ""Just One Kiss"", ""I'm Still Crazy For You"" and ""Black Is Black"" If one likes this album, he will surely like the two other excellent Rick Springfield albums: ""Working Class Dog"" and ""Tao""."
4,Success indeed,"Although it's a little too similar to ""Working Class Dog"" at times (especially that opening bass line of ""I Get Excited"", so reminiscent of ""Jessie's Girl"") this album was a fine follow-up to its hugely successful predecessor. There's no resisting ""Kristina"" or ""Calling All Girls"", simplistic though their lyrics may be. ""Black is Black"" isn't bad, just unnecessary. Maybe Rick just always wanted to cover that song; the rest of the album more than makes up for this one indulgence. And all these years later, ""Don't Talk to Strangers"" virtually sparkles. This is a great companion to ""Working Class Dog"", and several outstanding album tracks make it a must-own beyond any greatest-hits package."
4,A Guilty Pleasure,"While this is a classic Rick Springfield album, this is also the album that sealed Springfield's fate as a bubble gum pop star. Just a look at the track listings--""Calling All Girls,"" ""How Do You Talk To Girls"" and ""The American Girl""--will tell you who this album was written for. Still, this is also the album that produced ""I Get Excited,"" ""Don't Talk To Strangers"" and ""Kristina,"" a song which has been given new life during Springfield's 1999 KARMA Tour. This is also the album that contains ""April 24, 1981,"" a song Springfield wrote about the death of his father and the beginning of a theme that runs throughout the rest of his later work. Add this CD to your collection. At its worst, it's formulaic pop. At it's best, it's a guilty pleasure."
1,Would Not Recommend,"I have been using this product for a while and consistently have had the same issues. As a base coat, Double Duty works decently. I use a lot of polishes containing glitter, and Double Duty makes it really easy to remove the polishes - otherwise the glitter sticks to my nails and is next to impossible to remove. However, it also tends to peel up at my cuticles, and eventually my polish will catch on clothing or a towel and peel off in a large sheet. It makes removing polish easy and fun (but horribly unhealthy for my nails).As a top coat, this product is the worst. I can let my nails dry for 4 hours, go to bed, and wake up with imprints of my sheets in my nails. Hours after using it, I can still leave fingerprints on my polish or smudge it. There are other base/top coats out there that are similarly priced and work much better. Would not recommend."
1,Not impressed,"My manicure (with OPI polish) chipped off rather quickly. The base coat didn't seem to adhere well to the nail bed. I only used it as a base coat; I'd heard on the internet that it was dreadfully slow to dry as a top coat. Should I have bought from a pricier line (Seche Vite, Essie)? Maybe so."
3,Mediocre.,This is a mediocre top and base coat. It does a decent job at protecting from staining. Dries pretty slow for a top coat.
1,Awful!!,"What a disappointment. It takes forever to dry and stays gummy for an incredibly long time. Even after sitting without moving for 20 minutes, I ended up with with that nasty rough finish on my nails because the stuff still hadn't fully dried. Waste of money - threw it away after the first use."
3,Sally Hansen Double Duty Base & Top Coat,Good product that helps nails grow really fast. I am very satisfied with purchase and would recommend to anyone as both a base and top coat as well as a nail growth promoter.
1,Staining my Nails,"As this is the only product I've been using for months now, I can only assign the orange stain on my nails to this item, especially since the nail polish never actually has direct contact with my nails. I'm going to be looking for something else..."
2,Pelonis Delux Oil Filled Heater-- Not so delux,"I have several Pelonis oil heaters (2 analog styles). The work very well.I purchased the digital unit to allow more accurate temperature setting. However in practice, the Digital controls are loud and the temperature is control not accurate. I have set it at 70 and seen the small room temperature be 70 (sometimes) or as high as 84! It is very unreliable.I would recomend that the analog heaters work as well as the much more expensive digital."
5,Classic American Music,This is one of the starting points for American Music of the 20th century.The interplay between these two brothers is outstanding.It's like Bob Dylan once said there's probably nothing I'd rather listen to then the Monroe Brothers.I strongly urge real music fans to buy this and all subsequent volumes if they are interested in something that really endures.
1,Acco Presstex 1 in ring binder,"Not worth the money. Very thin and flimsy. The fasteners inside were barely attached. If any amount of stress were placed on fasteners, they would fall apart. Will send this back."
5,Karlinsky si! Chekhov si!,"A fabulous book!! No one could ask for a better read, late at night, with the blankets tucked around one, and a hot buttered rum at one's side!!Chekhov was a man!!"
4,Decent Carcass Imitator,I got this used in the 90's at the local record store for less then 6 or 7 dollars so I didn't expect much. It was better then a lot of Carcass imitators out there and even had decent production to it. If you're into early Carcass and can't get enough of the medical/horror theme in your metal then these guys are worth a listen. It's nothing special but not as bad as some of the imitators out there.
2,not so good,"The cuts are not without merit, CD is only 21 min. long. The band sounds like so many others. If you follow this band by all means buy it, but I like more content in a CD. Lots of great bands out there, i would pick something else rather than this"
5,ACTS Works as good as Stock ACDelco part,I have a vehicle that insists on quality parts and I always replace them with original or Delphi. I can't tell the difference in quality only price when I buy Delphi.
2,It's a start...,"If you are a beginner to the area then this book could be of some use to you. However, for the more experienced practitioner it is limited in its usefulness. The phrase ""beyond the scope of this book"" becomes too repetitive whenever the interesting and challenging topics are mentioned. And it is precisely these modeling areas that differentiate the convertible bond from the more trivial option pricing problems that are covered well in other books. This lack of detail in the meatier areas is the biggest disappointment of the book. Generally it is well written and presents the issues clearly - just not enough of the issues that really matter."
2,I wasn`t too happy!,"There are not too many books on converts, so i tought i buy it. I just tought this book is more detailed on converts.It comes with a floppy disk, nobody uses disks anymore.I would not recommend this book."
3,not enough,"A good start, but not enough detail or complexity. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is anything better."
2,Close to useless,Sometimes reads like a smorgasbord of topics and facts. Don't see the key topics and themese show through in a consistent manner. Never even talks about other models and risk management/hedging challenges in these respects...
1,"A very poor book, repeating old prejudices","This book is absolutely bad, as the author simply recalls the colported informations and rumours about the last emperess Dowager Cixi from an absolute chauvinistic and western point of view. He simply uses the newspaper-stories, which were written in the time of the Boxer Uprising from western yellow-press-journalists and repeats them. I was very disappointed to read this book and I want justice for the Dowager CiXi, who was a great and courageous woman in stormy historic times."
4,UNBELIEVABLE BOOM,I got this amp to power 2 kicker CVR10 with Pioneer head unit in my 97 Toyota Camry. The bass and loudness cracked my passenger window. I'm running them unbridged because i can't stand the bass when bridged.
3,Simple to use,This book works very well as a reference book. If you have a particular business law question it is very easy to scan the table of contents and find the relevant chapter. The material is also concise and up to date.
5,"Funny, Easy to read, Good introduction to Irish.","This Book is a great little read. Read it in the English Language translation that Amazon sells and gain an enjoyable introduction to the childhood of the famous Scriobhnoir, An Seabhac. Or better yet, Léigh é as Gaeilge agus bain taitneamh níos mó as!"
5,The Front is a must see movie about the Hollywood blacklisting,"This is not a Woody Allen film. It is written and directed by people who were blacklisted and had to make a living using a go between to get their work considered. Woody plans the ""front"", the go between for the writers so the studios don't know they're dealing with ""commies"". Woody does insert some comedy with his nebish character but the movie is about a serious topic taken seriously by the film makers."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:I'm sure there's quite a movie out there waiting to be made about blacklisting, and I hope that when this movie is made it does more honor to the victims of the blacklist than this film, which relies on Woody Allen's schtick and Zero Mostel's mugging to little dramatic effect; The Front has good intentions but little success."
5,great stuff,"I purchased this product to realise force feedback in my Game Race chair (from Open wheeler (UK) and pedals and steering wheel from Fanatec (germ)). It does a great job together with the 1000 watt amp.It is of added value in terms of your experience if you play Forza, GT5 with Playstation or Xbox 360 consoles."
5,Shakes your socks off!,"Nice!Hook up is too easy.Just keep the amplifier away from the rest of your equipment.The shaker was mounted under the couch(in the center).The movies that stood out the best were transformers,a couple of Imax films,like Nascar, apolo 13 and blue planet.It Really gave the feeling of being there as oppose to AURA shakers.The 50 watt shakers were fun untill the 1500 watt shaker was fired up.The amp being used is a buttkicker 1900 watt power house.I soon will be buying 3 more shakers like this one for my theater.This is a must buy!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This book is infuriating. This is not a serious engagement with the thought of Heidegger, one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, but rather resorts to name-calling and knocking down strawmen. The author makes no attempt to try and understand Heideggers thought. This book is nonsense don't bother reading it. Read some Eric Voeglin if you want a Heidegger critique who knows what he's talking about and has serious objections."
5,What a knockout! A great read for anyone.,"This book goes straight into the heart and mind of one of boxings greatest fighters. Sugar Ray tells the tale of a true champion, and in doing so it tells the tale of a man who came from an unfavourable begining to reach great prestige and distinction. This book was a knockout!"
4,decent read,it is what it is. you get Sugar Ray's story right from the man himself. its concise and thorough and entertaining and inspirational
4,Sweet as sugar,I gave this book to my dad a boxing fan all his life. He couldn't put the book down. Lots of little known facts and excellantly written. Best christmas present I could give him. If you are looking for a good present for a boxing fan this is the one.
3,Good movie but a few things killed it,"Didn't anyone notice Connie Nielsen's accent changed in this movie like three times. That is all it takes for me to hate a movie. It just shows to me that they didn't pay close enough attention when screening it. Overall Robin Williams gives a pretty good performace. My favorite goes to Gary Cole, who once again plays a boss, much like office space. But this time he isn't taking no garbage, he is the boss and you can take it or leave it. I also think his attitude towards management is great. Some people take their job too seriously, and he just decides to regulate and put them in their place."
3,"Robin Williams is effective, in a creepy role.","An interesting story of obsession and being alone. Although oddly paced and somewhat dull at times, ""One Hour Photo"" keeps you watching till the shocking conclusion. Williams plays Sy ""the photo guy"" who becomes obsessed with a family who brings their film to the photo center he works at. He's so into them, because it's like the family he never had. Williams' character turns out to be quite the sick individual, due to a bad childhood that the screenplay briefly touches on. I didn't know what I was in for when I sat down and hit play on my DVD player. I'm sure this isn't what I expected though. I don't recommend this to those that can't step outside of the Robin William's comedy box. On the other hand it's a pretty good movie for most adults. And Williams is 100% watchable in an unlikely role for him."
4,Beware of the quiet ones,"Robin Williams adroitly plays Sy Parrish, a quiet, lonely, laid back yet marginally sociopathic photo film developer in the smoldering thriller One Hour Photo. Williams is obsessed with a young family with Connie Nielsen playing the mother, who are frequent customers in his Savemart store. He is enamored with Nielsen's young son imagining himself to be part of the family. We learn that this is in response to Williams own wretched childhood.When Williams developes a roll of film belonging to an attractive young lady he detects the family's father played by Michael Vartan, having an affair with the gal. Williams though devastated decides to take matters into his own hands.One Hour Photo plays like a symphony, starting slowly and building to a crescendo which is quite disturbing. Williams was excellent in his role."
3,Robin williams at his creepiest,"this turned out to be a very good movie. At the ending I felt very sympathetic towards williams character (and he's not really the villain here, its the idiot husband who deserves worse than he got). Willaims is very convincing as a lonely, depressed person who has no one and picks a family from his photo customers to be his own, really he is harmless until the husband makes a big mistake. I gave it 3 stars because it does have a few slow moments and the ending was a bit confusing and disappointing."
3,Good movie,The man is talented and this is a different kind of role for him...a creepy one! You will probably never drop you film off for processing again.
3,"hype, hype, hype...","I saw this much overrated movie only because of the great reviews it had received and the fact that it was about the only interesting one playing next to all the teenage-summer dreck. I will admit that the movie is well-acted and has some beautiful cinematography, but its message is such a flawed one. I could never sympathize with ""Sy, the photo guy"". As well-played as the character is, by the time this movie ended I was really angry. This movie's attempt to explain away the personal boundary-crashing behavior of Sy by moralizing was way too heavy-handed. I'll just stick to the foreign imports until Hollywood can churn out something worth watching or buying."
3,"Not scary at all, or creepy","I agree that this is yet another execllent performance by Robin Williams. However, calling this movie scary or creepy is way off base. The movie is kind of slow and personally I didn't think the character was dimented in any way. He was just a lonely guy, that's it. Everybody daydreams or wishes they had more, what's so scary about that. Then he decides to scare the .... out of the adulterous husband, what's wrong with that?? This movie is not even in the same category as Silence of the Lambs as another reviewer described it. Silence of the Lambs was about a considerabley more sinister individual."
4,Thought provoking film.,"Robin Williams is fantastic as an average guy who has become obsessed with his job and with a particular family. There are a couple of scary jolts but be prepared more for an overall sense of unease. The ""creep"" factor is more because something like this could easily happen - who thinks about the people who process our photos?I put this on par with ""The Others"". Twists and turns but not outright freaky."
1,Comedian turned schizo,"Seeing a 4 1/2 star rating and having Robin Williams as the star did not prepare me for the role he portrayed in this movie. Instead of the funn/serious kind of person he normally plays, Robin William performs the role of a lonley man who thinks himself the guardian angel of this family.Living vicariously through their photos, Robin Williams becomes obsessed. The end of the movie was quite a dissapointment because of its ... nature.This movie is not for those seeking entertainment."
1,absolutely pathetic,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever wasted my time on. I don't mind suspending my belief in reality for a few hours while watching a movie... in fact, I enjoy it. But there was no way to suspend as much reality as this film asks you to. The idea that the police would expend all of the manpower and energy on what was (at the time they were first called in) not even a crime, is almost funny. Well, it would have been funny if it wouldn't have just gotten worse and worse. To even mention the film ""Taxi Driver"" in the same review as this movie is an insult. Don't waste your money or your time with this one. It was awful."
3,Strange Movie,"This is one fudged up movie. The movie is interesting, I admit it. But the problem which is a big one is that the whole movie is too open. This movie has a very poor plot,and th ending [is bad]. The ending is way too open, it just blows the movie out of the water. The beginning and some other parts are interesting. This movie deserves 2.5 stars."
3,Creepy,"Sy Parrish, played by Robin Williams, is a middle-aged manager of the photo-printing department of a SavMart. He lives a rather lonely existence, eating his meals in the local coffee shops and going home to a nearly bare apartment. However, Sy harbors a secret fantasy. Having developed the pictures of the Yorkin family for years, he beings to see himself as part of their family. This is when it gets creepy. Eventually the fantasy begins to blur with reality and Sy can't tell the difference. Although it wasn't a movie where you'll be on the edge of your seat, you will want to keep watching more just to see what could possibly happen next."
3,Tell Me What You See,"Sometimes appears a thriller that relies more on character development and a good, gripping story than in continuous twists and trite action sequences. ""One Hour Photo"" is such a case, where Robin Williams creates a powerful character as Sy Barret, a lonely man who works at a photo department in a store. As time goes by, Sy starts to care more and more about a family he met through his job. Slowly, that care becomes an obsession, and we see there`s something terribly wrong.Mark Romanek has directed a few videoclips and creates a stylish, absorbing mood for the movie, capturing the dysfunction and alienation of its main character. ""One Hour Photo"" is a slow, low key though interesting movie that has something to say about today`s society, and despite its somewhat anticlimatic ending still leaves the viewer think about the way he lives and acts with those who surround him. A worthwhile watch and a deep, strong character study."
2,Fades into Oblivion,"It was as if the writer was halfway through the script, then said, ""Well I dont know what to do, lets end it real quick, have the bad guy snap, do some stuff, then roll the credits."" The first hour spends so much time trying to develop a thick, emotional plot; and it works really well. Then it just . . .ends."
2,"Intermittently creepy, but mostly a snoozer","I'm tired of people telling me my standards are too high. But I'm sure I'll get another round of it for poo-pooing this latest attempt by Mr. Robin Williams to act ""creepy"". What's with the bleached-blonde hair? Will the real Slim Shady please sit down- and stay down! There was a real interesting premise, the photo developer who is privy to an awful lot of personal information. But the main family portrayed in the movie is a bit thick to not realize that Sy is not playing with a full deck."
3,"Worth a watch, but didn't live up to the hype","Don't get me wrong I think Robin Williams is great in the role of Sy, the photo guy. At times, I was scared of him, and in the next scene, I felt sympathy for him. It was the story that I found hard to believe. I know that I personally would never get that close to my local ""Target"" photo guy. Plus I would get suspicous earlier, if each time I went in, he pushed his way up to help me and knew my address by heart. Plus the fact that he would write down 3 prints, then cross it out and put 2 down before he gave it back to her, if something was crossed out every time you get your photos back, I'd take my pictures elsewhere. But in the end, a great job by all the actors, and it's worth renting, BUT NOT WORTH ANY 10 BEST LISTS."
3,Empty,"This is, with out a doubt, a film as empty as its subject. The first hour, which includes a few nice cinematic touches (Romanek is clearly a Kubric fundi), do not make up for a narrative which would most probably have fared better as a back story to 'NYPD Blue', or some such vacuous t.v. confection. Williams, although stellar, has not performed quite as much of an about face as many critics have suggested. Instead, he plays up all of those persona traits we have come to expect from him; the nervous glances, the supplicated need for acceptance from the audience. Granted, these character 'tics' have been wholly subverted. The family, on the other hand, seem to have been conceptualized as nothing more than a cold narrative device, a tease in order to force the narrative to it's conclusion."
2,Don't even consider buying this.,"In all honesty, I haven't felt this cheated since I saw that movie ED (Matt LeBlanc and that Monkey) in the sixth grade. This movie was far too predictable and just runs off of a series of awkward moments. Its one of those movies that tries to seem as though it has a deeper meaning, when in reality its just cliche."
3,Short Story Range Material Stretched To Feature Length Showing,"I respect the performance Robin Williams gave here as a lonely, brittle man whose entire life is defined by his job as a photo developer in the sterile world of a suburban megamart. He was both unreachably cold and yet also pathetically needy. His eruption comes late in the film, and it is somehow....not well handled by the makers of this movie. It was just not done right and left scant satisfaction to be had. Beyond that, I felt little connection to this predictable and by-the-numbers movie, and honestly it was a chore to get through."
4,gripping story; slightly weak ending,"This film shows Robin Williams in a shocking and effective departure from his frequent comedic roles. As Sy the Photo Guy, he obsesses unhealthily about one family whose photos he has developed for ten years, keeping a set of prints for himself and his collection every time. He intrudes further into their lives, until things start to unravel as he discovers a secret about them and also loses his job.In the last half hour, he tries to teach one of them a lesson, then ends up with a rather contrived scene which implies some shocking things about his own childhood and how he ended up so mentally unbalanced.The photography and production design give a polished yet sterile feel to the environments in the film, showcasing Sy's lonely, pitiful existence."
2,Super Glossy,"This movie wasn't all that. The most interesting and disturbing scene was where Robin Williams makes the cheating couple pose for some polaroids at gunpoint. Other than that, a somewhat pointless film."
3,i watched it for the cast,this movie is not great but i was still entertained and really felt for the characters i just wish it didnt end how it did but still worth the while
4,"NOT SOMEBODY YOU WANT TO KNOW. AND, YES, ROBIN WILLIAMS CAN REALLY ACT.","Universally, EVERYONE RAVES about the COMPELLING, CONVINCING PERFORMANCE by ROBIN WILLIAMS, and those RAVES are WELL DESERVED. WILLIAMS did a SUPERIOR job portraying a lonely, fragile man living life on the edge of complete mental collapse while entertaining absolute DELUSION. He's the OVERLY FRIENDLY guy at the Save Mart that provides that great customer service and lives to process your film. ONLY, HE REALLY DOES LIVE TO PROCESS YOUR FILM!! Williams OWNS the CREEP factor in this movie, FOR SURE. BRAVO MR. WILLIAMS!! This is a thriller you will be FEELING long after it's over. The movie is a 3 1/2 or 4 star, maybe. ROBIN WILLIAMS PERFORMANCE IS a 5 STAR PLUS!!! YIKES!!"
2,"Bland, tepid","Sounds great, but fails to deliver. Good spooky dream scene where Robin Williams' face does something very interesting, but the psychological impact of the movie is thin as we really know scant little about the main character, so we have no idea why he's got a wallful of pictures, complete with lights, of a family he is obsessed with. Because he's a lonely picture developing guy? Uh, whatever. Normal lonely people don't do these things-sick, medication starved, chemical deficient folks do. I just don't get the point. Sexy Connie Nielsen doesn't even bother to take her clothes off. Why does the movie exist, then? Shock? Criticism? I'm open to ideas, but as for now, this movie isn't worth buying just to see Robin Williams take a malevolent turn."
1,well-made but pointless.,"This is an exceptionally well-made film, everything but the screenplay. It's too predictable, we know everything already from the previews and the beginning. And as a story it's just not interesting. We don't really care about anyone in the film, we're just creeped out. And while it seems like this would be a good film to address many issues, it never really does (aside from the facade of happy suburban life, an issue which has made many better movies).Robin Williams plays Sy brilliantly and makes him believable. The climax scene is almost operatic with the music fitting it perfectly. It's too bad these things were wasted in such a bad movie."
5,Perfect movie,After Robin's recent flops I went with low expectations as the promos struck me as weird. Within 15 minutes I was totally sucked into the story and the characters.It was was the best non Hitchcock thriller I have ever seen.Highly recommended.
3,Creepy,"This psychological thriller about a twisted stalker, while very well acted by everyone (and extremely well acted by Robin Williams) disappointed me as it pushed the familiar buttons, used the typical symbolism to give away people's motivations, and ended in an improbable (but deliciously creepy) way. Wish I'd waited for the DVD."
5,I Think I'm Going to Switch to Digital,"After viewing this particular film, it made me think of the person behind the counter of the one hour photo. Perhaps he or she is learing into to my life or perhaps into my soul. The superb acting of Robin Williams in this film probably made others who have seen this movie ponder the same idea. If you're looking to be ""creeped out"" in a more subtle way than is offered in today's stereotypical horror movies, try and see this movie, it'll be one you won't soon forget.Peace!"
1,1.5 Hours Wasted,"Paint drying, grass growing, watching for water to boil. All aremuch faster paced and more entertaining than watching RobinWilliams not really lose it as a pretty tame psycho. The guyjust wants to be loved, too bad he wants love from a we-don't-care-about-anyone yuppie family straight from the Hollywoodcookie cutter. How this junk rates talent like Williams oreven a theatrical release is a question for the ages."
2,no good,The movie takes you all-the-way to the edge of your seat waiting for the photo man to be a killer and he really is a pussycat. Don't waste your time with this movie.
3,Nice creepy concept but not properly explored.,"The idea of a photo mart employee becoming obsessed with one of his clients is a pretty damn good one in the thriller movie ""big ideas"" scale of things. Add to this some very convincing acting by Robin Williams (of whom I am no fan at all) and some great moments of directing. With this package one would expect to have a classic in the making, but this movie falls well short of the mark. It is never boring to watch, but it simply doesn't explore some of the darker possibilities it alludes too and it concludes with a chop-off ending that won't satisfy anyone. Some viewers will be haunted by the plot next time they get their photos developed, but for me this is an opportunity missed. What might have been a classic doesn't satisfy."
5,One of the best movies ever made.,"Watch director Romanek. A star of the future. This is simply one of the best movies ever made, and as close to perfect as you can get in a movie. Robin Williams is incredible, as usual. If you want a lesson in how to make movies, watch for the scene when he's running down the ramp in the parking garage. This Romanek knows his stuff. At a time when most of the stuff being produced is such garbage, it's surprising to find such a gem."
5,Williams rules,"This guy knows how to not only be hilarious in all of his movies, but he has a serious side as well. Only Jim Carrey is an actor I notice can do this. Williams is truly a legend, and this film is great. It's so dark, and the acting is great. Too bad people are idiots (including myself) and didn't realize this would've been a great movie to watch at the theaters. I saw it when it came out on DVD."
5,Be Prepared!!,"It has been a while since I have seen a movie that made me feel uncomfortable while watching it. Having just watched One Hour Photo I can no longer make such a claim. Director/Writer Mark Romanek has brought out the very best in Robin Williams who, in my estimation, delivers his most significant performance to date. Williams subtley brings a creepiness to the screen in a character the likes of which one would not have though him capable of playing. The film keeps viewers on edge for its entire running time and manages to deliver a few honestly funny moments. I would recommend this film to anyone in the mood for darker than normal fare."
2,No Quite Average,"Robin Williams saves this movie. Without his great character acting this would have been dull. It does make you think about the people developing your pictures and what they are doing with them. Williams plays Sy the photo guy at the local SaveMart. Sy is a bit unusual but you never realize how dangerous, even as the movie progresses. Sy is one third harmless, one third stalker, and one third physco. The movie starts out average and escalates a bit slow but it does move along. But it never seems to peak, it just kind of levels off. And that is unfortunate. There were many avenues that this movie could have walked down but it never did,l it stayed on the main road of an average movie. And I personally was not very fond of the ending but that is an individual choice.If you are a fan of Robin Williams you will probably enjoy this movie a lot. If you are viewing just to enjoy a good movie I feel you will be let down. Better to wait for the video and not feel cheated."
2,"Robin Williams is Brilliant, Many Great Setups Go Nowhere.","Robin Williams is captivating in another display of his acting bandwidth.The photography and casting was first rate.But the story had several great setups that didn't really go anywhere. A premise was setup, suspense was built, only to spin off in a new direction. Several story arcs were cut off short.I was disappointed."
3,Better the first time you Watch,I rate the movie a 4 the first time through. But it's just not a movie I can see people watching over and over. It does a good job of showing what being lonely can do to a person. I wasn't really fond of the ending.
3,Disappointing,"Yes, Williams is great, but the movie falls short. I really wanted to see some depth, and was left with very little to sink my teeth into. You take a slasher flick, take out the violence, add an ambiguous ending, add great a perfomance and a few dream-like sequences and what do you get? A slasher flick with no violence, an ambiguos ending, a great performance and a few dream sequences. I'm not suggesting that they should have just made another slasher film, but you do not create something better than a slasher film simply by taking out the violence. They seemed to WANT to make art, but in the end they didn't really have anything to say. A comment on isolation, privacy, an idealized life? Umm.. not really. Looks great, Williams is superb, pointless."
2,No Suspense,"This film was a real disappointment because there was no real suspense. It was abundantly clear that ""Sy"" was Psycho from the beginning, but there was never the ratcheting up of threat that makes the viewer nervous. The film is full of Hollywood inconsistencies -- the family never really catches on to this guy's wierdness, the muscled husband is intimidated by weakling Williams with a knife, the affair is open knowledge at the husband's company. . . . come on.SPOILIER --- the worst part is that the film-makers didn't even have the guts to give the psycho teeth -- he doesn't hurt anybody, and in the end we are left with a psychobable explaination for what messed him up. Boo hoo.Skip it."
5,A very disturbing masterpiece.,"I found this movie quite good and very chilling. It makes you shake a little when you realize that this very same thing(well not to this extent)could go on in the real world even as we speak.....All of the actors and actresses played very good, believable roles. Its ironic how, at the same time that Sly is doing all this you can still feel a slight twinge of sorrow in your heart for him. As I said above whats so disturbing and what makes you think so much is that whenever you and your family gets your photos developed at wal-mart or CVS or Walgreens or anywhere the lonely person behind the counter could try to latch onto your life and try to make it perfect. All in all this movie was excellent, (sadly)very realalistic, and definatley makes me want to buy a digital camera."
5,A Haunting Masterpiece,"Ever since earlier this year when Ebert reviewed this film after Sundance, I knew this was a movie not to miss. My only hope was that it would reach a wide audience, and not vanish like some art films. Robin Williams has never been a favorite of mine, but this year he has inpressed me 3 times, the darker Williams is much better. First in the much hated by many, but not to me, Death To Smoochy, then as a killer in the very good Insomnia, and finally now, in what I feel as William's best performance ever, One Hour Photo. This film gets in your head and stays there. This film is a must see."
2,Very disappointed,"I watched this after reading several reviews, and man was I let down. The film follows every cliche imaginable-- cookie cutter suspense... Robin Williams is nothing more than the stereotypical creepy guy destined to be a psycho.How much more interesting the film would have been if the stalker would have been someone much more ""normal"" who is going nuts under the surface... so much more could have been done on that level symbolically, with photos never revealing the true nature of things.Anyway... it was ultimately lousy & predictable. If you want to see Robin Williams in a good creepy role, get Insomnia instead-- a much stronger & well made film all around."
5,Williams gives an oscar worthy performance,"""One Hour Photo"" is a very strange kind of film. While casting this film, director Mark Romanek wanted to give the role to Jack Nicholson but he turned it down. With all respect to Jack Nicholson, this was the best news the project could have heard. I say this because Robin Williams is the only actor that could really do a great job playing the character of Sy Parish.""One Hour Photo"" is about photo technician Sy Parish (Williams). Sy is very passionate at his job. He puts his full effort into every photo he develops. He has developed photos for the Yorkin family ever since there son was born. He becomes obsessed with their family and imagines himself as ""Uncle Sy"". Once Sy finds out that Mr. Yorkin is into some shady things, he goes to great lengths to make things right.Robin Williams did a wonderful job in this film!!If you are a fan of thriller/suspense films you should enjoy ""One Hour Photo""."
2,"Showed promise, never delivered","An entertaining movie, but never fully reached the protential that it possessed."
2,creepy but....,"This movie is probably going to manage to 'tick' enough people off: It is very eerie, and I loved the dark atmosphere. wow what a concept! BUT! you keep waiting and waiting (like a suspense movie, maybe like silence of the lambs) for something dramatic or really sick to happen, because the character robin is playing is so unstable and mentally not there, you wait, and wait....and wait...and....NOTHING!! NOTHING EVER HAPPENS, a movie that manages to grab you from beginning to end, just to deliver NOTHING! without giving away too much, what would have made or breaked this movie would have been that final scene. If it had been blood beyond belief, then I would have rated it way better.....but nothing HAPPENS!!! anyway you get the point. Rent it first, bring a pillow."
2,The AFGA machine is malfunctioning,"The perfect version of this movie wasn't even included on the DVD! Shame on Romanek. As evidenced on Foxlight pictures website's forum many members including myself who have seen the edited screen play Cannes' Film Festival version, it's a completyely different movie. I wonder if the viewing public had a choice, if they would prefer a movie that had the ""dumbed down for the masses"" approach by Romanek. First off the screen play version doesn't start off letting you know Sy was apprehended for some crime. It starts with a brooding monologue to capture you in. Romanek did a hack job cutting most of the meaningful William's Dialogues out of the Theatrical and DVD versions.All in all it is still good to see Williams' performance as it is 5 Stars!!!"
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"The movie one hour photo seemed an interesting film to me so i rent it, but then wow! What is that?Its one of the worst movies i have seen this year, the plot goes on and on so slow and eventually when you finish watching the movie you simply ask yourself: WHY? Does it really worth 90 minutes of your life?Well i did not seem to think so; Williams gave a nice performance but nothing more.Honestly, i expected much better."
1,Vastly overrated,"A movie which does not successfully straddle the line between fantasy and realism, One Hour Photo offers plenty of mistakes (be the first on your block to list them all!) and plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Don't waste your time. You want a good thriller? See Insomnia."
2,An unconvincing film about a strange person,"The one-hour photo clerk is obsessed with this one family. He fantasizes himself to be a part of their family and more. He has a wall full of their pictures - an unhealthy obsession even were he one of them.When he discovers that the man of the family cheats on his wife, the clerk goes berserk.The acting and script are unrealistic and phony. Why would the kid, who hardly ever talks to the clerk, be sad imagining the clerk friendless? Or why would the woman that the clerk has a particular obsession with, think of him as ""not deep?"" The characters are very poorly developed and their inter-relationships are left as a matter of conjectures to be inferred based on some stereotypes - not a good thing in a movie trying to scare you with some freakish story.I found my mind wandering as I watched this movie. I'd advice you to stay away too."
1,Extremely boring!,"This was not a thriller, nor was it creepy at all. The actual ""creep"" in the movie was the husband. Avoid this at all costs! No excitement and a disappointing ending."
2,this wasn't horrible...,"...but it wasn't terribly authentic either. I was looking for a more ""classic"" tale about St. Patrick, but this is rather made up from an American perspective. The illustrations are bland. There's got to be something better out there."
3,"Not strong enough, doesn't release that well","I bought this to pick up nails and screws out of my yard following a garage renovation project so my son would not get foot wounds. The magnet is handy in that you do not need to bend down to grab things, but it doesn't pick things up unless the magent is within less than an inch, they are not stuck to the ground, or covered by leaves. It does not let go of everything."
1,BEWARE-IF THEY DONT CHANGE THERE PACKING-IT WILL ARIVE BROKEN EVERYTIME,"Nice looking Cage IF you could actually get it non bent and broken.This was the 1st of 3 cages so far to arrive bent and broken,The packing is real bad so when it arrives it is junk and unusable.This was the 1st,Then I got another one,Same Manufacturers as this cage,Both of those, same thing again,Bent and Broken.All of them sold by amazon as a seller.Amazon is now Looking into it. unless Amazon packs this one different it will always arrive bent and broken Just like all 3 of mine did.I'm now waiting till next week,for them to get there investigation done,so they can pack it better and Hopefully FINALLY get my cage Unbroken!!They SAID they where removing this from there listings,But here it is STILL for sale even though Iv received 3 Bent and broken from poor packing,I even paid to have them overtightened in hopes of that helping..Nope still with a cage!!!"
1,Don't buy!!!!,This is my second cage that has been broken and missing parts. the leg to the cage was sticking out of the box when I received it....I'm sending yet another one back.Some of the pieces were so bent that we could of never got it together. I will not buy it again! Just wanted to give y'all a head's up.
2,"Poor Packing, terrible instructions","Very poor packing by manufacturer. Arrived with main pieces bent. FEDEX failed to meet overnight shipping by 48 hours, filled the box full of holes and bent the hell out of the cage components. The assembly instructions are terrible. Don't buy unless you are good with a hammer like and really good at figuring out how to put things together!"
4,Cliffsnotes Dickens a Tale of Two Cities,"Well I must say that I'm not a big fan of reading, but wow these notes make it a brezze. If you are lazy and have know time to re-read that well, buy the notes..I got them [online]and they have helped me [tremendously! BUY THE NOTES!!! I'm only 15 and well Dickens [is a drag] so buy the notes!!! lol"
5,Salsa is back on this CD !,"Being a salsero from ""back in the days"" - 60's, 70's, ... It is very refreshing to see the ""pendulum swing"" back to those days. The rhythm, arrangements and instrumentation on this CD are that of pure SALSA with reggaeton artists riffing within the music. Not, the other way around. The reggaeton artists blend in with the Salsa music. Andy Montanez is a legend in music who is an original member of El Gran Combo. Daddy Yankee, Julio Voltio and other reggaeton artists performed their singing (rapping) style within the framework of Montanez's music. A great CD for Salseros and lovers of reggaeton."
4,Salsatón,"Aunque no soy fan del reggaetón, me encanta Andy Montañez, y en este disco la mezcla de este género popular y la salsa sale bastante bien."
4,A visual feast,"I saw this movie at the theatre many years ago and it left an imprint on me for it's visual style and Dennehy's great understated performance as the architect Kracklight(sp?). It is not a perfect movie - I thought the sound quality on the DVD was a little muted, the dialogue sometimes juvenile & the actress who plays Kracklight's wife annoying at the very least. With that said, I recommend the movie as of feast for the eyes & ears (Mertens score is perfect!)."
4,Belly of an Architect,"Belly of an Architect: An underappreciated Peter Greenaway film with a title that many people respond to viscerally... it's pure visual splendor and Brian Dennehy is amazing as the frustrated ailing hero. If you're a Greenaway fan, and loved ""Pillow Book"" as I did, check this one out."
1,What Do Customers Usually Buy After Viewing This Item? A Gun...,"...ANYthing to put themselves out of the misery of having spent the time to watch this movie. One of the most aimless wastes of time in my life - worse even than all the accumulated hours I spent as a youth reading ""Nancy"" in the local newspaper. You've been warned."
2,"Somebody has to die, it's a Greenaway film *YAWN*",Pretentiously morbid and opulently crafted. Not for me.
4,Interesting Portrait,"In his most accessible and mainstream film, Peter Greenaway looks at an architect in the days leading up to the grand opening of an elaborate building he has designed. The film looks at all of the nagging doubts that an artist has about life, a legacy, and death. Not for all tastes, but well worth your time. Fans of Greenaway will notice all the usual touches (working art history into the story, for example). One viewer here noted they couldn't get past the first 15 minutes and couldn't understand why the main character was behaving in such a way to his wife -- as in many European films, the characters are a bit more complex and Greenaway takes his time unfolding the character sketches, so the reasons for Denehey's behavior is explained. In all, a very rewarding film for those inclined towards this type of thing."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"I have just finished ""The Mayor of MacDougal Street"" and I couldn't put it down (just like Pete Seeger said in the cover blurb). Elijah Wald did a marvelous job of pulling this book together. It all reads exactly as if Van Ronk had written or dictated the whole thing. It has Van Ronk's flair and wit, his musical acumen, and his glee in sticking in the needle now and again.One thing you might expect from Van Ronk, whose crucial musical development predated the '60s folk boom, is a sort of world-weariness. But he has none of that. Beneath his crusty exterior lies an open mind and an almost childlike awe of good music and good art. What a refreshing book, and what a unique artist he was. His takes on Dylan, Phil Ochs, and Tom Paxton are right on.I knew that Van Ronk died before the book was finished, and I kept waiting for the tone and quality to flag, or the voice to change, but it never did. A great job by Elijah Wald. I've got to buy his other books now."
5,The Mayor Forever,"Dave van Ronk was the Mayor of MacDougal Street, now and forever. He opened up his place to everyone and saw talent and appreciated it. The Mayor was one of the few who did not abandon Phil Ochs and always praised his work, even when it wasn't fashionable to do so and no radio stations were playing any of his songs. Phil has always been the forgotten soul of the movement. Interesting fact that the Coen Brothers are making a fictionalized version of van Ronk's life. I hope they do it right and that it's not just another excuse to pretend that Bob Dylan was the heart and soul of the Village. The Mayor was its heart and soul.The saying goes ""If you remember the sixties, you weren't there"". Not true. I remember the sixties and if you buy this book, you'll remember it too, even if you weren't there.Great Book!"
2,The Mayor of MacDougal Street: A Memoir,"A disappointment, Van Ronk, to my way of thinking was never good for more than one song as an entertainer, and a sound byte if he was being interviewed about, ""the good old days in the Village scene."" His memoir suffers from his dying before it was finished and he never had the opportunity to see it as a whole and do substantial editing and rewrites that were much needed."
4,A disturbing romp into the history of the Wyrm,"This book has me speechless. I have read a ton of Wyrmish literature put out by White Wolf in my time, including the Book of the Wyrm, and I must say that I learned more from this book than all the rest. This is truely one excellent book and a great prop to have around. The only reason this book did not receive 5 stars from me was because of the rather dry Victorian story about the paranormal investigator, but the typed report in the back nearly makes up for it..."
2,For STs Only!,"As in other similar WW produts (Fragile path, etc), this book has a very limited utility. It serves basically for the ST to understand the Black Spiral culture, so that he may better role play the brief dialogs that, in general, player's have with the BS. HOWEVER, for the STs out there who really LOVE to build a political scenerio, this book should rate 3 stars."
5,TRUTH IN RAPID FIRE,a conscious blend of lyrics with the most mangled and varied of bass and drum.delivering from the darkcore and sending a message to the sometimes starched world of lyric and dance.asian dub foundation are coming on !
5,Great for home use,"I puchased my MDF Burr Grinder along with the Gaggia Evolution espresso machine from Amazon many years ago. They were advertised as a pair, and I wanted good entry-level machines for home use.In college, I worked in a coffee house -- ""house"" as in they roasted their own beans onsite. I was trained by an excellent barista and know what a good pull of espresso is supposed to look like, smell like, and taste like.For home use, I am rather impressed with the MDF grinder. It provides a decent amount of settings (mine vary from 4 to 7) and delivers a consistent grind. Yes, it's noisy, but I'm unsure what people expect of a coffee grinder -- they're all noisy due to the fact they GRIND coffee beans. Even professional grinders make some amount of noise; you just don't notice it due to all of the ambient noise in a commercial venue.This machine has served me well for quite a few years and, hopefully, will continue to do so for many more."
3,Not what I expected for the money,"This grinder is not the cheapest you can buy but it definitely doesn't seem worth the money. It does its job and grinds the beans well however it is made of plastic, it came covered in coffee grounds (which makes me think it was used instead of new like described) and standard filter basket doesn't fit, therefore you have to hold it in place and coffee ground end up all over. I would not purchase this item again after seeing/using it. Merely for the fact that I think spending upwards of $200 on an item should mean its not made of flimsy material, fits the components its meant to work with and doesn't come in a seemingly used condition."
4,"Gaggia 8002 MDF Burr Grinder with Doser, Black (purchased on","This is a great grinder. It's got alot of grinding options for whatever kind grind you might desire. I would have to say the only con I have is that the doser is not right for my espresso machine, which is a Starbucks. So, if you're really getting it for mainly espresso making, and you have a Starbucks espresso machine, you'll be really disappointed with that feature. It doesn't fit !! However, if that isn't super important to you, its an initial disappointment and just a minor drawback. You'll love the Gaggia anyway, as I do. Since I've had the grinder, and with with how fast and even the grind is , my home roasted coffee is even more enjoyable. You won't go wrong with this one."
3,Doser feature can be a frustrating problem,"If you use your grinder to grind beans for 2 or 3 cups in the morning the doser feature is useless. You cannot pull all of the coffee out of the compartments. This feature is designed for pulling directly into an espresso filter basket. If you want to spoon it into a drip machine you need to place some kind of dish beneath the doser to catch the ground coffee, and then you have a mess of grounds on the counter.I consider this machine, despite its grinding excellence, to be for strictly espresso use. And even then it's messy."
4,Excellent Machine,"Bought this to use with my rancilio. It seems to have made a huge difference. I thought there was something wrong with the espresso maker as my espresso was always flat and thin tasting. Freshly ground beans is the way to go - vast improvement over preground espresso (illy's or lavazza). I would have given it 4.5 stars, the only thing holdng it back is the silly doser. Either I'm not using it right, or its just not well designed, But everything else makes this a worthwhile purchase to those coffee freaks who can afford it.Update: The doser actually works fine, you just have to get used to it, and I did not pay anywhere near $300 for it. I would buy some sticky rubber feet for the bottom as it tends to slide around when using the doser."
4,"Grinds really well, but the settings are a bit far apart.","I use setting 3 or 4 for espresso, but the perfect setting would have been 3.5. The difference between the steps are too big at the fine grind end of the scale. Other than that, it grinds perfectly for all sorts of purpose--french, drip, espresso."
