5,Worth it,"A wonderful story to illustrate the simplicity of purity to your young child. It is never to early to start reinforcing Bible truths such as the ones illustrated in this book. And while purity is a simple concept, it will take a serious pursuit along with a continual yielding to the Holy Spirit to attain it."
5,Great Service,Princess & the Kiss: A Story of God's Gift of PurityWe bought this as a birthday gift for our grandaughter on the recommendation of her mother.
1,ANTI-Christian,"From someone who went through a 5 year parent led courtship and did not kiss until my wedding - this book is HERESY! Please do not read this to your children if you want them to have a concept of ""the Faith once given"". Thank God Jesus did not live by this message or we would be condemned! This would not prepare anyone for Holy Matrimony; on the contrary, I believe it will propagate a strong sense of Narcissism. ""God's Gift of Purity"" was a bloody Christ who taught us that suffering and humility, not self-righteousness, is the way to holiness."
1,Huh?,This is seriously one of the weirdest books I've ever read in my entire life. I'm definitely not letting my kids have it until they thoroughly understand sex. The metaphor is far too complex for the minds of the age group that this book was published for. There's no way in hell I'm letting my daughter grow up thinking that her virginity is a glowy orb in a glass case.
1,Princess and the Hymen,"The well-intnetioned euphenism of a 'kiss' for the female hymen, plus the use of a cheese dome and a brown paper bag to house this 'kiss' (and or virginity) is only one of the reasons that ""The Princess and the Kiss"" mystifies me. Never mind that the concept of purity is reduced to having had sex or not having had sex, never mind that Christ's death on the cross for our sins (and the purity that comes from forgiveness) is equated with a single act of sex. . .MIND, instead, that this book is written for babies and pre-schoolers."
5,Beautiful Book!,This book is wonderful for young girls! The illustrations are gorgeous and the story helps teach young girls what is truly important when choosing a husband. As a mother of 3 princesses I feel that this is a very safe and helpful book for a growing little lady!
5,LOVELY AND WELL WRITTEN BOOK!!!,"This book is everything I expected and more. What an appropriate, beautifully scripted and illustrated way to teach children about the sacredness and privacy of their own purity. Designed to be treasured in safe keeping until the wedding day when it can be shared with one and the only one person who you marry. This book also stresses the importance and wisdom of choosing the right person to marry who will (also) above all else truly appreciates the purity and gifts of integrity that a Godly young person have to offer and bring into a marriage. Every home and library should have a copy of this story. LOVE IT!! I would without a doubt recommend to others."
5,Must read,Wonderful book. Precious story. Perfect for young preteens. I really liked the book and even read it to my adult ladies SS class.
5,"Wondeful, Wonderful.","Here in the UK, for the past 20 years I`ve been looking for Tompall & The Glaser Brothers version of ""Loving Her Was Easier"" without success. First heard it over 20 years ago on a visit to Tennessee, it was magic then it`s even better now. The CD arrived today, been listening ever since, ""Rings"" what a timeless song, but all the other tracks are jems, I can`t get enough. The harmony is just sublime and so emotional, whoever it was who decided to release this CD, Thank You, Thank You, Thank You"
2,Save your money,"This is the worst ""signature series"" book/cd i've seen. My biggest complaint: ""Love Struck Baby"" is not even demonstrated on CD. Book refers to cd, but tracks are missing. Waste of money!"
4,pretty good. not quite as good as oem,"couple issues with this:1) had to file a little bit to get it to fit like stock2) the swivel thing that allows you to fold your mirrors is not as tight and doesn't FEEL as durable as the factory one did, even after 15 years and 180k miles.3) comes with a shiny black 'cap' thing pre-installed (the factory ones on your vehicle are painted to match the rest of the vehicle). they should have left it detached, though, because then you could put your original on if you still have it and it's undamaged. this is only an issue because removing that black cap thing is VERY difficult to do and requires disassembly of the mirror.overall fitment was pretty good, though, almost as good as OEM. if i had paid more i would have expected a better fit, but for 37 bucks, it'll do. i am happy to have my mirror back, and this is a pretty good product, it seems.and it does come with the adapter to fit '97 model vehicles."
1,Not as advertised,"Purchased this for a 2003 F-150, not the correct part. Even in the paper work it says it's for a 2002 and lower. And as far as the piece itself its very cheap plastic and feels flimsy."
3,You can never doubt what your gonna get!,"This is, in my opinion, the best booster pack at the moment because you will always {95%} get a rare or powerful shiny card.For instance, my 6 year old brother got a 'Black Skull Dragon'in his 3rd pack {Dark, 9 stars, Dragon/Fusion - 'Summoned skull' + 'Red Eyes Black Dragon', ATK/3200 and DEF/2500}.There is only 2 things which lwer the rating of this pack:1.It doesn't have Exodia or any god cards that I know of.2.There should be at least 5 more cards in each pack {same for the other packs}."
3,"The potential is there, but...","Although I am an avid fan and believer in spiritual healing, and sacred healing arts, this book was a disappointment to me. It is an easy read, but for anyone well read in the healing arts it offers very little new information or validation for it's subject matter ( with the exception of chapter ten and sacred water). Just prior to reading this book I finished a wonderful book called ""Infinite Grace"" which left me hungry for more of the same. I did not find it within these pages. God Bless Norm Shealy for his many monumental contrubutions to spiritual healing, I don't believe this book ranks among his best work."
3,Study guide,"This used study guide was in good shape with a few blanks filled in in the intro area. I bought just to evaluate whether our group would use it for our study this fall. I didn't want to pay full price just to evaluate.The price for used with shipping was half of retail which you can get new from Christian Book Distributors (with shipping extra). So, if you need a quantity of new study guides...CBD is the way go on this Navigators series."
3,Probe fails in BBQ,Probe should not be used in BBQ. Apparently the temperature gets to hot for the probe structure. I have had two fail.
1,Junk!,"Look, it's a great device, it is just horribly unreliable. Expect these to last about 2-5 cooking sessions. A shame as the technology is simple, and when it works it's great. Polder just don't care about quality - they'd rather just sell more 'replacements'. Can't recommend."
5,Get a backupand a backup to your backup,A definite must-have if you already own a probe thermometer unit. These probes get dirty sometimes and need replacing. Might want to pick up four or five.
4,Of course it will burn out if the heat's too high ...,"Many here complain that these thermometer probes burn out -- the insulation on the wires of course will melt if exposed to too high a temperature. If you're careful though you can use one probe for quite some time -- I'm into the 8th month with my current one, using it at least twice a week.It's important to note that, even if the air temperature inside your cooking device may not exceed the recommended range, the metal where the wire makes its way out of the device can. I use one quite frequently for grilling -- I run the wire out through one of the rotisserie holes -- and it's important to make sure the wire doesn't contact the grill bars themselves. For an oven at 350 degrees or less I've had no problems at all.When grilling, I also don't actually insert the probe until I know I'm close to finishing cooking -- this helps keep them alive.And, when they do burn out -- they're fairly cheap to replace."
1,Yet Another Dissatisfied Customer!,"I, like so many others, purchased this timer/thermometer approximateley 4 years ago and about a year after I purchased it the probe stopped working. I was tempted to buy another probe, but after reading all the other reviews, I'm not. I do have to say the timer still works well."
5,I love my Polder,"Love my Polder, I've had it for a half dozen years without issues. Unfortunately I left the probe cord on the heating element of my oven and melted it. Certainly glad to find another probe."
3,More fragile than it looks,"I go through a lot of probes smoking venison, chicken and pork. Vynal coated not much better but cheaper than buying new thermometers."
1,Don't Do It!!,"I, like so many others, purchased this about 4 years ago and was able to use it about a year before the probe failed. I do have to mention the timer works well, but I still can't recomend it."
1,Lasted for less than two sessions of smoking,"I have use Polder brand products including replacement probes for years, but the latest version of probes is a complete and utter failure. The replacements and new probes on recent shipments of thermometers all have a heat-resistant plastic-like coating over the probe wire much like a heavy guage coated wire rather than the prior successful metal mesh exteriors. Those with mesh occasionally kinked if abused by the user, but they never totally failed to give a reading with such short life. The mesh ones were good for one or more seasons. I am thoroughly dissapointed with Polder's ""new and improved"" probes. This, of course applies to any of the Polder products shipped with the new worthless probes. Another disturbing thing is that the photos of the probes appear to be the old mesh covered good ones and nothing in product description says anything about a different probe."
2,Unreliable!!!!,"These things are accurate-until they ""fail"".unfortunately this usually happens with a $70 prime rib. Now I set the thermometer (which connects this piece of junk) at 100*F. I then recheck with a Thermapen.What a hassle! Too bad NONE of the Polder/Taylor units feature a calibration option.How to avoid failure? If anyone knows-please advise me! (I do not immerse in liquid, do not expose to hi <350*F temp, do not kink wiring...)"
1,Probes Fail very quickly,"I have really enjoyed the digital thermometer, but the probes fail very quickly. They have lasted only 3-4 uses in outdoor cooking. I returned the thermometer to a local retailer and exchanged for others a few times--I think they may be discontinue selling them. I have recently bought a Taylor, very similar and it looks very much like the Polder--the probe is virtually identical. I think they are made by the same manufacturer. It is a great instrument if they will ever make one that will last a while."
1,I should have listened!,"Failed after the third use as a replacement probe for my Sharper Image thermometer which had reliably served me on hundreds of bbq's over several years. Cheaply made, no where near as rugged as the original. Don't waste your money! Amazon - take this off the market!"
1,Does not work over 200 degrees,"Bought the probe to replace the probe that came with my Polder therm. Was making candy with the new prob and realized it would not go over the temp. of 200 degrees. Quite frustating when you are in the middle of making candy. Not sure whether to order another one, or ditch this thermometer altogether."
1,Does not work correctly,"Does not work with Taylor model thermometers. I have one model that is several years old and another that I purchased a few months ago, on both this probe registered 60 degrees less than the actual temperature."
1,Woefully Inaccurate,"Tested this out of the box and it registered ice water at 46 F and boiling water at 186 F. I'm pretty sure it's the probe, as I got identical readings using the probe in two different thermometers, the Polder 362-90 and an older Taylor model. Oddly enough, it got the room temperature accurately, but I don't usually cook a roast to 77. I'm going to have to consider getting a new and different probe thermometer now."
3,"Works, but often needs to be replaced. Overheats easily.","This is the THIRD replacement probe I've bought for my Polder timer/thermometer. I think I've had it with this thing and won't bother with any more replacements. It's slow to pick up a temperature reading (it is NOT ""instant read"" thermometer!), which is bad if you're using it for candy making or chocolate. You can, however, stick it in a meat and stick it in the oven. It overheats pretty easily, which renders it useless and then you have to buy another probe. I think Polder is actually in the replacement probe business, that's probably how they stay afloat."
3,Instruction only.,"I think it's a pretty helpful for graphic instruction for most of them, but some are little confused. I wish there is a explanation at the end of the book and why the designer emphasize some part and not the other."
3,it's ok,"overall an entertaining book. but i have a dilemma on where and when exactly to ""read"" it. it's too small to be a coffee book table; it's not something you'd read in bed. but it's a nice addition to a non-conforming books collection."
1,It tastes off..,"You would think that something as simple as yellow mustard would be impossible to ruin, but this company seemed to do so. I will never buy this again what a waste of 27$ for subscribe and save. I don't know one guy seemed to this it, It tastes bad to me."
3,A little too narcissistic for my tatstes,"First let me say that Jerry Stahl is a good writer. This book does not disappoint because Stahl can't get his point across clearly or in an entertaining way. It's just that he covers the same ground again and again and again. He tries for self-depracating humor which works early on, but by the half-way point the reader knows what's coming next. More self-loathing, more flashbacks to a cruddy childhood and more platitudes about loving his child while simultaneously shooting up. Apparently, Stahl finally kicked his addictions, but he doesn't ever really explain his enlightenment. I give Stahl an A for realism and showing that the life of an addict sucks, but I give him a C for redundancy and a C on his self-analysis."
5,Grinnin' and kickin',"PERMANENT MIDNIGHT is the true, harrowing story of a tv screenwriter who needs to get high to churn out your typical, mindless, boob tube pap. That alone should teach you something: if you're sane, sober and intelligent, don't try playing the Hollywood game. Not by its own rules, anyway. Sad, yet hilarious, Stahl's book reeks of reality and burned out dope dreams: definitely not your average, self indulgent ""smack"" memoir."
4,this is one of the most insightful looks into drug-addiction,"This is one of the most horryfing books that I have ever read. I myself am chemically-dependent, and have just fought asevere struggle with crack cocaine. ""Midnight"" captures the sweaty, paranod feelings that junkies can relate to oh so well. There were times when I actually felt myself becoming sick with dope pains(this feeling of intense nausea that starts in one's toes and ends up as a large sinking feeling in one's stomach). I am glad that Jerry Stahl wrote this important book, and that he is now among the living. this book should be the sole basis of the ""just say no"" campaign, and taught in highschools everywhere."
4,Interesting to watch...,"I got it for my mom for Christmas. Here it is mid-March and she's still watching it almost every day.I found it interesting (actually a little frightening) to look at the ""old"" country stars from my youth who now look young, compared to me.The interviews were a little disappointing but the Grand Ol' Opry performances are fun to watch.Not sure it's worth the price ... It did make my ma happy though, so I guess that justifies it."
2,Poor Quality,"This case is only partly aluminum, the rest is a cheap plastic and easily scratched. Foam is of poor quality and easily torn. The hydrometer is plastic and falls out every time you open the case. For the price, I was expecting better quality. I would not purchase this item again, nor would I recommend it."
2,Not exactly what I wanted,"I wanted to learn how to make basic clothes for miniature dolls. While the techniques presented are interesting, they are of high quality sewing. I can sew basic items, but she talks of perfect stitching and some of the stitch illustrations are not clear in how they are done. One would need to spend a lot of time practicing the stitches before being able to work at her level. For me, the book has some interesting facts but the scope is beyond the ""good old basics"" for a novice."
5,The Miniature Costumier: Removable Clothing for Doll's House people,This is an excellent book giving patterns and complete instructions for making removable clothing for dollhouse dolls. This is a real keeper. Anyone wanting to dress their own dollhouse dolls will love this book. I really love this bookDiana
1,"Great idea, regrettable execution","This baster needs to be made better than it currently is. In MANY ways. First of all, the bristle head is so small that it would take half an hour to baste a whole turkey with pan drippings. Second, don't plan on basting with anything thicker than water: for example, I wanted to paint beaten egg onto some bread loaves, and the squid couldn't handle it, even though the egg was well-beaten and more liquid than viscous. Same catastrophe with warmed sour cream for a coffee cake. And third, just try to clean it well after use! This tool needs to be made bigger and to be almost completely redesigned."
2,Not great,This book is like a compendium of online information. A bit expensive for content provided. Don't expect more than a cursory overview of topic.
2,Not As Expected,All this book does is briefly (and I mean briefly) go over tax laws in each country. The entire information could have been reproduced on a chart and not a large book - the book could have been useful if it was comprised of any analysis.
3,"Artie can swing, but...","Artie Shaw has spent his life posturing and trying to convince everyone he was ""better"" than Benny Goodman. His famous quote is, ""Goodman played the clarinet, I am a musician."" Unfortunately, Artie's ego is greater than his music as this disc amply proves. He was a brilliant musician and his post-1930 orchestra was an exceptional unit, but he never had a swinging band as great as Goodman, nor did he use the same arrangers Benny used. His tracks simply aren't as enjoyable as Benny's and the comparison is valid since Artie is the one that has shoved it down our throats for so long.Begin the Beguine is marvelous, but some of the other songs are strained, at best. Deep Purple is plodding and I Cover the Waterfront is a poor arrangement.This is a good sampling of Artie's work, but if you want real swing and a truly great clarinetist, latch onto Benny Goodman instead."
3,Good Introductory Collection,"Though not as good a collection as the two-disc set is, the ""Greatest Hits"" issue offers a very good introduction for anyone curious about Artie's music. For those already familiar with Mr. Shaw and just want the hits this is a spot-on release. His version of ""Stardust"" is worthy of a replay every time it comes on, not to mention ""Begin The Beguine"" and of course ""Frenesi"". I miss ""Back Bay Shuffle"" not being on here along with ""Take Your Shoes Off Baby (and start runnin' through my mind)"" and his six-minute rendition of ""St. James Infirmary Blues-parts 1 & 2"" but those can be found elsewhere. Whether with his small group or big band, Artie Shaw always delivered."
5,Great Book! Best I've Read.,"Definetly a must-read. Excellent suspence, while confusing, and mystic. Cass and Maddie discover the unknown life of a Mr. Magnus, who lives in the suite below Cass. He lived in the trenches in WWI. Could Cass be Mr. Magnus in an earlier age? Is Mr. Magnus an Alchemist? Read to find out."
3,Doesn't stay sharp long,"I used this to cut foam insulation. I cut several pieces of 2"" foam insulation with this and by the end of the first day it was tearing the foil. It also is dangerous to put your finger on it to add pressure near the blade. If you order this order cut resistant gloves too."
3,Overman should throw the dice a few more times!,"Overall a good review of what has already been written. The overall theme of the book is where the emphesis should be in the critique of evolutionary thinking, information theory and the origin of meaningful complexity. The footnotes provide a good reference source. Overman's example of throwing a 7 in ""a game of dice"" gives a probability of 1/6. This would only be true if there was a die with seven dots on one side instead of one of the other usual configurations. Two die are needed to ""make"" a seven. There are three possible ways of making a seven out of about 22 possibilities. This may seem to be a minor and somewhat trivial complaint, but when one is presenting numeric probability calculations instead of just commenting on probability per se, better care should be taken. Perhaps the reviewers on the back dust jacket only glanced at this section, but with their credentials they should have spotted this glaring error."
1,"A lot of work, but ultimately just wrong.","Sometimes you've just got to read what the guys on the other side of the fence are saying. The antidote to this book is Dawkins' 'The Blind Watchmaker', and of course, vice versa. However, I have seen with my own eyes self-orginization work. I have seen simulated evolution work. Anyone in doubt should search the web and take a look at Karl Sims' artificially evolved swimming fish... you will instantly recognize them as life. This book was a lot of work, but ultimately, it is just wrong."
2,"If you accept the working premise, I guess it makes sense","The problem I have with this book is the assumption that ""accident"" and ""self-organization"" equal the same thing.Can't help but wonder, if it's so statistically improbable that molecules could form (and, by the way, the better arguments in favor of this proposition are conveniently glossed over), where did God come from? (Talk about statistically improbable...)"
5,Easily the best of the TNG episodes...,"Every bit of it just works. Captain Rachel Garrett turns in a GREAT performance as the captain of the Enterprise-C . Patrick Stewart's finest performance as Picard; a harder man who has seen many more battles than his alternate-timeline counterpart; carrying the weight of the knowledge that the war with the Klingons does not go well for the Federation. He doesn't smile once.The final line in Picard's battle speech to his crew, as he explains that the Enterprise-D MUST protect the Enterprise-C at any cost: 'Let us make sure that history never forgets the name Enterprise.' Best line ever spoken in Star Trek."
5,A hinge point for several story lines,"This haunting tale is one of my all-time favorites of any of the series. Any ship bearing the name ENTERPRISE is always going to represent humanity's best. This episode portrays the noble character of Star Fleet officers, and brings to mind ""The City on The Edge of Forever."" Whoopi Goldberg puts in an outstanding performance."
4,Excellent concise source on Reality,"If you never understand for example why with a trillion dollar budget America can't solve a simple problem like education or health care when smaller nations with smaller budgets have, look no further. This book explains the differences between economic democracy, which is what America as a capitalist-fascist nation is, and a political democracy, which is what most Americans think they have. It summarizes the history of humanitarian democracy which as fallen to the wayside as economic democracy has armored up, stockpiled her weapons, and run rampant around the globe in the name of ""freedom"" and ""democracy."" This book is straightforward, concise, economical and approahcable. It gives a crash course on economic injustices and why they continue to happen (and will probably continue until corruption destroys civilization and we start all over AGAIN)"
2,"Excellent content, poor teaching","I got this dvd just to learn some casual dance moves. There is no question that Jeromeskee can move, but the instructional aspect of the video is minimal. By the time the narrator has verbally explained what to do and you begin to do it, Jeromeskee has already gone onto the next step. I'm no pro dancer, but I'm also not uncoordinated either and it was frustrating to not be able to keep up at all. I'm going to break the rewind button on my dvd player pretty soon. More time could have been spent explaining in detail where to place your weight, when to shift feet, etc. rather than just showing it and not giving enough time to figure it out before already moving to the next step. Slow down! I purchased this ""beginner"" video thinking I would get detailed instruction, but it was moreso just a voice-over and some guy that can move way faster than I can."
2,"if you are not a gentle, occasional user ... don't bother","i use a scale in my kitchen fairly frequently, as i inherited a lot of recipes from my grandmother who measured in monumental quantities. for the first few months i was happy, scale measured in pounds and ounces instead of pounds and fractions (unlike my old one), had a tare function, large display, etc. then i accidentally splashed water on it. scale started shorting out periodically, part of the display flickered then died; now i can only see the top half of the numbers. it was the least expensive one in the store -- well, you get what you pay for. will be shopping for a more expensive, waterproof model."
3,"OK, but not very durable.","Decent and relatively accurate, but I don't like that it shuts itself off after a couple of minutes, usually while I'm in the middle of doing something. Also, I've had it maybe a year and the on/off button doesn't always work anymore."
1,Failed after a year,I received this as a gift; one year later the display started showing 'error' and now it won't work. What a waste!
2,Good for a while...then kaput.,"Good scale when you first get it. Very nice. I used it for weighing postage as well as food. But, alas, eventually after about 2 years the digital read goes bonkers and you can't read the numbers anymore. I tried changing batteries, etc. it's just dead. Choose another model and spend a few more bucks for one that will last."
3,"An interesting assessory, however...","This is a rigid hood that screws into the lens housing. It does what a hood is supposed to do...block stray light and give some protection to the lens. However, the hood does not come with a cap, and there is no way to put the original lens cap on without taking the hood off. The hood also blocks the lower half of the flash. So, the hood is sort of interesting, but not really convenient. The soft hood at $5 is a better play thing."
5,Nikon HN-CP11 Lens Hood,This is an excellent addition for the Nikon 5700 camera. It adds little depth but it provides a great protective area to prevent lens damage. Size has minimal increase for the protection provided. Also it helps greatly in sunny conditions where the angle of the sun may affect the photo light settings.
3,decent movie that makes you laugh and then you forgetaboutit,"This movie was very very confusing while I watched it. It was most likely done on purpose and it does come to a semi-satisfying resolution near the end. Overall, it's one of those movies you watch and then you forget about about 10 minutes afterwards. It's a typical cops and robbers and drug dealers movie except you don't know who exactly is the bad guy and who exactly is the good guy. Two people swap identities by swapping passports and clothing. I watched this about a week after seeing the Usual Suspects and I thought there were a few attempts to copy of the Usual Suspects. From the confusion that is only revealed near the end to the bulletin board with all the pictures, I definitely sensed lots of Usual Suspect coming off it. The movie can be fairly amusing at times and it's definitely very humourous! Plus there's a really cute, fluffy dog in it :) Watch it if you want some quick, easy entertainment but if you're looking for"
3,Craig Sheffer fans will love this movie!,"I will try and be objective, but I will admit that I rented this because I am a HUGE fan of Craig Sheffer! It's not his best, but it's pretty good. It's a simple story about mistaken identity. A man goes to jail for murder and ""Conner"", Sheffer's character, is the witness who puts him there. ""Conner"" has a razor sharp memory and is ""101%"" sure that he has the right man. A while later, ""Conner"" see's this murderer on the street! He becomes convinced that he's put the wrong man in prison, so he goes on a crusade to prove the man behind bars is innocent. Rent the film and take it from there. I will say that Sheffer is very, very good in this film. He has an extremely expressive face. He can say more with a look than some actors can say with pages of dialogue. I don't know why he hasn't received the recognition he deserves."
2,Good for stop-gap playing...,"If you don't expect to play DDR for very long, or your kids are the kind that like the newest fad for only a couple weeks, then this pad is what you want. We had three or four people (from age 9 to 40, 55-210 lbs) playing it and the pads slipped, ripped, and broke. And most of the stomping and abuse was from the 9 year old. After we went through two of these pads in a week, the consensus was that we should probably spend the money for a metal arcade/type pad. We tried three different types of pads, then ended up getting a metal pad off eBay, which has been terrific. Somewhat hazardous, but terrific. Nevertheless, if you don't have the money for frivolities like that, I'd say this is a cheaper substitute."
3,Bad dance pad,"If you're a serious DDR player, do not get this dance pad. Go ahead and spend the money on a better one. You have to straighten the mat out after every song. It would help if you could straighten it during songs, but that's a little impossible. If you do not straighten it, it ends up getting all crumpled together which makes the sensors in the wrong spots."
1,This pad is not for DDR!,"DDr has no diagnal arrows. DDR pads only have 4 buttons on them. Do not get this dance pad. The only good dance pads out there are by REDOctane, the other pads rip and their sensors shift out of place so when u go to hit one arrow u hit another button instead. TRUST ME I AM A DDR FINATIC. I have gone through all kinds of pads and the only ones worth buying are by RedOctane.See for yourself, go look at the REdOctane dance pads."
1,What a disappointment,"When I ordered this product, I thought I was ordering an identical product to the one that came with the game. I was sorely disappointed. This product is almost impossible to use. All I did was slip and slide around on it, nearly falling more than once. This product is dangerous at best. I'm trashing it."
4,its pretty good for a while,"I had a good experience with this pad pretty much. I had it in my college dorm and people used to come by and play it all the time. I used the little sticky things that came with it to keep it in place and it works the pad didnt move around and I got full combos on light. but u can only use the sticky things in one place, if u pick it up and move it they wont be so sticky anymore which was fine for me I just left it on the dorm floor. but after a month of students stomping and me playing on heavy mode, the back arrow started to malfunction. it started activating the top and back arrows simultaneously and some times it acted as a select button and some times is didnt register at all, but I just bought another one. I might up grade to the styrofoam pad I heard its better..but this one is pretty much good for the abuse it took..if u have a smooth floor to stick it to I say go 4 it!"
1,Don't get it,"I was looking for a ddr dance pad this summer, and when I came to this one, I first looked at the reviews and thought,""WOW!! I want this!!"" The next week I ordered the package with no problems. I was so excited when I finally got it that I immediately opened it up and played it. Everything was fine until one week later. I was just a beginnner at the time to DDR so I only played on the beginner level. Then, all of a sudden, my arrows started to go out. I stomped on them as hard as I could to get them to work. I did this routine for a couple of more weeks unitl just last week. Last week I sprained my ankle because of this pad, and I will never use it again. PLEASE DO NOT get it!!! It is horrible, and you will get hurt from it!!!"
4,Fun item,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for our 9 YO daughter. She really enjoys playing it. Item seems to be good quality, and works well. Only problem we experienced is the mat slides around on our carpet during game play. Could be remedied with some kind of included add on?Item was shipped quickly, and packaged well to prevent damage. Price was very competitive with similar items."
1,"buttons malfunction, frustrating",I got two of these pads and both malfunction. They slip around the floor and don't always register where you are steping on. THis is really annoying when your trying for the big combos and it's killed by the sensor.
4,Konami Dance Mat,"This Mat Has a Good solid construction, although it's nothing on the RedOctane pads; it's excllent for beginers and is usually shipped with DDR Max and DDR Max2, In regards to another comment - There are 6 arrows on a correct DDR Mat/Pad; Although only 4 Are used in usual play, The Extra 2 Diagonal Arrows are for ""Solo"" mode which would suit those who have a DDR Solo Aracde machine in their local Arcade."
1,Cheap Imitation,This pad is just a cheap imitation. It's not a Konami liscenced pad. It even came with horribly translated instructions. The sensors don't work properly and the pad's material is not the same as a good DDR pad. I seriously can't play with this mat. I would recommend that you buy a GOOD pad and not a 10 dollar one. I'm sending this piece of cheap plastic back from where it came from. Buying this pad was a mistake on my part. Don't make the same mistake as I.
1,Doesn't work with a ps2/usb adapter,"I bought this to go through a ps2/usb adapter into my pc, and it doesn't even read as a normal ps2 gamepad. I even bought a brand new adapter thinking it was my old one starting to give out; and still got no improvement."
4,Tobruk before the fall,"I was pleased that the book covered how the Australians were pulled out and the 70th Infantry was inserted. The book really covers that time period, not before and not after. I was hoping to get some insight into the fall of Tobruk. All in all, this is a good piece of reference material."
4,Good book,"Like all books in the Osprey campaign series, this volume is meant to be an overview of a specific series of battles. In this, Jon Latimer does excellent work. As always, the format of the campaign series does well to give a feel for the campaign. Latimer even goes into some detail on the role of the antiaircraft artillerymen in Tobruk, a vital but often overlooked aspect of the siege. Overall, a good reference about Tobruk or a light read well worth looking into."
2,Waiting for April...Waiting for Something to Happen,"Much ado about _nothing_ sums up this book. Page after page of hints, insinuations, and woeful angst over a climax that is paltry at best. If one of the main characters got a hangnail it would incite tremors of disaster and foreboding for at least 10 chapters. Portions of the story reminded me of Pat Conroy, but Morris doesn't follow through with a truly horrible event that rightfully shapes (or mis-shapes) the characters' lives. Morris moans on in an overly flowerly prose about nothing. Without a good story and cluttered with overworked text, there is very little to recommend about this work."
5,A Must for Female Vocalists' Lovers!,"Miss Haines is an exceptionally effervescent,gifted,and musically versatile singer of all genres. She sings with great ease and warmth,brimming with an enthusiasm unparalleled in her day. Her diction,phrasing,timing,and sense of rhythum are impeccable. Totally refreshing and joy to listen to!"
5,Good china,My wife really likes the pattern. It goes with everything - all colors. It is very versatile. Cleans well.
4,What?,"My dogs love toys that make funny noises at them, too! We have several Multipet toys. My dogs not not chewers or tearers so they've been very durable. We have an elephant who lost leg, but continues to roar or whatever that sound is. So far we've successfully chosen the right ones. I found via reviews that the koala giggles like a baby which we won't get, but what do some of other ones say? Like what in the world do goldfish or lobsters talk about? This is a serious topic for us since we humans can't tolerate some of the noises the guys think are fascinating!Help, please include in your reviews approx what kind of talking sound we can expect! Did you know that the cow can be persuaded to make several different mooing sounds? Our pup just discovered them and now won't relinquish cow."
1,"Don't waste your money! Content Good, Product the WORST!","I got in the mail what I thought might be a legit box-set of 4-discs of rare material, but what I got was 4 very low quality-DVD-R's. 2-of the 4-discs won't play at all. Total cost to make these pirate box sets is $3.00 and they are selling these defects for $40.00 ???I tried three times to contact them for at least a replacement, and got no reply to date!Go- figure, but save your money from this company, they're called SQUARE DEAL. Not quite!"
3,a worthy first effort,"Paula Woods debuts a new entry into the world of mysteries - black homicide detective Charlotte Justice is an interesting and compelling character. Her unique status as a female and African American in the LAPD makes this an interesting read. The mystery on the other hand is not too shocking and uses the ABC method (the murder is not A, or B, so who's left method). The police procedure aspects could also use a bit of work and further technical authenticity. The personal life portions and the dwelling of her romance, in particular the sexual encounters, is at times embarassing and unnecessary. However, despite all of this, it is still a worthy read simply to get a fresh perspective in this sometimes cliched genre."
2,NOT SATISFIED,"Read this title as a book club selection based upon reviews by other customers. I was not at all impressed with the story. I do give much credit to the author as I feel she is a great writer, however, I did not enjoy the story and once you find out who did what, I simply was not suprised. Think the author could have did better on the plot as it wasn't a thick one!"
2,forget it,"i wanted sexy women fighting in a ring...what i got were over weight wrestlers in well covered tights, not even showing cleveage, and only once did i see tight denim shorts on a hot body............the wrestling wasnt too bad, but in no way are these girls athletes, very disappointed"
4,"over all, a time-worthy autobiographical historical peice","Although I've read this book before, this time, as an older and wiser reader I was able to recall a lot more information and specifics that had slipped my mind since the previous reading. As a non-native spanish speaker, it was easy to follow, in a dialect I could easily translate if necessary. Plus, this book is useful in the spanish classes that I teach in portraying a realistic view of guatemalan history."
4,A good starting place,"Released as a stopgap after Siren, Let's Stick Together consists of outtakes from Ferry's first two covers albums, and remakes of Roxy songs. The latter songs are not especially necessary, but they are more accessible (and Ferry's vocals are less histrionic) than the originals. The covers are uniformly excellent. This album may not be a stunner, but is very consistent and fun, and would work as a good starting place for newcomers curious about both Ferry and Roxy Music. (Ferry's pencil mustache on the cover is hilarious.)"
4,Let's Stick Together,"Let's Stick Together being Ferry's 1975 release and his third solo album and contains material released as singles , b-sides and an EP. Songs that I like on this release are ""Let's Stick Together"", ""You Go to My Head"" and ""Sea Breezes"". The cover is really nice with Ferry looking ever so suave with a nice shirt, jacket and tie. No lyrics are included but we get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."
4,Stuck Together,This patchwork quilt of an album isn't necessarily the best place to check out Bryan's solo career. Despite its pedigree (this was originally an EP in the Uk. Atlantic Records in the US added some b sides and a single and ta-da! instant album.The Roxy tracks (along with Price of Love and the title track) are the most interesting. Ferry reinvents some of them improving on the original versions. Not a bad album but not the place to start to check out Ferry's solo work.
3,"The best of Ferry, but far away from Roxy","""Casanova"", ""Sea breezes"", ""2HB"", ""Chance meeting"" and ""Re make/Re model"" are cover versions of Roxy Music stuff. Was it the time that Ferry decided not to go on with the artistic-progressive line of the band? Till then he had 2 albums of cover versions, but not of his own band. Anyway it's a good album and also ""The price of love"" and ""Lets stick together"" are well done. Actually, it's the best of Ferry alone, and yet, i did'nt give it more than 3 stars. The 5 star albums belong to the old Roxy Music."
1,Useless,I found the book discouraging!The author does not guide me through installing and getting phpnuke started at all.. instead of helping out he discourages readers to just send their php files to hosts which have already installed phpnuke ! if i wanted to do that why wud i buy book?I can quote innumerable instances from the book which are discouraging.. and the entire book is kind of irritating..Not recommended at all..The free FAQ listing on php-nuke website does a much better job than this book.
2,Cheap Mouse....... didn't last,"The mouse felt cheap right out of the package. Very light, good size and comfortable to use. However the thumbwheel was inconsistent in controlling from the start, and now (less than a year) the left mouse button has started generating multiple ""clicks"" each time I press down..... causes all kinds of problems... multiple deletions of e-mail, opens stuff when I don't want it opened, etc. I getting to a point where I have stopped buying Logitech stuff anymore; I've had other issues with their desktop cameras and joysticks."
2,Inexpensive but worth far less,"My second purchase of a Logitech item. Both performed barely passably, even given their price, and both broke within two weeks. What a lousy company."
5,Form and function,"This Logitech mouse simply gets the job done, and does so very well. The shape has those subtleties that make it feel right - comfortable but also signaling that it's a mouse. The optical bit is precise. It doesn't feel too cheap, though it is very inexpensive. I've used cheap Logitech mice for years, when one finally starts to go, the replacement is just as good. I hope they keep making something like this for a long long time."
4,Dino,Great vocals from a charter member of the Rat Pack. Some may argue that the song selection is lame but he brings a nod and a wink to the songs delivery.
4,Great card for UFC (but Pride still rules MMA),"This was the best card that the UFC has had in quite awhile and I have seen the last 20 or so cards. The first reviewer was a little harsh in his review. Sure, Pride is a better org. with a lot more talented fighters than the UFC. That is a no brainer. The talent level is not even close. Pride is vastly superior. However, there are a lot of talented fighters on this card so it is definitely worth purchasing. A REAL mma fan will enjoy this dvd. UFC 60 & 61 is another matter. Two real weak shows."
3,"5 Stars for Helen and Benny, 0 Stars for Collector's Choice","Helen Forrest is one of the great vocalists of all time. The idea of her complete recordings with Benny Goodman is irresistible. Unfortunately Collector's Choice could have tried to do justice to this music by remastering them properly. As it is, these disks are unlistenable to me and that's a sad thing since Helen Forrest is my favorite vocalist. They sound is mostly shrill and actually gives me a headache. I am tempted to rip the songs into raw wav files and give it a go. I can't do worse than Sony has.I highly recommend Helen Forrest's recordings on Jasmine Records. The two disks, Sweeter as the Years Go By and Simple and Sweet, are mostly with Artie Shaw are just great music. These are also wonderfully remastered and are very highly recommended.If you love Helen Forrest, as I do, you must own this boxset with Benny Goodman, but be prepared for very bad sound quality."
2,Not for me,I expected this was the CD version of the old computer game. It isn't. It's an updatedversion that I found impossible to play very well. I wish it had been the original.
2,Awful Company for IBook Batteries,"This battery was a Light Grey color (not white for the iBook) & the 14"" version never changed."
3,"Good Design, poor Stainless Steel","This rack is very well designed, but the stainless steel does not have enough nickel in it, so it rusts. At first I thought it was just at the welds, but the wires themselves are now pitted and rusting after 6 months of use. The polished pan has no drainage lip, so the water sits in the pan, and dries, leaving a mineral deposit. It has to be cleaned frequently."
1,New book is a hoax,"While it may have some pretty pictures done by James Churchward, it does not follow his original works, in tone, language or content. I also believe that handwriting analysis will show that James Churchward never even wrote the book.This is a cheap money-making scheme to capitalize on the 'fame' of James Churchward, who was never in the British Army or attended Oxford or discovered any ancient tablets. History has shown him to be disreputable and dismissive of reality.Please do not waste your money."
5,Svetlanov!!!,"Sad to say Svetlanov did not record much Shostakovich during his lifetime! This is a very fine account of the 5th symphony(one of shosty's most popular) paired with the Festive overture. This recording is long out of print but might still be available in Japan so if you can get your hands on it, get it! Amazon's listing doesn't tell you, but this recording is on the Canyon Classics label."
2,not helpful if you have anything but a very short lens,"I have an SLR (Nikon D50) with a pretty short/compact zoom lens. This cap tether didn't work at all as when the lens cap is on the lens, the tether wasn't long enough to reach the camera body, therefore nothing to attach the cap TOO."
1,cheap,"the cord is too short, the attachment clip for the camera doesn't fit on the grommet on the camera, and the adhesive on the capkeeper doesn't stick. save your money, and keep the cap in your pocket."
2,It broke the 2nd day!,"I read the earlier review but bought it anyway-- it was worth the risk, and it attached fine for me. Unfortunately, the stick-on cap-keeper lost its stickiness and the cap dropped the first time I took it anywhere. Maybe it was just old. It's a great idea -- too bad it didn't work."
1,Don't buy this.,I couldn't help but laugh at the crappy-ness of this thing. Poorly designed with the short cord. Adhesive doesn't adhere very well... a piece of folded over scotch tape would have functioned better than whatever it is they used. Cap goes in the bag or pocket now.
4,"for the price, it does a great job",Works well on my 50mm Prime. It is not long enough for my 18-200mm. That is my only 'gripe'.
4,Good Halloween soundtrack!,"This collection has been in my CD library for close to twenty years now. I play it (usually skipping tracks 2,6 & 12) around Halloween time. The kids always get a good scare from it.01. Black Sabbath - 10/1002. The Wizard - 7/1003. Paranoid - 10/1004. War Pigs - 10/1005. Iron Man - 10/1006. Tomorrow's Dream - 5/1007. Fairies Wear Boots - 9/1008. Changes - 7/1009. Sweet Leaf - 9/1010. Children of the Grave - 10/1011. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath - 10/1012. Am I Going Insane - 3/1013. Snowblind - 9/1014. N.I.B. - 10/10Love live...BLACK SABBATH, DEEP PURPLE & THE TIJUANA BRASS!"
4,we sold our soul for rock and roll,This is the very best of Black Sabbath.The hard driving guitar and the Ozzies vocals are top notch.This is a must for true Sabbath maniacs like myself!
4,BLACK SABBATH,A GOOD RELEASE TO START WITH IF YOUR JUST GETTING INTO BLACK SABBATH.IT COVERS THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF THE BAND WITH OZZY WHILE THEY ARE AT THEIR PEAK.....
4,a solid sabbath collection,"This is a great collection of songs by a legendary band. I found it quite impressive because up until I had heard this, I had thought that sabbath were garbage. I had not heard any songs that I liked by them, until the very first song on here. Now Sabbath has some of my favorite songs, like Iron Man. This is classic old school metal/hard-rock."
3,they were much more,"Anyone who's a fan of Black Sabbath will know immediately upon looking at this track selection that many of their best songs haven't been included. I can see why this album is going for such a cheap price- you're only getting a small selection of Sabbath's best classic-period tracks. You really need to hear the bands first six albums to get the whole picture. Songs like ""Sabbra Cadabra"", ""Into the Void"", ""Megalomania"", ""Hole in the Sky"", ""Wicked World"", ""Looking for Today"", and ""A National Acrobat"". Those are Sabbath's best songs. This album only gives you the icing without the cake, and it's not even chocolate. It's not a good purchase."
4,THE BEST SONGS OF SABBATH!,"Classic tunes turned full blast is the only way to expierncethe true intensity of Black Sabbath. Best songs include ""PARANOID"" ""SABBATH BLODDY SABBATH"" ""WICKED WORLD""just to name a few All i can say this collection of great stuffis unforgettable and legendary still to this day. A must forany die-hard Black Sabbath Fan."
3,"EXCELLENT Musically, but not worthy of 5 stars","Musically speaking, this album is great. But for being a ""best of"" record, it is not that great. Sabbath had so many hits they could have easily had a double cd, but many great sabbath songs are left out"
4,A good way to start off with your Sabbath collection,"My only gripe is that the CD doesn't have enough songs like Electric Funeral, Into the Void, After Forever, Supernaut, Killing Yourself to Live, National Acrobat, Hole in the Sky and Symptom of the Universe (which was one of the last Black Sabbath classics with Ozzy).But the good news is that any metal fan can afford to have this Black Sabbath collection without having to spend a lot of money and I think that this is a good way to start off as being a Black Sabbath fan, also recommended are Master of Reality, Volume 4 and Symptom of the Universe 1970-78."
5,The Place to Start if you want to get into Sabbath,"It may not be anything special to a hardcore Sabbath fan, but if your new to the band and would like find a spot to start in their wide collection of albums We sold our souls for rock and roll is what your looking for! It contains all of Black Sabbath's most famous songs from 1970-1975. The only thing that could have been improved on this compilation Is perhaps a different song from Sabotage instead of Am I going Insane, The song really is out of place on the album."
3,Great CD...but,I used to own the double-album. Remember vinyl albums? Well the double album version had more songs than the CD so I'm giving it 3 stars even though all the songs deserve 5 stars.
4,Break some glass,This is truly a cd meant to be played very loud. It captures many of the great songs of the early Sabbath records and Ozzy in his prime.
3,We sold our soul for rock 'n' roll,I would like have a cover for the cd Black Sabbath We sold our soul for rock 'n' roll
1,DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!! :(,"When I was first getting into Black Sabbath, I was torn between getting all of the first six albums and getting this album. I made the right decision and got all of their albums. IF YOU WANT THE FULL SABBATH EXPERIENCE...GET ALL OF THEIR ALBUMS. This album is just missing too many excelent songs, like ""Laguna Sunrise"", ""Supernaut"", ""Behind The Wall Of Sleep"", ""After Forever"", ""Into The Void"", ""Wheels of Confusion"", ""Under the Sun"", and countless others. What it comes right down to is that Black Sabbath didn't release any songs that were less than excelent. In order to compile a ""Best of Black Sabbath"" album, you would end up combining every song from their first six albums. Don't be cheap, buy all of the Sabbath albums."
1,You can't make a greatest hits album for Sabbath!!!,How can'tou make a greatest hits album for Sabbath...every song they ever released was a hit. Especially the first 6 albums. Don't buy this album unless you can afford to buy the first 6.
3,Crazy Train,I know this orginal record probally pre dates crazy train or something but for anyone new to the band that song rocks reason for three stars i'm not into the whole satin thing this is true with other bands yes but black sabbath really took it where others didn't especially ozzy now i'm not saying this to be a dick and I resepct other peoples belifes forsure but I don't think they need to be in the music i'm a christian but I hate christian music so untalented for the most part anyway I still love the music for the insermentals and the songs that are not what I was talking about iron man being my fav song I do like metal becides new metal (linkin park can go to hell lol) but this band deep purple metallica GNR very good bands IMO
3,Folk! By First Six Black Sabbath CD's!,"This CD is supposely a collection of great black sabbath gems. On the surface, you may find Paranoid, Black Sabbath, War Pigs, and Iron Man. But, some of the good sabbath songs are not on this album.. The great sabbath tune such as Symtom of the Universe, Electric Funeral, and Psycho Man should be on the album. So, If you want to listen to all great sabbath songs, save some money to buy first six CD's.."
5,A MUST for potential Davidson goers,"This book is great: a comprehensive guide to all aspects of life at Davidson College, but also really easy to read. Provides an honest and indepth rating of school life, from academics to sports to the social scene- with hundreds of real quotes from students. A wonderful insight into this top-ranked liberal arts school."
2,"Yes, a Psych. yawner","Read the review ""A Psychological Yawner."" I almost put to down midway through. Won't say why. You'll see, if you read it. His book entitled The Deception was better. Aluring style. Story line a bit thin and ponderous. At the end I asked, ""So, what was the point now?"" The reviewer on the jacket, Ronald Kessler, says ""the closest most of us will ever get to being inside the war on terror."" Geeze, I hope it's going better than this! I hope."
4,I like them,"I admittedly don't use these often, but they seem to be made of very hard steel. The measurements are precise, and I like the length. I can get a lot of torque with these. I expect them to last my lifetime."
2,"TEKTON by MIT 4825 1/4-Inch Drive Deep Impact Socket Set, SAE, 9-Piece","TEKTON by MIT 4825 1/4-Inch Drive Deep Impact Socket Set, SAE, 9-PieceI was not happy with this set at all, The sockets were not even the same length in the set I received. Some of the socket's 1/4' drive holes were so big they fell off the extension.Returned them right away for refund. Surprised at the overall quality of this set.A thumbs down from me on this set.RagenRat :0("
1,A waste of money,"I purchased this to learn about Dachshunds, the sizes, coats, colors and temperaments. I didn't learn a thing. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
4,Holiday gift,"I'd give this book maybe 3.5 stars... don't be fooled by the female on the cover. Most of the drawings are of male figures. There did seem to be good information in the book, but for those who prefer to draw females, this book is not the best.This was a holiday gift for my brother (who is an adult). He has been enlarging and copying (by hand) Manga drawings for at least a year, and his work is beautiful. He just couldn't seem to make the leap to making up his own characters. I flipped through this book once it arrived, and thought it (along with 2 others I got him) would go a long way towards teaching him how to draw his own characters. I don't know how much overlap there is within this quite extensive series, but at least with these first few books there didn't seem to be much.When he got the books he praised them highly and he seems excited to put the new techniques to use."
4,Important book to have,"I think this book is reallyreally useful to have if you want to draw battles. Really useful. The only reason it doesn't earn it's last star is that the art is not really manga-style, and the fact that there are about three girls in the whole book...but if you know enough of drawing to be able to see the basic shape of the position, and draw it how you want it, then this book is an excellent buy! I love it and I use it all the time!!!!"
4,Great book.,"It is a good western and easy to read. It reads very fast. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes,western."
3,Western Romance/adventure,Unbelievable scenario and too wordy. Tarzan with a western twist. Could have been a lot worse but it passed the time.
3,Good reading,Its been a while since I have read a western and this one popped up when I did a search. It held my interest so much that I couldn't wait to get back to reading it. I highly recommend it to someone that wants a good book to read.
3,"OK story, but------","I liked the basic story, but the quality of the writing left a lot to be desired. Also, while entertaining, the hero's superhuman skills with primitive weapons and tools was more than a little too much. A good editor and a reasonably good proofreader would do wonders for this story."
4,Sage.brush,Great book reading it was like reading. Louis book booK. The way he describes. The country side it is like you are right there. Beautiful book.
1,Painfully Sophomoric,The authors writing style is painfully sophomoric. I honestly spent an hour trying to read this crap and even though the book was free I feel like I've been ripped off.
1,Sagebrush,Story lacked detail. It contained good life lessons on learning from nature. I felt the story was too spread out over the time period and pieces seemed to be missing
1,Don't waste your time with this book.,This writing is what I would expect from someone in middle school. I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. I can not recommend this book.
1,Great book.,I LIKED THE Book very much .It helt my attention. I would recommend it to anyone that likes westerns. Thank you .
2,welllll!!!!!,"Considering the authors lack of historical, survivalist, western or overall knowledge on the topics it is a story. Just glad that the commune started out with plenty of money so we had a happy ending."
3,good read,"Enjoyed this book, it has a lot of action .at times I thought I less there. Would recommend this book to all"
3,Writer needs work and proof reader,"The first part, upto the first visit to the tribe was good. Then it appeared as if it was a different writer. Lacked discription and unbelievable."
2,Average,Story interesting but a bit simple. Seemed to be intended for younger readers. Distracted by mispunctuations. Would not give to my brother as a gift.
4,sagebrush,"good story, very indepth, interesting reading, find a lot of these westerns are all based on the same theme good reading"
4,Sagebrush,The story was good. I had to get the sequel. Both wonderful stories. If western and survival is something you like you won't go wrong here.
4,Good Read,I think both the story and the writing were exceptional . Once started it was very hard to put down.
3,OK for Free,"If there is nothing else to read this is OK if simplistic. Certainly not close to being a Louis L'Amour book, but then this was free to download so I can't complain."
5,SageBrush,I really enjoyed this book it was very interesting and the story line was great. It was hard to put this book down i cant wait to read the follow up story.If you like westerns this book is well worth reading.
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book, but was sorely disappointed. The sentence structure was short and choppy and gave me the sense that I was reading a young adult book. This story has potential and had it been written by an historical romance novelist it might not have been so disappointing. There was room for improvement. I did not finish reading it."
2,Not very good,"Choppy writing style. Like it's meant for kids, yet the story is more appropriate for adults. Good story concept, except the Sage character can do no wrong. That got old fast. He is portrayed as a genius. smarter than everyone combined. Predictable story line too. No suspense whatsoever. Great little history lesson. That's the only reason I even finished the book."
4,Very good.,4 star rating. Would recommend to everyone. The story was well written and was clean of any objectionable language. Good book.
4,"Good, Fun Story",The story goes along at a good clip. It reminded me of the Love Comes Softly series tho without the religious undertones. I would recommend this book.
4,Sagebrush,"The Author shows promise as a good western writer. The main character was alittle to good to believe, but, The story line was good and I will read the sequel to see how the characters grow"
2,Sagebrush,"Overall, this was not a bad story, but - the author's writing style irritated me. Each sentence was terse, jerky and annoyingly simplistic. There were many characters to keep track of but the story was fundamentally simple and straightforward. Overall, it was disappointing, again mostly due to the writing style. I will probably avoid purchasing any other novels from this author if this is representative of his work. It does not get my recommendation."
2,Sagebrush,"At first I thought the basic story line was okay, but Sage/Michael was like McGyver of the Old West doing so many unbelievable things it got tedious. Add to it, too much repetition, short, choppy sentences and it was not an easy read. Descriptors were overdone and it was in need of an editor."
1,What just happened?,"I felt as if I was reading a story written by a twelve year old. Not only is the writing style rudimentary, but the verbiage was agonizingly bad. The plot was dismal. Talk about simple and completely unbelievable. Obviously this person never went through any sort of survival training, or extended camping trips. Truly a terrible reading experience for me."
1,What a waste!,"Poorly written with short, choppy sentences. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.Will stick with Johnson from now on. Don't bother unless you are a poor reader."
2,SOOOooo Long,Sagebrush is more of a childrens book than a true fictional western. The book gives you the feeling you are at the end and then starts another chapter !
2,Disappointed,I didn't really enjoy the book. It was alright but not a keeper for me. The story was interesting at times but got bogged down with details at times but the image of the hardships was vivid.
3,Sagebrush,"The early portion of the story line is good and meets what one looks for in a Western thyme but the overal presentation switches plot and seems to come up short as a result. The main character faced with all kinds of major challenges pushes all the right buttons throughout and is flawless in execuition, he is too good to be true. Climatic showdowns either become rushed through before properly culminating or became overdrawn to the point of loseing interest. I found the earlier portion of the read more interesting and than the later portion of the read as it held a higher degree of character focus and potential for a seamless story line."
4,Almost as good as William W. Johnstone,"This book is a good ""pleasure read"". After plowing through the ""heavier brain drainers"", it is fun to sit back and enjoy something lighter.I am a big fan of Johnstone and this book reminds me of his work.If you want to see the heroes kill fifty indians with a six-shooter, you will enjoy this book.I hope we see more."
3,old fashioned western,"Whilst some of the other reviewers are correct about the simplicity of the story telling and the rather non-believable parts of the story (his survival as a child in hostile indian territory, etc.) if you view this as an old fashioned western (the B&W movie kind, white hats = good guys, black hats = bad guys sort of thing) then this is readable and enjoyable. I must admit I would not pay for it, but as a free book it was fun."
3,Western Snob,"Yes, I am a western snob. I've read every book I can get my hands on that Louis L'Amour wrote and I judge other westerns based on his writings. I seldom find an author I can read and enjoy as much as Mr. L'Amour's works but this one at least has been good enough for me not to delete it from my Kindle. Believe me, that is praise coming from a Western Snob."
4,Pretty good DVD,The old woman narrating it is the only down side. She likes the sound of her own voice too much. It gets annoying.
3,Rare stuff; acceptable quality,"ten rare vintage Fleischer cartoons are presented - only five feature Gabby, the character from Gulliver's Travels (1939). These came from 16mm prints which are generally in top shape with minimal splices, lines and dirt. Color and sharpness are pretty good. One or two cartoons have the UM&M TV reissue titles, while the other ""original"" titles have been letterboxed to obliterate the names Paramount and Technicolor (as they weren't involved in the reissuing of the 16mm prints). Goodtimes has several Fleischer / Famous Studios cartoon collections out. The header on the boxes announces that the subjects have been digitally remastered (can't make a DVD any other way, fellahs). The sound effects on some of the cartoons have been enhanced, but the crispy new effects are jarring and out of place against the rest of the vintage audio on the sound tracks. Not so bad here, but over done on the Goodtimes Gulliver's Travels. Get the Winstar Gulliver instead."
2,Not impressed,"I would give this a better rating if mine hadn't died. I didn't realize it would be so root bound by the time it got to me and when I realized what was wrong with it, it was too late. No amount of TLC after repotting could save it. SO... if you buy it, yank it out of it's pot (careful, they use some thick sharp wires to hold it in place) and place it in a large container and allow it to grow out a bit. BE WARNED since it doesn't come with one."
1,too expensive for what u get,"If you do not live somewhere where there is sun everyday of the year, do not get it. 1 day after it arrived, most of the leaves feel out. it was supposed to be a Christmas present and since most of leaves feel out we could not give it away. it was pathetic. it is definitely not worth 60 dollars.we really regret buying this plant."
2,Christmas gift that came alive,"This was a christmas gift for a dear friend. It arrived well packed and as described...but then small flying bugs (gnats?) started to emerge, they have been coming alive for days now and nothing seems to stop them! Friend asked Amazon for an exchange...sorry no exchanges, if you return it we will refund the money!!! It was a gift!"
4,Just a few minor points (but a lovely piece).,"This really is an excellent album - I agree with past reviews of conflicting viewpoints. That is, it certainly sits well within the Little Feat canon and it is also very much outside of what I expected. Sleek backing vocals and brass arrangements as opposed to swamp funk across which Lowell is sliding his way to heaven. All said and done, love it. However, really had to let others know that 'Himmler's Ring' is a Jimmy Webb composition and as most would know, 'Can't stand the rain' is a Peebles song (and composition). There are only two fresh Lowell originals on the album (outside of Two Trains) and these are both co-compositions. The stunning '20 million things' with McGuinn (and temporarily Dylan) co-writer Jaques Levy and 'Cheek to Cheek' with Van Dyke Parks. Other tracks include compositions by Touissant and Fred Tackett. End o' the day, a lovely listen."
4,Lowell,"When Little Feat started exploring more jazz like roads, LG decided he needed to put out a record that was closer to his original vision and more personal. There's plenty of band help here and a couple of LF tunes too, but for the most part this was NOT a Little Feat album and you're either gonna love it or hate it based on how much you consider Lowell George the genius he was. Even if he had lived, most likely he would have eventually left the band anyway. I always loved the oddball edge of this album and still own it in the original vinyl."
4,German on the Road 2: A nice way to get there.,"I'm sorry to find that this title is out of print. I listened to a copy from my local library and found it useful for reviewing intermediate level German conversation.This is what I like about it:1. It has a narrative structure: it follows one particular tourist on a plausible tour of Germany. It's not a collection of unconnected sentences as some basic level tapes are.2. It presents the German sentence first in context, then immediately gives an English paraphrase.3. It repeats material, and then quizzes you on it.4. There's a variety of voices on the tape, so it doesn't get monotonous.5. As the title suggests, you can listen to it in your car without having to refer to the accompanying phrasebook.It's too bad there's not a Level 3, too."
2,Not a quality product.,I was so disappointed with this item! It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for a fossil-loving friend. It looked like a necklace from a 50 cent machine. I had to get her a new gift.
3,"Move over Tom, Micheal is in charge....","Livin on the Fault line was the album that said to me, this is no longer Tom Johnston or Patrick Simmons band. It is Micheal McDonalds. His songs were the hits, he steered the ship now. I think all great bands change and evolve. McDonalds Steely Dan training was pushing him to try the jazz fused pop that Livin on the Fault line gave us. I personally liked the album. Highlights are Echos of Love and Your made that way. There is an excellent instrumental called Chinatown. If all you know of the Doobs is China Grove, Black Water, and Listen to the Music, you owe it to your self to check this one out."
3,No more Johnston,"Although Tom Johnston is shown in this album's group picture, he is generally -- perhaps entirely -- absent from the music. LIVING ON THE FAULT LINE is so short mainly because Johnston took all his songs and left. Overall, this is a fairly average Doobies album. It's one of the few that doesn't contain any of my great Doobies favorites. Of what it does include, I like ""You're Made That Way"" and ""Nothin' But A Heartache"" best, and ""Need A Lady"" is fun. But I find the ""hits"" (""Little Darlin'"", ""Echoes Of Love"", ""You Belong To Me"") rather dull. I'm impressed by the title track and ""Chinatown"" more for what they could have been than what they actually are -- they're each about 5 minutes long, yet they leave me feeling like there should have been more to them. Finally, the throwaway instrumental ""Larry The Logger Two-Step"" sounds to me like it should be playing while the credits roll!"
3,Uneven set from 1947,"The title is a severe misnomer. How can any recording purport to be an artist's ""greatest hits"" when it only covers material from a short fragment (1947-50) of his career?Having said that, however, the disc is not a total waste of time. It mostly features the vocals of Jimmy Rushing, who wails away plaintively on tracks such as ""Brand New Wagon"", ""If You See My Baby"" and ""Hey, Pretty Baby"", which are entertaining. My favorite is ""After You've Gone"", mostly for the fabulous horn break in the middle. That is the type of arrangement Basie is noted for (and we'd see much more of that later in the 1950's), but there's just too little of it here.An OK outing, but not worth your time if you want a well-rounded Count Basie set."
5,A perfect cd,"Ben Lee's new album is absolutely worth buying, even if you've never heard it. If you like pop, this will be your new favorite cd. The cd contains both upbeat (catch my disease) and more melancholy (begin) tunes, but each song is sure to inspire you. There will always be one song on this album that you can relate to at any moment in time.my favorites are:""We're All in This Together""""Close I've Come""""Gamble Everything for Love""and according to my brother who has booked Ben Lee, he's a real nice guy. Buy his album. you won't regret it."
5,One of my better records Ben lee By Awake is the new Sleep,"Arcord of being dumped ordinary prie be a bad thing,but with Claire Danes Delivery on pop songs that are catchy makes this a good record this is half the record that other artist thrive to corner T ARE MID-TEMPO SONGS IT,S A GOOD REALEASE YOU SHOULD PICK THIS ONE UP."
5,"oh, my goodness. this is the way i like it.","let me tell you, my addiction happens to be buying cds, so i go through a lot of money and PLENTY of music. but this is by far the best cd i've bought all year. the lyrics will blow you away- ben lee has a bunch of previous cds, but (correct me if i'm wrong) he went to africa... or something just moved him... and that's what inspired him to write this cd, so the lyrics are really fresh and engaging. they just make you want to think. ""catch my disease"" is, in my opinion, the best song on the cd, but ""begin"" and ""whatever it is"" are both gorgeous.""i'm thinking about the city, it's living proof that people need to be together..."" it's lyrics like that that just make me smile. a good cd should be able to make you look at the world in a completely new perspective, and this cd does that and will just make you so, so happy.this is the best 14 dollars you will ever spend. definitely, definitely buy."
4,Need something to chill to? This is it!,"Came across track 12 by chance and then tracked down this album - fantastic! Loses it a bit, in my opinion, on track 13 but the rest of the album is faultless! Smashing!"
4,A gem,Ben Lee refreshes the listener with one-of-a-kind upbeat and positive music. I recommend listening to everything this artist produces: he should continue to surprise and delight us for years to come with each new album he creates.
4,Won me over quickly,This is an all around great CD. I love his voice and the lyrics. Tracks 4 and 7 are my favorite. There are only a couple songs on here that I don't totally love.
2,i ordered this...,"ok, it's my fault. i ordered it and i'm not asking for my money back.there are some very intelligent reviews posted for this cd, and i'm not knocking their opinions or tastes. but i can advise you to listen to *every* sound bite before you order this.the problem, for me, is that ben lee has some good riffs and occassionally very catchy lyrics. i expected more energy and less moodiness. he might be fun to catch at a a (small) local venue. but it's not a cd i will listen to much more than the 2-3 times it's worth to me."
5,Reiki The Healing Touch,This book is excellent for use in conjunction with taking Reiki 1 and 2 course lessons. The spiral bound version is perfect for referring to when giving Reiki healing as it opens out flat (and stays flat!!).
5,Excellent guide for students,"William Rand is an excellent Reiki Teacher, here is a great source of information for students. I suggest this book along with a few others to broaden one's education."
1,Discrepancies and falsehoods,"Page after page contains discrepancies and falsehoods. Eager doesn't seem to know the difference between C rations and K rations, for example. But he does say he arrived in Vietnam on Feb. 9, 1968, and he names a number of men killed in his unit. Unfortunately for him, members of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade Association have a complete list of 196th LIB members who were killed in Vietnam. Eager's KIA names do not match those on the list.I read 96 pages before Eager's fascination with torture, murder and mutilation sickened me and made me put the book down. If you want a provocative book about Vietnam, read ""Stolen Valor"" by B.G. Burkett, Glenna Whitley. Heavily documented, the book tells how and why hundreds of frauds have posed as Vietnam veterans to gain attention, money, special treatment in prison, and VA disability payments."
1,Better not buy this book,I wish I had known what foul language was used in this book.!!!...I needed it for informational material and sure would not want kids to see this one. I've read alot of material on Vietnam and most of it was very very mild compared to this....I feel so sorry for this guy and I prayed for him...... We just need to know the rating of this material when we purchase it.......I wondered why it had a public library stamped on it too....the mailer was prompt and all.....no problems there....
2,I paid $24 for this...?!,"First of all, this ""house"" is incredibly small. Only a small kitten would not feel cramped when going inside. I feel bad for the cat pictured on the box looking through the little window in the back.Second, the setup isn't that easy. It's not extraordinarily difficult, but it takes a while! The hooks don't go in right, they don't attach to the walls like they should, and the walls fall out after a while if they're not being held! The roof too. You'll probably need more than one person for this setup if you're still going to buy it.I give it more than one star because it's pretty and probably comfortable for the cats."
1,Save Your Money & Don't Buy,"The photo of the product online is quite deceptive! The Cozy Kingdom photo makes it look stable, well-constructed and large enough for a normal size cat. In reality, the Cozy Kingdom is anything but. It is basically cardboard and cheap thin plastic. And some of the plastic grooves that needed to be snapped into place arrived broken. No instructions were included, and assembling this piece of garbage took me about 2 hours. I had 2 friends also try to assemble the ""Kingdom,"" but the pieces wouldnt fit together as they were supposed to! The Kingdom would NOT securely snap all together.We got it ""somewhat"" put together and realized that even if we could've gotten it properly assembled, it would have only held a kitten under 3 lbs. Spend a few more bucks, go to regular pet store and buy your cat a real cat condo already assembled and not out of pieces of cardboard and cheap plastic!"
4,Kitty house is very cute,My kitty loved this little house. He wasn't a particularly tiny cat. He would sit in the house facing the doorway and watch his surroundings in the feeling of comfort. My only regret is that he didn't get to enjoy it for longer - he passed away after only having the house for a couple of weeks (Sly died at the tender age of 12.5 years).
4,Amazing depth; a vivid portrayal of the early church,"This book presents a real and vivid early church to readers. No waxwork figures here! The breadth and depth of the portrayal of life in those ancient times rivals the scope of classics like BEN-HUR and THE ROBE.At times the narrative suffers from ""overwriting"" (a common problem in Evangelical Christian fiction), but Perpetua's path to martyrdom challenges, enlightens, encourages, and awakens the Christian reader. You see a real person here, and by the end of the book, I found myself bringing my faith to God in prayer, wanting to be stronger in the cause of Christ. A truly worthy read!---Jeri Massi"
2,Awkward Feeder Problem,"Yes this machine shreds, and cross cuts too, at the same time, BUT ----- the feeder is awkward so that you will find yourself re-feeding the same stack of sheets several times. I imagine the problem is with a safety feature that prevents you from accidentally feeding your fingers into the blades, but the result of this feature is that the papers need to be fed at a very particular angle and they easily get jammed against the back of the machine rather than going into the jaws of death."
5,"Great product, works as advertised","I had a big attic-cleanup job facing me--30 years worth of accumulated paper documents, receipts, phone bills, cancelled checks, etc. This workhorse turned it all into confetti without experiencing a single paper jam. It could run almost continuously without having to cool off, and the CD/credit card slot is especially helpful even for thick wads of paper."
5,Best one I've owned -- Still great after 5 1/2 years!,"This is the third shredder that I've owned. I've been using this for about five and a half years (bought it for $125 in 2006).The others were not very durable, couldn't handle many pages at once, and basically were a disappointment. This one has met, and exceeded, expectations. Just wonderful.Not only can it handle many pages at once, but it doesn't mind staples (a convenience that you don't have to pick them out). Further, it can handle credit cards and CD-ROMs elegantly as well.The only problem that I've ever had with it was a few years back, I think it started squeaking. I diagnosed it as needing some oil. So I gave it a liberal amount of shredder oil and it was good to go.I am 100% satisfied with this purchase."
1,Mine Broke After a Week!,We had this unit for about a week before it wouldn't turn off. It's a pain to turn it on when you have to shread something and have to turn the machine off when you are done. It works fine in reverse but that really serves no purpose. I have heard of other people having this problem also.
5,Great,"It has plenty of power, eats some junk mail un-opened. I like the bin size and shape. It really eats paper!!!!. It does not jam with labels like some other units I've had"
5,"shredder is fine, but why the oil?","The shredder is fine and it came really fast, but this Royal doesn't need the Fellowes oil that is recommended. Manual says do not use Petroleum-based lubricants."
5,Heavy Shredding,"We burned up two light office shredders before we bought this one. Great heavy duty shredder. Used it to shred estate papers where absolutely nothing was thrown out. It's cycle time was very good for about 8-10 pieces of paper and kept up continuously as we reviewed and inserted those papers needing shredding.When the large basket was full we slid it out, easily emptied it from the trash bag inside basket to the trash without leaving shreds (strips) all over, then took a break and re-inserted the basket with trash bag and inserted/shredded a page sprayed with vegetable (PAM) oil. It shredded about 10 two foot storage boxes of papers without any delays from overheating. This went on over various periods for several months without ever stopping or signs of wear.It is larger than the the typical light office shredders from box stores, but has rollers making it easy to move to work area. More expensive than light office shredder, but great value for personal heavy duty shredding."
4,Shredder,"This is a unit I purchased to replace a 12 sheet shredder that jammed up shredding a cd. This one so far has chewed up anything I have put into it. the ""bin full"" warning is a good feature. A good solid unit for a home office."
2,Royal 16 Sheet Schredder,No straight pass through to shred paper.Make a lot of noise when shredding.Sounds like it is laboring just to shred 3 pages.
1,Royal paper shredder not a very good shredder,whether I'm inserting 2 sheets or 10 sheets. The product spends more time beeping than shredding. It does nothing but beep. Hard to feed and A total piece of crap
1,Comes With Ad That Cannot Be Removed,"Some genius decided to affix a paper ad to the front of this machine with permanent glue that cannot be removed without an hour of scrapping, leaving a scratched and marred front. It's too bad that Royal let such a stupid problem infect what I am willing to assume is a well designed machine. By the way, calling the Royal consumer service line gets you to a completely useless person in India."
3,For Francophiles,"This is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in French culture or language. The second half in particular provides useful language titbits and insights into French intellectual history of the postwar period as well as the mysteries of the literary method of deconstruction. As a Francophile and someone who has studied French for many years, I was very impressed with the author's dedication and level of mastery."
2,French Lessons; a memoir,"This was a strange book, one that made me wonder why it was written - or at least why it was published. It starts off with the author's early life (as one might expect), and moves on to her study of French language. Indeed it appears this became a bit of an obsession with her; to speak (perfect) French, AND be perfectly French. Indeed she suggests she almost became an alien in America. All this is fair enough, but along the way the author wanders off into discussions of the minutiae of French grammar, pronunciation (and just where exactly the intonations sit in the sound production process).Perhaps all very interesting - but in another context. Here, in a ""memoir"", it is seemingly irrelevant prattle. I did persist to the end, but ultimately I felt I knew very little about the author and what motivates her."
1,Not what I ordered,It is advertised as compatible with the 20 GB ipod. This is not true in my case. It is totally useless to me.
1,This album sucks,"I loved ""Harlem World"" and his other work. Double Up was o.k. This album is barely passable. I won't be listening to it again. I'd say spend your money on some old school Bad Boy and leave this one out."
4,Welcome back,"Welcome back Mase. Why you tried to send the message that your still a gangster after ten years of preaching is beyond me. You also sent the message that money can make a person give up religion but hey whatever. Critcism aside this was a decent album that showed why Mase was a loved artist when he was at his peak, it was lacking in some of his old swagger but it was still a decent album."
1,Mase: The Double-Minded Deceiver!,"Mason Betha is a double-minded deceiver. How can you spit gangsta lyrics with G-Unit and then pretend to pastor a church for God? Either you're a street thug or a servant of Light, but definitely not both! Mase quit deceiving young people by being a fake preacher. You are leading many little ones astray, and God will not be mocked in the end! This duplicitous life that your living just isn't right. As the Bible says, ""A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways."" For now, Mase that describes you!"
4,"Not your traditional ""Americanized"" novel","Had to read this for a class. It is a realy good book, but do not dive into it expecting it to be written like all of the American novels we might be used to."
2,Must be on a short model,"This Models Coat is shorter than it appears in the picture. I am only 5'4"" and the coat came only to about mid-shin on me, not almost ankle length as pictured. I am returning it for that reason although the fabric was not very quality either."
4,"Kind of good, come on Bootzilla","This 1977 album, Ah The Name Is Bootsy is good but, a little more songs. Munchies For Your Love, Telephone Bill, and Can't Stay Away are great songs on this cd. Bootsy's Space Bass was sounding sweet. Munchies and Name is bootsy has the most space sounds.1. Ah the name is bootsy: Great and Outstanding2. Pinocchio Theory: Funny Singalong, Great funk3.Rubber Duckie: Disco, this tune was scary4. Side Two Preview: Could be sampled? right.5. Telephone Bill: 1# favorite6. Munchies: 2# favorite, can do better with love song7. Can't Stay Away: Sounds like Sly Stone's sound8.Reprise: This is Junk. Do it again"
5,"Yo' Bootsy, let me borrow ya spaceship, I'll bring it right back!","This man along with the Funk Master George Clinton single handedly changed the way I looked at music in my younger years.They created a concept and an imaginary world where funky music was fun.George Clinton and Bootsy Collins R the undeniable tag team of funk in its most purest form.This CD is Bootsy's coolest one to date.From the CD cover to the songs on the project,...U can just feel the era of funk that rocked us all back then.I'm definitely a Rubber Fan for life."
2,Not same as picture on manufacturer web site.,Make sure that you do not get fooled by the photo on the manufacturer's web site.http://www.delseycamerabags.com/view_product.php?productid=16The bag is not the same. The front compartment does not exsist and the front oppening is also different.The picture on Amazon and Adorama is the correct one.
5,Get this CD,"What a great album!!! This is how music is supposed to sound, the harmonies are wonderful and the joy is apparent. What they don't tell you is that the CD has the original ""Butternut Hill"". This song was missing after the first pressing due to legal action. I'm glad to see that today we have come a long way. If you are a Chicagoian, or even if you are not, get this album to remember the good old days. The only downside; the print on the original liner notes is too small to read for those of us who remember this wonderful duo."
4,"Great, but not the original","Camp and Gibson are all that the other reviewers say, BUT it not the original LP recording. I was at the original recording and the difference is the bass player Ray Brown. The originals tapes were lost/destroyed. The CD is a re-performance with the same..complete with same jokes. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to have the same energy level either. Still a good CD but lot's of luck to you die hards in finding the original LP recording. I still prefer listening to it..even with the scratches."
5,You Can't Beat God Giving,"Juanita Bynum is a truly anointed prophetess sent by God. I have seen her in person and she eletrifies the audience with her presence. The planted seed was a wonderful book. It backs up what the bible tell us about giving. Give and it shall be given unto you. The principals are so simple. If you think about it, what if God said give me 90% and you take 10%, we really would have a hard time. All we need to do it honour God with our substance, and He will keep His promise to us. The more you give the more He'll give to you, just keep on giving because it is really true, that you can't beat God giving, No matter how you try. I'm a witness to this principal. Get the book and meditate on it."
2,A old Oral Roberts rip off of the poor,"A one star book. Why don't they the rich evangelist sow to us ( the poor )for a change and realy get blessed. This is a con job made in hell, and when it dont work out people LOSE faith in God. Dont fall for the old testament promise for Israel for what God has for the Church sermons. Bad teaching all the way."
2,Poor quality,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now. They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it. However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors. Also the sound is very bad. Some of the plots are a little boring. But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality. I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't. I just wish it was easier to watch."
4,Threadcutting in the Lathe,While grounded in the practical methods for cutting single and multiple lead threads it also makes the theory and math involved in determining change gears need for non-standard threads understandable. As a plus it explains what is required in plain language to modify one's own lathe to use some of the bag of tricks high end tool room lathes use when cutting threads by the practical experience modifying his own Myford. Well worth the money for the person with a metal working shop at home.
4,It is exactly what it says it is.,It is the only book I have found dedicated to the important practice of screwcutting on a lathe. Most of the subject matter is very clear and well written for both the novice as well as a journeyman. I gave it a 4 of 5 only because I think there should have been more detail. But given that it is the only book dedicated to the subject; it has a whole lot more detail than anything else on this subject.
2,Four Wheelin' for Dummies,"No really, I think I am dummer for having watched this video. Fortunately I didn't pay full price for it and just rented it. It's titled 4 Wheeling Basics and it's just that, BASIC. If you own, or have ever owned, a four wheel drive vehilce of any type you already know more than you'll learn in this video."
2,Disappointing,"I have books that explain the basics. I was hoping this video will SHOW those concepts and mix it up with some exciting 4 wheeling examples. Not so...The video is mostly in a class room with some poorly edited short outdoor video segments. It is pretty short video for the $24 price tag. I did get couple of helpful pointers from the video, however so that is why I gave it a two star."
5,Excellant Teacher resource,I am an art teacher and have been looking for a comprehensive text on creating books that reflect creativity. Non-Adhesive Binding has given me a great resource for my classroom as well as my personal work.
4,"Craftsmanship over ""arty""","If you love attention to detail and quality finishes then this is the book for you. The focus is on the craftsmanship of bookbinding over artfulness. However Smith does suggest ""arty"" adaptations via photographs of one off creations by artists. A good book for advanced bookbinders."
3,playtime with periwinkle,I received the dvd pretty quickly. it is good condition and plays well. iI would order from the seller again...........
4,A good starting point,"When I first started reading the book, the concepts seemed extremely easy. However, the book quickly gets into more in-depth material (in an odd order, however). Be sure to follow along in the program while reading for maximum effectiveness. Recommended for anyone who has not used Sonar."
4,Perfect (but not for running),"Super comfortable shorts! Deep pockets so stuff stays in, length is perfect... long enough not to be nerdy, short enough not to be ridiculous.Would have gotten 5 stars except for long runs they always ride up in the crotch, so I only wear these for lounging and sports like basketball. Long distance running, definitely not!My favorie thing to wear around the house!"
2,Very comfortable but over priced!,"Not much else to say here, they arrived quickly and all, but I just don't see why Under Armour is SO expensive! Nike and Champs make shorts (and everything else) that are just as good but half the price."
3,IDK,"These were ok, but they rode up the crotch to much. So not highily reccomended unless u want something to crawl up your crotch."
4,Portugal sailing across the world in early history,Great soft covered book with pictures of original documents. Lots of pictures of shipping items and natives etc.. Very compact little book filled with lots of facts about Portugal sailing and trades.
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!,"I gave this CD a few listens, now I'm ready to throw it in the garbage.The whole CD sounds so sterile and his band is horrible and amateurish.I have been a huge Squeeze fan since 1981 and my advice to Mr. Tilbrook is.....either reform Squeeze or retire from the music business!!!!"
3,OK,"This is a reasonable CD but once you listen to it you may get the impression that Glenn is trying a bit too hard to sound like Paul McCartney. If you can put that aside I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I did.I came across him whilst at a Steve Poltz concert. Steve spoke about the song title game that he, Glenn and Bob Schneider played whilst on tour. I decided to explore their music and was not too disappointed. Glenn Tilbrook is a good song writer and well worth a listen. As are Steve Poltz and Bob Schneider. Their sense of humour is far more refreshing than all of the top 40 stuff put together. Explore it at your leisure, you won't be upset."
5,Glenn Tilbrook's fresh new CD,"Glenn Tilbrook's new solo album is filled with fun and fresh music. From mellow to silly music-his beautiful melodic voice and talented guitar playing-make every track a winner in my book. If you love Squeeze, you most assuredly love Glenn Tilbrook-I definitely recommend picking this one up!"
5,The best Fleetwood Mac album ever.....,"This is the best Fleetwood Mac album ever. I've got no doubt. I listened this album many times and I like it more and more every audition. Congratulations for everybody form the band ( Lindsey Buckinghan, Stevie Nicks, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and the ""perfect"" Christine McVie.) This is the Fleetwood Mac's Sgt. Pepper's, or the Fleetwood Mac's Fragile (Yes), it's complete and lovely."
5,The Best Album of All-Time,"""Rumours"" is an astonishing collection of well-written songs about drama, passion, and music. Until the album, ""Fleetwood Mac,"" Fleetwood Mac was a blues group. ""Fleetwood Mac"" and ""Rumours,"" two classic albums transformed them into the biggest group of the decade. Because of this album, the previous album, and the album after it, Fleetwood Mac would be considered the greatest group of the late seventies, and it is rightfully so."
3,Overrated,This is not a bad album nor a masterpiece either. The fact that it sold millions of copies doesn't make it less overrated.Fave song - Gold Dust Woman.Least liked song - Don't Stop.3/5.
4,beautiful child,"so many years later, a very interesting piece of music, in relistening i find the bass line and rhythm sections excellent, and the vocal harmonies to be quite interesting, so what went around came around, and a great production effort amidst the other albums of the late 70s, im most impressed with christines talent, and spent most of last night and this morning enjoying"
5,outstanding,"as i sit, listening to this album, i'm immediately cocooned in the struggle of the feelings surrounding lost love. the songs on this CD hold you, drain you, move you. after 30 years, it still possesses the power to bring me back to the original struggles i experienced in losing my first love and finding myself, or, at least, finding ""not myself"". this CD brings you back to the 70s and all that came with it. fantastic classic piece!!!"
5,Love this album,"I don't know if I love this album because it takes me back to my childhood one summer when we played this non-stop on a camping trip (On an 8-track no less), or if it's just that good. I can listen to the songs over and over again and not tire of them. I think each song stands on its own and showcases the talent of each member of Fleetwood Mac. I think Christine McVie's voice is just beautiful and her performance of ""Songbird"" is one of the highlights of this album for me.If you want good, solid songs for listening anytime and in any mood, this album is for you."
5,Let's keep it in perspective!,"Fleetwood Mac's Rumors is about as good an album as you could hope to find, especially in the musically barron mid 70's. It is very hard to find a flaw in the recording, although I recently learned that the song ""Silver Springs"" was omitted from this album in favor of ""I don't want to know"". Quite an editorial error, I would say. I am reviewing this however, because after reading many of the existing reviews, I am appalled to find comparisons of Fleetwood Mac to the Beatles. GIVE ME A BREAK! Fleetwood Mac is excellent, but there are maybe three bands in the world that belong in the same class with the Beatles and sorry, the Mac aint one of them."
5,A classic rock MUST-HAVE!!!!,"I remember this album came out when I was still in junior high. I loved every song then, but love them more now!!"
5,Stands the Test of Time,Every single song is a hit in my opinion. One of those enduring classics and a must have for any rock fan. Stevie Nicks has an incredible voice. My faves are The Chain and Never Going Back Again.
5,Gets better with age,"I bought the DVD Audio version, created by Fleetwood Mac's old engineer Ken Caillat. He did an excellent job tweaking the songs, and the songs really shine in this format.As for the album itself, it does not sound dated, despite the fact that we've heard the songs on the radio for the past 30 years. Later Mac albums suffer from overproduction, which give them a definite '80s feel, but Rumours escaped this fate. Okay, the harmonies are a bit California '70s, but they're beautiful, so who cares? Heartfelt, authentic music so rarely made these days."
5,Flleetwood Mac Rumours,"Brilliant, Emma & I already have the CD just wanted the album as a collectors piece best songs they ever didBarry & Emma"
3,Classic,This album is a classic. I think it is one of the Top 100 must own albums of all times. It is almost a greatest hits album all by itself.
1,"""Deluxe"" edition? No, it's not. Just ANOTHER compact disc.","I much prefer my original vinyl over this crap. I am SO tired and fed-up with seeing ""Deluxe Editions"" being released and only two that I know of include an SACD (Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery is phenomenal!!). Why just release yet another CD? It's not like there's a lack of them!!I just don't get it.Music companies have NO idea how to run a business and give people what they want. And they do not monitor or audition recordings before they are released. That is painfully obvious.Just because a person has a ""name"" in the business.... does NOT indicate quality."
5,Key part of any collection,"Apparently recorded when the band weren't getting along, 'Rumours' is such a masterpiece that you wouldn't have guessed. Such is the display of brilliant songwriting, it's no surprise that 'Rumours'is a famous album.My favourites are more the album tracks than the singles including 'Old Dustwoman', 'Chains', 'Oh Daddy' and the beautiful 'Never Going back Again'.I originally purchased this album on cassette when I was. The cassette eventually fell apart from extensive use, and was replaced by a second hand vinyl. I now own a much treasured CD of Rumours. The vinyl was passed to my older sister who rates it as one of her top ten albums of all time.Most people will be familiar with 'Rumours' as many tracks were lifted as singles including 'Dreams', 'You Make Loving Fun', 'Go Your Own Way' and the incredible 'Don't Stop'.Add it to your collection today, and enjoy."
5,A pleasant surprise,"I was surprised to find that of my DVD-A purchases, this album was among those that benefited most from the new format. The multiple channels were used to great effect and added strong new dimensionality to the music. Not among my favorite albums, but among my favorite DVD-A's. A great listening experience."
5,Rumours,"A hard-core jazz fan from the Bop era, I'll make an exception for this amount of rock. In fact, Rumours, The Dance and The Best Of have aged extremely well."
4,THE archetypical 70's album!,"A great album for anyone and eveyone, which truly captures the essence of not only the 70's but Fleetwood Mac itself falling apart at the seems. Great songs such as ""Go Your Own Way"" and ""The Chain"" make this a must for any record collection!"
5,GREAT!!!!,"I really havn't listened to Fleetwood mac before this album som I'm not familiar with the stuff before the girls entered the group.Anyway, I just love this album. It contains songs with great lyrics and ""sing along tunes"". I've reccomended it to many of my friends with different taste in music an they've all loved it. It's music to play in your car, at a party or just when youre hanging out. Very easy listening but still very interesting.i don't relly know what to compare it with but I'm sure that you will not regret it if you purchased this album."
1,Awful!,"This album is garbage. Bloated and banal, it is a classic example of how bad popular music (created by dope-addled 1960s leftovers) became in the second half of the seventies. Thank goodness the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Clash came along to save us from this tripe. The album is over produced - listen again to ""Go Your Own Way."" The very sound of the guitars is annoying. Stevie Nicks' purring vocals (on ""Dreams,"" for instance) are sickeningly cloying. The lyrics are embarrassingly mediocre, i.e. ""Don't Stop Thinking About Tommorrow/It Will Soon Be Here."" The music has no passion. Even the cover art is affected. Can you believe they carpeted the planet with this in '77? This ain't what rock 'n roll was meant to be."
1,I don't think so...,"Hmmm...Let's see...22 years later and the band of such talented musicians had no alternative but to get together and rehash former success to feed themselves. This album is so unimportant I'm not sure why I even feel the need to write this. Not even from the comparison standpoint, because The Beatles are nothing like Fleetwood Mac (thank god). I just can't think of anything this album influenced. Now you know...;)"
1,Mega WTF!,"I listened to this album, and my eardrums popped. Stevie Nicks' vocals are so high, he sounds like a girl. Seriously, sing like a man, like Chad Kroeger from Nickelback.Oh, and another thing wrong with this album is that there is no 'U' in 'Rumors.'"
4,rumours - dvd audio version,"I've never been a big Fleetwood Mac fan, in fact until now, I've never owned this album, but it's a must have on DVD audio. It sounds fantastic in this new format. Sounds like they are playing live in your living room. If you don't own a dvd audio player, you should run out right now and buy one! This new format is incredible!"
5,Not a weak song in the house,"Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"" stands on its own strength. That strength is a continuation of strong tracks from start to finish. There's not a weak song in the house. Reminiscent of ""Sgt. Pepper"", Rumours captivates the listener from start to finish and is a pleasurable music experience."
5,Exceptional,"This Album is a step above the rest. Every song is catchy and easy to listen to. Best Fleetwood Mac ever. Should have been named FM's ""All time greatest hits"""
3,Rumours RE-visited,"I had heard that this DVD audio version of the Mac's ""Rumours"" LP/CD was the only way to hear it. It came at a steep price as well! After giving it a few spins I can say that it is interesting to listen to it in surround on my McIntosh / JBL Project Array Synthesis home theatre system. I just don't think it's worth the high price as in some ways it sounds rather odd. Just MHO you understand. This is an album I've enjoyed since it's release many moons ago. In this version the sound is broken down into the seven channels of the theatre system. While you can now hear each instrument more isolated than ever, and if your trying to learn to play a part this will help. I did enjoy it, but not more than the original LP that originally came out when it was first releasted. That's all I can say about it. Thank you for your time."
5,One Of Fleetwood Mac's Very Best Albums,"""Rumours"" is definitely a masterpiece and one of the very best works that Fleetwood Mac ever created. All of the songs are excellent and all could be considered hits. This is definitely a must-have Fleetwood Mac album, one of the essentials. I love it!"
2,Great CD but not so great DVD Audio,"I have nothing against the music of Rumours -- it's certainly a classic Fleetwood Mac composition. However, this DVD Audio does not give a significant audio improvement over the CD version. Since DVD Audios cost more than CDs, I would go with the CD instead. Although I don't know all the details that go into making a DVD Audio, I would think the quality issue would be influenced similarly to AAD vs. ADD vs. DDD on CDs. Old albums that were recorded analog that later get converted to digital for CDs never sound as good as those that were recorded digitally. I suspect this is why Rumours did not really show any superiority over the CD."
1,Like if my Mom formed a band,"If my Mom and the other suburban parents formed a band it would be about as cool as Fleetwood Mac. Suburban rock for people born, raised and can't imagine any other life than in the suburbs."
1,Beware: DVD video players,"This is the only DVD my player hasn't been able to access (of course I tried a 2nd copy). I do not have a DVD-audio player; however, I can access the Dolby Digital track on all other DVD-audios. This DVD just sits in my player with ""loading"" blinking at me.I have a Toshiba 2109... still waiting to hear back from Toshiba customer service on this issue and can't find anyone to contact at WB about the disc."
1,An Early Mac Fan,"I know because of the 'popularity' of this album I will catch a lot of flak for this, but so be it. Rumours have been known to destroy others many times in the past and this case is no exception! This album,(and the induction of Stevie-(Baaaa)- Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham into Fleetwood Mac), killed this Great Band starting with the pop tripe of 'Rumours'. ""Heroes Are Hard to Find"" was the last ""REAL"" Fleetwood Mac album, which also proved the title point. Nicks and Buckingham were no heroes! A ham sandwich any day of the week.Those who still relish the rock blues sound that WAS Fleetwood Mac until 1974 know what I mean. The Albums- Fleetwood Mac, Mr. Wonderful,Then Play On,(particularly),Kiln House, Future Games,(WOW!),Bare Trees,Penguin,Mystery To Me,(double WOW) and Heroes Are Hard to Find complete the must haves of the band I LOVE! Rumours buried them in ""the tomb of the rundown pop song"". R.I.P."
5,Includes bonus cd,"Fleetwood Mac is a powerhouse of talent, musical gifts, and not least of all, emotional turmoil. ""Rumours"" showcases why Fleetwood Mac is so spectacular and why they have it all -- the powerhouse rhythm section of drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie, the quirkiness of Lindsey Buckingham, the elegant musical stylings and graceful keyboard/piano playing of Christine McVie, the etherealness of Stevie Nicks. The 1976 Rumours collection was their lives laid bare for the world to see.The cd is available in an enhanced version and an expanded extra tracks versions. Both aren better than the original but only the expanded version has a bonus cd with alternate takes and demos. If you are huge Fleetwood Mac fan, the expanded version is worth it. Otherwise the enhanced version should suffice (and its cheaper)."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"The gloves are adverstised on the box as one size fits all. I have an average size hand and could not put a glove on the right of left hand. Reason: muich too small for my hands. Apparently from what I've read in the review area, this problem is shared by others. Amazon needs to make a note to their customers that one size does not fit all"
1,Not created equal,"I ordered these gloves and loved them, so I ordered more when I ran out. The second case of gloves was NOT the same type of material. I checked to be sure I didn't just order a different product, but all the boxes say Item 4850 and the packaging is basically unchanged. The first time I used Item 4850, it was soft, supple and had plenty of stretch. The second time around, Item 4850 is stiff and has very little give. My husband could use the first order I received and now, I can barely put them on my own hands. I will use what I have but will never purchase this item again."
3,The gloves should be rated Small or Medium,"there are problems fitting this glove, it is not a one size fit all. Recommended only for small hands, maybe medium. NOT for large, XL hands.But the gloves are of nice quality , but very thin. Not recommended for harsh work. Could be used for handling babies, food, and light duty work."
4,The best vinyl gloves,"I am very happy with the vinyl gloves. They fit well and are durable. I use them for housekeeping chores and for cleaning small animal cages e.g. guinea pigs and ferrets. One thing should be corrected in your add on line and that is that the individual boxes contain 50 gloves, not 50 pairs of gloves. The price was great and I will order them again when I need them. Thanks. Barry"
4,How many gloves?,"I like these gloves and have ordered my second case. However, I believe the description should read 600 gloves, not 600 pairs of gloves!Edit July 25,2010: Ordered another case of these gloves. They still advertise the gloves wrong. 12 boxes x 50 gloves = 600 gloves, not 600 pairs of gloves! Guess they don't read these reviews. If they show me I'm wrong, I'll repost correctly."
5,Nothing like Montrose's first...,"When I was young in the mid-70's I went record shopping at Sights 'n' Sounds in Gaithersburg Maryland. Browsing in the racks of records, one of the salesmen asked me what I was looking for. I told him I was looking for something like Montrose's first album. He said ""there IS nothing like Montrose's first album."" He was right. I'm glad this was transferred to CD. It's a true classic. Every track totally rocks !"
5,Amazing for Its Time,"I was there when this album first came out and I am here to tell you that it sounded like nothing else did at that moment. It mezmerized me for months. This album did for heavy metal what Miles Davis did many times over for jazz-set a new standard for its genre or in a sense created a new genre. Forget Led Zep and Robert Plant's whiney, annoying oversinging or Deep Purple's boring vomit-rock. Sammy and Ronnie got it right the first time out and neither has ever come close to matching this unique, simple, male-hormone injected piece of heaven."
3,Where's the digital Remaster?,"Awesome rock; not to be missed. Sadly, this sounds like it was recorded in a garage. If they could only reproduce the success Led Zepplin had with their 1991 remastered box set, this could be an all-time classic! Still, it will forever remind me of their 1978 concert here in Chico, one of their first and my best concert experience, ever. Haggar was God."
5,Need I say more...,"Everyone seems to have summed up this album quite adequately here - in my view THE finest US rock album ever made. It's simply astonishing. The vocals, the riffs, the melodies, the attitude - everything is right and I don't think there has been a more complete album since. AC/DC got pretty close with Back In Black but even that doesn't quite get close to this."
5,balls to the wall gravel throated vocal hell.Awesome!,"This is an album to show you what real rock is all about.The coupling of Ronnie Montrose's screaming thick guitars with Sammy Hagar's defining rock tone instantly pulls you in and won't let go until it's over.I can't think of one album that more accuratley defines a particular genre,and that could apply to right now!Although i love Eddie Van Halen,this was really the first time that i heard the brown sound,so called for the ball crunching thickness of the guitars,I think Eddie took heed of this recording(tone wise anyway).This album is a must have for any real music fan,PERIOD!"
5,MONSTROUS MONTROSE,"Like many people on here have stated,why any of the 8 kick ass tracks on here barely get airplay on classic rock radio is just beyond me!Grrr!Ted Templeman was the amazing producer who made the sound of the guitar on this album monstrous.He would do the same thing 5 years later with Van Halen's debut.Sammy's soulful vocals surpass anything he's done ever since.Ronnie Monstrose is an overlooked guitar hero who can churn out some headbangin' riffs and screaming solos.It may only be 8 songs in length,but every song on here is a classic.This is definitely one of those albums you can listen to from start to finish.It's too bad they couldn't continue with more fantastic albums,but I guess the fact that every song on here rocks makes up for it.So if you like classic hard rock/metal from the 70s and are looking for something new or something you haven't heard before,this is the album you're looking for."
5,Rest in Peace Ronnie,I have been wanting to purchase this album for a long time. I thought today would be a fitting day.
2,Sorry to spoil the party,"This thing packs a punch with some great riffs and kick ass guitar sound i will give you that but it still does not change the fact that this is fundamentally a bad album. Montrose good guitar player, Hagar, good vocalist, band, bad. Terrible rhythm section stupid songs, the whole thing gets tedious after 5 minutes. If you think i am wrong contrast this with Led Zeppelin 4 that came out at about the same time. This group sounds like they would be the opener on bill that was topped by Zeppelin and featured 5 other acts in between."
2,Nothing special,"The reason they weren't big was because they were just like every other 70's rock group aka a Poor mans Ted Nugent. Same crappy rock rifts and a terrible lead singer who would ruin Van Halen (Even though they were pretty bad and should have stopped after David Lee Roth left the group). There better then my band ofcourse and at least they gave it their best shot but all in all they nothing special or anything...they were just average Monotonous rock for the basic rocker who didnt want anythin special, just to rock a lil!"
5,I have two copies,"What to say, just have it, I have my original vinyl record anda CD (to preserve my original). Simply this is the way a greatband plays rock, this is solid gold brass."
4,Get ready to Rock!,"This album defines hard rock. This stayed glued to every rock fan's turntable for most of the 70's not just for Bad Motor Scooter or Rock Candy, but for Space Station #5 and the rest. Sammy Hagar was at his best here. Ronnie Montrose got better as a guitar player but he never rocked more. Even though it is from '73, it still beats out most hard rock that's been recorded since."
4,An Album Everyone Should Own,"This album came out in 1973 and was produced by Ted Templeman of Van Halen fame. It features the solid guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose who was once in Edgar Winter and also Van Morrison with bassist Bill Church. All the songs on this debut contain great guitar riffs for Sammy Hagar to sing over. You could tell right away that he was going to have a long career in music. Denny Carmassi's drumming is also solid and fits each song well. My favorite tracks are Rock The Nation, Space Station #5, Good Rockin Tonight, Rock Candy, and Make It Last. But there's not really a bad song on the album. If you are looking for good straight forward riff-rock, you should get this album."
5,i love it!,i love the roundabout car seat.. i purchased it because i love the fact that its pretty much the only car seat i will ever have to purchase since my baby will be able to use it until she hits 40lbs... shes only 3wks old and i've had it since she was born and she has not been fussy or cried once in the carseat... she seems to love it because she falls asleep or stays asleep while in it! i recommend it!
4,Missing Some Hits,"One CD is suppose to be Kissing To Be Clever, but it's missing the hit Time which is on the album in US. The other CD is a Remixes CD, which has Time only as instrumental. Plus no Karma Chameleon or Church Of Poison Mind. These CDs aren't a compilation of their hits, but two individual CDs packaged as a double CD set."
4,Great story~,A sweet story about St. Brigid. Taking you from her childhood to her example through her life.
5,"Thrilling performance, but an audio quality nightmare.","This is one of the great performances of the Tchaikovsky concerto. The playing is absolutely thrilling and breathtaking! This is one of my favorite performances of the concerto along with Cliburn, Horowitz, and Rubinstein. The sound of this CD is a different story. There are many glitches in sound of the concerto where the pitch suddenly changes. Anyone who will be bothered by this should avoid it. It is very distracting, but I refuse to let it get in the way, and I wouldn't give this CD anything but 5 stars for the performance."
4,tasty looking recipes,"It's not a very large book, but it's got a pretty wide range of recipes from several different countries. All the recipes look very tasty, and there are some fabulous pictures to go along with each. Recipes range from the very simple to moderately complex, so this book should offer an entertaining range of challenges to most kitchen savvy people. This would be a good book for people interested in learning about asian cuisine, or those looking for more recipes to try out. All the ingredients should be relatively easy to find, although some will require a trip to a specialty store. If you live anywhere with a chinatown, finding ingredients shouldn't be a problem."
2,It was alright,This book was good with the exception of the hold Jessica\Will thing. I understand the author wanting to put these two together but time she started it she just about booted poor Jeremy completely put of the series.
4,It was ok,Take Me On dealed with Conner private life that hardly anyone at Sweet Valley High knew about how Conner was going though a hard time dealing with his mother drinking and she get put on probation for drunk driving about how much pain Conner felt and anger at his step dad for just taking over and doing whatever he wanted Conner didnt want his step dad there but dealed with it for Megan and Conner was being a loving brother and protecting his sister.
5,Love it,"This worked as it's supposed to, it came in good condition, & I've used it time & time again. I would order again if I need to."
5,Worth it for Bourgie Bourgie,"I was turned onto this record after hearing Larry Levan's Paradise Garage CD, which kicks off with the transcendentally brilliant ""Bourgie Bourgie"".That tune alone is worth the price of admission. This is fantastically rich, lush music."
3,Good time memories.,"Received my ""Send It"" CD and was the happiest person in the world. Played it for at least 2 weeks straight. Listening to Ashford and Simpson brought back good memories, the times when I was just discovering their sound. What a shame Ashford has gone on. The case looks old and it was cracked, but it had no barring on what was on the inside of the case. I would order music from this place again. I received the CD in a timely fashion as well. I look forward to recollecting my Ashford and Simpson music on CD. It is a great CD to add to your collection."
5,Long Live Jelly Roll!,"For the money, this is an excellent introductory collection of recordings by Jelly Roll Morton. The dates of this set span from 1926-1929. All but two tracks (Deep Creek & Red Hot Pepper) are performed with his red hot peppers. For someone new to early jazz and/or Morton, this set is an excellent starting point. All the tracks are easy to listen two and never get dull."
4,Hits the mark,Easy to set up. Gets the job done. I'd recommend this set for anyone with limited space or in need of a smaller set.
5,Great Deal and amazing picture,"This TV sells for over $1100 in Circuit city and Best buy. I received mine a few days ago and set it up in just a few minutes. The picture in HD is crystal clear and the sound is very clean. Absolutely no complaints!!! If you are looking for a smaller flat panel LCD, this is the one to get."
4,TV Review,"I love the TV with the exception of the speakers and too thin remote. If the volume is slightly loud, there is distortion and the remote is too narrow and should have larger buttons."
2,Poor sound,"sound has been a problem since day one of purchase.Static comes and goes. At first I thoutht it was the cable connection and had them try and correct the problem. Would not reccommend this product, although I have 3 other samsung TV's they are great"
2,dead after 13 months and 4 days,"This is my 2nd one of these - the first one lasted 3 weeks - this one lasted 13 months and 4 days and has the same problem - sound but no picture.I'm giving up on samsung - this is my 3rd samsung product to die this year - a 19"" monitor, a 22"" monitor, now this tv...Picture is good while it lasts, but I don't know how they keep ther rep. if this is as good as their products get."
2,Poor quality picture,"Since I own no other LCD HDTV my review is limited to this model Samsung television. However compared to our older Sony CRT, this Samsung is not even close as to the quality of picture resolution . Any angle of viewing other than direct further diminshes the picture quality. If this is an example of and LCD HDTV or Plasma, I don't want any more."
5,Excellent Video quality and great price,"I have had this TV for about 3 months in my bedroom and I have it hooked to a Pioneer DV-490V-S Progressive Scan DVD Player with HDMI. Also have a standard sat. tuner through the cable input. The HDMI connection from the DVD player is excellent and the standard cable picture is also great through it pales in comparison to the 1080i from DVD player. Let the DVD player handle the resolution for the best performance, but this is a great pairing.I have also hooked up my laptop on occasion with a wireless keyboarad and mouse and get excellent browsing from my bed.All in all, I am very satisfied with the purchase."
1,Got a defect,"My tv lost its image with nothing but a black screen a few months after I bought the tv. Brought it back to repair center, came back with reddish images. Horrible experience."
1,"Nice TV, if it worked","The first TV that I ordered worked for 2 weeks before the picture would only appear in black in white. The replacement TV also worked for only a short time before I had to send it back, too."
4,Seeding cover doesn't disintegrate,"I was under the impression that this seeding cover was supposed to disintegrate. It didn't. Finally, when the grass got about 3 inches high, I slowly removed the seeding cover. Regardless, the product did what I really wanted it to do. It prevented the grass seed from blowing away and prevented the birds from eating the seed. My lawn looks beautiful now. It looked pretty funky for a while with the white seeding cover over it, but it was worth it."
1,Useless,I have tried every conceivable way to figure out how to grow grass under this material but it simply doesn't work.
3,Use Hay Instead,So I did a part of my yard with Grass Fast and another part with hay. It looks the same - grass came up in both places. Hay is WAY easier to use. This product has to be removed eventually or if it gets too hot so you will end up trampling over your new grass trying to remove the mat you put down. The other problem is that if you live on a small incline the water you use to water your lawn will bead off this product and run to the bottom of the incline therefore the grass at the top of your property will often be dry unless you really water hard.The product did keep the birds away which was good but that was about all that was good. The grass came up maybe 1-2 days earlier than using hay. Not sure if it was the light or the product.
3,Egocentric to Eclectic,"James Taylor definitely has his pluses as an artist in the music world. As most, he also has his negatives. Perhaps as Carly Simon wrote about him--vanity, more powerful than drugs, mirrors his abilities and sometimes that mirror cracks. The music is light, not arranged too well. Orchestrations are overpowered by JT himself. This disc could be of better audio quality. The song's lyrics save Taylor."
5,Very Pleasing!!!,"If you like James Taylor, you will like this CD! It has many of his biggest hits and together with his Greatest Hits Volume 2 CD, you will have almost all of his very best stuff! The recordings and song arrangement were good, making for a pleasant listening experience. We only wish this CD had included a few more songs. We liked it, very glad we purchased this!"
3,Warners Needs to Expand,"I still own this on vinyl, and it was about the tenth CD I bought to replace an old LP because it was priced reasonably and contains no duds. James Taylor at his best is most enjoyable, but I have never found any of his albums, not even Sweet Baby James, to be first rate when compared to the works of a Jackson Browne. That means that I have no interest in buying any more Taylor albums even though I know a few songs from the Warner years I would like to have. Warners is not going to sell countless copies of any James Taylor CD in the future, for hardcore fans already have them all, and the rest of us have the Greatest Hits. It is time for Warners to release an expanded Greatest Hits (perhaps titling it Retrospective), spurring thousands of people like me to buy another JT product from them. Add another 6 to 9 songs ('Hey Mr. That's Me Up On the Jukebox' is an obvious choice), and Greatest Hits could be a thorough overview of Taylor's most creative period."
3,James Taylor:Greatest,This CD plays great except it did not download to my ipod. In fact it was replaced by a second one which also did not download.
4,Excellent package of songs from JT's early career.,"This album contains so many low key yet fascinating songs. The lyrics are great. The guitar playing is incomparable. A couple of my favorite covers (Carole King's 'You've Got a Friend' and Marvin Gaye's 'How Sweet It Is'), Some fabulous hits (Shower the People, Sweet Baby James, Fire and Rain), and some more obscure hits (Walking Man, Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight) are included. Buyer Beware: If the f-word is not your thing, there is a live version of Steamroller which probably won't make you happy. My advice to you is to invest in some of James' original cd's from his early career and sit back and enjoy! Or you can just skip that track. The first eleven are priceless! Definitely a keeper!"
3,Another Skimpy Warners Hits CD,"Another compilation of a great artist done in the LP age. Skimpy in terms of time and amount of music and, of course, does not cover Taylor's Columbia music. This fine artist deserves a better retrospective, especially when lesser artists get the boxed set treatment. This CD has room for about 40% more songs on it."
4,How sweet it is.,"I imagine this is one of the best selling collections in history. I mean, who doesn't like this guy? He's like ""John Denver"", great songs that always put a smile on your face. These are mostly his best and biggest hits. 12 songs of just simply good and easy music. Included is ""Fire and Rain"", ""Carolina in My Mind"", and the almost rockin' ""Mexico"". Practically all of these are sing-a-longs. I could also suggest the recent ""Best of James Taylor"". That includes every song on this cd, plus 8 more. It might be the better deal. Whichever one you choose, when you play it, you'll know that ""You've Got A Friend""."
5,Well worth the 99 cents,I've have this on cassette and cd. When it went on sale for 99 cents figured it was worth the purchase again.
5,Great CD,I just love James Taylor's Greatest Hits CD. It has all his best songs and its a nice change from all the new music out right now. Its a must for your music collection.
2,Hey hey,"If you have grey hair turn on the James Taylor. I think the guy is a vampire, not in the cool twilight type of way."
1,Extremely Disappointed after the end of the last song on the CD,"I am a guitarist and have been learning some of James Taylor's signature guitar style, which is great stuff. I have never bought any James Taylor albums and wanted to get some of his music. I bought this CD and listened to it from front to back in one sitting. I got to the last of the last song, and I was extremely disappointed to hear the ""M-F'ing"" phrase."
5,WHO DOESN'T LIKE JAMES TAYLOR?,"WHO POSSIBLY COULD DISLIKE JAMES TAYLOR'S GREATEST HITS? WITH SONGS LIKE ""YOU GOT A FRIEND,"" ""CAROLINA ON MY MIND"" AND ""SWEET BABY JAMES,"" THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES. I'VE BEEN THROUGH 2 TAPES AND 2 CDs ALREADY IN SEVERAL YEARS.HIS VOICE IS SO GENTLE, SWEET AND MELODIC, IT TAKES YOU AWAY TO A PEACEFUL PLACE (UP ON THE ROOF)WHERE TROUBLES ARE SO EASILY FORGOTTEN. IN MY HUKBLE OPINION, THERE IS NO MAN ALIVE WITH A BETTER SINGING VOICE AND A BETTER REPETOIRE OF SONGS!"
5,"Timeless, tireless music!!!!","I am only 18, and even though I wasn't even a twinkle in my father's eye when most of these songs gained popularity, I can't get enough of them. This is finally a CD me and my mom can sing to together!!!!I am a true lover of many styles of music-classical, country, inspirational, oldies. But there is only one title for this CD and it is GREAT!!!! It seems to me that I get tired of even my favourite CD's after a while. However, I can listen to ""Carolina in my Mind"" or ""Mexico"" a million times and still enjoy it as much as the first time I heard it.It seems to me that James Taylor is able to capture time and fill songs with themes that transcend generations- love, laughter, struggle, and survival. This is truly a gift.I would agree that I would very much love to see him in concert someday!!!"
4,Great for car trips and life in general,"I had never really heard of James Taylor before I took a long car ride with my friend's family to Canada. We listened to this album the entire 6 hours there and 6 hours home. Not only did I learn all the words, but I didn't get sick of the melodies or the gentle strumming of the guitar. His music has a wholesome sound to it that bring back my memories of summers long ago."
1,Too bad they spoiled a great record,"I loved this record, but the version of steam roller includes [some profanity]. So, I won't play it around my kids or even many of my friends. Call me a prude, but its a shame that this was included in an otherwise great collection of work."
2,Needs a PG 13 rating or a warning label ........,"I have enjoyed James Taylor's songs and music style for many years and was excited to finally purchase some of his music. However, I was extremely disappointed to hear the version of Steamroller at the end of side 1. The rest of the album is great.If the record producers were trying to make a statement they did. I can not play this tape around my daughter because of the vulgar language in the aforementioned song. I wish I had had the foresight to read others reviews of the album before I had purchased it. I will use more caution in the future when purchasing a James Taylor album .....if I ever do."
3,My Name is James Taylor,Just by mere coincidence my name is James TaylorI have never listened to this CDBut I can tell you my name is James Taylor
3,"Good songs, but incomplete","This is one example where a greatest hits CD is in dire need of an update. Any James Taylor fan knows that he cranked out some more good songs after this compilation. If you are willing to spend a lot more money, you can get the far better import(!) compilation 'Classics', which does include most of ""Greatest Hits"" along with ""Handyman"", ""Your Smiling Face"", ""Her Town Too"" plus other hits and good album tracks. They mercifully deleted the lame ""Steamroller"". My advice is to wait until the record company wakes up and updates this collection, much like the very successful upgrade of Simon and Garfunkel's ""Greatest Hits"". If you just have to have this collection, you can easily find it at most used CD stores fairly cheap."
2,Not Remastered,"I bought this CD since it had 2 songs I wanted not on last year's Best Of (the 1976 version of Something in the Way She Moves and the album version of Country Roads). Since this was just released last month I assumed it was remastered (they had already remastered most of these songs for the Best Of). Well, it was not remastered - what a rip-off. Shame on you Warner Bros. Stick with last year's Best Of, and stay away from all those other recently released Greatest by Warner, like Doobie Bros, Carly Simon, etc (I bet they're not remastered either)."
3,Beautiful but obsolete,"This is everything a ""greatest hits"" album should be: a collection of an artist's most popular, seminal work over a certain time span. That all of these songs are still very much in the popular domain is testimony to James Taylor's incredible mastery and influence. However, the recordings on this set have long been eclipsed by the 1994 double ""Live"" set, which boasts better recording values, a wonderful sense of occasion, and the incomparable late Carlos Vega on drums. While it comes in at (more than) twice the price, it contains every song on this CD and a whole lot more. Even a marginal JT devotee should not regret buying that instead."
4,storage of screws,"stores everything in its place, the drawers are a little flimsy. if the unit had a backing on it i'm shall it will be great"
3,"Decent storage solution, however don't get too excited...","Pros:- More drawers than most other similar storage solutions- Relatively small footprint (if you choose not to mount it)- Plenty of space to create labels for each drawer- Not too difficult to remove drawers if needed, while still staying in place if you pull them out their full distanceCons:- Dividers are a pain to remove from the backing- Too few dividers provided- Overpriced considering it's basically just a bunch of cast plastic- Drawers could be less deep and a touch widerConclusion:There's really not many choices in the market that offer this quantity of drawers so if you're looking to organize a lot of small bits (my use is for electronic components), then this is probably your best bet, even though it's nothing to call home about."
5,Great Product,"Hi. My Atko boxes came appropriately packed and no broken parts. They serve my purpose in my busy workshop. Very happy with these sizes because you cannot find these in lowes or home depot and if you work with as many long carriage and hex bolts as i do, these come in very handy! I haven't orgazined all my nuts and bolts yet, but my guess would be the longest carriage bolt you can fit in here is probably 4 or 4.5"" inch. Thanks!"
2,too expensive,"this product is over priced. it will help organize your misc. hardware . there are similar items which will do the same thing,and cost less ."
1,Very delicate item,This plastic is very delicate when i first got this item the body shape was not right. Jumping on the floor is not a good idea if you have this item everything just star shake. I have this plastic for less than 1 year until my cat destroy it. If you have animal in home don't buy it. any way if you are still thinking to buy it make sure the seller protect well the item other wise the delivery guy are going to damage without know it... goood luck!
3,great product but plastic feels cheap,I bought one of these 2 years ago and love it but when I went to order a 2nd I was expecting the same product and same quality. While this one looks correct the plastic feels cheaper and less well made. I guess akron cut costs. Its a put off for me just because I expected the same quality.otherwise the product is great but would be nice if the inserts came with it I just used cardboard to cut the massive costs of buying the dividers.also the units are supposed to be stack able. they are but can be unstable.
3,Pricey,This cabinet is all plastic. It only comes with 4 drawer dividers. The drawers only divide into 2 sections. All of the other cabinets I have will divide into 3 sections. It's not worth $39 dollars.
5,Great way to organize resistors and other electronic components,"Nothing to complain about here. Well balanced product. Decently thick plastic, drawers can be taken out easily, but dont fall out by mistake."
4,not bad,price could have been better ....with something like this 100 space drawer....and deviders....or opion for a set ...at a great price ...the seller is great ...good delivery...
2,"Cheap, Overpriced, Plasticky Garbage","Well, I'm returning this WAY OVERPRICED, PLASTICKY GARBAGE. After reading the reviews I was expecting MUCH more. Nothing new or better here. I'm often amazed at what passes for quality. The term is relative, I know. The drawers are flimsy, thin and cheap feeling. One of the tabs that helps to keep the drawer from falling out was broken and rattling around inside the drawer. Once again, the tab was cheap and not made to last. I like to buy ""Made In America"" whenever possible. But my god, people. We CAN and OUGHT to do better. It is my patriotic duty to let my fellow Amazoners know that this is Just overpriced, cheap plastic garbage. Functional (hence, two stars instead of one - to be fair) if you're not really annoyed by being overcharged and underserved. Am returning NOW."
1,Very dissapointed,"I'm a huge Voltron fan from way back. I loved this comic book when it came out and was dissapointed that it ended before it's time. Now, for the review. Ever wonder why there aren't more comics turned into DVD versions? Yeah, that's cause it kind of sucks. Yeah, it's nice to hear all the sounds and music. But it's just the art from the comic manipulated to give a sense of animation. Lips don't move which is a little disorienting since you almost think people are talking in an inner monologue.If you love the comic, just read the comic. The music and sound fx in your head will be way better than anything on this disc."
2,Poor Description:,"This product is an animated comic book. It is just the images of the comics that were sold on store shelves. It did not say that in the format, and that was frustrating when recieving the DVD as it were. In the format, on the initial description it should have said Animated comic book, or digital comic book. So that others know that it was not a motion picture. Thank you."
1,dreadful,"Avoid this at all cost. For what I paid to get a bunch of images with lousy voice acting turned out to be an unwise purchase. I like Voltron and never really had any of it's movies. I may have recorded some of the tv shows back in the day but this was my first purchase and I'm writing this to warn all of you that it's bad. Real bad. I don't even think it deserves 1 star. No real animation, like the description says, it's called comics animation. It's where the images you would see in a comic book is moving some but there is no motion within the subjects of the film. But what makes this title even worse is the acting. Sounds like 1 person is voicing 3 of the characters (maybe more) and not doing a good job at it. Don't waste your money...or time. This is the first time I ever bought a DVD and trashed it right after watching."
1,sucks,"had i know it was a comic read to you, i would not have bought both new one that came out,, DO NOT BUY,, ITS A RIP OFF,, NOT WORTH A PENNY!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Voltron: Revelations dvd,It's the follow up to Paradise. Again it's comic anamation. Like the golden book videos of the 70's & 80's. Still pictures with naration basicly. Still an interresting prequel story.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a horrible adaptation of a comic book to the small screen. Seriously, by the comic version!"
5,A must own dvd,if you love Voltron then the more you own the better off you are.I just want them to hurry up with the last two lion sets the red one and then the black one. I am not sure what the black one will look like but i bet it will look cool.a must own for everyone
1,Not your normal Independant film.,Horrible. Highschool level film class material. Come to think of it in film class there were some kids who did better than this. I am a professional airbrush makeup artist and have done special effect makeup. I think these guys could've have done way better and that this should have been a free rental.Its not worth $2.99
2,It was a chore to sit through - there are reasons why it never found theatrical distribution.,"When I saw the blurb for this I thought: ""interesting"". But despite sincere efforts on the part of the filmmakers, this is a film that simply doesn't work. The story is boring, the makeup is awful and the acting is even worse. It was totally amateur and I found myself looking at my watch aching for it to be over. The music? Anyone with a cheesy Roland synth could replicate it, maybe even do a better job. Sorry, but this isn't even a ""so bad it's good"" title. I will say this: Dean Stapleton does the most perfect imitation of Jack Nicholson / Randle Patrick McMurphy I've seen to date - it really is convincing. Also the digital cinematography is very crisp, especially the bright, outdoor scenes in the mountains."
1,Just so boring...,I can't see how people actually gave this movie 5 stars because I couldn't wait till it ended.
3,KILL ME AGAIN...AND AGAIN...AND....,"GROUNDHOG DAY MEETS FRANKENSTEIN?Beautiful albeit chilling setting (Aspen's never looked snowier) and a haunting musical score provide a frigid backdrop for this interesting take on Shelley's durable tale of dangerous resurrection. Our doctor (Franklin Vick) is an obvious homage to Victor Frankenstein and Subject Two is appropriately named Adam.Christian Oliver and Dean Hamilton shoulder the bulk of the movie quite well and the twist is unexpected. It is a tad slow but it's not boring and for a reported $23,000 budget, SUBJECT TWO comes off impressively."
5,Excellent!,"This movie was, in my opinion, an excellent movie. It's not your typical ""living dead"" movie...there is quite a twist on it and it worked wonderfully...The setting was absolutely beautiful, which I believe was quite necessary to point out the contrast between what was taking place and where it was taking place; the contrast between ""beautiful"" and ""ugly."" I highly recommend this film."
2,Story lacked some essential credibility,"If a egocentrical mad scientist unexpectantly kills his assistant and then, that assistant is resurrected, shouldn't that assistant want to give a little payback towards his murderer? I mean, like, the first thing I would have done would have been to look at my murderer and extract a quick revenge! You can't murder me and get away with it!I know I'm taking a horror film way too seriously but that's the problem I had with it. It's a ""Hey stupid, don't open that door"" situation.I found this mildly creative spin on the Frankerstein/Zombie genre a bit too contrived.Also, the two main actors seemed ill- conceived for their roles. These guys looked like fashion models portraying eccentric characters holed up in the rugged mountains? They seemed too far off to be playing these characters. Would you accept Zha Zha Gabor playing a homicide detective?To catch this on TV may be an entertaining surprise. To actually shell out money for this....I don't know!"
3,Not your average horror film!,"I rented Subject Two on Amazon Unbox, based primarily on the user reviews, and I was only slightly disappointed. The subtle homosexual overtones of the film were not brazen enough to be distracting from the other side of the story, the latter of which give pause to considering life and our experiences within. All in all, it was a worthwhile film with good production values, strong acting, and an intriguing plot that, I can confidently state, will not leave you asking how you fell for yet another zombie movie, as this film is not really in that category."
1,Subject Ewwww....,I cannot believe I wasted 2.99 to rent this movie. It is the kind that Mystery Science Theater 3000 used to make fun of. But I tried to watch it without their witty comments. I want my money back!!!!
3,Only OK,"After reading some of the favorable reviews for this movie, I thought I would give it a shot. Although the movie is supposed to be a thriller, I feel like it never really took off. There were moments that made you anxious, but not what I was expecting. The scenery in the movie is beautiful and the acting was definitely spot on.However, overall I found myself waiting to get sucked into the plot up to the end, but being disappointed. The action in the movie is slow paced, so if you are looking for an edge of your seat thriller, this is not the movie for you."
2,"""The Story Never Really Went Anywhere""","I usually easy to please when it comes to films, but I was quite glad when this one was over, because the story line bored me.The cinematography was done very well. But, as beautiful as the scenery was, I didn't really feel it fit this particular story line well.I will say that to me, Dean Stapleton (Vick) looked real ""Jack Nicholas"" and that was interesting."
2,I DON'T STRAIGHT THINK,"Nano technology which has created wondrous things like non-stick ketchup bottles can now resurrect life. Adam Schmidt (Christian Oliver) becomes a guinea pig in this experiment as he is repeatedly killed and revived in a remote snowy cabin. It was cute and clever the first few times, but the interest of this new technology and Adam's ""Gary Mitchell"" contacts becomes boring as you wait for some new revelation that never occurs.The film has a slight twist, although by that point I had lost interest. The acting was decent in what was basically a two man play. The movie is more interesting than entertaining.Parental Guide: 1 quick F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
4,When you can't die...,"An update on Dr. Frankenstein's monster with a living twist at the end:the subjects are 'voluntary'. And death is in the end defeatedby technology. The question becomes what price immorality?If you make the body completely self repairing and you canand do, die over and over again, what do you do if you want to die?Subject number two gets experimented on until he can no longer take it.Murder and death and resurrection become a way of life.The acting is pretty good, the sets are minimal ( a remote mountaincabin)and the plot keeps you interested."
4,Great,"Everything arrived as requested and quite quickly. It was a very easy transaction, although I thought the shipping costs were a bit steep."
4,Casting,"I love watching Judi Dench. Almost anything she does is enjoyable. I have seen all the As Time Goes By episodes and thoroughly enjoyed them. I am very late seeing A Fine Romance. The trouble is I can't believe the story, That her character would care so much for a poor, rude, down and out person is unbelievable."
4,"Not As Time Goes By, but nice to watch","A previous reviewer had noted that it was too hard to believe that Judi Dench's character would fall for Michael Williams' character. This might be helped along by the fact that the two were very happily married in real life for many years until he passed away last year.I really enjoy this series, but feel that many people came upon it looking for something more after loving the As Time Goes By series. The dialog and plot lines don't compare, but it does share the sweetness and simplicity. It is a bit slow-moving, even for its genre. Still, it will provide a supplement for those deprived of Judi Dench's wonderful acting now that As Time Goes By has completed its final season."
4,Good book,"This is a good book and it's short. Its concepts are very elementary. Nevertheless, it doesn't hurt to be reminded about some of the key areas of importance from time to time. I do wish the author had emphasized that teaching Biblical truth always trumps trying to be an entertaining teacher. However, he did hint all around it. Unfortunately, our culture seems to emphasize that it is a requirement that teachings and teachers must always entertain first (often to the sacrifice of getting the truth out). Nevertheless, I do recommend the book. It does have some good and practical ideas that can and should be used to teach truth while working to maintain student's interest."
4,Strong effort from Sweden's Dynamic Duo,"I agree that I thought Centre Of The Heart sounded too much like Savage Garden. Then again, I thought that Savage Garden sounded too much like Roxette when I heard I Want You (Go Figure :) ). I was surprised that they released a new album so soon after HAND, given that it was five years between that album and CBB. Per & Marie do not disappoint (check that: Bringing me down to my knees is not one of their best tunes). It Takes You No Time is probably one of the best Roxette Ballads of all-time. Jefferson, Fool and Real Sugar are great rockers. I noticed they didn't use as many string arrangements on this album like they did with HAND & CBB. Maybe they wanted to move in a different direction by using more computerized arrangements."
3,From Darkness to Light,"The music in this recording is very beautiful. It includes several of my favorite songs. I was disappointed, however, by the quality of the recording. I think it is a recording of an actual Advent Service, so the sung parts are a bit indistinct: it is hard to tell what they are actually singing unless you listen carefully."
1,Poorly executed and buggy.,"My 4 year old son has the previous Pajama Sam games and enjoys them a lot. They run directly from CD-ROM, are very smooth and have excellent gameplay. This game needs to be loaded onto the hard drive (takes 500MBytes). The voice is out of sync for the entire game. There are numerous times when the game will pause unexpectedly for several seconds while the game loads from disk. When Sam moves from one screen to the next, he will freeze in mid air, only to appear several seconds later in a different screen. As a result, there is absolutely no continuity in the game. Frankly, I am shocked that this game was published at all given its incredibly unpolished state. It is a very poor effort; especially since Humungous used to be capable of executing games close to perfection. I won't be buying more Pajama Sam products from Atari. I suggest you save your money and prevent your childs disappointment by not buying this game."
1,kids in tears,I bought the new Pyjama Sam game without hesitation because the other Humungous games are GREAT. But this stinker was slow and froze our computer within five minutes. The game is unplayable. My son is crying and I am so angry that I spent $20.00 on this. It was his brithday present!!! And I can't return it since the box is opened. Don't buy this!!!
2,Technically poor,"I, too, wish I had read the Amazon reviews before I purchased this for my son. The game is so-o-o-o slow, when Sam moves from scene to scene. The dialog is out of sync with the pictures. And the biggest drawback is that there is really only one game. The Shoe, Shirt and Socks are always in the same place and need the same things in order for Sam to retrieve them. The other games had variations to challenge our 4 year olds. I wish that I had never bought it."
1,Atari messed up Pajama Sam!,"I am so disappointed! My children and I love all the Humongous Entertainment titles. They are so clever and well-executed and I was so happy to see another Pajama Sam out. What a mess it is, though. The voice is completely off-sync with the character's movements and the screen freezes every time you want to move from one scene to the next. My 5 year old actually got up from the computer the first time she was playing it and said it was no fun. (and she's a hardcore fan of Putt Putt, Freddie Fish and Pajama Sam!) If they don't put out a patch, and soon, I will never buy from Atari again."
1,Disappointing game redux,"I fell in love with Pajama Sam #1, so I thought this would be a slam-dunk with my three kids. Boy, was I wrong! In three plays, all of the items were in the same location each time, with the exception of one minor move, so there is no replay value. It is a huge file that wouldn't fit on my kids' computer, and there is no autorun feature so I had to load it on mine. It moves very slowly and the transitions between scenes are amateurish.I will take a chance on #'s 2 and 3 based on other reviews, but this game needs work. Don't be the first on you block to buy it!*************Now that I've tried games 2 and 3, I have to downgrade this one."
1,Atari ruined Pajama Sam,"My daughter and I have loved the Pajama Sam games. We've waited months for this new one and what a letdown. As soon as Sam opened his mouth my daughter knew it wasn't the same voice. It feels amateurish considering the awful transistions between screens, the jerky animation (on a fast computer!) and the hopelessly out-of-sync dialogue. Having waited for the new Putt Putt as well, I can only surmise that it will be as bad as this one. Stick to the first three Pajama Sam games and hope that this will be the end of the series."
1,Pajama Sam: LIfe Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff,"Every year my children and I await for the new Freddi Fish or Pajama Sam game to be released. Usually, it's a few years wait. I have to say that I am utterly disappointed in the latest release of Pajama Sam. Humongous has such a great following with their line of children's software. How did this product ever get passed the testing group? Perhaps a big company like Atari doesn't have one??? Hard to believe. (...) I hate to see this series end. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought this. It's so bad, Atari should have a recall."
5,Pajama Sam: Life is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff,I just wanted to say that our family has alway enjoyed the Pajama Sam games and the latest one is no exception. I strongly recommend this game because my kids have really enjoyed it.
1,Pajama sam,"I really love all of Pajama Sam's games, but this latest one from Atari really [is bad]...""Life is Rough When you lose your stuff"" explains the latest PC software. Pajama Sam lost his stuff when Atari took over. They made this one too fancy like the Atari Video game for TV, not computers. What ever happen to Infogrames??? Check with someone who has this software before buying. Because you might not like this one. I didn't..."
1,A terrible follow up,"I ordered this for my five year old against the advice of other reviewers. We have all of the other Fredddi Fish, Pajama Sam, Putt Putt and Spy Fox games and my son loves them all. I felt that I should keep his collection up to date, so ordered the new PJ Sam. It's awful. Sam's mouth doesn't match the words, it takes far to long to get from location to location, and it took forever to load into the computer! My nephew, who is eight, attempted to play this with my son because he loves to play my son's games. Both got tired of it very quickly. Instead, we all played a game I had found in a store for $4.00 (Hokus Pokus Pink - a Pink Panther game) It was similar to the Humongous games and a lot of fun. I hope Atari makes some improvements and continues producing these games the way they were made before."
5,Pajama Sam: Life is rough when you lose your stuff,"I had hours of Fun with this game. My Son and I have always been Humongous fans of Pajama Sam.The story Lines and Characters have always been seccond to none, and this game is no different. My son and I love the sponge he is incredibly Funny. My son makes the cutest chompy noises while he eats the mold to help Pajama Sam on his exciting adventure. We have played it several times and unlike some of the other reviews I have seen on this site we have never had a moment where we wern't spellbound and thrilled by all of the wildly funny situations that Sam gets himself in to. While the loading times aren't as good as some of the previous games it is still 500 times better than anything else out there for my son age group. Its good to see in a world with so many violent games that there is one campany that still makes games that are entertaining. I can only hope that this company keeps making Pajama Sam for years to come..."
4,Pajama Sam 4,"This is a very good game! It only works if you have the right computer. I liked the other games and this one I liked as well. I liked the sponge character the best. Anyway, don't listen to the one star reviews! If you have the right computer, this is very fun. On the right computer, it only takes 5 seconds to get from one place to another. I was expecting, from the other bad reviews, that it would be longer. One thing I don't like is his new voice. Also, the game is a pretty challenging one. Also, you can't stop the episode things you saw by pressing the escape button (like you can with other Pajama Sam games). So, if you like the other Pajama Sam games here are the Good and Bad:Good: Fun,challenging, creative, good characters, makes you think, on right computer works great. Bad: new voice, cannot skip scenes, slow by 5 seconds, mouths move strangely, slow on wrong computer."
3,It's slow but...,"my son really likes it. That was my biggest complaint...the gaps between scenes. My son gets impatient too, but he still likes it. All of the other complaints to me were not a big deal It's a pretty long game though and a bit tricky but it's entertaining. Because it's so slow and long, we don't bother clicking on all of the trading cards that are found all over.I found Pajama Sam You Are What You Eat From Head to Feet for $7.99 but then I found a 2-disc set of that same game with this one for the same price. I'm really glad we bought that 2 disc set. It's a deal, since it's like we got this game for free."
1,Very disappointed in this game. Not as good,"As other reviews mentioned, the game is choppy, the sound quality is terrible and it takes forever for the character to move from place to place. In addition, neither my child or I could find half the objects! For instance, we found the jar to put the fireflies in but it said that there needed to be holes in the top first. But, there is nothing that is sharp that you can find to make the holes! And, you can't get into the cave without the jar of fireflies. Very few places to visit in this game and hardly anything to do in most of the places. No hints about where to look for things or what parts are even needed! Disappointed as the other Pajama Sam games were so easy. This is a child's game? I as an adult couldn't find half the items, how is a child supposed to?Nancy Farkas"
2,you get what you pay for!,"Looking at the product online, it appeared to be adequate for the purpose. But after recieving the Pilot PL330c lights my friends opinions were correct. The mounting bracket is very thin and flimsy, The bracket to light housing bolt is a little to long and tightens up against the light housing. It doesn`t take much to knock the lights out of adjustment. Inside the lights the shiny metal piece over the bulbs are not centered and are bent, you can see this easily and they look very cheap!!! Well I just wanted something to fill the holes in the aftermarket bumper cheaply and that`s just what I got!. If you can, by a better product and pass on this one, wish I did..."
3,Useful illumination,"I purchased these along with some Optilux 1450 fog lights, and had a shop install both sets on the lower grille of a 2006 Prius. The installer removed the left- and right-side sections of the grille, placing these lights outboard and the Optilux inboard in each section. He used two standard, illuminated rocker switches that plugged into spare sockets in the dash, rather than using the cheesy switches that came with both install kits.He angled these lights slightly outward, so that I could see cyclists and pedestrians suddenly entering intersections after dark (we seem to have a problem with that here).If it's foggy/rainy and dark, I will turn on both sets of lights. But these lights seem to be more effective than the Optilux, and I normally turn them on with the headlights by default. I don't know how easy the kit is to install, since someone did that work for me. But I would recommend them based on performance."
5,more lights on the road = saver,now it is more saver to drive on road by darkness or rain. Easy to install and perfekt quality. And my Jeep like it very much.
4,yeay! a straight-forward intro to LabVIEW,"I'm using this book in conjunction with an experimental methods class this semester. I did have some exposure to LabVIEW before, but this book has taught me more in two chapters than I learned all last semester. (It's also been a very basic review of waves). The material is presented in an intelligent order and I've had no trouble finding things. The layout lends well to self teaching as well."
2,Very good information in terrible print,"i have 2 serious concerns with this book:-1-while the information content is really good, the book print is very low quality for a book with this price Tag.2-the VIs that are posted on the web associated with book are obsolete, it didn't open on my labview 2009 which wasn't able to convert it saying it is too old.the authors should have updated those VIs since they do not include the CD any more with the book, and post the material on the web....so what is their problem updating those VI???"
4,I'M HOOKED!!! :-),"From the first to the last song, I enjoyed every one!! Great sound, lots of energy, emotion and talent on this CD!! If you are looking for a good rock CD, try this one out especially at this good bargain price. So much great talent out there that's even better than what I've been hearing on my radio stations lately."
1,Worthless GARBAGE!!! Pure JUNK!!!!!,I just purchased this pen and pencil set but will be sending it back immediately. Cross used to be a quality name but alas no longer. The pencil stopped working after about five minutes. Overall the quality is very poor. This will be my last purchase of any Cross product.
2,Not very durable,"I used this net to clean scum from a 20x20 foot drainage pond. The first thing I noticed was that if you extend the handle it bends and would easily break. So I shortened the handle all the way, and was very careful not to put too much pressure on it. After about 30 minutes of skimming algae from the pond, I noticed a 2x2 inch hole in the net. Apparently a stick or some sharp object had punctured it. Now I have to buy something else more durable."
1,one time,Broke first time the net was used to catch fish in a small pond. Good idea as a collapsible net but therein lies it weak points. It is now permanently collapsed
5,kind to fish,The net is well constructed and easy to use fully extended. It did not harm any of my fish when I had to relocate them for pond repair.
4,Good for Unix and Linux beginner..,Easy to understand for Unix beginner..As a Linux user by myself i needed to learn Unix and this book gave me glimpse what Unix is about.. i recommend this book to Unix and Linux beginner!!!
5,Stan Laurel &Oliver Hardy EarlySilent classics Vol 3,You sure cant go wrong when it comes to laughing. If you are a fan of Laurel and Hardy this is a movie who must see.
2,Mulan II summary,Waste of money. I should have just rented it. Extremely cheesy and predictable. Nothing like the first movie. I didn't like the songs and to me the graphics and performance was dumb. Save your money. It's a one time watch type of movie.
1,Goof,"It is more than likely my fault, not understanding the regions format, and I somehow missed the disclaimer, in red, at the bottom, so I spent $17.00 for nothing. However it bothers me that the seller seeing that the item is going to a region 1 address (I think), would knowingly send an item that is clearly not meant for that region. Yes, I know let the buyer beware, but how about a little responsibility on the sellers part also. tja"
3,celtic spiral pendent,I gave this pendent 3 stars because it is ss it looks more like pewter than ss.The pendent is still very pretty.
2,Made by Crayola...NOT Crayola quality.,"Pros* Nice wooden case* Lots of different coloring utensils to choose from* Apparently $29.99 from Toys'Us.Cons* Wooden case contains plastic trays which apparently should have been glued in (I only know this because the inside of the ""wooden"" case contained dried glue). Because of this it is awkward to close without the trays falling out.* Several markers have died already, the entire set of markers feels like it was made by a different company* I paid $59 here, should have gotten a better set at that price.Summary: If you can get it for $29.99, you know what you are getting. If you have to pay more than that opt for a different set."
2,25 bucks at toys r us,WAY too much for an art case. You can get it in stores at Toys R US for around 25 bucks. Complete price gouging ripoff!
5,Why so much on Amazon?,Great gift but only $32.99 at Toys R Us this year. Why such a MAJOR price difference on this site? Ridiculous!
3,Toy fine--however packaging leaves alot to be desired,The Crayola 200 piece Masterworks Art Case was (in it self) a good product. However when it arrived--whether it was damaged prior to packaging or after----the wooden handle was broken and there was a big piece off the side of the wooden case. Could have sent it back but how do you have a grandaughter give it up on Christmas Day???????????????????? At least Crickets answered me back about this but AMAZON did not. So here is the review from an unha.ppy customer
4,Awesome Item for Christmas!,"We got this as a Santa gift for our 6 year old daughter. She hasn't opened it yet, obviously, since it's not Christmas but it arrived on time and it wasn't broken. We did, however, buy it from Toys R Us. Just wanted to review on here, as well. I have shopped at amazon.com for YEARS and have always been pleased with their service and their competitive pricing. That being said, I can not believe that this is going for $75 now! I bought it at Toys R Us for $24.99 a few weeks ago! They are now out of stock, and maybe Crayola is discontinuing this product, which would explain the sky-high price on amazon. It's a great set, but definitely not worth paying $75 for it! Save your money and get the Crayola Super Art Coloring Kit - your child will still be thrilled and you will still be able to sleep at night! :)"
5,GREAT set. A must have!!,All you 60s anime fans and those who grew up watchimg Astro boy this set is a MUST have. Do not pass it up. Make sure to get both box sets. It is such a blast watching them with my three year old son and watching him discover Astro boy for the first time. He was a raving fan after the first episode.
5,The finest modern commentary on the fourth Gospel,"Considered by many evangelicals to be a leading scholar in the field of biblical exegesis, Professor D. A. Carson has produced an outstanding commentary on the Gospel According to John. One of the many strengths of this commentary is Carson's ability to combine his extensive knowledge of biblical theology with a thorough exegesis of the original text. No study of John's Gospel is complete without this fine commentary. Highly recommended!"
2,Baptist bashing approach to St. John,"If you would like an exercise in Baptist theology purchase this commentary. If however, you would like to know something about the Gospel of John, I recommend you try another commentary. Carson is almost maniacal about defending Baptist belief and therefore rejects the sacramental teaching of the fourth Gospel. He writes in a chatty style, using the lingo of a pseudo intellectual guru. This is possibly the worst commentary on St. John that Eerdmans have ever published."
3,Don't buy this for Lanza!,"Oh dear. Whoever compiled this collection was not paying much attention to the Mario Lanza selections! Several of them feature Lanza at his worst (Funiculi' Funicula', Santa Lucia Luntana, With A Song In My Heart), and Be My Love excepted, the tenor recorded superior versions of all of them on other occasions.Jan Peerce and Jussi Bjoerling fare much better, with both tenors sounding at the peak of their form. Ironically, several of their selections are more closely associated with Lanza (Vesti La Giubba, Granada and Che Gelida Manina), and one can only wonder at the reasoning behind these choices.Buy this if you're a fan of Peerce or Bjoerling; admirers of Lanza should look elsewhere for his best recordings."
1,Medieval Civilization,"I attempted to read the English version. I found the style of the writing made it very difficult to follow. I am a patent attorney, so I am accustomed to reading cryptic and hard-to-follow writings. I stopped reading this one after 36 pages."
1,unsatisfird,Because I did not order this product and one stop shopping stinks it came to me any way. I sent 3 emails with in 25 min to cancel and got no response and returned the book at my expense. still being charge for the full amount and shipping on my account. BE careful
1,Complicated and incomplete,This book is way too complicated to figure out. Half the workouts have way too much volume and are to hard for the average person to perform. After I read it I walked away not feeling like I new anything about nutrition or how to mentally attack the workout. Its incomplete. In all fairness there are certain workouts that could help some people but not all people. Its a pass......
4,Weight Training Workouts That Work,"I purchased this book from Amazon after reading about the importance of increasing muscle mass to boost your metabolism in ""You On A Diet""by Dr.Rozien and Dr.Mehmet Oz.Although I have had a set of dumbbells and an illustrated pamphlet of various exercises for some time,I have never taken it very seriously.I am currently reading both books and intend to start my weight lifting program in about a week."
4,Good book,This book is a good guide for starting a work out program. It lacks some of the touches a personal trainer can provide but it is a helpful reference.
1,Comfortable but none lasting,"I bought these steel toe socks for my husband because socks didn't last anytime without getting holes in the toes after a few time wearing socks and his toes hurt when wearing steel toe shoes. After searching I came across these sock and read the reviews from those who had bought them. They sounded great so I bought 2 pairs for my husband to try and if he liked them I would buy more. After wearing the sock two times each both developed a hole in the toe. He did say that they felt great on his feet, however they didn't last. Jane G."
1,Disappointed,"Thought this was the answer to making my husband comfortable in his steel toe work shoes. I also was hoping that it would end the daily sock throw away.... due to the holes at the toes of his socks. My husband found them very cushiony and comfortable, but after two days, there was the dreaded hole at the toes. Much too expensive to be thrown out after to wearings."
2,"Good idea, poor story","I found the ideas behind this story very interesting and relevant. However, the writing and the storytelling were terrible. I finished it but ended up scanning the last third of the book just to get it over with."
2,If you like Made For TV movies...,"After reading the synopsis, I was disappointed to learn that this book failed to live up to its potential. The author chose a great deal of topics to write about, but because he never went into any of them in great detail, you kind of got the feeling you were reading a Made For TV movie. The only detail he seemed to delve into was the sex scenes between the two main characters which served no useful purpose to the novel other than to allow the author to write about some adult fantasy of his."
3,Some potential at the beginning - then I lost interest,Initially this seemed like a great book about the demise of the ecosystem on Earth. I found myself to see less and less about the outcome of the book as I continued reading it though! The other included a good selection in his bibliography for future reference and included some good web pages! I would wait for paperback on this one!
5,"if you're only gonna buy one D.B. album, here it is!","Growing up in Northern California, I heard my share of Doobie's tunes. I think everyone who lived there had at least of their albums. This one is great, it's got all of the best cuts off of the first few albums. I mean, who can't help but tap their toes or sing along to classics like ""Black Water"", ""China Grove"", ""Listen to the Music""... These guys defined an era of rock and roll, and these are their definitive songs!"
4,Nice CD of Hits,"This group had great rock hits that came from the '70s. I already knew hits like ""Black Water"" and ""China Grove"" when I got this CD. Now I have those hits plus other ones I never heard, like ""Take Me In Your Arms"" and ""Without You."" Along with Steve Millers Greatest Hits '74-'78, this is a nice greatest-hits CD."
5,Very Good Compilation album!,"The Best of The Doobies does agreat job of portraying the Doobies entire career into one eleven song CD. It contains all the essentials. It won't let you down. If you want the best songs of the Doobie Brothers career, get the Best of The Doobies."
4,Gap filler,"The Doobie Brothers / Best of the Doobies (single disc - Warner Bros): The Doobies were a very entertaining group and this 11 tracks hits disc is most useful for those who already have their favorite Doobies albums but want to fill in the gaps will the missing hits. For those who just want a hits package, there are longer ones availible. Four Stars."
5,A True Greatest Hits,"There are very few bands that can come up with as many hits as the Doobies, it seems that on other ""greatest hits"" albums there's maybe 2-3 songs I like, not with this album where every song is good. 5 stars!"
5,Blast from the Past,"On a whim I perused the sale site for albums and saw this ""Best Of"". Talk about a walk down memory lane. Instead of listening on the record player, or 8 Track player, I loaded it on my iPod and listened to the whole album (can we call them albums anymore?) Everyone was a winner and I enjoyed listening to the 11 songs....if you were a fan, you will enjoy getting the best tracks!"
5,Doobies collection of all their best!,"An excellent music CD compilation that contains Doobie Brothers greatest hits song classics from the seventies like ""China Grove"", ""Listen To The Music"", ""Black Water"", ""Long Train Runnin"" and ""Jesus Is Just Alright"". This was Michael McDonald's solid major highpoint debut when he became lead vocalist of the band!"
4,It Keeps You Runnin,"A solid collection of hits from one of the most popular bands of the 70s. A bit premature and a bit awkward, especially with the McDonald and Johnston music mixed together. Also, nothing from Minute By Minute, their best album. Maybe a rerelease containing more songs, bios, etc would be in order for this great band. CDs can hold a lot more music than what is currently on this album."
4,I enjoy listening to the CD,"I am old enough to remember listening to these songs on theradio regularily, so thoroghly enjoy hearing them now."
5,Wow..,"Dude..Love is comin..The righteous..""Takin' it to the Streerts""..F'N..Awesome.Real music that keeps us real: Reminds of the solidarity we need to stay lovin the folks we call humans who are hard to Love: ""Long Train Runnin"" reminds us without love where would you be now:In fact that's the lYric! F..Good..Makes me think Sarolta's not hatin me.."
4,It's classic rock.,"This album may be half as long as their ""Greatest Hits"" album, but it contains the best of their early hits, and what many consider to be their best era. Only a couple here are with ""Michael McDonald"", the rest are old school ""Doobie"" rockers. Nine of these eleven were big songs, including ""China Grove"", ""Black Water"", ""Listen To The Music"", and ""Jesus Is Just Alright"", which I think was a ""Byrds"" song. There's also a ""Best Of Volume 2"", but I would just go for the 20 track ""Greatest Hits"" to tell the truth. Any of these collections will have you ""Rockin' Down The Highway"" though."
5,Timeless '70s Rock - Still Going Strong!,"Having only recently (within the last 2 years) been introduced to the Doobies, and having seen them live last year, this album of rip-roaring classics sums them up - outstanding! This is mainly pre-Michael Mcdonald era stuff - thank heavens! - and no matter where you play it, I challenge you not to enjoy it! Great party music, great driving music....great anywhere music!! This hard-working and great sounding band have been underrated for years. A great intro to their music if you're new to them."
3,Good!,"This CD is very good! Not many songs or tunes I recognize though, but it is still a good listen!"
4,"Good tool, good price",I received the tool in a timely fashion.Assembly was easy.Both the disk and the spindle work like a charm.The only complaint I have is that the dust collection on the spindle is not the best.Also I wish there was a storage space in the cabinet.
5,Even non-Trekkers will like this one.,"Data secretly builds a daughter named Lal, and then begins the job of raising his daughter, until he is asked to turn Lal over to Starfleet for study and training. The questions of parent/child rights, governmental intervention into family concerns, and the wonder of seeing the world through a child's eyes makes this a thought-provoking emotional episode that many of my non-Trekker friends have enjoyed viewing."
2,Knee jerk reaction,"Except in the next-to-last chapter where he obtains a surprising bout of objectivity, the vast majority of this book is a knee-jerk reaction to the supposed contention that all evangelicals consider all Catholics unsaved. Such strident pronouncements plague this book to the degree that it is far less than a Catholic look at evangelicalism than a paranoid recapitulation of all the so-called manifold ways on which evangelicals supposedly and smugly look down on down on Catholics in particular (i.e., the Pope is Antichrist, Catholics sell indulgences, etc.). What is most alarming is that the back cover boasts that this book is the recipient of five Catholic press awards. It's scary to think that such publications seem to believe that Feuerherd somehow got it right."
3,ok,"This pack is ok. I didn't have much luck with getting good cards though. But in this pack you can get the pieces of final!(Hint)- When you get yu-gi-oh cards, the liter ones have the holo's in them!. The heavier ones just have a plain old rare card that is comman.So if you are going to buy hevier packs, just remember what I said! If you buy hevier packs, it is just a waste of money."
2,Only get this for a laugh and if you have money to waste.,"I give this video 2 stars, since it did provide useful information on the Chihuahua, albeit in a hasty manner. Be warned that the contents of this video are so poorly put together that it seems like a spoof on pet videos rather than a serious product. For laughs, take a look at it for yourself and check out the host and dog superimposed on the background; the shorthair chi presented as a longhair; the questionable ""vet"" with the top half of his face cut off the screen and on mute while the host explained instead; and finally, the example family man-handling their chi ( they should have said chis are not recommended for young children, but you'll find that out after watching the video ). The ""bonus"" expert seemed embarrassed to be on the video, yet was the best part of the show; however, it would have been better if she was demonstrating training techniques with a chi rather than an australian sheep dog!"
1,Chihuahua Misery,This video has no redeeming value. Some guy talks as you look at his chihuahua.It teaches nothing and is pure boredom.
5,"Nice Scope, poor service","The scope is nice. Works great, good features. Unfortunately the seller I ordered it from sent me the wrong model. I wanted the rubberized version with scope rings and got an entirely different model. I got stuck with a (good) scope I didn't want."
1,Not Appropriate for Kids!,"Backyaard Football 2004 is way too inappropriate for da yunggunz. Other kids tackling other kids is not right for kids. My son bought this game and the next day he went to the principles' office for tackling a preschooler and the kid went to the hospital and fractured is head bone. So as you can see, don't buy this game for your kids. XOXOXOXOXO"
3,Selections are too narrow and confining,"Sixty percent of this volume is occupied by the first , and half the second ,cantos of "" Don Juan "". Over two hundred pages of precisely metered 8 line stanzas make for a rather ponderous pocket companion. It gives the book a heavy and incomplete feel. More lyric verse would have greatly improved it's portability and given it greater breadth.Recommended for Byron fans or anyone collecting the Pocket Poets series."
3,The second best of album,"Back in the old days(the 1970's)when we used to go to shows this was one of those tapes that everybody had. We all owned the original albums at home, but whenever a road trip was involved both this and Skeletons were always in the car/van/ect.(along with our concert tapes). This collection seems short by todays cd standards, but this was back in the old days. The thing that was nice about this collection was that it drew heavily on the official live lps as well as including the single versions of Dark Star/Born Cross Eyed. By the way the pictures of the band on the inside of the lp version are nice. It's still a good listen but my only two wish at the time was that they would've used Playing from Bob's Ace and I also wished that they could've used something from Garcia."
5,"Its the dead, impossible to give anything less than 5 stars","This is a nice 2 disc package. It has a lot of the deads older classic concert staples. Not as good imo as the newer best of and I prefer the live dead when they jam and disc 2 isnt really that type of cd, but if your just in the mood to hear really great songs by themselves without the jamming you cant go wrong here. If I were just getting into the dead i would start with the newer best of , i think this is more for fans to have all the classic dead tunes in one place, Long live the dead!"
5,Living Stereo,"Excellent historical recordings from the AGE of Living Stereo-the way recordings should have been done-the quality behind these reecordings, and the teamwork that was involved with these as well.. John Phieffer well deserved the credit due in his efforts in turning around RCA-VICTOR to an audiophile quality production."
2,Monotonous!,I bought this CD for a couple of favorites. I always cut to those couple tunes as the rest of the CD is just monotonous. The Rudies are definitely better live than recorded. See them if you get the chance.
5,The first Alice Cooper album to get,"This is my very first Alice Cooper album and is tied as my favorite along with Billion Dollar Babies. Greatest Hits contains 12 excellent songs from Love it to Death, Killer, School's Out, Billion Dollar Babies, and Muscle of Love. This album will probably determine if you want to start a collection of other Cooper albums. Some of my favorite tracks include ""Desperado"", ""I'm Eighteen"", ""Hello Hooray"", ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", and ""Elected"". I would've liked to hear some more tracks from Love it to Death and School's Out, but this compilation is already perfect."
2,NOT ORIGINAL RECORDING MIX! SINKS THIS OK HITS SET!,"It's hard to trash this CD, but the original mix of these songs is so much better I can not recommend it! Just listen to ""I'm Eighteen"" on the album CD and then listen to this version on the hits and it says it all! The Harmonica is buried on the hits disc and it destroys the dynamics of the entire track! The whole album sounds like it is one flat level with no dynamic range what so ever! It is also missing too many great songs. Do yourself a favor and save your bucks and buy a few of his albums instead.....it will be well worth it!"
5,Title says it all.,The greatest hits of one of the 1970s most outrageous rock bands. The album is a snapshot of the first half of a decade of tremendous music and tremendous changes in what got played on the radio. Excellent album.
4,Cool stuff here,"Okay, I'm not ACG's biggest fan. But there are great songs aplenty here. I always loved I'm 18, for one. School's Out, that song rocks too. Be My Lover, Under My Wheels, Desparado, Elected, No More Mr. Nice Guy, and Billion Dollar Babies are all amazingly good songs too. But my favorite's gotta be I'm 18. A couple missteps: I could've done without Is It My Body, though it's not bad. Hello Hooray's a bit overblown, but still an OK song; Teenage Lament '74 and Muscle of Love could've been pulled. But Cooper's best stuff rocks, and this is far better than the hair-metal it sadly inspired. Get a copy of this CD."
5,Strong Argument,"What I really enjoyed about this book was its organization and the strength of its arguments. It begins by laying out the extent and reasons for poverty in America. Then it shifts to developing several lines of reasoning as to why poverty is such an important issue that affects us all. And finally, the last third of the book talks about what can be done to effectively address poverty. I particularly enjoyed the last chapter that talks about what an individual can do in their daily life to create a positive change with respect to reducing poverty. I definitely plan to use the arguments in this book in the future.I also appreciated the blending of solid research evidence with the sense of social justice and values that the author brings to bear. Overall, very well done, and very important!"
5,Definitely the Book to Read!,"What I found so valuable about this book, was that it provided a really innovative framework for understanding American poverty. ""One Nation, Underprivileged"" lays out in a very compelling way the argument that poverty affects us all, rather than just a small subset of Americans. This is definitely the book to read in terms of beginning to create a positive change to deal with this enormous problem"
1,Different version??,"I ordered this book a month ago However, I guess I received the older version of same book.. no It Is the same book I think, I am not sure because I haven't comapre the book with other book that has the Picture on the cover that I expected.Seller thought that If the meterials are same then there is no problem sending different covered book?It was upsetting me the fact that I received the book with the different cover on which looks like published in 10 years agoI am keeping the book anyway because I need the book for my schoolbut I am pretty sure when I try to sell the book to the bookstore or someone eles they won't willing to pay me the same price as ""used book"" because the book that I received looks really really old."
5,Very well put together...,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had the feel of being in that era. If you're a history buff, you'll like the way this movie was constructed. Real Russian equipment, Russian spoken throughout. I don't have anything bad to say about this movie."
2,Repetetive,"It contains very interesting things that can be taken into consideration for making a class. The problem with it is that since many teachers and parents write in it, it quits getting your interest half way down the book."
5,A real sad book!!!!!!!!,"This book is REALLY REALLY sad!!! It almost brought tears to my eyes. If you don't like books that have people dying or you hatesad books, don't read this one. BUT, I suggest you read it because it is a really really good book!!!! It is about a girl who named Julie who is lives in Vienna. When Hitler comes to her town she sees how badly he treats Jewish people. She being Jewish herself is treated badly. Her father decides that something should change....and you will have to read the rest in order to find out!! I read this book in two days (nights really). It was one of the sadest books I have ever read. It really makes someone understand how badly the Jewish people were treated when Hitler was around!"
5,"Excellent book, One eye laughing, the other weeping","Julie Weiss is a 14-year-old girl who is a Jewish rich girl, life may seem good and perfect for her until...Adolf Hitler, an ""anti-Jewish"" leader comes and brings terror to Vienna. Julie's best friend Sophy, is sent to England being adopted, Julie's mother commits suicide, her brother Max runs away, and her father sends her to America to be adopted by her aunt who was never heard from, all Jewish things were messed up. Julie will just be satified with her life but she worries about her father in Vienna. There is a fictional epligue and historical note and pictures of the era. I recommend this to 9-12-year-olds."
4,"One Eye Laughing, the other weeping","Watch out! I've read several of the Dear America books. This one has SEVERAL incidents that are not appropriate for 3-5 grade children, the age that read these books in my school.It would, however; be fine for an older audience."
3,1st impression,Nice and handy altough a little expensive (+ 20 EURO shipping incl.). A digital version (also for Pocket PC) would be a nice alternative in these modern days.
4,My old.ship mentioned,I was on uSS ST MiHIEL When we brought Zero back to Seattle after Dutch Harbor was bombed. It brought back many memories of WWII. I learned much more about what happened from this book about this plane than all I learned about it since the war.
4,Solid instruction...,"..it is. After ""Blues You Can Use"", it keeps me going by introduction of theory, new chords and solo exercises. Arpeggios pattern are introduced here, very useful and important concept, though it is not clearly explain how to practice it One has to simply memorize it. Maybe there are some better books in this venue that I will take advantage of later, but for now I stick to Genapes."
3,More Blues you can Use,"The book is excellent. It picks up where the prequel left off. The used copy copy of the book was in good shape as advertised, however the CD that was to accompany the book was not included. This was a major disappointment."
1,It does nothing for users of version 2.0,"This manual may be all inclusive for users of previous versions, but it DOES NOT match any features found in Version 2.0. It does not lend itself to a step by step manual on how to do things."
5,Checkered Flag Bar Stool,I bought the checkered flag bar stool for my son's garage. He absolutely loves it! This stool is very sturdy and very comfortable.
4,Sparks fly over temperence in Old West America...,"the heroine of this novel is Hannah Sullivan-a rabid temperence woker and Bible thumper. She's trying to run all the Saloons out of Fortune for all the wrong reasons. Likewise the hero, Ramsey Kellogg, an ex-pinkerton detective, is a hard living, hard drinking man who's hired to protect the saloons-and his die hard reasons for doing so are as misguided as hers. This is a good story of two people in search of family and running from the worst sorts of family in their pasts. If you enjoy reading Western romance you'll probably enjoy this story. The two characters are a lil too slow to realize the error of their ways, IMO, but they do have a happy ending. The love scenes are B-, I'd give the overall story a B+."
5,Not just for Maestros,"The Student Conductor is thoroughly engaging - emotionally and intellectually complex, but the prose is elegantly simple. I loved it as a window into a political culture and the world of classical music, both of which were unfamiliar terrain to me. And a wonderful love story, too. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to be totally immersed in a vivid landscape from page one onwards."
4,An Interesting Glimpse into the World of Musicians and Pain of Germany,"There is a bootcamp sort of relationship between our protagonist and his tough German professor who has been through the worst of Hitler's attrocities. Both wounded geniuses need a little bit of love and a chance to realize their true talents and role as real players in the world of concertmasters. A female oboeist from Eastern Germany plays a role in both of their lives while she deals with her own deamons escaping from the East. There is real passion in the romance that occurs, but the over-riding theme seems to be the affects of the pain and suffering that some of the Germans have lived through during the reign of communism and Hitler.Sometimes, the story seemed a bit harsh and strained, although in the end, I think it was very realistic and the outcome certainly not a stretch. And for a non-musician, there is huge and interesting insight into the world of musicians and the huge effort and talent it takes to get to the top."
1,Does not WORK!!!!,We are now on our 2nd disc and both did not work in my computer which is just a few years old. Never had a problem with any other software. Stay away from this game!!!
2,A little disappointed,"My son is 3 1/2 and loves Dora, but this game was way too easy for him. Don't believe the 3-5 yr age range. The games are pretty repetitive and not very challenging. There's really not that much more to it than what you can get for free from the nickjr.com website.This would probably be better suited for a younger child with a shorter attention span. My son does play it, but we usually whip through all the games pretty quickly and he loses interest."
4,"""Will do more to convince you of what you already believe than change your mind...""","The author definitely tends toward the futurist view, but he neither he nor I should have to apologize for that. It is the most scriptural view.The views are presented with thorough research behind them, and presented fairly. Those enjoying this book most will be those who espouse the futurist position, and would like some ammunition against other views.For a very simple and much less involved commentary on Revelation, may I suggest one written especially for TEENS and NEW BELIEVERS: ""Dragons, Grasshoppers & Frogs!"" (ISBN: 059536668). This is the most practical book I've ever seen on Revelation--a book that few relate to everyday life.All in all, this book will do more to convince you of what you already believe on the Second Coming rather than change your mind on any of it."
5,Comparing it with other books on the subject.,"Your book was interesting, and it did make me think about the things you have written. However, I suguest you take some time and read another book on this subject. It was written by a Pastor. That book is called A Study Through The Great Book of REVELATION. It was published by Publish America. The ISBN is 1-4137-2154-0. My Sunday school class has been using that book and my Pastor has indicated that it seems to show us where we are in God's time schedule. I believe that those two books combined would have made a greater series than the one being shown by NBC."
2,Four views only confuses the issue.,"'Four' different views on 'one' subject might be helpful to beginners, on the otherhand it might also be confusing for them.There can only be 'one' right answer concerning the interpretation of the Book of Revelation. 'Four' different views merely shows there is a lot of 'confusion' regarding this book of the Bible.The Bible says ""where there is evil and self-seeking, there is 'confusion' and every evil thing""."
2,Really Three Views,"As other reviews have noted, the main disappointment here is that this book summarily dismisses historicism, which is a mainstay on any scholarly list of the four systems of interpretation.Although it is true that historicism is no longer a popular view, it deserves full treatment for three reasons. First, historicism was the predominant protestant view for three or more centuries and should be include for completeness. Second, historicist are producing many books in response to the futurism of ""Left Behind"", making readers curious to know how these views fit in. Finally, it is not inconceivable that the ultimate truth will include some elements from each of the four camps, so one should be well-versed in all four views.I certainly hope that the next version includes historicism, as well as the counter-point format."
2,"dry, futurist top-heavy","This book, edited by a professor at a school where, to the best of my knowledge you must believe the futurist view to attend, is densely loaded with information. The historian view, historically held by many, was not included because ""it hasn't been able to predict the Second Coming""--as if any person can! Although I do not support the Preterist view, this book had a convincing argument for that view. The essay on the classic dispensationalist view put me to sleep."
3,Kind of a snoor....,Gentry's presentation convinced me here of partial preterism... this is in part due to Robert Thomas' contribuation that is really not fun. Thomas is overly assertive without warrant and dogmatic without the evidence! Herein lies a convincing essay for Preterism...unfortuantly the rest are not worth reading. The book seems to turn into a showdown between Gentry and Thomas; Pate and Hamstra really do not hold much weight here. Marvin Pate's view is actually quite amusing. Thomas can not handle Gentry theologically although I will concede Thomas the victor of a great number of points. Kenneth Gentry puts Revelation in its original context and it all flows from this standpoint. Winner Kenneth Gentry...
2,It is fine for the under 9 crowd,This is junk candy. My kids love them but overall it is just another sugar product. they will be out of style soon enough and lost in the history of junk candy. The box I received was stored improperly and the candy was all stuck together. Most got tossed out.
3,the other ones are better,"this toy is ok, but my dog likes the frog, dog, & monkey much better.the parrot isnt really loud enough and it does have enough vocal range to really interest the dog."
2,"Our Toy Talks, Does Not Chirp","The toy parrot we received did not chirp as described, but instead says, ""Polly want a cracker?"". Unfortunately, we bought this for a dog that loves to chase the birds in the yard and we thought having a toy that chirped would be fun. Of course, this is a toy parrot, and saying something like ""Polly want a cracker?"" would be a more typical thing for a parrot to say. I only wish the description was accurate."
5,wonderful,Marianne Bluger is my favourite poet. Her fresh voice is a revelation. Highly recommended.
2,is this a waste?,"Why spend so much money on all the songs that are available elsewhere? Why buy so many discs with only two tracks on each disc? That's a waste of CD space. Also, they don't tell you if it's the same quality or same recording as the normal masters."
2,pleasant,"This product has a strong scent when you spray it on. We like to brush it through our dogs fur. It's pleasant for a few hours, but fades fast. Our dog does not have a strong odor. So I wonder if it would do anything for one that is odiferous. Overall for under two bucks. You can't beat it."
4,Helps bridge the gap between baths,"I have a very stinky basset hound who gets bathed weekly. By mid-week, though, she's already fairly smelly. This wouldn't work as a substitute for a bath, but it helps take away the smell for a couple of days. It's easy to use and she doesn't seem to mind it."
1,does more harm than good,"I used this product on all 3 of my pets, all with the same result. They initially smell good, but within a day they stink worse than they did before. It as if this stuff absorbs all the odors they come in contact with. I tried several more times, using less and less each time, all with the same result."
4,I will buy it again.,"Our Basset is .....well stinky. His natural smell is strong even 24 hours after a bath. I use this shampoo a few times a month, in between baths. It has a pleasant smell. While it doesn't mask his odor for long, it does a good enough job that I will buy this product again. Our furry son doesn't seem to mind when I apply it. It just takes a few minutes."
3,Good in a pinch....,"This stuff is alright, but it's not as great as I had hoped. I have a shepherd mix with medium-length fur, which can get somewhat oily. She is happy enough to have me use this on her (which is not the case with the hose!), but afterward she doesn't smell as nicely as I would like - mostly just like a wet dog who also rolled in some perfume - until she dries out, which takes awhile. Her coat usually feels a bit softer, and less oily, so that's nice, but it's certainly not even close to when she's had a real bath."
1,This is brain washing!,"Conceit, arrogance and egotism are the essentials of patriotism.... Patriotism assumes that our globe is divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate. Those who had the fortune of being born on some particular spot, consider themselves better, nobler, grander, more intelligent than the living beings inhabiting any other spot. It is, therefore, the duty of everyone living on that chosen spot to fight, kill, and die in the attempt to impose his superiority upon all others.Emma Goldman"
5,Great sample food bag...,I've been feeding my cats a mix of nutro and this product (for variety) and they all seem to love it (two kittens and an adult cat). The kibble is good sized and not too hard (so easy for the kittens to break up). The ingredients look good but I wouldn't feed as an only food for kittens (even though marketed as an all ages food).
2,Captivating,The Sword of Mohammed by Hale Meserow is definitely one of the best books I have read. I was drawn in at the very first page and my interest held on till the very end of the book. Hale Meserow is an excellent writer. I truly enjoyed his book
1,Just plain bad.,"I can't believe I wasted the time reading this book. Here's a plot:1. Orphaned boy2. Goes on a quest3. With his buddies4. Led by an elderly sage5. To prevent the spread of evil.Sound familiar? It should, it has been written thousands of times since Tolkein first published the Hobbit, et al. Some are better than others (Jordan's first 5 books, and Tad Williams); some add unique twists (Carol Berg and Lawrence Watt Evans); while some are downright miserable reads. Sadly, this book qualifies in the later category.The theme was horrid, the pacing bad, and I didn't care about one character. While I generally give an author the benefit of the doubt and read at least two or three books in a series before I pass judgment, I won't be purchasing or reading this series. Want a good book? Read Martin, Marcos, Hobbs and Watt-Evans."
2,A disappointment,"I read this book and found myself extremely disappointed by it. I thought the writing was poorly done. The book loses it's interest relatively quickly. If you are just starting out in fantasy reading, do not start with this book."
2,The tilting tower,"I went down to the store to get a good book, wanted something to read, a few month since my last book.When you buy a book, you want it to be good right, so you dont waste your time, right?Ok, this one started out a little unsure, but i have seen it before, and it use to end in very good books.The first chapters are good, the plot is not what you expect, how Mat get this ring. The characters are funny, so everything seems good so far...BUT the book is falling!It seems like the author lost his motivation and wanted it to end ASAP......or his fiancee told him that fantasy are for children, so he changed the tale so you could reed it for people at the age of ten!If you want to drown in a good book, and feel the pull of the sofa, DONT BUY THIS ONE, or even borrow it, just a waste.He is writing his second fantasy novel right now, i really hope that one has a better story and plot (for his sake)."
2,A ... Robert Jordan [imitation],"A young man. A disturbing encounter in the woods as he's off to the town festival from the farm he lives on with his Da, a widower (and formerly quite a warrior). An attack on the villagers soon after the festival by - ahem! - Orlocks. You know the rest.The innocent who discovers he is more than he thought he was, and then must deal with the challenges of a dangerous magical world is a common fantasy trope, but I really prefer reading a book where the author attempts to differentiate his work from those who have gone before. This reminded me of nothing so much as a bad knock-off of Robert Jordan's first book in the Wheel of Time series.Hopefully Graham won't try for a 10+ volume series. Jordan himself lost steam after the 4th book."
1,Don't bother,"I picked this book up because I thought it looked interesting, but then I started to read it. I don't think I got 100 pages into before I quit and I haven't touched the book since. It reminded me too much of the ""Lord of the Rings"". I half expected Gandalf to show up and say, ""Frodo, you must destroy that ring!"" So if you're familiar at all with the ""Lord of the Rings"" series, don't bother even picking this book up."
5,Top Honors,"One of the best books I've ever read. Definitely a favorite. I laughed, got teary eyes, and stayed up until the wee hours of the morning. I've been a fantasy reader all my life and can absolutely recommend ""The Fifth Ring"" to anyone who enjoys a sterling action adventure with superb characters."
2,"Slow start, odd ending","This book started slowly and the characters are introduced during a fencing tournament. In my opinion, the tournament lasted a little too long. As the story unfolds the pace does pick up a little, but there are still slow parts and overall the book is a little short on interesting dialog. The final battles are okay, but the ending came from out of nowhere and really wasn't an ending at all, but the setup for the next book."
1,One of the worst,"The worst kind of fantasy, in which no character acts or speaks like a living being and the author's mind can be felt laboring behind every plot contrivance. Buy only if you have a world-class ability to suspend disbelief."
2,Disappointing,"I completely agree with a previous reviewer that this is pretty much Robert Stanek rides again. Mitchell Graham delivers a bunch of superficial fluff in the grand style of Robert Stanek (yes, I'm mocking them both). I didn't find a single character that I identified. This is a racecar without the gas, a book all hyped up with nowhere to go. I rate this a yawn!"
5,A classic in the making,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. My initial thought was that it was a LOTR clone, but that was certainly not the case. This is a very different world with very different and realisitic characters. It's a soaring adventure story with the coming of age of it's young hero, Mathew Lewin.The author deals with morality issues quite well and the cast of characters make you want to get to know them more and more as the book progresses.I've also read (and reviewed) Graham's ""Emerald Cavern"" and can definitely give this developing series my seal of approval."
4,Great Fun for all,"One of the better books I have read in a long, long while. New writer Graham is on a par with Goodkind and Feist. Comparisons to LOTR are inevitable, but quite wrong, as this work can stand on its own nicely.I might have awarded 4.5 stars, but the theme is a common one, so I rounded down instead of up. Nevertheless, it was an extrmemly entertaining book."
5,shaolin kung fu at it's best.,"I was watching this at a telivison show. The monks are so fast I wish I had there speed. The monks ae so lovable and so campsionate. I am surpized thet don't harm themselves They have this thing called chi. I love the video. Masters of kung fu get this video now. I recomend this to everyone. Thanks, Mary E. Putnam"
5,Shaolin Wheel of Life,"This production is amazing and inspiring for all walks of martial artists. The choreography and pure talent of all the monks is humbling and unbelievable. I highly recommend this DVD for those who study martial arts, and for those who enjoy a good show. Flawless.."
1,Paloma Blanca,Not worth the money for only a single thats available on albums. Very disappointing as I thought it was the album of that name which I have on cassette and love. I was unaware it was only a single.
2,NOT FOR ALLERGIES!,"Did absolutely nothing for my dog's itch which is due to allergies. My dog was clean, but there are many other products that can do that for less $$'s"
5,Great stuff that really works,"I have tried numerous other shampoos to help with my hunting dogs scratching, itching and rashes that will develop after hunting for extended times. This stuff works immediately and is very long lasting. I would definately think this is a great product and worth every penny."
4,Works but annoying,"This is a great little product to help clear my printer out of my kitchen where I keep my laptop. It works great. Only two negatives...One is that I can only connect one computer to the printer. (Not a big deal.) The other problem is that since I installed this on my computer, there is a program that keeps trying to install at my computer start-up. I cannot seem to get it to stop. (More annoying than anything.)"
1,HP Wireless Printing Upgrade Kit,"I am unhappy with the product. It works 95% of the time with my desktop and the PC adapter included with the kit. (Resetting the connection is necessary if there is a power outage or when the printer adapter is removed and reinserted or when the printer is shut down and restarted.) The operation using my existing wireless network for a second PC (a laptop) is an unsatisfactory experience. Once I get it working, it is OK, but every time I start up the laptop and try to print it requires resetting or reconfiguraing or reinstalling the drivers. I asked HP (twice) if a separate PC adapter could be purchased (because there is no part number for it) and received no response. The wireless network operation for a second PC stinks!!"
4,Easy Wireless Printing,"The set-up was fairly simple, with easy-to-follow instructions. Initially, I had a problem because my firewall was set high and was blocking the transmission between my computer and the wireless device. Once I lowered the firewall a little bit, I had no problems. I am very happy with this product.UPDATE: After several months of using this product, it stopped working, and I have never been able to get it going again. The wireless adapter does not detect the printer. It was good while it lasted. I don't plan to buy a replacement."
1,Won't work with Dell,I have 2 HP and 3 Dell PCs in the house. This product will NOT successfully install on any of the Dells. This should be stated in the product description. Overall - NOT Satisfied
1,Couild not get it to work at all,"Though my printer was listed as supported by this device, it would not work (using WIndows XP Pro). I tired it my new computer with Windows 7 and could not even load the software. So all in all, a big waste of money."
1,HP wireless printer adapter,The adapter came through fine but it didn't work. When I contacted HP support they were not helpful at all. I can't find where to get help for this product.
2,Undisclosed Limitations,"This product may be fine for use with just one computer but it does not work as well with multiple computers. The product has two pieces one that attaches to the printer the other that attaches to a computer. if you have multiple computers they can all print to the printer without additional hardware. HOWEVER, the printer with the adapter must be on. This is setup is fine if there is one computer in your system that is always in place (e.g. a desktop), but for a system where multiple family members have laptops, this does not work well because the laptop with the adapter may not be on (and may not even be in the house)."
2,"Couldn't set it up, sent it back","I spent more than an hour trying to set this up, but I kept getting messages saying 'Unable to connect to printer'. I also found the manual difficult to follow - it was not written for averagely computer literate people like me.I went to the HP website, which told me there was no telephone support for the product. I tried chat support twice, but each time there was no reply after about ten minutes.To be fair, I did get an email apologizing for the fact that I couldn't get through and asking me to try again, but I had better things to do with my time. I sent it back, and will continue to use my time-honored method of sending documents to a remote printer, which involves walking upstairs with a USB stick."
1,Misleading Description,"I bought this wireless printer server to connect a printer to my Windows 7 PC. I read everything carefully. No where did it say it would NOT work with WIndows 7, which it will NOT. A complete waste of money. The seller should have properly described the product and stated its limitations."
1,"Doesn't work, Not Consistent, Buy the Wireless Printer","I read all the reviews before I purchased this and should have gone with my gut. I bought this and loved it for the first week or so. It worked well from everywhere in my home. Then after a few prints. It stopped working. I uninstalled it and completely started from scratch, but it still didn't work. The PC adapter no longer recognizes the printer as online. And the upgrade doesn't recognize the printer itself. Aweful. I bought the HP wireless printer. Usually HP is a great brand but this falls short, very short."
2,hp wireless review,"Great price, but does not work very well. Have to enter sometimes up to 3 times for it to print. Also, it should have a printer on feature so that you don't have to maintain your printer on 24/7. Installation was very easy,but product does tend to act up periodically. Thanks."
1,Does not work,This item does not work with my printer. I called HP and was on the phone for an hour with tech support trying to get it to work. they finally told me to go buy an new printer.Great!!
3,Did not work with my computer,"Not sure how to rate this product since I did not get a chance to use it. It wasn't compatable with my computer. Service was excellent though...no problems at all sending it back and getting refunded...However, I did notice that the item in the picture is not the same thing that I was sent. It did not come with the flash drive looking thing..."
1,Do not bother.,"Clusterfrack from start to finish. Terrible plastic blister packaging forcing one to cut open at multiple points with scissors and risk injury. Pathetic installation booklet in different languages with illustrations and little direction. Attempted to install on a desktop with XP and a laptop with Vista for use with an HP-branded printer. Inserted disc into laptop and directed to download drivers for Vista from internet. Before doing so, took to Internet for further research on product, only to discover the following:- will not work properly on my brand of computers (which are not HP)- prints two to three pages before sending job into hang mode- may bluescreen computer- will not work with Vista. They might have mentioned that somewhere on the packaging.- frustrating waste of time and money."
2,Non-compatibilitiy,This product is for use with Windows XP only. I attempted to install it on myWindows 7 laptop and was unsuccessful. The screen displayed the message that it isfor use with Windows XP only.
3,Wireless hookup,Great price but couldn't get this to work. Printer is older and I probably need additional software for Vista!
3,Disappointed a little,"I was hoping you could get two of the USB units so you could connect two computers to one printer. Other than that it is a nice addition, I would recommend if you want to alleviate cord clutter."
1,Another HP disappointment,I bought this upgrade per HP support suggestion. It is supposed to work with my HP notebook and my HP printer. After numerous hours trying to get this to work with Vista I gave up. I will NEVER buy HP again. Thanks for letting me vent.
3,"The HP Router That Never Stops Working, Even PC is Off","Reynold Dean Garrido Says; This Item Works great. The only problem I see with,Is that I'm unable to turn it off when not in use. I actually have to unpluged from the wall, And that is very inconvenience to do. Otherwise is fine."
2,Not a bargain!,"As other reviewers have noted, this is not a ""print server"" per se. It's more like a wireless USB extender. Here's why I don't recommend it:1. Special software needs to be installed on each computer in order to connect.2. It only supports one PC/Laptop at a time. If you print from multiple computers, only the first connected will be able to print.3. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect is that the reliability is poor - that is, it constantly needs to be reset. Most of the time, its faster to attach the laptop directly to the printer. I have not spent any time with firmware updates or troubleshooting, but shouldn't have to.It could be ok if you have just one computer and a lot of patience, otherwise save yourself the headache and spend the extra money for a bona fide print server."
2,good product when it worked,Amazon was great with the service aspect. the product arrived on time with no problem and installed quick but after a few days stoped working. in the process of trying to report the problem to HP to get a new one.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,"Piece of JUNK! The wireless upgrade will not work with WiFi, cordless phone, Bluetooth, or VPN network. Can you tell me what kind of office does not have one if not ALL of these? The intereference disconnects the wireless printer connection. And yes, before returning I thought I could try using it on my Mac - NOPE. Not compatible. 45 minutes on the phone with HP Support so that the tech could explain to me how to buy a longer phone cord - which wasn't my problem in the first place. I just don't want my USB cord draped across my office with my printer/fax sitting in the middle of the floor! Don't waste your time and money - you'll have to return it anyway. Mine is going back today!"
1,Junk that won't work and Isn't Supported by HP,"If you like ordering something, only to return it because it won't work, isn't supported, and commitments made to you by a Support Center to have someone call you back with a fix for a known problem are ignored, you'll love the HP Wireless Printing Upgrade Kit. I don't know if it works with Windows XP but I do know that trying to make it work as advertised with Vista isn't possible. I've made a promise to myself to never buy another HP product."
1,A dowgrade Kit - Don't buy it,"The product sucks, doesn't work like the marketing messages from HP, and the support services from HP are useless.I have wasted 6 hours trying to make it work but it's really not worthed.Buy a printer with the wireless interface already in place."
1,beware of first class books - they will sell you solutions manual instead of text,beware of first class books - they will sell you solutions manual instead of text
1,I did not enjoy this book,"Manana: Christian Theology from a Hispanic Perspective, was not useful. I come from a Hispanic Backround and was completely confused."
3,Mixed Bag...,"The book approaches Pakistan from a number of perspectives, segregated into different sections, just as Cohen's does. This strategy helps break down a very complex subject into realistic portions, as well as allow the reader to choose what angle -- e.g., foreign relations, military, political -- to concentrate on in any one time. HOWEVER, the book is either poorly written or poorly translated or both: at best, the writing is stilted and dense, and not fast-going; at worst, you might have to go back over a sentence or paragraph just to figure out what is trying to be said or if there is a point to the paragraph. Really, I don't expect poor writing style to be an issue in commercially published books, but this is an exception. This being said, it is a wealth of info if you are willing to slog through it. Go with Cohen's book first."
4,A definite Help,"This product did what I wanted but I had to trim it down to fit my Sears table saw. It would have been nice to know what all the dimensions were before I ordered it. It was a definite help in make many narrow cuts, supporting the lumber alll the way up to the blade."
3,Truth is even stranger than these tales,"Sailing superstitions, ghosts pirates, haunted lighthouses, sea monsters, even ghost ships - real of not? All good tall tales are based on a scrap of truth. Blackbeard and others now seen as ghosts actually existed. Sea monsters may be species thought to be extinct. Mostly no explanations are given for the hows; but the stories of hearing voices when no one is there, objects moved, and ships appearing in the clouds are enough for a mild creepout. The truth is even weirder - for example, Blackbeard's skull was coated with silver and used as a drinking cup by a college fraternity. Photos, pen and ink drawings, bibliography, and index are included. Teachers may use this in a number of ways but there is not enough information for long reports"
5,Best Dried Pasta I've Ever Cooked,"I cook a lot of pasta, but don't have the time or patience to make my own. This is the finest dried pasta I have ever cooked. My guests always agree. It has a chewiness and ability to hold sauce that is outstanding. Rarely sticks (only if you totally ignore it in the pot.) Worth the effort--far above the best usual store brands."
4,"Nothing but an ""illustrated history"" of celtic history","There's a huge caveat with this book I thought I would have known before purchasing it. This book is an illustrated history of the world of the celts, not a traditional academic book in any sense of the term. Granted, the entries are very thorough, but the fact that it is encyclopaedic rather that in essay-style takes away any perspective or conclusiveness one might find in a regular history book."
4,A surprising good little book,Although someone skimpy on information in places this book is a fairly good introduction and also should have a place in anyone's Celtic library. The illustration depicting the handle assembly of a La Tene sword is alone worth the price of the book for those interested in the archeological artifacts of the Celts.
5,Phenomenal Book a Must Read for any Celt Addict,Beautifully written and illustrated history. Kept me compelled to read on in this beautiful text.
3,its ok nothing special,the first half of this book was pretty good but the last half was not good.the good thing about this book is that the authors detail the situations pretty good.the bad part is that the story is pretty boring.there are better horror books out there.
1,A Werewolf Book Without Any Claws Or Fangs!,"My Mother comes from the Black Forest in Germany where the Legend Of The Werewolf originated so I was hoping for a good read in this book but I was very disappointed. If you take away the elements of the Supernatural, the Graphic and Gratuitous Sex and the Extreme Violence all you are left with is this loser who falls in love with a crazy woman.That's all there is to this story and as an aside it also promotes unsafe sex if the woman is attractive enough which I think is highly irresponsible."
5,Animals the movie coming out this summer!,"This is an awesome book and I recently found out that a movie has been made. The release date is June 15, 2010. The cast is amazing and includes actors such as Eva Amurri (Californication) and Naveen Andrews (Lost). I had the opportunity to prescreen the movie and it was well done. Make sure to check your local retailers; Blockbuster, BestBuy, Netflix, Walmart, and Redbox around the second week of June.Here is some info about the film: [...]*Sponsored Post"
5,"Raw, Extreme, Visceral, Exhilarating, sexy as hell","All of these words describe this book! Animals draws you in from first chapter. The characters are well defined, gritty, smoky, hard drinking, hard screwing, raw meat eating, bad people that your parents warned you about!! It makes you want to go out and howl at the full moon. Skipp and Spector deserve the title splatter punks. They have come out again with a book that should be on the top 50 of anyones list of great horror."
1,Time to say God Why?,"This yawn-inducing book literally made me fall asleep every time I picked it up. Not joking, literally. It's hard to believe that the same Gould who wrote an amazing book like Dazzle wrote this piece of dreck, but that's what it says on the cover.The plot of this book is basically that one woman is dying and she wants to hook her husband up with another chick so he can be happy and have a family after she's passed away. The dying woman hires this chick to decorate a grotto, and you will never forget that there is a grotto, cause it's all they bleepin' talk about when they aren't talking about orchids, equally as boring a subject. Where is the human drama? Oh, that's right, it's non-existent. Even when issues come up it's as if they're not happening, because none of these characters are the least bit real. Everyone is just a name on a page, the words forever reminding you that they are just words.Oh yeah folks, it's a failure."
1,Lousy Book,"What drivel! I wonder if it was as boring to write as it was to read. If I were keeping track of authors to avoid, this one would be at the top of my list."
1,something new for me,It really wasn't that bad. considering that this is the first book i've bought of this sort so i'm not really sure what else to say.
4,Nice,"This is a very flattering bodysuit. The fabric is hoisery style, inexpensive type - but looks fabulous. The neck is snug, but not uncomfortable. I would reccomend this one."
4,Conservatively naughty,"The quality is good and the price is right, shipping and arrival excellent. It tends to run a bit small, making for a nice snug fit. So why not five stars? Well, this bodysuit just wasn't as sexy as I thought. The high neck gives it a formality that just does not seem right for bedroom play. I am glad I bought it, however. My girlfriend wears this slinky teddy under a starched white shirt with a dark pencil skirt. The hint of sexy daring stands out when paired with a conservative outfit."
4,Beautiful but not the best material,"I really love the swirl pattern of this set, and also the way it feels. It is very fitted, I'm a size 4 and I even questioned if I would fit into it, when you just unfold it from the packet it is only about 6in wide. You put it on over your head, stretch it over your body and then snap it closed under the crotch. When stretched it was very flattering without even the slightest hint of muffin topping, however I've only worn it once and it already has a small hole in it. I can't be sure if that was already there or if it developed as/after I put it on.The stockings I will use with other sets because they're quite interesting and I love running my hands over the material."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE CAKE STANDS,"I recently purchased these cake stands to use for my wedding cake. (I thought I would be unique and do three layers on seperate stands rather than one cake layered on top of each other.) However, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I opened the box to find the stands broken. One of the legs had fallen off. The material itself looks very cheap and was already bent out of shape--and I never even took it out of its plastic wrapping. I would STRONGLY advise anyone against ordering this cake stand. I personally am sending the one I just bought back. Please don't waste your time and money like I did."
2,Disappointing,"Even though this book sounded promising, it was in the end very disappointing. There are a few problems. Firstly, the references are organized poorly, I would like to have seen listings under for example 'piano technique', 'interpretation', 'biographies','piano history', etc. Instead it is just one very long alphabetical list with some limited cross-references at the end that are not practical to use. Secondly, a lot of references are to quite obscure. Finally, there is no advice at all, it is purely a listing, and thus no value is added by the author. I think the idea of the book is excellent, but it needs revamping!"
4,Effective Thrush Remedy,"I recommend Hooflex Equine Thrush Remedy because it works. You get a lot for the price. It's not sticky, nor does it stain your clothes. However, there is a garlic sent that is not pleasant. The thrush I treated was gone in less than a week. This is a highly effective product. (4 stars instead of 5 because of the smell)"
1,The Movie is Way Better!,"The Movie is better. How could they turn Beautiful Spot or any of they other beautiful boys into dorks? Although it does include pics from the movie, this book goes against all that is Newsie and I would like to object it on the grounds of Brooklyn! Brooklyn"
3,"A must-have for any Newsies fan, of any age.","I would recommend this only to the biggest Newsies fans, which happen to be any Internet Newsies fan I think...it's more like the original script than the finished product(Spot was originally written as a freckle faced, toad-y little guy). Of course, it *is* a junior novelization, so it's very childish and should take the average Newsies fan less than a day to skim through and read. I'm 19, and I do kind of enjoy reading through it every once and awhile. It has all the major plot points and scenes in it, and a few extras. One interesting thing is that the cover they chose is a blooper photo. Kid Blink's eye-patch in the photo is just above his eye, and both of his eyes are visible. Heck, it's worth it just to see that! Bottom line, any self-respecting Newsies fanatic should have a copy of this little gem *somewhere* in their home."
2,If you're looking for.....,".... a book exactly like the movie, this isn't it. (But then, most movies turned into books, or books turned into movies aren't exactly alike, either.) Events are slightly changed, and certain characters are developed more than they are in the movie..... the history behind the newsboys strike of 1899, which is what the book and movie are about, look somewhere else. While they have done a little bit of research into the strike, the information presented in the notes at the back isn't accurate. I'd suggest doing a internet search for City Hall Park (a web site about the history of the strike) or go to newsies-movie.com for more historical information."
1,ICK!,"Ok, this book was positively wretched! I hated it! I'm not trying to be rude, but it was completely different from the movie, and on top of that, they made the characters seem like dorks! I mean, they turned my beautiful spot to a freckle faced red head! How can you possibly like a book that isn't anything at all like the movie! Not to mention, they told us what really happened! I didn't want to know that they actually lost, nor did I want to know that Spot Conlon didnt' really exist, or did i want to know that most of the characters didn't exist either!"
3,eh,hmmmmmmmmm...the book seemed a little below the reading level of the average Newsies-watcher. The plot of the movie is so complicated and the book is so simple and boring that it's hardly worth the money...the change the story and characters completely...stick with the movie.
4,Sountrack vs Broadway cast,"Being a huge Julie Andrews fan it is hard to be objective about the film and soundtract. 'My Fair Lady' as a film and soundtrack does not cut it for me, however 'Camelot' is a jewell in the crown for both Warner Bros and Lerner & Lowe. Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave are perfectly cast, and the words and music resonate to such a degree that the actors translate without being great singers like Andrews. I love this peice! And highly recommend the DVD and Soundtrack!"
2,Camelot soundtrack,"I enjoyed listening to the CD however I thought I was ordering the movie on DVD,, I will try again"
3,Camelot is Alive,"If you follow my reviews you will find that I enjoy newer, less classical musicals usually. HOWEVER, Camelot was certainly enjoyable to listen to. The songs are enjoyable and give a nice outline of the show, the singers are pleasant, the lyrics are pleasing and clever. While listening to the two recordings of Camelot I own, I decided that this recording is better than theCamelot (1960 Original Broadway Cast)1960 recording. I came to this conclusion because the singers on this album have more personality which makes the show more real for the listener. I am in no way saying the 1960 recording isn't good, this one is just better. Fav song: ""If Ever I Should Leave You"""
5,Good Transaction,"They shipped it pretty fast. It was the right version (the soundtrack to the film with Richard Harris, not the Harris or Burton play versions). Item was exactly as described - unopened in factory wrap and in perfect condition. no complaints, good, easy transaction"
4,Richard Harris owned this role,I saw him live when was older and he actually was better as Arthur. Almost staged like a play with nice images with only a few scenes over the top with symbolism
2,Only for the Movie Lovers,"If you liked the movie, Camalot, with Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris, go ahead and buy this album. The technical quality is good. However, if you didn't, Camalot, 1960 Original Broadway Cast, is much more satisfying in my view (or ear). Julie Andrews and Richard Burton can sing with greater richness and better pitch, and are wonderful on this recording. After umpteen years listening to the vinyl Original Cast, I ""upgraded"" my collection with a CD by buying the Movie Soundtrack based upon reviews at Amazon. I have tried listening to it many times, but I don't think those people sing well. I am now buying the Original Cast."
3,Leaves a lot out,"This is, of course, the original lp album which was released at the time the movie was. while i especially liked all the songs, the album left out most of the overture, as well sa intermission and exit music.I would like to see an exapnded version of this score, which shouldn't be too hard to do."
5,one of the best there is in jazz,"I need to write a review because I see there are not any.I've been enjoying this as an lp for about 23 years. Perhaps my second favorite jazz recording next to Kind of Blue.This is a very mellow recording. The most understated jazz I know of. Good for late night listening.John Lewis and Bill Perkins are excellent on this recording. And Jim Hall is perhaps even more outstanding. These guys gel together and play so well, perhaps like they never have done individually. They must be feeding off each other. Perhaps John Lewis is the genius behind this recording.I see it is not an inexpensive recording here. But if you love undestated mellow jazz, you won't find better."
1,Buy extra warranty!,"The processor was only guaranteed for a year--it malfuntioned within a month after the first year. Now we have 2 inch lines on the screen, one red and one green."
5,really important book,"This book is well written, engaging and important for both teachers and parents of young children. The information is available in oother books, but this one is easy to read and well done!"
5,One of greatest Rollins' releases,"In my opinion ""The Bridge"" is one of the two Rollins' greatest recordings ever, another one is of course ""Saxophone Collossus"". It opened to us, young jazz musicians of those days, a new dimensions in jazz. What struck me most was a unique transparency of rythmic background which rythm section was providing. It was done by very laconic but impressive chord play of Jim Hall, accurate swing of Ben Riley. Rollins' solos were very profound, full of feelings. This marks them noticeably from what he plays nowdays. Jim Hall was very young and full of energy and apart from elegant chord support also produced a number of beautiful solos of his own. I would recommend everybody who likes Rollins and Hall to buy this recording."
3,Good Information If You Can Afford It,"The baby-proofing information in this video was good, but relied almost exclusively on buying specific, often pricey, products for your home. By the time the video is through, the viewer will have to spend hundreds of dollars to purchase all of the recommended gadgets. The video was shot in a ""real"" house (closer to a mini-mansion, really) that most ""average"" viewers will have trouble relating to. Less well-off parents who may not be able to afford all of the bells and whistles presented here are given no alternative methods for making their home a safer place without busting their budget."
3,"Works, but very disappointing","Pros:- Price (whiteboards are very expensive)- One inch square rules are clean and clearCons:- Too flexible- Doesn't erase as easily as a ""real"" whiteboard (especially colors)- Too thin for low-strength magnets to stick- Looks cheapThis whiteboard is literally a very thin steel sheet sandwiched between white paper and then laminated. The lamination is the same quality you get from a home laminator, including the little clear flap all around the outside of the board where the two films seal together. The steel is so thin that the whiteboard can be rolled up into a tube about 8"" in diameter. E.g. you can not lean the whiteboard up against a wall and small flexible magnets don't stick very securely."
3,6 Million Dollar Majors!,This show was really good at first. The early episodes including the pilot were top notch. Then it kind of got off into the goofy 70's Bigfoot genre and came off the rails. But its got a great cast and Lee Majors was the man!
4,Excellent book for touring kayakers,"I mistakenly bought this book to help me get started with recreational kayaking. I found this fascinating, comprehensive, and well-written, but duhh -- I should have paid more attention to the subtitle: (Sea Kayaking How-To). I doubt I will ever get into kayaking on this level, but for people who want to know everything about heading off into the wild blue yonder in a kayak, it would be an excellent choice! I would *love* to find a Kayaking for Dummies book. From my point of view, most of the books out there are geared to outdoor gear-head types in good shape. I'm a 49-year-woman who wants to paddle the slow, spring-fed rivers of the Texas hill country and need something much more basic than this."
3,"""A picture is worth a thousand words...""","A very useful book, but the author insists on taking two paragraphs to describe a technique or motion that could be conveyed in a single picture or diagram. The few pictures that are in the book are very indistinct. It's no mystery why authors do this. It's much easier and cheaper to type an extra dozen sentences than to have an artist develop an appropriate graphic. Too bad, though, as the section on paddling would have benefited from some simple illustrations. As it is, there are perhaps four or five actual diagrams and they really don't contribute much to the book."
4,Great Beginners Guide!,"I found this book interesting, entertaining, and informative. The author is witty and his descriptions are excellent.Rebecca ""New Kayaker"""
3,Flamingo Beach Towel,"I bought two of these adorable beach towels as I have a thing for flamingos and though the size is big enough, the towels are on the thin side and a bit scratchy. I bought them more for fun and the picture on them than for serious beach towels usage."
5,Fantastic video,"MTT takes us on a journey to Russia to see with our own eyes the apartment building where Shostakovich lived and wrote this symphony, as well as the hallway where he slept so as to not awaken his family when the secret police came (as he expected) to take him away in the dead of night. The conductor takes us through each movement of the symphony, highlighting key passages and how he interprets their meaning. One of the focal points of his analysis is the ending of the final movement, which on the surface sounds triumphant but which has since been analyzed differently by many interpreters, including MTT. Then the disc concludes with a masterful performance of the symphony. All in all, a musical and musicological tour de force. Highly recommended for any lover of this 20th century masterpiece."
1,Not an All Regions BD,"This blu-ray disc is wrongly advertised as an All Regions disc on the Amazon.com website. However, it is a Region 1 disc. And since I do not own a blu-ray player that can decode such discs (I live in Chile), I cannot enjoy them (by the way, thanks Hollywood big shots for the wonderful idea of implementing these annoying codes). I did get my refund from Amazon allright, but that wasn't the point: I wanted to enjoy this disc. So, be warned."
1,Why do I get opened/returned one for 'purchasing new'?,"I got this one in a different plastic wrap from the other BD(Barenboim Beethoven Piano Concerti) and it had a finger print and minor scratches on the recorded side. This makes me think I should stay away from Amazon, and Amazon system is basically unable to accomodate complaint and demand for discount, only laborious and lame full refund process."
5,fontaine foxs toonerville trolley,excellent book alsowonderful service from amazom and book dealers very happy with results thanks again doug dakin
1,You can break it by looking at the tip.,"I've bought hundreds of things on Amazon and thousands of things elsewhere. This is the first one to motivate me to review. The thing doesn't really work. You can see from the other reviews as well that it isn't a case of ""dumb malcontent user error."" The $9 replacement tip thing really does look like a scam, whether intended or not; that is what it amounts too.Truly pathetic. Some lawyer must be looking into a class action lawsuit by now.I doubt I will buy anything from Coleman from now on."
1,The Worst of the Worst.,This is the worst tool of any sort that I have ever bought. After an entire hour spent trying to solder the negative wire of my car speaker to its post I destroyed this monstrosity beyond all recognition. Very Cathartic. I want 5 minutes alone with whomever invented this and charged me 13$ for it...
1,"Cold, but not heat","This is a totally useless tool. It has failed at every application I have attempted. It looks so convenient and handy, but you will end up pulling out a real soldering iron if you want to do any work.Should not even be on the market, typical TV hype product. A waste of batteries."
1,I think about this product and laugh!,Yes I got duped also. This thing didn't even melt the solder! I ordered three of them thinking they would make great gifts. Once I found out how pathetic these are I called them and wanted my money back. I said I would be happy to send them back for a refund. But they didn't even want them. they said keep them and they credited my account. So I ended up giving them as gag gifts! At least I got a laugh out of them!
1,Severely Truncated,"This edition of ""The Joyless Street"" is a severely truncated version of the film. It runs for about 60 minutes, which includes a brief introduction. Yes, there are many versions of this film out there which vary widely in length--the only other version I've seen is the longer and more complete Kino VHS--but this has got be one of the shortest. Almost all the material with Asta Nielsen is excised. The disc lists the runtime at 90 minutes for some reason. Beware."
1,do not buy this version,"This particular version of JOYLESS STREET is described as running 126 minutes, which is the running time of the best-restored version of the film. However, in actual fact, this VHS from Timeless Video is the truncated 60-minute version. SO DO NOT BE FOOLED. JOYLESS STREET features the stories of two women: the daughter of an immpoverished army veteran and the daughter of a retired civil servant. Both have fallen on hard times in the post-WWI era and both feel responsible enough for their families to compromise their morality in exchange for food and the trappings of wealth. Greta Garbo plays the daughter of the civil servant, and, after she moved to Hollywood and became famous, the film was re-released to feature her, practically eliminating the second and far more tragic story. So, while I highly recommend the fully restored version of the film, I want to warn buyers to be sure that that is the version they are getting. This one is not it."
5,Early Garbo - Always Wonderful,"Perhaps the only reason why this film is remembered is for Greta Garbo's performance. However, this story about the tough times in Vienna after the First World War is worth a look in itself. Garbo appears in one of the film's sub-plots and, as noted, considers becoming a prostitute to make ends meet. Her father looses all his money but she is saved by a Red Cross officer who loves her. Things do get quite tense and Garbo's performance is a highlight of the film.As for the ""The Joyless Street"" being deary, I would say it gives us a picture of the times, which were bad indeed in Germany and Austria. Pabst was a master film maker and his subjects, like the later Pandora's Box, explore the seemy side of society. It is melodramatic at times but an interesting film that devotees of silent films will not want to be without.The film quality is excellent and the music admirably fits the subject."
1,Poor transfer & Missing Scenes,The other reviewer is right in calling this severely truncated -- it's missing several vital scenes. And the Kino VHS has better image quality. Wish I had watched it sooner so I could return it. Save your money!
1,a travesty of a reat movie,"My ratingt relates to the DVD, not the film. The seller did not mention that this is the heavily cut 61 minute version that eradicates the Asta Nielsen story completely, thus removing Werner Kraus from the film as well, apart from the butcher shop scene early on. Some omission! and information that the prospective purchaser needs to know. And it states on the box that the movie is 1 hour 30 minutes long ... most misleading. And the Mozart becomes very irritating after a while, it's so inappropriate in its unrelenting jolliness .. I watched the film silent after ten minutes of it ... there is a place for everything, and Mozart and Pabst's Joyless Street are in different solar systems ...."
5,fantastic record of weimar german cinema,"Whether you are a Garbo fan or interested in Germany during the 1920s, the film is a dramatization of conditions that then existed. This was Garbo's second screen performance and it's outstanding. Never seen anything else that captured the period so well. Very interesting and well worth the expense."

4,1 short,"I was really looking forward to this coming in the mail till they showed up, the packaging was ripped apart, one of my packs was missing and another card i ordered with these was out of the case and a little bent. I will not buy from here again."
2,worse packets ever,do not buy this it was a waste of money...the highest attack monster i got was 2200 and he sucks the traps were okay but the monsters suck!
3,Not bad but leatherman is better.,Overall this is not a bad little keychain tool but the locking mechanism is somewhat difficult to operate and seems more likely cause someone problems than if it just didn't have a locking feature. I ended up going back to using myLeatherman 64010103K Micra Multitooland I find it much more useful.
3,mediocre,"Not so impressive. The ""locking"" mechanism is easily overcome with a little pressure and the tools fall partly out when the tool is closed. Spend a few more bucks on a Leatherman squirt that will last a lifetime."
2,"cheap, poorly made copy of Sebertool M4","M4 Sebertool isn't available any longer, unfortunately.If anyone finds those still for sale I'd buy several to have spares.This is cheap copy of it: ""IDL Tools T10 Multitool""you can find those from $16 online to twice that at SearsLooks like cheaply made with hand tools:-- blade sharpened with a flat file on one side only, instead of with a concave grind on both sides-- Philips screwdriver head shaped with a flat file, instead of concave grind (so doesn't fit into smaller screws)-- blade locking buttons hand-peened leaving rough heads, instead of machine-pressedIt's ok for a cheap copy."
2,Very handy and sturdy tool.,I did not purchase this item from Amazon but at a local electronics store. Same product but different brand name. M4 Seber Tool is the name on my version of this product. The pliers is very useful. Already saved a fellow driver from going nuts during a long trip because one of the fuse in his minivan failed causing his windshield wiper to stop working. This tool fit perfectly in the fuse box enabling the driver to pull out the bad fuse and replace it with a spare.UPDATE: I had a chance to see the IDL T10 at a local shop. It is a cheap copy of the M4. The metal they use looks like anodized aluminum. The pliers head are not properly aligned. And it's made in China.
1,Broken,The scorpion sucker arrived with candy portion of sucker shattered. Item was not packed carefully. That was very very disappointing.
3,Scorpion is real!,"I bought this sucker from a museum thinking that the scorpion would be encased in plastic and gave it to my three year old. Good thing I was sitting beside her as her lick revealed the front leg of the scorpion! I stuck the lollies in water and out emerged the scorpions! Crazy! They need to be clear that the scorpion is meant to be eaten. Overall it was cool, but I have the chills thinking my three year old almost ate a scorpion!"
1,Item was not the same as the one pictured/described,The picture shows an 1120 mAh battery. The description says 850 mAh. The battery recieved was 720mAh. I hope Amazon fixes this soon. I expect better from them.
1,Not what was describe,The picture for this product shows a 1120 mAh battery and the product description lists it at 850 mAh. I actually received a battery that says it is 720 mAh.
3,Good for the price,"I bought two of these batteries and received an Olympus brand battery with my new Olympus camera. These batteries work fine, but last only 1/2 to 3/4 as long as the Olympus battery. Even after several discharge/charge cycles, as recommended, the battery life is less than the Olympus brand. For the price, they are still a great deal, and I had no problems with the shipment I received."
2,Power2000 a replacement battery for 770SW camera,"As a OEM replacement battery, very good price, but beaware of the 740mAh compare to the original battery 1000mAh which supplied with the camera.It only give you half of the battery time. overall: $5 for a spare bettery , it's OK"
5,Replacement Battery Olympus FE280,"Why buy a new battery from Olympus for $45 when you can get a more powerful battery for less than half (cheaper when on special)! We use our FE280 so much the battery doesn't last very long, and since you must remove it to put in the charger, it's a no-brainer to use another one while charging the first."
3,Product Fine,"I am happy with the product, it was as advertised. I do however wonder why the shipper choose to ship in two separate envelopes and charging shipping on both rather than putting both batteries in one."
1,use the web,"This book tries to cover so many things it ends up covering nothing. Apache is addressed on Unix, Linux, Windows, and Mac platforms giving no depth to any single one. Literally half the book is appendices with some covering things like TCP/IP concepts and network troubleshooting. It's all over the map. No focus or usefulness.The e-commerce section (the reason I bought the book) is a joke. Only 30 pages with 20 of them devoted to a sample site using PHP.There are a lot of pages on the Web that do a much better, more focused, job of covering this material and it won't cost you anything. Rarely have I ever been this disappointed in a book."
2,"A lot of historical info, but poor presentation","I'm really interested in mead and have made my own. I like to read about mead and its history, but I found this book somewhat inaccessible. It was an absolute chore to read. I wish the information had been presented in an interesting manner. Nonetheless, the brief section in the back of the book is somewhat helpful to homebrewers interesting in making mead."
2,Not What I Expected!,"In a way this CD blows, but in another way, it's good! When I bought this CD several years ago (2002), I thought there'd by some Tex Beneke vocals; but instead, all the vocals are by Ray Eberle, Dorothy Claire (subbing for Marion Hutton) and the Modernaires. The rest are instrumentals.If you want good Tex Beneke vocals, try else where, but don't look here. Try the ""Golden Greats"" CD (""My Melancholy Baby,"" song 17, CD 3) and ""Glenn Miller And His Orchestra"" (""The Lady's In Love With You,"" song 4, CD 1 and ""The Little Man Who Wasn't There,"" song 11, CD 1).And for better Ray Eberle vocals, do the same -- look for another CD. Or if you're a big Ray Eberle fan and want a CD with mostly his songs on it, than buy this."
3,My weapon against tartar,"I am using this product for my own mouth and have been very pleased with the results. True enough, I have not had any tartar since rinsing with it. My teeth are also brighter.However, I wish that the Tartar Control properties came in their 'less intense' versions. The artic mint version even gets a little too intense for me sometimes and other times I just would like to switch out but cannot under dentist orders."
2,Buy the other one...,"I've been a fan of this show for a long time. I'm a fan of Flaherty & Ahrens in general. This recording just doesn't seem worth it. The performances are certainly no better than the original recording. Malcolm Gets is definitely not better than the original Mr.Witherspoon (how did he get away with that accent?). The most glaring absence for me is the orchestra. A piano-only accompaniment sounds like ""rehearsal."" The inclusion of material that was cut from the original album is not reason enough to buy this CD. My advice...buy the original."
3,Okay,Pretty good overall. Well illustrated and the program works for the most part. It does seem rather close the the Charles Atlas program and I wonder if the author may have actually taken from Atlas. The author's sons look great but the author looks a bit fat which makes me wonder if he practices what he preaches. It is worth a try but not the best body weight only book out there.
1,Too much boasting....,"Jim Forystek is breaking some fundamental principles of fitness in this book. I was very disappointed after I read it...The boys in the pics have (over)developed pecs, the rest of the arms and body are very underdeveloped. Yes the boys are lean, but that is pretty much it..That is the result that powerflex delivers?If you want a good book about bodyweighttraining, get John Peterson's books. They are LIGHTYEARS ahead of this sorry excuse of a fitness book.."
4,Very Useful,"Great book with very detailed examples on the relationship between different fixed income instruments. My only complaint (and it is a very minor one) is lack of problems at the end of each chapter to help solidify the concepts. Otherwise, an excellent book."
3,Watchable fare but not suitible for repeat viewing,Tv's Hercules stars as Kull in this sword and scorcery pic that features some decent special effects but the dumbed-down toned-down script and performances lack the punch and brutality required to make this film about barbarians very credible.
2,Disappointing to a Robert E Howard fan,"As I expected when I found out that kevin sorbo was starring, this film took a classic Robert E. Howard legend and turned it into a laughable, PG-13-rated flick for Xena/Hercules-watching-kids. While the effects were good, and Tia definately was hot.. I felt like I wanted a refund for going to see it. Having read all of the original R. E. Howard material, I have to say that this effectively misrepresents the stories. Kull shouldn't make jokes, shouldn't speak perfect English (he's a barbarian, for god's sakes). Not enough realistic violence, too much humor, too light-hearted, not enough suspense. Not satisfactory. Come on boys, you can do better than this.."
5,Kull,"Another great story by Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan the Barbarian. Kevin Sorbo is not Arnold, but the story is pretty nice and follows Howard's original story published more than 40 years ago. Nice price at Amazon."
3,entertaining while not much else,"I have seen Kevin Sorbo in Hercules and like Hercules he does good with the role that has been given to him. Though Kull is the son of Conan there is surprisingly no reference to that in the movie. So do you need to see the Conan movies before watching this? Absolutely not. In fact, I think Kull the Conqueror is better than the Conan movies. Though not superb, this movie does manage to entertain. Tia Carrere does good playing the evil and seductive ressurected queen who Kull has to defeat in order to save the kingdom he wants to rule. If you like movies based on fantasy/mythology, check this one out. Though the music and sense of humor are a bit far fetched considering the time of which Kull the Conqueror takes place, this still makes for a decent flick."
3,A cult classic with nice pectorals.,"A fun, laid-back flick (one can't really call it a ""film"") that doesn't pretend to be more than it is. Enthusiasts expecting a macho-thriller-blood bath with lots of scantily-clad nymphs will be disappointed, but only slightly. The movie doesn't stoop to that level. Quite. The heavy metal during the fight scenes was a nice touch."
3,The difference being.....,"I didn't really have a problem with this movie. The whole thing was based on a character from Robert E. Howard novels (who technically is an ancestor to Conan of Cimmeria), had one of the same producers involved with the Conan movies, and the ORIGINAL soundtrack being hard and thunderous, enough to do Conan proud. I had no problem with this film, save for one thing....Kevin Sorbo.Yes, Mr. Pretty boy Hercules himself is placed into the role of Kull of Atlantis, ancestor to Conan the Barbarian, actually trying to play himself off as a barbarian. Would've been more believable to me had they gone with Lou Ferrigno, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or, dare I say, perhaps even Triple H. Apart from that one minute detail, the movie was terrific."
4,THIS IS A REALLY GREAT 'B' FILM!,"We can't survive on high-falutin', high concept movies alone we need our junkfood and that is what Kull is.The movie knows what it is and so doesn't take itself to seriously, it moves fast and thankfully doesn't over stay it's welcome which is a must for a film like this (as well as non stop action).It's silly, fun and entertaining, with good productuion values and a tight plot with good actors.The DVD isn't quite the best I've seen but is all around better when compared to the movie on my dish.Would I recommend it? Yes it's a fun movie, but only if you enjoy some well done junkfood."
1,"Okay for first ten minutes, awful from there on out","Boy, Kull the Conqueror is a really bad movie. There's no other way to put it. Director John Nicolella can't do much with an amateurish screenplay that could have been written by a twelve year old. The cast suffers even more, with terrible and wooden performances delivered all throughout the torturous 90 minute running time. Kevin Sorbo delivers the closest thing to a respectable performance, but even then he's forced to say some really inane dialogue and do some really stupid things.Action-wise, Kull is definitely not something to put on top of your list for adrenaline-pumping fights. Everything in such a straightforward fashion that all the fights and moves are predictable. Granted, it's not badly choreographed but it's not much fun, either. I have a lot of other things about this movie to complain about, but I think I've made my point. Kull is simply an awful movie."
1,WOW,"Two words: Full On Demon Makeout. OK so that was four words. Retarded right? You too can be within two to three business days, just order this DVD and ship it via Amazon Prime to your house."
1,Kevin Sorbo in: Krap the Borer,"Simply put, this movie sucked. It tried to take the effects of Hercules and put it into a movie. Sorry, it didn't work. This movie had terrible acting (if you want to call it acting), a predictable plot that a bunch of drunks probably got together to make, and just lacked in everything from dialouge to action. My recommendation is not to watch, listen about, talk about, or even think about this movie or you'll just get dumber."
2,Fries with that?,"This really isn't much of a movie. It isn't particularly enjoyable at all - perhaps most damaging is the acting from pretty much everyone involved. They come off as fast food employees rather than mythic characters - would you like fries with that slashing?Thoroughly disappointing.The plot itself isn't too shabby, but the dialogue is abysmal, and the whole thing just isn't put together very well.On the whole it has the look of an episode of a television show rather than a feature.The 96 minutes pass by quickly enough, but... there are better ways to employ that time."
5,OMG,"What can you say but he is fantastic. He is talented, smart, good looking, tall.I enjoyed this movie very much. It didn't take off as well as it should have. You have a fan here."
3,should have been better,This movie would have been so much better if they would have left out the terrible rock music. It did not fit this film at all. The rest of the music was fine. Maybe the filmmakers will learn from their mistakes. I don't think there will be another one in the series!
2,Painful,"I'm easily entertained - it's hard to make a movie I can't enjoy, but this one managed... Take Conan, remove the darkness and sense of high adventure add in Kevin Sorbo and a plastic axe.I liked the soundtrack in a way - not exactly good listening but it was fun to see the big fights set to rock music - interesting experiment and not too bad an effect. But I keep seeing that stupid fight scene in an ice cave - obviously plastic weapons, irritatingly silly fight and boring (anti)climax.Skip it, not worth the walk to the store, let alone hard earned dollars. Sorry Kevin, stick with Hercules."
4,Great lightweight entertainment,"Granted it isn't Shakespeare, Hitchcock or even Carpenter, but this was a fun show to watch. It helps to turn off the right-side of your brain, and just enjoy the action, sets, babes and monsters."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,What a mistake this puchase was. It brought down my system 4 times and when it did work it was as slow as dirt. I had to buy the CD to try to save some of the many hours I wasted the the zip disk. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!
1,demora na chegada do produto,"Até o momento no chegou o medicamento no Brasil e já caiu o pagamento no meu carto de crédito, isso é um absurdo...sei que está no prazo, mas no deveria cair na fatura do carto até realmente ter certeza que chegou...."
5,Saved My Dog's Life,"I have a small 12 yr old death row pound rescue that started to fail so quickly that I was making plans for euthasia and cremation. I took the dog to the vet thinking she had diabetes but blood tests showed a borderline liver problem (elevated enzymes.) My vet was gone on Friday when I found out about this drug from my mother, whose dog was saved by this drug, but I couldn't get in touch with the vet.The vet wanted to wait another 6 weeks then retake her blood. I thought, she won't live that long at this rate.Since it is non RX I just went ahead and ordered it on a Friday night.By Monday it was here and I started her on it immediately. That was March 17. As of the 26th, she's 100% better, eating like a wolf, lots of energy AND buying from Amazon is half the price or less than the vet would charge. It costs about $21.47 a month.Thank you Amazon!!!"
4,Denosyl for small dogs,"my dog had been diagnosed with liver disease and had very elevated enzymes. My vet told me about this product, and my dog has taken it now for almost 3 months.Through prayer, an interesting diet, Denosyl, and her will to live, she is doing much better!"
1,my vet does not recommend!,My mini-schnauzer has epileptic seizures and possible liver problems. I recently purchased this product for the benefits to help the liver process the phenobarb needed to control the seizures. I also work with a vet who told me she could not save a number of animals who came in after they had been on this product. Just want to make people aware of this so that you can make a better decision before purchasing. Ask your vet first and maybe get a second opinion as well.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Denosyl is a very good product.However, as it says on the package, it is sold ONLY through veterinarians.Just as other veterinary products (particularly flea treatments of various kinds), it can often be found in secondary NON veterinary outlets, such as Amazon. How is the product obtained? Is it the same product? Can you be sure it hasn't been tanmpered with or altered in any way? (yes, people do that- there's money in cheap veterinary secondary market products).The manufacturer WILL NOT guarantee the product if not purchased through a vet. The manufacturer WILL NOT cover expenses associated with bad reactions to the product if not purchased through a vet.The listed price here is what my distributor charges ME for the product. How can it cost in the retail market what it costs in the wholesale market?BUYER BEWARE people- you may just be getting what you're paying for.A vet."
4,Great help to our fur-baby,"Our 11 month old Chihuahua had an elevated liver enzime of 900 after an episode of vomiting and almost dying... The vet put her on this medication, and it was so expensive from the vet's office we were really excited to find it online for less.Our Fur-baby will have to be on this for the rest of her little life, so it's nice to know we can get it for a good price, since it will be a long term investment. Even on this, she is still going through good days and bad days, though while on this most days are good.Shipped fast from the seller and was delivered super quick as well."
4,Great Job!!!,"I am not into rap music of any kind, however, I think this man has a positive way to reach young people. Since this is the style of music they prefer, I am in favor of anything that will bring them to Christ. Keep up the great work, B-Wise."
1,Get what you pay for..,These bottles are made of very thin plastic. I can see light through them in places. The tops are not as sturdy as I'd like and there is NO place to write on them as the listing states. Not to mention the box came damaged and two of my four bottles were smushed. I'm very disappointed.
4,. . .,"Is anyone else a little bit bothered by the title phrase ""Finding Eternal Truth in Unlikely Music."" Stockman in obviously aware of the shallow, pat-your-own-back CCM machine, but what is the need for this title? Lauryn Hill's music an unlikely place to find truth? Hardly. While I understand Stockman's goal to make this ""Unlikely Music"" the standard-bearer for hopeful Christ-followers, why encourage this sort of language? It certainly doesn't help when trying to reccomend the book to those who have nothing to do with faithful discipleship. I'm guessing the publisher slapped this little subtitle on in order to make it more ""marketable,"" but I think it's more than a little self-defeating."
1,Anti-American political bias ruins an interesting premise,"The author takes a look at a baker's dozen of well known musicians and points out Christian elements in their works. In some cases this is more apparent than in others. However, it is much more apparent that the author has a politically liberal, anti-American axe to grind. Negative comments aimed at Republicans and anything related to them appear at unexpected and unnecessary moments. The putrid low point was contemplating the cause of 9/11 as being America's fault. Sadly, the author's take on an interesting premise is sandbagged by biased political commentary."
1,DON'T BUY! Color bleeds/changes in dishwasher,"Do yourself a favor and stick with Gerber spoons or another brand. These are NOT dishwasher safe!!!! I have used them for only a couple months (have a ten month-old who didn't start solids until 5 months). After just a month or so of use, the spoon color started to fade and bleed and change to a brownish yellow stain on each one. They are awful. I won't use them anymore because I'm worried about what could be getting into my baby's food. I highly recommend you avoid this item."
4,they work,"We got these spoons for our 6 month old. They work well and are a good size for his mouth. He likes to play with one while we feed him with the other, so the metal part is not always so great for playing. But, the plastic spoons are all more toddler-sized and too big for his little mouth. These work fine for now."
5,Perfect little spoon for starters,"I bought the spoons based on Amazon reviews and my daughter loves them, and also it's just perfect for her little mouth too."
4,A Cult Classic in the Making,"What the film lacks in ""esoteric film quality"" is compensated by the special interest content.If you like the Mad Max trilogy (Mad Max, Mad Max: The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome) and you like motorcycling, especially dual-sport motorcycling (on-road & off-road), then you will love this film.The motorcycle ridden by the main character in this film is a Kawasaki KLR650, which happens to be my favorite bike of all time. In the 2000 model buyer's guide in the March 2000 issue of the Motorcyclist magazine, the Kawasaki KLR650 is described as: ""When asked to choose just one motorcycle to live with for the rest of our lives, many of us pick Kawasaki's KLR650. This may be the most versatile motorcycle on the planet.""Actually when watching the movie, one has to wonder if Kawasaki was the sole sponsor."
2,Good Lookin' but HORRIBLE BELT CLIP,"I had to exchange this case three times because the belt clip kept breaking. As a matter of fact, it just broke again for the fourth time today. The case though is very good looking and protects your phone way better than the holster. The clip will break in like one month tops. You should wait until Samsung corrects this mistake, just like one of the previous reviews said. One more thing that Samsung might want to take into consideration is adding a space on the bottom of the case so that you can charge your phone while in the case. I had to take a knife and scissors and cut one out myself. All in all, it's a pretty sturdy case except for THAT DARN BELT CLIP!"
4,Finally! A book on Buddhism I can understand.,This rather confusing topic was presented in a light-hearted and personal manner I could understand and appreciate. I'm looking forward to reading his other books.
4,Stands the test of time,"Thought the book started slow, but it picked up nicely and I found it difficult to put it down after ~25% into it.Loved the way the author didn't info dump everything about his dystopian world on the reader...we are permitted to slowly digest the uniqueness of the world. Good characterization, nice dialogue though some of it felt a bit too tidy to me. Will definitely be purchasing more of the author's work."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I loved this book and flew through it in a day and a half because I couldn't put it down.If you like dystopian novels, this is definitely one for you. Though perhaps not as bleak as Orwell's 1984, it was similar in style. While some aspects may seem a bit unlikely, it was overall relatively plausible, which makes for a better read, in my opinion. The protagonist, Payne, is likeable and relatable.There were a decent amount of typing mistakes and misspellings, which was surprising for a popular book, but it didn't take away from the storyline. All in all, a great book, and one I'll recommend to others."
5,Truly wonderful book on Saint Therese.,"This book offers us not only Therese's own words, but a good insight from the author about Therese's life. We see more than what seems to have become the too sweet Saint. We are able to look at how much she had to suffer, and how much she relied only on God to take her beyond that suffering."
5,An inspiration for all ages!,The Story of a Love is exceptionally human and divinely inspiring. No plaster saints here. I would give a copy to every teenager. Here is a story of true love.
4,A good place to start.,"...I recently had the pleasure of seeing Miss Slean inconcert at a lcal university, and though she keptthe audience waiting for nearly two hours, the finalresult was well worth it. She gave the best small-venue performance I have ever seen. Slean is a goodcomposer, a vibrant vocalist with a potent anddistinctive voice, and a great pianist and performer.A clinging precocity in her work is all that preventsher from rising head and shoulders above the otherartists to whom she is most often compared.This little album's a good place to start, but thereare other Sarah Slean titles available that Amazonhas yet to offer. You'd be wise to seek them out."
4,Great EP,"Sarah Slean's self-titled EP is a great sampler of both her newer material, as well as old. Many loyal fans of her independent releases -- ""Universe"" and ""Blue Parade"" -- may shy away from the newer songs, claiming they are too ""pop"" and too different; but this EP gives us a clear indication that Slean is anything but pop, and that she is creative in every sense of the word. She is a songwriter -- she writes heart-felt melancholy, melodic material. Yet, she also shows us that she can write something that's fun and playful, such as ""Sweet Ones."" Along with Hawksley Workman as co-producer, this EP is a great sign of what's to come."
2,Not the best,"My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food. However, since Purina developed the smart-blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey. The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery. I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color. My dog really likes the older version much better. I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better."
1,Terrible quality,"These wrenches are junk for anyone that uses tools on a regular basis. I have an entire set both SAE and Metric, several of both have fallen apart!!!"
2,Don't do it!,"This product looked good online, but fell apart right after I received it. Be careful! I would go to a store and get a quality wrench instead..."
3,Took Too Long!!,"This product is just like what any other vendor would sell but my complaint is that it took forever to receive the products. Since I'm paying for shipping, I don't understand why it takes several weeks to receive the order since other similar orders only take about half that amount of time."
5,this man is sick,okwerdz is a beast...welcome bitches is worth the price of the album alone. the beats are insane...domingo and jake one killed it. if you dont buy this album he might look your name up in the phone book. come to your house and kill you.
2,"Neat design, poor assembly quality.","It's a better design than the Swisstech, because the handles hinge outward and won't twist when you try to use it, and the handle is not as slippery. The handles are also shaped like more useful pliers, with a concave profile and wide stance.Both handles are slightly crooked. When closed, it just looks like junk.It is hard as heck to open, but one of the smaller screwdrivers tends to flop open.I had one of these many years ago, when it was ""Sebertech"". The old one was not junk like this. ""IDL Tools"" apparently has low standards, which is too bad because they have a superior design.The competing SwissTech is of slightly higher quality, but it too was once better.If you want this as a gift for someone, the Swisstech looks much better. Or maybe you want to pay more for a Leatherman Squirt."
3,well designed hard to open,I do not think it was designed for old hands. Separate parts are hard to open even after lubrication. Pliers work well and it is quite easy to carry
1,Doesn't work with 40 GIG iPod!,"This unit does not work with the 40GB iPod at all. After a while of using it with totally brand new fresh batteries, it just freezes up the iPod and causes a scratching sound. I have checked some online forums and others with 40 GB iPods and the Belkin Battery Pak have this same problem.I have contacted Belkin with no response. I regret purchasing this unit totally. If you have a 40 GB iPod, take my advice and avoid this item unless they come out with some sort of fix."
4,Great for iPod Video,"I bought this backup battery for when I travel and want to watch movies on the airplane. It works great, 4 batteries allowed me to watch about 4 hours of video. It's nice because you can turn the battery backup on and not use any of your iPods battery. This allowed me to save my iPod battery for when I got off the plane to get a connecting flight or just walk around with it in my pocket. It's also nice for watching movies because you can use the battery backup as a stand as you watch movies and not have to hold the iPod for the duration of the movie. Definetly recommend, I would be cautious about the batteries that come with it, I read about them overheating the iPod?"
3,Could be better,"For the 30 bucks that I spent on it, I was minimally impressed. The very first road trip that I used it on, it died out in 3 hours.The batteries were fresh out of the pack as well.Another thing is that it will not work with the case I have on my iPod. It's one of those snug fit Incase brands. It fits just fine when I charge in my computer, however, it will not stay in with the battery pack on.My Recommendation:If you are going on a road trip, invest in the car charger."
3,Great for iPod - How about the iPhone,"I've been using this rather bulky power bolster for my iPod on long trips, and it works well. Leaving now for a trip with my iPhone, I'm wondering how this will work with that device. Anyone have any experience with that?"
2,evo2 iSkin does not work with the Belkin Battery,"In response to the kid's question, no, it doesn't fit the Battery Pack with the case. I bought this thing, and have never used it, and according to these reviews, I may not."
4,"Improves IPOD some, but not enough to make a huge difference","Lets face it: The IPOD battery just doesn't measure up. It is supposed to last for up to 8 hours of music, but hasn't survived past two hours before it dies. Thats why this Belkin external battery pack is so attractive. It's been on my wishlist for months, and when I finally got it, I was disappointed. Although it has increased my battery life over 6 hours more, it still is not as streamlined as the IPOD itself. It just adds some ""dead weight"" to it. This being said, it is NOT very portable. This Backup battery pack is great if you are stuck with long delays at an airport somewhere. However, if you are planning to use this on your morning jogs around the block, skip it.Overall, this Battery Backup is a helpful addition to the IPOD, but it's size and weight really are limiting factors."
3,Good but way to BIG!,I got one when I was in Canada because my ipod ran out of juice and there was no where to charge it up... Simply put ... its just 'TOO BIG' for practical and on-the-move use!... there is no way you can walk around with your ipod and the battery pack in your pocket... its stupid... it is good for flights but that's about it...Belkin have made a smart looking and high quality product but the size is just stupid in my opinion...but saying that I wouldn't need to carry around a bloody battery pack if Apple improved the ipod battery life.
3,iPod Battery Life Extender,"This is a great product to extend the battery life of the iPod. Very useful for International plane travel, long road trips, or any time you will not be able to recharge.If you have battery problems, i.e. it dies, forget apple support...check this out:http://www.ipodbattery.comandhttp://www.ipodsdirtysecret.com/Happy iPodding!"
2,Could be better,"Going on a long flight or not near an outlet. This is handy, for its price. There are other recharges out there, but they cost double or triple the cost. AA batteries are easy to come by, so that makes this a good product. But turning it on is a chore. You better have a key or nail file near by. Sliding the switch on is a struggle. And when you do not need it, turn it off, otherwise the batteries will drain. It also does not snug completely to the 30GB. If your iPod is low on batteries, this will work in a pinch. But if the connection comes loose and the iPod batteries are low, the iPod will turn off without any notice. Also, the suction cups are not needed. Most people keep their iPods in some sort of protective barrier (plastic or rubber). So the suction cups are a nuisance.If it snugged better and rested at the bottom (like the other rechargers) I would give it a 4, a 5 if it lasted longer."
3,Useful Product,"I bought the Belkin Battery Pack when I bought my 30G Video iPod. I travel frequently to Europe and Asia and wanted something that would power my iPod on the flight (10 hours to Germany, 20 to Korea), and used batteries I could find anywhere.I threw away the generic AA's that came in a package and use Energizers or Duracells. I've never had a lock up, or had the unit overheat. It powers my iPod for about 22 hours at reasonable volume levels.The only negative is that it doesn't accomodate my iPod in a hardshell case, so I've resorted to holding the whole thing together with a couple of rubber bands. Not pretty, but effective."
1,Needs Some Work!,The first one I bought started smoking. The second one I exchanged it for only lasted about 6~7 hours with a set of top of the line brand new disposable batteries. I ended up returning it for my money back and then i went out and picked up a 100+ hour per charge iPod lithium battery pack from batterygeek which is working out much better.
5,Perfect for long/overseas flights!,"I picked this up to use with my video iPod before a trip from the US to South Africa and it did exactly what I needed it for. As I was going to be on the plane for a long time, I didn't want to be without my music and movies on my beloved iPod. I popped a fresh set of AAs in before the trip and had some spares with me (but never needed them) and it worked perfectly.The key is to not use this as a charger. I just made sure I had it plugged into the iPod every time I used it on the plane. That way only the AAs were being used and my internal iPod battery never lost charge.If you are traveling overseas or doing long flights, this is a must have."
3,Big Backup,"Utility is good.Ease of use is good.Backup time is great.Size is inconvenient, it does not fit around many cases for the ipod, nor does it allow easy use while ipod is in a non-powered cradle.It does not charge the ipod battery."
4,Good Backup,"This isn't something you would want to carry in your pocket, but if you have a bag with you, it could be a big help. You can actually watch a couple movies with this attached. Without it, I can only get a little over one hour of video time."
4,A game not a book but lots of fun,"Don't be fooled, there isn't a story, but kids love the way that the book opens out into a 3D game. Colorful, great detail, cool thought 10 year old (pre-teens don't seem to notice its just a ghost variation on snakes and ladders). Simple rules means both 10 year old and 4 year old enjoy it, although the wobbly house (characters fall off their step when board is knocked) does lead to arguements. It can occupy them for half an hour plus though. Strongly recommended for any young readers who think books are boring."
4,"Really cool action figure, but easy to brake.","I LOVE REN AND STIMPY! This action figure is really well made and very detailed. If you're a fan, is a great purchase!! But, unfortunately, it brakes really easily. Both Ren and Stimpy's foot are broken and I didn't move that much. If they could fix this problem with durability it would be 5 stars!"
5,Dirty and dangerous,"Iain Sinclair knows the mythical paths of London like no-one else. In poetic often painfully intense prose, he conjures up the half-dead spirits that stalk the streets of this seedy town. The landscape is dominated by dodgy second-hand book dealers skulking in the shadows obsessed by the Ripper murders, and by the vicious presence of Jack himself, the embodiement of powerful evil forces embedded in the fabric of the city. If you only ever read one novel about Jack the Ripper, or never wanted to read one, White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings is a must. A warning though: it is not for the faint-hearted."
2,Totally cliched and blah,"This book was not worth what they are charging. It was predictable, story lines were not in depth, and the whole book was just flat. It sounded like it would be a good read but then just fell far short of my expectations. I read the other reviews praising the book and calling it charming - I guess it's charming, but not much more than that. There's no sizzle and no suspense. Sebastian is supposed to be a reformed rake, but he's so solicitous and considerate that he appears blah and boring. This is the first in a series, and I'll have to give the next books a pass."
2,Where were the book editors?!?,"I go into every book thinking I'll like it. Wish I could have liked this one a bit more.PROS I liked the characters, but didn't really find out too much about them; they needed a LOT more ""fleshing out."" The story itself had promise, but we are left to guess the why of so many actions of the characters.CONS Um, wow, where to begin ... example: they used ""mute point"" instead of ""moot point"" (way too many of those types of errors.) Heroine makes a reference to something being in her genetics ... ah, Mendel didn't come up with that theory until 50 years after the action in this story. And then the use of ""okay"" and other words that were definitely NOT in the English vernacular in 1808.Fine for a quick read if you're not fussy."
2,I didn't like it,"The book has so many recipes but unfortunately, they are not classic salad recipes. Some of vegetable salad recipes involve flowers, tongues, livers, fruits such as apples, grapes, etc. I thought they were too weird. I never eat flowers, tongues and livers nor do I put grapes or apples in my vegetable salads. It could be that I'm very old fashioned. I love classic salad recipes that you usually hear about or eat at the restaurants. Too bad, this book lacked in that area. Though, it does include 200 new/different recipes. If you want to try out new/different recipes, then you should buy this book but if you want a book filled with classic salad recipes, then I highly recommend ""Joy of Cooking: All About Salads & Dressings""."
4,"Cool, but...","This book is impressive, but lacks in some places. I would definately recommend it if you are a Salad Lover."
2,ok for VERY young children,"My boys are 3 and 5 yrs old. The older was thrilled with the movie about planets... it lasted for about 10 minutes. At the end of the program he was very upset and disapointed. While for his younger brother it was quite interesting, my serious future astronaut could not stand a baby rocket toy, singing planets etc. He has learned much more from the books than this dvd."
4,Give it a Chance,"Okay, this video is really cheesy. The first time I watched it I really didn't like it! But guess what, my 4yo is CRAZY about it and after the 4th or 5th time it really grows on you. The songs are catchy (though I hate to admit it, LOL) It's pretty basic, which is perfect for a child who doesn't know anything about the solar system - they focus on one key point for each planet, easy for them to remember. But even my son, who enjoys Discovery Channel space programs, did not find this boring. I think it's worth the $$. You might get sick of being asked to put it in all day long, though! LOL"
3,"okay, but could be better","My 4 year old enjoys this, and it does teach the order of the planets. However, there just isn't much information beyond that. I felt like there could have been a lot more information than what was provided. Anyway, this is a fun little video for a 3 or 4 year old but I think a child older than that would probably be bored with it.My #1 complaint, though, is that the little boy who is the main character is so whiny- at times it's like fingernails on a blackboard.Oh, and the information is out-of-date since this was produced before Pluto was taken off the list of planets."
2,Not worth the money!,"I bought this for my two year old after reading all of the reviews. Have you all watched this? Within the first 5 minutes the planets are calling each other 'fart face' and 'stinky'! Didn't expect that. This is a low-budget waste of money....my son is so obsessed with space and I was excited to show this to him, that now that I really don't want him to, I have to find a substitute. Maybe this is ok for older children, but not if you don't want your two year old to start using negative terms."
5,Catchy Songs Are A Hit With My Daughter,"My daughter, age six, loves to sing. Lately, all she sings is the soundtrack to this DVD. She even has me singing along. It's nice that she really knows her planets now. Very good way to entertain and teach at the same time."
5,A Wonderful Introduction To The Planets!,"My daughter Brianna is three years old. She loves music so much that I decided to get her this musical about the planets. The songs are so great that my daughter will sing along and never grow tired of the story either. She has watched it at least twenty times now. She knows all the planets and likes to act out scenes from the movie, like asking me to blow (like the Cold Planets) on her pretend rocket ship to cool it down (a scene from the movie). She especially likes the rap song of all the planets and dances around the house performing it. I am so happy that she loves this DVD and that she now knows the planets. :)"
5,Definitely a Fantastic Field Trip!,"I was hesitant to buy this thinking that the DVD was some school field trip video, but luckily I listened to my son and took this one home. This fantasy adventure is truly edutainment at its best. My son will sit for hours watching Nemo and other Disney fare and never learn a thing. He loves to watch this planets DVD and now knows all the planets and several distinguishing features about each planet. The songs have lyrics conducive to long term fact retention as evidenced by my child's newfound knowledge of the planets.Kudos to the producers of this excellent program. Now, if only the networks would make programming with a purpose."
2,Watch before you show your children,"I eagerly bought this video after having borrowed it from the library a million times.I was especially pleased that this video had been updated to include the ""demotion"" of Pluto. However, that is not the only edit. In addition, the planets call each other names that are not fit for small ears. IE, ""fartball"". Therefore, a perfectly good video is now worthless. The edits are unnecessary and disappointing. I plan to contact the company and tell them the same."
3,Not for children,"While this is a great volume, I wish there would have been some information to let me know rhat this book is not for children. It is a book written for the more mature reader. Based on the text size, absence of pictures and use of language, it is suitable for the young adult to adult reader. It is not suitable for anyone under 15 yeard old. Not even for a read aloud."
1,Junk,"Does not work. Vendor sent me a cable, I used it, it didn't work, they sent me a replacement, replacement didn't work. Case closed."
3,cute book,i have never read this book and it wasnt much inspiration for my kiddos. Its nice thats its a cardboard book. good for keeping in the washroom for the kiddos to read while doing their business.
1,Lousy potty learning and parenting examples,"I have not read any other books in this series, so maybe there is something endearing about George and Ba that I'm missing, but I'm hard pressed to imagine what.I don't know which part I liked less... the forcing the kid to sit on the potty even though he said he didn't have to go (and he was right...he didn't go!). Or maybe it was the over-authoritarian BIG VOICE with which George ordered him to the potty. Or maybe it was the rewarding of the eventual pottying with a hug (the only apparent display of love or support in the book).The running for the potty when he realized he finally had to go was cute, but doesn't make up for the rest of the book. Leave this on the ""shelf,"" so to speak -- for a GREAT book on Potty Learning, check outTime to Pee!"
1,On your potty,"I didn't like this book it really didn't have any useful information in it but to my 2.5 year old, it was funny!"
3,Day Tripper flubs are back again,"I just figured I would let anyone who cares know that although this new 2011 remastered release of 1 does still sound great, it uses the remasters made for the 2009 album reissues which are more or less just crisp, cleaned up versions of the original recordings without much revisionist alterations and the like, and as such the fixes that were applied to Day Tripper on the 2000 release to hide flaws in the original recording are no longer present and the song is presented as it originally was. I'm not sure if any other songs are affected by this but I definitely noticed that one."
4,great cd,Love listening to those Beatles tunes. I play this a lot. I'll look for more Beatles CD's in the future.
3,It's ok,The record or disk is good but the beatles have best hit disks that are better. save your money and get the songs you want.
5,How can you go wrong?,"Of course, I love rarities, but this work demonstrates the evolution and versatility of The Beatles' music. Perhaps we don't let today's artists grow as earlier generations did, which is a shame. Just listen to how The Beatles sound and message changed with the times and personal maturity...would we allow current artists to do the same? It's worth listening to in order to hear the value in pop, in ""light"" and in (at least for the 60s and 70s) alternative. Craft is key: that partnership among songwriting, production and talent. Listening to the early songs makes me look for the art in today's pop songs - and it is there. The genuine anger and angst of some of the later work makes many of today's overwrought, emo, woe-is-me fabrications look positively foolish. This record is both textbook and work of fiction - follow the textbook as a guide and be inspired by the novel."
4,For most of his life Ben Franklin was a loyal British,"subject. He also spent more time in England than any of the ""founding fathers"". This is a biography but also the history of how the British lost America thru their own stupidity. Franklin had a logical & forward thinking mind. He knew that America would not be a colony forever. That America could be ruled for much longer by a small island accross the the ocean was not reasonable. But that would happen long after he was dead. His coming of age politically was The Albany Plan of Union in 1754 which dicusses such proposals as uniting the various states & a constitution. This was all in the context of remaining in the British Empire. This book is his story of disaffection & final break with the mother country. Truly America's first world wide celbrity."
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well written? Yes. Character development? Oh yes, way too much. In fact that is the entirity of this book. Plot? Yes there is a plot but it is background for hundreds of pages of character development. This book is 400 plus pages long, at page 250 the only thing that had happened was a rescue of a racing ship, and a boring rescue at that. Had I not mistakenly ordered the second book in this series I would not have finished this book at all. Its just slow, it has the makings of a good plot and a good book but all that happens in this book could've been condensed into 50 pages."
2,Just okay...,"I found this book to very boring. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read but it's far from the best. I regret wasting money on this purchase. If your looking for a well written, interesting sci-fi book I recommend ""Old Man's War"" by John Scalzi. I am extremly suprised that this book has such a high rating."
1,Dread Empire's social calendar/formal ball/soap opera.,"I have read both Hardwired and Voice of the Whirlwind by the same author (and enjoyed both), but am at a loss with what to do with this book at page 130. I want to like it, but I cannot seem to get past endless balls/dinners/social scheming. The author spends pages on stuff that has nothing at all to do with science fiction, and everything to do with a human soap opera. The underlying setting and plot may occupy 10% of the book to this point.Tell me it gets better, please (or tell me the whole series is like this). Is this what readers of the later novels of the Wheel of Time series complained about?"
2,Predictable Four Corners,"Ok, other than the one identity twist anyone with a brain picks up on after 75 pages or so, this book will bore you to death... it could easily have been written in 1940 (although it pales to the Masters of that time, Heinlein/Asimov/etc.).Not a single character took any action/inaction which surprised me in the entire book. It's like they all had tunnel vision.And humor is (nearly) entirely absent.I would have somewhat enjoyed the basic ""war story"" premise up to age 14 or so. So that age group -- ignore this review, your homones will compel you to enjoy any man vs. bug fightin' story.I did finish the book (barely), but won't be reading the sequel."
2,Dragged on and on,"The back cover description of this book was very misleading. Unless you're a big fan of reading about upper class bloodlines, formal balls, and the like, this book is likely to put you to sleep. I was patient... I waded through many pages, waiting for the intergalactic battle to start. The characterization is strong, I'll give it that; a couple of the characters are rich and interesting. But not only was the Shaa society stiff and overly formal, the plot was too. Save your money. This one's a snore."
5,Redefining Space Opera,"The Praxis is an extraordinary work by one of science fiction's most talented writers. Williams has created a complex society and populated it with fascinating characters. The battles don't pretend to be fighter planes in space, but take into account the vast distances, and thus add to the tension. I'm eagerly awaiting the futher adventures of Martinez and Sula."
2,unoriginal,"Many other reviewers have covered the same ground here: the point-of-view characters are vivid and engaging, but the storytelling proceeds at a glacial pace. (I lost patience and stopped reading around page 150.)What I haven't seen addressed directly is the complete lack of originality. I kept waiting for a spark of something new, and it never came."
4,Hornblower in space - part 1,"The success of the Honor Harrington series has attracted another, better writer to this niche. Walter Jon Williams is a terrific writer. The development of the characters is excellent. These are people with flaws and greatness on display. Minor characters are well drawn, at least human ones.My only gripe is that, like the Honor-verse of David Weber, this series only aspires to be Horatio Hornblower in outer space. I are still waiting for Aubrey-Maturin in outer space!"
5,EXCITING -MINE BOGGLING - GREAT DIALOUGE,"THE BOOK KEPT MY INTREST THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH,THE CHARACTERS AND PLACES REALY STOOD OUT IN THIS BOOK, AND READING THIS MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS THERE,I REALLY GOT INTO THIS MYSTERY AND LOOK FORWARD TO READING MORE OF THIS TYPE OF MYSTERIES THAT HOLD U IN SUSPENCE LIKE THIE THIS BOOK HAS DONE ,"
1,Elvis lives.,"I thrilled that the REAL truth about Dilbert has finally been exposed. I also belong to the Flat Earth Society, saw Elvis at the Kmart last week, and have been abducted by aliens over 800 times."
2,I think Solomon's taking Dilbert a little too seriously ...,"Thank you, Solomon, for providing a Freudian Ego complex for what Scott Adams is ""really"" saying.Did Garfield have to deal with this criticism 15 years ago (I mean really -- do all cats really like lasanga)?I don't object Solomon writing this book. I'm just very sad he missed a golden opportunity to fight fire with fire ... why not create a cartoon character who ""chose"" to write this book, criticizing Dilbert for his work habits? I kept reading this book because I could imagine a caricature of Solomon steaming in my face these laments ... and THAT was very entertaining !!"
4,Disturbing critique of a cultural phenomenon,"As a fan of Dilbert, I found this book disturbing. Solomon skillfully points out that Dilbert is popular with both workers and managers. Dilbert, in fact, is an ""approved"" channel for workers' frustrations in an increasingly dehumanized workplace. Rather than addressing the real and serious problems that workers face in an age of downsizing, mergers, automation, falling real wages, etc., and pointing toward just solutions, Dilbert blames the problems of the workplace on the stupidity of other workers(never the reader's) and the ineptitude of management. Solomon points out that Scott Adams, far from being a rebel, is an ultra-capitalist, far more in tune with top corporate decision-makers than with the rank and file. For those, like myself, who (used to) look on Dilbert as the champion of the underdog, this book has been a revelation."
1,The Jealousy Of Norman Solomon,"Tsk, tsk, tsk. In this reader's opinion Norman Solomon's jealousy of Scott Adams' success is showing. He takes comments made by Adams out of context. He is just riding the Dilbert creator's 'coat tails'."
1,It Stinks!!!,"This guy is taking this WAY too seriously. It's a comic, for crying out loud! He also ignores the fact that not only does he make fun of Dilbert, but Scott Adams also makes fun of management, about 5x as hard. Why else would he go into Dilbert's cubicle and look around and then say, oblivious to what is really happening, and then say ""Try identifing the problem and then solving it."" He doesn't look at the fact that he critisizes downsizing; he doesn't promote it. Scott Adams get his material from the experience he has when he, too, worked in a cubicle. This guy doesn't know what he is talking about. Avoid this book, lighten up, and go read the funnies. You'll be glad you did. END"
1,Scott Adams has the ability to highlight corporate flaws,"Scott Adams has the uncanny ability to highlight corporate flaws accurately and amusingly, though not necessarily in that order. He is at his best when using humor to laugh at the managers and employees in large organizations.Yet he has his critics. The loudest criticism comes from a self-confessed enemy of management, Norman Solomon, who discovered, belatedly, that Adams is not a fellow traveler.Adams has been such so successful criticizing managers, that many are shocked to find him in favor of efficiency.Large organizations create work for themselves, and people working in them know this. This has always been a Dilbert theme, along with the idea that whole departments could disappear, and not be noticed by the end customer.Adams was criticized for greed, cynicism and hypocrisy. In his words ""this hurt because in my heart I know I am only greedy and cynical."""
2,Dilbert is fine,"Norman obivously hasn't read enough dilbert strips to understand the true meaning of the strips. He got a quotehe could turn into a bad thing, and then wrote a book around it. Dilbert is funny. Whydaya HAVE to knock it?Good concluding chapter though."
3,The Stories Had To Be Told,Very upsetting book on real life. I'm glad Donna works so hard in the field and effort to stop domestic violence.
5,Beautiful nose ring,This is a beautiful nose stud. It's big enough to actually see it but small enough to still be feminine. It's caused no irritation like another 14k nose stud I have that I paid much more for. It fits in so perfectly I can't even feel it. Definitely worth every cent we paid for it.
3,A typical torn from the headlines crime book,"As the ""True Crime Editors"" said, the only thing this un-remarkable book really does, is clear up misconceptions about the defendants themselves which the media had spread. However, the author is not capable of weaving together a narrative which compels the reading and which has any, whatsoever, literary merit. The prose is completely matter-of-fact, and not that you would expect a novel, but with such interesting material, such compelling themes and such a sinister plot you would think the author could have done a better job. He tries to introduce information and interviews with friends of the defendants, and their lawyers, but you can tell the author doesn't know how to do this with subtlety. In short, an unremarkable book which may gave you some facts about the Diane Zamora, and David Graham case."
1,This book is not very accurate,"I only read part of this book before putting it down, because there were so many false statements and inaccuracies. For example, it states that Graham's mother was twenty years younger than his father. Not true. She is 11 years younger. Also that the murder weapon, a 9mm handgun, was Graham's father's. Also not true. David bought the murder weapon from a classmate in the parking lot at Mansfield high. (for $75.)I happen to be very close to Mr. Graham and he himself has expressed that he wished he could sue the author of this book because of its many inaccuracies.The other book written about this crime is accurate. This one is not.(Also, for what it's worth, the lifetime movie is accurate, according to David Graham.)Do not waste your time with this book if you want to get to the truth of what happened."
3,I went to School with Diane Zamora,I just have to say killing someone has done good for her looks because she finally got to put make up on and some decent clothes. What I don't understand is where they get off saying she was slightly intelligent. From what I remember she didn't excel at anything she did. Must have gotten her grades mixed up with someone else.
5,Perfect!,"Le Creuset is known for incredible quality and durability. I really love this buffet, and plan to purchase a larger size (or two) as well. This one if perfect for ""side"" dishes!!"
5,Pretty and useful for lots of recipes,"I've had mine for a while now, and it's great for on top of the stove and then into the oven recipes, like pork chops. I haven't tried it yet for a paella, but it would be lovely for that as well. It weighs a ton, so be forewarned. I love all my Le Creuset cookware and I am so proud when I use it, I really love it!"
5,Does the Job...Charge!,"This kit connects easily to the bottom of the iPod, and does what it advertises. The cord is long enough that people in the backseat can manipulate it without pulling it out of the lighter socket. If that much cord is not needed, there is a Velcro strap that can be used to keep the excess coiled up.When it's charging the iPod, there is a green light that shines through the plastic at the end of the adapter that plugs into the lighter socket. It makes it very easy to tell if the connection is made successfully.Also, the whole device has a very small footprint in terms of the amount of space that it takes up when putting it into a bag with the iPod."
3,"Works well, but not made to last","It works great and I like that I can plug right into it, but after a couple years of using it, the cable has started to come out of the casing because of the awkward side mounting of it. It seems like a good idea to have it coming out of the side like that, but maybe they just didn't connect it very well, because I've just been waiting for it to break because from the beginning it felt kind of like it was ready to give.I'm gonna go with the Monster Cable Ultra-Low Profile iPod iCharger this time. The reviewers say you can plug right into the charger just like this one, and I trust Monster, so we'll see how this round goes!"
2,Not a good fit for my BMW 325iX,"I've have two bad things and one good thing to say about this product:1) The plug is not a tight fit in my car's cigarette lighter (BMW 325iX) ... as such my iPod turns off everytime the adapter is bumped, which is very annoying.2) There is a high-pitched whining noise when I accelerate ... I've read that I can fix this by purchasing some additional parts, but please I shouldn't have to do that.3) The volume control / line out is a very nice feature ... without it the signal from the headphone jack is too weak and makes switching between my iPod and the radio dangerous (i.e. too loud), however with it the volumes are more similar ... nice.So overall I'm in the process of debating if I can deal with the bad in order to have the good. Bottom-line is that there is room in this market for a better product, but for now ... ?"
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I purchased this unit to find better sound quality and continue to charge my i-pod while I drive to work. This item DID NOT WORK. I tried both cigarette lighters with no success. The little red ""on light"" worked but nothing else. Rather than going to the trouble of returning it I just continued to use my old charger."
2,Build quality sucks,This product works pretty good...........when it's not broken. The wiring came apart on the first one I owned. Belkin has a lifetime warranty so I returned it for another one that now won't stay connected to the cigarette lighter and I see no way of fixing it. Now one of the buttons that helps you remove the iPod from the adapter has broken on the third one I've owned. At least I can get it replaced for around $5 from Belkin with return shipping.
2,Analog audio-output?,"I just bought this item because I need something to charge my ipod and I like the fact that it has the audio output jack so I plug my ipod into my car stereo Aux jack. I must said I'm very disappointed due to loud popping noise this thing generate even though I have the volume at minimum and not even plug in my ipod yet. I'm going to return it. I bought this before reading any review, I just noticed Amazon description said ""The auto kit also provides an adjustable amplifier and .125-inch analog audio-output"", can any one verify the output is actually in stereo?"
2,"Great idea, but flimsy.","After a month of usage, the protective insulator came loose from where the cable enters the Ipod Dock connector, exposing bare cable. Three days later, the built-in amplifier blew out. It's a great idea, but I at least got a serious lemon."
4,The One to Get!,Review the rest and buy the best. This is a must have for the car. All FM transmitters work better...including the iTrip. Belkin just knows how to build great products. My favorite feature: it pauses the iPod for you when you shut off the car.Don't take a road trip without it.
1,Does not work in my car,"Short of a full iPod integration kit which is $$$ and it's not quite there yet, technically, (at least for my car) I thought this device would work well. In my Mazda3 arm-rest box, there is a 12V outlet and an Aux input! regretably, the electrical humm from this device makes it unusable."
3,I think I got one with a bad connection,I had this set up before and loved it. Mine was stolen so I bought the same thngs. This set seems to short out and I have to jiggle it a lot to get it to give me full sound. It is times like these that I wish I'd bought it from a store where I can just go in and exchange it. Dealing with return postage etc makes it just too much trouble.
5,Love this little charger with extra features,"I recently got this item to use with my Ipod mini and now for my 80gb Ipod. I have been using a tape deck adaptor, so the fact that I could plug that into this charger was a major purchasing factor for me. I am able to reach everything just fine while plugged in, the sound is good and it is much neater than say a cell phone charger. Mostly I am just glad to be able to complete a trip without my Ipod running out of juice."
1,Adds noise to iPod's sound,"Despite the iPodish design, this car connector adds noise to the sound. I connected the iPod to a cassette adapter through the iPod's headset connector. Even with the egine stopped, you will hear a shhhhhh sound over the original sound. I now either charge the iPod, or listen to it in the car. I don't know if other chargers do the same, but I am dissapointed with the performance of this product."
4,ATTENTION: TO MAKE IT LAST MUCH MUCH LONGER...,"By using this in your car, you may be moving it, twisting it, setting it here and there and ultimately really giving it some wear and tear... specifically the cable itself. The greatest point of weakness is where the wire goes into the plastic piece that clicks into your iPod. This item works great, but upon first purchasing and receiving it, place a few drops of superglue on the wire right where it leaves the plastic plug for the iPod. Otherwise your wire could/will fray and short out."
2,Just okay,Belkin F8V7058-APL. There is static with any movement of the connected iPod and an annoying electrical hum with the device volume control at certain levels. I don't know if it's broken or supposed to be this way. I'm too lazy to send it back and it's just acceptable for use.
3,Not my fav,"After getting Trophy Hunter 2003, I snatched up Deer Hunter 2004 when I saw it. Well, it's a bore. I love the horse riding, being a rider for real, but I'm also a deer hunter and a previous review is correct; the deer behave oddly. They either run over you or are not responsive to calls. I've lain on that huge rock between the fields and had 3 spike bucks circle continually right on top of me. In 3rd person camera, it's a hoot watching your character get tromped on. The Texas-type map is really dull, and the midwestern farm stuff leaves you pretty much just sitting there. Save your time, get the Trophy Hunter 2003 or later. That's by the same company, same $'s go to them, and it's a genuinely great game. Waiting to see if this company picks up the pace on their Deer Hunter game, next issue, since a good deer-only game is needed but it needs the quality of the Trophy Hunter series."
2,Very Disappointed!!!,I had really hoped this would have been better... a patch is needed very badly to correct many of the tech problems. Although there are some very nice features that have been added I found the game to be boring and very uneventful. I don't want it easy but I sure don't want to walk the map for 3 hours before I see something other than a fish floating across the land!!! LOL I think their loyal customers would have been better served had they put the new technologies into Trophy Hunter 2004 instead.
1,Crazy price hike,"Great deal at about $11. I bought a bag and subscribed for scheduled delivery. Then a couple of weeks later, the price jumps to $17.92, well over the cost locally.Canceled any future deliveries. Nice dog food, crazy way to do business, Amazon."
2,Not happy at all.....,Two stars is kind. I am not sure what is going on here as I have been using this dog food for some time now.... but the bag I just opened (from Amazon) is not the same as the last ten bag of this stuff. First off it is a different color??? and second the soft bits are hardly in this bag. The soft bits that are in the bag are hard and crumble in my hand. Now this may not be Amazon fault.... it could have been store wrong... or Purina has change the blend. Either way I am not happy nor is my dog. I will be calling Purina first thing tomorrow morning and ask for my money back and then buy a local bag and see what is what. So right now buyer beware.10/04/2012 Just an update .... called Purina and the are sending me a coupon for a free bag and an additional discount coupon for my trouble .... but it will take 7 to ten days. My wife went to walmart today to get a new bag so my dog will eat again ;-)
3,Riding through the Desert....,"I have to admit, this band is a little odd...why would ride through a desert on a horse with no name? At any rate, it's a great CD because you can sit and ponder all of their very harmonic lyrics and quiet guitar parts. Not the hard rock also produced in the 70's, America has captured that almost folk sound to some of their songs between the hamonizing vocals and the stories they weave into their songs."
2,Good in the beginning and then it headed down.,"The problem with America was that started out great. The first album was fresh and different from everything. Three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own. ""Horse with no name"" and ""SandMan"", was what pave the way for them. The problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop. They should of left ""Muskrat Love."" to the Captain and Tennille.This album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end. The problem was that there was their first two albums, ( America and Venture Highway) and there was their others.My recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans."
1,One reason the 70's have such a reputation for lame music,"America is one of the reasons the 1970's have such a reputation for lame music. It isn't just the dopey gimmick the group had for having the titles of their albums all begin with the letter 'H' (a practice thankfully abandoned at some point) but just the whole ""we're so laid back and cool"" persona they tried to project.Although imitation is supposedly the greatest form of flattery, Neil Young said it best when he said of the song ""A Horse With No Name"" ""that's the song about the guy who THINKS he's done acid.""To be fair, not every song here is a total dud. ""Lonely People"" is a pleasant relic from a simpler time, and even the most die hard rockers will confess that ""Sister Golden Hair"" is catchy enough to qualify as a guilty pleasure. But this does not excuse such dreadful cuts like ""Tin Man,"" ""Woman Tonight,"" and a candidate for worst song ever written ""Muskrat Love.""All and all, leave this one back in the 70's where it belongs."
2,Derivative and uncompelling,"America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums."
1,Music that makes me want to put my head through a brick wall,"There are lists of Desert Island Discs, and there are lists that have this godawful album on this. I had a college roommate that played this garbage far too often, and I found myself welcoming death after a certain point. Horse With No Name? Muskrat Love? Are you kidding me? Does it truly get any worse than this? What lunatic considers these songs noteworthy other than for their sheer awfulness?"
3,VINYL REMASTER,"""History"" is a brilliant collection of tunes, remixed for the compilation by the great George Martin, and a favorite for those who love well made music. I was psyched to find this on new vinyl simply because my original disc was showing signs of wear. Unfortunately the remastered version sounds much more digital, hard and steely taking away from the organic bronze warmth of the former. Moreover, the compression applied brings up the instrumentation level cluttering the mix and at the same time weakens the vocals. The new vinyl sounds super clear and the remix punchy and dynamic but I'll continue playing my old copy. Also, this does not come with the original sleeve that contained liner notes and lyrics, a definite minus."
5,America's good stuff,"Only in America. They rode in on the wave of The Eagles, John Denver, Anne Murray, and Gordon Lightfoot. There was no such thing as ""light rock"" when these great tunes were created. The music of America was very much a part of the sound of the 70's.A special friend to Dewey was Phil Hartman. Back then Phil was a graphic artist who spread his creativity on the canvas of an LP. That's right... Phil was one outstanding pen and ink guy who created the artwork on THIS album!Isn't it funny how the most gifted of artists tend to resonate that way... bringing their own creative flavor to the music that motivated a generation. Enjoy America's Greatest Hits - History... Maybe you may be motivated to do something great, too!"
3,to much bass,i bought the vinal version of this album. i like my bass and good stereo sound this is why i buy vinal and listen to it on my 80s stereo with a 20 band equliser hooked up to a lap top with a good sound card. it has been remasterd ok but when you listen to a record produced by a known producer [bob clearmountain robert lang] the quality of the sound of this album is a let down for a remasterd recording.i have orderd bat out hell [remasterd] i will give this producer one more go. i have my original album from when bat out of hell came out to compair it to. epic lable can over treble there recordings as the original recording of bat out of hell was. i am 53 years old and live in australia . best sounding record [moving pictures DAYS OF INNOCENCE]on vinal.
4,Good But.....,"The music is well chosen and fan's of America will like this cd.My only problem is with the sound. I have to move my speakers 2 ft or so from the rear wall in order to enjoy this disc because the bass is very heavy. I have analyzed this recording with audio software and have found massive bass peaks in the actual recording itself. My speakers are normally placed 1 ft from the rear wall, but this disc has so much bass on some of the tracks like ""Ventura Highway"" I can't listen to it unless I cut the bass. This cd may have been reissued in different versions, so your disc may be different, but this is my experience with this album."
4,American Gold...,"I love the song 'Horse with no Name', don't ask me what it's about, just a catchy tune. America always had the song with the catchy tunes and here you can get all of them in one album. No need to buy any other America collection, their history album tells it all."
3,simple songs,"I would have rated this lower but I have to admit a certain fondness for anything that features talented musicians playing likable but simplistic songs. ""Alligator lizards in the air"" ? ""Sorry boy but I've been hit by purple rain"" ? Is that where Prince got the idea ?"
5,One of the greatest albums ever,"There's no better music with which to cruise down Ventura Highway (Pacific Coast Highway or the Long Island Expressway) in the sunshine! This album contains some of the best music written in decades - Most of the music is great ""feel good"" California pop (Ventura Highway, Sister Golden Hair) and other tunes (Tin Man, Lonely People) will make you nostalgic for those late 70's days - if you're old enough to remember them."
4,Harmonious,"A good collection of this soft rock band's hits. Could have added a few more songs (from Hearts, Today's The Day, Amber Cascades, California Dreaming) but is acceptable. This is another band whose catalog is grossly neglected by their record company, especially as their best music remains out of print (Hearts, Hideaway, etc.) Warners need to get on the stick sometime and rerelease those albums onto CD."
3,This is the definition of 70's soft rock-Good and Bad,"America, with its penchant for harmony, gentle guitar strumming and catchy melodies, were definitely the epitome of MOR. Sure, some of their songs were indecipherable in meaning(""Horse with No Name,"" ""Sandman"") but they always had a hook and a ""sing along"" quality. Even when they were sappy like on ""I Need You,"" they did it with class. There are some true standouts, like the country rock of ""Sister Golden Hair,"" or the soaring ""Ventura Highway,"" but the truth is if you buy this one you're looking for a little nostalgia for one of the 70's biggest hitmakers, music that won't change your life but will make it easy to hum along.PS. However, nothing can possibly forgive bringing ""Muskrat Love"" to the ears of any poor unprepared listener..."
5,Long live the 70's,"This is a great CD! I find myself playing it over and over. ""Horse With No Name"" is one of the greatest pop songs ever recorded and there are other tasty selections here too...""Lonely People"", ""Don't Cross The River"" and ""Sister Golden Hair"". I own all of there 70's stuff on CD and it's great music especially when you listen to what is being written and recorded these days. Pure junk! Long live the 70's and America."
5,Great Group! Great Songs!,I just saw America in concert (05-99). They played most of these songs. It was fantastic! I couldn't sit down!!
5,"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous","One of those albums you can listen to for hours. ""Daisy Jane"" is perhaps one of the most expressive and simply beautiful pop songs I've ever heard. Throw in ""Ventura Highway"", which always gets you smiling (I think it's the image of chewin' on a piece of grass, walkin' down the road, nothin' to do). And of course, the incomparable ""Sister Golden Hair"" with its universal plea of compromise (""will you meet me in the middle""...). Get this one, and put the CD player on shuffle. And sit back and enjoy."
2,It was okay for someone who cooks big meals,I got this book and it was okay but it really is for someone who cooks big meals or has a rather large family . Other than that I had heard of some of these recipes before . I also gave it as a gift to someone rather than seeing it sit on my shelf .
2,Advertisements Misleading,"I bought the Church Supper Cookbook after seeing the ad that came in the mail with beautiful looking pictures. I also tried the Barbara's Peachy Chicken & it was delicious! However, once I received the book, I found out that there are absolutely NO pictures in the book at all. With all the pictures in the ad, it led me to believe there would be pictures in the book.I must admit that I am one of those non-professional every-day cooks that wants to see how it looks before I attempt to try it. So I was very disappointed."
4,Simple Home Cooking,This book is well worth the cost. I have tried several recipes and have found all are easy to prepare and the book gives great instructions. Most of the recipes are from northern states but easily fit into any regional church dinner. When I serve recipes from this book to guests at my home I always get compliments and requests for copies of the recipes. Makes a great addition to any cookbook collection.
2,Disappointing,"The subtitle is very misleading.Having lived in New England, I love it as much as anyone, but to say the recipes come from across the country is a misrepresentation. Ninety-five percent of the recipes are from NH,CT,and NY. There are a couple from CA and one from another state, but that is it. The recipes are fine, but certainly not what I expected."
4,LOD Rules!,"Of all the Yu-Gi-Oh expansions out there, LOD is definitely for the die-hard Yu-Gi-Oh fan. If you love dragons like I do and want to build a good deck full of Dragon cards, LOD is definitely for you. In the first LOD pack that I got, I got the Dragon's Rage Trap card which will let any one of your dragons on the field take your opponent's life points away no matter what position their monster is in as long as your opponent's monster has a lower atk/def point value. I also got Grey Wing, which is a 1300 attack monster that will let you attack with it two times just by discarding 1 measly card from your hand! Trust me, If you love dragons, You definitely have to get some of LOD!"
5,The Bible amongst astrology litterature.,"This book is the source for most astrology - the ancients as well as the moderns students - who have respect for the art. Claudius Ptolemy was born in Egypt and lived in the years 100-178 (ref. Tetrabiblos)and left the scripts which is presented here in the four books ""Tetra Biblos"".It is from this scripts astrologers through the times has found the descriptions of the strength of dignities and debillities of the planets, the methodes of making predictions, subdivisions of the science of nativities, bodily descriptions etc."
1,poor,"Box and stuff is good, but the wheel have no force feed back,and have the broken sound when I turn the wheel(like a small object is inside the wheel)I need return this to AMAZON.comI got this today in 5:00pm, and it never works good."
3,Pleased,"I had remembered the series from the Sci-Fi channel some years ago.For someone who enjoys an adventure and a little of the ""King Arthur"" era senarios, it is an interesting and enjoyable view."
3,Good Series but short lived.,Started out as a excellent series. However they did not plan too well for a longer tenure.
5,A true celtic story for all ages,I found this series to be a great series for all ages. I found this shows life back in the ancient times in a way that can also be seen in todays time. Heath Ledger makes a great leader and shows the angst of leadership and the good and bad times it follows. This shows life in a fun and realistic way.
5,Roar the Series,I loved this when it aired. I love it now. Fun escapist TV. Of course plenty of eye candy for everyone. Happy to add to my Heath Ledger collection.
4,"""Roar"" provides interesting blend of historical fiction and fantasy","Although this series was short lived it was an interesting look at Celtic life, admittedly a bit fantasized, during the late Roman occupation of Britain. This is one of the earliest star turns for a very young Heath Ledger and he brings energy and intensity to the role of the youthful warrior. The immortal villain, Longinus, is interesting as well, although his presence is not fully explained. I would have preferred a more objective portrayal of the Romans rather than painting them as the evil counterparts to the ""good guy Celts"" but I overall I found the series an interesting departure from mob stories and sitcoms that now flood the airwaves."
5,Worth it!,"Heath Ledger is so good at accents! If you thought his western accent was good in Brokeback Mountain, listen to his celtic accent in Roar. He is my favorite Aussie. The series is reminescient of Xena and Hercules, but with a more continuing storyline throughout the series. I first saw this airing as re-runs on the Sci-fi network, but learned it was orignally aired in 1997. They did not release this on DVD until late 2006; there were a few online petitions begging for it's release. I enjoyed this show, especially the fact that the fight scenes were not overdone, although sometimes a little hard to believe."
5,Fantastic!!,Absolutely love it! Brings us to a time and place that isn`t looked at very much. Great acting by all the lead actors and actresses.
5,One of best tv shows I have seen,"I watched this when it was on the air years ago. It was great, innovative and moving. Was so disappointed when it suddenly disappeared. Can't wait to enjoy it again and share with what I'm sure will be many new fans."
4,Engrossing .....,I made it a point to set aside the weekly hour for this series when it aired on television and continued to watch its re-runs. Roar is a highly entertaining little series complete with moments of humor to compensate for its highly intense subject line.I bought this DVD series only months ago since it was available and sat through the entire series in a day or two (or one long day and an overnight? <g>) before passing it along for my brother-in-law to enjoy. I hadn't recalled the series as being so *intense* and downright disturbing at times. My most recent viewing of the entire series was a real eye opener ... and heart pounder! Maybe one needs to pass the age of 40 to recognize the depths this story actually imparts ...Highly recommended for young and old alike! :-)
5,ROARING AWESOME!!!!,"16 Episodes, 5 that have never aired on tv,Heath Ledger has done some movies, but none of them come close to this one.All I'm saying is if you like Heath Ledger and want to learn more about the Celtic heritage and Roman Empire, please buy this series. You won't be dissappointed.Heath Ledger Rocks!!!"
5,Extremely well done,"This series is a total delight with no disappointment for me. Being a fan of medieval and movies about old Roman and Greek times, this one is another welcome addition to my library of ""fun to watch"" series. The cast was well chosen and each new character seems to add to the series. The Celtic type music score is no disappointment either. Even better, so far no ""flying dragons"" or hyped up ideas such as many other series of this type so often have. Beautiful filmography. This series plays in good clarity and sound as well has subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing. This is something often missing even in higher priced series and is very essential for someone over 62 such as myself. I wish I had to money to buy this set for for many persons on my Christmas list this year. The main star being Heath Ledger doesn't hurt either. He is very talented"
3,Not as good as I remember!,"I first saw this series when I was in college and I thought it was pretty good, 4 stars or so, but now watching it, I find the acting is lacking and the story line is not as good as I remember it!"
4,"If you are planning a wedding, this is a must read!","Weddings are naturally stressful events. So many details to remember and people to please. This book does a great job of helping you get a handle on the details, while having a laugh in the process. It's a must read for any bride who wants to laugh (as well as cry) at her wedding."
1,Not funny at all....,"This book was a pain to get through, even though it was so small. I do not feel that the ""guide"" provided me with any information that I did not already know, which was what I hoped to get from it. Also, I could not even imagine using the gift receiving section, as the possible responses ranged from childish to just plain stupid. I really wanted to like this book, but I could not. Instead, the book that I got my fiance, Peter van Dijk's ""The Clueless Groom's Guide,"" was much more informative, not to mention funnier."
1,Not so funny,"Sorry, but I thought this book was a waste of money. It read (and looked) like a high school publishing club project that somebody created in about thirty minutes. There are so many other cool books out there for brides-to-be! Don't buy this one--it contains nothing new (including humor) and is not helpful in the least."
1,Not worth the money! Look for it at Garage Sales,I just glanced at this book when I received it and was really disappointed you get maybe tops 100 words on a page every other page. Pictures take up half the pages and they are drawn cartoon pictures so nothing you need to see. Skip this book!
1,Gold finches caught in metal ground stand,"I used the metal base to set the bird bath in the ground. On two separate occasions, a gold finch became trapped in the metal bars of the stand by its wings. The first time it happened, I figured it was some kind of weird freak occurrence. The second time, I immediately took the bird bath down. Thankfully both times I was able to gently release the bird with no obvious damage. Please don't use this product with the metal gound stand."
1,Junk,"Run! Rust spots within weeks (the brass/copper finish is about a micron thick), rust HOLES within a year. Virtually impossible to install on the stand. This product is junk, junk, junk!"
2,"Politics, Not Philosophy","The title of this movie is misleading at best, complete BS at worst. Obviously, the creator of the film didn't take time to examine whether or not her own film was about philosophy or left-wing politics; such thoughtlessness only reaffirms particular biases and cliches--e.g. that all thinking individuals also happen to be socialists and in favor of central planning. Complete rubbish. I was a philosophy major and I used to teach philosophy. I would never present this movie to my students as an introduction to the philosophical life, but as a wonderful example of how self-affirming biases and groupthink can produce coherent works of political propaganda. Should be re-titled ""Socialist Ideas Presented and Unexamined By Socialist Thinkers."" That would be an apt title and do the film some justice in the service of truth. But the current title--what a sham! This movie makes Michael Moore look honest..."
5,Love the Life Chnge Series,While not 100% stand alone I love the Life Change series. I'm reading through Revelations now but I thumbed through this book and it's just as good as the Proverbs and John book I've used. I have 9 of these books and I hope to buy one of each before they disappear.
3,Same old McSweeney's,"When I purchased this book, I expected humor that was new, that was unpublished, that was quirky. I was a third right. It was quirky, and while I hadn't read some of them, most of them I had read(...) That being said, the stories and the lists are funny, and it's a great bathroom book. just don't expect anything new."
5,Modernize your Bathroom,"Great piecemeal read. Not meant for anything but a bit at a time.McSweeney recycles and I for one am quite happy about it. Comfortably nestled in between an old tattered Mad ""Worst of"" and a classic ""Buy this magazine or we'll shoot this dog"" 70's Nat. Lampoon cover, this is unquestionably superior bathroom fare.Everything is short, simple, intelligent stupidity that will either get you to laugh or induce peristalsis. Either way you win. Treasure like this doesn't come along all that often.Only complaint is they left out one my favorite McSweeny's bits of nonsense, The Rollercoaster Ride, which years ago I gave away to some Swiss girl on a beach in the South Pacific. Kinda worth it.I know its just plain stupid. But its just plain 'I wish I had thought of that and gotten published with it' stupid.Like I said, intelligent stupidity, often absurd, and it has a great C. Burns cover. Genius."
4,Food Costing Gospel,"The Book of Yields; is just great for getting the specific ingredients you need. It's helpful with getting the accuracy for costing out the plate as well. Great book every culinary student should invest in one of these books. The book is full of all spices and produce that you've ever heard of, it's a great item when you need to know how to calculate the portions of an item. It's great for converting from pounds to ounces also."
5,the book of yields:Accuracy in food costing,This book is the bench mark for menu planning and writing projects. The old one works but I enjoyed this I know that I should not need a new one for a long time. It has the new sugar substitutes.a great book
2,One of the many text books at CIA,This book is great for creating recipes although there is much infomation missing. With certain products it is unclear how to calculate the yield. Many say the CD helped with this problem but the CD has never worked for me or any of my class mates.Thanks CIA :)
2,A little flimsy...but good product overall.,Feels like it just might break at any moment.Does a great job skimming small ponds and pools though
4,Value pen,This is a classic style Cross pen but has got a plus in design that is given by its colourful body.
1,damages hardwood floors,"I bought the double unit and started using this product at Christmas with the pine scent. However, even on the absolute lowest setting the scent is still very strong and it seems to burn off very quickly. Only a week later both sides were almost half gone. I used the unit since then with a couple different scents, but this last time, much to my horror I realized that one of the sides had leaked and destroyed the finish on my hardwood floor! The oily product has stained a big spot on the floor directly beneath and has caused the varnish to lift and bubble. I have tossed the entire unit along with the refills into the garbage. I will not buy this type of product again."
1,CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,As I have not received my coffee pot it would be hard to comment.My ordered was suppose to have arrived days ago.
1,Uniquely English? Don't count on it!,"I knew something was wrong as soon as I pulled this out of the box. The feel of the pot was all wrong- nothing like other Royal Doulton pieces I own. The outside felt rough and the piece thick and clumsy. Thinking maybe there I'd been a victim of ""bait and switch"" I checked for the familiar stamp on the bottom. and there I beheld in all it's glory the tell-all phrase ""made in China"". I guess the low price should have been my first clue. Apparently Royal Doulton is doing a little out-sourcing and sadly (but not suprisingly) the quality is simply NOT up to par. What a shame- a company cultivates the trust of its customers through many generations only to wreck it completely through stupid decisions like this one. Sorry, but it once meant more to bear the label ""Royal Doulton"" than the familiar floral patterns on the side of the pot. How utterly dissapointing."
1,Trivial Pursuit,"Very disappointingNot NEARLY enough Q&A;Played twice and already the same questions come up.SPORT section focusing on US sportsThe original PC game was much, much better (it included video clips etc)Could be far more international"
5,Pleased,"I got this book for a student who doesn't have much time, and he was very happy with it. It's possible to literally begin and end a prayer/section in just a few minutes or less. Inspiring prayers."
1,bad,"Written soon after VMF 212 came back after his tour of duty in the Pacific, this book lacks detail and, altough the writer interviewed surviving pilots personally, it clearly lacks information concerning the enemy ( the Japs ), the general war scenario, etc. It's clearly just another ""patriotic"" book written during WW II to feed the American war machine. Very weak."
1,VERY BAD,"Books written during the War normally are very bad, like ""GOD IS MY CO-PILOT"", for example. There is censorship problem, excess of patriotism, total lack of informations concerning the other side (the enemy side)and narrative tales normally full of hate for the enemy (of course). This is another book. The writer, an accomplished newsman, really tried to write a good book, but it failed miserably. For you, an air-combat reader, this will be a great deception..."
1,FIghter squadron at guadalcanal - so what??!!,"Hastily written still during the war, this book is nothing more than war-time propaganda, when ""Brave AMericans"" at the cited VMF Marine fighter squadron defeats the dumb and evil Japanese. THe book has no coehesion, it was clearly written without the benefit of enemy sources, it has almost none description of air combat, all in all is so boring and adds almost none new information for those even vaguely familiar with the war in the Pacific. A total waste of time, I tell you."
3,"Good, but not fantastic!","Writer Max Brand (who died in 1944 in Italy, as a war correspondent)did a good job interviewing the members of VMF 212, in 1943,after their tour of duty in Guadalcanal, in 1942. The book is good, but not so action-orientated like his tittle leads you to think. So , the reader must spend time to see how were the difficulties to build the fighter strips in Pacific, etc, which, as the book only now was published, is quite old history for WW II students."
3,Could have been a lot better!,"For anyone who has read any of the other historical mystery anthologies, this latest will seem weak in comparison. I'm trying to recall at least one story that stood out from the rest...can't do it!"
1,Tremendously Depressing,"I read this book in German, however the idea is still the same. This book is absolutely a terrifying book to be given to children. The idea that somehow children should be happy or even excited with their parents ""unmarriage"" or divorce is completely dillusional. As if kids whose parents are going through divorce need the added pressure of feeling they must behave the same way that Paula and Demetrius do. In addition to that, most kids may wonder how come, unlike in the story, their parents aren't living next door to each other and that they can visit them anytime they please. Absolutely the worst children's book I've ever seen. This should be taken off the market."
1,Appaling,I was appalled as I flipped through this book at the library.Treating divorce like a lighthearted event; a party? Come on!The idea that any real minister would gleefully participate in celebrating a divorce is just unbelievable.This books makes light of a terrible tragedy.
5,Works great!,"I used this mold to make chocolates for our son's fire truck party, they turned out great! I used the ladder mold to make 2 white chocolate ladders to put on the side of his fire truck cake, they came out great too!"
1,Don't waste your money!,I purchased this trying to learn more about my new puppy.....very frustrated! The content & the way it is delivered seems like it is for 5 year old children. I am very dissapointed & would urge someone else to shop around to find a different product!
2,"If really interested in SEM, do not buy this book.","I have just browsed through ""Basics of Structural Equation Modeling."" Quite frankly, I am very disappointed. The title implies the book is concerned with SEM; however, SEM is actually addressed from Chapter 8 on, as explicitly stated by the author in the first paragraph on page 178: ""This chapter presents the basics of latent variable SEM."" Pages 29-173 (61% of the book) is spent addressing path analysis, with one chapter addressing factor analysis. Pages 177-270 (39% of the book) is spent addressing SEM. If I had wanted to buy a book on path analysis, I would have bought a book on path analysis!"
4,microphoto is a little smaller,remember that the microphoto has a larger screen and is smaller than the zen microgood product though
2,"A Colossal, Wooden, Celluloid Mess Neither Scary nor Satisfying","The inclusion of slasher royalty - Camp Crystal Lake maniac Betsy Palmer - does little to redeem this half-baked muddle. The elements are all there (prior evil; a secluded country locale; Halloween houseguests; Native American legend; and a bizarre, life-sized wooden mannequin), yet nothing ever seems to fall into place as it should. Lame, misplaced attempts at one-liners only make things worse (""I'm gonna clear-cut your a**!""). In the end, the result isn't the least bit scary or satisfying; there's really no one to root for, as everyone in this colossal wooden, celluloid mess deserves to go up in flames."
4,Buy when you are in school!,"I purchased this reference guide as I was preparing for my NCIDQ exam to become a licenensed designer. While there was pertinant information I wished that someone had reccomended that I purchase it as I entered into design school.There are many useful on Human anthropometrics, the use of space and environmental systems. However, there isn't much information on the architectural aspects of interior design (nominal lumber sizes/ building products & materials etc.)Francis Ching (or his editor) is very good at laying out his books so that design professionals can easily read through, or can use them to reference when looking for specific information.A great addition the the library of Interior Designers and students."
4,Excellent illustrations,"No regrets for having bought the book. Excellent illustrations, something you can refer to over and over again!"
4,very helpful,this book was a great help to me as I am studying interior design. I can recommend this book to anyone in the same position as me.
5,"Great Information, good pictures, step by step process.","This book has given me the knowledge to start my colt off myself saving me hundreds of dollars on professional training. The step by step process and the pictures are very informational. I like that there are pictures to show what exactly they are doing. The author shows that not all horses are a ""dream"" to train and shows that some do protest to what is being done. It is a true representation. I recommend this book to someone who has been afraid to try it themselves. It can really help you to become proficiant from the start and help build the respect and bond you need from your horse."
5,Good sound fundamentals for training young horses to ride!!,"This is the real deal!!!!!!!!!!!! Not a bunch of crap like the popular ""horse whisperer"" fad that showed up after the movie."
3,"I'm happy using generic FJM bags (from Amazon), 5 for $10!","I just love my two Miele cannister vacuums, they're great. We live on all tile floors with 10 dogs and a few cats, so everyday I vacuum up a ton of animal hair, and I go through vacuum bags quite frequently. I'm not paying $19 for four bags, that's ridiculous! I e-mailed Miele, they told me about how much better filtration the new bags afforded. I explained that filtration quality means nothing when cleaning very coarse animal hair. I'm not living in a ""clean Room"" at Intel!I noticed that Bosch has also raised their cannister bag prices, so maybe it's a German thing. I started buying generic ""FJM"" 5 bags for $10 from Amazon, which work just fine. These cheap bags have a cardboard connection at top, instead of plastic, but doesn't matter. So I'm happy now. I'm not paying $5 per Miele bag!Miele Style F,J,M Canister Vacuum Bags Microfiltration with Closure - 5/2 Pack"
2,Wrong Product sent,I purchased the Miele bag and they sent me the new Miele Bag called HyClean. The new product includes one less bag and thats why I did not want it. The picture on Amazon was for the old bags.Update: I called them and explained this to them and they agreed to send me another bag to cover the one short. They have updated their images but it seems it did not flow to Amazon yet. I give them credit for addressing this problem.
5,Miele vacuum bags,"I purchased 2 boxes of FJM vacuum bags which should have contained 5 bags each. However, I received the newer bags that are now made and contain only 4 bags. The picture on Amazon clearly showed the box that contained the 5 bags. I called the seller and explained this to him and he said he has been trying to clear this problem up, but Amazon has not corrected it as of yet. He was so nice that he sent me the extra 2 bags that I had expected to get. I hope for his sake correction is made soon."
1,BEWARE OF THIS!,"Beware of this item. I ordered ""8 bags with 4 filters"" from Go Vacuum and received 4 bags with 2 filters. The guy at Go Vacuum said Amazon is advertising it wrong and that there have never been 8 bags with 4 filters in this style. Even the box that came has a sticker on it that says ""FJM Miele Bags 8 Bags with 4 Filters"". It's wrong. The guy at Go Vacuum said I could just ""send them back if I didn't like them."" Haha."
4,Meile filters,Product works very well. Especially as we had 2 dogs and lots of dog hair on floors. The systems also filters the exhaust air as well.
5,Who likes to vacuum??!!!,"I hate to vacuum, but I love this vacuum cleaner, and delivery of the bags was quick and easy...."
3,Sent them back as I got a different model of vaccum,"The vaccum I ordered was no longer available, so I was sent a ""newer"" model that took a different bag."
5,Best bags,These are very high quality replacement bags. Very easy to install and use. Wish more came in a single container.
5,They are just what I expected-I am satisfied with my purchase-it is a stretch to say I love it-they are vacuum bags!,my rating meansI got what I expected in the time frame that I thought I would.don't have to love it to be a satisfied customer.
3,"looks ok, but not matching the title of the product.","From the product listed on Amazone, in the features section, it says ""New Hyclean FJM Bags"", but what I got was ""AirClean Vacuum Bags"" ."
3,good bags,"This are well made bags ,but they did not fit my miele canister ,I have a s 248 not sure if I may have to order a different sizeother than that the bags are the very good quality."
3,standrd product- good,"The Miele vacuum is good and the bags work fine. Our 50-year old electrolux works as well, althoughthese bags are purportedly removing finer particles.I marked this down because both boxes we ordered were damaged in shipping. Just the boxes the bags come in, but who wants to look at half crushed boxes on their shelves for months?"
4,"Works great, pricey as all hell.","Works great, pricey as all hell. I don't use anything but these for my Miele but at $17+ a box for a vacuum bag its highway robbery. They come with more filters than you will ever need or find a use for.Note the listing with the different box design is the same darn bag. No difference at all. Fits my Neptune perfectly."
4,Expensive but good quality,"These vac bags are well made and fit well. However, they seem very expensive and I can't afford to replace them too often so I try not to fill them too quickly by using the broom first to get the bulk of the dirt."
3,what this book is about,"This Book Is From The Forgotten Realms Box Set.This Book Is A Complete Cyclopedia Of The Fabulous Forgotten Realms, For Abeir Toril To Zhentil Keep."
5,****ing Awesome,"This is my favorite of the Tiller Galloway books, and also my introduction to David Poyer's work. I knew nothing about the world of cave diving going in, and now I am fascinated! Tiller is a great main character, especially because of his flaws (alcoholism, greed, impulsiveness). Many of the underwater sequences had me holding my breath. I hope David Poyer brings Tiller back for more in another book, but only if it can live up to this one...!"
3,Here comes claustrophobia,"The descriptions of diving in this book are vivid and the cave sequences will give you a sudden fear of tight places. The hero, however, has a rotten core which turns me off. I would never go diving with him for fear of never coming back up."
3,Feeling a Little Out of Breath,"This being my first David Poyer novel, I truly did not know what the expect. I picked this book up because I am a fan of Benchley and Alten who both write thrillers about the deep. The first thing I found refreshing was that Poyer did not go to deep in past Tiller Galloway stories. You can pick this book up and not feel that you are missing anything.The wonderful thing about this book about cave divers, is Poyer's ability to make you feel ""closed in"" almost out of breath, during the cave diving scenes. I enjoyed most of the characters including Galloway's son, and group of friends.The ending is somewhat dissapointing. It is exciting, but it gets a little too far fetched at times. I do recommend this book, despite the ending and it's shortcomings."
4,Life after Dirk Pitt.,"This was my fourth book by Poyer. I had been looking for another author after finishing everything from Clive Cussler. Although Tiller Galloway is no Dirk Pitt (from Cussler's books),I still find his character exciting.I'm not a diver so I only assume that at least some of the details are accurate. Nevertheless, Poyer keeps you spellbound with his description of the various dive equipment and situations encountered while under water.I used to think that being a professional diver was glamourous but after reading Poyer's accounts of the physical hardships encountered when working undersea I've gained a new appreciation for the individuals who dive for a living.In summary, Poyer's books with the Tiller Galloway character are quite interesting."
4,Great book,"Really shows Poyer's extensive diving knowledge. Anybody that knows diving and especcially cave diving can appreciate this one. I love the Tiller Galloway novels. Some of Poyers other stuff doesnt do it for me, but the Tiller novels really have a great feel for the water and diving. Love them all."
2,"OUCH! No Wonder ""The Coop"" Gave Up The Bottle!","I love Alice Cooper... Let me state that again: I LOVE ALICE COOPER!Too bad this CD aint him.""The Coop"" gives all during his live shows and I should know, because I've seen nearly every tour since Killer. He is a master showman and except for this particular period in his career his shows were the stuff of legend.This era in Alice's career the shows were the stuff of Seagrams VO and Budweizer. He slept through this tour... a tragedy he readily admits.If you really want a great live document do yourself a favor and pick up ""A Fistful Of Alice"" from this site and you'll see why people rave about this rock legend."
2,Uncaring Alice,"It is well known that Alice Cooper puts on the best live shows around,which makes me sad to have to hear this album.The tracks culled for THE ALICE COOPER SHOW are from the LACE AND WHISKEY tour (more commonly known as THE KING OF THE SILVER SCREEN tour);even Alice admits today his senses were running on auto pilot at the time.As a result , Alice does not seem to be giving his usual 100%. Maybe it was recorded near the end of the tour? That would explain the Hollywood Vampires sounding like they'd rather be back at the motel than on the stage.This is as low as Alice could get. Thankfully,he picked himself up.Still,if you want an Alice Cooper live album,get FISTFUL OF ALICE."
3,This is a classic Alice live recording...,"As an avid fan since childhood, I have seen Alice change with the times. From shock-rock to punk-rock to heavy-metal then back to shock-rock. This album only has tracks dating up to 1977. So if your looking for ""Hey Stupid"" try another album. I would recomend this one for nostalgic purposes."
2,More fluff then filler,"The problem with this album is: 1) it's way to short. Most of the songs were cut, and/or edited for the recording of this album. It seems like they were trying to get as many songs in as they could, without having to make this a double length album, which is what it should have been. and 2) the sound quality is minimal. it is very thin with virtually little range. Reminds me of listening to online stations at 56k.This album could have been so much more but it seems to have been either hastly put together or very little was spent on the engineering of it. I've had this album it came out, and I still am very disappointed every time I revisit it."
2,Uninspired Alice Live Album,"Alice Cooper, is the greatest showman ever. His stage shows are the best in the business and that is why this album is a surprise on how poor it is. Alice sounds like he is going through the motions probably due to exhaustion from intensive touring and at the time he was drinking heavily. Fourtunately, though Alice worked through this rough time and has got his act back together."
2,One of Alice's weakest albums,"This is without question one of Alice's most weakest albums. This was recorded during his hazy years when he was suffering from alchoism, and believe me, it shows from the weak performance he gives. Most of the songs run short with lyrics missing, and thats what really kills this album. Even Alice admits that this cd fails to capture him live."
3,Alice Cooper - 'The Alice Cooper Show' (Warner Brothers),"Not near as good as his more recent 'Fistful Of Alice' live CD(see my review).The reason I'm giving this release a three-star rating is because I remember just how thrilled I was when it first came out.These days,you'd better be a major Alice Coooper fan,almost a nut to fully appreciate this reissue.'The Alice Cooper Show' was apparently recorded off his 1977 'Lace And Whiskey' tour.Overall,the live mix is okay,but it's sort of weak.At least that's what I thought.Tunes that were decent to experience all over again were the opener ""Under My Wheels"",""Sick Things"",""Is It My Body"",""Billion Dollar Babies"",""Devil's Food"",""I Love The Dead"" and ""School's Out"".There are three ballads here,""Only Women Bleed""(that's okay to still hear)and two that I'm SO glad he doesn't perform anymore.""You And Me"" and ""I Never Cry"".Yeah,I know.I've spoken to so many long time Cooper fans,that swear the first time they heard this song,THEY almost cried."
1,Defective right out of the box,"It's pretty frustrating when you go through the complicated process of connecting up a home theater receiver and then find that it doesn't work. The right front channel was weak and distorted. This was the first Pioneer product I've bought so I can't say how common it is but as the saying goes, you only get one chance to make a first impression."
4,Very good entry level receiver,"I bought this from Bestbuy during thanksgiving sale for $109. For that price, this is the only receiver with 100watt/channel & 5.1 output . Note that the optical input connector on this receiver works perfectly with toslink cable. I paired this receiver with klipsch F-3 and 10"" klipsch sub-woofer. The inputs are from my desktop(4 channels, front and surround) and macbook(optical input). I am happy with the sound quality except for couple of minor issues. When I put my ears close to the speakers, I hear a hissing sound even with no input. Also I found the right speaker gets more power than the left one."
3,I couldn't get it to work - but got a full refund,"I bought this product online at Amazon and after to three hours of trying to get to work including calling technical support (Tech support number is in the owners manual - that's a good thing). In any event, I returned the product to the vendor and got a full refund. So overall 5 stars for Amazon and the vendor and only one star for the product -- so I'll rate it three star overall."
2,cheep necklace,This item came promptly and I like the way it looked...but in a matter of 2 days the chain broke and I now have nothing to show for it...maybe better just to get a pendent with no chain..if thats all they can afford to put on their product..
2,Get what you pay for,"Did not work very well, a little dissapointed but it didn't cost that much so I guess you get what you pay for. Do have to say that we sent it back and the company was wonderful and took care of it immediately."
3,good for a child,my 6 year old wanted a telescope for christmas. I bought this on sale and initially my son was very disappointed with how small it is. It has turned out okay as he can manage it by himself. good for sightseeing in the day rather than for stargazing
5,excelent subwoofre,"good product its an excelent subwoofer it worths the money and i would recommend it, im am planning to buy one more"
3,Nice but not perfect.Nice but not perfect.,"I've had the EluminX for almost a year now, the feel and layout of this board is much like that of a laptop. The illumination will draw many gamers to this keyboard but I don't think it is well suited to the abuse that game play dishes out. This keyboard is delicate! My ""D"" key stopped working recently from all the fps abuse I was laying onto it. I just ordered the Saitek Eclipse to replace it and will review that once I have more time on it.This keyboard would be perfect for people using it in a media PC or any non game rig. Side note... you have to really be diligent on keeping it clean as you will see all the crumbs and stuff that falls between the keys.Pros:Cool factorReally looks great in a dark roomNice feelCons:Very delicate.Only available in legacy PS/2 connector.Illumination flickers from time to timeLock keys are GREEN LED's"
1,Pretty . . . and Flimsy,"Cool glowing lighted keyboard . . . combined with flimsy build quality and it's a gigantic waste of money. If you are a power user or have a tendency to be a little firm on the keyboard, do not buy this model. It is not sturdy at all. If you like the cool glow, get a lava lamp instead plus a real keyboard-- and have some money left over."
1,Doesn't last,"I thought this wasn't a bad keyboard when i first got it, even though it was clear that the key contacts aren't very good (noticeable if you're a very fast typist and, in fact, some of the contacts have become worse and worse over time). But the real issue here is that the lighting became less and less bright from one month to the next and finally completely went within a year. No much point of having spent this kind of money on a lighted keyboard if the ""lighted"" part lasts less than a year! I am now shopping for another lighted keyboard (not this brand, of course) but saw this and thought i would warn other shoppers."
5,Really Nice,This is the best illuminated keyboard out there. Only thing i don't like is the low height of the keys but i quickly got used to it and love it.
1,Smalll Fry,"This is NOT a Military Combat Axe. It is tiny and my first thought was that is it ""cute"". Although it does ship with an incredably sharp axe blade, there is not enough weight or leverage to make it useful. Only the leading edge is sharpened and even the other pointed end is really rounded so as to be dull and ""safe"". Although this product is disappointing I have to give 5 STARS to the company that shipped it. Really quick delivery and excellent communication. Pachi Paradice did a great job. I have ordered several items from them and will continue to do so."
3,A good start,"Ultramarine's first album displays all the hallmarks of their splendid work to come: The funky bass lines, the mix of organic and electronic instrumentation that gives it its warmth, the found vocals. If this album isn't as good as their later albums, that's only because their later albums are so incredibly witty. This is, after all, the way it's supposed to work: You're supposed to get better as you go along."
3,Not the best version,"I have almost all the versions of Four Last Songs by various singers. Although this is a good version, the version I like best is the recording made in 1953 (mono) by Lisa della Casa with Karl Bohm. She prevents the music from descending into sentimentality. The version Kiri Te Kanawa recorded with Andrew Davis has the best music but the singing is not up there with the best. If you like Four Last Songs check these out."
3,A GOOD RECORDING,"This may be damning praise, but this recording of the ""4 Last Songs"" is good--not great, far from the best--but good. Renee Fleming sings well, if not rapturously (& anyone who knows this music, knows that it must and should be rapturous) but the Houston Symphony Orchestra under Christoph Eschenbach is simply not first rate. Or perhaps it is the way RCA has recorded them? The 5 symphonic songs are perfectly ok and the suite from ""Rosenkavalier"" never quite lifts you out of your seat....and again, it should. I am not upset that I purchased this album, but i think that since I have other recordings (Elizabeth Schwartzkopf, Jessye Norman, Gundula Janowitz)I will let this CD gather dust on the shelf."
3,"Voluptuous voice, treacly interpretation","I am in total agreement with the one-star reviewer who complains that these Four Last Songs are fussy, slow, and mannered. Fleming's arch posing make Jessye Norman sound positively unaffected. The whole CD amounts to a showcase for Fleming's radiant voice, with no imaginative regard for the words (despite the fact that Fleming sings excellent German and studied there on a Fulbright years ago).Eschenbach tries to outdo his soloist in treacly grandness. I found their performance impossible to listen to, and the same habits continue into the other miscellaneous orchestral songs, though a few escape being totally ruined. The Rosenkavalier Suite is spectcualry recorded and gets straightforward condcuting from Eschenbach.Critics have adored this CD since its release, and I am completely baffled why. May those who enjoy it continue to."
3,quick snack,"It is difficult for people with multiple food allergys to find a quick snack.this does fit that need,but I probably wont be buying this again. Very small servings and not very tasty.It does fills the need for something safe to eat."
2,Good....if you like cardboard,"I bought these going by reviews online, but now I have boxes of something inedible. I guess I will be out the money for this one. Can't think of what else to do with them...........don't waste your money. I know it is hard to find things without allergens, but it wasn't worth it for me!!"
2,"Cheaper Ingredients, Lowered Quality","I was extremely disappionted when I opened my shipment of Enjoy Life On The Go Bars (Very Berry, Carmel Apple, and Cocoa Loco). The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients."
2,From Great to So-So,"These used to be my favorite bars from any brand. The company changed the recipe, and now I am really disappointed with the taste. I'm going to cancel my order subscription or reduce it."
1,Not impressed,Not impressed at all - first they are so small it was a joke. Second the taste is horrible. I have tried the other flavors and they aren't bad but this one has no distinct taste and not something I will buy again
2,The incredible shrinking bar...,"These have been a favorite of my son for three years now - their convenience, coupled with the fact that they are GF make them a staple at our house. That said, if they get any smaller, they need to start marketing them as cereal instead of bars. We already pay a premium to have food that he can eat without getting sick, and it's hard enough to get him to eat enough - don't reduce the serving size on top of that!If nothing else, the picture on the front of the box needs to be changed as it does not accurately reflect what is contained within. Heck, they may as well put a picture of a chocolate cake on it - there's that much difference between the advertising and the item itself."
3,small things come in big packages...,"As a parent of kids with multiple food allergies, we're thrilled to have companies like Enjoy Life that make allergen-free treats. These, however, are not worth the cost. Each bar comes in a package that's about twice its size, making you feel like Enjoy Life is trying to pull a fast one on you. As several other reviewers noted, the bars are dry and not so flavorful. We'll probably keep a box of these in the pantry to vary our options a bit but will more often go with tastier take along treats made by Glutino, Oskri, and others."
4,An allergy-friendly snack that actually tastes good,"These bars are a lifesaver for people with food allergies or a gluten intolerance. They do not contain any of the most common allergens or gluten, and they actually taste good! AND they also don't have a ton of sugar or other additives. It's a rare treat in the hypoallergenic food market."
2,deceptively small,"Be aware that this bar is half the size of the standard breakfast/snack bars. If I had paid attention, I would have compared the size listed on the boxes but I went off of the size of the box. It's the same as other boxes but the bar is literally half the size. They could have saved a lot of packaging. The taste was ok. A little dense. If the cost was half that of other bars, I would buy some more."
1,Definitely NOT for me!,"I am not allergic to anything except lactose, but my daughter who I'm nursing is dairy and egg intolerant, so I have to be on a very strict diet for her. It's hard to find snacks and sweets to satisfy me, so I bought a few different items from the health food store to test. These definitely didn't pass the test! I thought they tasted awful! Hopefully my 2 year old will think they are good and I don't have to waste them! I won't be buying this particular item again. Although I've loved the other products I've purchased from Enjoy Life! These were just a no-go for me."
4,Healthy and Tasty but Pricy,"These bars are tasty, with a pleasantly firm texture and a slightly more complex flavor than I've grown accustomed to in mass-produced cereal grain products. After a few bad experiences with bland, gummy gluten-free bars, I was pleased to discover that these were quite good. They took the edge of my hunger and gave me the nutrient boost I needed to reach the end of a long, hectic day.But each bar is tiny, about the length of my thumb. I needed more than half a box to get that nutrient boost, which at these prices is no small cost. I already know that gluten free food is pricier than unhealthy wheat alternatives, but if one snack costs as much as a fast food dinner, that really pinches my budget. So it's a tough trade-off between health and economy."
3,Weird sizing/So-So Taste,"I am allergic to peanuts and so was thrilled to see there is a Sunbutter bar version. However, I'm pretty let down. The bars are tiny - about 1/2 of the packet is bar and the other 1/2 is air. They are also, like a previous review said, random in their sizing - some are a full inch bigger or smaller than others. The taste is kind of bland, but I do think they're nice for a hiking/camping situation to have something with protein that is allergen-safe and easy to toss in a backpack."
2,The chocolate ones are much better,"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions. Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry. I threw them away. I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free."
4,great on the go snack or quick breakfast,"I always keep one or two in my bag, my son likes these. Also makes a nutritious breakfast when you're in a hurry"
2,"Great company, not our favorite item","I really love Enjoy Life's line of allergy-friendly products... their dairy-free mini chips are a staple on my pantry! I was excited to first try out these bars, as they're nut-free and would thus be appropriate for school snacks and lunches. Sadly, though, neither of my kids liked the flavor. My daughter also lamented the texture, which I have to agree is a little bit mealy. I know some love these, but I have found there are many other gluten-free snack bar options out there."
4,Tasty Snack,"In my constant search for gluten free products, I was happy to find this snack bar. Generally this type product leaves much to be desired, taste wise. I am very pleased with the taste of this bar and will continue to use it. I will probably end up trying all the flavors. I have been happy to find Amazon carries such a good variety of gluten free foods."
1,Not a happy camper!!!!,"My son does not like this new recipe. There aren't many snacks foods that he can have and he really enjoyed the old Caramel Apple Bars. So I bought a case of them thinking they were the same bars but in different packaging, I am very disappointed..."
3,A little to dry ! !,To be a Chewy item. It taste good and I liked it but I Needed to have something to drink with it. A little more juice in it may fix that. Good try Good Life.
4,good GF/allergy free product,"Great GF snack. I love carrying these in my work bag or purse for a quick energy snack. I was expecting that these would be soft and chewy like advertised on the box, but in reality, they are a lot tougher and harder. But, they taste great, and I can't find many GF snacks that fit that bill."
3,Be Very Berry Wary.,"They are OK, but my husband only eats them when we are in car. We keep them there for a celiac snack. (Hard to find when roaming around.) He won't eat them otherwise. They are definitely raspberry, but are kind of dry.We have never tried any other snack bars, so in all honesty they may be the norm. I don't know.We DO like Enjoy Life's other products.They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates."
4,Pug charm is a good buy,This little charm is beautiful. It is well worth the price. My only complaint is that it will need to be taken to a jeweler to be put on my bracelet. I would love to have one with a spring ring clasp so I could move/place it where I wanted.
1,Hater of women,"Rarely did I disagree more with an author. Unless this is a book written intentionally to startle and create sensation, I could not help to ask myself ""Where did THAT one come from?"" According to Mrs. Vilar, women are some sort of profiteering cold blooded reptilians unable of feelings (!?) They managed to piggyback their existence on the backs of men, who are the only driving force of society. Make of it what you want."
1,Former Manipulated Man,"I was manipulated by a cult that used this book as their Bible more than I was ever manipulated by a woman. They claimed to have a way of life better than any other, but it turns out they are con artists and scumbags that just use people to satisfy their own sick needs for approval, power, sex, money, and attention. They go to AA meetings and preach this book behind the scenes, and try to control others. They are dangerous psychopaths. Beware of anyone giving you this book and giving you advice on how to live. Now, I am free and live my own life without relying on extremist views or cons artists who only want to control me, not help me."
4,a part of the reality,"I am a woman but I have to say that yes, I know women who are like this.In fact I know a lot of women who are like Vilar described.The reality is much more complex, and it is different from country to country. I come from Eastern-Europe, and there it is normal for women to have a full job and to take care of the household as well.Also the women from there do not have all the domestic facilities from the Western-Europe or from USA.It is not easy for women from there and not always the men will help them. There, I would say that is the revert situation.Finally I think, taking advantage is not just a female characteristic, it is human."
5,The bible,"The truth contained in this book is the most difficult thing for a man raised in the US to accept. Every cell in your body will recoil at first reading. You will think of every excuse and exception imaginable to not accept the simple truth presented in the pages. You will never get much support from either your male or female friends; However, if you dare to accept what is plainly in front of your eyes, you will be rewarded with a life free from bondage and filled with self esteem. I recommend this book very highly.. Read it at least once a week for a year. Slowly but surely, you will see the truth everywhere around you. You will wake up to many unpleasant facts about society but also realize the many wonderful choices available. My life has gotten better ever since I read this book 5 years ago. Best of luck!"
3,Some other books on same topic better,"Interesting historical read, but not an easy one. I would recommend more contemporary books on the same subject unless you really have the time and energy to dig into this particular tome."
3,Cookware,"I like the set. The packaging the set arrived in was a bit worn, but the pots are fine for stainless steel cookware."
5,Worry,"My daughter picked up this book in the children section of the local library and we both learned some things about worrying. For example, as we read the book I began to realize that small children worry about school, big things, small things, and noises, and etc. The book reminded me that I worried as a child too. Most important, if you have a child that worries, the story will help your kid understand that it is natural to worry."
5,a great book for kids...,My five year old daughter and I read this book last night. I really liked how the author simply explained about anxiety. He puts into words what I couldn't and helped my daughter understand more about what she's feeling and why. I especially liked how Wemberley's parents were in the book.
3,Wemberly Worried,This book looks like it has been either kept or bought from the library. All the pages are intact but the book cover is not in the best condition.
3,Disappointed,"I bought this book for my 4 year old granddaughter who loved Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse. She is not a worrier, and didn't understand why Wemberly was worried about everything, especially about such a fun thing as going to school.Children who have had a year or two of successful school or nursury school experience may be too old for this story."
5,IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND ANYTHING NOT TO LIKE IN THIS WORK.,"This is one of those real surprises. What seems simple at first is really rather profound. All little kids worry (as do most adults) and they worry about the strangest little things. But we have to remember that what is little to us, is rather large to a first grader. This little book is perfect to read to the young child and a perfect lead-in to a great discussion of why not to worry and to put everthing into prespective. The text is quite simple and to the point. The art work is great and goes well with the text. The book is funny and the book is true and it has a great ending that actually teaches a lesson. What more could you want? I read this one to my classes all the time and have yet to find a child who could not relate. Recommend this one highly."
4,Good kitten food,"I was fostering 7 kittens and all 7 of them loved this brand of kitten food. I like what I pay for the price and the ingredients. It's not the best top shelf ingredients for cat food, but it's better for the other brands in the same price range. My kittens love eating it straight up and I feel better about feeding them."
2,I think it's stale.,"When the box arrived, the bottom was open and the bag of cat food was open inside of the zippered plastic bag. I think it probably fell out of the box causing the bag to open or something. It took about a week to get here so I don't know how long it was open. The cats still eat it but I don't know... I just get a feeling that they don't think it's as good as it usually is. I hope there is no penalty if I cancel my subscription for this. Something like this though is why I was worried about starting Amazon subscriptions to things. I've started to buy a lot of every day items through Amazon after I found out I could have them delivered to my home so conveniently, but I am still a fairly new member."
4,Great Compact Guide,"I was looking for something compact that I could fit in a pocket for those evenings when we would go out for meteor showers.I really helps pass the time to learn about the constellations, the layout was clear and the explanations brief.It's a great beginner's book."
4,Great for Beginners,"As a novice star gazer, I was so excited when I opened this book. It gives easy to read maps of the sky, in the various seasons. It also gives a little bit of detailed information about the different constellations. My children and I have already been able to pick out things in the night sky that we have been unable to identify previously."
4,GREAT TO READ,A great book to read if you've ever wondered about our universe. It's writter in a way so that anybody could understand it. Read this book and you'll surely enjoy it.
5,Odol Mouthwash Concentrate - From Germany,"I have used Odol as my mouthwash all my life, as did my parents who came here from Europe. It is very refreshing and different from the usual American mouthwash, as you only need to place a few drops into a tumbler of water. It is worth a try I would say. OdolOdol Concentrated Mouthwash - 5 Oz"
2,Ingredients and Pouring it,"First things first.... I agree with the other reviews that this mouthwash is nice to use. But I won't be buying it again for 2 reasons....1) It has Sodium Saccharide in it. I looked everywhere for ingredients before buying this but decided to just get it. I'm still going to use it but I was wanting to avoid certain ingredients in getting a good quality mouthwash and this was one of the ingredients I was trying to avoid.2) I can't pour with this bottle. The bottle is glass and everytime I try to get out a few drops... I end up pouring way more than I wanted, probably like 20 drops.If those 2 aspects don't bother you, I think everything else about this is great. It leaves the mouth feeling great and refreshed."
5,great,Using only a few of these concentrated drops at a time this mouthwash beats logging around big bottles of mouthwash. It last's for ever.
1,Awful,"Do not waste your time or money on this POC. Apparently Atari bought Humongous and then created this game as a follow on title to the popular (deservedly so) Putt-Putt series. There is NOTHING in this game that even remotely resembles the fun problem solving activities present in the earlier titles. Purely arcade type, and extremely boring at that. Stay Away!"
1,Buy Putt-Putt Enters the Race Instead!,"Pep's Birthday Surprise is a definite let-down from Putt-Putt Enters the Race! The major flaw in the software is that the game is less open-ended and too full of animated scenes ... the charm of the Putt-Putt games is that kids are encouraged to use critical thinking skills and to figure out (sometimes obscure) problems. These features are curtailed in this particular game, as if the designers have lost faith in their audience's ability to problem solve and to do multi-step reasoning ... A minor but disconcerting feature is that Putt-Putt's voice has dropped in pitch, which will prove very distracting to Putt-Putt parent veterans!"
1,very disappointing,"My four year old and I played this, and neither one of us could wait for it to end. The game takes a long time to change from scene to scene, so much so that we thought that the computer had frozen. The game is not challenging, fun, or educational but is in fact very boring and basic. Definitely not what we have come to expect from Humongous Entertainment."
5,YAY for Putt Putt!,"I was worried, because Humongous hasn't put out any new Putt Putt or Pajama Sam games for a while, but now there are new ones of each, and they are just as wonderful as all the others. Pep's Birthday Surprise is very sweet, and very simple, but is extremely entertaining and funny. The characters are really cute, especially the big hippy VW Bus named ""Sunshine"". The game changes a bit each time you play it, so it remains entertaining and challenging. Also, there are tons of different things in each room to click on, as well as some really fun mini-games. I buy these games for my nephew, but I always end up playing them myself. Definitely a bargain for some of the best children's software you're likely to find anywhere."
5,Fine Instrumental Hip Hop,"Science Fiction drops the best instrumental hip hop album I have heard in years. I was begining to get bored with this genre...it seemed that '96 was the peak. Sci Fi is originally form Nigeria...not sure how that effects the music, but his sound is completely unique. His vocals, which are featured on most of the tracks, complement the sound perfectly...basically used as textures and hooks. Anyone into DJ Shadow, DJ Krush, or early DJ Vadim should love this album."
4,Science Fiction redefines,"I have a collection of over 1000 CDs and this one will be at the top of the stack, a great mix of many styles. Would make a great film soundtrack!"
2,"Not bad, but i expected something different","I didn't like this CD. I heard comparisons to Rjd2, and all that, but I found it to be kinda boring. I liked maybe 3 songs, and this disc has quite a few songs on it. I was hoping it would grow on me, but it never did, so now its a coaster."
4,Tells me what I need to learn and know.,"I was told by my county's recruiter to get a book on behavior management to learn more about behavior management strategies. I found this book here and purchased and now am halfway through the book. I think this is an excellent book for anyone who wants to learn behavior management - especially educators. It discusses methods, techniques, assessment, and strategies to solve any behavior. It gives great examples as well. I would highly recommend getting this book."
2,Behavior Management,I originally purchased this for a class. It is not very user friendly and very dry to read. It is not a book I use as a resource ever.
3,Foot Valve,Kept pump clean and didn't loose prime. Didn't ship on time web sight incorrect about stock on hand. Great item using 4 hours a day for the last 30 days.
2,Not very pleased.,"I can't say much for this book. It's not a tool I found myself using at all. The lessons and ideas aren't bad, but could have been planned out better. Ofton I had to read and re-read a section to understand what was going on, since the ideas presented are in story form, not lesson form.I don't really use this book at all. I think How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way is a much better book that touches on similar concepts, granted not in a manga way."
2,Where oh Where?,"This book was ordered on the 2nd of December, and now it is February 1st, i still don't have this book. It was supposed to be a christmas present, and they keep changing the delivery dates.However, I have most of the series, and they're VERY good drawing/reference books. So if you really like it, its worth the wait."
3,Will Kenneth Wingle fix mine too?,"If I get one of these, will Kenneth Wingle fix mine too? I've seen some of MR's other studio scale replicas and have not been impressed, and I'm not about to spend two grand on something like this based on the little pictures MR provides. Of course the pictures they *do* provide are of a prototype instead of a shipping product, so it's hard to really know *what* you're actually buying. Kenneth's looks awesome, but I doubt mine would look that good without some customizing."
2,Not terribly excited,"I have not been terribly excited about this book. If you want to learn about group counseling there are more informative, more interesting, more stimulating and better written books than this one!"
2,SLOW DELIVERY,I promptly emailed the company and told them that I ordered the wrong book. I asked them if there was any way for them to stop my order. They never replied and it still too 2 weeks for me to recieve my book. When I received my book there was not receipt or return address.
4,another Good Collection,Redd Foxx is one of my all time Favorite Comedians. His Stand up&Party tapes are timeless to me.He can drop some tight one liners&then bring strong story telling. he was a Comedy Genius who I always listen to.His Material is timeless.
2,"One GREAT chapter on Orlando, but the rest is not so good.","Maggie Humm's book makes an important contribution on feminism and postmodernism in her wonderful chapter on ORLANDO. It is smart, insightful, and will spark great conversation in the classroom. However, the rest of her book reads like a dissertation needing revision. I taught the book in a class on sexuality and gender in film--hoping it would be effective for looking at feminism and film, as its title suggest--but I found it only marginally useful and not very readable."
4,Smart Read for a difficult topic,"There are many books which I purchased in Seminary which I later returned. This was one of the few that I kept. Ecclesiastes is one of the smallest books in the Hebrew Scriptures, but it is one of the most soulful, wisdom filled books we have. For a world today, which does not find itself with much wisdom, Encountering Ecclesiastes will help you figure out how this biblical book can speak to us today.Highly Recommend."
1,Poor quality,"This is poor quality and a waste of money - the surface is uneven, causing metering problems. Get the official Kodak gray card instead, and you'll get a set of difference sizes of high quality and usability."
4,"Excellent Value, works great!","The cards are made of thick stock and are painted with a flat, non- refletive 18 percent gray. They have basic instructions for the zone system on the back. The zip lock package is a nice bonus. Too large to carry in the camera bag, but then again small cards are not very useful when you are trying to meter from a distance."
2,Amazingly expensive for two pieces of cardboard,"Twelve dollars for two flimsy pieces of cardboard is outrageously expensive. Adorama/Delta would still make a handsome profit if they sold twelve cards for the same price. If you use your gray card frequently, as I do, it won't last long, especially if it gets wet. If you get a smudge on it, you won't be able to clean it without damaging the surface."
2,"Decent book, but needs work","This book is a good start for beginners and for teaching Reiki 1 and 2 classes. However, besides the history and background of Reiki, you also get the autobiography and self-promotion of William Rand. Some may find this a welcome addition to the book, but it may be a distraction for others. The book is not well edited and in some parts it's like reading the work of a high school kid still learing how to write. If you look past these problems, there is some useful content in the book about Reiki."
4,Good Information,I was acquainted with this book and wanted to own it. It has very good information about becoming a reiki practitioner
5,Reiki The Healing Touch,Very happy with my purchase. This book was purchased to add to my growing library and knowledge of Reiki and its healing energy.
2,Reiki: The Healing Touch,"While Rand wrote the original history for Reiki and about his own center, he writes from his intellectual self, not his heart. As a Reiki Master and a serious lightworker on the path towards ascension, I follow energy vibration through my heart center. For those who are seeking the easy steps of Reiki, there is a better book on the market that is not filled with judgment through Diane Stein. I bless him at his divine levels through his cause even though we are waiting for him to step beyond the limitations of Reiki and become his true self."
5,Brilliant force of Reiki,"I just love this book :), I have been trained from Reiki I to Reiki Master-Teacher based on the teachings of this book and Essential Reiki by Diane Stein. I however, prefer this book. William Rand who I have not met yet has taken Reiki from Dr Usui's beginnings in Japan to present day Reiki all over the world and into in the vast Universe. It includes the basic hand positions, Japanese based positions such the Raku and everything in between including jump starting your own business in Reiki. I would highly recommend it:)"
5,Reiki:The Healing Touch is used by The Reiki Energy Healing Center.,"We love this book! Lots of History, tons of Pictures and easy to follow text. The Reiki Energy Healing Center follows William Rand's style of Usui Reiki and Karuna Reiki. He lives the Reiki Way of Life. He continually is exploring Reiki and expanding it. The research he has done to get to know Mikao Usui is extraordinary. He is an inspiration!"
5,The Best,"I thought that this was one of the best books out of this series. I loved the whole Maria and Ken storyline. Also I think that it's about time that the author started portraying Elizabeth as a more normal teenager, instead of having her always being perfect and never doing a thing wrong, which was very boring, at least Elizabeth seems more like a real teenager now, instead of an adult. I wish that there was a little bit more focus on Jessica and Will though, instead of just having Jessica commenting on how cute Will is in every chapter. Also the whole Liz obession with Conner, kind of brought the book down a little, and I hope that in future books that Liz won't obsess so much on him."
4,Bad Girl,"In the book Bad Girl by Francine Parcel, Conner is in love with Elizabeth but, her mom and dad hate him! They hate him because of his car and looks also friends,so they can't date. In the end her parents get over it and let them date!The message is to be yourself and have fun with life!In the book, the author did a good job describing the waythe characters talk and also how determined they sound.The book to me was great. It was detailed and you really never know what will happen next! I look forward to reading another Francine Parcel book! They are great!-Amy Lawrence"
2,Come. On...,"Come the stars above on. This nonesense with Conner & Liz has dragged on for TWELVE books! I think Liz ought to be single for a while. Get a new plot for her, one that DOESN'T involve a guy for a change! Also unrealistic is that all year, she's let her grades slide & has been going out on school nights, then when her guidance counselor calls her to the office to discuss her grades & contacts her parents, her mom nearly has a fit. Then she forgets an appointment with her counselor & her parents get hysterical & ground her. And of course by that time, Liz is feeling rebellious & sneaks Megan into the house. Naturally her parents catch her & yell at her. Then a ludicrous & rather funny part is that she sneaks out of the house & goes to a party & gets drunk...then, of course Conner shows up to the rescue! Conner's getting rather annoying & his lame, cynical ""tough guy"" attitude is so old. Francine needs to put a close to this drawn-out plot."
2,1 charge and then it was gone.....,We were happy with this opener until the 1st time we tried to recharge it. Plugged it into the charger for 8 hours and when we tried to use it the following morning it only made it about 1 inch before giving out. Plugged it into the charger again for another 8-10 hours.....same results.The good news is customer service was courteous and is going to replace it. I am a little apprehensive about getting the same model although c.s. said they have little trouble with this model.We'll see about that.......
2,F.Y.I . Ozzy is...,"...IN Black Sabbath. At least when I saw Black Sabbath the last three times at Ozzfest. This album is not the last to feature Ozzy as vocalist. There is a two (2) cd release called, oddly enough, ""Reunion"" with Ozzy on vocals (get that, not this).For every one who says this was Ozzy's last Sabbath recording, I say whoever sang on ""Reunion"" sure sounded like a perfect Ozzy wannabe."
1,HAHAHAHAHA! 5 STARS JUST TO GET YOUR ATENTION.,"BLACK SABBATH IS ONE OF THE WORST BANDS EVER! DON'T BUY ANY ALBUM FROM THEM AT ALL! THEY ARE SO STUPID AND BORING! IT'S JUST A LOUD NOISE WITH STUPID LYRICS. BUT I THINK NIRVANA MAY BE EVEN WORSE. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR:GO ON AND BUY EXILE ON MAIN STREET FROM THE ROLLING STONES, A REAL GREAT ALBUM."
3,"5 stars for ""Over to You""","I'm ""Over to you""'s complete fan, this song stands out above the others because of the mix: classic-cool piano-ing + powerful BS-like rythm section + gospel-like ""triumphing"" organ + Ozzy's unique raging/whining voice = oppressively romantic white blues. A giant outdoor for Ozzy, however he cares of that song's power!!!Happy for the other reviewers who enjoy the whole album ..."
4,"Under-rated, but not a masterpiece","Never Say Die catches Sabbath at an awkward phase. An album had been all but done with vocalist Dave Walker and Ozzy returned. Ozzy refused to sing anything written with the other vocalist. Much of the material was written off the cuff and show the sab's ability to improv. It's a weird record, but fans should delight in it. Bill Ward's vocals on ""Swingin' the Chain"" are an unexpected high point."
3,It's Been A Long Hard Road....And It Shows,"I'm sorry to say that this album falls quite short of Black Sabbath's previous musical successes. This was a sign at the time of how their talent well was running dry, and it was time to bid farewell for the original line-up. This album does contain a few good cuts, but I'm afraid that just doesn't make up for the other poor songs. ""Never Say Die"", ""A Hard Road"", and ""Swinging The Chain"" are probably the best song on the entire album. But, as long time fans know, 'Never Say Die!' is a phrase that will fit very well with Black Sabbath. In the past two years they've recently reunited for their world tour and the Ozzfest. I'm not saying the consumer shouldn't buy this CD, but you'd be better off picking up one of the singles if at all possible. Or, keep your eyes peeled at a music store sale. That would be the time to pick this one up."
3,Good,The last Sabbath album with Ozzy on it. Never say die and Johny Blade are strong songs. Juniors eyes is another good one inspired by the death of Ozzy's Father. Bill Ward however does not live up to his last attempt at vocals producing a horrible song. A good album to get nontheless.
5,Awesome Sabbath ...very underrated,I know every Sabbath album by heart and this one is VERY GOOD!!The first 3 songs of this album are as good as Sabbath gets!Never Say Die is fast paced song that energizes you...Johnnie Blade may be the THE BEST song they ever recorded with AWESOME rowdy lyrics...Ozzie's on fire... Juniors Eyes is a chilling song with awesome changes. This is WAY underrated...right up there with Sabotage as one of their best albums. Only TRUE Black Sabbath fans are aware of this awesome album.
4,Worth the Buy,"This is not one of Black Sabbaths best albums, but is worth the buy.Its almost a repeat of the last album. It just seams like the last twoalbums with Ozzy at the helm were albums where Sabbath was trying to be something they are. However, this song has pretty good songs with catchy riffs. Some stand outs for me were never say die, johnny blade, juniors eyes, a hard road, and shock wave. These did not follow in the tradition of popular sabbath songs such as ""war pigs"" and ""children of the grave"", but they were just plain good songs. As for songs such as air dance and especially breakout got me mad. All breakout is is a jazz song that has no place in a Black Sabbath album, let alone any hard rock or metal album! Supertzar of Sabotage is way better.Over all, good album. But if you buy it, dont expect a repeat of Paranoid or Master of Reality because nothing of the sort is to be found on never say die."
3,End Of An Era,"This album is always criticised, and I can't figure out why. True, it may not be as powerful as PARANOID or MASTER OF REALITY, but this album is better then the one that preceded it, TECHNICAL ECSTACY. NEVER SAY DIE has to be Sabbath's mnost rock-oriented album. The catchy title track gets you on your feet before the bizarre ""Johnny Blade"" brings the listener into a mellow state. ""Junior's Eyes"" is my favorite song on the album. It is a catchy rocker that just gets you pumped up. ""Hard Road"" isn't bad, and ""Air Dance"" is by far the most interesting song on the album. I must note that during the making of this album, Ozzy left, and Dave Walker, from the original Fleetwood Mac, joined for a few months. They did not record, but made one live performace, and worked on ""Junior's Eyes,"" which there exists a rare recording of. Ozzy returned and got rid of all the Walker material and helped finsish the album. He would be fired from the band in early 1979, and be replaced with Ronnie James Dio."
4,Another Great Sabbath Record,"The average Sabbath ""fan"" wishes they put out 8 records that sound like Paranoid. Thankfully, the band didn't agree with you lot's musical worldview!"
2,VERY HARD TO LIKE IT !,"IT's very hard to enjoy a CD once you know that the band recorded it at their worst phase with Ozzy, and when the musicians themselves say this is a recording they want to forget about. Anyway, it has some of Iommi's genius in songwriting, and the title track is considered one of Sabath's classics."
2,The Final Curtian For Sabbath,"Yes, NEVER SAY DIE was of course the last Sabbath album to feature ozzy for 20 more years. this has got to be not the worst but the least-popular of my sabbath collection, but the song NEVER SAY DIE is the only one worth listening too on here."
5,Sabbath's best,"I'm not surprised that Sabbath fans seem to either love thisone or hate it. If your favorite BS album is Master of Reality, acollection of truly mindless, noise-rock songs, then you should probably skip this one. Never Say Die is a clever blend of heavy metal, jazz and techno with some of the best instrumental work ever produced by either bassist Geezer Butler or drummer Bill Ward. Tony Iommi's guitar work is top notch, as always. The lyrics are as powerful as those on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage, but nowhere near as dark. Shockwave, Junior's Eyes, Johnny Blade and Air Dance are the best tracks Black Sabbath ever produced. The weakest track is Over to You, although Breaking the Chain suffers a bit from Bill Ward's marginal vocals. If you like to get stoned and sit around drooling while the floor shakes from the bass response, this album is probably not for you, but if you like intelligent heavy metal (and no, that is not an oxymoron), buy this one, you'll love it."
2,"Great material, bad recording","I often wondered why this album sounded so thin and weak. I used to think my LP was a bad press, but then years later I bought the remastered import on CD. It sounded thin and weak, too. The sound quality for me makes this CD hard to listen to, even though I really like the album content. I would really like to hear this album not just remastered, but remixed as well. I doubt that would ever happen. It was cool to hear Megadeth's version of ""Never Say Die"" on the second N.I.B. album because you can get an idea of what the song really should sound like. It would be awesome to hear of other re-makes of songs on this album. My personal favorites are ""Hard Road"" (which I can listen to over and over) and ""Shock Wave"" (Cool riff at the start, and then a very complimentary riff on top of that). I would love to rate this album higher than 2 stars, but the sound quality is horrible. One of the worst mixed albums of all time."
3,better than you might think,"I chose to review this particular BS disc because I think it gets unfairly criticized. While it is true Technical Ecstasy lives up to its poor reputation, this is actually an excellent disc. Never Say Die, Junior's Eyes and A Hard Road are fine rockers. Unfortunately it's sandwiched between the pathetic Tech. Ecs. and Ozzy leaving. In fact I probably would have given it 4 stars if I didn't have to compare it to Paranoid or Master of Reality. This beats Heaven and Hell as the best BS disc after the classic first six. Buy it!"
1,"You Wanna Say ""Never Say This One Will Live!""","My God, this is awful! If Ozzy never before sounded like the talentless drug-addict he used to be, he sure did on this one! How could a band that is so good produce such garbage? It boggles my mind. Ozzy sings like he doesn't care if people DO say ""Die."""
1,Worst Album Ever,"Not just Sabbath, I mean ANY album !What a piece of garbage. Not even worth downloading from Kaaza. I only hope the used CD shop will give me $2 for it"
2,Shark Sandwich,"Ok, so its not as bad as Technical Exctasy or Vol 4. but it still blows, overall. The title track has always been a favorite, and I find some interesting moments with ""Swinging the Chain"" sung by Ward, and ""Air Dance"". Hard Road fittingly has the whole band singing as sort of bon voyage, but the Greatestness of Sabbath died after Sabotage. I wish the original singer on this album got his shot. Ozzy was the band's worst singer, though the one that defined them.My greatest fear right now, is that the band will stop suing one another and reunite, but if they do, it should be with the understanding that Ozzy will sing Digital B*tch from Born Again. That would be some justice. Dio is dead and so is Black Sabbath."
2,"2,5 stars",Only Never say die and Juniors eyes worth a good rate. The other songs are really terrible. One of their worst albums in their entire career. Thaks God Ozzy made his own band. Guys dont waste your time here -> buy the first albums till sabotage and your ok with the Black sabbath.
3,"Not for the unitiated, ***** first 4 tracks ** for the rest","Seriously, Sabbath should have released this as an EP and it would have been a memorable end to the Ozzy era. The first four songs in the record may not be classic Sabbath, but I'll be damned if they are not awesome tunes. Any band at that time would have killed for such killer tracks as ""Never Say Die"", the thundering ""Johnny Blade"", the classic ""Junior's Eyes"" and the catchy and uplifting ""Hard Road"".If you are already into Sabbath, but have not listened this record, buy it only for the first 4 tracks. Keep that in mind and you will not be dissapointed. If you happen to love the rest of the CD, good for you!"
2,Weakest Black Sabbath album,"Although there are a few great moments on ""Never Say Die"", there is no doubt in my mind that it's the weakest album that Black Sabbath have ever released. Not one song can pretend to be among the band's best. Even what may be the finest track, 'Junior's Eyes', isn't particularly memorable. It just gets lost amidst all of the mediocre material. Ozzy is particularly unimpressive, and even Tony Iommi seems uninspired. The original US cd release sounds lousy so avoid that one. ""Never Say Die"" is better-sounding on the UK remaster, and the notes are interesting as with all of the remasters. The best-sounding version of ""Never Say Die"" is the 1993 cd (Spectrum 550 131- 2) from the Netherlands. This one may be hard to find, but for some reason it sounds splendid. For an album as inherently weak as ""Never Say Die"" is by Sabbath standards, it helps a lot to hear a good version of it, believe me."
1,Should've said die!,"Awful! The final Sabbath album with Ozzy is by far the worst, with only one good track, ""Junior's Eyes"", on the entire CD. The title track is terribly poppy, and the CD finally collapses into a mess of jazz. For the completist only. Otherwise, skip this one and move on to ""Heaven and Hell"" or, if you're an Ozzy fan, ""Blizzard of Oz""."
2,Title Track Rocks but not much else,"I love the Title Track but I think that the rest of the CD is plain and has no punch. I might have overlooked one or two other songs that are decent on this CD but really, the only reason to buy this CD would be for ""Never Say Die"""
1,"Very boring, far from their best","I am sort of going through a revision of BS albums, that I had on tapes and/or vynil long time ago. This one is not among my favorites. There is just too much Ozzy here, and not enough of everybody else. The title track is unremarkable; then the music goes up a bit on tracks 2 and 3, but then it slows down, and until the last track the sound is as boring as if it's Greatful Dead or something. The only thing that's cool about this album is its cover. I am at complete loss, why in most shops this CD is sold for higher price than other BS stuff."
3,Marginal Improvement over Techinical Ecstasy,"Let's face it, Techinical Ecstasy sucked big time. This time Sabbath comes back with a better album. Unfortunately, by now Ozzy doesn't care all that much and the songs are not Sabbath sounding. Junior's Eyes,Johnny Blade, and the title track are good songs, but not classic Sabbath songs. This album is not that bad but pares in comparsion to the early Sabbath gems."
3,Underrated.,"Never Say Die is one of their best songs ever. The album's a slight improvement over their previous, Technical Ecstasy. There's more guitar and less synthesizer, the band shows some improvement which would show all the way on Heaven and Hell. I don't get all the bad reviews, it isn't as dark but that doesn't make it bad. It's also their last album with Ozzy before he went solo and is replaced with Ronnie James Dio."
4,Lives up to the Album Title,"Never Say Die (1978) marked the end of the Ozzy era of Black Sabbath. The band would boldly move forward and record with Ronnie James Dio and produce a fine first album with him (Heaven and Hell). When listening to this album, however, one can clearly see (and hear) the cracks in the machine. However, this album isn't without some very good songs. My personal favorite is Junior's Eyes, which has a nifty guitar solo in the middle and is raw heavy metal at its finest. I also like Over to You, which has a similar sound. Air Dance is an unusual number, and I can remember my nephew rolling around in the snow on a cold night while listening to this one (long story). I've always wondered how and why Iommi went with a most unusual guitar sound with this album. It almost sounds garage-like. Still, it's unique, and overall I think the album works. It's certainly not vintage Sabbath, but can hold its own nevertheless."
5,Excellent fuision of many different types of music,"Even though it's supposed to be an album of desert guitars(middle east type), nonetheless, it is one of the best guitar albums i've heard in a long time. Strunz & Farah use combination of jazz, soft jazz, arabic belly dance, persian sufi music, latin pop etc. If you want to titillate your senses when listening music, this is it. Enjoy"
5,Desert Guitars is excellent,I bought over a dozen CD's from Amazon and immediately loaded them on my iPod and have been playing them often. Excellent musician and the recordings are clear and precise.
4,body care,Great product even though my personal preference is Chamomile & Wildflowers. Seller very prompt with shipping and would recommend Amazon for whatever your needs
1,It is not working. The technical suport is very slow and useless,"I bought a Canon DC40 digital camcorder. The software can't capture the video, a pop up message shows that I need to buy MyDVD 9. So I bought one. It is not working at all in my computer. I contacted Roxio support on their website, the Live Chat doesn't work, I could only open a ticket, leave a message. It takes 24 hours or longer to get the response. But I tried two solutions, they are not working. I opened the third ticket but didn't get any response in 10 days. I decided to return back to Amazon."
1,MyDVD 9 is a huge step backwards,"I used to happily use MYDVD versions 5 and 6 but recently I purchased version 9. It is a huge disappointment. The interface is completely non-intuitive, and it no longer uses standard Windows file open menus and list boxes. It is extremely slow and full of bugs. Worse, the MBA financial engineers at Roxio have removed features so that they can charge extra for them. After five hours of frustration I removed MYDVD 9 from my system. Technical support was non existent. This is the worst software I can remember using in more than 20 years."
1,The Clunkiest!,"Full of glitches, slow as molasses, and suffering from program bloat and creeping featurism. NFG!"
3,cool music's hopes not met..,"Hard to put a finger on it. LOVE the music - Villa-Lobos is ALWAYS exciting (even his Quartets are wild and fresh), and the Bachianas Basilieras is a magical score. Tilson Thomas attends to the colors, but there's something lackluster about the whole performance. Something missing in the conducting. I find myself NOT in a repeat play mode with this recording! Fleming parades an overstuffed voice in the doleful #5, why is she lately so unnecessary??? Gosh, I'd so like to like her art, but it seems she's lost and passing through some weird phase vocally. Hope it doesnt last. The performances on this recording have too much pretense around them, & it's a real negative. These folks are young and gifted, maybe I'm a crank... but there's no reason not to always make music with integrity, is there? On Joan Baez' first or second album she recorded the No.5.. I'd really like to hear that recording again."
3,Was it really necessary?,"As a whole, Thomas does good with this music. Villalobos is always exciting to hear, and his extraordinary fusion of Brasilian folk music with that of Bach mixed with resounding rhytms is well worthy of another recording and version.But Fleming is cheating. She sings some strange lines added from her own harvest in the second part of the Aria that the author didn't write. Besides she is accompanied not by the eight cellos (according to the composer's original score)but by the orchestra. That is cheating!!I, too, love her voice, but, as another reviewer put it, my ""love"" is not inconditional. Why is she so necessary lately? Her repertoire is full enough of miscastings. And also, the face so often wrong, as with her Villalobos."
2,Marginal,"I bought this as an expriment for a satellite receiver setup. It improved the signal, but not by much."
4,In response to previous rating.........,"This CD IS the same as the original UK version. ""Your Generation"" was only ever a single in the UK."
3,Great tracks but incomplete,"This is a rather odd release of the Generation X's debut album, as several tracks have been removed, but all is not lost. You see, the U.K. version of the Debut album differred from the U.S. release. The U.S. release was missing songs like Too Personal, Invisible man, and Listen which are all great, classic Generation-X tunes. Instead, the U.S. release had replacement songs like Gimme some truth and Wild Dub. But this album is missing songs like Promises Promises, Kleenex, and Wild Youth. So if you have the U.S. release of this album you might consider picking this up for the extra tracks, however, I recommend you pick up the Anthology album which is about as complete a Gen-x collection as you could hope for. Also, the BBC Live album is great."
1,Parrot Toys and play areas,If your a beginner to toys and playareas this will be hard to go by; there are NO pictures.
5,Very fun and practical!!,"These authors KNOW PARROTS! This book is jammed with creative ideas for delightful (and appropriate) parrot toys. Its ""how-to"" instructions, information about various species, and insights into the purpose of toys (such as fulfilling a parrot's need to chew, preen, and manipulate) make it a wonderful resource. It has something for every budget and every pet bird. After following its explicit step-by-step instructions for making a parrot ""adventure station"" (materials about $30), I have something far more usable and versatile than many of the trees that cost hundreds. (All my Amazon knows is life has become a LOT more fun!)"
3,Things you would never have thought to use,"The book is easy to read, and the anecdotes are full of humor. The author is clearly a person who cares for her parrots. From the cover, one would expect to find photos inside, but there are none. The lack of photos is a negative point. The what-to-buy lists are useful, and there are many objects and 'things' that can be found around the house that make amazing parrot-toys, all for free! The book is full of ideas and hints, and every time I go to the shops now, my eye seems to catch something that would be great for Bob (my African Grey). Baby toys are very expensive, and made of a very hard plastic that Bob will explore once, but then discard for one of his more 'manageable' rubber toys that I made from hints in the book. A useful and worthwhile book for parrot-owners, but a book that a number of parrot-friends can share."
5,Excellent Book!,This book is perfect. I was looking for some very specifics on the title topics and it has them all. Thanks for a great book and fast shipment.
5,Great Book on Bird Toys & Activity Sets,"As a crafty person who just rescued an umbrella cockatoo from an abusive household, I am very, very pleased with this book. I don't have a lot of money to be throwing around to buy toys, but I do have a bunch of PVC pipe from a project some years ago and am putting it to good use thanks to this book. Great buy!"
5,parrot-toys and play areas,great book if you want to save lots of money easy to read and make stuff gives cost to make also
2,Parrots Toys,Very disappointed; not pictures not illustrated instructions on how to make anything. Would not recommend.
3,Parrot toy and Play areas,"I've read the entire book, and it has so much helpful information on using simple items found around the house, or that are inexpensive to purchace. I can't wait to make the play stand for my birds."
5,Great for improving your birds life!!,"This book categorises parrot personalities and describes 11 types of toys that will suit their individual traits. It then offers ideas for safely making these toys.My birds seem to be so much happier having a variety of toys that are designed specifically for their needs.My only gripe is the book provides diagrams for making bird gyms etc, but doesn't give any pictures or diagrams for the home-made toys."
4,My rabbit liked the bedding.,"This bedding worked pretty well for my rabbit. It's very soft, and you get a very large amount to use. My only complaint is that it can be difficult to vacuum out of your carpet depending how thick it is, so be careful!"
2,Not thrilled with this bedding,"I won a sample pack of this bedding that was just enough to cover my degu's 10 gallon tank. It was very staticky and started to stick to my degu's fur. Then when they dug in the corners to hide their treats they were able to dig through it so fast they started just moving the medding around the cage - pushing it all to one side then the other. This left a lot of exposed glass at the bottom. In the spots where there was bedding it did a fantastic job absorbing moisture.I'd only buy this for a dig box for them - never again for bedding. Mixing it with other bedings might work but fir the price I wouldn't buy again. Use Carefresh (CareFresh Pet Bedding/Litter) or a paper bedding with baking soda (PETCO Small Animal Paper Bedding with Baking Soda, 14 liters, Color:Blue) instead."
3,Great bag but BEWARE,"I loved this bag when I bought it but during a recent airline trip the bag was checked and loaded onto the plane in the pouring rain. Even though the zippers were closed tightly, the rain leaked through the bag and everything inside was soaked. On the way home, the bag was placed on the ground in a small puddle and the same thing happened. Water leaked into the bag and soaked everything on the bottom. These are great bags if the weather is good but do beware if you plan to use it in bad weather or check it on the airlines where you have no control over where it is placed. They are not waterproof. The advertisements say ""water resistent"" and I am not sure what that means but my bag certainly did not resist the rain. Our other bags that were handled in the same manner were all dry inside."
4,Love it,I bought a bag pack last year and now I have the red duffle bag to match. I'm glad I caught this bag on sale because Kipling is not cheap.
3,No lock,"hi,I was so happy when I received the Kipling Anatomy 24"" Medium Duffel (Espresso)but there was a problem.A lock for the bag was not sent with it. So I wonder why?"
3,Fun for the office,Everyone that walks into my office finds the need to pick it up and squeeze the #$%^& out of it.
4,Kool,"Works great, no problem with purchase or seller, delivered in a timely fashion, it's fun to play with, thank you"
2,Bugged about Bug Out Bob,Remembered this toy as a kid. There was a more detailed body at that time. Was a little disappointed in its appearance. The rubber looked like it had been in the trash with a black smuggy appearance. Looks like it needs to be washed. Got it as a stress-reliever joke. Guess the joke is on me.
5,Bug Out Bob for generations to come...,"When my tween-nephew moved out of state, he was an unhappy transplant and a bit stressed out. He specifically requested Bug-Out Bob, but we couldn't find him anywhere - not in toy shops, novelty shops, etc. (which added to the stress!) So I turned to Amazon and Toysmith and there he was. Fortunately, my nephew's back - but Bug Out Bob was a fine companion through his journey - I highly recommend this durable icon for all ages!!"
2,Not what I was expecting.....,"I was expecting this toy to be a more gratifying squishy, and not just filled with air. However, I don't believe there was any false advertising or anything like that, it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be."
5,Hot Hot Hot,One of four books in this series. Another great book by this author hot sex and hot men!
5,Amazing series!!!!!,"This is the second in the Men of August series.(If you haven't read Marley's choice start there first.)I wasn't sure when I first read the overview of the series but, after the recommendation of a few friends I decided to give the series a try. There are some of the steamiest scenes I have ever read in a book. The story really grips you and leaves you yearning for the next book. I highly recommend the series to anyone. These books make 50 shades look a little muted. I am definitely a fan of both book series but this series is much steamier. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
1,do not read,"this is very degrading these ""men"" need to see a therapist. no woman would stay with a man after he just screwed his brothers girlfriend and came to her house to shower then tells her he loves her then sleeps with her!! this series is a no go"
1,Grotesque!,"Need I say more. This series is, literally, nothing but trash! Brothers, really, yuck! I am all in for fun, but being coerced into having sex with not just the guy I love, but his brothers, too? Could I be such a moron? There isn't enough steamy anything to make this series worthwhile. I deleted it off of my Kindle. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Sarah's Seduction Book 2 of series,"I read this book, because I always feel like if there is a series, I should forge ahead and hope for the best. We find out more in this book about the abuses the brothers suffered at their fathers will and the will of his ""friend"". Atrocious as those abuses were, it still seems odd to me that the brothers can only show their love for each other by sharing their women.These men are hot and dominant and I enjoy that, but couldn't the sharing of their women just have been a kink that they are into instead of a healing mechanism for their pain?Again, if you are reading this to enjoy the erotica, then you will enjoy it. This book is Brock's story and he is pretty hot and is not afraid to articulate what he wants from his woman.Lora Leigh knows how to write those scenes well - I give this an average review."
1,Read 1/2,"I read all of Marley's book and 1/2 of Sarah's book. I could not stand anymore. There is no woman in their right mind who would be led around by such a heavy hand. I would call the cops and have these men arrested. The erotica is great but if you can not stand any of the characters then it is pretty hard to read the sex scenes. I have LOVED, LOVED, LOVED most of Lora Leigh's writing. But this series SUCKS!!!!"
4,A sizzling read,Sizzling & steamy read. The only reason it's not a 5 is that the character Sarahs' hesitancy. It drags out too long. then picks up and keeps you hooked.
5,If your looking for a Menage...,"This is the second story in the Men of August series. This is about Brock and Sarah. This one to me was a little bit more believable at how much Sarah wanted Brock, but not her brothers. In the end it was pretty much if you want me, you have to have my brothers to. I know being in a relationship is about give and take, but man that is a biggy. I did like this one the best out of all, Sarah seemed to have a little bit more of a back bone than the others. Yes it continues with creepy bad guys, and yes she gives in for her man to be with his brothers, but I think Ms. Leigh also shows a side to these ladies how they deep down want to experiment with their own sexuality and try this. Over all hot and sexy, and really that is why we buy an erotic book. Keep the fan on high!!!"
1,just lame,"I am almost embarrassed to admit to reading this, not because the content (romantica wise) but because it was so badly done. I read the author's breed series and found it interesting, but this just did not compare. The main premiss used to legitimate the menage story-line was retarded. The brothers were traumatized and now ""have"" to have group sex and swap partners, really? come on.The bad guy is lame, not scary just your typical ""boogyman"" bad guy. The female protagonist is a doormat, and the male protagonist is honestly creepy in the way he insists that she has to have sex with his brothers.Don't waste your time or money."
5,Slow Death,"I WAS SURPRISED AND ENTERTAINED WITH HIS EXPRESSION AND WRITING SKILLS.HE HAS TAKEN THE TIME TO DEVELOP THE CHARACTERS INVOLVED AND PRESENTED THE STORY FROM A POINT OF VIEW THAT SHOULD BE INSPIRATIONAL TO READERS OF ALL AGES.I BELIEVE EVERY TEENAGER COULD IDENTIFY WITH THE PRESURES THAT SURROUNDS THE MAIN CHARACTER IN ""SLOW DEATH"".MY ONLY CONCERN IS THE TITLE OF THE BOOK. I DO NOT THINK IT REFLECTS THE REAL MEANING AND INTENTION OF THE WRITER.I HAVE RATED THIS A 5 ON THE SCALE (...) BECAUSE I TOTALY ENJOYED THE STORY AND THE ART OF THE STORY-TELLING"
2,Difficult book to read,"Needed for my daughter's college class. Bought here used and saved a lot of money, so that was great. Book was in good condition as described. But it is very, very difficult to understand, and you can't always find the answers to the end of chapter questions."
5,Powerful Prayer,"For every reader who's ever wanted to dig deeper into prayer; for every reader who wanted to learn about the huge Christian movement going on in Europe in recent years; for every reader who wants to grow closer to God through prayer, this book is for you.I highly recommend it to any and every one. As a person who recently discovered the true meaning of prayer and how powerful it really is, I know that people can learn so much about themselves and God and the purpose of their lives through prayer. For those struggling with this issue or just want to learn more about real, 24/7 prayer and the Europeans behind the recent movement, this book is worth every penny."
5,Challenged... you will be.,"Red Moon Rising is a fantastic book, I was drawn into the adventure from page one and could not put the book down. I am left excited by God and hungry to catch up with what the spirit is doing in this generation."
5,Red Moon Rising: How 24-7 Prayer is Awakening a Generation,Excellent Read...couldn't put it down. Received it on time and in excellent condition. Thank you Amazon!
5,Very Moving,"It was great to see how the lord is working all over the world. The idea of 24/7 prayer is wonderful, I read this book in 2 days I could not put it down, I am going to start a prayer room in my home church."
1,Doesn't stay down!!,I bought this to replace our aging toaster that was fine except too small for things like bagels and could only toast 2 slices at a time. I figured this looked like a good deal and I trusted the cuisinart brand name. From the first time we used it the toaster activation slide wouldn't stay down. We would have to push it down 3-4 times at least before it would stay down. Many times it wouldn't even work so we would give up. I ended up having to take the toaster apart myself and sand the carbon buildup off of the contacts so it would work at all! When the toaster was gracious enough to work it would generally burn one side of the toast and undercook the other. This is a prime example of trying to make something simple too complicated and then not being able to perform the function it was designed for in the first place. I guess I've learned that I don't care how many microchips and settings my toaster has if it won't even stay down!
4,Great toaster and great value!,"I was a little skeptical of factory reconditioned, but this toaster was in ""brand new"" condition. We've had it about a month and so far it works great. Nice design and excellent value."
1,Can you be any slower?,I've had this model (purchased new) for around 3 years and have hated it!!! Toasting two slices of bread takes about 5-7 minutes which is ridiculous.Finally decided to replace it because this unit just is really annoying.
1,Worst Customer Service & Warranty,"Well, my toaster was defective.Since it was still under warranty, i called their customer service at 1-800-726-0190After 30 minutes of holding,A CSR picked up the phone and say ""We are very busy, can I put you on hold?""I replied, ""I've already beeen on hold for 30 minutes"".She replied ""Well, there are many people ahead of you, I have to put you on hold.""It's not like I have a choice, so I said fine.Then I hold another 30 minutes, then I finally get to talk to another CSR about my problem.After speaking to them, I realize the warranty did not cover shipping, not even one way. They want me to send the defective item back at my cost PLUS a $10 check to cover the shipping for them to ship it back to me. Hmmm, I bought this toaster for $20, and why would I want to spend $20 on shipping?"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I bought this toaster after Consumer Reports rated it a ""Best Buy."" At about $60, it was the most expensive I'd ever purchased, but I thought it should probably be worth it with all its features. What a huge disappointment! The selection buttons seem to be for decorative purpose only. Choose defrost - full power. Choose bagel - full power on both sides (I called Cusinart support and the rep checked with his supervisor and came back to tell me that ""yeah, the bagel feature doesn't really change anything."" Add to this that it was the slowest toaster I'd ever had and I realized I'd made a bad buy.I gave the toaster to a charity (should I be embarrassed?) and bought one from Black & Decker for half the price. The B&D; toaster does everything that the Cuisinart doesn't - and much more quickly."
3,"Sorry, not for bagel biters","Bought a new one.While it toasts bread acceptably well, the options and shade settings do not allow the degree of control necessary to toast frozen bagels (why anyone would toast fresh bagels baffles me).No amount of experimentation with the bagel setting, defrost, and varying shades would get it to come out right. In order to toast frozen bagels it's necessary to make 2 attempts.Is this nitpicking? Well yes, but for the price (new) I'd expect this device to toast, butter and serve them too!I wish I purchased the one with a simple knob."
1,Skip this one-it doesn't toast well,"Google this model and see all the ""reconditions""! Uneven toasting, burned edges and white middles. I bought this model and 1 year later it shuts itself off and sparks. Amazon should not be selling these anymore."
2,Warning: This toaster is not worth it....,"I bought this new not reconditioned, and yes it does toast, but is really not user freindly. The biggest complaint I have is every time you unplug it or hit cancel the memory on your selected toasting darkness resets. Unfortunately it resets to the darkest, so the next time you use it if you don't check it burns your item."
1,Half burnt toast,"I spent a lot of time deciding on a new toaster and was very excited about this one, especially the prospect of toasting 4 pieces of bread at a time! A real time saver in our family as we were still using (and still are as fate would have it) a two slice toaster. So on the day it arrived, I cheered! excitedly unwrapped the package, set up the new ""super"" toaster and popped in my first 4 pieces of bread! My husband, the humorist, walks by as I proudly reached in to pull out the toast and asked, ""Did you pay extra to have it only toast on 3 of 4 sides?"" What a disappointment......I guess we will stick with the two slice reliable $9.95 toaster in our house."
2,Toaster Has Uneven Performance,"I bought the new version of this toaster about six months ago and I have been disappointed in its performance. The toaster gives very uneven results, often almost burning one side of a slice of bread while leaving the other side barely toasted. The adjustments to allow different settings do not seem to correspond to the results -- the toaster continues to almost burn one side of the bread even at lower settings. One advantage of this toaster is that there is enough space for larger items such as bagels."
1,High Price Low Performance,"Toasts bottom of slice - top remains pale. Returned it and received another. Did the same thing, if set toaster for longer period - bottom of slice burnt - top toasted o. k. Not what I expect from a cuisinart product or any toaster."
1,Cuisinart is not testing these toasters...,"I saw many good reviews for this toaster and a few bad ones too. I took my chances and ordered one anyway.Cuisinart is not testing these toasters. It took 10 seconds for me to see that the inner elements are not heating up. They are cleaning them, possibly changing the elements, and shipping them. My guess is that it is just cheaper not to test them. Big mistake. It's harder to win back customers than to keep them."
2,barely functional but not reliable,"My first Cuisinart 4-slice toaster developed a dangerous problem after the 3-month warantee period: it started heating when not turned on, and made strange clicking sounds. It never had toasted very well, and only toasted lightly on the darkest setting. To their great credit, Cuisinart replaced the toaster for the shipping cost alone (although it took 3 months). The replacement toaster also toasts very lightly, very slowly, but at least it's not an immediate fire hazard."
2,"Beware of reconditioned items,","I returned this toaster because it was rusted, dirty, and scratched. Be VERY cautious when buying ""Reconditioned"" items!"
3,Reconditioned Toaster not reconditioned,"I'm sure that the toaster was returned because the 'shade' indicator stayed on all the time. That's what it is doing now. I think the manufacturer just put it in another box without repairing that. It's not worth paying the shipping costs to the manufacturer to have them fix it, but it was not reconditioned to 'new' as they indicated."
2,"OK electronics, junky case","The good: range is ok, it's loud enough to hear.The ok: no volume control, and the sound is a little too loud for the amplifier, so the sound is slightly distorted (like your stereo turned up too loud).The bad: the case for the transmitter comes in two pieces that didn't fit together. After I took a knife and shaved off some of the plastic, I could get the front to clip onto the back, but it's still not a very solid fit and I worry about it falling off. Meanwhile, the included screws are apparently made out of butter; using an electric screwdriver, I stripped the head of the first one so badly I had to use pliers to remove it, and then using a normal screwdriver that fit perfectly and being very careful, I was still barely able to get the other screws in."
1,Arrived DOA,This product seems to have quality control issues since mine was DOA. I'm not the only one who's reported this. Thank God for Amazon's no hassle return policy!
2,Not Reliable,"When it works, the sound and light all good.A new Battery died in a week then Transmitter died shortly."
4,Great bell,"We've had this bell at home for a long time, and it works great I have no complaints about it, the fact that it is wireless is so convenient. The only detail is that the bell is really loud, so you might consider placing it somewhere where the noise won't bother you as much."
5,Great simple doorbell,"This is a great, simple and easy-to-hear doorbell with three different chimes to it. I personally stuck to the simple ""ding"" since the entire Westminster might be a bit cheesegratery on the nerves, and it works just fine. Using it in a second floor apartment; the receiver is mounted outside under an awning, so I can't say much for its ruggedness, but it survives the cold just fine.Five stars because I lost the manual pretty early after my purchase and decided to change jumpers; a quick visit to the Sunnybell site and a short email to them later, I was the proud owner of a scanned copy the very same day. Now that's great support!"
1,"Main unit marginal, remote doorbell worthless","The main unit is barely adequate, heavy and unattractive.But the remote doorbell is completely useless, making the whole package a bad buy. Fragile and not well sealed against the weather, I had to mount it inside the storm door to protect it. But it fell to pieces and needed to be picked up off the ground several times. The battery didn't fit snugly in the battery (laugh to call it that) holder, tape was used to keep the thing together. Finally the main unit fell on the ground and a visitor stepped on it, thank god.Don't waste your money."
