2,Que lastima pudo ser un buen clasico y lo desperdiciaron,"Es una lastima que un grupo con excelente trayectoria haya desperdiciado la oportunidad de convertir este album en un clasico. No aportan nada nuevo ""Te solte la rienda"" unicamente es para mariachi y ""Se me olvido otra vez"" es para Juan Gabriel. Es increible que con Alex, el mejor percusionista de México, Maná no haya intentado algun acustico de nivel. Creo que los grupos mexicanos todavia tienen que aprehender a aprovechar vitrinas tan importantes como los proyectos unplugged. (v.gr. Nirvana, Erick Clapton).Unicamente valen la pena dos canciones En el muelle de San Blas y Perdido en un barco."
5,"mana mtv unplugged, why its so good","mana mtv unplugged is a great album. Mana once again give you the best they have. This time, they give you they're greatest hits, and play the songs on an acoustic guitar. It gives you a sense of what music is like without all the modern sound effects"
5,Mana is the best band in the world.,"The worlds greatist band has realy out done themselves with this album. In this one you get true sense of the bands great music talent, not that you can't tell it in there other albums, it's just that you can hear it on this album as classic Mana songs are brought to life in ways that are'nt heard on there orignal cd's. After hearing this album you will more then likly become a Mana fan if you already are'nt one and will also want to buy there other albums, which I highly recommened."
2,Ain't worth it.,"I'de say about 30-40% of the tracks are good. The rest simply aren't worth the time it takes to listen to them. Far too much cheese, not enough consistancy and quality music.I recommend buying tracks individually rather then this entire collection."
2,Marillion's most overrated album,"Misplaced Childhood is a good album, but it is far from Marillion's best. While there's some good songs (Kayleigh, CHildhoods End, White Feather), too many of the tracks are just filler, which is a bad thing when the album is only 40 some minutes! If you want the hear Marillion at their finest, check out Clutching at Straws."
2,I give it two stars with my heart bleeding...,""" Misplaced Childhood "" is an amazing album. It's a concept album, full of great songs, one mended into the other. There is the master-piece ""Kayleigh"" among others. But, when someone says that Marillion is very much like Genesis, forget about it: Marillion is Genesis !!! The difference is that Marillion sounds more ""fresh"", due mainly to the evolution in the recording facilities and equipments. Well, that's it."
1,tiresome,"These stories as a collection, whilst well written, are quite long and not what you would call light quick reading. As a shared reading experience with my partner it was quite cumbersome."
2,SOFT TOYS TO SEW,"we would like to buy the lot of books for soft toys making design our address saral typing Lily chowk, Raipur (M.P.) India. Plese arrange to sent the books and condition for payment. suggest How to send the payment."
4,Ultramax Large Water Pitcher By Brita,"This is a great Brita Water Dispenser!I am lucky because my refrigerator has a slide out shelf, Making it easy to access and fill my Brita Ultramax Dispenser!I love the large capacity, and always having Ice Cold Great Tasting Water is a real plus!"
3,Eh....,"I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago in an effort to ""Go Green"" and eliminate my use of plastic water bottles. While this has done the trick, the downside is that the spigot began to leak within a couple of days. I returned it and now my second one is doing the same thing at a much faster rate. I wish I would have read these reviews before making the purchase..."
1,Leaks,"I bought this unit and it worked great for a week or so and now it leaks at the water dispenser fitting. I tried to tighten the fitting but it still leaks. So if you want water all over your refrigerator or your counter tops buy this! Not sure if I kept the box so I may be stuck with this, really sucks."
3,just don't care for the taste,"While my husband says he likes it, I just can't seem to get past the taste of the Brita; I can still taste the ""tap"" or chemical part of the water. My parents lived in a city where the water was VERY bad, and they could not use it either - it just didn't take away the bad taste. We finally just bought a Reverse Osmosis system for our kitchen sink and I can't say how glad I am to be giving up the Brita! YUCK! I'm giving it 3 stars only because it's cheap & will help SOME with poor taste of the water but in my opinion, it doesn't do the job well enough."
5,Well made. Very convenient to use.,The first shipment was broken and Amazon replaced it immediately.The transaction was a breeze!
5,My old faithful,I also have one of the older models and have loved it for about 10 years...even the cats won't drink tap water anymore! I have purchased several for friends and family. I put it in the dishwasher about once a month and have had only sporadic problems with mold. It will definitely get you to drink more water.
4,big but not as big....,"I bought this to replace an existing large britta container that started to leak. This once isn't as big as the previous one, we seem to be refilling it more frequently, but all in all it is very good."
2,it leaks!,I bought the ultramax simply because of the size. From day one the spigot has leaked. I tried taking it off and putting it back on being careful not to strip the threads. Still leaks to the point of water all over the refridgerator.I think i will throw it away.
3,it leaks!!,"So, all was well with my new Brita, until we started noticing water on the counter. It leaks from the spout at a pretty constant drip. I'm calling Brita about their warrantee today. Hopefully they've improved the design. I bought this item BRAND NEW less than a month ago. Annoyed."
3,Large footprint and tough to clean,"It's a whopper, and you'll need a very large fridge or countertop.My only gripe is, with bad texas water, residue builds up in the plastic fitting around the spout, and it takes a pretty tricky maneuver to clean it out. Like all brita's, excessively scratch prone."
1,!!!!! BEFORE BUYING THIS - READ THIS !!!!!,"I really should've done some research before buying this.All of the reviews are 100% correct. There is considerable mold growing under the water dispenser area, despite diligent washing 2-3x per week. God knows this water isn't healthy!In addition, water leaks under the main water dispenser area, so this is a huge negativeLastly, there are areas where the water doesn't drain."
1,The darn thing leaks,"I bought this from Kmart 3 weeks ago, and it was leaking the very first day. Emptied it and found the plastic screw loose. Tightened it as much as reasonably possible. Guess what? It leaks, less, but it leaks. Looking for my receipt so I can take it back and exchange it for something that won't pour water all over my fridge."
1,DANGEROUS FILTER - Green Algae like buildup every 10 days,This BRITA model is potentially DANGEROUS TO HEALTH. Green Algae like substance builds up every 10 days or so despite thorough cleaning.
4,Great Dispenser!,"The 35530 is an ideal size for a water dispenser and holds about a gallon of water, which is nice compared to standard Brita pitchers. The box height is not too tall so it fits perfectly on counters and in the fridge. The box has handles on both sides which makes it easy to carry or yank forward to have the spout overhang the counter to easily poor a glass.My one issue is that the water fill pan is not easily removed. In an standard pitcher its easy to remove the pan to toss a few lemon slices into the filtered water - not so with this version. I should mention however that i've just gotten this, so maybe i just haven't found the right method to remove it yet..."
3,brita could be betta,"pros- large size. I drink a lot of water daily, about ten cups, so this is a fantastic upgrade from my pitcher. also convenient to keep near where I make tea/ coffee.cons- no way to open it and clean it. it leaks a small amount, but I am afraid it will get worse as time goes on.also, I did not receive the item I ordered. instead of having a digital filter reader, it just has a sticker.I am returning the product to target and hopefully they will just exchange it for the correct item that I ordered, and also hopefully it will not leak."
1,It leaks.,The first one I received was cracked. The replacement leaks from the on/off valve. What a sorry product!
3,"Good, could be better","The water is clean, tastes good, etc... But the tap dispenses the water with force only when it is full. As the container goes below the half-line, the water pressure from the tap becomes less and by the time it gets to a quarter tank, you need to tilt it forward to get the water out. I know I am nit-picking, but hey, I'm just giving an honest review."
2,Mold!,I bought this solid Brita Dispenser a year ago and had no problems with leaking. I also would have given it 5 five stars until I discovered mold forming in the bottom of the tank yesterday. I'm such a fan of Brita and will be purchasing this product again once they design this dispenser so it can be taken apart to be cleaned properly.
3,"Works, but leaks","I just got this a couple of days ago - and I like it except that it leaks where the spout attaches to the unit. It is not a huge amount, but the counter has a wet spot within a few minutes. I am trying to resolve it myself, but may be returning it. Am a bit disappointed, because my mom has an older model that she loves and has had for years.Am updating my review because my husband was able to resolve the leak - and that is the only negative I had, so I am pleased - it filters the water quickly and it has a great taste (our water isn't terrible to begin with, but has a definite hint of clorine odor when unfiltered)."
1,"Poor design, MOLD!!!",You cannot take this thing apart to clean it properly. As a result =mold. The end.
4,My views on the Ultra Max,"This is an excellant water filter. All Brita products perform outstanding.There are 2 drawbacks to this item.1) The ""meter"" on it automatically counts down letting you know when to change the filter. It assumes you drink the suggested amount of water daily. So if you don't the meter expires before the filter does.2) It is sort of bulky to fill up in the sink. For my personal use I probably should have bought the pitcher unit. This unit is fine, I just hate taking it out of the fridge to fill up.All in all not a bad unit. It performs excellant, it's just the features that are the drawbacks."
2,Leaks and Access issues,"This unit leaks at the valve assembly. Also, it does not fit in our new frig. Planning on replacing with a different model."
1,It is keep leaking,"I have used this about three weeks and I realized that it cannot make no leaking.I have tried to fix it with turning the water lever area. Then, it looks like fine, however, after one week, it make leaking again"
3,so..so,i think so..sobecause um...... easy but water taste was not good..just used cook.when i want water i didnt eat this water.
1,"Moldy, dirty and leaky...","So, I have to agree with all the others who said it leaks and it grows mold.... because it definitely does. But also I returned this product 3 times because of it's leakiness and also one of them was cracked upon purchase. I contacted Brita through e-mail and got NO RESPONSE. Not only does it grow mold on the outside of the spigot around the o ring where you can see it, but also on the inside where you can't. G.R.O.S.S. This can be cleaned with a Q-Tip as well as the outside, not as easy to clean the mess it leaves all over the fridge though... I will never purchase a Brita product again."
1,The filter is as good as a Pur,"I bought this to replace the pur filter that I broke. Problems; the water spout does not allow all the water out because it set high above the bottom, and it is easy for alge to form. Have to fill often because it does not emty all the way. Filters are cheap and doesn't last very long."
4,Clarification on the Brita Ultramax 35530,"Although it is hard to draw out the last bit of water, I think this design is intentional because you are supposed to keep the bottom of the filter hydrated, so the filter does not dry out. I store mine on the counter, and have not observed any dripping. I am overall happy with my new Brita system and am glad to be buying less plastic bottles. It tastes better than tap water but not as good as spring water, of course. But it is so nice to readily have filtered water available."
3,Not what I ordered,"I gave this three stars since it is my second container. I like this one and I like the whole Brita series. However, this model did not have the electronic reminder. It came with the standard label but the instructions pertained to the upgraded model with the electronic reminder! I wrote to Amazon concerning packaging to make certain they were aware of the switch even though they are not the vendor. The price was slightly less than the same model in the store so I'm not livid, just annoyed."
1,I love it- until it cracked ( and I cried) :),"I loved the system, but found a huge crack in it wthin a month. Water poured out all over my kitchen. Yes, I must have hit it on something, but it must have been a pretty good crack. I live in a childless household so I have no one to blame it on . I will replace it, but I am pondering the choices and may look for a slightly thicker container. You do need to remove it, fill it and replace it in frig, so it will take a certain amount of moving around and should be more sturdy. Otherwise.................... loved it."
2,Basic Design Flaw,"We bought one of these a few months back. It immediately started leaking from the dispenser. We thought maybe it was a fluke, so we took a chance and simply traded it for a new one. This new one lasted 3 days, THEN started leaking from the dispenser. Looking at the nozzle, there is no washer on the outside, only the inside. So I unscrewed the nozzle, took a washer off a small mag light that I had, and put that on the outside. Hasn't leaked since. All they needed to do was spend half a penny for a washer on the outside and I'd have given it 5 starsUPDATE 01/29/13.We've had this dispenser for 3 years now, and we've had no problems. If you have a small rubber O-ring to spare... buy this unit, install the ring on the outside of the container, and it won't cause any troubles... and the battery powered filter replacement display is still working..."
4,What's not to like?,"I recently purchased this water dispenser after having a smaller pitcher. I am very happy with the increased capacity. No more filling the pitcher every four hours! Easy to fill, easy to clean."
4,Brita 35530 Ultramax Dispenser,"I bought this item, because my water is so hard,try to help the hard water issue for the iron and coffee pot, too soon to know if it actually works,I am also using it to make my own drinking water, I think it will be a good product."
5,Works great,"Brita is great for removing that ""funny"" taste from tap water, particularly if you've recently moved from one part of the country to another. I bought one for my son in college, who complains that all the water in the midwest tastes like it came out of a swimming pool."
5,This was a shot in the dark purchase that became a love.,We were recently blessed with twin girls. I had an idea of making a baby feeding/ prep station in the kitchen where this was to be used for the formula. In no time we found we were using it for everything. Filling and filter change is simple.
2,Makes a mess inside of the fridge,"This container is terrible. It constantly leaks around the spout and makes a mess in the fridge. I always have to be careful of what I put on the shelves under the pitcher because the items below always get a little damp. It is incredibly difficult to clean around the spout, where bacteria grow. It is also hard to refil the pitcher. There is only a little opening for water to be poured into."
5,Mmmm..Cold filtered water,"I use it every day for cold filtered water, so this is really awesome for me. It is simple, has enough storage to not need constant filling, but is small enough to fit nicely in the fridge very easily."
5,Good water!,"If the cat hadn't knocked the other one off of the counter I would still be using the old one. But this one has the filter timer on top so I suppose it was a good thing. Even though there is a line filter (well water), there is still a slight ""taste"" to the water here. I use the Brita filter to eliminate any remaining impurities and the results are great. Now if they would only make one about twice that size...!"
2,Impossible to clean,Top reservoir just won't come out. I'm not sure why Brita designed it to fit so snugly and have no handles or other places to hold and lift out. Pretty hard to clean when you can't take it apart.
1,Do Not Buy - Inside cleaning close to impossible,"This filter is close to impossible to clean. I have used hot water in to expand the outer case and cold water to contract the insert, and then turn it up-side down and shake it. This usually worked after a few tries, but today it's decided it's not coming out that way. What buffoons to design a water dispenser that's practically impossible to open for cleaning. I had to finally get pliers to pull it out gradually a cm at a time moving around the sides. They should redesign this dispenser immediately and until they do, I am no longer a Brita fan."
1,IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE RESERVOIR,There is no way to remove the reservoir to clean it inside. I dont have a problem with other Brita products but this is one very frustrating.
2,Leakmaster,"I've had the Brita max before and it worked fine. This time, no way. It leaks, big time. I need to return it to AMZ, and don't know whether I'll replace it with another Brita or check out the PUR. Or just buy spring water (which I can't trust) Was this thing made in China or some other outsourced factory that doesn't hire Americans?PS: I have no idea who ""Margaret Mitchell"" is, but the name seems to appear where my (Deborah Moschkin)'s comment is. What is that all about ?Guess I'll be including that complaint in my email to Amazon. I mean, what the hell?"
3,brita,I love the unit as it fits perfectly into my fridge. My only complaint is the constant management of filter particles going into the part which I drink from. It leaves the water off-tasting.
2,Not as good as a standard Brita pitcher,"I wanted to have a Brita with more capacity, and I liked the idea of not having to take the pitcher in and out of the fridge each time I wanted a glass of water. However, the Ultramax dispenser was a disappointment. The capacity is not much larger than my old pitcher, and the water flow out of the spout is very slow. I have to leave the fridge door open while I wait for my glass to fill up, whereas before I had the fridge door open for just a second while I took out the pitcher, filled my glass almost instantly, and then had it back in the fridge, all in less time than it takes for the Ultramax to fill my glass. It's also more difficult to fill the Ultramax from the sink faucet than it was to fill the pitcher. If you're considering going with this dispenser, go with the pitcher instead."
2,Great.. until you have to clean it.,"I've had mine for about a year. It's a great tank until you have to clean inside it. It's always nearly impossible to remove the shell that separates the tank from the rest of the system. I guess some sort of vacuum will happen between the clear plastic tank and the white plastic shell that houses the filter, because it typically refuses to come off at all. After my last battle with attempting to clean my tank, I'm exhausted and finished. I'm getting a pitcher version. This one's too much of a hassle."
4,Works for me,"Bought this to replace an earlier version (that I dropped). Works great. Easy to slide in and out. Fills faster than my old one. Seems to be a lighter weight that my first model. Only had it for a week, so no problems to report."
2,Misleading Offer,"Note that the product online shows it includes the following: Electronic filter-change indicator. However, the part I got did not include this. I'm not sure if it was the vendor that shipped it, but what's being displayed isn't what's being sold."
1,Product not as advertised,"Product as advertised includes electronic gauge to remind user to change filter. Not that I care much but this unit/model does not have the gauge, it has a sticker. More to the point, the description of the item on provided by Amazon says that it removes up to 98% of lead in drinking water. I live in an old building and the entire point of the purchase is as insurance against any residual lead. I was skeptical but ordered anyway based on the description; however when the unit arrived it was clear from enclosed specifications that this is not true (or at least, no lead reduction is attested to by Brita). Finally, there was no packing slip for any of the items in the box which is quite unlike Amazon. I am returning the unit and the filters."
1,Makes an excellent algae / fungus / mold planter.,"I gave up and tossed mine into the trash last night. There's no way to take the thing apart to properly clean it. So you'll be able to enjoy it for a few weeks and then it's game over. I have absolutely no idea what they were thinking about this design; it's so obviously flawed.If your kids are into nature and watching plants grow, by all means keep in in the fridge... just don't drink out of it."
2,Fungus buildup,"I bought this a while back. We have a well lit home and do not like to drink cold water and prefer room temperature water instead. after about 15 days on our dining table, we started seeing green algae like stuff in the dispenser. we washed it and the same thing happened in ten days. when we called the customer care their answer was we have to keep it in the refrigerator or that will happen!Disappointed!"
2,misleading add,The picture on add shows a digital gage in front we received an older model i complained and was told that I sshould have done more reaserch I trusted this site wont again
1,Unable to use,I received the Ultramax for Christmas and it took until the end of January before I could use it. I couldn't get the plastic insert out of the reservoir. I called Brita and they told me to put it in the freezer. I can't believe their answer to a defect in the manufacturing process is put it in the freezer. I still couldn't get it out and I called them back. I had to wait for them to send me a label to ship it back. I then had to ship it back and then wait for them to ship me another one. It was a huge pain in the neck and not worth the effort.
3,Works Great...,"Little timer thing for filter never worked but i can count months. filter and dispenser works great, fits in refrig. Tastes way better than the tap water."
5,Love my Brita,I have terrible well water. I have put filters on my intake pipes but still had a problem. I purchased this and love the way it works. I have to change filters often but most people would not have to. My daughter has one of these and also loves it.
5,Great item,"Great item for people who want clean tasting, oder free water. Also great due to the face you don't have to fill it every day or every two times you get a glass of water. Mine usually will last 3 days with me filling my nalgene one or twice a day"
5,Great tasting water!,"This is the first water filtration dispenser I've ever purchased but I can definitely tell the difference between the filtered water and the tap water. I really like the way this container was designed, as my refridgerator has the french doors and not much space for anything tall other than inside the doors. I can easily fit this on one of the shelves and since my husband drinks a ton of water, it helps that it holds a lot of water. I would recommend this dispenser to anyone!"
2,"Good idea, sub-par execution","Love brita filters. Thought this would be perfect for our fridge. However, there are 2 flaws which make it usable but frustrating. First, the tap leaks. Leaves a constant little puddle on the shelf below. Second, the tap is seated too high, which inevitably leaves at least one big glass worth of water in the bottom whenever you refill (unless you tip it, which is annoying.). Wish we had bought the traditional pitcher type :("
2,Leaky.,"The first dispenser I bought leaked from the spigot assembly, so I returned it and bought another. The new one leaked as well, and I tried constantly to fix it with plumbers tape, and it continued to leak. Had to return this one too. What a pain. Going to try the Pur system."
4,sprung a leak,"I bought this and after a fill the nozzle had a ever slight leak...i fixed it up myself...works fine, we consume lots of water...never felt better about a purchase...no more millions of water bottles..."
2,"It leaks, but at least it tells you when to change the filter","The filter change indicator is great, but if you read the fine print you'll see that it has a ""non-replaceable sealed battery designed to last 5 years."" After that, ""the pitcher is still functional, but the electronic filter change indicator will eventually stop working.""That's OK with me, because I think I'm getting rid of it after 7 months. Nearly from the start, it's been leaking around the spigot. I was blaming my refrigerator for the little puddles on the lower shelves, but then I pinpointed the problem. I'd stocked up on filters, so I tried to deal with it for a while by putting an aluminum pan underneath it, with a notch cut out for the spigot. I'm finally on my last filter, and now it starts to dribble every time I open the spigot, beyond the edge of my pan. I'm ready to throw in the towel (or stop throwing in the towel!) and get some other brand.I probably should have given it just one star, but I'm a generous guy."
4,Post Filtration Device,"A great device to use in post filtration to remove taste of chemicals as it can filter out both chlorine & iodine, even after adding some to kill any micro organisms at a reasonable cost. 10 filter pack reduces costs for 20,000 liters of waters(5,000 gals. Amazon offers a tax free/free shipping alternate to save more money lowering cost to 1 cent a gallon w/10 filter pack. Can add tsp clorox (4ppm) to top part to disenfect water, yet filter out 96% of the clorox added in bottom part to yield healthy water."
2,Non-airtight filter design creates issues,"I was initially happy with this product until I noticed some sediment forming in a ring underneath the filter itself. I figured it was a faulty filter and replaced it. Not too long afterwards it also started forming the same sediment ring.My guess is that if you pour water into the basin too quickly, it can ""rock"" the filter from its base and allow some unfiltered water to leak in. Whatever the case, I've decided to try the Pur filter instead, which does have a lock-in seal as well as a barrier that prevents water from gushing over it."
2,"Great concept, not ready for prime time","Brita filters do a great job filtering water. I thought the large capacity and the dispenser system was convenient. Within a few days of purchase, it was leaking. I repaired this by tightening the nut and bolt system at the spout. About 9 months later, I am struggling with mold building up in the corners. I wash the dispenser weekly with warm soapy water and a non-abrasive brush. The sharp corners inside and also around the spout are VERY difficult to clean and that is where the mold builds up. I got rid of this and purchased the 10 glass capacity pitcher by Brita. The rounded design inside is less likely to grow any vegetation..."
1,Leaky!,"Got this because I liked the big capacity and the fact that I could leave it in the fridge. Unfortunately, it leaks. The leak comes from where the spigot connects to the reservoir. I tightened the nut as tight as I dared (didn't want to break the plastic), but no matter what I do it still leaks. I contacted Brita and they sent a replacement, but they only sent the reservoir, a new spigot, and a new washer. No new nut. So it was worthless. Stick with a pitcher and avoid this problem."
1,MOLD,"Oh boy. I should've done my research before getting this unit.Like the other reviewer said, you MUST wash this thing 2-3x per week or you'll get mold!"
2,Less efficient redesign of an excellent product,"The new model dispenser is a redesign of what all the 4 and 5 star reviews were reviewing. They are not reviews of this current model. This redesign is a not a good one. The filtration reservoir is very difficult to remove from the filtered water reservoir so prepare to get wet when cleaning. The old model fill top was easy to get off - could be done with one hand. The new model is more difficult - takes me two hands. The also changed the filtration reservoir so it holds less water - not a huge amount less, but less. The old product was a 5 for me, this new one a 2."
4,Tasty water,"I bought this to replace my home water delivery. It is a less expensive option for clean pure drinking water. I put strongly flavored Los Angeles drinking water into the Brita and it comes out tasting fine. Often you can tell the difference with tea; this water makes an excellent tea.It is far easier to fill than expected. It fits right into the sink and I can run the tap into the fill hole easily. It's not too heavy to carry to its spot, unlike the 5 gallon bottled water.My only complaint would be that, when the water drops below a certain level, the tap will no longer dispense it, since it is below the tap level. I choose to use that as a reminder to refill.I know some suggest keeping it in the refrigerator but who has that much room in the fridge?All in all, I'm very pleased."
5,Very pleased,"I like everything about this filter. I like the design, the built-in tap makes it very handy. The taste of the water is great. I use the water filtered from Brita for everything possible. I even tried washing my hair in it, and my hair gleamed. I would even recommend washing your face with it if you are so inclined. The filtered water cleans the skin better than tap water. But, most importantly, the taste is REALLY great. And I don't have to buy bottles of water anymore."
2,Not as good as original version,"I was so excited to finally get a copy of Ivan and His Magic Pony on DVD, but ended up disappointed. I own the original on VHS and the DVD does not do it justice. Yes, the animation is the same but the dialog has changed. The songs alone are very different. I wish someone would just make a DVD version that is not different from the original. A childhood dream ruined."
1,No Russian???,those ARE the stories from my childhood - but why was the russian soundtrack removed???put it back and i'll buy a copy for everyone i love.
2,Lacking in basic information,"This book is a collection of articles that cover the processing, properties, applications, microstructure, and compounds of iridium. Unfortunately, it lacks a summary chapter that gives a comprehensive listing of its properties. Specifically, there should be one chapter listing known values of its electrical, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties. This book should have included a chapter that summarized the known compounds of this element, be they ceramics, intermetallics, or coordination complexes. As such, I would not recommend purchasing this book."
5,What a great new voice....,"I never thought I could get so many laughs while recalling the torture that we went through when we redid our house. I wish we'd read this book before we started -- it might have kept us cracking up in a good way instead of in the losing-our-sanity way. I found this book in a DailyCandy.com email recommending Father's Day gifts, and I think that's probably a great call for dads who read and have a sense of humor. I'm glad to see Amazon likes it so much that it's a Breakout Book of Summer 2004! This is my new gift of choice to fellow readers -- perhaps it'll save some marriages, not to mention some houses!"
4,"An Easy, Helpful Read","Refreshingly conversational and informal, this is the kind of book you can go through in 3 days, the pages turn so quickly. LaRose does a good job of bringing you inside the house, well the shell of it anyway, and seeing both his and his wife's predictable reactions to one frustration after another. The book itself is a great idea; everyone knows someone with these types of horror stories, but this serves a purpose as a warning sign of some of the problems that WILL (not ""could"", not ""might"") be involved in home renovation. I highly recommend it for anyone who's thinking of doing anything major to their home and hope to keep to some sort of budget."
1,If T&A make you a great player she is John Coltrane,"Awful music. She can't play a lick, but she looks good. Who cares?. I hope some of you get into some real straight-ahead jazz players. Her playing is simplistic with a horrible sound machine behind her. I do a straight-ahead jazz radio show. I hope some of you get turned on to grown up jazz and not this smoothie excrement."
1,Filter did not fit,"The part number was correct according to the Owners manual, but the size was not correct. I tried to use tape to hold it in the slot, but the fan was too powerful. I then did a search of the net and found that you need to order by size; however there was no cross reference by model number, so I gave up."
2,Works but not that great,"This charcoal filter does not kill any smells coming from your stove. Actually it only minimally decreases them. I thought about buying extra so there was double or triple the amount of filtering, but I don't think the extra filters would fit. Since it's better than nothing, I gave 2 stars."
3,Cute Costume,The sizing on this was way too small. Cute outfit but did not fit at all. Order at least 2 sizes bigger.
1,Not pleasent,"This product has a high alcohol content. Soothing is not a word that comes to mind. It's more like lighting your face on fire after shaving. I bought it and used it twice, then threw it away."
3,A little disappointed,I was a little disappointed by this book. I would not recommend it for people with DID. There were graphic descriptions and quite a bit of religion mentioned; both of which can be triggering.The positives: The book is decently written and unique in that the chapters are written as letters to a friend. It also shows one path of recovery from DID/trauma.
2,Stains Business Cards,"Beware the black model of this holder stains cards. I have to keep the top and bottom card in it at all times because the material (some sort of faux leather) rubs off on the white cards. Might not be an issue on cheaper cards, but on high end ones beware."
3,the many faces of sybil.,"almost completely overlooked by the u.s. music industry, sybil is world-class singer whose skills range for soaring dance vocals to sultry r&b to funkdafied takes on burt bacharach. it should be noted, however, that this album is a greatest hits collection (as opposed to a ""best of"" collection) resulting in the exclusion of a number of her less well-received gems. while ""you're the love of my life"" and ""when i'm good and ready"" stand out as some of her best (new) work, fans who may only be aware of her early hits will be pleased by the inclusion of ""don't make me over"" and ""walk on by"". ""crazy for you"" is also a standout, featuring rhymes by the funky divas of hip-hop, salt-n-pepa."
5,SYBIL AN ANGEL,"SYBIL HAS THIS UNIQUENESS ABOUT HER. WHEN SHE SANG SHE HAD THE JOY AND SINCERITY IN HER HEART AND YOU CAN TELL FROM THE WAY SHE SING HER SONGS. FALLING IN LOVE , DON'T MAKE ME OVER, WALK ON BY WERE HITS FOR SURE. SHE WAS REALLY UNDERRATED AND HAD BAD PROMOTION. IF SHE HAD BEEN PROMOTED THE RIGHT WAY SHE WILL STILL BE AROUND IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS TODAY. I WOULD PUT HER IN THE CATAGORY OF SMOOTH R&B QUEEN."
3,Pretty Good better at the time,Sybil has a Good Voice.and she did alot of catchy Material.A Couple Of Burt Bacharach cuts.DOn't Make me over with the Soul 11 SOul vibe that was first started on Dennis Edwards Don't Look Any FUrther.but Sybil Inspired the same Sound On Shanice Wilson's I Like Your Smile a few years later.the music was better&freshier at the time but somethings have dated still you can't deny her VOice.
2,Unimaginative textbook,"Be forewarned that this is a boring (but thorough) textbook on presenting data graphically. The intended audience must be students, beginning researchers, and untrained graphic artists. It tells readers how to graphically present data in the driest possible way and is illustrated with thousands of extremely boring and unimaginative line drawings. Do not look to this book for inspiration or for advanced design concepts. I returned my copy immediately."
2,Unless you are a technical person this is useless,"I had to buy 5 books for a graduate MIS class and this was far and wide the worst of the bunch. Im in marketing, I found this book to be utterly useless however I felt the same way about the class so I gave it 2 stars instead of one because I was clearly in the wrong place."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! I saw this book in a vintage postcard store. Then I read the review on amazon. The owner of the store called my attention to it as a book not to buy. As I looked throught the book, it became apparent the best part of the book is the cover. The book pictures a lot of postcards that a reputable a dealer would put in a twenty five cent box. The cards pictured had missing corners, heavy damage and lots of ground in grime, this reveiw sounds like a commercial for laundry soap, sorry. Even the better cards shown in the book came from a different source than most of those pictured in the book, probably an internet action source because thes images were crystal clear althought somewhat smaller in size with no damage noted. The prices listed for the cards are not realistic at all. If you are interested in postcards, buy the books by Mashburn and others. They are a lot better at providing a relistic price guide and sound educational information about cards."
4,dano. fab tone,"I've been using this pedal for the last 6 or 7 years and havent needed anythign else for distortion. The name ""fab tome"" is kind of misleading in that its more of a modern sounding distortion, but man, this thing will put out some serious noise, i love it!"
4,Hilarious!!! Looks surf....sounds metal.,"I bought this pedal over 12 years ago (back when these were really cheap from GC) and still love it. The tone is great for metal....in fact, it's hard to make it sound like anything other than metal. The mids are very attenuated and you can really crank up the bass, treble, and fab (distortion) knobs to get some screaming Metallica tones. Overall, it's a fun pedal, but it's not something I use all the time."
4,"Entering the spectra, nouveau spectre pour The Flower Kings","Cette album est un mélange de plusieurs sytles de musique assez complexes. Jonas Reingold exploite davantage sont talent de bassiste et le son ""Fretless"" de sa guitare basse contribue à donner, à l'occasion, une atmosphère Jazz alors que les passages de guitares de Stolt ramène le style The Flower Kings. Il y a aussi d'autres passages plus ""heavy"" qui ajoute une touche explosive à la musique. Le résultat demeure quand très cohérent et très intéressant.Il s'agit d'un excellent album, un incontournable pour les amateurs des groupes progressifs récents, surtout pour les fans des Flower Kings."
3,Not as god as the new album,"I do like this album, but the later album Hos the boss in the factory is much better!"
2,T-Dream With Some Vocals,"Unfortunately, not a very good Tangerine Dream album, but when you've got over 60 CDs released, the occasional non-favorite is to be expected. Worth it for the 20 minute instrumental track ""Madrigal Meridian"" though. I especially can't recommend this one to beginning T-Dream listeners... they would be best off to start out listening to ""Optical Race"", ""Underwater Sunlight"" or ""White Eagle"" to name just 3 of their many, many terrific CDs."
2,Please skip the Lyrics TD,"I own 50 or so TD Cd's with a lot being of the 5 star caliber, this in not one of them. The only song worth having off this CD is Madrigal Meridian which starts off great and then goes down hill. I rated 2 because of this one song. Who knows, I hope it grows on me."
5,Very well done,My 6-year old daughter loves this book. The cultural references in the book have led to further discussion about visiting Venice.
2,Doesn't adapt well to Kindle,"The story and pictures are fine. My 7-year-old non-New Yorker child didn't relate to the main character very well, even though she was born in Europe and is well traveled. She didn't think it would be fun to fly alone to Italy and spend a week in Venice with an elderly aunt.What was most disappointing about the Kindle edition is that however the book got transposed into digital, it isn't very successful. There are many misspellings, especially of the Italian words, which I assume were correct in the printed edition. Surely this could have been corrected with basic editing.I bought the book as a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99, and it's barely worth that. I certainly wouldn't pay whatever full price is for the item."
5,Great book,I bought this after a recent trip to Venice as a gift for my goddaughter (named Zoe). It was a great gift to include a picture of myself in the places the character is talking about in the book.
3,For Die-Hard Fans Only!,"This very slender book is not a bad afternoon read, but ultimately it fails in what it attempts to do.The author himself comes off as pompous and disengaging, as his ""trivia"" book is little more than a brief collection of personal opinions of his favorite Christmas Carol versions. These thinly veiled reviews lack the calibre of even your local TV Guide synopses. The only real trivia examples here are in classroom style question-exercises included at the end of each chapter! While I have no problem with this, the author postures himself as the true expert on A Christmas Carol with no real exposition as to why said versions are his favorite! I am giving it three stars, though, as the subject matter remains enjoyable no matter how clumsily presented.Also worth noting- The recent Patrick Stewart version is omitted from this collection. Sacrilege!"
4,"God bless us, Every one !","If you're a Fan of Dickens Christmas Carol, like I am, you might enjoy this book.It has Chapters on Dickens, the story and it's creation and the many Film, T.V, and Cartoon versions. I don't agree with the author that the movie Scrooged is so avfull, I'm not saying it's a Great movie But I found it quite Funny actually.But apart from that this is a Fun Book to read around Christmas time when you have reeread Christmas Carol, watched all your Christmas Carol Videos, stuffed yourself full of Marsipan, Chocolate and Sherry and been visited by the Ghost of Christmas past."
2,not his cup of tea,"We all know Mr Bruson's fine singing and art.This collection was a good idea in itself but is not the achievement it could have been.First of all the singer force his voice into a dark, throaty timbre which disguises its softness and beauty. Secondly he has made no proficient effort in rendering the correct style and sings the arias as he sings Donizetti.The result varies according to the single aria and, his technique being after all Bruson's technique (agility included), this compilation may well sound pleasing to the ear but is nevertheless a wasted opportunity."
2,The best concert video but very poor DVD reproduction,"Those who own this album in Laser-Disk format will find a big disappointment in this DVD transfer. When I saw this DVD at first time, I thought someone made a cheap copy from a rental video tape!! I don't know what the engineer did to transfer this material to DVD but the video is blurry and the audio quality is even worse. I bought a Laser-Disk format of this album back in 80s and I enjoyed their sound and video qualities. Now, Laser-disk is a thing of the past and I wanted have this beautiful music in new DVD format...and hoping to see some improvment in quality from original release of 80s...what a disapointment."
4,Prime Grover,"You really can't go wrong with Grover. Those who are familiar with him know what to expect, excellent musicianship, class,etc.Those who own this on video will not find any extras,and the 'access' to solos is annoying when you are trying to go to the next track. You will have to press the next track button two or three times to get to the next tune. The video is blurry and the audio is not an improvement over the videotape. Other than having this release on dvd, there is really no reason to replace your videotape.Now with the gripes out of the way, this is definitely prime Grover. The band is excellent. With the aforementioned quibbles aside, this is an important document of Grover Washington Jr. in 1981 riding an artistic peak."
3,Doesn't Complete the Job,"I bought this item in addition to a DVD Player cleaner because I was experiencing problems with my player not reading DVD's. I actually bought this item at Target for $5.19. The device worked well enough when cleaning about 12 DVD's. However, the gray material used in the device on which the DVD rotates on does not absorb the spray cleaner. It may remove grime and smudges but you will also need an optical cleaning cloth to remove the remaining moisture. Otherwise, the DVD's came out very clean and the mechanics of the device functioned well."
4,There are a few minor errors on some things but overall the best by Bo Gritz yet,"Obviously and unfortunately Bo isn't a Revisionistbut Bo's story of the last several years in hislife since his last outstanding book is more thanworth getting. From uncovering Government corruptionto esposing Patriots-for-Profit, like Texe Marrs,Alex Jones, Willis Carto, et, al this is a verygood book. Listen to Bo on the WRR broadcast ofhis very good show: Freedom Calls. Check the Bogritz.com site for the station setting on the shortwave!"
1,Warning. This series is not really from Playboy.,Warning. This series is not really from Playboy.Can't find anything about this series on the Playboy site. Contents not related to the genuine Playboy casting call features in the newsstand special editions or on the Cyber Club.Part of the new gonzo video series from some company that Playboy bought.Not the girl next door. The women are exotic dancers or something who are not very attractive. In most segments they are posing for a photographer while being filmed by a video cameraman. A few segments are audition videos in which they awkwardly talk about themselves. Editor doesn't even match the color when they jump between the two video cameras.These women have no chance of getting in Playboy. This should not be under the Playboy name.
3,Better than what you might expect,"Granted none of these models really are Playboy quality, but there are some ""hottest girl whom you know personally"" types here. And they aren't afraid of explicit nudity, which makes this that much better.Considering what I paid for it, I'd actually give it a little better than three stars...not quite four, somewhere in between.There are around 10 girls on the hour-long DVD, and the clothes come off almost instantly, so if you're into teasing you won't be happy. The vignettes are essentially a (most likely fake) photographer's taking snapshots of the girls while asking them supposedly ""sexy"" questions. I ended up muting on some of these because the discussions were so contrived and ridiculous.As long as you don't expect too much, you'll probably be OK with this DVD as I was."
1,Please be sane!,"I was stunned to see how much it cost. I got the exact same one from a Chinese grocery store and it was $1.99. This seller is crazily greedy. With the delivery fee, he/she charges about $20."
2,Be warned!,"The flavor for this mushroom soy sauce is very good. What the ad doesn't tell you however, is that the sauce contains MSG. If you are allergic to MSG ...don't buy it!"
3,It's an ok guide,"As far as some parts of the game are concerned, prima guides just don't cut it. This guide helps but at the same time an online guide is needed with it."
5,Some of the best Haydn around.,"Although John Lubbock may not be a household name in the US, his Haydn and Orchestra of St John's Smith Square are totally statisfying - especially No. 44. Very well recorded and nicely transfer on the now-defunct MCA Classics. High recommended."
3,Bought this for my wife who is artistically inclined,"Bought this for my wife who is artistically inclined and she used it for a short time. She lost interest in illustrating digitally, but the book was a great help to her to master Painter 6."
1,Wrong recommendation,This product was recommended and Amazon said it fit my vehicle but it does not (2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee). I am very disappointed.
2,wrong size,"did not fit mu 06 grand cherokee, since i had to make trip it cost $35.00 to get it wired to work. very dis appointed . we were 5 hrs late getting started."
4,One of the most full books in this category,I was very pleased to read what I wanted about Nazi history.
5,This book is a song of praise.,"""In the Midst of Chaos, Peace"" is a collection of visual and literary art that come together as a melody and lyric to make divine music and song. It takes the reader beyond all image or word to Christ who is the Image and Word of God!"
1,"Actually, I loved it.","I'm joining the soreheads at the bottom of the stack because I think they need cheering up. They all seem to be mad at the book because it's not some other book they thought it was going to be. What it IS, is a fantastic shuffle of images and characters that resolves, like an old-fashioned animation, into a kind of narrative. And, as in an animation, a lot of the characters look so alike it's easy to mistake one for another. You can regard that as a bug or a feature; your choice.For the record, this book is not much like a book by Neil Gaiman. It's a lot like books by Christopher Moore and a little like books by Jeff Noon. Maybe a little Terry Pratchett thrown in for luck. I would give it five stars or six, but all the popular kids are already doing that."
1,Unsubtle attempted satire,"I bought this on the basis of the fact that it came recommended by Neil Gaiman, whose taste is normally impeccable. When the book arrived, I cracked it open, hoping for a clever, funny read in the vein of Mr. Gaiman. What I got instead was a heavy-handed missive about homelessness. Now, I'm not saying homelessness isn't a problem that needs to be talked about and exposed. It is. I just don't appreciate opening a book sold as an urban-fantasy-adventure-with-moral-lessons and getting a lecture on homelessness with all the subtlety of a bag of bricks. I understand the author's point - he intended to write a satire, a novel in which our attitudes towards the homeless (viewed through the lens of our reaction to the transient fairies) are examined and challenged. The problem is, satire requires great subtlety, and as stated, Millar just doesn't display any here. Even the ""twist romance"" is, well, definitely not a twist from the start. I'm disappointed."
3,Entertaining but a bit breathy,"I bought this book as I am a massive Neil Gaiman fan. I must admit I expected a writing of similar style, but while the genre may be similar, what I found was a very pacy journey. The story is entertaining, and to think on fairies as you would humans, is an interesting concept. Personally though, I prefer to keep them on an altar in my mind!"
5,Brilliant,This was the most refreshing book I have read in a long time. It reminded me of a cross between John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces crossed with Michael Moorcocks's Dancers at the End of Time. It made me think all things were possible and there was an underlying good beneath all things.
1,"Not Neil Gaiman, not even by a long shot.","Although the book has a foreword by Neil Gaiman, it does not contain anything that might have conceivably been written by him. The Good Fairies was mostly boring, a drawn-out affair that I felt was more like a burden than a joy to read. It has taken me more time to read this book than it took me to read books twice its size. I'm sorry, I'm sure Martin Millar is a great novelist, but this book is a two thumbs down for me."
4,Only In New York,"In what other city could you imagine there would be fairie race riots with real fairies. Before you start this book you have to know that in the end it is cute to the nth level, enough sweetness to kill a diabetic and then some. But that's what makes it so much fun to read. The two fairies in this book who are the main culprits want nothing but to start a 'punk rock' revolution among the Scottish Fairies. So what's not to like.Enjoy this book as nothing more than brain candy, and leave all thoughts of reality and relevance behind."
4,"Be sure to read the intro! (And the rest of the book, too)","Punk Fairies, warring Scottish clans (fairies, of course), A melting pot of Italian, Chinese and Black fairies from the various nooks and crannies of New York, a bizarre version of MidSummerNight's Dream, a fiddle, the Ramones, flowers and two quirky humans...It's a grand collection, indeed.My favorite part was the Neil Gaiman intro--how he picked up the book before writing American Gods and wouldn't read it til after his story was told and sold...worried that Miller would have told the exact same tale. Which ultimately meant the book was on his shelf for about 5 years. And then he kicked himself for not reading it sooner!"
2,Very disappointing,"The story itself is compelling, but the execution left me dry.Throughout the book, the author switches character point of view constantly and rapidly. In several instances, point of view is changed four times within the span of two pages. This is very jarring to read, since you can't become sympathetic to any of the characters before suddenly reading about a different one.Additionally, there are many references to Scottish and Irish folk music and terminology that came across as the musical equivalent of ""technobabble."" Musical styles were referenced without explanation for the reader, so unless you are already versed in the differences between strathspreys and jigs and such, you won't understand some of the emotional content of certain passages. Someone well-versed in these musical styles, however, may be very well pleased by their inclusion.Overall, the story is solid, but the telling was a bit too scattered and technical to be truly enjoyable."
2,Disappointing,"After all the hype and big endorsement from Neil Gaiman, perhaps my expectations were too high. The characters are imaginative but the story is thin and after awhile all the quirkiness of the characters became tiresome. I donated the book to my local library. Hopefully, someone else will appreciate it better."
2,Whimsical,"Morag and Heather are a pair of Scottish fairies who are exiled from their clans due to a regrettable mistake and due to an even bigger one, end up in New York City. They part ways over a feud and end up befriending a hapless pair of humans--Heather takes Dinnie, perhaps the worst fiddler in humankind, and Morag takes Kerry, a tragic young girl with Crohn's and a colostomy bag.Now, two country Scottish girls in a big city can stir up a lot of fracas. We discover that every population of NYC has its own fairy representation and those fairies are after Heather or Morag for various reasons.""Fairies"" is well written with the infamous understated dry Scottish wit. The pacing wasn't quite the rollick I'd have hoped for. Humor isn't quite as funny if you're slogging through a bog of text to get to it.Characters just didn't grab my attention or my heart. I admire Millar's attempt at having a colostomy patient as a heroine, but people's natural fear of the disease doesn't bring us closer to Kerry."
2,Not that great...,"I was recommended this book as something that fans of Susanna Clarke's novel, Jonathon Strange and Mr. Norrell, would like. I read all the reviews and figured I couldn't go wrong.Well, I was. I'm not saying this is an awful book. The idea for the story is very creative, and certainly has potential, but the end result is not impressive. I felt like I was reading a very long childrens book, with some sex thrown in so it could be pushed as a grown up fairy tale (really, there are these phone sex ads on TV that add nothing to the story whatsoever). I didn't feel I could really connect with the characters, and there is so much jumping around it left me with no desire to develop any interest in anyone's story.I will say again, it wasn't completely horrid. But I wont be reading it again, and I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known what I was really buying."
5,6 stars,"Any CD or album recognized as a classic, generally warrants such accolades within it's own genre. After listening to ""a ma zone"" repeatedly for years after it's release, I've concluded that the term ""classic"" for it's own genre (whatever that may be) sells this special CD short. Zap Mama has come up with a universal gem of all contemporary musics combined. Simply put, one of the greatest musical projects I've ever listened to. By mixing instrumental, electronic, and vocal dynamics within brilliant yet simple compositions, these angelic artists take you on an emotional ride of orgasmic proportions. Abstract as the Cocteau twins and as sophisticated as Les Nubians, Zap Mama succeeds in sounding like neither. Fusing elements of funk, alternative, jazz, hip-hop and so much more, this CD provides a flawless ""must have"" masterpiece for the eclectic ear. Rated 5 stars only `cause 6 wasn't an option."
5,Superb,"This Cd is Superb. I went to a concert in Groningen and I was completly addicted to the group from that moment. I immidiatly bought the CD and have listened to it ever since. To hear five voices singing together like this group is overpowering. You have to buy this Cd immidiately, if you like the style, and that is a little R&B and the beautiful voices singing together."
5,wow,"my only complaint is that there is no way a CD would be able to capture a zap mama performance. i've seen black uhuru, fela kuti, king sunny ade, lee perry and etc. - zap mama is better. she hypnotized the audience and took us to another reality. i'm not exagerating. ive never expirienced anything like it."
5,AMAZING!,"I have been transformed. I'm actually wondering why I never gave zap mama a listen before. This album is incredible, the voices of these women are absolutely phenomenal, the music is fantastic. It just takes the listener to another level. We need more music like this! Go on my sisters! -K"
2,Mishmash trailing off of a once-promising band,"Zap Mama started 10 years ago as a ragtag, rambunctious, a cappella group of women with a very collective spirit. But by the second album Zap Mama was becoming a showplace for leader Marie Daulne and by now sounds like a mere catalog of her jet-setter whims. Another annoying example of Luaka Bop's littla-this, littla-that gentility. Shame on anyone who accepts the hip-hop on this album as anything more than tacked-on cool. More propulsive and nourishing than Destiny's Child and maybe even TLC, but is that a high standard? Stick with the Zap Mama debut."
5,"Not your typical piece of ""world"" music. Beautiful.","I bought this CD a couple years ago, but didn't really start listening to it until recently. This CD gets lumped in with ""world"" music because of its african feel, but this is a slight misnomer. Most people who think of ""world"" music think of something that should be a soundtrack on National Geographic Explorer. This is so much more than that. All of the instrumentation contained in this album give you an idea of the talent involved, and the songs each have their own mood. I enjoy the lyrical stylings of ""Rafiki"" and the high-flying vocals and moodiness ""My Own Zero"". Worth every penny!"
2,"...in celebration of ""let's throw some money away"" day...","this disc contains many various elements and styles and influences of music...that's always a good thing, artistically speaking...i like jazz...i like hiphop...i like drum and bass...i like tribal rhythms...i like good vocals...and to be honest, this cd has it all...but no one particular element dominates enough to make the various songs strong enough to stand up, let alone stand out...for the most part (outside of the roots' involvement) this makes me feel like i've been watchin an hour of ""barney"" or seseme street...this disc does settle down into somewhat of a groove at track #8.from there on, it's not too bad...but the reality is, that this disc will only make a return to my player whenever someone stops by and asks me what it sounds like...or if i need some sleep..."
4,Great! I love it!,"I have the tape of this soundtrack and it is great. If you have seen the movie Willow, you will really like the music. MadMartigan's action music is swashbuckling, Elora Danan's theme (which is the first or second track) is really pretty, very fantasy sounding. If you like the movie Willow or are a fan of James Horner, pick this one up."
4,A great soundtrack by a great composer,"When I first saw this movie in 1989 I couldn't get the music out of my head. I would walk around just humming parts of the soundtrack to myself. Well when it came out on DVD, it sounded even better. So I decided to buy the soundtrack on CD. You can't ask for a much better soundtrack. Although the soundtrack could have been longer and the cuts of music could have been in sequence with the events of the movie, it's still a decent soundtrack. If you liked the movie you should check out this soundtrack."
5,It's James Horner alright,"This is a great score but so are all James Horner scores (well, the ones i got). It's got drama, suspense, depth & vision and does a great job complementing one of the best fantasy movies ever. However, i think it's a petty that Horner sometimes seems to rip melodies off his own scores, for example compare Krull to Willow or Sneakers to Titanic. That's a pity, i guess even the greats run out of originality sometimes. Nonetheless a great score and a must-have."
5,Inspired and Inspiring,Frank Kimbrough's piano and Joe Locke's vibes mesh together exquisitely in this achingly beautiful musical offering. The interplay -- mostly the two of them but occasionally supplemented by reedman Tim Ries and percussionist Jeff Ballard -- is richly textured and inspired. Kimbrough's and Locke's original compositions are sublime in their range of expression. This is an album you will never hear the same way twice.
4,"""Willow"" soundtrack review","Another excellent James Horner soundtrack. The main theme is excellent, as are a good number of tracks. There are some bland spots on the CD, which is why I rate it 4 stars instead of 5."
2,"Stirring, but ultimately borrowed","James Horner has the reputation as a fine composer of film music, but he can also easily be placed in with John Williams, et. al. in the gamut of ""film composers who blatantly borrow from classical music composers."" Williams is primo facto enemy no. 1, but Horner has been known to dip into the 19th century music barrel from time to time for ideas. Alas, the soundtrack to ""Willow"" is one of these times. As well as the music works in the film, and I believe does, this reviewer just cannot get over the similarity between the 'Escape fromt the Tavern"" theme and the third movement of Schumann's ""Rhenish"" Symphony. One would hope that he was not ""phoning"" this score in, but I cannot imagine I'm the only one to make this connection."
5,"Wonderful, absolutely wonderful","This sountrack is just amazing. I love the movie, and I just can't put the soundrack away. It relaxes me and energizes me all at the same time!"
3,Willow Soundtrack,"The only problem with this soundtrack is that it is not split up into enough tracks. There are 13 min segments some of which is ""bad-guy"" music that I only want to hear occasionally."
3,Not for fiction,This book is for non-fiction books only. There is one short chapter on fiction and I knew that one tidbit of information already. Don't waste your time or money on this book if you are a fiction writer.
5,A must have for those who are serious about selling their wo,"Write the Perfect Book Proposal: Ten Book Proposals That Sold and Why is one of my all time best books for writers. Writing a good book means next to nothing if you can't write a great book proposal since that is what editors need to get the process rolling.I love this book because it gives solid examples of what to do and how to do it. The book is well written, easy to use, and filled with suggestions. This book will help you no mater what type of non fiction book you are writing.Jeff Herman is a successful literary agent who has lots of experience in putting together proposals. The book also discusses cover and query letters as well as some on Fiction proposals.I used this as the model for my first proposal and sold the book in record time. Since then I've gotten an agent but the book continues to be valuable. I recommend it on all my writing classes."
1,Don't waste your time if your a fiction writer,The little gold label in the top right of the front cover (which is illegible!) says this is for NON-fiction. I could not read this until I received the book! The title is misleading. One or two pages were relevant to me- I was very disappointed- and CLEARLY misled. The product description says for non-fiction AND fiction- NOT TRUE!!! I wasted my money- AGAIN!
1,Lies. All lies.,"The back of this book says for fiction and non fiction. This is false. Okay, it's 99.99% false. There is one chapter for fiction, spanning--get this--two whole pages. They shoehorned this crap in there so they could triumphantly claim ""fiction"" on their book's blurb. Not one of the ten proposals in the book deals with a fiction piece. Hell with these liars. This book is NOT for fiction.Also, there were a number of ridiculous spelling errors that even a cursory proof-reading would have caught. I won't downgrade a book for a few spelling errors, it's just the lemon juice squeezed into the wound."
5,A Perfect Resource for Anyone Writing a Nonfiction Proposal,"I recommend this book to anyone who tells me they need help with a nonfiction proposal. Literally. I can't think of a better resource on the market in terms of giving concrete examples and explaining what a proposal should accomplish, and how precisely it should be organized. A MUST for anyone looking to nail down a nonfiction proposal!"
4,Writing a book proposal,"This is a very good primer on writing a book proposal. It addresses all the key areas that need be included. It's point of differentiation is that it provides 10 examples of proposals that worked. Hence, you really get some good directly usable ideas for headlines and for content within. I was a bit surprised to find as much as 75% devoted to examples...but that ultimately is good. Too often the frontend text is vague, as it must be, but the proposal examples give you much more meat."
2,Does not accomplish what the title suggests,"Although the title promises a lot, you won't find the answer in the book. Bookcontains common sense that anyone who fancies themselves a writer would alreadyknow...i.e. check your spelling, use correct grammar, etc. Not worth the money."
2,Too small,"Would not consider this a men's watch. Face and band were perfect for me, but too small for my husband with average wrist. The band length is also shorter than most mens watches. When trying to close the clasp it ripped the hair outbid his arm.Although it is a pretty watch it just didn't fit or look natural on man's wrist. Returned watch and ordered different one."
3,My friend's dog loves this!,"Out of 50 toys, this is the main one my friends little chi loves most. I sent it as a treat to my friends new dog, but am so pleased that this has become ""the"" favorite!"
1,Doesn't toast very well,"Just purchased this toaster and it is being sent back. Even on maximum setting, it hardly toasts. We tried different breads, different settings and it just doesn't work right. We even tried toasting (on maximum) one lot of bread (not good) and followed it by another lot of bread (better, but not adequate)on the theory that it was warmed up after the first lot of bread. Forget it.On the up side, the toaster looks good. But for $80 it should toast better than my old $9.99 Black and Decker!!!"
2,Negative Function,"British style and design? Good! Chinese workmanship? Sucks! I'd have paid the extra 5% or 10%, or whatever, for this toaster if it was assembled by a reliable workforce. Why? The lever that controls the carraige never worked and the unit had to be returned for a new model. What a pain. That's okay for a cheap tosater, but for an $80 toaster it's not okay."
5,One of the best new titles to be created in the past five years,"Welcome to the world of Invincible, a young superhero who's father is not only the world's greatest superhero but an alien as well. With this first volume, Robert Kirkman does a fantastic job of creating a new modern superhero who appeals to young and old fans of superhero comics alike. What Kirkman has created, Cory Walker brings to life with dazzling pencils that do justice to both the action scenes as well as the emotional ones.If you're looking for a new comic that reads like comics of the silver or golden age of comics, then I recommend Invincible. But if you're just looking for a good story with incredible art, then I recommend Invincible."
2,Bad design,The basket is flimsy. The handle breaks and will not lock leaving you with a limp basket. The control panel and element are removeable for cleaning but the contacts are finicky so the fryer doesn't always work. I have 2 match books jammed into the control panel so that the contacts are made and the fryer will work.
1,Only works when pressing down on the front,"I bought this for my husband for Father's Day, and luckily I tried it before giving it to him. The only way that I could get the control panel to even light up was by pressing (really hard) on the front control panel and holding it down. As soon as I released the pressure, off it went. Awful!"
3,Some Good with the Not-so-Good,"The two reviewers who preceded me here have fairly characterized this album, the second volume of a set devoted to Beethoven's music for winds and brass. This disc contains some pretty minor stuff, and that in itself is not a criticism, because even works that are minor can be engaging and worthwhile. Sadly, I have to confess that for me the vast majority of pieces here failed to stake a claim to those two adjectives. The three marches that lead off the release, particularly WoO18, are the big draw for me -- indeed, they are the reason I bought the disc in the first place. The Polonaise and Ecossaise that follow are also good in their way, but then to my tastes the music slips into a bit of a quiet tedium, relieved only by the Variations on Mozart's ""La ci darem la mano"" from Don Giovanni. Brass specialists will revel in the entire album, I'm sure; I found it a mixed bag, as I just said. One can't fault the performances, however."
5,a must read of our unsung Heros,"The stories of the sacrifices our people made over the years in secret and without recognition or explanation to their families. Many casualties were falsely blamed on training accidents, weather and pilot error! if you don't know much about the Cold War this book will give you a good basis of the events of the era."
5,GREAT FROM START TO FINISH,I know this cd is now two years old...but I never get tired oflistening to it.....This is a great cd it is worth the import price.Been listening to them since Voices And Images and I felt they had some less than good material since then..but this is the best ever.
5,What Depeche Mode Used to Be,"Maybe imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but Camouflage has filled a void left by Depeche Mode, and not a moment too soon. ""Sensor"" has plenty of what made DM's ""Ultra"" good for repeat listenings - enough subtlety and variation that you found something new to like every time you listened to it. Also like ""Ultra,"" ""Sensor"" is on the dark and moody side, but interspersed with enough rhythm to keep the CD going. I was also glad to see that some of the English phrasing makes more sense (Who can forget the line from ""The Great Commandment"" that said ""chose the content between the world and their embarrassing pavement?!"") Guess I'll have to stick to Rammstein for my mangled English...Bravo, Camouflage, and welcome back!!"
5,My book group loved it!,"No higher recommendation than getting all the women in my book group to agree that this is a Keeper! Wonderful, imaginative, descriptive language and characters you don't want to stop reading about."
3,Not enough substance,"I loved the theme of this book and the overall story, but I wish the author had included more indepth Pictures of the early hoes as well as the later ones. Sometimes, I was not sure what was happening and to whom, but I loved Min and her many problems. I'm glad she finally found a lover she could deal with. I like Southern tales as I am from North Carolina. If you like this, get Sullivan's Island."
3,kinda of sad,"Keeper of the house is the story of Minyon who is sent to work at a prostitution house by her aunt as a housekeeper. The boss lady of the house takes to Minyon real fast, and trust her with a lot of important aspect of running the house. I found the book to be funny, with the things running through Minyon head about the women working there along with other things she throught about, the book was also sad in a way with Minyon losing all her family, and all the women we meet who leave as soon as we get to know them"
2,"Started off good, but very depressing...","The beginning of this book seemed promising. Minyon, a young African-American girl leaves her family in 1929 South Carolina in order to work for ""Mizz Addie"". What Minyon doesn't realize at first is that Mizz Addie's house isn't just a home. It's also a brothel. During the course of forty years at the house, named Hazelhedge, Minyon deals with prostitutes of all types, family troubles and a few possibilities of love. What started out good however, started to get depressing as the reader realizes that all Minyon does is tell us the exploits of the ones around her. All she seems to do is change sheets! I must say, I was disappointed."
5,B-SIDES?MORE LIKE A SIDES!,This cd is filled with great trakes.Any number of the songs could have been A sides on their own.Oasis have been known for putting great songs to back their singles.Another British group The JAM did the same.My only regret is the omission of the track Whatever.A must have for the true Oasis fan!
5,The fookin best rock and roll band that cast no shadow......,The difference between this album from the rest of their 3 albums is that The Masterplan brings out all the other alternative sides that only Oasis can potray....you would be the fool on the hill for not buying this wonderwall album...cheers!!
4,It's a good CD that's often overlooked.,"The best songs on the CD are ""Scratch My Back,"" ""Race With The Devil,"" ""Red Rose,"" ""Too Cool For School"" and ""Ball N' Chain."""
5,OUT STANDING!,"Loved it from start to finish! Not only does Barbara Sing at her finest, she chats with you like your old friends. Has some cute&Funny bits as well. The audio 5.1 is quite good I would have enjoyed the ""DTS"" that much more BUT this is a great concert.The Title says it all "" THE CONCERT"" and it is! I watch it on my 56"" DLP Projection TV and my Bose LifeStiles 35s Home Theater system. If you enjoy Barbars talent As I do, than this is a must have! Bill M"
5,I WAS THERE!!,"Ok, sure I am bragging, but honest, I was there. Still can barely believe it. I ammmmmmmm so happy to have this night finally to watch over and over. It was a fantastic night, she was everything I ever dreamed she would be in person and more. I have each of her albums memorized and she hit every note. WOW!!I still get tears when I think about it!!I love Barbra!"
3,Good But Not the Best,"It seems strange that after 10 years Barbra would decide to release this version of The Concert on DVD. She is in great voice, but this plays like a dress rehearsel for the show she took on the road. The song selection and scripted banter is not as good as The Concert released in 1994 from her Arrowhead Pond show -- nor is it as good as the cd release from Madison Square Garden. The extras are nice (one song from ""My Name is Barbra"" and one from ""Color Me Barbra"" -- but why not just release those tv specials on dvd already??). So this show is nice to see, but I'll stick with my laserdisc of The Concert, and the ""extra"" of Barbra performing ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life."" That's the show she should have rereleased."
2,What's the point?,They left out the Yentl Medley? That's like 'The Exorcist' without the exorcism. The Yentl Medley is the single greatest performance Barbra has ever given and they left it out?! Isanity runs wild! They could have at least included it as a bonus feature. Very disappointed!
5,The Best Concert Of Barbra,I'm a Babs fan from Portugal.This are the very best perfomance of Barbra.
1,DULL!,"HBO special was several months after this ""trial"" snoozer. Many mistakes and Barbra was noticeably rusty as this 'rehearsal' for the HBO thing loomed. HBO special was significantly polished and more perfected although without the delightful Mike Myers' Linda Richman appearance that makes this worth the star I give ."
5,"This DVD is ""Just Like Buttah!""",This DVD is Excellent! I was one of the lucky ones who saw this concert in San Jose and will never forget the great experience. This concert is much better than The Timeless Concert. More emotion and performance in her voice and stage presence. With two added songs and an appearance by Linda Richman I can hardly wait to own this historic concert. Why Historic? Because it was her first concert for her fans in a long over waited time to see her perform.Highly Recommended to own!!
3,This is not THE CONCERT that rivetted audiences--that one is only on VHS,"This DVD, which I own, is unlike the HBO THE CONCERT in that it adds to the remarkable medley she first sang at the beginning of the greatest concert ever, and practically ruins the sharpness of it by additional lyrics that go on and on. Also, this DVD excludes the magnificent Yentl duet Streisand does with herself. Her voice is less intense here than on the VHS THE CONCERT, maybe because she is less nervous here. But that nervousness makes the concert on every level! THE CONCERT (the original) has yet to be released on DVD. No problem though--the VHS concert is just fine, unless you have to watch it daily. If that is true, you might need other kind of help! LOL..."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I had this on video, so I thought when it came out on dvd it would be the same, but I was wrong! Two of my favorite things were missing on this dvd-- the 'Papa Can You Hear Me'/'Piece Of Sky' medley, which got a standing ovation on the video, and also 'Lazy Afternoon', also missing on this dvd. Instead we get a LONG piece with Mike Myers as Linda Richman! Nothing against Mike Myers, but WHY leave out such an important part of this show? I don't care for this dvd, and am VERY disappointed! They should have just transferred the video onto dvd, and been done with it!"
5,IT'S A REVELATION!,"I saw The Concert when it debuted in August, 1994 on HBO, and was thoroughly entertained and touched by the whole performance, but found much of it, especially the spoken material, to have an overly-rehearsed feel. The new DVD of night 2 of the original MGM performances shows a Streisand that is relaxed and improvisational, if not always perfect. I betcha this is closer to the performances of her early club days than anything else currently available. No doubt she was tired and sweaty by the end of the performance, but it seemed so REAL!"
5,Good quality puzzle,This is a good quality crepe rubber puzzle with the lower case letters. The sheet of pictures underneath lines up fairly well but not one hundred percent and some of the pictures underneath may seem like strange choices for the letter since they had to fit the shape of the letter as well as start with the letter.
1,Lid falls off,The cover falls off everytime you try to pour a glass of water. My old Brita with the missing spout cap is still a better option. With this filter there is only 1/8 inch lip of plastic that fits into the inner holding tank and butts up against it so that the front and back cannot both be all the way down at the same time. My old Brita had a 3/8 inch lip that fit inside the inner holding tank and never fell off.Brita has taken a step backwards with this product. The design is flawed.
1,Misled by Reviews,"At the beginning of this book, Ms. Gray dedicates the work to the members of her mothers' occult study group. I wonder if those members were the ones who rated this book with five stars? Having purchased the book on these reviews, I feel very misled. The book is hardly 'erotic' or 'suspenseful'. Buyer beware: This book has been HIGHLY over-rated, and I am sorry I spent time and money on it."
2,fairly entertaining,Well contrary to the reviews I have read here I must say this novel was not erotic at all....I kept waiting for some STEAM...it just never delivered.
3,lucid verse,"Easy to read, with excellent imagery.""Frank Gray's intelligent verse contains immense Christian meaning, undergirding his deep interest in the joys and suffering of being human.""(G.L.Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury)"
4,Occult versus Christian,"Shona Seton had inherited psychic abilities. The story begins with her engagement to the hypnotherapist, Adam Yardley. But they have met before in a past life which was warring with the present.The year was 1886. Katherine was married to Jase by proxy. She was sent by her father to help lift the curse upon Jase's family. Katherine had the ability to heal Jase's killing headaches with the help of the Christian God and the grace of His mother, the Blessed Virgin. It was going to take all her Faith to fight the demon Baharvaghosha. The past must be revealed before the present could continue.****Reader warning: Much occult and sexual content in this book. M. D. Gray's occult study since an early age and her special interest in Druidic and Wiccan ideology and practices have come together to create a dramatic story! I was repulsed and fascinated at the same time!***"
1,LAME-O!,"I tried to read, but hence!! It was dumb!It read like a cheezy romance novel...with alittle occult mixed in. Don't read this. The character's are sooooo silly...I had a hard time believing that the author was not trying to spoof us, and that I would suddenly realize I was reading a comedy....or...something....."
3,Interesting but difficult read...,"The premise of this book is fascinating... reincarnation, karma, demons, psychic powers. However, I found the writing stilted and some passages didn't fit into the book such as the disagreements between the two main characters in their presents lives. A difficult read but ultimately worth it if you are interested in the occult."
2,Disappointed,"It was very hard to connect with the main characters in the novel. After a while, you just don't care. The main male lead, Adam, was very wishy-washy. He just kept changing his mind back and forth all the time about helping her or not. If he truly loved her, no question. And how deep could their commitment be if he decided to see the other girl April within being with his fiance a total or two days in Mobile? After a while, you don't care what happens to Shona either. She is kinda mousy.She deserves whatever she gets. As far as eroticism in this book...its not there. I have read other novels with better sexual tension in it that were not billed as erotic at all. About as sexy as a toothache."
5,"Destined to be a ""Erotic Horror Classic""","Wouldn't it be great if we could time travel, go back to a past life and correct our mistakes? In The Beloved, Shona Seaton attempts to do just that. She encounters demons, lust and a temptation beyond her imagination and ours. M.D. Gray provides us with a tantalizing tulpa experience."
2,Rawhide Mini Bones,"Believe the product name/description...they are mini! They are only about 1.5-2"" in length. Not worth 20 cents a piece"
3,MINI- Is an understatment,They REALLY need to post the length of these bones so no one else gets the wrong idea. I was a little disappointed when i saw how small they are. Perfect for anything the size of a toy dog (10 lbs or less) anything more than that there would be a risk of choking.
1,Talk about mini!,"I should have read the other reviews more carefully before purchasing these for our Australian Shepard. These bones are so tiny he just looks ridiculous with them. Even more, I have to watch him with them because they are so small that I am worried they are going to get lodged in his throat while he is trying to eat them (which takes less than 5 minutes)."
4,"Used to get primium minis,but not that much difference with these","Better value than used to get,and they're hard to find locallly.They're just a little bit larger size than my ussual."
3,"Brand New 100 count 2.5"" Natural Rawhide Mini Bones Item #200","The size was fine; however, they give off a very very strong plastic smell. I ordered them because the Milk Bone Brand was no longer available - the Milk bone Brand does not have this strong smell. The smell causes me to wonder if they are good for my pets.My pets ate them and they seem fine - regardless of the smell. Therefore, I updated this review.Brand New 100 count 2.5"" Natural Rawhide Mini Bones Item #200"
2,100 Count Natural Rawhide Mini Bones,Great timely shipping. The rawhide was very thin and brittle. Other rawhide bones of this nature that I have purchased before from other vendors have been a littler thicker for the same dollar value.
5,My dogs 80 lbs and 35 lbs love em!,Both dogs love these which is great because finding a bone that they will both eat has been pretty hard. The little one doesn't like big bones and the big one devours little bones. These are the compromise I was looking for.
4,four arms,"its basic,looks like the real one but smaller.one thing is wrong doe.his top arms bend but his wrists dont twist and his bottom arms dont bend but his wrists do twist.all in all it is pretty cool."
2,L'Accordeoniste,"Four or five of Edith's best with a number of the more mediocre. Biggest minus is the distracting level of static and scratchiness throughout. Sounds as if it were reproduced from some much-used very old records. I bought this CD because it contains the relatively hard-to-find Tu Es Partout and Le Brun et Le Blond, both of which are original early '40's recordings but poor quality. A better choice overall is the 14-song Gold Collection."
3,Description,"Might want to put the cord length (or range of length) in your description. If the cord length isn't the #1 important bit of info people look for in an instrument cable, it's probably a close 2nd. Just a thought."
3,"Horrible Directions, solid build","This is a good, strong, solid mount. The instructions that come with it are next to useless. The photographs are taken at bizaare angles which you can't see from the bottom, which is where you're working. The directions say ""mount clamp to right side of vehicle"" - where? To what? They do not say. Once it's on, it seems very solid but like the above reviewer said, Warn is made in China, not the U.S. now. That's a pity."
2,Cheap and embarassing,"I purchased these links to extend my Tiffany necklaces. They were cheap and embarassing from the back, and although my hair hides it initially, when they came around to the front, it was very ugly. One of the clasps only lasted one outing, and I almost lost the pendant when the clasp failed!"
3,"Great fun, but includes choking hazard","The ball is great and lots of fun. I bought it because it would pack flat and I was looking for toys to entertain my 10-month old in a hotel room---his grandmother was taking care of him while I was at a business conference. He had a lot of fun with this ball, but ONE major problem we encountered is that a baby with teeth can pull the plug out. My mom saw that my son had something in his mouth within a few minutes of giving him the ball and we realized he'd pulled the plug out. Scary! I will save this until he is older."
3,Get a pilates ball instead,"It's not that there's anything terribly wrong with the Gertie ball. It's really nice that even when inflated it has some 'give' to it, so it can easily be grasped by a toddler just learning to throw/catch. But it does need to be re-inflated more than I'd like and it should strictly be an inside ball because I don't think the material would hold up in outdoor conditions. In hindsight though, getting a pilates ball would have been better.We got a Gertie ball for our daughter and aside from having to re-inflate it a couple of times a week we were happy with it. She liked it, it was inexpensive, we were happy. Then someone gave her a pilates ball which she likes better. It's sturdier, so she can sit on it like her own mini version of an exercise ball, it never needs re-inflation and plus side, **I** can use it for it's intended pilates purpose as well!"
4,LOVE GERTIES!!!,"I used to play with these when I was younger (maybe age 5+) and LOVED them!! I loved the texture and throwing them with friends - they travel fast/far, bounce high and never hurt. I'm so excited to give these to my little boys! Oh, they do get dirty (sticky, so dirt will start sticking), so you may have to replace them sooner than you'd like, but still worth it to me . . ."
4,Pink for a boy :(,"I understand that the ""Colors May Vary"" but its a huge bummer when I receive a HOT PINK ball for my 2 year old son. Wish there was some way that you could indicate if its for a boy or a girl."
4,Can I get a blue one?,"I received a PINK Gertie ball today. Looks durable, fun and safe as advertized. The only frustration I have is that you get whatever color they mail you. Well, I ordered the item for my son for his wish list for Santa. He wants a BLUE ""squishy bouncy ball"". Is there any way I can specifically order a BLUE one???? I can keep the pink one for my daughter but if I don't get a blue one, my son will be really disappointed at Santa!"
3,"o.k., but there must be better options","This ball doesn't stay blown up firm - in a couple of days, I have to put the straw back in and blow it up again, as it has become quite soft and not able to bounce. Also, as other reviewers have noted, the stem sticks way out and so you don't have a ball that can bounce right. However, it is great for little hands to grip the ball, as the material is sorta 'sticky' but not leaving a a residue or anything. My little granddaughter does play with it, but since getting this, I got a couple of balls with the knobs on that seems to be better."
3,"cute ball, not worth the money","The ball will not stay inflated... grrr...Then to blow it up with the straw and try and keep it at that inflated level while pushing the plug in is a bit of a pain. But, my 3 year old LOVES balls so she's not so dissapointed. It's got a funky soft like feel to it so it is appealing that way."
2,"ok, but bad design","my child has spent a decent amount of time kicking this ball and playing with it. that's the good news.the bad news is the plug used to seal the ball (not shown in pictures) is hard plastic and protrudes. if thrown this hard piece of plastic could hit your child in the head or face. i don't think it could poke an eye though. second, it won't bounce right if it comes down on this plug. third, and most troubling, i believe a child could pull the plug out with her teeth. choking hazard.i think they could have done better with the design."
2,Hot Pink for a Boy?!,"""Let us pick your color for you""... Well, I guess I deserve that much.One thing about the ball, because of it's easy to grab nature, it also attracts dirt. Since my 8-month-old BOY likes to put every thing in his mouth, it's something additional to worry about."
3,Good 'ol Gertie Ball,"These are squishy and easy to grip, just like I remember from when I was a kid. The hard part is that you have to blow the ball up with a straw and try to super quickly close it off with a plastic plug that is a BEAR to push into the ball. Every time I blow it up, I feel like I coulda-shoulda-woulda gotten more air in there if I had done it another way. Either way, it's a decent, inexpensive ball - and mine came in purple, which is awesome."
5,Our Kids Grew Up on This Album,This album brings tears to my eyes and has ever since we first I heard it. The album info says that it came out in 1999 but I know that the album is older than that because I remember these songs in this order from when my kids (now over 20) listening to them when they were little. How beautiful!! If you want to make memories and fill your home with sweet Christmas songs this is the ultimate pick. You can't go wrong!! A true glorifying of God and His son Jesus during the beautiful Christmas season!
5,Great for the mpre serious and for fun.,"I had a free chip from a past set, but this is a little bigger and closer to the casino buttons. I reccomend it to anyone."
1,Terrible quality control,Button came with black ink smeared all over one side. How someone missed this when manufacturing or packaging the product is beyond me. Spend the extra $ and buy from someone else.
2,"very small, lacking in depth information.","A child could have written this book. If you are looking for a comprehensive report of tropical gardening, look elsewhere. This is not the book. Its cute as a flip-through coffee-table book, but nothing more; all of the information it contains is basic common knowledge for any average gardener."
3,Not much going on here. Basically background noise.,Bought this album because of a great review I read recently. Very disappointing. Don't see what all the fuss is about.
5,Sublimely beautiful...and terrifying,"This is perhaps Tangerine Dreams finest recorded work, and is both sublimely beautiful and terrifying. With an arsenal of analog synthesizers (ARP 2600, mellotron, mini-moog VCS3 etc...), Tangerine Dream shapes icy, grey soundscapes punctuated only briefly by patches of sunlight, and distant ocean waves. It is this integration of the natural and the mechanical that makes ""Rubycon"" such an interesting piece of electronica. In addition to the contrast of the organic with the inorganic, the pulsing and deeply rhythmic lower frequencies, the mellotron, and the otherworldly sounds produced by the ARP 2600 combine to suggest a larger and much more complicated ensemble. Absolutely essential stuff!"
4,Hard to review,"I really like this album, but it doesn't have the immediate impact as ""Phaedra"" does. What I mean is that you can't really sit down and listen to this album as attentively as you can with ""Phaedra."" You have to be really relaxed to get the full effect...but what effect! I almost prefer this album to ""Phaedra"" because there are less songs, ergo less changes in mood, and the sound sort of drifts from one mood to the next. Also, this album is a lot more relaxed than thier previous. Listening to this album is like watching the times of day go by in a little over half an hour. Definatly not reccommended to those with a short attention span!"
3,"Good muzak, okay music...","This CD is definately meant for background music. It's not exactly captivating enough to leave you on the edge of your seat, leaned waaaay forward like it'd help you hear anything.It's good, in its own respect, though. Something nice to chill out to, while reading, or working. Don't buy it if you're looking for truly involving music though."
4,Great resource,"This unique work is an excellent resource for anyone interested in the lifestyle of the pimp and prostitution subculture. In some examinations of the study subject's testimony, I thought the authors were much to forgiving. The authors blame prejudice and racism for the exploitation that the criminals involved heap upon the prostitution victims. It is very obvious that the authors were very friendly with those that they studied. This makes it the reader's responsibility to examine the activities and actions of the pimps and prostitutes to form a complete picture of the criminal subculture. There is a wealth of accurate information that can be found in the statements made by the pimps and prostitutes that were interviewed. Though this book was published over 30 years ago, the lifestyle, and motivations for engaging in it, have changed very little."
3,Review of Street Scene DVD,"My ""Street Scene"" DVD purchase has poor picture quality. I realize it is a very old movie. However, when I taped ""Street Scene"" on my DVR last year on TCM, it was much clearer. Too bad I deleted it then. Also, the DVD case label was not professionally done. I will keep the DVD because I really want ""Street Scene"". If and when it is on TV again, I will tape it on my DVR."
5,Pure Obsession!,"One of the very best!! So happy I could get this through Amazon, many thanks to the seller."
3,WARNING,":WARNING:This is NOT a film about collecting Butterfly's;NOR is it a thrilling Horror movie,BUT rather a physiological TERROR!A TERROR; Not only for the Viewed Victim;; But YOU the VICTIM VIEWER!!:WARNING:"
1,Blu-Ray Review,What a bore fest. How anyone finds this movie interesting or exciting or suspenseful is beyond me. Fine acting yes. Everything else boring.
4,Excellent film and transfer...Very pleased with this purchase. It's one of the better films from that period that was overlook.,Excellent film and transfer...Very pleased with this purchase. It's one of the better films from that period that was overlook.
3,"for ""Psycho conisor""","Having been a fan of the book for many years now, I was very pleased to add ""The Collector"" DVD to my at home movie collection. My friends and I were especially thrilled with the magnificent, dramatic performance of Terrence Stamp! Picture a charming English cottage, now add a lovely lady,snoopy neighbor and a devistatingly handsome psychopath and it makes for a fun night of entertainment for the serious ""Psycho"" conisor!"
3,Not as Disturbing as the Book,"There was a time in the mid-1960's when movies were becoming more explicit in their handling of sex and violence, but they still hadn't caught up with what could be depicted on the printed page. This is the problem with ""The Collector"" which is based on John Fowles' novel. Terrence Stamp is quite good as the kidnapper, but his full creepiness doesn't really come off as vividly as it does in the book. The last act of violence towards the Eggar character (which is fully and horrifyingly told in the novel) couldn't be shown in a movie made at that time, especially not by a director with the old-time Hollywood reputation of William Wyler. It would take another few years for a big-time filmmaker like Alfred Hitchcock in ""Frenzy"" to up the ante in sexual violence. Whether the results, made manifest in the violent movies of today, are a blessing or a curse is of course up to you."
3,NOT like any film you may have anticipated !,"Starring: Tom Steeber.Not really a cartoon,More a surreal combo of film mediums to exploit a stories conclusion.When your star is a fashion doll, So as not to offend the BARBIE collectors and groupies.This story is pretty incredible,Well let us say it is credible IF everyone in the situation was human and 2D ?Steeber is also the director and writer and at times you're thinking,Is this HARVEY PEKAR like or one of TIM BURTONS acid trips...Maybe if ANDY WARHOL had been able to enter the digital age ?Almost felt sorry for Bianca and yet understood,""Umm ""if one can make such a statement and have some semblance of a normal life ?Cant wait to see festivals try to label this film,Good Luck Judges and maybe HORROR is best category."
3,You will save money with this manual,"I found this service manual to be a valuable tool in mantaining and repairing the KLR 650.Very detailed, step by step instructions for valve clearance adjustment and many other tasks that cost a small fortune to have completed at the repair facility.This manual is the best tool you could invest in for repairing your KLR 650"
1,Support leaves much to be desired,"I have run into numerous software conflicts with Securikey. My setup requires that we use multiple security tools to address multiple threats. I was assured by Securikey's tech support that there would not be a conflict. Guess what. THERE WAS! Not so upset about that, I am more upset that I can't get a person to talk to when uninstalling Securikey crashes my computer. I hope it doesn't take long for tech support to get back to me (I am locked out of my machine), but I am not holding my breath. I brought up an issue Oct 07 and I have yet to hear back from tech support although I have inquired several times as to the status."
4,Another family tradition,I grew up listening to this Christmas album on vinyl. It was a staple in our family and I was excited to find it on CD.
4,good for the price,This is not a top-notch camcorder but for its price it does the job pretty well. It is sleek enough to sit nicely in the palm and can be operated with ease using one hand. The movies in the day time are excellent but at night with dim lights the quality is very poor.
1,Dualit 2 slice toaster breaks,"Dualit 25375 Lite 2-Slice Toaster, Soft Touch BlackI was given a two slice Dualit toaster as a Christmas present from my son. It is less than a year old and the end plates made of plastic have fractured in several places on both end. The manufacturer passed me on to the distributor, the distributor suggested I take it back to the retailer. I don't have a receipt since it was a gift. Neither were interested in receiving pictures of the defect. This is a company that simply can't be bothered. I believe it was purchased at Crate and Barrel.Avoid this manufacturer. His warranty isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
1,not a good buy,"We bought this toaster 4 years ago and use it very little. The entire center section has toasting wires and they are lit during the toasting process but they are recessed deeply and, therefore, one whole side of the toast is not done. This has been the condition from the day of purchase. Perhaps this may be a result of the very flimsy construction. Because we don't toast a lot, it wasn't worth the effort to return this item but if you are a family and want to toast a lot, do not buy this product."
3,"Stylish, but A Bit Uneven",The title says it all. One side cooks faster than the other.I have to flip the bread or bagel slices over to even out thetoasting.
1,DON'T BUY THIS DISC!,"Got my copy, paid $70 CDN, and got totally SCREWED. The disc is a BAD, PIRATED, ILLEGAL COPY THAT WON'T PLAY PROPERLY! I tried to play this COPY in 3 DVD players: a Philips, a Samsung, and a FREAKIN' SONY! The video jumps, stutters, pixilates, and refuses to play during the last 4 songs. Yeah, it's probably one of the greatest concerts of any band ever in history...IF I COULD WATCH THE FRIGGIN' THING! Save your money and sanity...Go to Best Buy and get Roger Waters ""in the flesh - LIVE"". Better concert, dynamite band, and a concert that will send shivers up your spine for 2 hours...REALLY! And it's still LEGALLY available.STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISC! Maybe someone has a real released disc to sell...maybe."
1,RIPPOFF,"Buy the VHS and you will get the same audio and picture quality.I don`t know who is posting all these positive reviews,either they don`t know what they are talking about or they are making money off of this.I got ripped off don`t you."
5,Great DVD,"I agree with the previous reviews that the concert was excellent. And now that I've seen the disc, I have to say that they did an excellent job with the dvd.Any fan of Pink Floyd should really enjoy this DVD"
4,Comprehensive yet down to earth,"Concrete introductory book to mutual fund tradings, some illustrative examples to trigger further researches. Chapter on comments on the strength and weakness of various fund companies are especially useful. Two weakness of this book: the first one is the fact that it is published in 2005, which is in the middle of a bull market and thus may not therefore be up to date. More up to date information should therefore be sought online in the Morningstar website as well as other websites. The second weakness is the relative lack of comments of the international perspectives, especially on emerging markets like China and Latin America."
5,Excellent overview of Mutual Funds,My dad read this book & found it one of the best overviews of Mutual Funds. He said it had taken him over 30 years to reach many of the conclusions in the book - and some he learned the hard way. He wished this book had been around when he started investing 30+ years ago.
2,Written in Geek.,"While if I studied the book for weeks, I may be able to gain the useful info I was trying to obtain. I think it was written in Geek and I read it for a day or two and threw it in the back of the closet where I believe it still rests."
4,"Good, informative book on mutual funds.","Benz's book on mutual funds is a good read. It explains, in plain English, how mutual funds work and makes good, practical suggestions on how to develop a good investing strategy through mutual funds. Benz knows the mutual fund world well, but doesn't write from ""on high."" She's humble, and her advice is practical. I think this is a good real life text book. As someone interested in investing, and who wants to learn more, I enjoyed reading this book, and I recommend it to others."
3,What were you doing at 18?,"Think you were having fun at 18? Wynton Marsalis was jammin' with Art Blakey. This is just a fun album. Playing is great. Grove is great. Sonically, it's a live recording from the 1980 time period so it's not perfect, but it's still pretty good (I have the vinyl so YMMV w/the CD)."
5,Wonderful,"This album is really charming and wonderful-- and it makes you long for more solo Sasha Bell-- however great Essex Green is as a band. Pop andfolk strains intermingle really well, and there is a fine 'brightness' about it that recalls the best aspects of The Sundays, and pop folk from the'60's but with updated ideas. A gem."
4,easy listening,"I don't feel this cd is particularly romantic but it is easy background music to reduce stress, etc. The music is good but this isn't one of my favorite jazz cds. I do enjoy listening to it though."
5,One of Steele's best,"I have enjoyed all of Allen Steele's books. Some people I know think that I'm weird for reading books like his but, what can I say except I LOVE THEM. The stories are well written and very interesting."
4,Grill Parts,The parts are high quality and last for a long time even though they are a little more expensive. Good fit for the proper application.
3,A sad case of muddy artwork and sorry storytelling,"Among the Damned is the first sequel jump into the Silent Hill comic book universe. For the hardcore SH fan, it might spark an idea or two, and the creature design is somewhat detailed, but the storytelling aspect of the artwork falls apart.I believe that Shaun Thomas might be a fantastic artist when it comes to one piece at a time (with a very heavy influence from the work of HR Giger), but he doesn't have the chops to tell a story. Each panel feels like the character is simply posed, waiting for someone to take their photo.In a slower book, this might have been okay, but Scott Ciencin is trying to cram a Stephen King novel into the space of two comic books and it just doesn't work."
2,Another Sporadic and Hard-to-Follow SH Comic from Scott Ciencin,"Decent artwork with some really cool creature designs.Otherwise, the story, (from what I gathered), wasn't very interesting. The writing is composed of numerous partial sentences and the whole presentation just moves way too fast. Perhaps the story would have done more for me if it didn't come off like the nonsensical ramblings of a homeless man.There's almost no point in writing this review. One could just read my past reviews for Paint it Black and Dying Inside. Those comics suffered from the same problems."
5,Brass/Funk/Jazz,"All That is a fabulous band whose music elevates the mind, body, and soul. Being from New Orleans I am lucky to being able to go see them perform. It is well worth the money to treat your ears to such groovy music."
4,Toddler favorite,"This book is very popular in our house, getting my son to agree to story time (and thus the inevitable nap or bed time that follows) when he is in full fight mode. My two year old loves this book! I would give it five stars based on his love for it except for the fact that there are times that Mommy is not in the mood to be creative and make up her own story to it since it is strictly a picture book. Most of the time, it is not a problem, the pictures make the story easy to tell, but sometimes I am just not in the mood. However, my son adores this book and has learned how the pictures help tell the story as we discuss, for example, which way the truck will go when it reaches a fork in the road and how there is fog on the bridge. As a certified early childhood teacher, I know how important that skill is in learning how to read, so I love that about this book. All in all, this book is a wonderful addition to our home library."
4,No story here just a bold picture book,"We have another book by Donald Crews that my 9 month old son lovesFreight Train Big Book (Mulberry Big Book)so I thought I'd try this one to add a little variety to our story time. I was disappointed when it arrived as it doesn't actually contain a story. There are bright pictures of trucks, truck stations, and streets. Some of the pages do have words like ""Trucking""or street signs but there really isn't a story here, it's all pictures. The pictures are bold and bright but somewhat abstract. However my son seems to love flipping the pages and seeing all the colors. If you're looking for a story to read to your little one this book is not for you. But if he/she likes picture books this is great."
3,not enough adventure,"I bought this book because it was supposed to be one of the 100 greatest adventure books of all time. While it does have narrow escapes and Mary Kingsley was very brave, there is too much discussion of ""the African mind"". I found the constant reference to the superiority of the European colonists very offputting. Of course it was written in the 1890's!"
2,"Nice hat, but no face.",Seems ok quality and all. Probably a good sorting hat. I was really disappointed that it didn't have a face though. It was kinda hard to tell it was a sorting hat. Looked more like a tattered brown witches hat. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew.
3,Good costume prop!,"Used as silly gifts for christmas, well made had for its affordable price.Decent and good enough to be used as costume prop, loads of fun!"
2,gold toe socks,"Nice socks, great light weight, stay up well, but got a hole near the ankle about a week after purchase and one washing, which was disappointing. I thought they would be more durable."
4,socks,this product was not available in any local department or specialty shop - so finding it on line was wonderfulgold toe is my favorite brand of socksthey wear very well
2,Dissapointing,"This study book did not live up to the expectations set by other study books even by the same company. It was frought with grammatical, spelling, and factual errors. The explanations were confusing, and it offered little practical advice about how to actually take the exam well. If you need to study Calculus AB or BC for an AP exam, I strongly suggest that you try another company. This book was a dissapointment."
3,Get more disappointment if you spend more hope,"I can only say it is ok for me to use. We know this book is very old and I just need it for one year! If I need to value it, it can achieve between 2 and 3 stars"
4,Dosen't Have all solution for the problems.,"Not give every problem's solution, but it has a lot of variety of problems, help to find out the style of calculus problems.2009 Edition is better, I think."
3,Cracking the exams,"I found this book to be helpful in some capacity. Although it covered all the necessary topics, I did not find it to be that in depth (it would probably help AB test takers more than BC). Some of the explanations made it more confusing than it was without the book. The practice tests were good, but did not provide explanations for the answers, which was a big downside. The essay questions provided in the practice section were so much easier than the actual test, so they didn't help either. Overall, a good basis for studying, but do NOT rely solely on this if you want to do well."
5,Calculus,"I thought this book went hand in hand with my class. Whatever we were learning, I would flip through this book and look at the examples to help me thoroughly understand the material. Remember this is a REVIEW book, not a substitute for a textbook. I think its good if you use it throughout the year instead of cramming it altogether at once because it is really helpful."
4,LOVE IT :),"I love them!! they are great and go with everything. I would recommend getting a 1/2 size bigger, they run very narrow. but you can walk in them all day, with no problem!"
2,"good idea, bad implementation","It does not work for me when we have two ISPs connecting through this device, not only VOIP, but SSL connection and VPN connection get dropped from time to time. Don't know what in Hotbrick's mind when and how to determine which connection going to where.When you have two ISP to enhance the reliability of your connectivity, but this device made it worse than just have one ISP. I also have problems for people connecting to me through which ISP, there is no easy way for them to know which ISP is the one they should use to connect to me.But price is pretty good, that is where the two stars coming from."
2,"Good for Home, Bad for Business","The Hot Brick LB2 is a fine device for simple home use. However, that's as far as it goes.The interface, terminology, and support are horribly lacking with regard to flexibility. For example, several of the features advertised for the unit (VPN Pass-through, Port forwarding, NAT, etc) are 1. Not found in the product manual and 2. Are not any where to be seen within the interface.Also, their support line goes to an answering machine (I've called several times over a three week stretch and have yet to hear back) and their email support falls silent. I believe they have given up.So. If you want an inexpensive, light-weight option for home use. I say go for it.Otherwise, stick with Cisco."
1,Poor Support - VOIP Issues,"I will never by another HotBrick product. After numerous support calls to and hours and hours of downtime the issue was never resolved. They said they passed it on to a programmer to reivew the issue and he would contact me. I called back several times before giving up! Don't waste your time, but a Watchguard or SonicWall."
3,WOMEN IN QUEST OF MEANING AND AUTHENTICITY,"Lynn Gilbert & Gaylen MooreParticular Passions:Talks with Women Who Have Shaped Our Times(New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 1981) 340 pages46 successful women talk about their lives and their philosophies.Some pursued conventional purposes,but many directed their lives in creative and innovative ways.Good models for other women, who can accomplish even better things.This book also gives a good glimpse of life in 20th-century America.A photograph of each woman is included.In the estimate of this reviewer, the most Authentic women are:Margaret Mead, Margaret Kuhn,Gloria Steinem, Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, & Betty Friedan.If you would like to read about others in quest of greater autonomy,search the Internet for: ""Authenticity Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher"
2,Idea vs. Execution,"2 1/2 starsAttempting another soundscape masterpiece, Stratosphere has not aged so well. The music - simple, the production- dated, the performances- uninspired. There are attempts at greatness, hints of interesting fusions try to breathe a different life into the hollow art of looping. Mostly though this is more akin to like acts such as Jarre or Kraftwerk than their more inspired material. Whereas on an album like Phaedra, the mechanics of their repetition somehow liberated, on Stratosphere the mechanics enslave entire compositions into tight neat little boxes to look at, rather then truly feel. The self conscious songwriting further keeps the experience at bay, but if you concentrate more on the spaces in between the generically frustrating synth-bass-cheese, you might feel a few conceptual ideas worth the investment."
3,Just basic...,Very basic Betty Crocker recipes. Comes with the left sidein English and the right side in Spanish. Good translationand all that but everything very basic and not a lot ofvariety.
4,Cocina/Cooking,"I gave this book as a gift. My niece loved the book! Although she hasn't made anything yet, I'm sure it'l taste great!Irene Arce-Tovar"
5,english/spanish cookbook,"A great gift that I purchased for my daughters homestay mom in spain. She speaks no english, loves to cook. This book had recipes on way side of the page in english and the other side in spanish and all american recipes. This was really the only book I found by american cooks.She loved it!!"
3,good basic recipes,This version of the BC cookbook is limited to the most basic recipes. Not appropriate for accomplished cooks. Nice as gift for Spanish speaking individual who wants to learn very basic American cooking style.
5,excellent,"I was able to find a specific song I was looking for by reading the description. Everything, I wasnted to know was available before i purchased this item."
3,Songs of Inspiration/I Believe by Daniel O'Donnell,"There is a skip in CD Songs of Inspiration and at the beginning of I Beleive, it sounds like birds chirping. I only purchased the Classic Double for one(1) song, so I am not complaining; however, it is a very good purchase."
5,ANOTHER KEEPER,This CD is also fantastic.. he just has a way with inspirational songs that makes them so meaningful..highly recommended...this is another that I listen to everyday while at work..
5,Love this cd!,"Thanks God I found this cd! A real throw back to the music I listened to in college in the 80's, and have finally been able to replace the old cassette tape. Love them! :-)"
3,too sad,"I feel bad for rating this documentary 3 stars because it is really sad. I remember seeing this years ago on PBS and it really scared me, but made me aware of the effects from AIDS. These two men showed courage, humanity, humor and yes, love for one another."
1,Also makes a great wall ornament!!,This set makes a poor starter set for learning how to play and they are not much better for anything else except to hang on the wall like an expensive ornament!! Quality-wise they are rough around the edges. The bag on mine bag leaked like a sieve and at times I contemplated using fix-a-flat to seal the d@mn thing up! You certainly do not want to play this in a concert/marching band!! I did once and at times it made squealing sounds like 2 wildcats trying to mate!If you want a good set you're going to have to pay at least $600 or more.
3,Definitely for BEGINNERS.....,"I bought this book in order to find ""new"" and ""unique"" braids for my daughters hair. I was disappointed when it arrived. It really only contains instructions for common braids that I assume most are familiar with. I suppose my expectations were too high. This would be a good choice for someone who has never braided. The instructions are easy to understand, the photos are clear and detailed. If you are already familiar with a simple 3 strand braid and a french braid, don't bother purchasing this book. The other braids are just simple variations of the above mentioned."
1,Bad Book,"This book said it would teach me everything I needed to knowabout hair braiding. Boy, was I wrong? Thanks to this ... book my sister (the one whose hair I braided following the instructions in this book) now has horrible knots in her hair that won't come out. Tomorrow mom is taking her to the salon so they can cut them all out. My sis's hair is going to have to be cut like all short. Thanks ... person for making me feel bad about ruining my sis's hair because you wrote [this]... book!!!"
2,:(,"I thought that this story had a lot of potential, but was disappointed in the way that the story played out. The beginning of the book is intense because the two main characters Talbot and hi ex-sister-in-law Elizabeth survive a plane crash and are forced to spend two days and nights alone together. The situation could have led to powerful storytelling, but the author spent the time introducing us to the characters. I was a bit bored with not only the story, but the slow pace in which it was told. They walk away from the crash and each other, and soon are forced together again when another family crisis occurs. As the reader you want to see these two get together just because it could add interest to the story, otherwise it was hard to care about what happened to any of the characters."
4,So far so good,"The mittens have been what they were described to be. The fit is good and they seem like they will hold up fine. My only complaint is that there are little stickers and bits of plant material in the wool. Not a huge deal they are easy to pick out. Maybe that's just part of the deal with this sort of wool, or maybe that's why the price is reasonable. Overall a good product though."
2,Not Heavy,"Product Description says Heavy Weight, but I've seen many of these that are much, much heavier. More like a light-to-medium weight."
1,don't waste your time,"The movie fails the basic credibility test at several points- the first accident, the jail break-in scene, the final scene and rescue- that though some of the acting is good, the whole thing becomes tedious and a bore. With more work it might have been a good, believable story, but as it is it is sheer fantasy and not at oppressive as a result."
3,"Not bad, but a little dry.","In the past I've been all about the Lonely Planet guides but tried out the Rough Guide for a recent trip through Spain. Though it's a great guide, it lacks personality and reads more like an encyclopedia than a real travel companion. The small print and color scheme is also hard to follow. If you want lots of details and don't mind lugging this massive volume around with you, this is a good choice, but if you want a more concise and cheeky review of a place, this book probably isn't for you."
3,not the best,this does read more like an encyclopedia than a real travel companion.it doesn't really have alot of pictures of the places it talks about....it is a little on the borring side.
3,fun,"This toy is fun for both of my children ages 5 and 7. I was worried it would be too babyish, but they like to play with it."
1,What is it about Texas Bands copying other Texas bands?,"Is there an original Texas band out there? I just listened to samples from a Vince Converse CD(Texas guitarist) that sounded just like Ian Murray's first CD (Texas guitarist), and then I listen to this Sunset Heights CD (Texas band) and it sounds like Doyle Bramhall (Texas guitarist)! What the heck is going on? Is there a Texas blues/rock band out there that doesn't sound like a clone of Stevie Ray Vaughan.....or another Texas blues/rock band? I've never seen anything like it."
4,Serious Leadership,"The title and introduction present a tremendously useful analogy to think about leadership. Regardless of what you think leadership is, you'll find your thoughts supported and your mind stretched. A must read for everyone serious about leadership practice and about developing leaders."
1,junk,I used the tiller attachment two times for a total of twenty minutes and it seized up after tilling a flower garden with dirt that want that packed down to begin with. I don't recommend wasting your time or money with this product.
3,Just ok,"The attachment doesn't allign properly with the motor, as it requires the motor to be on it's side to till up ground. This also causes gas feed disruptions. Also, the blades don't offer a whole lot of power when it comes to hard soil. However, with the motor position being my biggest concern, so far it appears capable of small jobs. Don't buy this if you're expecting it to perform like a traditional tiller."
3,Jims Review,"The equipment works ok, but it is not built very well and I do not think it will last. I have already broken a couple of tines on it by just tilling some weeds in the garden.We'll see how long it lasts."
1,Garden tiller,This piece of junk only lasted 30 days. I would never buy another Poulan Product again. All threads were stripped. Wish I had the box and receipt. You would get it back.
3,poulan pro cultivator,"I find this product useless if used where there is vegetation growing. If there is only dirt, it works well. Vegetation tends to get caught up in the tines until it no longer turns or overheats."
3,It broke my weed wacker too,"As I have read in other posts this item ended up breaking my weed wacker. It broke the shaft at the point where they both connect. Easy fix with a piece of PVC pipe and hose clamps, but it still happened. Other than that the item works fine, I put a cindeblock over the shaft so it rests on the guard in an attempt to reduce the bounce. This worked fine, I don't have to do much now other than hold it back and knock rocks out that get stuck in the blades. It has held up to this added weight and hard work of breaking new soil, so I'm not sending it back all in all I'm pleased with my purchase, it does exactly what I expected."
3,did not work out of the box. had to take apart transmission.,I bought this poulan tiller attachment off amazon because of its good reviews and it cost $10 less than at Lowes. When i tried it out the times would not spin! I took the transmission apart and found the cable in the shaft was not inserted into the transmission so it just spun. Easy fix but should not have came from the factory like this. The tiller is pretty powerful and I am happy with it.
2,Poor Construction,"Needing a mini tiller for my raised garden beds, I purchased the tiller attachment for my Poulan Weedeater. Since raised bed soil is light and reasonably uncompacted, I had no doubt this attachment would be sufficient. And it was.......for 30 minutes! After it stopped tilling, I dismantled the gear box and discovered that the main drive gear, powered by a worm gear, is made of BRASS....arguably the softest metal this side of lead. The gear's teeth were worn down to nothing."
5,Cultivator a winner!,"I was quite pleased with the Poulan Pro weed trimmer that I purchased last year, and was hopeful with the purchase of the matching cultivator. It has not disappointed me! In preparing a new garden for use, this cultivator has gone ""above and beyond"" the call of duty. I would heartily recommend it (not for large gardens, but for small gardens and yard use it is terrific)."
1,Broke down second time we used it,"The wife was working her garden area the first time and loved it, the next time she used it she told me it smelled funny, when I looked at it it was overheating and then the gear box locked up and the tines would not turn any longer."
1,Lasted one day,Bought this attachment at walmart. Lasted 1 day and then gears began grinding and blades would not spin. Took it back.
2,Looks good until you use it.,"The cultivator is easily jammed with nickel sized stones getting caught between the blade and the bolts that attach the housing. Unfortunately, the flexible drive rod is centered by a nylon sleeve that quickly disintegrated on the second jam. Thus, the cultivator no longer stays engaged. As a senior citizen, I was hoping to use the cultivator to week between my vegetable rows. I didn't get through the second row and the sleeve broke. I took the entire unit to my local Poulan service repair. They just shook their head at the design. They are trying to help me make it operational, but are having difficulty identifying whether the nylon sleeve is only available as part of the entire assembly--which is big bucks! Unit was impressive on the shelf but not functional for the average gardener."
3,Works good for flower beds,I purchased this to help stir in some soil additive to help loosen up my soil. Cultivator wanted to bounce and bang trying to go forward but smoothed out and dug down when operated backwards. It is kind of hard on the back and awkward to operate.
1,JUNK,DO NOT BUY!!!! I used mine for less than two hours in soft soil and the large gear in the gear box stripped it's teeth!
1,the weak link,We tilled up a few small beds when the shaft broke off from the cultivator. It did a good job when it was together. I notice this happened to another reviewer. Seems like Poulan needs to take this one back to the drawing board.
5,Literalmente de la A a la Z,"Un ensayo en datos personales del autor llendose con orden alfabetico estricto, muy aleccionador y detallista de su vida, creencias, experiencias y etc'sLo mismo, si uno es lector de Fuentes te sientes como que estan en una rica conversacion tu y el autor"
4,Two books rather than one?,"The author clearly loves his work, the dogs and the outdoors and for much of this book we are entertained with his adventures.The rest of the book concentrates (loosely) on training your dog. I found it to lack the detail and layout to use as a training manual. Although it is a fine read I would prefer to see more of a reference manual and read the anectdotes with a cognac at the end of the day."
5,Grouse hunters dream come true.,"I wish I had this book 20 years ago. If you are sick of using a shock collar like I am, then this is the book for you.I was able to keep my renegade English Setter within 50 yards while in the grouse woods. I am also able to keep my springer within 10 to 15 yards.Pay special attention to pages 145 and 146.Thanks Mike for writing this book."
4,Gun dog who hates guns,"What a nice book! Read this in two sittings, with my huge six year old chocolate lab (with impeccable bird bloodlines) laying at my feet. He isn't a gun dog, but has great instincts. Gould's book isn't a ""how-to"" but a good primer on getting the feel of the dog and your relationship. My dog is a natural bred retriever---that's ""his job"" and he does it without training, but responds nicely to Mr. Gould's ideas about control. Haven't ventured into the field with my ""house lab"" but after reading, I may give it a try in the autumn. Nice diversion from the norm...recommended."
5,If you are thinking about training your lab to hunt,"Mike Gould's style of writing brings you right into the book, like you are actually sitting at the kitchen table with him, drinking coffee, and discussing hunting dogs. When he discusses training, it is like Mike is right over your shoulder advising you what to do. He shows the would be trainer that a labrador retriever can become an excellent companion, that will hunt his/her heart out for you. Forget about the e-collars (shock collars), Mike Gould's method of training creates confidence in your lab without all the cruel negative training techniques."
1,The Labrador Shooting Dog,"If you like stories then this is the book for you. Gould does not discuss training until you are half way through the book. The training starts with introducing the dog to the field and the waist cord. You will do better to look elsewhere for more in depth training information, especially if you need to start training at the basic level of come, sit and stay. I would recomend ""Game Dog"" by Wolters. He is precise and compasionate in his training techniques."
3,not for the beginner,"If your looking for a book on step by step training methods this is not the book you want. The author spends alot of time on his opinion and philophy of what a dog is capable of and how to get the maximum from your dog. I find this very refreshing in a dog training book, it does make you think about what you and the dog are doing when you are when you are working your dog."
1,Waste of time,"I am a novice upland hunter who recently purchased a lab and wanted to train him as a hunting companion. Based on the reviews and description I thought this book would be a good place to start. I was very wrong. The first 50 or so pages are the author carrying on about what is wrong with the field trial circuit and justifying his feelings, he could have summed this up with a single line and moved on. Each chapter is light on actual training technique and heavy on tangential stories of different dogs/trainers/ and how good he or the dogs/trainers are and it adds little value to the book. With regard to training for handling the author actually writes that it would be redundant for him to cover handling so he won't. At that point I threw the book down and will not continue. This book was frustrating to read, the author changes his tone and point of view several times in each chapter, and with a byline of 'Training the Labrador Retriever...' I thought this book completely missed the mark."
2,Not Very Useful To Me,"While it is obvious that the author loves his Labs, this book isn't very useful for the average joe looking for training techniques. He spends more time talking about the dogs traits and his love for the dogs, telling stories (getting side-tracked) than specifics. If you already have one or more good training books, this one might supplement your knowledge on a deeper level, but that's about it. I do believe that the author is an excellent dog trainer, he has a great reputation, but this book won't make you like him. It's more of a novel, with a little training thrown in, than the manual I was expecting. If you are looking for a novel type book, you'll be satisfied, if you are looking for a manual, like me, you'll be disappointed and have to order another book."
2,Mixed bag - worth picking up on the cheap,"This is a chillout CD that really doesn't compare in overall quality to similar CDs put out by Ultra Records. There are indeed some good tracks here - ""London in the Rain,"" ""One Design,"" ""Daylight,"" ""The Hero of the World,"" ""Thru Da Mist"" - which are worth tracking down. But a CD like this needs to set a consistent mood, and for that you need a DJ/Producer who's willing to provide an overall vision and sequence the tracks in a meaningful way. There are too many throwaways on this CD for me to recommend it as a purchase for most people, sorry to say, and I'm someone who really enjoys chillout and downtempo mixes.The cover model is Jessica Hall. No, she's not British. If you want to see more of her, she's had a longstanding relationship with Playboy Enterprises. She's probably the reason most people bought this release when it was in record stores."
3,Questionable Fit,"Box went together & installed easily, but intake tube is about 1 to 1.5"" too long when installed on stock 4L Jeep for which it is specified. Causes rubber hoses at each end to be forced out of alignment. Due to material & shape, tube cannot be modified. The only solution appears to be to cut out part of steel box which includes tube & filter flange, reposition it, & reweld it into place."
4,Timex Reef Gear,"Overall the watch is pretty good, lots of nice features that are easy to use. My only complaint is the band, which seemed to rub on my wrist where the rubber parts were. Might just be me, I changed it to a nylon fast wrap strap and love it now, but I've always preferred the fast wrap strap for comfort."
3,A little complicated...,"Overall I like the watch. It's nice looking, easy to read and very comfortable to wear. However, I feel the controls for the stopwatch/chronograph/timer/etc. are difficult to use and not intuitive at all. I've had to refer to the instructions more than once to do very simple functions. (I should also admit that this is my first digital watch, so others with more experience may not find it difficult to use.) Also, while the temperature sensor seems to be accurate (when compared to external thermometers), the watch does have to be off my wrist for at least 20 minutes to get an accurate ambient reading...something I didn't realize until I got well into the watch's instructions."
4,This is a really good book.,I read it in one setting. Everything he writes is great and I've read them all. He's made Falcon a legend. I can't wait for more.
1,This is not 16 gauge wire.,"The review and price say 16 guage. It isn't; probably 18 or 20. Amazon screwed me here - I have only this one day to install this system, so I don't have time to return and reorder. At least it's only for the surrounds."
2,no good,It didn't work that wellWas no good!Would not buy at all because I put one in a friends cigarette and they didn't even notice
1,No Stink!,Received this product and stuck one in my husband's cigarette. He never even realized anything different. He only had a couple cigarettes left in his pack so I know it was smoked. We went to a friend's house shortly after and stuck a some in a couple friends packs. No one noticed. There was no offensive smell (other than the cigarette itself) or taste. Next time I will stick with the exploding loads. These did not work at all.
1,Lame! DOES NOTHING,The item was never even detected by the user. Not at all a gag. Cigs don't exactly taste GOOD anyways.
4,Imaginative storytelling,"This book is really something. Beautifully crafted, it has an intriguing plot and a compelling cast of characters, all deeply rooted in the beliefs, values, and practices of its medival setting. It is one of those rare books in the romance genre that are both historical and romantic. The love that grows between Juliana and Sebastian amidst the worst of circumstances has a heartbreaking tenderness that makes their eventual ""happy ending"" all that much sweeter."
4,A different kind of love story,"I picked up this book because I enjoyed My Wicked Fantasy. Although I agree with other reviewers that this book is a little wordy, I thought Ms. Ranney made it work. I truely cared about the characters, and didn't find the book to drag at all. True, the sex scenes are somewhat graphic, but unlike other readers, I didn't find the need to count them. I found the history interesting, and I thought Ms. Ranney did a good job of interweaving the history with the development of the characters. Once the reader knows the history, she can understand Sebastian and Juliana's motivations. If you're looking for a historical romance not set in the Regency time period, this is a good place to start."
5,For the intelligent reader who wants a great love story.,"I think Karen Ranney's books appeal to a different type of romance reader - the one who wants something intelligent and different. My Beloved is a great love story along with being thought provoking. Frankly, I think those who don't like this book are more the boink-boink fest types as mentioned earlier. This is a beautiful, glowing story of a deep love. It has beauty, passion, mystery, and a poignancy that marks all of Ranney's books. But, like I said, it won't appeal to all readers - only the intelligent ones."
2,A disappointment,"I loved A Scandalous Scot and so I tried other books by this author. Some were okay. This particular book had good reviews, at least where I looked, so I tried it. I thought it was horrible, pure torture to finish, but I did. The only good comment I can make about it is that it worked well as a sleeping device, I was in dreamland almost instantly."
2,Not my Cup of Tea,"I picked this up because of the good reviews not only here but on TRR and AAR. I have two words to describe this book. NOT EXCITING! This book is completely boring! I had a really hard time getting through this one. Don't get me wrong, Sebastian and Juliana did have a sweet love for each other (although I had a hard time with his disability...YUCK) but there was absulutely nothing at all exciting about this book. I was not blissfully anticipating the next page or chapter. I did not squirm and my heart strings never ached. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about. All in all, more than a little dissapointing. I will not be in line to buy the next one."
2,A real yawner,"This book is slow-moving, indeed. I can appreciate history and classic thinkers. I don't want those things to overshadow the romance. Sebastian and Juliana spend most of the book thinking about each other or watching each other. BORING. As far as the earlier reviewer's concern with the ""boinking"" [sic] scenes, whatever. They were few and only in the last 75 pages of the book. I thought the secret and the miracle and the resolution of seemingly insurmountable problems just a bit pat. Pass on this one."
2,Slow and boring book,"The book was slow and boring. There was too much dialogue about nothing important and too little action. The plot was unbelievable and the hero and heroine were unbelievable characters. At the end, the book pretty much imploded with no thrilling conclusion. I've never read anything by this author, but the book jacket sounded interesting enough so that I bought the book - Big mistake."
1,Not one of my favorites,"I found this book to be slow moving and boring. I was compelled to find out why the hero could not touch the heroine and the outcome, otherwise, I would have put this book down."
2,Pretty but cheap,"Yes this necklace is lovely, but it is extremely cheap. Less than 24 hours after I recieved it the opal fell out. I honestly don't even think it's real silver. It tarnished very quickly, and I had to gorrila glue the opal back in, and that helped it hold. Other than those it was a beautiful necklace and I got many compliments on it."
5,works great on your lap,"Even if you don't have a smooth hard surface to type on, you can lay this flexible keyboard on your lap for the ultimate in ergonomic comfort. You can also accidentally spill some coffee in this keyboard without cursing or freaking out - because it's all sealed in this rubbery polymer. Just rinse and dry and you're ready for more clacking.Takes some getting used to - sensors for the embedded keys are right in the center of each key - so you will have to be a more thoughtful keyboarder, but like any new input device, you soon adapt to its quirks - or in this case, it's qwerty."
4,Quality wires,"I hate using wireless setup on my home network, purchased these so my PS3 could have a wired connection. Ran wires outdoors through windows and have had hooked up over 6 months with no issues. Found an increase in my speed connection and I am really happy with my purchase."
3,Must read,"Although I had expected so much more out of this epilouge to Bridges of Madison County, if you have read about the Bridges, you must read about the lives of Robert and Francesca after their love affair. I wish Francesca had played a bigger part in this second book. If you went to the Bridges you must walk the roads!"
4,Great Ending,If you loved Bridges of Madison County this is a great story to tie everything together. Loved it!!
1,yeah right,"This is, what you call, a quest for money... Considering the planetary success of ""Bridges..."" it became obvious that any day now, one should expect a sequel... Which is not entirely bad, when you come down to the bottom... what makes it bad is how that sequel was written...Without any kind of emotion, or as once were said for Kerouac ""that is not writing, it is typing"", with cheap philosophy, small minded attacks on academic world or any kind of higher education, presenting life in a way that never existed, with narrative that every house wife can tell you in five to six minutes, it is a sad thing that someone actually printed this.Well, what can you say, if you have any taste, you will skip this one, you can think of a better ending of ""Bridges..."" for yourself..."
2,Lacks inspiration,"I found the Bridges of Madison County to be full of emotions and uncommonly well written. Each word was important and each feeling rang true. I liked it so well that I then went on to read all Waller's other books and found them all to be good, not all excellent but certainly good.This sequel feels like it was written as a compromise, by someone who didn't feel at all like getting into this story. This book totally lacks inspiration. I always felt as if the writer was being careful to be clear, but did not feel at all the feelings he was giving his characters. As well, a lot of the typical Waller expressions, such as ""last Cowboy"" and such, don't come off at all. They sound dated and don't succeed in instilling a mood. It almost feels as if this was a group effort. Overall a very disappointing read."
1,Robert James Waller should have left well enough alone.,"If ever there was a book that shouldn't have been written, this is it. This epilogue was terrible. The Bridges of Madison County was such a triumph. It was perfect. It left you wanting more, but in a good way. It made you wonder ""what if"" and allowed you to let your mind wander in a million different directions. Robert James Waller should have left well enough alone. It wish I had never read this epilogue. What a disappointment."
1,A disastrous epilogue to an excellent story,"It would have been much better if this book had never been written. The story in this volume takes place in the time period after the wandering photographer (Robert Kincaid) left Madison County, Iowa, following his short love affair with the conventional wife of an Iowa farmer (Francesca Johnson), until his death. Actually there is not much discussion about Francesca; rather the story is focused on Robert's new discovery of his forgotten son produced from a one-night sexual encounter with a free-spirited girl in Northern California when Robert was much younger. This epilogue dilutes the beautiful love story between Robert and Francesca described in The Bridges of Madison County, which I have always defended against pretentious friends who regarded it as a trashy romance novel. It appears to me that Robert James Waller was forced to write this terrible ""A Thousand Country Roads"" for some reason which I don't understand."
2,what a disappointment!,"I saw this book at a store and immediately felt I had to buy it. I had already read the Bridges of Madison County and absolutely loved it. When I saw an opportunity to find out more about the beloved couple, I didn't hesitate for a moment, I should have though!Throughout the story I kept thinking that maybe on the next page will be the reuniting of this wonderful couple. I kept turning page after page after page, still waiting for the reunion. Instead, I was introduced to characters I had never heard of nor did I care to meet.By the end of the book, I felt robbed of the chance to have closure for this couple. All I could think was poor Francesca...all her life she spent waiting and hoping...what a disappointment. After I finished the book, I closed it and then proceeded to toss it across the room, I was so disappointed and angry at the end result or lack there of.Save your money...or atleast don't get your hope up!"
1,BookWorm,"I loved Bridges, but I can't say the same for the sequel. I think the sequel should never have been written."
1,A Thousand Worthless Words,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was boring. The ""plot"" twists were obvious. The ending was bad. Don't buy it - borrow it from your library if you must read it. I feel like Waller churned out some garbage just to capitalize on the popularity of Bridges. bad bad bad"
3,Quietly affecting and recognisably real,"For readers who were mesmerized by the poignant whirlwind affair between National Geographic photojournalist Robert Kincaid and Iowa common housewife Francesca Johnson in The Bridges of Madison County and hoping to get a glimpse of their reunion, they will be sorely disappointed in the conclusive epilogue A Thousand Country Roads. It focuses instead on the impact of their torrid affair as Kincaid and Francesca wallow in the emptiness of their lives as they revive memories. It is a cutting miasma of depression as Waller explores the fragile humanity through Kincaid's isolation and his unexpected legacy while Francesca continues to speculate the what ifs. The starkly heartbreaking landscape Waller paints through poems and details at Big Sur in 1945 as well as a short-lived affair renders this trip back to Madison County a frutiful one. Its lack of drama makes it quietly affecting and recognisably real."
2,Disappointed,"I started reading this book about five times before I forced myself to continue, and the journey to the end was less than moving. Although there are references to Robert and Francesca's love affair, those accounts are scattered throughout the book and garbled with other facets of Robert Kincaid's life. Francesca's life is portrayed as one walk to Roseman Bridge after another, which renders further focus on other facets of her life and even some character development. The Bridges of Madison County is so wonderfuly poignant . . . it is a pillar that should stand alone in its splendor."
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed with the book. It was not what I was hoping for. The whole thing with the son, it just really went off course."
2,misled,"OK, HERE I WAS ALL EXCITED THAT A EPILOUGE WAS OUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO FRANCESCA AND ROBERT. BUT, THE AUTHOR DECIDES TO THROW IN A BUNCH OF NEW CHARACTERS !!! IT LEFT ME FEELING SAD AND DEPRESSED. HE SHOULD OF SOMEHOW, LET THE TWO MEET. I FELT MISLED BY THE AUTHOR, BECAUSE HE MADE YOU BELIEVE THAT THE BOOK WOULD BE ABOUT FRANCESCA AND ROBERT. OH WELL !!"
3,This Ending Seems Unrealistic To Me,"A Thousand Country Roads is an epilogue to The Bridges of Madison County. In my opinion, it wouldn't stand alone, and should only be read if one has read The Bridges of Madison County, loved it, and are so captivated by the characters that you would like to know more about the story of their lives. Will you feel better about the emotional happiness of the characters after reading the book? I didn't. I thought this book was just a bit too much. Too many almosts and what ifs, too many coincidences and lost chances preventing the characters from finding the happiness they desired, and you may wish them to have. I know that some folks have felt that the ending is just the way life often turns out, not always what we would wish for. But for me all of the coincidences, and near misses, were more than what would likely happen in real life."
3,A Thousand Country Roads,"I had high expectations for this book. I couldn't wait to read it. I am a true romantic, and was alittle disappointed with the ending of it. I will not spoil it for anyone, but I felt such a let down. It was written very well, but not as good as the first book, The Bridges of Madison County."

1,Crap.,This is the worst charger I've ever owned. Please don't put yourself through the misery of owning it yourself. In my experience Lenmar products tend to be horrendous. It burns up and will not charge anything unless all 4 slots on either side are full so you cant charge 3 batteries at a time. Ever. Terrible product.
4,FANTASTIC SOUNDS.,If you were in and around Spain in the 70's as I was then you will love this CD collection. I purchased the LP Juan Carlos Calderon Y Su Taller De Musica and never thought I would get to listen to this talented musician of the 70's and his wonderful sounds and compositions on a CD package like this. Great disco of the 70s and other renditions make this a great buy for lovers of this period. In Cuentos de Alhambra one's mind wanders around the passageways of this magnificent Palace in Granada. Track 4 Una Bella Historia is quite enchanting and romantic. In all a very interesting CD. I much prefered disc 1 to disc 2. Loved the arrangement of the Roberta Flack hit Killing Me Softly. Number 1 CD would make a great movie soundtrack then everyone would get to listen to this beautiful music.
1,I hate it,"This mixer is attractive and does come with three kids of beaters, but that is all that is nice about it. There is not five speeds. It shows five, but really there is only three, fast, faster and oh my h***. It is great for beating eggs or potatoes. But if you are mixing anything that requires flour or powdered sugar be prepared to wear it. Speed one flings flour everywhere no matter how little you add at a time. Not to mention that yes it has power. To much if you ask me. I really have to man handle it to keep the bowl from flying. Also after one use the socket where thr beater goes in on one side got misalligned. Meaning the metal on the outside no longer lined up with the plastic on the inside. So I have to fuss with it to get the beater in or out. Do not buy."
5,The most visionary business book of 2004,"This book is essential reading, not just for those in the advertising and entertainment industries, but for anyone who wants to be successful in marketing and selling any type of product in the 21th century. It's like ""Future Shock"" in the sense that it is the first serious exposition of cataclysmic changes in how we will be exposed to new products and information in the years ahead.I have armed myself by reading this book (twice) and anyone else who wants to retain their competitive edge, or who is just curious about what the future will look like, should do the same."
3,I was pleased to find this book,Edgar Guest is like Saturday Evening Post covers. Evidence of a 'kinder gentler' era. Thanks.
4,I dont get it...,"usually imports are better than the us edition, but my copy has 14 songs, and this only has 10, and the us version is cheaper."
5,A Must Read,"For parents and concerned friends and relatives of anxious children, Dr. Dacey and Dr. Fiore have co-authored the definitive guide for dealing with anxious children. As a parent, and now a grandparent, I highly recommend this informative, reassuring and inspiring book."
2,Hard for the non-psychology expert to understand.,I found the advice impractical in the home setting. I would not recommend this book for parents or teachers. Perhaps those in the clinical setting would find it helpful.
4,Doesn't look like the picture,"While I am pleased with this hat overall, I was disappointed to find the green and black checkered band is not checkered at all, but solid, bright green. It wasn't until after I purchased this hat that I realized there is a slightly more expensive hat that has a checkered band, but that is apparently still rather bright. Also, in this hat the feather is sticking straight up the tall part of the hat, instead of to the side. The slightly more expensive hat has removable feathers, so maybe you can adjust their direction.Overall, it's a good hat, but it's not screen-accurate, nor is the picture on amazon accurate."
1,Feathers were in bottom of box when it was received,The hat is nicely made except the feathers were not protected and are broken in half. Amazon does not allow for an exchange. Also the feather shown in the picture is not what is shipped with the hat. They are skinny and short. disappointing.
1,This hat is not worth it.,"This hat has several problems.1. It is not as pictured in many ways. The green checkerboard band under the brim (which is fairly faithful to the movie in the product shot) is a solid, bright, kelly green on the hat I received.2. The hat will not stand up, no matter what I try: stuffing tall tubes of card stock inside, coat hanger, etc.3. It is so floppy that it slides around on my head with the most modest of movement, even after adjusting the size.4. The feather is completely mangled.The only good thing about it was the low price. I guess you get what you pay for. It's almost not worth the time it would take to return it."
3,"you get what you..... yea , no.","the hat is very nice to look at from a distance. it's a great one time prop. maybe a two time prop. i used mine for Kumoricon in Portland,or and it barely survived. i was not being ruff with it. just your basic trying to keep in on your head and taking it off. the feathers are really ratty or they were on mine. how ever, if you are savvy with a needle and thread you could easily turn this into a top notch hat. the fabric itself is good. the construction is what SUCKS. its not completely worthless, but its close."
5,Great for Halloween!,"I used this hat for my Professor McGonagall costume. It was a hit! Even if people didn't know Harry Potter characters they still thought I made a great witch. There is bendable wire in the brim that's a little hard to form at times, but the quality of the hat is nice. Also there is a string in the back that I wrapped around my bun for security."
3,Not a bad purchase,"This was a good purchase for a costume I was putting together for the HBP movie premier. While my hat did get squished in shipping, it shaped up alright with some stream and fit perfectly for my adult head. I looked fantastic -- if I say so myself -- and it was a big hit over all. While I had wished the price a bit cheaper, the fabric, construction and swift product arrival made up for the price.-BB-"
2,nude art vs pornography,"Received book expecting ""david hamilton-others"" material-- instead found ""Hustler etc"" typical approach--very dissapointed-returned book same day--(would be great if ALL photo books this subject could show some example of material,including whether bw or color)-have returned several others since trying amazon for similar/same reason. great service,tho--thanks,hondaspl."
5,Really nice and easy to use.,"Has a really nice neutral odor, i guess if i had to say its a ...clean smell if you can wrap your brain around that one. works just as easily on low running shoes as it does on high work boots and its only needed when you can smell you need it. haha."
3,"Nice smell, easy to use, not convinced it helps","I used this product in a pair of slip-on shoes that I love but had begun to develop an odor. This product has a nice smell and I love the way it sprays. However, it didn't seem to clear up the odor.... Rather it just tried to cover it with perfume. I'm going to try it proactively in my new pair to see if it has any prevention qualities but I may have to go back to hidden socks."
1,What Does It Mean To Serve The Resurrected King?,"Professor Carson like many so-called evangelical Bible-believing theologians in the USA is misguided in their approach to the New Testament. They completely ignore the reality of Christ the King who is resurrected from the dead and sits on the right side of God the Father (Jesus Christ as we know is God the Son). He is no longer the humble servant going to the cross; He is the resurected eschatological Judge who reigns and leads Heavenly armies. The Book of Revelations call Him, the King of Kings and the LORD of Lords. Professor Carson and many so-called Bible-believing Christians want to imprison Jesus Christ in his state of utter rejection and humility and leave Him in the grave. No, Professor Carson. Have you not read the Bible? Jesus Christ is resurrected from the dead -- He has risen! He is King of kings and the LORD of lords!"
3,Okay For A Quick Meal,Most of the LaBriute line strikes me as too pricey. This is one of the few meat entrees that is close to being reasonably priced. Portion is adequate and fairly tasty. Definitely useful for a quick meal or on trips.
2,"Easy to cook, hard to eat","This item is kosher, stores easily, was cheap, can be heated with any microwave according to kosher law, and is a cute concept.Unfortunately that is where the praise ends. The dish is SALTY, the potatoes are tiny, the meat taste like dog food and while never trying it myself, this product reminds me of ""D Ration army food""Bottom Line... pack a bagel and cream cheese and save your cholesterol.."
4,Very nice doll,Our daughter loved this doll. Her eyes open and close and her hair/brush are great. She is very well made and my sense is that she will last for years. I was very happy with this purchase.
5,Amazing is the only word for it.,"This is an exceptionally nice espresso machine for the price. Seems very well built and makes great coffee. I've had some very expensive machines before (Gaggia and Jura) and wasn't expecting too much for so cheap. But I was (and still am) completely amazed by this little machine.The only thing it lacks is a decent 'tamper'; it comes with a combination scoop and tamper that works, but it's lightweight plastic and a little difficult to get a good tamp with. It's worth spending ten bucks to get a solid metal tamper.You'll love this thing."
2,Tried Two and Gave Up,"We were among those who had to wait quite a while for delivery on this machine. I'd have given it one star but the taste of the coffee was delicious. When the first unit arrived, we were impressed by the weight and build quality of the unit itself. Within two days, the Portafilter began a slow leak, the next cup a major leak and within the next few cups it blew off and spewed hot water everywhere. Amazon quickly shipped a replacement which, within a few days, began leaking in the same manner. It never flew the portafilter across the room but did get worse over time. It's a shame because this machine made better coffee than the Saeco or Breville machines we also tried. I gave up and got a Gaggia. So far so good with the Gaggia!"
1,consider yourself warned,"I ordered my machine on 18 November and received it shortly after. It wasn't used right away due to the kitchen renovation in progress. I started using it during Christmas and it seemed to be working OK. It looked beautiful in my new ultra modern kitchen. Today in the middle of brewing my cup of morning espresso water started oozing from all over the machine. I contacted Amazon's customer service asking for replacement and was advised that because it is over 30 days since I got the machine there is nothing that they can do and I need to contact manufacturer directly, but they don't have any contact information for them. I think this machine is made in China. I don't recommend this product.Can anyone help to find to contact for the manufacturer?Other than two books this was my first big product purchased on Amazon.As of today also my last."
2,Would not buy this machine!,"I have had this maching for over a month now and it will explode the grounds all over me and the kitchen with no warning. No matter what I do it still happens, not every time but enough that I am tired of it."
5,Espresso Review,"Excellent construction. Great support. Thermoblock benefits from prewarming. Use slightly coarser grinding. Reinsert water holder if needed, very fussy can cause pumping failure. Follow manual and check for water transfer before use. This is not a $600 DOUBLE BOILER, but it allows entry to true espresso at an amazing cost. Don't be afraid to spend the $100 on a Baratz Grinder. Get English manual on web."
3,Looks Great But Couldn't Get It To Work,Loved the look of the machine but could not secure the ground coffee holder in the unit. Decided not to persevere with the same model and will order another brand.
4,espresso,"Overall, it is a decent espresso maker for the right price. It does take some practice to get good at making a perfect espresso, so don't expect to have a great drink on your first try."
4,Love this machine,I ordered this machine about six weeks ago and I am crazy about it. It's my first pressure espresso machine and I hope that it keeps running for a long time. Maybe some of the other people who have reviewed it on this page have a lot more high-flying taste than I do. All I know is that it makes great espresso with a beautiful crema on top most every time and seems to be very well made.
3,Good while it lasted,"It was good while it lasted. I used it about twice a day for almost six months. I figure all in all I got 300-350 espressos out of it before the pump pretty much quit. It still makes a lot of noise and sputters a bit but just can't create the pressure any longer. So is it worth it? Actually I am still giving it three stars. I figure mine lasted for a shorter period than most but even if most last for about a year, for $100-$120 (free shipping with Prime) that comes out to about 30 cents per shot each morning. At $2.00 per Espresso con Panna at the local Starbucks it paid for itself in a month. So within 6 months I do think it is a bit disposable but still worth it...just consider I am not alone.And no, I did not consider sending back. It is made in China and no local repair firm. I opened it and see no way to replace the pump myself. The thing weighs about 20# so shipping back when shipping a new one was free with Prime is just not worth it. So go ahead but buyer beware."
4,Where did the filter holder go?,"Purchased the Espresso maker a month ago. It has been working well, with one exception: the filter holder tends to come off (while the machine is pumping coffee) if it is not tightened to the max, even though the instruction warns you not to over tighten! Imagine the mess, when the coffee grounds collide with the kitchen cabinet. Now I tend to over tighten, with good results.The unit itself is a fine piece of machinery. It is heavy, sturdy, and looks good. The coffee it brews is very tasty!"
1,espresso TOY!,"pay the extra money for something else, this is just a cute espresso TOY, we got it replaced, and it broke AGAIN, the Itailian company is just unresponsive and they can care less about US customers...They know they are far away and so will be your $ spent on this toy"
4,Work Horse,"Evey day, I get up, fire up the Ariete and make a cap or latte. It works awesome every time. Smooth running, great steam ( after a few seconds ) and the pump is so strong I have to lower the amount of time for my shots to be pulled. ( 20 sec now for a double)otherwise there is too much. ( Yes I tamp it very hard, I'm a big boy)It's solid and looks good. The only dings I can think of are that the knob that handles the steam/coffee is getting hard to turn, I think some smaller or older women might have trouble with that part of the brew process."
5,Excellent espresso machine,"The lello ariete espresso maker seems to be an excellent entry level espresso machine for the coffee fanatic. The unit makes excellent espresso with no fuss at all and once the machine is warm, you can just make shot after shot. One important thing to note is that your coffee must not be powdered too fine. This means the pump will struggle to push the water through the coffee. The frother in addition works wonders, I drink a couple of lattes everyday and this baby will recoup its investment in 20 days especially with latte prices being 3.50 a pop at most coffee shops"
4,Worth the price if want to upgrade in a few years.,"Ok, so i think i have already written a review of this product before but feel i should write another as my machine has final started rusting. Now i have had this machine for nearly 3 years now and i love it. However here are the reasons that i will be replacing it after 3 years of loyal service.1) the steaming rod is now rusting2) the drip tray plating has worn enough away that i don't want to touch it anymore. (FYI this problem started within 3 months of my first use)and yes, i understand that this is very likely MY FAULT, but nun the less it is done.I love this product and have recommended it to my friends on dozens of occasions. I am now looking for a new one and will most likely buy another of these."
4,Reliable machine for 2 years,"After using the Ariete Cafe Prestige daily for 2 years it finally conked out. I must say that I made some really great espresso drinks for those two years. I have had 3 other machines prior to this one but it has been the best. I researched buying a different machine to replace it but finally decided to get the same one again. For the price I would say it is a good investment. This time I am alo buying the Lello bur grinder as well. I considered another one with a timer, built in grinder and a few other perks for nearly 3X as much. But decided I would be really bumbed if it broke after 2 years.It is true you need to wait at least 10-15 minutes for it to warm up and get the best crema. The steamer wand needs to be clean to get good foam. I found a pokey thing under the water container that works to clean the steamer wand and the basket holes. Wish I found it earlier.Lello 1375 Ariete Cafe Prestige Coffee Maker"
5,Great at this price point!,"I am back for my second machine! We purchased this espresso machine 18 months ago and it just stopped working this morning so we ordered another one. Like my husband says, for the price it isn't worth trying to fix it and we went for another one because I make ALOT of coffee and this machine worked and worked and worked. Is it the best on the market? Probably not. Is it the sexiest? No. It is an excellent, basic workhorse of a machine."
3,Good but has faults,"Fairly good at brewing espresso. Does not have enough pressure to handle well finely ground coffee.A major defect: the inside of the dripping pan has a lousy chrome layer and corrodes very fast. I would recommend coating it with some protective layer when new.A couple of other recommendations: if you want to steam milk, first let the steam eject the water in the system, otherwise you will be adding several tablespoons of water to your milk.Unless your coffee is ground fairly coarse, wait a minute or so before removing the pod after you finished brewing your cup, otherwise the accumulated pressure will have not yet dissipated and will send coffee grinds flying...And the first time you use the machine, make sure to read and follow the instructions on how to prime the pump.As other reviewers mentioned, the pump is noisy. It does not bother me.All in all the machine does its job. but the chrome issue with the pan is a problem"
1,"Super Looking Cruddy Performance, Sending it Back","Looks great but the pump totally strained to produce a bogus amount of steam. Sending it back, and Amazon crediting the shipping, so that's nice. Back to the trusty DeLonghi that we had before..."
1,Very unhappy!,"I ordered this on my birthday with hopes that I'll get this machine sometime in August, but the shipment date was pushed THREE times - and I may not get it until middle of December. As of today, I decided to cancel this, and ordered Krups instead. I am so disappointed. If Amazon advertise this with a great deal, and cannot deliver products - really gives out a very bitter aftertaste of all!Amazon, I hope you sincerely understand that the customer service is a paramount importance to keep your customers satisfied, not putting them off. I truly feel that we SHOULD be compensated with this unnecessary wait! You may want to consider giving us vouchers for who had suffered unrealistic delays!Disgruntled customer"
1,A very long wait,"I waited and waited since August and still no deliveryNow I have heard that it will be delivered in December!I bought a great Briel, will have it this week"
1,JUNK,GOT IT HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.WE OPENED IT AND THE POOR PACKING DAMAGED THE MACHINE.YOU GOT ONE TIME TO IMPRESS ME AND THEN YOUR OUT OF LUCK MISTER.
4,Lello espresso,Amazon has failed to deliver this item for 4 months!!No reason - they just keep advertising it as available and then for a July 4th Order they keep setting back the shipping date!! Very disappointing!!
1,Very disappointed by Ariete,"I am Italian and I thought Ariete was a good brand for an espresso coffee maker. I couldn't be more wrong. The Cafe Prestige machine we bought few months ago is quiet loud (the water reservoir and its lid vibrate loudly) and the ""non"" stainless steel tray got rusty after one week we start using it. By now the tray is horribly ruined. There is no way in USA to have a tray replacement and also in Italy (we tried through the help of my parents) is extremely difficult. I would not suggest to anyone to buy such coffee maker"
4,Good machine for the price,"I've had this machine for about a month. I am a novice, so I don't have a point of comparison. That said, I'm happy with the machine for the money I spent on it. You should note 1. The machine comes with instructions on how to use the machine, but it does not give recipes. So if you don't know how to make your favorite drink, you'll have learn somewhere else. 2. As a novice, I didn't think it was necessary to buy a frothing pitcher or carafe. This machine comes with neither. You'll need to buy them.While it could be user error since I am a novice, I do have problems sometimes getting a good froth. The frothing wand won't work properly if the tray is not emptied and the wand is not completely cleaned between cups. Even if it is just a few minutes between cups. I've also noticed the longer I let the machine heat up, the better froth I am able to obtain.This machine does make very good coffee drinks. I would buy it again."
2,Good maker with exception of filters,"The coffee maker is pretty good. However the filters get plugged very easily, and I had to buy 3 replacements so far. And now they have double the price of replacement parts!!! i used to buy the filter for $8 and now it is $16 plus shipping. this is getting worse than the maintenance in my BMW!!!. I downgraded the product to 2 stars because their expensive replacement parts."
2,Not the best buy,Pump went out after a year. Never did get the type of pressure needed for good espresso. Looked nice but would not recommend.
5,I Use I Every Morning,"I have owned this machine for six months now and have absolutely nothing but good things to say about it. I used to own a restaurant and had an industrial Espresso machine that cost close to $4000. As it should have, it produced great espresso with heavy crema. The Lello Ariete 1375 does the job just as well. If I gave you a blind test, you would have trouble telling the difference. I did my homework before buying and have used it every morning without a hiccup. For the price, I believe it is the best in its class. I shouldn't be saying these things because I will probably have to replace it someday and all these great reviews are going to drive up the price."
4,Great for Lattes,"We bought this for the purpose of making lattes. I was a little skeptical about the quality of the lattes we would get, because certain specialty foods taste better in the restaurant rather than at home. This coffee maker is awesome. The milk frother is especially good. It is easy to clean and works pretty quickly. I would highly recommend it."
1,Sorry I never got it,"The product looks great on line, and the original reviews were good for such a low cost item but pushing back the delivery date again without an explanation is unexceptable. Expanding your product range beyond your feild of expertise? I'll keep ordering DVD's and books from Amazon, because they do that well."
1,Mystery,"Gee, it's kinda hard to rate a product that never seems to appear. I can, though, rate Amazon's customer service as it relates to this product. Oh, how I wish I could rate this a zero."
4,Reliable pump espresso,"I have had this machine for 2 years and it just keeps working. I use it all the time, and it never stops.One thing that is not good is the drip tray, it's the worst material ever made, within a month it was rusting or breaking down, at the 2 year mark it looks, well gross. but the internals keep churning out espresso, so for the price not bad....I contacted the company to see if I could get a relacement tray, no dice....no reply. Nada..."
1,"Did'nt pump, waiting for replacement since June...","I read the glowing reviews and purchased this item as a birthday gift in early June. Item arrived,looked really great (stainless steel and all), but would not pump water. We tried to contact Lello, and did not get any reply. So we asked Amazon to replace this and we've been waiting and waiting.... I have contacted Amazon customer service umpteen times and have been amazed by their inability to find out anything more than what is listed on their web site. They will not even send an enquiry out to their supply department and get back to let me know if the item will be available before xmas. What kind of service is that!"
4,Great Value; Makes Great Espresso!,"I have owned this machine for two years now. It was and still is a great value and makes a great cup of espresso. I beleive the same machine is being sold under the Cuisineart name for 2x the price. Here are my some ""long term"" review/observations:1) For reliable operation, buy and useLello 45800/3006 Ariete Burr Coffee Grinder. Set the Grind level to the finest setting.2) Clean the drip tray after EVERY USE. Although the drip tray feels solid, its chrome platting forms bubbles when the water sits on it for a while.I use this machine for my daily morning double-shot espresso and totally love it. I obviously highly recommend this product."
2,Leaky Water Basket,"I had purchased one of these makers for my father last Christmas and it really worked well. So I am giving this maker 2 stars in sympathy for my dad's maker which was awesome. Unfortunately though, Lello seems to have a quality problem. My water basket started leaking the minute is was filled and will not work. It looks like they use multiple parts in the water basket rather than one moulded part and the product leaks along the part assembly points. The Mechanical Engineer who reviewed this should be shot. If they get this fixed, it will be an awesome product."
5,Build quality A+,"I cannot believe the high quality of this espresso maker, especially considering the price. The entire lower drip tray is removable and very easy to clean. Following are my observations after 1 month:1. Do not pack the coffee in the portafilter on this unit; just tamp it lightly. It does include a plastic scoop/tamper.2. The portafilter lock handle moves further right than most units; some people have had problems by not locking the handle all the way.3. I had a hard time priming the pump when I first got it, but after that it was ok. You need to have the portafilter installed when priming the pump.4. I haven't been able to froth milk with the steamer in a timely manner; I preheat milk in the microwave to save time."
1,"EXPLODES in your face, BE AWARE","This thing EXPLODED in my face in this morning guys. Be aware....I've read all over the internet about this problem. I've done everything by the book and just EXPLODED in my face.I will post pictures very soon. Burned my hand and the glass cut my hand in few places.My lawyer will be talking to Amazon first thing Monday morning. This is totaly CRAZY.....DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK, PERIOD.Ethan"
2,Ok but not the best,"I've had the machine for 3 weeks now. I use it for Expresso/Capuccino several times a day; coffee tastes fine, but nothing more than my $39.00 machine tasted. It's too noisy when coffee pours, and sometimes machine won't process until cooled from the last batch. Has large water storage, but only makes 2 cups of expresso/capuccino at a time. I would not buy this machine again."
1,Not worth the trouble,"Not impressed, looks well constructed (for made in china) but it makes lousy coffee. The machine seems to put too much pressure through the coffee and after the first ounce or two of coffee its dishwater colored coffee."
1,"Terrible experience, do not buy!!!","I ordered two (!) of these as a gift for Christmas - the first arrived with the back part of the machine completely broken off. I exchanged it for the same machine; when that one arrived it didn't work. It would turn on, and then nothing. AT ALL. Now I have to return it and my gift recipient still has no gift."
3,Missing pin,The box says there is a special Pin Device enclosed to remove blockages from the basket. I don't have any Pin Device enclosed and I can't seem to find any Customer Service at Amazon or Lello to address this. Suggestions?
5,Very Pleased!,"Excellent product. Great deal...it's built very sturdy of all stainless with the exception of the water tank located on the back. Ease of use and works great! The frothing/steam function is outstanding. I'd say that similar machines you would pay more by the hundreds. No complaints at all and have been using it a lot. Highly suggest the purchase of the double insulated shot glasses, stainless pitcher and frothing thermo -- I'm glad I did."
3,"Great espresso, poor steam","I have had this machine 6 months, the steam pressure has always been poor and now it's getting worse. Makes great espresso as long as you do not want steamed milk"
4,Italian Design :o) / Chinese Manufacture :o(,I've had this since Nov 2007 & functionally its performed well but am forced now to contact the Ariete HQ in Italy seeking a Part No 14 replacement drip tray. The metallic non-stainless finish (beneath the perforated stainless removable deck) begain corroding on the inside corners within the first two months & has progressed to a point that it literally appears to be an active chemical reaction. Subsequent steam releases are slowly working their way on six or seven areas. I now worry whether the internal parts might also be of suspect (read : CHINA) manufacture.
1,Disappointment,"We bought this espresso machine about three months ago from Amazon. This past month we have already started having problems with it. We spent the money to invest in a decent machine and have been left disappointed. The machine some times works and some times does not. It is like it is having trouble getting the water up to the point where it comes out through the grind. Very frustrating, I would advise against this product. If I were you I would take the time to go into an appliance shop and get a warranty on a real product from a store. Something like this, an appliance that we need to rely on every day, needs to work."
2,Wrong filter holder,"The machines come with the wrong filter head. You have to turn the handle 45 degrees past the ""lock"" marks on the front of the machine to actually lock it in place, which results in the pour spouts being 45 at a degrees angle. If you don't turn the handle until it is fully locked, the basket might blow off when brewing (this happened to me). This is dangerous. You could be burned. Does anyone have one that actually locks in place with the handle aligned with the ""lock"" marks on the unit? (It is locked when you cannot turn it any farther with normal effort)."
1,"No warranty, missing parts, and ... explodes","Well, that about does it for me. What garbage, and after a 5 month wait.For starters there is no warranty included in the packaging, so you're stuck with a $100 mistake if it breaks.And what brand is this again? It's advertised as a Lello ""45900"" but is actually an Ariete ""1375"". What's with that? Good luck tracking down the real manufacturer if you have a problem.Mine is missing the filter lock, and both filters are defective, which I learned the hard way -- The filter holder literally exploded off the machine and smashed two nearby glasses due to the pressure. The filter holes don't go all the way through.Back it goes."
2,Loud and messy,My machine did not come with the lock that goes on the filter which would have been great. The machine is vibrates so much that it would unscrew the filter while operating. I think if this machine was more quiet and reliable I would have kept it. When I got it to work correctly the coffee it produced was great.
1,worked once..,worked once.. never heated again.. sent it right back (amazon returns are easy) .. bought a different one which happened to be cheaper and still works..
2,Okay - for the first year.,"I purchased this machine in 2006. For the first year, everything worked well. I maintain my machines well, using cleaning tablets and clearing out the portafilter regularly. Almost immediately after the warranty expired (!), the amount of steam for milk frothing decreased by about 50%, despite cleaning. Shortly afterward, the steam started coming out near the junction of the machine and the wand. Water flows freely between the top and bottom of the disconnected wand, but no steam passes throgh. Then the rubber ring gave out, so it won't even produce coffee. I guess I can't expect much for this price, but...I do."
3,"Some useful advice, I hope","I just received my replacement machine - the first one didn't pump and had to be returned - and I made my first cup of cappucino. The replacement is not too bad - it actually makes coffee so I am satisfied. I can't see any product support provisions in the little pamphlet that I found in the box so... like my previous machine, it will work until it breaks. That one, a more expensive brand, lasted for 3 or 4 years.Now, 2 tips for the beginners:- If the machine makes A LOT of noise, it's probably because the water tank is not well inserted. Push it down and the the vibrations will diminish.- One reviewer complained that the filter holes were not completely 'punched through'. I know, it's hard to believe, but all you need in the filter is ONE tiny hole so if you only see one hole, it is not a defect.I had to subtract one star because the first unit was defective and then subtract another one because there seems to be no warranty or support information."
1,Faulty product & very bad response from AMAZON & Lello,"I bought this espresso maker as a gift, which makes the experience with it all the worse. It leaks! It begin leaking almost immediately!! The person I gave it to could not find a way to return it for repair, and had to contact me. I contacted AMAZON, who offered me little assistance other than to say they would return 75% of the cost to me. I eventually got an address for the manufacturer, Lello, and asked my friend to mail it in with a description of the problem. She did. It was returned a month later with the same problem. No solution. No substitution. No fix. Why AMAZON is still selling this product is a mystery to me. I lost a lot of respect for the company as a result of this purchase."
1,Works great until it breaks,"Looks great, and worked fine for me as a casual, intermittent user (about once every two weekends). After 18 months of intermittent use, it inexplicably stopped heating the water. Now I just get cold water to the brew basket, and cold water getting squirted out of the steam nozzle. Now it's just a heavy block of useless metal. I'd imagine if I had used it on a daily basis, it would have broken much sooner -- perhaps within the 1-year warranty period, but from reading other reviews, it sounds like their warranty service is poor."
2,"Pretty, but...","I bought this based upon looks - bad idea. It works okay and the water storage reservoir is nice, but...the bowl is too small and it seems to take longer to get good steam going. It is now sitting next to a cheaper Krups model."
4,Excellent unit for the price,"I bought the unit about 2 months ago and have been very happy with the performance...particularly for the price. The unit is well made, study and relatively easy to operate. I agree with other reviews that the instructions are not very complete, however, operation is fairly simple. My only complaint with the system is that the operation lights are not very reliable. Both the power and ready lights turn on whenever the unit is first turned on, rather than when the unit is warmed up. Again, this is not a rocket science project....waiting a few minutes until the cups are warm is more than ample time to ensure the pressure is at the proper level. I'd buy this unit again for a friend!"
1,Work well for a year,"This machine worked well for a little more than a year, we did not use it much, then it, all of a sudden, starting making the pumping sound that it does for steam or froth whenever it was turned on and the dial at ""o"". It also started leaking water into the tray until the tray overflowed. I sent muntiple e-mails to Ariete without any response."
1,It broke after only six months!!!! And the customer service is really bad,I owned this machine for six months and now the steam pump is broken!!!I called the customer service and they were very unpolite......so my suggestion is do not buy from this company if you don't want to have problem after only six months of usage!!!!
1,Product only lasted for 10 months.,"Like so many other reviews here, my machine exploded after 10 month. I only made 2 cups of coffee per day in that time. I only used filtered water and cleaned it according to the instructions.It could never steam milk without making it very watery, however I was aware that cheap espresso machines rarely froth milk satisfactorily. I take my coffee with cold milk anyway.The manner in which it exploded could have resulted in an injury. I cannot recommend this machine at all."
5,outstanding value! easy to use,"I bought this item because I am an extreme coffee drinker and love cappuccino. Right out of the box I noted the heavy construction and beautiful chrome finish. Easy to fill removable reservoir holds more than enough water. Quick heating, was ready to go in no time. Selector is simple; to the left you make froth, to the right you make espresso, and in the center it just holds the steam. At this price, it's a no brainer"
4,VERY nice!,"This is the nicest espresso and cappuccino maker I've had. The cup warmer on the top really comes in handy! You have to make sure that the ground-holder is securely in place, though. If not, it will shoot straight off the machine and splatter hot grounds and water everywhere!"
4,Ariete Espresso Maker,"I recently ""upgraded"" from a steam cappuccino maker to the Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker after having compared a variety of products. I am very pleased with the performance of the Ariete. Specifically, I wanted a machine that would make great espresso. I was excited to observe the crema produced by the Ariete and the flavor is great. This product is a bargain that delivers."
5,Best inexpensive coffee maker!,"I purchased this espresso machine when one of two of our small espresso machines broke. After visiting the Netherlands we had to buy two espresso machines, one for each of us. With this one, I was able to put away the one that was working and saved us counter space. This esspresso machine makes wonderful coffee, I haven't used the milk steamer because it creates a nice creamy froth by itself. It is so easy to keep clean and there is always water in the machine for quick use. When it breaks, I will purchase anothe one! Five star product in my book!"
4,Very nice machine,"A very nice espresso-cappuccino maker, especially for the price! It makes a perfect cup of espresso or foamed milk cappuccino just as well as machines costing hundreds of dollars more. It delivers espresso and steam instantly on demand. My only two complaints - tiny ones that I can easily live with - are 1) that there is no automatic one- or two-cup setting for amount of steam/water dispensed (in other words, you have to stand there to let it fill your cup to the desired level, then manually turn the knob off), and 2) the soft rubber cover for the steam spout, which gets quite messy when foaming milk."
3,OK output for the price,"I purchased this coffee maker after reading some customer reviews about it. Shipping was very prompt and I received product in 2 days, but it had a broken water tank. I returned the defective product and Amazon was great in sending a new product to me in a short time. Ariete makes decent cup of coffee. The pump starts slow and adds water to the milk before it starts frothing."
2,looks and feels great but....,"Great sturdy weight, great looks, trim profile BUT I have returned two, back to back Ariete Machines because of the same problem: the filtetrs are NOT machined even close to sufficiency. The ONE pin-point hole does not allow water/coffe to filter thru, hence puddling for 3-5 minutes. This is a serious defect in this line....Amazon has been alerted and other customers have run into the same mechanical defect but (defective) replacement machines are still being shipped out to folks. My advice: Do NOT order this until Amazon clears all current stock."
1,"Metal corrodes, I'm worried about my health!","I was initially pleased with the Ariete Cafe Prestige, until the inside of the bottom metal tray started corroding. It has bubbled and bulged and corroded in such a manner that I began to wonder if the same is not happening elsewhere inside the machine, putting tiny hard metal fragments in my coffee. I'll be tossing this and getting another brand."
2,Quit after a week,"I bought this as my first true espresso machine after using drip coffee makers for years. I didn't want to overspend without knowing whether I could really make espresso or not. After doing my research on coffeegeek, I decided that the Ariete would be a decent compromise between price and quality. Long story short, it died after five days (about 15 shots or so).It makes a decent shot and warmed up quickly. I was quite impressed with the looks of the machine and how quickly it warmed up and was ready to pull a shot.I never got the chance to replace the pressurized portafilter with an non pressurized version but that was the next step I was going to take before the machine quit working.Despite my bad experience with the machine itself, Amazon did a fantastic job of taking care of the return, customer service get a A+"
3,Leaked like a sieve,"I was very impressed with the look and it made great espresso the 5 or 6 times it was used. I am used to a Rancillo and it doesn't compare, but for the money, it was great.....but it leaked 2/3 of the reservoir onto the counter top over night after using it for 4 days. I am sending it back and Amazon is awesomely easy to do that with. I am hopeful that the replacement won't leak ever. Hope does spring eternal in me though!"
1,"Rusted, leaked in a few weeks.","Terrible machine. The trace got rusted in a few weeks. Water leaks under the trace. Filed a complaint, got brand new machine but it has same problems."
2,Did not like it,"As a huge fan of early Philip Glass, I was anticipating wonderful things when I bought this album.It disappointed me greatly, though. The organic tone of the Farfisa organs was gone, replaced by a very cheesy plastic dull sounding FM synthesis keyboard sound.And the compositions seemed to be rehashes of the earlier Glass idioms.I ended up getting rid of this album, after trying a few more times to get into it.And that's pretty sad (compare to my favorite Glass albums -- including ""Music in 12 Parts"", ""Einstein on the Beach"", ""North Star"", ""Akhnaten"", ""Satyagraha"", ""Dance Pieces"", ""The Photographer"")"
3,Esoteria. Not for the faint of heart.,"This is a science-fiction score ala Philip Glass. A commissioned piece, it has some mimimalism to it and a reoccuring theme. Features Linda Ronstadt on howl. Definately not mood music, unless your in the mood to orbit a faraway planet."
2,Disappointed with Amazon product!,"I wanted a Mah Jongg set that would be easy to carry from place to place. It is more cumbersome than I expected. Openings on the sides of the carrying case do not allow for secure carry. Racks for the tiles are too short to build a wall; tiles are too wide to fit on the rack. The set-up is awkward. The price is right; however, the set is not."
1,not satisfactory,"i try to return the item and emailed the mechandizer thru amazon and send a couple of messages, they reply the will come back to me and send a copy to the seller but to no avail. I found it hard to return or exchange an item purchased so be very careful on what you have ordered. about the item i'm not satisfied with it."
4,I really liked it,"If the names of the authors don't mean anything to you i would be surprised you found it to begin with. This is not perhaps the best comic book i have ever read, but it keeps a nice pace and its intriguing on its approach. Buy it and see for yourself why this guys are two fo the best on the comic world."
5,RhinoPak 1100 perfect for iPaq 3650!!,"I wanted a case I could hang on my belt like I do my Palm. This case fits the iPaq 3650 perfectly (with or without the Expansion Pack attached) and has a nice nylon belt loop with a snap for easy on/off. I like it better than my Palm case because the Palm belt case has a metal clip that damages my belt. I've even started to carry my Palm IIIx in this case when I carry it (I'm using it less as I transition to the iPaq.) I also like the zippers better than the Velcro on my Palm case. There are internal pockets that I'm hoping will carry CompactFlash card(s) when I get them. I tried the RhinoPak 2000 which also has a belt loop, but that case, while nice, was too big for my purposes, and not professional-looking enough for me. The padding and protection in the 1100 are good, and this case is a winner, in my judgement."
1,RhinoPack 2000 is like a purse,"The RhinoPack 2000 is too big to put on your belt. It is not confortable to walk or sit while the it is hanging on your belt. Furthermore, the straps inside does NOT hold my Jornada firmly in place. It's too big. If you don't open it carefully, your device may fall out. I carried it two days to work and it ended up in the trash can."
5,supercase,Case is well constructed. Padded for protection with a tough nylon covering. I use for everyday office and travel. Highly recommended. Place also to sore credit cards and cash.
4,Works just fine for my Jornada,"I find the RhinoPack 2000 works good for me, but I don't use the elastic straps to hold my Jornada in it. I put a piece of velcro (the plastic hook part) on the PPC and use that to help hold it against the soft lining fabric of the case. If I have to carry a lot of things, I put the PPC in the mesh pocket on the front. It holds the PPC, modem, memory cards, A/C adapter, AND a Stowaway keyboard, with room to spare. I'd recommend it to anyone who plans to travel with their PPC, and NOT needing to walk around with it on their belt."
2,"a sloppy, unsafe product for your Visor and keyboard","This is a bad product, but I bought it because I thought I needed a large case for my Visor and Keyboard, which I use a lot. I should have paid attention to the other bad reviews. This is an unsafe case.For starters, your PDA won't stay in there, unless it's somehow modified with the use of velcro. They could just as well leave those limp little bunge straps out of there, because they are useless.On the outside, it has all sorts of clips, loops and whatever that serve no useful purpose.The only thing that makes in marginally adequate, is that it can hold an enormous amount of stuff. But God forbid if you open it, all your precious stuff will fall out.,Yuck.If you need a good case, by the Handspring Folio module case, for the same price."
2,Good Case - Bad clip holder,"The case is exelent for keeping my Jornada HP. It get very well hold to the case by the Velcro. The bad news is that the clip holder to the belt is to weak, made of a fragile plastic that tears appart very easily. The center button, of the holder break appart very soon. I recomend to manufacter to review this design."
2,Poor Quality,"After 4 days use, I have to agree with criticsms seen elsewhere about the elastic straps used to hold the PDA in place. With a Jornada 568, and with the screen cover attached, the straps quickly become ""stretched and sloppy"". Who wants to use velcro patches on the battery pack. This product needs a serious re-design!The Rhino 1100 will make a handy accesory case, but I wouldn't trust an [expensive] device in it. GripGear Designs makes a superior case, although it is 1.5X the price."
2,A pretty BIG disappointment,"In short - too big and too flimsy to really be considered adequate.I read lots of reviews on this case ..., both positive and negative, and took the plunge and bought the Rhino 3000 PDA case. There are better options for the same price (see the Handspring folio module case).The main gripe - it does not hold your PDA safely. In fact, nothing is safe from falling out once you unzip it. Every time I open it - I have pens, batteries, PDA's falling out. I will say this - the keyboard stays in pretty good.On the positive side - it is a huge case and holds lots of stuff. I could even stick my phone on the side pocket and carry a PDA, keyboard, phone and a bunch of other stuff.But it's not worth it - not when there are other cases out there for the same price.And what about all those hooks 'n stuff on the outside. What are they for?Beware. There are better cases out there if you have to carrying a keyboard with your PDA. Sorry Rhinoskin . . ."
1,Its JUNK!,"I bought this case after reading it was highly recommended for Compaq iPAQ's, its a complete rip off in that respect. Any case so poorly designed as to allow your $500 unit to fall out when you open it should be recalled. The straps that are supposed to hold the pocket PC in place are a complete joke, any moron can see that. As a consumer I rely upon a fair and resonable evaluation by a reviewer. Task #1 is what? Holding the unit in place right! This case is so poorly designed it actually increases your chances of damaging your Pocket PC. Added salt in the wound is the price, as complete a rip off as I have seen in a long while."
2,Expensive-Not all its cracked up to be.,"I've used my RhinoPack 2000 for an iPAQ, a Cassiopeia and a Visor Prism. In each case the secure straps did not safely secure my handheld. Ultimately, I sewed the straps closer to the center and it works much better. However, imagine having to pay forty bucks and then needing to have sewing skills! As for the rest of the RhinoPack 2000 its storage capacity is somewhat minimal and it is bulky for everyday use. It's best use was in my suitcase on vacation."
1,Doesn't work for PocketPC devices!,"I had read that this cover works well with the iPaq PocketPC computer, and bought it on that recomendation. Althought the case itself seems solid enough, it is worthless as a iPaq cover. The elastic strips are too loose, and it was very easy for the device to fall out when opening the case. Having any of the iPaq jackets on doesn't make any difference. The same was true for a friend's Jornado device: he tried it when I was trying to get rid of it. Don't buy this product if you are looking for a PocketPC case!"
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"In theory, I really liked the idea of this PDA case. Pleanty of room for your cell phone, modem card, cables, PDA, Pens, Paper, Keys, etc. When I actually received the case however, I found there was really no way to securely fasten my iPAQ except with the included rubber band straps. To hold the PDA even semi-securely you need to pass the bands over the top of the screen making it ineffective to use unless you remove the PDA from the case. This defeats the purpose for me. The photo's are deceiving! I finially purchased some industrial strength Velcro to attach it to the left side. The rest of the case features I really like, however, if it wasn't for Velcro, I would have returned this product."
1,It's my fault...,"...I mean, I read the reviews of the disappointed customers, but I bought it anyway. This PDA ""protector"" it's not bad at all, but i can't believe that I paid over US$ 20 for that! I'm pretty sure that here in Lima you can find something of that quality for less of the half of the RhinoPak 1100. I'm not angry with you, people of RhinoSkin, I'm angry with me for believing in you."
3,Grindhouse euro-rape revenge film!,"This was actually good and not as chesey as i thought it would be. Great sleazy film, about a nun who takes revenge on these men that assault her students at a beach-house. This film also is known as THE LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH!"
2,A socerer's-apprentice of a book,"In this four-volume soap opera (begin anywhere, but you're committed to the end), Mr. Wolfe appears to have studied the techniques of the Great Masters, and studied well: his hard-science toys approach the best of Niven, his horror crawls up your spine like Lovecraft, his generation-ship echoes Clark. He seems to have chosen a poor master for his religeon work (Hubbard, perhaps?), his feminism could use a quick LeGuin refresher, and his politics ... well, perhaps he had to skip his Herbert class - but no one can be expected to master everything. His personal contribution, however, is only a rather incomplete paste-up of these studied touches into a not-quite connected narrative which never quite announces its point, nor ever seems to feel it's been reached."
5,I got mine today...I love 'em!,they fit great. they feel great. i'm so happy with these boots. lets see if they last a year or more. very happy with this purchase. they feel so good walking around in them outside. they seem to be a good quality rain boot to me. the price was good also. i wear size 10 shoes. i bought size 11 boots and they fit perfectly. i wear boots alot and i really feel good walking around in these. i spend alot of time outside too. i hope this helps anyone on the size. i put at least 8 hours a day of ware on these boots.update nov 23 2011: i had to go up to size 12 because my left foot swells up so much. size 12 feels wonderful. what a relief. i am still very happy with the boots.
3,Boots Too Tight,"Although they were too tight around the ankles for me, they were well made and thick. Would have been perfect in the cold and snow."
2,Does not last long,"I got these for my ranch. Liked when I first got, but it sprung a leak and they are only 3 months old ! not happy about this and will not buy this brand again !"
4,WAY TOO BIG but good for the price,"I ordered these for my husband, so he wouldn't destroy another pair of sneakers in the mud at the dog park this winter, or in the snow. While the boots were made well for the price, they were far too big for him. He has size 11 feet that require wide sized shoes and these boots just slipped off while he walked indoors (even with his thickest pair of socks on), so they wouldn't have functioned at all at the muddy park.I am returning and ordering a size 10 instead, hopefully they will fit. If not, then the sizing is WAY off."
2,Ridiculously Oversized,Seems like good construction - but ridiculously oversized. I ordered one size smaller than I needed and that was still just too big. Had to return them because they weren't really wearable - what a pain.....
2,Chafes my calf,I purchased these to work in hot wet conditions so I wear shorts and a tee shirt while grinding concrete countertops. The surface inside rubs against my calf and burns a raw spot there. I have to stuff cloth inside to prevent chafing.
4,Boots are made for mud and run small,"The boots came with the top ripped. I am using them for the garden so it did not matter and I am not sending back a twenty dollar item that came with free shipping. They are made for wearing with socks. Know that this is a good $20 pair of rubber boots, but not in anyway a quality pair. They are great for what I wanted and well worth the money."
2,Unsure,"When I received this product, it was not quite what the picture entailed. There were quite a few differences. They ran a size and a half roughly too large. Not a huge fan of this product. Not happy with them at all. They've been used once and now are just sitting."
2,Very dissapointed!,"I purchased this boots for same price I would find it at Walmart, but I tjought I would get some better quality..Wrong!I returned this items 3x times, and every time was a manufacturer defect with either left or the right boot. Finnaly I asked for a refund. Anyway, I went to Walmart and I bought a pair of rainy boots made in Canada, good quality for less money.I understand to get it wrong for the first time but 3x times to receive bad products?! I was very dissapointed."
2,"flimsy, weak, and intense smell","it fits perfectly as a size 14. my foot is a size 11 or 12. it smells. it doesn't seem like it will last more than a few months if you do hard work outside. i wouldn't recommend it. but for 19, it's the best deal on amazon.i took off the boots 40 minutes ago. i'm in my room, and i can still smell the boot smell from my leg. it's making me nausea. i got the boots today too."
2,too wide,"Much too wide at the top and too wide at bottom. My foot just swam around in it., It fit more like a size 8. I have even had size 8's that fit better. Guess this is made for a rally wide foot."
1,Misrepresentation,The boots that's are in the picture are not the boots I got when I purchased these.. They run very big and I was very mislead..
5,Nice Boot,The Boot is great but took suggestion of getting larger size and have to return size 10 cause way to big. Husband wears a 9 shoe wide and this size 10 boot did not work out. If wearing with socks by shoe size.
5,Good Value!,Good construction and great value for the $$$$. I would highly recommend them for anyone. Get a size up for padded socks!
3,Rain Boots,"Ordered a size 10, received a size 10. In actuality, they are at least a size 12 or 13. Way too large but not expensive enough to bother with sending back."
1,These boots STINK!,"These boots smelled so bad, I had to get rid of them. The rubber smell is so strong it made the closet they were stored in smell, too."
3,boots,They looked good but were too big so I sent them back. I had bought a different pair at the store so I didn't order another pair.
5,Great value for money!,"Boots fit perfectly and are comfortable to wear. I got them for hiking around the wooded area where we fly RC Model airplanes looking for ""lost"" and stray planes! They keep my feet dry, which is a terrific improvement over the tennis shoes I usually wore!"
3,nice,They are good for keeping your feet dry. Not so comfortable. I had to add a set of in soles to keep my feet hurting.
5,Humidifier Filter HWF65,"This filter is a great filter. It keeps your air moist throughout its use. The more mineral content you have in your water, the shorter the filter life, so use filtered water when possile."
2,2nd Time Handset has quit working,"The phone itself is OK - I agree with some of the flaws others have pointed out but they don't bother me much. However the second of my handsets has now broken / quite working. I thought the first was a fluke; had owned it for several years so just replaced it. I have been using this replacement for less than 6 months and today, after it dropped from a chair onto a soft floor, it quit working again. Yes, I dropped it but seriously, a phone should be made to withstand some minor trauma like this. It's not like it was thrown or fell off a balcony. For $75, I want a little better product!"
4,Nice little portable 2 line,"Fairly simple 2 line handset. Instructions for programming it to the base phone were simple and accoplished in no time. It works well 80-100ft from the base station. Mercifully few buttons- it is after all only a phone. Only deficiency is a lack of backlighting for the keys. I receive a fair number of calls in the wee hours of the night, and cannot see the keys to press line 1 or 2."
4,Satisfied customer,"I have used these tapes in a professional capacity and have no complaints. I used them in a Panasonic camera (DVC30). I don't know if they would work as well on other brands of cameras though. I did get a little video degradation once in a while with these tapes for a few frames of video but I am not sure if was was due to the tape, or the camera, or because I had used other brand of tapes (Sony and JVC) in the camera at intervals.I plan to buy this product again in the future. Can't beat the price!"
4,Muy Buen producto,"El Producto esta excelente, por su precio y calidad. Soy realizador de comerciales y cuando no se usan las tarjetas (p2 card), usamos los tapes, y funcionan como esperamos.Depende la calidad que requieran, es confiable trabajar en ellos. Lo recomiendo."
3,Mixed Bag,"I owned the original vinyl version of this album. While it contains some of OMD's best songs (Telegraph, Of All the Things we've Made, Genetic Engineering, International) and the ok song Silent Running, it also contains some of their worst. The vocals in Radio Waves are painful to listen to and as for the title track Dazzle Ships then you have to wonder ""what were they thinking"". The other tracks are just plain filler tracks and I can't seem to figure out why they thought they were worthy of inclussion. Time Zones is just overlayed recordings of speaking clocks from around the world and Radio Prague is just sound bites from Radio Prague Radio Station (surprisingly enough). Their best album by a long long way, a must have, is the originally titled ""Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark"". This is the album where OMD started to trade off uniqueness for popularity and the later albums just got more and more pop trashy."
3,Turning point,"You decide that the two best songs on this album, the only two good songs, are Romance of the Telescope and Of All the Things We've Made. Then you look at the liner notes and, surprise, these two songs are from 1981, not 1983, as the rest of the album is. Clearly these must have been leftover songs from Architecture and Morality, which was OMD's BEST album. Everything from here on was stunningly weak.Having a hit single wrecked a few bands from this era-Simple Minds, Modern English, OMD. Maybe they made a few extra dollars but at what cost?"
2,an extremely experimental album,"This album is probably the weakest OMD album. There are some solid songs like Genetic Engineering, Telegraph, and Romance of the Telescope. But, there are some songs that are just sound effects. For every good song on this album, there is a bad song to follow it. It seems like some ideas fall short like the Dazzle Ships song, Radio Prague, and Time Zones."
1,This Album Sucks,"I've been an OMD fan for years. I was in middle school when they became famous for ""Forever Live and Die"" and ""So In Love"". I particularly liked the Sugar Tax album. Dazzle Ships is just pure crap. A lot of the lyrics don't even make sense! It's a bunch of techno-garbage with cliche lyrics sprinkled here and there. Don't waste your money. Buy some of their older albums."
4,Merely enjoyable,"""Dazzle Ships"" is certainly not the truly mind-blowing type of album, even for OMD fans, but it remains a still penetrable one, even when OMD's songwriting is stripped at its most and some tapes have struggled in (the short pieces are indeed the funniest). The sound is on the whole digital squeaky clean, but not necessarily that icy, and aiming at making a whole over its pieces gives the album a different kick. What unfortunately makes the album a little flawed is the foreseenability of its longest tracks and the references to already known music -a bass line here, a rhythm pattern there, the ""time zones"" (ever heard ""Pulstar""?)... to be a true masterpiece it wouldn't have needed songs instead of snippets, but some overall polishing."
4,A Little Something Different,"This was OMD's experiment in electronic music. It has the noticeable maritime theme if you glance at the track selections. This album is strange but in a good way. It's very musical in different ways. It has some very strong songs like the two singles ""Genetic Engineering"" and ""Telegraph"" among others like the title track and the best song on the album ""International"" which is mind blowing when you listen to the lyrics. I don't think a lot of people understood this album and that's a shame cause if you're a true music fan like I am, you'd find it ""musically moving""."
3,OMD's Experimental Album,"Even though I was initially dissapointed with Dazzle Ships, it is what it is. It's still Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Genetic Engineering, Telegraph, International, Radio Waves, and of course All the things We've Made are all memorable. Yes, there's a couple of tracks with nothing but radio beeps and boops and the sound of machinery, but hats off to OMD for trying an experimental album, it's the last of their early years...and who wouldn't like the trumpet fanfare of Radio Prague?"
3,Great except narration!,"Derrida was an excellent film, revealing the philosophers consistent way of practicing what he taught in a philosophically nuanced way.Unfortunately the narration of Derrida's written works was so poor it was almost uninteligble. Should have added subtitles for the english narration.But definitely worth stuggling through."
2,Wanting Something More,"I was really excited when I saw trailers for this film but the finished version left me wanting something more. There was no mystery, no build up, nothing to make you want to watch this film to the end. You get to see Derrida going about his daily business, eating, dressing, speaking, walking around various cities, and watching him be interviewed. I had just read some of 'The Truth About Painting' and wanted to learn more about this man and his theory of Deconstruction. But this film wasn't what I was looking for."
2,"Two Worthwhile Scenes, lots of Forgettable Platitudes","Derrida's refusal to be a subject, mentioned by another reviewer, is one of the very few interesting elements of this film. In one of my two favourite scenes, Derrida points out the inherent tension between the viewers' expectations that they are 'seeing Derrida', and the fact that he is not the same when viewed by a camera. My other favourite scene is Derrida's response to question about which philosopher his mother would have been. This was probably the only good question in the whole film. Other than these two scenes, the film is filled with banal shots of Derrida's life that tell us little about Derrida the person and reveal nothing about his intellectual thought."
3,Deconstructing Derrida...not so much,"The documentary was interesting because it is a side of Derrida not present in his works. But, throughout the documentary, I could not help but think that Derrida was merely playing with Kirby and Kirby just didn't get it. From the unanswered questions, the comments and the face impressions, I just thought that Derrida was incredibly bored and yet amused at Kirby. Also, the questions asked by Kirby were too...high school? And too broad.Kirby tries to turn the tables on Derrida and ""deconstruct him"" by showing each of the facets of a man and that he is a man, just like the rest of us. But, the only thing this documentary accomplishes is to show a film crew following Derrida around, trying to make sense of him, and failing miserably."
4,a moment in time,"This documentary is a well-made, thoughtful and ultimately affecting snapshot of Jacques Derrida. The filmmakers follow him through day-to-day situations--both the mundane and the academic. I found the scenes in which selections from his works are read in voiceover to be both lyrical and appropriate to the ""action"" taking place in the film. Those who are expecting ""an Introduction to Derrida""--a film of a series of lectures and seminars which explain or summarize his thought--will be disappointed with this film. This film is much better than that."
3,a playground for deconstruction,"I cant believe this movie brought up the problems with autobiography, then proceeded to construct the most hip, glamourizing image of derrida. ""He lived, he thought, he died."" All along with press following him, images of cameras following him around, and hip, computor-altered narrative voices listing all the ""cool"" parts of his childhood. Sometimes when he actually employs deconstrucionism to the actual interview process and starts to show with the value of getting out of cultural-assumptions, a narrator pops in with some over-simplification. Overall this is a pretty cool movie and makes derrida look really cool, but mostly by attaching a lot of culturally ""cool"" baggage to derrida and not really getting at the kind of honesty that deconstructionism is all about. It seems like the incredible focus on imagery was more important than expressing things honestly. There must have been a lot of money involved."
3,A metamentary...,I like the way this meta-documentary shows Derrida reflecting on the film itself. It shows how hard it would be to produce a stereotypical biography of a philosopher who is still alive. The film would definitely have been nothing like this if Derrida was dead.
1,superficial voyeurism,"this documentary is even worse than expected. the filmmakers/interviewers show little respect for Derrida. for instance, they throw questions too private, such as Derrida's sexual life. this is so embarrassing and rude. they also push Derrida to summarize his philosophy. it is awful, because no philospher is able to, is obligated to summarize her/his own philosophy. we cannot ask them to simplify themselves; we can only hope they become more complicated. i have to say this documentary does Derrida violence. it is so obvious that the filmmakers/interviewers do not prepare themselves with Derrida's works before they make the film, because they keep asking unnecessary, irrelevant, and intrusive questions. i am surprised that Derrida tolerates these filmmakers. but he looks so obviously annoyed and impatient towards the end of the documentary, if you have the heart to finish watching this violent work."
5,What a winner!,"Our 2-year-old twins request this book every night for their bedtime story, it is a great hit and they love the lyrical poems and the great illustrations. I would recommend this for any child and just bought it for all three of our new nephews and niece for Christmas."
4,A tattered favorite at our house,"This book delighted my daughter and me all through her toddlerhood. These poems are clever, fun, and evocative. My only complaints: The spine of the paperback didn't hold up well, and the children in the illustrations are nearly all pale, fair-haired waifs, which may reduce the book's appeal for readers whose world is not pale and fair-haired."
1,Not original recordings,These are not the original recordings we remember and love. These must have been recorded at some concert he did.
1,Don't waste your money or time,"If you're new to John Denver, this is a terrible introduction to his talent and great music. If you're a long-time fan, this is a total disappointment. Every track has the same canned jazzy background that drowns out the vocals and ruins the song. Surely not the way he ever intended his music to sound. Try the Wildlife Concert album (fabulous), or some of the older albums, like An Evening With John Denver. Anything but this."
3,Not original renditions but nice disc anyhow,"1) These are NOT the original hit versions of these tunes. They are re-recordings, probably from the 90s judging from the soft synthesizer padding on certain tracks.2) The sound is excellent despite the low price.3) They're all pretty good songs.BOTTOM LINE:If you're a complete Denver novice, this is a very inexpensive entry point. If you decide you love it, you'll probably want to then invest in a pricier but more inclusive collection featuring the hit renditions and some of the more quality album cut fare."
4,Great CD,"Its the best of John Denver, What else can you say? The case is a bit cheap, but the music is fine...."
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS,"As is pointed out in several other reviews of this CD, the versions of these songs are not the original versions; they are re-recorded studio (NOT live) versions. In my opinion these versions are also noticeably inferior to the originals, & Denver seems very affected/pretentious on several of them."
4,Beautiful recordings!,"If you like John Denver live, buy another album. These songs are studio recordings that are not as raw as his live performances that most are accustomed to hearing. That is not a bad thing. The quality of these recordings is excellent. The music produces a very relaxed atmosphere as everything is smoother and flows better than the live performance albums. It is a very soft, and mellow album. All of the major hits are included and for the price it is an incredible deal.If don't own any John Denver cds, this would make a nice sampler for you to get aquainted with. You then later move on to a more complete collection with the desired live performances if you decide you enjoy his music."
4,Staind are awesome,"This cd is pretty cool.me,a flat and the secret song.The rest of the songs are good but it would be better if their were more soft songs.The singers voice sounds great when he sings soft."
5,great cd!,this is one of the best cds i own. u can go through the entire cd without hitting the skip. and half the song really get u pumped.
5,RAW!,"This is one of the only cd's i own that you can just press play and listen to the whole thing. these guys put bands like limp bizkit to shame, you gotta get this! staind is the best new hardcore band out"
4,FFFFFFAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT!!!,"What can I say? This is nice & Chunky! Fat, Full sound. Dark overtones & Great mix. Buy or Die!"
1,Worst band of all time.,"This is simple these guys are on the list with korn, Limp Bizkit as the worst, most non-talented guys ever to recieve a record deal. I sold this cd back the very next day."
3,Paradox !,"What to say about this band, what is the thing that take it one length over the others ?Except its fabulous voice ... nothing !For me, the only reason to buy this LP is the song Home which is one of the best song ever created with its dark melody and its so pathetic lyrics.In the other side I must admit that several titles seem to be unfinished and too basic. Musically poor, with a crashing sound and too short ( even with its hidden song ) Dysfunction give us only a seamless of what Staind is able to make ( only a great band can be behind a song such as Home ! ).If I had an advice to give to the one who is interrested by this LP : just wait and see !The next way they'll choose will lead them to success or, It's something no one should want, will bury them down in ""unoriginality"", where so many band actually dwell (I'll give no name ! )See You"
5,Staind is one of the most talented rock bands out there,"This CD is a breakthrough in the rock genre. Aaron Lewis has a GREAT voice. Mike Mushok is an EXCELLENT guitarist. This band is very good. Although the lyrics are mostly negative, they sound great. I advise any rock music lover to buy this CD right away. Ignore any review that says that they are horrible. The people who post those reviews don't know what good music is."
5,If you buy only one album this year here it is!!!!!,"I laughed, I cried. This album has everything. Its emotional music with a good hard grinding beat. Fred Durst did not make a mistake in helping these guys to the big time. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!"
5,THIS BAND HAS A BIG FUTURE...,This is one of the best CD's I ever purchased. Fred Durst knows talent when he sees it.
3,Depressing at times-Great moments though,"The singer aaron just has the most annoying, and whiney, and depressing voice, makes ya wanna cry. This cd has 1 great song-Mudshovel-and one pretty good song-just go-i wouldn't say original, but they are better than most of limp bizkit, and deftietly better than kid rock...Go buy a deftones, tool, metallica cd first-then check this out."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm sorry, but this CD is not at all like what the majority of the reviewers made it out to be. It's a decent album, but nothing great. The main problem I had with it is that it was SLOW. When I read that it was heavy, I expected power in the music. All I got was slow drones like Home, Suffocate, Just Go, and most of the rest of the CD. The songs all have heavy intros, but as soon as the guy stars singing, everything slows down. If you're looking for a REAL heavy album, I mean one that's fast and hard, then go for Sevendust:Home, or Static-X."
5,Dysfunction simply rules.,"Dysfunction is an album which rocks. The lead singer has this great voice for transmitting the painful lyrics which the album has. The lyrics are so catchy you may experience points where you start singing along. The sound is somewhat alternative, and it is rooted deeply into hardcore rhythms and dark, deep moods. I can't seem to listen to just one song on the album, because each song is distinctly different, yet slightly connected and blend so well I lose track of time. A definite must for anyone who likes darker moody rock music."
5,Staind rocks! This deserves 6 stars!,"Fred Durst almost turned down Staind when he saw the artwork on Dysfunction, and it's a real good thing that he decided not to. Staind is one of the best new bands out there, and after hearing ""Mudshovel"" and ""Home"", I had to buy the cd. I'm glad I did. Of the nine songs on the cd, each and every one is great rock music. ""Suffocate"" and ""A Flat"" are my two personal favorites. The guitar and bass riffs are tight and the drumming is awesome. And the vocals just add to the hard rock sound of the music, making Staind the best new band out there and Dysfunction a great new cd."
4,"Great, and worth the money!","This album is so amazing! Staind is an awesome band, and I heard about them right when ""Mudshovel"" hit the radio. They are from my area, and their CD proves they really are the best. Aaron's voice is really emotional, yet he can scream too, which is a perfect combination. ""Suffocate"" and ""Raw"" are probably my favorite songs. When you hear it for the first time, be warned that the CD goes from loud to soft a lot, and some people don't like that. There is no song on the CD I don't really like. ""Home"" and ""Me"" are the only soft songs, and those are pretty good too! If you like this CD, I recommend Limp Bizkit's ""Significant Other,"" and anything from KoRn or SlipKnot."
5,Still Love It,"I remember I first bought a copy of this album right here on Amazon.com in 1999'. It was at the time and still is a real good album and one that I love. I love Aaron's voice and the emotion that he shares in his songs something that I would hold close to heart through all the obstracles I had to go through in High School (Family member with cancer, broken heartedness, depression) The music really helped me maintain through the hard times and for that I could never thank Aaron enough for the words he shared. Get this album."
4,where are all the diehards?,"Not one. No reviews. A pity, considering this is Stainds shining moment. But anyone reading this probably likes Staind now. This unfortunately means you probably wouldn't like Staind then."
4,"Aiight, but could have had more tracks","I admit this is a good album, and the band performs very well on their debut...but it could have had more selection for music. Fred Durst from Limp Bizkit was the Co-Producer of this record so there's a clue right there that proves this album is worth buying...but it still lacks total album time with 56:06 as its total time...I figure it like this: if you are going to make an album, make it at your best effort to provide as much music as possible for consumers and music lovers to enjoy. I would still say this cd will blow you away from the minute you pop it into your cd player untill the last shout of Spleen leaves. And following will be an acoustic song written by the lead singer that is alright, but not as much variety as on the rest of the album. Its a very good album...buy it-just don't expect a 70 minute CD...expect a very good album with a little less time than an hour-BUY IT!!!"
3,Showing Promise,"On a few of these songs, Staind show that they can rock with the best of 'em, and shows promise. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is rather cut-range rock, that isn't bad as it is underwhelming. But this was used as a launching pad to their mainstream-recognized album Break the Cycle.The songs that really strike you on first listen are ""Mudshovel"", with a great Alice in Chains-esque groove and some ""tormented"" (no pun intended) vocals by Aaron Lewis. Next is ""Home"", a very good semi-ballad, which could have fit right in 14 Shades of Grey, and, best for last, ""Just Go"", a whirlwind of (taking this from the reviewer) a Mudhoney-like groove. It all comes together on the crashing chorus. ""Just Go"" is, both structurally and musically, the best Staind song ever."
5,Durst Did a Great Job!!,"I bought this CD last night and as soon as i got home i listened to it non-stop.. i luved all the songs especially, there first single ""Mudshovel"", ""Home"", ""Just Go"", and ""A Flat"".... i know it took me a long time to get this album but im glad i finally did.... this album went straight to my top ten list among other great bands like Creed, KoRn (follow the leader), Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and the Deftones.... also Staind is from Massachusetts which is where i live so i gotta like em right off the bat.... i cant wait to see em in concert!"
4,"Keep an eye on Staind, because they are going to explode","Dysfunction is a hard-hitting and powerful record. The lyrics are very deep and can be quite gloomy at times, but the music as a whole is just incredible. Mike Mushok's guitar playing is what really makes this album amazing. So many breath-taking riffs and bone-crushing chords saturate Dysfunction. If you like KoRn, the Deftones, Limp Bizkit, or Tool, then you can just consider yourself a Staind fan right now."
3,Is that Layne Stanley on vocals?,Just because it says Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit on the cover dosen't mean that it will be any good. Are we sure that the lead singer of Staind is not actually Layne Stanley of Alice in Chains in disguise? If someone took the album Facelift by Alice in Chains and then grabbed Chino of the Deftones and tossed them into a blender together then the result would be this album. I listened to this album and enjoyed the first three songs but then the rest of the album sounded a lot like the first three songs. If you're looking for new bands to listen too then check out Systems of a Down.
5,dope album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Fred Durst did a hell of a job finding this band. At first i thought,""oh no, another one of these doom and gloom bands"" but then i heard the album and it rocked. Keep up the good work guys."
5,This is one of the best album I've heard in a while,"This is one of the best albums I've heard in a while, Everything on this album rips, Aaron has an amazing voice, with a soft emotional voice, then can scream with loads of power, and along with great bass guitars and drums...I think they sound exactly like T00L and Alice In Chains rolled into one, not one or the other, but both. it's a whole new sound. amazing!...I reccomend this to anyone whole likes those bands or like anything heavy and hard core, I love this!"
3,they ok,these guys were ok. i listen to them and everything but i expected more. but i do think that they will become popular cuz they got kinda an alice in chains sound. but's it'z cool.
5,No rap in this album!,I like rap metal but its getting out of control. I love this band but mabe its because they make me think of LIFE OF AGONY. I like all the songs becuase each song has a story to tell. My favorite song is A FLAT but all of them are great! If you like this band buy LIFE OF AGONY they made emotional music like this too.
3,Heavy but Melodic,"Staind is the best melodic hard roick band from '99. too many ballads but you also have great rockers like ""Mudshovel"", Crawl and Suffocate."
1,i don't get it......?,"Alright, somebody has to clue me in on why this band is popular ? Point taken, ""Mudshovel"" was an entertaining song; aside from that, this band bores me - not just the album, but them.Many of there songs seem non-descript, all the lyrics usually coming off as shallow and trite with little meaning. The songs themselves seem non-functional. What's the point of the song ? Personally, I've always felt that the greater songs have always had, well...a purpose. A great guitar solo or riff; or the song climaxes to a wonderful peak. But Staind just keeps on going and going and going...... It's gotten to the point where i just want to shove a sharp object into my ear whenever i hear this band.Please, go listen to TOOL or The Tea Party or Led Zeppelin if your looking for a band which stands as a monument in the creation of qulity music by talented musicians.I even recommend Korn over Staind (and that's saying something)...."
1,"My expectations were too high, I think.","I purchased this CD because I really like ""Mudshovel."" I read the other online reviews and thought this would be an excellent purchase. However, considering my taste in music, I found that ""Mudshovel"" was the only song on the CD worth a d***. I was not drawn into any of the other songs on the CD whatsoever-- I found them rather boring. If I could have gotten the CD single, I should have gotten that instead of the album."
1,"Awful lyrics, boring album. Worst CD i bought last decade","I hoped that this CD would be good when i ordered it. For some reason I was expecting a quality band with decent tunes but all I got was an album that's been done so many times before.The worst thing about this album (although hard to chose) has got to be the tragic lyrics. Every song is about how depressed and upset he is, well to be honest, nobody cares.The best this to happen to this band would be if they split up and don't support Korn in their forthcoming tour.Avoid at all costs."
1,"Yet another faceless, predictable no-talent nu-metal band.","Staind is just another talentless, musically stunted nu-metal loser band. Flash-in-the-pan, dime-a-dozen music for angst-ridden pimply white trailer trash 'mallrat' types who wouldn't know real metal if it hit them! Absolutely proof of the decline in rock, especially 'heavy metal', that has occured in the 90's during and after the grunge and Limp Bizkit years."
1,Absolutely dreadful excuse to waste money,"Depressing trend heavy metal album is void of all talent and amusement. The sell hit, ""Mudshovel"" (which is often confused as the name of a band itself) has a catchy chorus, but the rest of the album fails to deliver anything but negetive ambitions. The band itself fails to be anything different than the KoRn/Limp Bizkit bands that pollute our record stores. Just say ""No"" to Staind."
1,READ THIS IF YOU INTEND TO BUY THIS CD!,"This Cd took me a while to get into, then I really liked it. Two days later, it really sucked. They're exactely like KoRn's first album, only KoRn's Cd was A LOT better. If you want a good Cd that will keep you interested for a long time, type in KoRn at the search prompt."
4,A great hard rock album dark&edgey,"Well I wouldint put this nessiarily in the nu-metal genre persea.Actuly this is more hard rock than nu-metal. Altogh It doesnthave quite as much as the mellowness of break the cycle, stillit's one of those hard rockin cds that you can just listen toall the time. But don't be discuraged that it only has 9 songs.it has a secret track if you fast forward 15 minutes from song#9, another acoustic ballad by arron lewis. Now to the cd thereare some very notible songs on here. like just go,me, mudshovel,home."
4,Staind forever,"On this album are a whole collection of beautiful lyrics, which unfortunately is not necessarily to say beautiful songs. Some of the songs seem to have been cut into components, so some songs seem to have part after part after part, instead of a flowing progression from beginning to end. Even so it is enough to showcase the talents of this band.Strangely enough the best song on this whole album is a ""hidden track"" that starts long after the final song has ""finished."" It is an acoustic number that really showcases the talents of the singing that appears on this album.Buy this album to say to all your friends I told you they would be big, because they will be."
5,Staind's cd is one to buy because of its originality.,"Staind for life. This entire cd is what metal should be like. Each song has its own original parts to them which make the songs that much better. And also I would like to say that I went and saw them live the other night and they were awesome, they sounded exactly like they did on the cd. Aaron has a great voice and when he does his own style of screaming it sounds so cool. ""This sh*# is real! Watch out cuz they're not gonna stop."""
4,all of the songs are good,this album is good all the way through. some songs are more mellow than others which is fine by me. the songwriting is not complicated but is not as simple as green day. one easy way to summarize this album is to say that it sounds better turned up loud.
5,INCREDIBLE!,"MUCH BETTER THAN ""BREAK THE SELLOUT"" THIS IS STAIND IN THEIR TRUE STYLE, PURE AGGRESSION."
5,I've been Staind,"The disc includes heavy songs and some mellow songs...the mood varies from rage to melancholy and a few emotions in between. Every song has great musicianship, vocals, and lyrics. This is one of the best new bands I've heard in a long time."
4,Vivid lyrics...,"Staind's album ""dysfunction"", is definately a cd with powerful lyrics that go along with hard hitting intrumentals, and a singer who puts his all into his music. Aaron Lewis (vocals) does an amazing job portraying his feelings through the music. Songs like ""Mudshovel"" and ""home"" are just some of the amazing songs on this cd. What makes this band so great, is that when they started, they came very popular without much help from mtv, or radio play. It shows that their fans believe in what they hear, and are willing to show their admiration for this band, which is one of the hottest on the rock charts today. This is their first widely know cd, it is much better than their new one that recently came out, so if you just got into Staind, make sure that you buy this cd, it is a definate must."
5,A Stain you can't remove,"I have been listening to this album for about 2 months now. It hasn't left the player yet. The blending of melody with ripping guitars and a pair of lungs that God himself shoved into Aaron's chest make this one of the best album's of the year. And, one of the best of the decade. (1990's or 2000) If you like the hardcore then, there is plenty of it but, find some space in your head to listen to the lyrics and drama twisted around like a D.N.A. chain being bred for musical perfection."
4,Staind's heaviest,"Back in the day, I bought Staind's ""Break the Cycle"" before I listened to ""Dysfunction"". I liked ""Cycle"" so much, that I decided to listen to some of Staind's earlier works. ""Dysfunction"" is the band's heaviest and most depressing. ""Illusions of Progress"" is nowhere near as dark and haunting as ""Dysfunction"". The songs 'Mudshovel' and 'Just Go' are full of anger and pain. ""Suffocate"" and ""Crawl"" are powerful, while ""Home"" offers a different and slightly major-key approach.This, along with ""Break and Cycle"" and ""14 Shades of Gray,"" are what makes Staind special and powerful as a rock band. Their most recent ""Illusions of Progress"" may be very weaker compared to the first three albums, but I can handle the lighter tone pretty much.Grade: A"
3,"hmmmmm,,,,","What do you say about a cd that drags, and drags, and then finally picks up in its second half. The last half is Awesome and loud. I played this cd everyday, for about 2 weeks. That was a while ago, I havent played it again since."
2,zzz what? there's music playing?,"This is one of the few metal albums that can put me to sleep. Isn't Enya supposed to put you to sleep? I should buy this just to put it on at night when I have to wake up early in the morning and my roommate won't get off the phone or starts cooking or something. We could probably use this against rabid dogs or study narcolepsy with it. Clowns aren't scary, either, so stop it."
4,staind is the next big thing,"I have to say the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was it didn't have more songs on it.I love Aaron's vocals on this, he's got a very strong voice and really knows how to use it. I haven't see them live yet but i am looking foward to it.I heard about these guys when they played livestock in zephyrhills ,fl . GET IT ITS AWSOME!!!!!!!"
4,Best band since Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock,Staind presents a perfect mix of alternative and heavy metal music. I saw them on the Limptropolis tour and they were just as entertaining as Kid Rock and Linp Bizkit.If you like Limp Bizkit you'll like Staind.
4,Staind RULES!,this is definitly the best C.D. of the year.. to those who have heard it. if you are a REALLY big staind fan... you may know about a secret song on the C.D. i think that that song is the best ever.
4,Some Semi-Hardcore metal with Seattle overtones,"I really like this CD, it is pretty short, but hey, the songs make up for it. There are some nice and heavy cuts (Suffocate, Raw, Mudshovel, Crawl, Spleen) and soft ones (Home, Me.) The bonus track is kinda pathetic, but it has some cool sound effects. This CD has no real down points, very nice. If you are ever just too happy, pop this in, lyrics like ""I'm so lonely, You're so beautifal, not the only, one thats pitiful. Cute huh? Pick this up people!"
4,An AWESOME new band!,I bought this album because i trusted that fred durst would find a great band. He sure did! The best track is mudshovel. i like it so much its one of my favorite tunes of all time! You can really relate to what Aaron is singing about. This band has potential to be the next big thing.
2,"Depressing, Indeed!","I have to agree with the others. All the songs are depressing and they all sound the same! But, don't get me wrong, they are a good band, it's just that i expected more. I think if they put a little more spunk and variety, the album would have been alot better. And, if your thinkin about buying this cd, please borrow it from a friend first."
3,KORN WANNA BE BAND.....,"Well this band sounds like ANOTHER Korn wanna be band... I do admit that there are some good original songs on this cd... but all-in-all... it's another korn copy... it seems like ""hardcore rock"" music is the ""in"" thing... are you gonna jump on the bandwagon with this cd too? Wait till Korns new cd comes out... Korn is the only worthy band of ""hardcore""..."
2,Average,"It sounds ok, but it's nothing new. Sure, Fred Durst may have found them, but they lack the innovation that LB (mostly Wes' guitar playing) had on 3 Dollar Bill. Remember after grunge took over the world in '92 how there were about a million derivative bands trying to sound like Nirvana/Pearl Jam/Soundgarden/AIC? Staind is the equivalent of those bands. They are another band caught in the mix, trying to be the next Deftones/Korn/Limp Bizkit. And please, for the love of God, no more secret songs! If the song needs to be hidden, do it like Adrenaline and just make it the next track. I don't want to fast forward through 13 minutes of silence for an extra song"
2,...,"When are these middle/range metal bands going to start showing some initiative and originality again? KoRns newie, LB's newie, Coal Chambers newie, this, Godsmack, spineshank, videodrone - its all boring, uninspiring and derivative. And it seems the epidemic is spreading over into the Roadrunner league, with even Metal Heavy-weight GODS Machinehead falling afoul of this plague. Oh well...Slipknot, System of a Down and Soulfly are keeping it real for now."
4,Funny stuff,"Having seen the movie of the same name, I checked out the book. It's a funny account of Barris's life. I don't believe the CIA stuff for a minute, but it's fun to to see someone sort of create a new life story for themself because they weren't happy with the truth.Note to parents: there is a fair amount of sexual content in this book (I would've preferred more Gong Show anecdotes!) and a TON of foul language. Depending on their age, I would keep this book away from children, or at least read it first before letting them."
4,AN UNAUTHORIZED AUTOBIOGRAHPY??,"While reading this book, every few pages I would say ""You've got to be kidding me!"" Yea, it's hard to tell what's real and what's not, but one thing is for sure...this is one entertaining, quick read."
1,I DON'T GET IT,"I don't get it. One editorial says this ""reads like a classic"".Not to me.Chuck Barris likes to use foul language. I mean all the time. A simple line like ""I sat under the tree"" is transformed into ""I sat under the ***#*!* tree."" It's gratuitous, it's silly, and it's too much. It becomes seriously grating. At first it was humorous. In the end it's annoying.The whole CIA angle is preposterous. Again, at first it's kind of amusing to think of a little nebbish like Chuck Barris working as a hitman for the CIA, but that too gets old fast. I get a kick out of the ""is it true or isn't it"" debates. Folks, it's a crock. Okay? End of discussion.The parts that are interesting all revolve around the game shows. But a lot of what's written has me wondering what part of the game show stories are true. I'd like to believe all of it, but given the nature of the book, I can't tell fact from fiction.So I'm left with a book that isn't really all that entertaining.All it really did was annoy me."
4,Interesting and Funny Book,"I listened to the book on tape of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. This is a really hysterical semi-autobiography, semi-fiction(?) of the life of Chuck Barris. Barris tells stories about his life in show business creating such television hits as The Gong Show, The Newlywed Game and the Dating Game.The stories of his show-biz life are interesting and humorous.Then there is the part about his secret life as a CIA assassin, getting rid of enemies during the Cold War. This part of the book is interesting, and it sounds realistic - but who knows ? Maybe this really did happen back then. Maybe Barris made it all up to entertain the reader even more.Whichever, this is book is a great glimpse of Hollywood television history. As well as a funny look at what might have been Barris' other job. The story is so believable you can't tell if its truth or fiction.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Hollywood history."
4,the big question,Very good and interesting but of course I am a Chuck Barris fan. It is especially interesting to read the book and see the movie in the same week. The BIG QUESTION of course is: is it true or another Barris Production? And reading the book will still keep you guessing. I have a BA degree in Psychology and JD degree in law and still I cannot figure out if it is fiction or non fiction - the only disappointment I had was (after reading his first book) I wanted this book to be longer AND I wanted updated material and to know more about Penny (his wife). I hope he writes again!
4,Another excellent installment...,"This issue of Ascent is superior to some of the others. More professional and less flaky, it contains gripping trip reports and hilarious satire. The poetry is overall good, though very focused on the work of one author. The photography is beautiful but too much of it is in black and white. I found the reproduced paintings to be luridly colored and uninteresting. Overall, though, this book is well worth reading, with highlights including excellent work by Kelsey and Viola."
3,Lost my foam cover :(,"I think these are the earphones that come standard with the ZEN MicroPhoto. I think they sound pretty good for earphones; however, the foam on one of them fell off and I have to go look for it... I agree with Smith ^^ in that the foam thingies come off frequently...Other than that, its a good set of headphones."
3,"Good Quality, some flaws","These headphones sound pretty good. (They are the stock headphones for the Zen Vision:M)There are some flaws though:- a bit too big, might not fit some ears- the cloth keeps coming off (REALLY ANNOYING!!)Doesnt tangle much. Bass is good. Not Recommended, as this is a basic ""good"" quality headphone. Go with Sony or Sennheiser for a bit more."
5,"Crystal Clear, Sound is super","I bought these for myself, I'm in my late 30's and just bought the creative zen micro in pink. I saw the pink EP-480's and thought it would be a nice match to the pink micro. You can't ask for a better sounding, fitting ear phone for the price. Highly recommend"
4,great sound for low cost,I have had these for years when I used the Creative MP3 players and now use them on my ipods because the sound is fuller than any I have tried and I have tried a $!00 set of Bose.The only suggestion would be to have the remote control available and a flat cord but I know that is asking a lot for the price.If Creative does add that to these headphones I will buy them immediately.
5,A Suspenseful Read,"SUSPICIOUS MINDS by Kim Cox is a fun and suspenseful read. Ryan Donatelli is out to avenge his sister's death at the hands of a well known crime boss, while Natalie Southard is trying to keep her family's company out of that crime boss's hands. When Natalie's father is murdered, she and Ryan have to work together to achieve their goals, while trying to resist the growing attraction between them. Cox writes a thrilling story that keeps you turning the pages until ""The End."""
5,"An Excellent ""What If"" about World War II","There are a great many unanswered questions about World War II, and most of those who know the answers have died, forgotten, or refused to speak. This is a plausible account of what MIGHT have been the historical (and political) truth that powerful forces wanted to keep hidden, though we'll never be sure. But Rudolph Hess was kept isolated behind the walls of Spandau Prison until his death for a compelling reason, more than simply revenge or retribution, since his cellmates were all released decades before he died. Well written, thought provoking, full of tension, it races to a bombshell climax."
5,Heartshot,Great! I really enjoyed this one. The plot was totally believable and the man's attitude was so typically male--even to his feelings about heart surgery! I look forward to finding more books by this author.
4,A page turner,Good mystery. Not overly violent or sexual content so suitable for anyone who likes a good story. I enjoyed it a lot. Reminds me of the 87th precinct books
4,Moves along.,Quite readable but doesn't overtaxed the brain. Will probably look for other books by the same author. No more to say about it.
4,Good read,Good and easy to and a pleasure to read. Very believable plots. I surely plan on reading the entire series.
4,The strong silent smart type.,"I bought this for my husband, and he really liked it-- so I read it myself. A John Wayne type cowboy sheriff solves crimes with his Indian partner and a girl sidekick. Familiar? That's OK, it's still a good read."
2,Have read better books,"This is definitely not a book I would put in my ""keeper"" collection. When I can figure out who did it before the half way point in the book there had better be something else that draws me in. I thought the characters were very flat.I think the author was really trying to ""flesh"" them out with hints of a back story, but he definitely did not manage to do this for me. I have another one of his Posadas County Mysteries downloaded on my Kindle. Maybe it will be better as it is #10 in the series. If it is not any better I won't read more."
5,This is going on my favorites list,"Unfortunately for my book budget, this is one of the free downloads that made it to my 'must buy' list after the first book.The author could have been going down my personal list of 'likes' when he planned this series. Small western town as the setting, sensible representation of modern day county law enforcement and characters and attitudes that fit in this scenario. Main characters are an aging undersheriff and a younger, sensible and bright female deputy, both of whom go about the business of law enforcement with a minimum of angst, something I appreciate since it seems to be the exception in most current series.The plot was believable, the issues were things small town law enforcement things that are dealt with in real life now plus an interesting twist at the end.While this is not a edge-of-your-seat read, it moves well, with enough tension at the conclusion to make the ending satisfying."
5,A lovely unexpected surprise,"OK, as a preview of this review, please understand that I thought I did not like westerns, sheriffs and the desert...and I didn't until I read this book. What can I say....hopefully this will teach me to throw my preconceived ideas to the wind and try something different more often. A wonderful book....excellent character development, beautiful descriptions of the settings and Southwest....almost made me want to trade my lovely East coast for the dry desert....and an enticing mystery thrown in to balance it all. Highly recommended....I am off to #11 and probably on to #12....."
3,Ordinary,"While I don't believe The Dancing Dodo was 'hopeless' as another reviewer described it, it certainly isn't John Gardner's best effort.Dancing Dodo is set in the late 70's when many WWII vets were still young enough to be up to no good. This is a rather typical story of a Nazi plot that went wrong during the war.When an American plane is found crashed in a field in England, the Americans and Brits are called in for a joint investigation. But things start to go wrong, with people getting sick from a mysterious disease and the pricipal investigator being attached by mouldering corpses.The novel includes a romantic interlude for the hero and the classic climax at a deserted country manor house. While the answer isn't entirely obvious halfway through, the book isn't particularly suspenseful or well paced.The Dancing Dodo is a fine read, but it just doesn't go anywhere. You'll probably wish you'd picked up another John Gardner book instead."
1,Still No Subject other Than NAZIS,"Thousands of books, articles etc have been released on Nazis but still there is a passion about the subject. The Dancing Dodo entails the story of the remains of an aircraft which is discovered by some children and after this there becomes a danger of Bio Weapon. Completely hypothetical situation. Also the story is not well paced. Almost a hopeless novel !"
5,THe Original,Back to Back Classics.1999&Little Red Corvette.i wish Warners would put out nothing but Prince's 12 Versions out.that would be cool.Little Red Corvette's Long Version is Tight.still this is a Cool 2 Song Set of Two Of Prince's Biggest Songs.THe WHole Album from Which it Comes From is a Diamond to the Ear.
1,Remasters: NO!,"Others' reviews here of Rick Nelson's work have been near complete and quite informative. I personally have found the ""remaster"" quality and content of these tunes to be unacceptable in that they have ""remix' and edit qualities about them that are entirely untrue to the original production. Compare, for example, the opening seconds of ""Travelin' Man"" in the digital remaster and original versions and you'll hear what I mean. And in many tunes an artificial stereo effect is hyper-exaggerated in that the accompanyment and vocals are too separated R-to-L. Go with a good analog-to-digital conversion of the ORIGINAL producton and not what seems to be a quick re-do afterthought."
5,all the hits,"Despite the smirky smile on the cover photo, he made some big hit records and they are all here. Relive the oldies."
5,cd,Enjoy the 50's and 60's music and am happy that I added to my collection. worth adding to any collection.
2,Ricky Nelson - Greatest Hits,SOME OF THE SONGS ON THE CD DID NOT BLEND ONE RIGHT AFTER THE OTHER. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT CD BY HIM WHICH I LIKE BETTER.
4,Krusty once said it best:,"""Not just good, good enough.""And so we have yet ANOTHER Ricky Nelson collection that just falls short. First the songs should be in chronological order to chart the man's growth as an artist.Secondly, the songs I would've included are ""Tryin' to Get to You"", ""Shirley Lee"" (his most intense rave up), ""Rio Bravo"", ""I'm in Love Again"" (a better Fats cover than ""I'm Walkin'"").That being said this is still a solid set. If you ever wondered how in the world he got inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame pick this up to find out. The man could rock, sing, and he's one of the unsung founders of country rock.If you'd like to dig deeper, and can find them, get 'The Best of Ricky Nelson: Legendary Masters Series Vol. 1' (EMI/1990) and 'The Best of Rick Nelson Vol. 2' (EMI/1991). These sets cover his Imperial period comprehensively (so no ""Fools Rush In"" which came out on Decca... d'oh!)."
5,Great,"If you enjoy listening to oldies, you'll love this cd. It brings back memories and I never tire of hearing those songs."
4,Great Collection,"It is a great collection of Rick Nelson's greatest hits, with excellent sound quality and clarity. Even though this DVD is relatively short, last about one hour, it covers most, but not all, of Rick's hits plus his son's performance. The big miss is ""For You"", one of his best, and a few others. Overall, it is a great addition to your 60's collections together with such great artists like Elvis, Neil Sedaka, Paul Anka, etc."
3,Not what it's cracked up to be!!,"The CD is good, but not what it should be. I love Ricky Nelson, but some of the titles on the CD were just put on to fill up space. It's still worth getting for the classics, ""Lonesome town"" and you should know the others."
3,"Outdated, but good about World War II","I read this good book, here in Brazil.This book is short, concise and has many photos.All of them are black and white photos.About aircraft carriers until World War II, this book is very good.About aircraft carriers after World War II, this book becames weak and outdated.On end the author writes(I read a translation to portuguese language):""Its possible that aircraft carriers' dominion on sea to be short and near the end"".Well, after about 40 years later, aircraft carriers is far from an end today."
1,Non-existent tech support,This remote starter worked well for three weeks. Then the keychain remote went haywire. Attempts to contact tech support using the phone numbers provided repeatedly failed. There is no e-mail address for contact. The web site for ordering new remote is down for construction. Bottom line is the product is probably a good product; the company deserves thumbs down for their tech support (or lack thereof).
3,Works Great but installation is difficult,Don't attempt to install unless you have prior experience with electrical systems. After spending several hours trying to figure out the installation I gave up and went to Cry Toys. They had it installed in a couple of hours w/o any problems. Works very well in my F250 Superduty (w/Diesel). There is a defect in the design of the remote that makes it break easily away from the key ring. Mine lasted less than a month and I am having a difficult time locating a replacement at a reasonable price.
4,Best Value Auto Starter,"This starter system has the longest range of any I have seen. The two way communication between the remote and the data unit are unique in these devices. You get actual confirmation of any action submitted with the remote. There is no guessing if you car started or not, you know by looking at the remote status screen. You can even read the tempurature of your car interior.Pro: two way communication, several auto start modes-by specific time,by interior temp,by time interval.Remote uses AAA battery.Cons: the remote is expensive to replace."
2,buy some other remote start!,"got the bulldog 500,teck support isnt there hardley ever,abrassive teck support when he did call back about 3days later(jerry)directions very hard to decifer,they had the wrong video in the box(french language)i have a 2003 escalade ext,there in no quick t-harness for escalade,than you have to buy an xk01 buy viper to make door locks work(very difficult to understand)which didnt work,so had to buy aboot loader to make the xk01 compatable,than download .net framework 2.0,which dosnt download..so im screwed,anyone ever dealt with this & have sucess please call me anytime 815-878-1819....dont buy this product for anything but the remote starter(meaning the deluxe doesnt work with the xtras at least not 4 me)remote doesnt work as good as they say,it doesnt go through a house door!Bulldog Deluxe 500 Two-Way Remote Starter with LCD Remote"
1,Nightmare product,"We have had the worst experience with our Bulldog brand starter. Our car has been in the shop for almost 2 weeks! An adaptor was needed, it came broken, the reorder took days, it still would not work due to a broken transponder, the replacement took more days to arrive! Then to find out the printed instructions from Bulldog were wrong. We are now awaiting a needed part to replace the transponder that we found didn't need in the first place. The shop I am working with to install this nightmare product is frustrated with the lack of accuracte, contradictorary information it has received from the Bulldog people.This was supposed to be a Christmas gift. I am now stuck with no gift for my husband. I am stuck with a ""remote starter"" that is 3/4 installed and still waiting and still without a car!! If I knew how much of a problem Bulldog and their products would have been, I never would have used them."
1,this thing sucks!,"it took me about 16 hours of extensive work, which i didn't mind at all, to install it, but then when i was finally done, it didn't work at all, the owner's manunall is not detailed at all and costumer service is the worst that i have dealt with, they were not helpfull at all! so, i am returning it and investing in a better system."
2,beware,"Beware when you buy Bulldog prodcuts. The first remote starter we bought was bad out of the box. Customer support at bulldog is non exsistent. Also the company who makes the T harness has went out of business, and no longer can you find most models.Amazon.com's customer support was fantastic. They replaced the bad remote instantly and the process was pain less. The lady who helped me was great."
2,Poor Recording Process,"I love E,W & F. It's how these 3 CD's were recorded that I don't like. They each have limited frequency response. They sound clipped or cut off, as if they weren't recorded with full-range recording levels. It may be bootlegged from the distributor I bought this set from, I don't know."
4,"Would that ""World"" History Books Would Go into Some Depth on Central Europe","Let us not forget that halfway thru WWII Roosevelt and Churchill met with Stalin at Yalta and agreed to give Stalin all of eastern Poland - 1/3 of the country! - as his payment for waging the war on the eastern front. Let us not forget that, in spite of that betrayal, the Poles continued to fight on for the west, finding their way to England to join the army and air force there. Let us not forget that at war's end the west allowed the USSR to make Poland a satellite. I have travelled there on 3 occasions, and can tell you firsthand that they are still loyal to the USA. What in the Polish character, what in their past, make them so? A good beginning book for those who want to learn about America's most loyal friend.Gerald R. Schmidt, author ofThe Strange Life of Walenty Karnowski: The Rabbi's Illegitimate Grandson"
5,great grains!,love the format/design of the book. and the recipes that i've tried so far have worked out great. the masa biscuits have already assumed a regular spot in my repetoire. the barley blueberry muffins are great too. can't wait to try more of them.
2,Bread making book,I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I have another book on bread making by the same author that is very useful. This one is not. Too many of the ingredients are unknown or unavailable. I have already given the book away to someone who might use it more than I.
2,Not good enough!,"This album is VERY Lo-Fi, and Low Energy!""Hot Summer Dance"" produced by Bob Thiele, blows this CD out of the water!! DO take the time to track IT Down. You will be very pleased. I have bought three, gave 1 as a gift to the musician who reviewed my sound system."
4,Superb specialist book,"I have been keeping mantellas for a number of years and aside from a few articles in various magazines have found no decent literature on these fabulous frogs. This book gave me in-depth knowledge on how to keep and breed these frogs and I thought the photo-diary on hatching eggs and rearing the tadpoles was wonderful. The centre-fold of the book also has some stunning colour plates of these frogs. My only gripe is that it is a little pricey, however having said that it is a limited edition book and good, solid information on any subject one is interested in is almost priceless. Can't wait for the next book Mark!"
4,Except for the grace of God...,"Here is music from blessed retards and mentally ill people from around the ""World"" (most from the U.S.) There is also music from individuals that fall somewhere between retardation and mental illness, as well as a few that fall between the cracks in the cracks. _ I love this album. _ It's slightly more tasteful than a freak show, and a lot more tasteful than Maury Povich. Some songs blow in my opinion, but that's true of almost any album.... Final statement: Unless you are outstandingly boring and dull-witted, you will really like some of these tracks. Take the trip; it's worth the money!"
1,A waste of money.,"I didn't think I should spend the close to $20 bucks this CD cost, but the title & concept intrigued me. Unfortunately it's terrible for the wrong reasons. It's simply not funny. Mr. Chusid's ""outsider"" selections are such old finds (come on--the Shaggs & Tiny Tim?) that I felt Irwin was just a local DJ stealing from ""Dave's Record Shop"" --the long running segment on Letterman that is much funnier, and by the way FREE. I've had tapes of the Shaggs for ten years, and have heard them often on WABC and other stations forever. And Irwin's obscure songs are unusual, but hardly worth the effort to preserve on a CD. I can't think of a track I want to hear again, even for a laugh. Mr. Chusid had me feeling as if I was sitting in a bad music appreciation class. Glad when it was over. Avoid this CD like mosquitos, the only marginally funny track on this lazy effort."
4,Good as a gag - a little clumsy though,The head sort of flops around arbitrarily. I don't recommend them for actual use but obviously you're probably purchasing these as a semi-joke.
3,"WHY U CRYIN!! Dont like the price, dont buy it!",This isn't eastlos....and no we dont take food stamps!
1,C-Bank,"What's Up With The Outrages Price, Does This Come With A Live Perfermance?????? I'd Pay $25 - $50, But $108.00, Mann Talk about Taking Advantage Of Us Music Lovers, If I Were To Buy It Do I Get A Hug And A Kiss?

1,"""One More Shot"" is also on the Tommy Boy Perfect Beats Vol. 4","""One More Shot"" by C-Bank is also on the Tommy Boy compilation ""Perfect Beats Vol. 4."""
2,A big disappointment,"The Promise has been a song that most people know and love for a long time. It has always been one of my favorite songs, period. The album on the otherhand, is sadly awful. The lyrics are uninventive and childish. After the Promise one begins to wonder what other band stepped in and made the rest of the cd! It sounds nothing like the song we carry with us and love. It is quite clear why this was a one shot deal."
3,"5 Stars for The Promise, but compromised by the rest to 3.","The Promise is a great song. Actually, I do agree with the critic that it's the only redeeming song on this album. If you like this stuff, I recommend The Life of Reiley or other things by Lightening Seeds."
3,the girl,the record goes only 2-3 songs deep but i've been having fantasies about the girl on the cover for the last ten years.
2,Poor Quality,"Usually I am fan of Bic products, but these mechanical pencils are awful. A local bookstore was having a clearance, and I bought a pack of two for 88 cents. For that price, I can't complaint. However, the quality of the lead is terrible. Every time I write with it the lead breaks. I don't like the feel of the lead when I am writing. I do like the grip and structure of the pen, but the lead quality is bad. The eraser is bad too. When I erase, the writing smears and it doesn't erase clearly. For 88 cents I won't complain and probably keep them. I will just use them as back up pencils. But I will not pay full price or recommend purchasing them."
5,This book is a gem and a classic!,"Written in 1998, this is a book that every serious student of fundraising should read and heed its wisdom. The author, Douglas White, is world renowned in the field of planned giving."
3,Watch arrived without batteries,"When I bought this watch lately I was disappointing that it arrived without batteries. I had to find a store that could do it, not easy because this watch needs special batteries and they are expensive ($25 instead of the normal $15)."
3,Fair quality for high price,"My initial opinion is that i would expect more quality for the high price. The equator and where the two pieces of the globe meet, is covered with a red piece of tape making it look rather tacky. I think the latitude lines could meet up with each other better. If this were a $25 globe, i could understand, but it is more than twice that. The base that it is mounted on is nice looking. No user booklet to go with it like globes use to come with 20 years ago."
5,Beautiful,Looks lovely! Somewhat overpriced for the quality but it's a made in the USA product and I feel good about money staying in the US. The longitudinal lines are slightly off but it's not issue for the mostly home decorative purpose it will serve. The equator line on mine matched up perfectly and the tape didn't seem tacky to me as others have stated in their reviews. Very happy with the purchase.
1,Junk!!!,"Very cheap!! I know that a really good globe would cost hundreds, but that doesn't mean that $80 is nothing! This thing must have cost next to nothing to make. Not to mention that it does not even tilt and turn. You can't see the bottom unless you get on your knees. I bought it as a gift and I'm extremely embarrassed. I got robbed big time. Needless to say that I highly DO NOT recommend it."
5,Instant hot water,"Iam loving the convience this product has brought me. I make french press coffee with it, so I now get a better cup and fast. My wife after a month has also said she is glad I bought it, she makes coffee and brews her tee for ice tee. I found other brands for more moeny and one for less but the less did not give you three tempature choices that this one has and 208 is the perfect temp for great coffee."
4,Wild Cat Unleashed !,"From the man who wrote and recorded ""Susie Q"" in 1957 comes the first new release in 30 years and its certainly been worth the wait. Dale Hawkins was one of many rock & roll/rockabilly acts strutting their stuff in the late 50's who earned the distinction of being the most recorded of all white artists on the Chess label. Dale toured mainly with black R&B artists at that time before taking up recording duties in the 60's with the likes of Bruce Channel, Five Americans and Nilsson. More recently, he was responsible for producing the recent CD for Kenny Brown, the former RL Burnside sideman. ""Wild Cat Timer"" jumps out of the speakers from the opening title cut and continues in a similar vein taking on board a mix of swamp, blues, country and of course rockabilly. The playing throughout is loud, loose and jumping. Buy it before Dale takes time out for another 30 years to record his next gem!"
4,Same as the group Delerium,"If you're familiar with Delerium's ""Karma"" or ""Semantic Spaces"" then you will immediately recognize Intermix as a side project by Delerium. Chants, etc. are similiar in style but used differently and the songs have less of an ambient feel. Good stuff."
3,Fair effort by Leeb/Fulber,"Bill Leeb and co are of course incapable of releasing a mediocre album, but I was still a bit disappointed with this CD. Some of the tracks are good (like Ceremonial Chant), but I haven't listened to this album very much since I bought it, so there must be something wrong. Perhaps it's the lack of variety, perhaps it's the high expectations one always has when buying a Leeb/Fulber album, or perhaps it's just me. It's better than the average techno album, but then of course the average techno album is not very good."
1,Look Elsewhere,"This work is a mildly interesting collection of semi-familiar ""tales."" It is so poorly written that it reads like a first draft. Where was the editor?"
3,Fact...or fiction?,"These are fun and often interesting tales of World War 2, although where the fact ends and the fiction begins is often hard to tell. Many - indeed most - of the two-to-three page vignettes offer as a source, in addition to articles, books, and interviews, something called 'Author's Archives,' prompting the question: if the source material didn't come from anything written or spoken, where did it come from? Indeed, I consulted one of the cited works for one of the tales and found very little resemblance between the two accounts. Still, Breuer is a good story-teller, so if you're not too fussy about factual exactitude, you might enjoy this book."
2,"Great story, poor edition","Hadji Murad is a wonderful story, beautifully evocative of time and place, and rich in observation of human psychology. Unfortunately, this edition is marred by many misprints."
2,Awkward Translation,"Hadji Murad is an interesting little novel, but probably only for real Tolstoy fanatics like myself. This translation isn't terrible but it is clearly written by someone who doesn't know English rules of grammar very well. There are some very awkward passages and the worst punctuation and capitalization errors I've ever seen in a published book. I do not think Amazon should be selling this edition. It is not a professional product. There are other translations of this work available in collections of Tolstoy short stories. I recommend you buy one of those."
4,Great Story Spoiled By Typos,"The name ""Tolstoy"" and the term ""amazingly ""wonderful literature"" belong together. The book as literature can't be bested.Unfortunately, this edition is rife with typos, inconsistent translations and erroneous duplications. Words at the beginnings of sentences are not capitalized, the same noun is spelled any number of different ways and entire phrases are repeated sequentially. The first two are annoying, the third slows your reading and comprehension (hence enjoyment), and all are inexcusable in these days of grammer- and spell-checks. Strangely, there is no publisher data in this edition.Definitely buy the work of art, but not this edition of it."
3,Reading history by a great author,"This book is perhaps a short story for Tolstoy, but a novel in modern terms.The prose has a quality of poetry that translation sometimes fails.It reminds me of Thomas Moore's Lalla Rookh in that the writerwas trying to get across a culture foreign to him. He appears to be more familiarwith the traits and frailty of a Russian nobility that is more English than Russian than theIslamic Turkish tribesmen that warred with the Russian Empire just prior to the first world war.Both England and Russia where wide Empires ruled by related families.Here the Russian Prince bungles a chance to put down the rebellion cheaplyand kills the Islamic holy war prince who has sworn to help him if only he would ransom his family.Some places the story reaches high poetry levels,but like some epic poetry it tends to drag out the plot line.I think the current Russian rulers could learn from this bookand maybe our own leaders as well.Lalla Rookh An Oriental Romance"
2,hadji murad,"Hadji Murad is Tolstoy's last novel and represents his mature story telling in a way those who are only familiar with the denseness of War and Peace or Anne Karenina will find surprising. The story concerns Chechen and Russians fighting in the 19th century-which still seems to be going on-so it also gives a sense of perspective to a 21st century problem. All praises to Tolstoy aside, this particular edition is dreadful. The translation is clumsy and confusing and the copy is so filled with proof reading errors that, after a while , I became irritated by the laziness of the copy editor. Look for another edition."
5,Great to use in the classroom!,I am a second grade teacher that loves hands-on activities for my students. I even use this at home with my daughter too!
3,It's OK,"Not one of the best books its all over the place and doesn't have alot of hands on information. There are other books out there that I like more like ""The Portable film school."""
5,Good Book,"It's nice to be able to get a book like this second hand but in great shape!!It took the longest to get ot me in Hawaii, out of all my Amazon orders but arrived before Christmas, so that was fine."
2,Unsatisfied,"Much much smaller than I thought a large address book would be, not worth the price especially after shipping and pages are completely blank, not formatted as an address book."
2,breaks easily,First thing the sizing of this company is UNIQUE!!! the size that the model is wearing in the pic. is probably a Medium....because i got medium and it actully fits tight although i order small every where else...and the material is very thin..the fish net thats at the back got torn while i was tring to close the back!!! so....dont recommend it
4,Another corker from the Five boys!,"This song is Five's fourth single, the second to last release from the debut album 'Five'.It's a brilliant upbeat song, with a catchy, simple chorus. I love the part that Sean does near the end, and the live performance of this song is great!This single is good, with 3 remixes of the original song, the radio edit and a special exclusive remix of ""My Song"", which is excellent.Overall, a good value single which is good if you want to collect all the Five singles (like I did, I have all Five things)."
3,"Amazing song, but buy the album instead.","'Everybody Get Up,' off the self-titled Five, is a great song. It contains a sample from Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock And Roll."" However, the remixes on this single lack. If you like this song, I recomend buying the Five album, rather than this single. By the way, the video for 'Everybody Get Up' is amazing. I guarantee that if you like the song, you'll LOVE the album."
5,5-tastic!,"One of the GREATEST boy bands to ever come from England since The Beatles. And of course it doesn't hurt to use a former #1 song riff by Joan Jett, ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" for this tune. The BONUS track/remix for ""My Song"" is kewl too. If ya like to sing and dance, seriously, buy this CD single."
4,Best Film Score Compilation Package Available,"THE INCREDIBLE FILM MUSIC BOX is the best overall film score compilation package I have heard so far. All tracks are performed with genuine dynamic emotion by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, and are true to the original movie arrangements.There are a couple of tracks that miss the mark, probably due to copyright issues, but overall a very good, authentic representation of an excellent collection of memorable film scores. The only way to beat this one is to literally own the same collection with the original recordings on it, and that is the package that so far, doesn't exist."
2,great for a child but not an adult,seemed much smaller then I thought it would be. I can't use it but it would be great for a child.
4,Music that Crosses Borders,"I was introduced to ""Bleibt Alles Anders"" when I was living in Israel this last fall. Although I am not familiar with Groenemeyer's other albums, if they are anything like this one, they're worth a listen. Throughout this album, Groenemeyer makes good use of a variety of musical styles--punchy rock with gravelly guitar riffs, a touch of techno, folk, and classic string arrangements. My favorite track has to be ""Schmetterlinge im Eis"" (Butterfly on Ice). Groenemeyer uses a simple note pattern, which turns into a theme and variation--elegant and beautiful. Typical of his style, this song is surprising, delivering a quiet, sad love song in a way that avoids cliches and yet delivers an almost universal emotion--love unrequited. Groenemeyer uses lyrics in unusual, creative ways that have the ability to touch listeners from all over the world.His work is an excellent expression of music as an universal language--which is exactly how I believe God created it to be. :)"
1,Horrible,"I ended up watching the show. At first I liked the guys because they were trying to live their dreams but as time went on I got down right sick of their spoiled brat behavior. If that's not enough, they can't sing worth beans. Their voices on this CD is obviously studio created. If you've seen the show you'd know. Every time they sang I had to mute my television. I am not at ALL a fan of boybands but if you're going to buy one get quality like Backstreet Boys or Nsync. Please. They got these guys off the street to prove one thing. Anybody can be a star. Don't prove them right. It cheapens the entire music industry for those who have real talent."
3,Stupid... so why do I like it?,"I think this is probably the dumbest song I've ever heard in my whole entire life... yet I love listening to it. It's the beat, and the voices (which I believe ARE great. I saw them last weekend in concert). The song itself is stupid, but the boys have talent. I give ABSOLUTELY ZERO STARS to the writer! And I hate Lou Pearlman. Thanks! :)"
1,"This Is A Joke, Right?","Oh I'll admit it: I watch Making the Band and find it enjoyable. I find it interesting how these five guys, who seem to genuinely love music, are being turned into manufactured pop geeks who can barely sing or dance. Yeah I like the Backstreet Boys. I think they can sing but I do not think they are music gods. Anyway, the song Liquid Dreams is the most pathetic excuse for a song in years. Why don't you spend your money on musicians who write from the heart and aren't manufactured puppets? Instead of artists protesting against Napster, they should be protesting against music like this."
5,This CD Just Screams BUY ME!!,It is really cool!! Most of u guys will of heard of Making The Band and will love these guys and will probably of already heard Baby I Would and All For Love but Liquid Dreams has gotta be the best!! Anyways you gotta buy it it is the bomb or u could buy the album cos then u get all the good tunes! It has a really cool beat and has cool lyrics and it kinda talks about their dream girls like Destiny's Child and Madonna and Janet Jackson and Jennifer! and people like Cindy C and Halle B!! but whatever buy it!!
1,NOT AGAIN!!,"I was really interested at the beginning of the series but it got boring and then to the point where they didn't have respect for each other so I didn't want to continue with it anymore. Well, I got the CD as a Christmas gift. I listened to it and hated it. And I saw their video. I was like ""What the??"" They acted like they were ""all that"" and their voices weren't the same as when they were going through ""Making the Band."" For me, their ""liquid dreams"" are evaporating :)"
4,Very nice!,"The picture is brighter than what it really looks like, plus, it has a black spiral edge, as well as a elastic bookmark/book clasp. The pages are of ""standard"" journal type size.. they're really smooth pages.. very nice to write on. It also stays open (thanks to spirals) when you are writing. A nifty book!"
4,San Francisco. 1985. The West Light Agency & Bill Pronzini,"San Francisco is a handsome book containing 90 photographs of San Francisco in the mid-1980s. It is oddly shaped at 10.5"" wide and 8.75"" tall. The photographs are excellent. There is a good, but rather short, introduction by mystery writer Bill Pronzini; and many of the photographs are of buildings and locations mentioned in the mysteries of Pronzini and Hammett.The captions are minimal, yet informative and entertaining. The book consists of 92 unnumbered pages and is published by Skyline Press."
5,hilarious!!,This was one of the funniest indi movies that I've seen in a long time. The cast was great. Lots of unexpected names.
4,Your Word is Fire - Is A Spiritural Retreat,"The Authors have managed to create in this small volume a source book of meditation. The words of the Hasidic Masters have carefully been selected in such a way that each page is a meditation.I have had this book in my library for many years,and return to it over an over again for comfort and wisdom."
3,Don't worth the price I paid for.,"Low volume, not bass enough, or better, not bass at all. Highs are clear without distortion. No remote control. Used as charger is a mess. Looks weak. Ideal for a table tea companion; small enough to keep in your poket or a woman's bag. My wife love it."
5,An intimate portrait and tribute,"Isaiah Berlin writes here about the First President of Israel Chaim Weizmann, the person who also was the central figure in pushing the cause forward through long wasteland years. Berlin saw Weizmann in the years of his struggle in Britain for the founding of a Jewish state. He writes of this important Jewish leader with admiration and affection."
2,Buy the Series 8 & 9 Instead,This DVD is unnecessary.All material on this DVD is found on others. The Series 8 & 9 DVD has the special and the three episodes are on other Series DVD.This was released prior to the Series 8 & 9 DVD.Don't waste your money. If you are a true fan but the complete set.
3,"A wonderful show, but a disappointing video","""As Time Goes By"" is a wonderful show, but this video has very little new material. It is mostly a recap of other episodes, some of which have not been released, so some people will find parts confusing if they haven't seen the relevant episode. I was hoping for more new material, and an update on all the characters. It does, however, contain an episode (the one where Jean wants a surprise, and Lionel plans to take her to Barbados) which is particularly funny. Still, I was hoping for more. I couldn't give it less than three stars because this is still the best show from Britain ever."
2,Dissappointing,"I am an avid fan of ""As Time Goes By"" and i was dissapointed when i got the ""You Must Remember This"" VHS. I felted betrayed that it included scenes from episodes that are hard to find available to purchase. So the story wasn't really complete for me. I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that the producer's time would have been better spent by doing more seasons. Another thing i have to admit was weird, was that there was no laugh track, it was just silence after the jokes, i'm just use to having it. i would like to get the episodes i missed, to complete the story, esp the love story between Alistair and Judy. Oh well."
1,Wrong DVD,"I received a DVD titled ""Hell Girl"" instead of ""As Time Goes By - You must remember This."" Please advise."
3,captioning,"i have a hearing problem and i requested that the order be closed captioning. the order arrived complete but no closed captioning, thus nullifying an otherwise good show. very disappointing."
5,marvelous,IT'S THE BEST BRITISH COMEDY I HAVE SEEN. THE CAST IS FANTASTIC AS ARE THE STORY LINES. THE WITTICISM BETWEEN ACTORS IS GREAT. JUDI DENCH AT HER FUNNYOUS.
5,My Favorite Series,"This is a series I totally enjoy. Mostly because the people are characters I can relate to and although atractive, are personable as well."
4,Cool,"A friend told me to check this song out and i am glad I did.(The song is aiight)I like thee ""boom boom boom boom"""
5,"Excellent tune, fantastic video, GO BOYS!!!!!","I heard the music and saw those costumes for the 1st time today, I think we we all want to see more. Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom."
4,Great sounding speakers,I bought these to use for surrounds. I have definitive Technology BP10's for mains and love the bi-polar sound. Well after trying these out I have decided to use them for mains. They don't match the sound of the BP10's but come close enough.The sound is great and I am pleased. May buy 2 more for rears. You can't go wrong on these for $100
3,dont buy these unless you live near a repair center!!!!!,"HEY THESE THINGS SOUND GREAT LOOK GREAT SEEM PERFECT TILL YOU HAVE A PROBLEM AND THEY TELL YOU TO DRIVE IT TO THE NEAREST REPAIR CENTER WHICH IN MY CASE WAS A HUNDRED MILES EACH WAY FIRST MY CROSSOVER BOARD WAS DEFECTIVE THEN MY WOOFER WENT OUT SO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET THIS FIXED ""BRANDON HILL"""
4,Great set of speakers,"I just happened to come across these Wharfedales when I was looking to replace my Polk audio satellite rear speakers. Typically, a set of bipolar speakers will run well over a few hundred dollars. Under $90 shipped was an absolute steal. These speakers sound great and give a lot of depth to my surround effects. I'm not sure how they would be as mains, probably plenty good for most, but as surrounds they are great. Hey are white and mounted on my wall, blend in well, they are not small, and are very solid, and surprisingly heavy. You all not regret this purchase."
5,Surround Speakers baby,"These work excellent for surround speakers. I bought 4 of these dipole speakers. I now have a 9.2 surround sound in the living room. My wife is just ecstatic! We have Two subwoofers and 4 fronts. Well, anyways, these wharfdales sound good as surrounds and the price is right for a value system for people who still want quality music. I told my bro and he bought two as well. nice."
2,"Nice Package, But That's It","This book, although small dimensionally, contains over 300 images in 285 pages - but it is still a big disappointment. Yeah, it comes nicely packaged with a neat, sturdy little slipcase and all, but the content is pretty unoriginal. Although none of the models can pass for vintage erotica models , this could have worked rather nicely with some originality and variation. I guess they tried to make up with quantity what the book lacked in quality. Please see the images I have posted and read my comments - I'll let you judge for yourself."
2,not worth it,the patterns of the furniture these women are sitting/lounging on are the most interesting part of this book.
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzz im sleepy,"hotwire was a whim pickup after hearing the demo of ""not today"" which rocked bigtime.the new version sounds awful, very over produced and sleek just like the rest of the cd.the guitars have no substance and russ vocals dont cut like they did on the demos.""nice profile"" is a fun little track very catchy and poppy while ""rugburn"" has a depressing riff and mellow verse and ""tweaked"" is pretty heavy straightforward but the song has been tweaked too much from its original.overall the album is quite boring, i tried to get into it on several occasions, just never happens.try their demos, thats where the good hotwire is at."
1,worst major label rock album of 2003,"This album is tied with Depswa's Two Angels & A Dream for worst major label rock album of 2003. The music on this album is unforgivably generic and formulaic, but it's nice to see a band that isn't content to be just a forgettably mundane example of mainstream rock. They take talentlessness to a whole new level with riffs that must have been intentionally designed to be the least catchy and creative they could possibly come up with. In a genre overflowing with mediocrity, Hotwire stand out as a shining light of complete musical ineptitude."
2,"not next level, nothing special here","They tout that this is the next level energy drink. It is basically caffeine and sugar. That is it! Where is the next level? In the hip world of energy drinks, you have to stand out with those sorts of phrases, but this drink offers very little to stand behind the words. It does taste good, but other than that, it is lame. Low caffeine, small 8oz can, very few vitamins and/or herbs."
5,Great Hydrogen Info!,"""This book is very inspiring! Written by a man ahead of his time who converted the first car to hydrogen in the 60's!.He tells about his experience converting several vehicles and even an entire homestead to hydrogen.It is filled with practical technical information from over twenty-five years of hydrogen research. It covers automotive conversions, hydrogen gas appliances, metal hydride storage, electrolysis, hydrogen fuel cells, and more.Absolutely a must read for anyone interested in hydrogen as a fuel."
2,Disapointing.,I am a Hydrogen enthusiast. I was looking for a lot more then this book offered. Finished it in a day. A few good ideas but not up to date.
3,Not So Great,"Compared to the first ""Mr. Vampire,"" ""Spooky Encounters"" and other Hong Kong comedy-horror films of the mid-'80s, this one is second-rate. It isn't that funny, and the only attempt to create any real monsters is a couple of 'vampires' that don't hop (one reviewer says they hop in the other films as the ground hurts their feet, but attributing the hopping to rigor mortis is a much more logical reason) despite having the appearance of the typical vampire/corpse of these films.The secondary plot of the dead concubine of a clunky general coming back to life only to imitate every move of the guy who robbed her grave really isn't funny. I'm sure it was difficult to film as well as it was, but it just doesn't provide laughs. Not to mention that part of the plot is left hanging at the end without any resolution.Maybe worth seeing once, but not worth owning."
5,a Great Collection by the Elements,"good news coming with the Elements releasing there Live Album from 1975&this set Highlights there Classic Material.the cool thing about Earth,Wind&Fire is the way there Music,Production&Instrumentation all Blended as One.that is the Power of there Sound.this is Prime Time EWF."
1,Limited Knowledge From a Limited Mind,"This book is sort of like buying software -- It lures you with promises (features) which turn out to be ""vapor ware,"" coming soon to a store near you. Don't expect the promised references to necessary data to appear anytime soon on their website, as I have been trying unsuccessfully to get these clowns to provide what they promised, for quite some time now. This book is nothing but a sales tool for their own overpriced components, which can be found on [another site] ... Don't be ripped off... save yourself the trouble and do some real research before succumbing to the [lack of] information in this book."
1,Buyer beware!,"This is an overpriced book with a lot of mistakes and no real information. I agree with the other reviewer that this book seems to be a sales gimmick. The only information provided in this book is of the most banal and obvious. The circuit diagrams are mostly trivial constructions that could easily have been copied from a ""circuits for dummies"" book. Buyer beware!"
1,A Great Album if You're a Leon Russell fan...,"I too thought I was buying a Pato Banton album, only to end up with Leon Russell's ""Tightwire."" Says Pato Banton all over it, too. I'd steer clear of this one, folks. Order ""Life Is A Miracle"" instead--a definite 5-star."
1,Not stackable,"I was going to give this product a ""3"" because the trays acutally quite nice. Just as the previous reviewer, I love handing out chips in them.However, I re-read the name of the product, and I had to change my vote to a ""1"". These chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating, not only during game play but afterward when I'm trying to store them!"
1,incompatible,"I had this software when I was running windows 95 and it was one of the best pieces of software I had. There were original articles from the very start of Time magazine, with lots of pictures and video.I saw it and decided to purchase it since my copy had deteriorated so I purchased this one However most of the functions cannot work on windows XP. It is almost a waste of money though some of the type articles can still be accessed."
3,Another relaxing soothing release from Pema,This is only my second CD from Pema Chodron. I enjoy listening to her while in the car to and from work. Very helpful hints on relaxing during meditation. Thoughtful and inspirational.
5,Getting Unstuck,"Pema Chodron is an American Buddhist nun and she is prolific in her writings and audio teachings. She is also user friendly in her presentations where anyone can learn from her. This program is one of my favorite. She talks about what to do when we get hooked. The Tibetan word for a hook is ""Shenpa"". There are three CD's and the information is very helpful. We all get hooked in our lives with things that happen to us or with things that people say and then we either fly off the handle or have panic attacks or just plain become stressed out.I give this as a gift to friends. This one was also given as a gift and it is highly recommended by me as is all her other work."
5,So Wise and Practical,"This CD set is a boon for those of us who need a helping hand on the spiritual path. Pema has walked the walk so well and provides so many great insights. Her discussion of ""shenpa"" is a great tool for dealing with emotional baggage."
5,a great gift,"i gave this as a gift to a friend, and he hasn't stopped thanking me for it. he tells me every day what a great gift it was and how much it has helped him deal with everyday life."
4,Just what I needed!,I was looking for answers when I purchased the cd book. Going through menopauase can be a monster. I was specifically looking for creative ways to deal with stress and anxiety- things that apparently go hand-in-hand with menopause;-) Well the book helped me to relax once I realize that I'm having one of those moments. And through I ordered the book with standard shipping it was delivered in just a few days which was great for me.
1,Defective Recording,"This is an advisory not a review of contents. There is a distinct clicking-popping sound on the CDs that I received. For me it is disconcerting and makes it difficult to listen to these recordings. I had the very same problems with Pema's recordings ""Don't Bite The Hook."" I've tried the CDs in various players and hear the same strange sounds. It is noticeable when Pema speaks.I assume something is wrong with her microphone attachment but not being an expert can't say for sure. I'm puzzled why these same odd sounds are produced on recordings from two different companies. I wonder why Sounds True and Shambhala Audio release these defective CDs.If you don't mind ""snap, crackle and pop"" sounds on your audios I suppose you might give these a try."
3,Improve your meditation,"The focus of her talks are on problems that occur during meditation and how to best reframe them to get unstuck, especially if you still lose presence during anger. There is an acceptance and gentleness in her solutions. The contents is very much like that found on [...].The talks are interesting but lack the clarity, structure, density, and innovative thought found in abridged [...]."
1,UGH,"Total waste of money. Spends a lot of time discussing the 'problems,' but the solutions are so vague & general as to be completely useless."
5,Eye-opening exploration of how we can get out of our own way,"This work provided me with the most practical emotional 'tools' I've ever been exposed to. Pema is not only fun and 'centering' as a speaker, but she speaks articulately and without a lot of extra verbage. She gets right to the point and in the gentlest way shows us possibilities of responding differently to things that disturb us. We learn that by looking at things differently it is easy to empower ourselves to not be so disturbed, to not be so reactive, and yet still be very much authentic to ourselves. She is a true beacon for those trying to become more patient, more positive, more focused on what they really want to become in their lives. Highly recommended for people of any age, temperament or religious persuasion."
5,Felt so intimate and personal,"The first CD typical Pema, which is all good. The second CD an interview, which, at first, turned me off because I was off put somehow by hearing another woman's voice. I find Pema so soothing and the new voice was distracting. However, in listening for the third or fourth time I realized, wow, this is seriously about how Pema does 'it', not just a lecture to a large audience. Thus, the feeling of intimacy and learning how the practice of Buddhism works for her. Now, I feel I can relate to a more real person, not just an accomplished Buddhist nun. More personal, easier to assimilate and learn. Perhaps this will be the CD I turn to when I need strength and courage and kindness to self."
2,Rap metal - for better or worse,"These guys are not bad.. but there are also no surprises. Overall, this CD is a competant helping of rap metal better than many popular rap metal bands. But, it is a formula which grew tiresome and predictable pretty quickly and Innercorse does nothing to push boundaries. It is nothing new, but fans of the genre might find it worthwhile."
3,the guitar work is somewhat similar to deftones,"these guys are pretty cool. critics are probably gonna just write em off as another ""rap-metal"" band but that really isn't gonna be doing em justice. they have a cool sound with their vocalist switching between rap and melodies and he does it pretty convincingly unlike some vocalist out there. they have a cool musical sound too. somewhat simliar to the deftones and when they slow the riffs down even more their sound kind of reminded me of old school silverchair. and they have a good bit of electronic elements that their dj throws into the songs for em which is cool cuz he doesn't just scratch like most band dj's do. overall they have a pretty cool sounding, well produced album. check em out."
4,Some books are classics just because they've been around a long time,"And some are classics because they're JUST THAT GOOD.Many Moons is in the second one. Fully twenty years after I read it as a child, I picked it up and was able to remember the plot. That's lasting power.This is a funny book about the difference in perceptions - who is right about the moon? - and in wisdom. It has a simple funny story on the top, but it invites a few different deeper discussions with young children. Love it :)I will note that it's a little wordy for a picture book. You may want to save this for reading aloud to an older child, or even waiting for them to read it to themselves!"
5,"This book brought us smiles, wider than a mile","Read this enchanting book to children at bedtime. Be sure that the storytime doesn't conclude with the shutting of the book, but instead, with peering through the curtains to the night sky. My two girls loved the tale of the princess who wanted the moon for her very own -- and they giggled in delight at all of the sophisticates and intellectuals who threw up their hands because they could not conceive of a way to bring the moon to the girl. The court jester, who knows how to think like his audience, and hence, think like the princess, figured out an easy way to make the child happy. Would that we all stopped thinking so hard about why things are possible -- and instead -- saw the possibilities that come from seeing life through the prism of the child's imagination."
1,"I never received this package, Amazon!","I never received this package, Amazon! And I don't appreciate your not providing a more appropriate venue for telling you that!! - Mary Davis"
2,Good,"This book was good, however in my opinion I did not care for it as much as some of the other books I have read that were Caldecott winners. This book's story line consisted of a little girl who became ill and asked her father the king to get her the moon so she could become well again. After calling on many trusted wise officials to help, it was the court Jester that finally solved the problem of procuring the moon. Then, the king did not want his daughter to know that the moon was still in the sky. So, after talking again with his wise aids it was the Jester that finally asked the princess of why the moon was in the sky. She gave him the answer and then went to sleep. The pictures in this book left a lot to be desired in clarity of detail."
4,Buy this book and forget Internet.,"Before I became aware of Rough Guides, I used a lot of time (and money) searching for information about travelling in USA on the internet. After this discovery was almost no need for that. The quality of the information is high. The authors have a very critical attitude to what they the write about.Enjoy this book."
1,Buy another guidebook instead!,"I've been using different Lonely Planet guidebooks and I wanted to try another guidebook, so I bought The rough guide to the USA, but I'm very disappointed over The rough guide to the USA.Compared to Lonely Planet The rough guide is:-less informative-not so funny to read-of poorer quality (the back went broken in a week)And worse: The maps are really bad, if they exist at all. And they do not point out sights, hotels, restaurants etc with numbers like they do in Lonely Planet guidebooks. Also it lacks on historical background which is very annoying for a person who have never been to the states. The section on dangers and annoyances is far from comprehensive. Distances are in miles...I can continue with more annoyances but I think you'll get the point.The only positive I can say about The rough guide to the USA is the price, it's cheap!"
5,The only guide you need,"The Rough Guide is the best guide available. They give you an insight into what you want to do and regularly point out things you would have otherwise missed. My wife & I have just completed our 3 cross country trip with this book and they are yet to fail us. The best thing, outside of the history and background information they provide you is the restaurant recommendations. None of this where to get the best tofu burger here. They send you to where the locals eat and it has never failed us for great authentic eating. We threw out our other guide books months ago and swear by this series."
2,Love those out-of-date listings!,"What an ingenious plan ole Mark Ellingham and the gang at Rough Guides have - publish the same travel guide for 2-3 years and hope no one looks at the date. Simply remarkable. If you'd like to continuously run out of money, by all means, buy this one. However, if you'd like an up-to-date book (even if one written by smarmy Harvard types), Let's Go is the one for you!"
2,"Great Guidebook, awful images","I have very mixed feelings about the Kindle version. It is great to have everything in one place (as the book has 1000 pages) and things are easy to locate and read on the iPad. The Rough Guide itself is as good and dependable as always, with interesting history and background information as well as specific local knowledge mixed in.Everything, however, falls down with the image quality. The images are very small sizes and thus blurry at any size above a postage stamp. The maps are basically unusable, as the image quality is so bad that you cannot zoom in enough to actually read the street names and references from the text. Which basically means we will have to either download specific maps wherever we go, or buy local paper maps and carry them around too, which we were trying to avoid in the first place when we bought the kindle edition...Am thinking of returning it, unfortunately, guide books aren't much use without the maps!"
2,WHAT A MISTAKE-BUT DON'T GIVE UP READERS,"I'm so glad this was not my first introduction to Linda Howard! I don't care that this book was written back in the early 80's, its attitude between this particular man and woman came out like something back in the 40's & 50's. Reading about Jessica's acceptance of insults, belittling, and domination by the man she ""loved"" and still have ""stars"" in her eyes was way to much for me. Maybe it was just the degree of it all. I'm glad Linda Howard has left this level of writing behind her and has written the battle of the sexes with more fun in mind. Don't let this book stop you from reading her newer books, she really has gotten better."
1,Ugh!!! Not her best work,"I am Linda Howard's biggest fan, but even I have to say that this book was awful. The back cover made it sound promising, but the characters never developed the way I was hoping they would. The 'hero' was such a jerk! I kept waiting for Ms. Howard to shift the story to his point of view or explain his actions, but it never happened. The heroine was a total pushover. Along with 'An Independent Wife,' this is her worst book. Read anything else by her and I promise you'll be impressed."
3,"Forewarned is forearmed, so I didn't expect much.","I've read all the bad reviews about this book so I only rented a copy. Niko is the typical '80s dominatingly possessive Greek hero, while Jessica is the mistreated innocent who (Egads!) cries like a watering pot. The sexual tension was a lot better done than the actual sex scenes--which were little more than a paragraph going something like: ""They came together in rapture...floated in a sea of contentment..."" The writing style sure doesn't sound like LH, but is more like Sara Craven or Anne Hampson--both of whom I liked back in the '80s."
1,This is a romance don't,"As an avid Linda Howard fan my eyes are always open for new releases and reissues. I cannot express just how disappointed I was with this story. How can this be called romance? I would never want this kind of love. Nikolas Constantinos is the single most abusive (both verbally and physically) male character I have ever encountered in a Romance novel. Jessica Stanton was weak and I would never consider her a role model. Nikolas' behavior was inexcusable yet Jessica repeatedly forgave him for his rages. Do not judge Linda Howard by this book! I would have never read her books again if this were my first! Try ""Diamond Bay"" or ""Dream Man"" to discover a real man."
2,This book is not up to Linda Howard's usual standards.,"""All That Glitters"" is a reprint, first issued in 1982. The heroine, Jessica Stanton, a.k.a. The Black Widow (a 23-year-old crybaby) keeps the hero, Nikolas Constantinos (an overbearing billionaire bully) in line by bursting into tears every time they have an encounter. The love scenes are flat and uninteresting. All I can say is that I'm glad I read the ""Mackenzies"" first or I would have missed a lot of good reading if I had read this book first."
1,Possibly one of the worst romance novels ever written!,"I like Howard alot. It is incomprehensible to me that this book was reissued. But we do have Elizabeth Lowell with a reissue of Remember Summer to make us wince as well. The male character abuses the female both mentally and physically to the point that pain is a central issue both for the reader and the protagonist, if Amazon allowed zero or minus star rate values it would apply here. please excuse my typos"
1,Should not have been reissued!,"Like many other reviewers, I am a big LH fan. This definitely is not one of her best, IMO. However, it is a reissue and her writing is much better now. I usually keep and re-read all of her books, but I have only read some of the earlier ones that have been reissued once. Believe me, ATG was not her only early work that I did not enjoy. An Independent Wife, Against the Rules, Heartbreaker were others that I did not like.I just wanted to say that many of the reviews posted here had me laughing soooo hard. I know that they were meant to be serious and I agreed with most of them, but the humor was fantastic."
1,The Only LH Book I've Ever Hated,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. I would give it 0 stars if I could.There are already many overwhelming negative reviews but I have to add another one just so you know HOW BAD IT IS. Jessica is lovely but damaged and Nikolas is a narcissistic and crass bully. You would think in normal Linda Howard fashion they would grow for the better and learn to love, but Nickolas is horrendous and domineering--he all but forces Jessica to sleep with him at one point. He's not just unlikable, he's actually a bad person and her acceptance of a clearly abusive relationship is disgusting. I like the hero/heroine interaction in EVERY other Howard book but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth.***DO NOT JUDGE HER BY THIS BOOK. If this is the only one you've ever read, GO READ ANYTHING ELSE BY HER and you will love it!***Sorry Linda, but 1 stinker out of 300 isn't so bad..."
1,Terribly disappointing,"There is tragically little plot in 'ATG' and very superficial character development. The primary storyline consists of the relationship between the two main characters who are, unfortunately, as unsympathetic as humanly possible. The female lead is wet beyond belief while the male lead is simply obnoxious - you cannot help but think that they will make each other miserable and deservedly so. Altogether a waste of time and energy.I have read and enjoyed Linda Howard's work before and was extremely disappointed with this book. It is hard to imagine that the same author produced the excellent 'Dream Man' and 'Kill and Tell'.If earlier works have to be republished why not reprint the 'Mackenzie' series?"
1,Offensive!,"Like most of the other reviewers on this book, I am an avid Linda Howard reader. While I don't love every story she has written, I was horrified by this book. I have never read a story where the ""hero"" is incredibly abusive physically, mentally and emotionally. It is truly unbelievable that anyone would publish this story, even in the 1980's. How can you love someone who has terrorized you, physically assaulted you numerous times, and ignores anything you say? It makes me shudder to think that some young girl might read this and think that this is the way relationships are supposed to work."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this one.,"I am a fan of Linda Howard but this book was so unbelievable that I can't believe she penned it. The characters are beyond outrageous, especially Niko. Any woman would walk away or shoot the man. Jessica is indeed a doormat. I should have read the reviews before I bought this one. I spent the entire time reading it feeling angry and frustrated but finished it anyway because I always try to get through a book even tho' it is not good. This was NOT good."
2,Not up to Howard's standards.,"I am a big fan of Linda Howard but was very disappointed in this book. What a whimpy woman, I thought if she cries one more time I would scream!I think this book needed a little updating before it was reprinted. Please don't let this book keep you from trying Linda Howard's other books- they are great!"
1,ALL THAT GLITTERS,"I love Linda Howard and read anything that she writes. But this book was the worst. The hero treated the heroine awful! I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't. If you were turned off by this book, please try another Linda Howard book (Duncan's Bride is a wonderful start, and Open Season and Mr. Perfect are truly some of her best books)."
1,Only Howard book I've NEVER finished - Soooo BAD!,"Not my usually lovable Linda Howard - an early bodice-ripping stinker! I've read everything Howard has written and went on Amazon to find anything else Linda Howard that I could get my hand out (i.e. early works, out of print stuff). I got a used copy and hated it so much that half-way through the book I literally threw it at the wall in disgust. The ""hero"" is chauvenistic jerk and the ""heroine"" is far too weak for my modern sensibilities. Rape is not sexy, and this book is a waste of money."
2,I'm deaf from all the chest-thumping!,"As a confirmed Linda Howard fan, I looked forward to a story I'd not yet read - but oh boy, this one was not one of her better efforts! Linda's heroes are renowned for their ""alpha"" male characteristics, but Niko Constantinos takes it two steps past alpha, and does Greek men a disservice at the same time. Jessica Stanton is a whiny, tearful idiot, who lacks the courage of her convictions. She's also never read the instruction manual for heroines - you don't mention marriage the first time you're in bed with the hero! Tsk tsk. It's an interesting read for Howard fans, but if you're looking to try one of her books, don't start with this one unless you're still convinced that men are dominant and should control the lives of their women. If you do feel this way, then by all means take this book back into your cave, but make sure you skin the woolly mammoth carcass before you settle down to read!"
1,Don't be fooled by the printed date,"This book is deceiving because it is listed as being printed in 1998, however it was written in 1982 and it shows. Linda had not yet developped the writting style we know and love from her more recent works. The most emotion this book generated on my part was a desire to shake the so called heroine until she wised up and got a spine! She was just pitiful. The weird thing is that in the 80's most romance books were like this and this one must have been a success because LH is a talented author. However, times have changed, thank God, and the type of man that treats the woman he loves like he always knows what's best for her and carts her around like a piece of luggage is a thing of the past and should stay in the past!"
1,WOW! What a Stinker!,"I wish I could give this no stars. I have read most all of Linda Howard's other books and liked most all of them very much. This, however, is the worst book I have ever read, written by anyone! I can't even finish it, because it just doesn't get any better. The heroine is spineless, lacking all self-respect, and unlikable. THe hero is hateful, ego-maniacal, cruel, and like the another reviewer said, would make a good villain. I kept reading until Jessica left Nikolas after he insulted her, verbally abused her really, told her she wasn't good enough to marry him! Then she went back to him and I couldn't stomache any more. This is not a romance. Actually, I wondered if some chauvenistic male wrote it and Linda Howard just put her name on it. Don't read this, any other Linda Howard book will be worth your time."
1,Not a romance.,"I have never read a romance before where the ""hero"" was such a jerk, actually jerk does not really cover it, but what does isn't printable. I would recommend everyone skip this book. Okay it was written in '82, but even comparing it to books of this era it is still a dud. Heros are supposed to be just that - heros, someone to look up to. This guy would be more suitable in the role of a villian"
2,I'M SADLY DISAPPOINTED,"This was an okay book. I'll say that much because Linda Howard is my favorite author, and everyone is allowed mistakes. Maybe I should go back and read it over like the reviews say, but for now I have to say this is my least favorite Howard book, and believe me I have plenty of her books and will keep buying them until I die."
3,Lacks glitter,"Even though I adore Linda Howard, ""All That Glitters"" was definitely not one of her best works. There was something lacking in the story... a sense of loving, a real relationship of equal parts between Jessica and Nikolas. The story itself was pretty good, but the essence of the characters was lacking the usual luster Linda Howard puts into her works."
4,Not of the best,"I am going to have to agree with some of the other customer reviews. However, I notice that some of her later books do not follow the same style, so I guess it was just the time that she was writing this book. The heroine stayed in a seemingly abusive relationship, while the hero seems like an abusive jerk who manipulated her to get his way."
1,dont waste your money,I received one and it did not have the memory card with it. Do not buy this item if you expecting it to have the memory card with it.
1,Not what I ordered.,"I ordered the (13)PSP Mega Memory Pack,only after opening it and not seeing the memory card I realised the box said (12)PSP Mega Memory pack. I know I should have checked the merchandise before I opened it, but I usually get better service from Amazon. Please do not make this sort of mistake again. I was somewhat dissappointed this time. However this does not negate all the excellent service I have received in the past and I look foward to continued good dealings for the furture.Respectfully,Herold."
1,Buy else where not here,I used to work for Amazon.com I worked in their warehouse. They get stuff stolen all the time. If you buy this from here and it does not have a memory card. There is your answer. I would not buy this item from here just because there is a good chance it wont be in it. other than that great site
2,MAKE SURE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"I have received several orders of the 2x180 Duralactin tablets. They are shipped quickly by the reseller and packaged well enough, but each of the last few bottles has had several broken or crushed tablets. The previous shipment had more than six smashed pills, and the bottle I checked at random in my most recent order had only 177 pills out of 180. That may sound like I got 98 percent of my order, but to me it sounds like I got my Big Mac with a bite taken out of it. It's a day's worth of pills for my dog. The vendor needs to consider if he should send out a free bottle of 60 tablets for every ten of the 180's a customer orders ! And Duralactin needs to figure how to deliver 180 pills, when that's what they say they're selling !!"
1,HORRIBLE,"In my own personal opinion, Chris Jones and W.O.P is not what the gospel music industry needs. His album production is horrible and the sound of the choir is horrible also, I would not put out an album that has my choir sounding like a store-front choir trying to get over, and thats exactly what this album has done. Chris, you have tried to succeed in this industry but you haven't , Detroit has many legends in the industry to name a few Dr. Toni Booker and the Booker Productions, LaQuint Weaver and the Halleujah Singers, Bridgette Stanfield and P.O.P, Linda Ross and V.O.P, I think you should of consulted with some of your elders that has EXPIRENCE in this field before u came out with this album... Try next time!!!!!"
3,FUNNY FRENCH COMEDY OF THE EARLY SEVENTIES,"1972. Written and directed by Claude Berri. The continuation of the saga of Claude, Claude Berri's cinematographical double. In just 90 minutes, Claude Berri describes how France tried to assimilate the American sexual revolution of the late sixties. Funny and enlightening."
2,Not as great as i imagined...,"the only reason i gave it two starts is because a flexi light should be able to hold all positions but because the light is top heavy it unbends in certain positions but it was cheap so i guess no harm done. just an fyi its common sense if you make things top heavy, they will topple."
2,ok but not very bright,"This works well enough if you want to illuminate your keyboard in complete darkness. But I needed it to shed more light on the paperwork in front of my keyboard and it really didn't add enough light for that. I would get a very bright spot smaller than a dime, and very little spread out from that. So for those that need to look at their keys to type, it may help them, but otherwise I don't see how it has enough brightness to do much good. It works as advertised though."
3,"Quality Management: Introduction to Total Quality Management for Production, Processing, and Services (4th Edition)","It's a good book, have the topics that I need to my class, but the author talk a lot of history in the chaptersPD. I don't like the history too much."
3,its ok,"it was small very small, when ordering this i expected it to be at least twice the size it was. but anyway it was good quality"
1,Reviewing the Reviewers??,"I thought this was a forum to review BOOKS, not the REVIEWERS?? Apparently this site for THREE MOONS RISING is deserving of reviewer harassment every time a negative review is posted of this book. Wake up people -- stop negating the reviewers -- everyone is entitled to their own opinion, whether they like this book, or not."
1,I couldn't stop laughing!,"The only good thing about this book is the title! I've never read anything written so strangely before. The beginning is just bizarre in its whole tone, and it pretty much continues on that way during the rest of the book. Actually, I thought it was quite comical - except for the so-called ""love"" scenes. Romantic? NOT. If you're looking for a good laugh, be sure to read it. But get it at the library if you can. I wouldn't buy it!"
2,Hard to keep attention on story,"I have read hundreds, perhaps thousands of romance novels. I have never had such a hard time reading a novel due to typographical errors and simply bad grammar. Where was the editorial control for this novel? The story was acceptable, but the dialogue was stilted. There was no examination of the characters' motivations or evolution towards intimacy. This novel needed a lot more editorial work before it was placed before the reading public."
1,Back to the drawing board --,"THREE MOONS RISING revolves around mysterious interlocking necklaces, blue water cats, barely believable fictional planets, and one man's determination to make ""his"" woman bend to his ways at any cost. If this is romance, give me a good murder mystery any day!When scenes involve both the hero and heroine together, their points of view shift back and forth so often, I felt like I was watching a tennis match. The hero also has no concept of romance, constantly trying to force himself upon the heroine, who can't understand why she has such a magnetic attraction to him. I couldn't understand it either.The book needs much more editing than it obviously was given. With more in-depth and believable, sympathetic characterization, this might have been at least a readable story. Smoother transitions between chapters and scene breaks are also needed. As it stands now, it didn't work for me on any level."
1,Couldn't finish it,"Three Moons Rising is a mish-mash/mumble-jumble soap opera space ride on a collision course with disaster.Before anyone hops, skips, and jumps all over me for not liking this book - yes, I know how to read. No, I don't pay too much attention to commas, or lack thereof. I DO pay attention to character development and prefer them to be 3-dimensional, not 1-dimensional, and BELIEVABLE, even if they're fantasized. The so-called hero plain old gave me the creeps.I give the author a B for effort, a D for characterization, and an F for execution. I had to force myself to get even halfway through this book, then just couldn't finish.In my humble opinion, Ms. Eskew needs some major help in the polishing and editing departments before spending good money after bad on self-publishing.A bit of advice: DON'T let friends and/or family (as someone else implied) edit your work - they'll tell you what you want to hear because they love you. They can't be impartial. Use professionals."
4,I enjoy this for spanish language practice,"A mi me encanta esta revista para practicar el espanol que aprendi en la escuela.What I like about this magazine is that it's light, mindless reading that helps me keep up on my Spanish, especially slang. I try to get into books but I'm not hispanic and often can't relate to the stories. People en Espanol is a bit over the top in the check-out-your-brain department. Vanidades at least has some decent articles that I sometimes read to my son, like stories about Thomas Edison or other historical figures. I've tought my son to speak and read spanish as well and reading is an awesome tool to help me keep up on vocabulary. Bummer about the person that got spammed by this mag. I wish they'd spam me so I could get it for free!"
4,A diclaimer about the sound quality...,"Since I am one of the sellers it is only fair to mention the sound quality on this disc. To make a long story short, the album was recorded by the Phantom Rockers in Texas and pressed by their label in Belgium. Somewhere along the line it was sent to a mastering engineer with questionable sound skills/hearing who altered the high frequency to make it slightly garbled, resembling a lower-quality mp3. Unfortunately this mix made it to pressing and all original recordings of the album no longer exist, so this version is all that remains. However since most listeners do not have the critical ear of a serious audiophile and will probably be converting the album to mp3 for their Ipod anyway, it will not be that noticeable to most. Regardless, it is still a collectible album from the Rockers and their only full-length featuring the shredding guitar of ex-Exploited member Karl Morris."
4,Pretty Darn Good Metal....,"When I first saw the 11th Hour video, I loved it and decided to get this cd. I must say that even though Ilistened to this for quite a while, I eventually did get tired of it but now I enjoy listening to it every now and then. As others have said it does get repetitive but its not so bad that it deserves a really low rating. I skip a few songs no matter what, but most are just good head banging metal. I am looking foward though to seeing them live this summer with some other great bands. Anyway pick it up for some good times but don't expect anything incredibly original or groundbreaking."
4,New American Gospel was much better,"This is a pretty good album, but Lamb of God changed their style in key parts with it. Barely sounding like their previously release, New American Gospel, this is still good but I wish they kept with their old style. Recommended."
4,metal cd of 2003,i was reading a magazine the other day and saw that lamb of god was their pick for the best cd of 2003. so i decided to pick it up and it is a very good cd every song is hard hitting and to the point just heavy as they can get. this is a cd for metal fans.
5,Buy this CD,"Where do I start? Just a fantastic...brutal....heavy sound. Nothing else out there like it. Probably the best metal CD I've bought in years. I just ordered their first album, ""New American Gospel"", and I can't wait to hear it.If you like metal, just buy it. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Best LOG Album To Date,"Simply amazing. Randy has got his signature growl on this album, which is kick ass. As the Palaces Burn is tied with Devildriver and Vital Remains for Album of the Year (for me). This album went in a heavier direction than New American Gospel, making it better. As I have said before, see these guys live. I saw them at Ozzfest this summer and they were brutal as f***. Best songs are Ruin, Purified, 11th Hour, For Your Malice and A Devil in God's Country. If you don't already own this.... what the hell is wrong with you?! These guys, along with Slipknot, Devildriver and Meshuggah, are the future of metal. Buy this album!!"
4,A damn good metal album.,"Lamb of God's As the Palaces Burn is an excellent example of a relatively young metal band getting out there and doing some damage. Heavy riffs, pummeling drums, and growling vocals abound on this very good record. The music is extremely heavy but does not venture into the realm of just chaotic noise, and the vocals can be rough but are unique and not as harsh as many of the metal vocalists out there (if you don't like cookie monster type metal vocalists as I don't, you still may like this; check out the samples). The only problem I have with the album is that it can seem repetitive. Many of the songs sound the same, and as mentioned by previous reviewers, the tempo rarely changes. That being said, this is still an excellent album that metal fans will surely enjoy. Check it out. I look forward to the new Lamb of God album."
5,"Great album, see them live!","Lamb Of God aren't just a great band to listen to, they put on a stellar live show. Here's how I got into them.1. I was watching my favorite show, none other than the Headbanger's Ball, and the video for ""11th Hour"" came on. I saw it, and I was hooked.2. I purchased the Freddy vs. Jason soundtrack, only to find out that ""11th Hour"" was on the album.3. I purchased the Headbanger's Ball CD out of interest (and my love for the show) only to find out that the song ""Ruin"" by Lamb Of God was on the second disc.4. Finally, with some of my Christmas money, I buy the album, and my expectations were met.5. I saw them at Ozzfest, and found out that they are amazing live.I doubt that this cycle will ever happen to you, but if it does by some miracle, I hope you end up as happy as I was."
3,Lamb of god new CD,Kind of boring lots of potential her but the band still is learning to write songs.
5,"Well done, but...","I really admire LOG's dedication and focus, as well as the social messaging that can occasionally be heard. I do think, however, a little more contast in pace (dare I say it) tunefullness would help."
3,Not their best work,"I would have given this 3.5 stars, if I could. While AtPB has it's moments, the album left me slightly disappopinted, overall. I was told that this was THE Lamb of God album to get. There were a couple of songs I really liked but most were just o.k. I had expected more intereting riff-work. The production seemed off, too; the drums and guitar sound just a touch thin and tinny. AtPB is good but Ashes of the Wake and (to a lesser extent) Wrath are better. If this is your first LOG buy, then get Ashes. Of course, if you're already a LOG fan, you'll probibly find AtPB satisfactory.Recommended (but they have better albums out there). If you don't buy the disc, at least download track #4, ""11th Hour."" It's the best song on there."
4,Melodicly Brutal Metal,"First off, lets say that As The Palaces Burn kills New American Gospel. Props to LoG for out-doing themselves. Second off...As The Palaces Burn kills period. This album is so tasteful yet so melodicly brutal, it will be glued in your cd player for weeks. Lamb of God has a very ""american"" sound hence they're made in the U.S.A. Their sound is hard to describe, but the band itself I think combines Shadows Fall's breakdowns and musicianship with Chimaira's brutalness and Killswitch Engage's melodic guitar work. Its such a grabby album. No matter what style of metal you listen to, I highly recomend this album just because they combine so many styles and they do it so well. You will not be disapointed.Best Song: PurifiedOne Word Review: Diverse"
1,I love bands like these,"Call it what you will...extreme thrash, death metal, speed metal, grindcore...one thing is common among all these genres that Lamb Of God mix together. The lyrics are absolutely indecipherable from beginning to end.I don't know if anybody is actually scared by all this growling (I know that's the intent), but I for one think it's the funniest thing ever. I'm glad to know that if I ever were transformed into a grizzly bear, I could still get a job singing with a metal band.Imagine if these guys sounded like this in your everyday person-to-person communicating:""Thank you for choosing MacDonald's. Can I take your order?""""ARGHARHAHAHRGGHAHRHRHGHGHGAHAHAHAHGGGGRARARARGAGGGAARGAGGGHRGGHHHH!!!""""Okay, I have a side salad, fat free french dressing, a small fry and a frozen yogurt. That'll be $7.63. First window please.""""ARGHGHGGRHRAGRGARRHGHGHGAHAHAGGH!!"""
1,this kind of music is horrible,"Now before you put me as not helpful, hear me out. Randy Blythes singing is so stupid. Ive heard plenty of songs from other ""New Wave of American Metal"" bands, and the singing is similar. The singing pisses me off so much. I got this CD a while ago cause i heards they were good, right? Well, this is the worst CD that i own. The Guitar riffage is pretty good at times, but the singing destroys the fact that the guitar playing is OK. Im sorry to all the fans of this band and the other ""New Wave of American Metal"" followers, but this kind of music is horrible."
4,awsome metal,awsome cd better then the first. When some one I know starts listing to it they can't stop. a must buy for metal fans
2,bathroom sound,"every track on this cd sounds as if it were recorded in a bathroom, a very small bathroom. of course all of it slams and bangs and all of that, but if you plan on listening to it anywhere aside from a pair of headphones, prepare to be embarrased."
2,Out On A Limb,"Ok, I liked the band on the Freddy vs. Jason soundtrack which I recommend so heavily I'd pay like 32$ for it, it's really good BUT the band's CD is far to repetetive its hard to tell the diffrence between songs and I know that sounds like I'm slow but seriously every song sounds the same and I LOVE this kind of music (slipknot, Hatebreed, Etc) but there has to be something in a song that sets it apart from the rest and this album only 2 or 3 songs are noticably diffrent."
1,nothing new,"This is a heavy band (don't get me wrong) but there's nothing drop dead amazing about this band. This is text book death/thrash metal, which is why I give it one star. With the way people make it sound, they talk like this band is breaking new ground or invented an amazing new style of metal, that is not the case. Many may enjoy this album, I mean it is head banging fun, just an ""old"" sound. Upon first listen it's like ""Hey, I've heard this before!"" For something new and imaginative try Meshuggah, Opeth or Origin. :-)"
2,hmmz.. seriously?,"i'm a heavy metal fan, Pantera, in flames, dimmu borgir, CoF and KSE to name a few.and once the bloke below me, said that 11th hour sounded like pantera, i had to download it, to check them out before i bought the album (well that was the original idea)pantera? u gotta be listening to a different band called pantera than i am!i love fast paced guitars, deafening riffs and screaching solos, but the few songs i listened to, had only the speed.in my opinion, if you like want to try these, i would most definately check out In Flames beforehand, they are 5x the band Lamb of god is!just my opinion tho"
2,mainstream and pretty lame,"I give these guys two stars because for mainstream metal, theyre not bad compared to what we had to deal with 5-10 years ago. However, pretty much everything you will hear from them is a watered down version of other metal bands who already existed. The band sounds more like hardcore to me, especially the completely gurgled and screamed vocals. The guitar work is extremely repetitive not to mention I believe lamb of god has the worst guitar tone in the world, way to dry and abrasive. I saw them live and this didn't change, they are a slow band with a horrible tone overall."
4,excellent,"This album is a solid definition of metal. There are no melodies, no soft or tender moments, just straight metal.If you ever listened to new american gospel or burn the priest and enjoyed those albums, this one will not dissapoint at all. If youve been looking for a band that can deliver good ol' metal with no chaser or filler...then look no further"
5,Yeah,"As The Palaces Burn would have to be one of the best compact disk out there. Amazing Riffs, Razorblade Solos, mind blowing drums, this is deffinently a classic"
5,New Metal At It's Best,"Lamb of God's ""As The Palaces Burn"" is one of the bets CDs released in 2003. Randy Blythe is one of my favorite metal vocalists, and everyone else in the band is talented. The guitars kick ass, and sound incredible blended in with Blythe's vocals. Pick this CD up along with the other two Lamb of God titles out: New American Gospel and Ashes of The Wake."
3,This is the best that Martin could do,"I am not a Tony Martin fan at all. I think he has ruined many a Sabbath album and he is mediocre at best. Any album with Ton y singing suffers from weak writing and too much filler. Cross Purposes is about the best effort you can expect from him. I was disappointed to see him rear his head again after the amazing 'Dehumanizer' album, but I guess the egos of Tony Iommi and Dio butted heads again."
1,Aie!!!,"I didn't know what happened to Iommi or the others Black Sabbath member when recording such a disc! Where's the time of Sabotage or Heaven and Hell. For sure, Black Sabbath without Ozzy or Dio looks like a joke."
3,It's okay ...,"Sabbath is a much better band when GeeZ and Tony are together writing the songs.It's just not Sabbath without both of them.This is really the only Tony Martin album I consider to be a real Sabbath album because Geezer isn't on any of the other records Martin recorded with Iommi.There are a few good songs on this CD but this is not one of Sabbath's best,not by a long shot.The first three tracks are great.THe fourth song (Virtual Death) sounds like They were trying to write a radio hit.THis songs sounds ALOT like something Alice in Chains would have recorded.It even sounds like martin is attempting a Layne Staley impersonation.The 5th track ""Immaculate Deception"" is also a very cool,but the album slips away after that song.Tony MArtin has alot more range to his voice than Dio or Ozzy but the melodies he writes are mediocre when compared to The ones Ozzy and Dio write...He's an okay singer If they can't have Dio, Ozzy, or Ian in the band I guess."
2,Too Much Filler,"2.5 stars actually. This cd starts off like a shot. I Witness and Cross of Thorns are quite excellant. Psychophobia is a stand out. Back to Eden has a kick to it... but other than that, there isn't much here. The production is questionable with CoT fading out even as Tony is singing seems a bit odd, it doesn't seem like the song was finished. The sound however is top-notch and can be recommended on that facet and the fact that the price is right. Had more time been spent creating songs that aren't instant throw aways, this cd would be near great. Tony Martins voice is adequate, though generally one dimensional, and Iommi's guitar is a bit watered down, though the playing is quite superb.In the end, this cd represents a lot of highs and lows at a time when music, at least heavy music, was fading fast. If you have Heaven and Hell, burned out Mob Rules, Cross Purposes may be a nice distraction, just get ready to press the 'skip' button on your cd player... a lot."
4,30 black-and-white illustrations,"This is a coloring/storybook for kids under 5 yrs old. There are several different varieties in this Dover Activity series of coloring books. This one happens to be the famous 'Goldilocks and The Three Bears'.Each page features a large black-and-white illustration followed by anywhere from one sentence to a short paragraph explaining the story. The words are big and simple to understand for young readers.At just a buck(Amazon's price), the cover feels solid and not flimsy. Also each page is of adequate quality and won't tear easily from heavy drawing. I also recommend checking out some of Dover's other illustrative coloring books which have more detailed drawings."
1,This is a COLORING BOOK! NOT A STORY BOOK!,This is a COLORING BOOK! It is NOT a story book! The write up is WRONG. I ordered this expecting a STORY book and got a COLORING book! ***DON'T BUY THIS if you want a STORY BOOK!***
3,sounds great,"sounds really great! seems to be made really well, confused though another reviewer said that they last long, too bad it didn't last too long in my case(lasted for like 24 hours)."
3,ehhh ok i guess,Nice Strings...although i wish the top e didn't break so soon. Other than that they play really well on my esp ltd.
4,A enjoyable read!!,This is a good solid entertaining story. I am an avid reader and some books I enjoy more than others. This is one I really enjoyed. I look forward to reading more by this author.
5,decent speakers at an amazing price,"While these are nothing compared to the NHT speakers I have as my fronts, they do a nice job of completing any budget oriented system. They are surprisingly good with filling in the ambience of surround sound from movies and were surprisingly capable when it came to music. I set them up as fronts just to test what they could really do, and they did surprise me a bit. The imaging was ok, along with the mids. They obviously arent supposed to go very low on a bass scale, and their trebel was a bit toned down, but nothing too bad. They might require a bit of break in also, but Im really not sure yet. They were fairly well constructed and ran well off both my receiver and my separate amp. When looking at the price though, there really arent many better deals out there. In this case, I really do think you get MORE than what you pay for."
4,It's not suppose to be like the game,I keep reading Reviews that the Doom Books aren't like the game. And all i can say is...Its not suppose to be like the game. If anything it gave the game a storyline better than the figure it out for yourself shoot everything that moves type game that doom was. I mean you cant say the Doom game had a good storyline because it didnt. All you did was kill things. The book enhanced the game and gave it more of a solid background for a good story. This in my opinion was the best of the Doom Books.
3,"No Ending, Talent Gap Between Authors","The first book--had some creepy scenes, but was damaged by bad sci-fi and, except for ""Your Truly, Fly"", bad characters. There's the strong female character who comes up with a good idea when Fly has a bad idea or a bad idea when Fly comes up with a good idea, and the nerdy computer guy with little to offer in combat, but reveals to them the not-so-very-shocking truth that the brass had been running experiments on teleportation tech for years. This book is plagued by the same flaws as the original. The first book had absolutely NO ENDING WHATSOEVER! and the same applies here. There is also a gap in writing ability between the authors. As I wrote in my review of KDITD, one is mediocre...the other terrible."
5,Excelent a must-have,This is thee book in the series. you can't read on without it because you miss so much if you do skip it.
2,Gettin' iffy,"This book was the point where I started to question what the authors were doing. I love a good alien invasion story, but I found the Doom video games to be more interesting because they weren't exactly aliens; they were something much more frightening. The authors of this novel removed this aspect and tried to put their own spin on the story, thus hurting it. I also didn't find the new characters all that exciting, although I enjoyed the fact that it switched perspective while still remaining in the first person."
1,Doomed from the start.,"I love bargin bins. They're how I obtain most of my books, are often decent quality, and are cheap. And thank god, especially if in between the good ones you manage to pull Hell on Earth. I got this at the same time as the first DOOM novel, and was startled at the differences between them. Knee-Deep In The Dead was a dump fun Aliens rip off that also stuck to the style of the game. Hell On Earth, though, is a lumbering bore, short on plot, character developement, humor and all those other things need to keep this reader awake. To call this a mess would be an understatement."
4,Second and last one worth reading,"Storyline is close to Doom II however, it lacks wits, style and credibility.It is rich with action, even though it gets to be a little repetitive and sometimes even predictable. It has very little substance and I think the author would have done a better job if he didn't try so hard to basically transmute the videogame action into words.All in all, if you're a Doom fan, it's worth the read.Keep in mind this is NOT THE STORY of Doom, as thought by it's creators, iD Software. Rather, it is the author's view."
4,Evil Dead 2 meets Aliens meets Starship Troopers. Again.,"A compelling sequel to the phenominal Knee-Deep in the Dead. Hell on Earth takes place where the last one left off, chronicling the adventures of Fly and Arlene in a post-apocalyptic massacre. This one doesn't follow the game very well, and lacks some of the break neck speed and intensity of the first book, but once it picks up the pace, it rarely lets up. The new characters are interseting (I could have done without the religous discussions, however)as are the situations. This novel does the job it says it will do. Unfourtunatley, the series kinda goes downhill afterwards. A must for fans of the first."
5,"This series of books, especially this one rock.","I believe that, these books are very touching, even in there bloody gore, don't get me wrong the blodd and gore was the best, thing about the books. But at the ending where they go back to Salt Lake somthing like 500 years later, and when they see Jill, and then the box and the simple word Albert sent me bawling. They need a real finale."
1,Cheap Plastic,"I have never had a hole puncher just not work, so this is a first. I have been a teacher for 9 years now. We use hole punchers often. This weak, plastic thing lasted 3 weeks. What a loss of my money. You may be able to see it in the picture that when the handle is pushed down, it would push down on just a thin ledge of plastic. In action, the handle slides right off the plastic ledge and gets caught under it. Just a piece of plastic junk, I can fairly say."
2,Do Not Be Fooled,"This is a fantastic CD...it is over priced, however by about $20. It is available through Family Communications much cheaper."
5,A+ Pliers!,"This is a perfect sized pump pliers, groove joint pliers, Channelocks. (Whatever you want to call it)Very competitively priced, and well made quality tool. This has been my go to pliers as the size is about perfect for any average sized job. I have a very large pliers, this sized pliers, and a small pliers, but this is the one that by far gets the most use.Highly recommended. Excellent price. 5/5 stars!"
5,Nice tool,"I like the handles better than the Channel Lock. It is a good, solid, well-made tool. A good addition to your tool box. You might want to look at the Irwin also, though. It has a push-button adjustment and a differently-shaped jaw. Both are very nice tools. You won't go wrong by getting this one."
4,Good Pliers - MADE IN CHINA,These are good Pliers - but I am so tired of buying goods made in ChinaAs an informed consumer I will be confirming country of manufacture in the futureI know it may cost me more money - but I would rather buy less made in USA than more made in China
5,great tool,These are my favorite grips in the tool box and work really good and look great even when covered in dirt.The slip joint type are easy to use and give good tension along with the teeth ensuring a tight hold on many materials.The life time warranty is a bonus but after some serious hard use and conditions mine still show no sign of abuse and are easy to clean as they do not rust.The grip handle is a good thickness preventing slipping in the hand and feels comfertable whilst being used.Overall if you need a this tool I would recommend this product for long term value for money.
5,NUTS,"I bought there pliers to remove a couple tight nuts that I could not remove with an old pair. These pliers are very smooth, and have a very comfortable grip. They are a must for any tool box. These pliers come in handy when working around the house. I also have they 8 inch stanley pliers which help when working on my car.A great pair of pliers for a great price!"
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD. Fallen, Not Forgotten and It's an honor to serve are the best. All the other ones are good, in the typical Ray Boltz style. This CD is worth getting! Another patriotic song or two would have earned the CD 5 stars."
5,A UNIQUE CHRISTIAN AETISTS,"Im a new comer to ray's music but have stumbled on what I believe is one of the most talented christian perfomers in the world, his caring and humanity side focuses into his music and carries out his feelings all to well. He will be around forever......"
5,Dare To Believe - what a challenge and encouragement,"The first song, Dare to Believe is such a testament to the power of God. I came across this CD at a time in my life where I am holding on to an ""impossible"" promise from God but was starting to lose hope. Praise God that ""mountains still move""."
4,They did it again.,"Once again Full Cycle's shown why they're one of the top and most respected labels out there. A fresh, new style that only Kamanchi could've created. You can hear the different personalities of Die and Krust in the tracks, but they make it work perfectly. Tali and Violet did a great job as well. I wish there were more rhymin', but it's still a very good album."
4,A very different and informative work.,"If you are interested in history, treasure hunting, diving, or true life adventure stories, you will enjoy this book! Meticulously researched and intertainingly presented."
2,Simple and Unrealistic!,"""High Five"" is yet another over-simplified book with a kid's storyline that may work on the school playing field, but to intelligent adult employees it is just an unrealistic phrase thoughtlessly spouted at those well-intentioned leadership/teamwork meetings. My co-workers and I have found that genuine teamwork, especially management/employee teamwork, requires far more than just a short kid's story to be successful. Having read the hilarious and witty-sharp satire, ""MANAGEMENT BY VICE"", we all agreed that the naive concept of ""High Five"" teamwork is actually just a ""Management Spoof"" -- one of the many real-life eye-openers in ""Management by Vice"", where you'll find out for yourself what truly needs to be addressed to make teamwork a company success!"
1,Over hyped and under substanced,"Don't waste your money! This... ripoff reads like a 3rd grade think-and-do book. Blanchard makes up a little story about a star performer who loses his job, sees the light and buys into the group think of teamwork. Someone needs to tell Blanchard that in the real word, individual performance gets the bucks, not teamwork. He hides behind the innocence of a kids hockey team to drive home his simplistic solution of how team fixes all. In the real leagues, Mr. Blanchard, a hockey player's salary is not dependent on how well he plays as a team member, but on just how skilled he is at hogging the puck and making the goal. Corporate America works the same way. When is someone going to write a book about that?"
4,High Five- Teamwork,"I couldn't put the book down. I love reading Ken Blanchards books; I have been doing alot of what he has put into his books for over 20 years. I have seen the results and it works. I wish many people would read these books and use the information. The books are easy reading and you will find yourself going back to the books to make sure you didn't miss anything. thanks to Ken and the others who have put together these books. I look forward to reading more of them. I also suggest reading ""Gung Ho"" and ""Whale Done""."
3,A SIMPLE book on teamwork..,If youve read any management books or come from a business background then this book isnt of much value. This book would suit someone who runs or manages a business but is missing management theory.
4,Good read on the strength of teamwork and working,"together toward a common goal. Nice reference for gaining team support and understanding that there is no ""I"" in team. As a manager, if you are working with a group that does not align properly this is worth recommending."
1,For the simple minded only - and not in a good way,"This book is a utopian, unrealistic, poorly thought-out, infantile piece of trash. It's an insult to the intelligence of any adult who reads it. Written at a third grade level with 16-point type, this book's contents would be better suited to a coloring book. The philosophy it presents a real no-brainer, and if you need to read this to learn these principles, you have bigger problems to worry about. The ""story"" is just that, a ""story"" - there isn't an ounce of truth or realism to it, so just file this book under ""office fairy tales"". Believe it or not, I'm not a pessimist, I love books, and I'm totally into ""self/professional improvement"" topics. But do not waste your time or money on this silly book."
5,Gung Ho! for High Five,"A great book for not only the blue collar workers but the ivory tower group (especially) as well. Blanchard and Company again take a complicated subject such as teamwork and make it so simple by putting it in a parable format. Once the reader sees how these timeless principles apply to a 5th grade hockey team, Alan applies the same principles in his work life.This would be a great read for our kid's coaches too!"
4,Great Story,"If you are an Anglophile, you will treasure this book for the tidbits of social history , as well as the adventure story. The only problem I had that without a knowledge of England's seacoast geography and sailing terms,I was a little puzzled at times. But this was a fast and exciting read for the most part.I also recommend ""In The Heart of The Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex by Nat. Philbrick"
5,A Great Adventure Read,I found this to be an extremely well written account of a compelling story. A difficult book to put down. If you enjoy adventure reading you will love this book.
2,Writing went down with the ship.,"Hanson has spun a very interesting, compelling and thought provoking story into a boring yarn. The book simply reads like a novel (rather than history) written by a college sophomore in a seminar class. Hanson fills the story early on with useless details that never materialize to bear any relevance on the story. He seems only to be trumpeting the depth of his research without putting it to much use. His prose is thin and uninspired. One of the two most interesting aspects, the ""at sea"" portion of the story, is brief and contains little of the overwhelming drama it suggests. There is little exploration of the characters. Even the chapter listing other stories of cannibalism at sea are rattled off as if taken directly from research notes with little thought given to their place or purpose in the story. Some portions, such as verbatim trial testimony and factual background of the political and legal climate were enlightening."
5,Great Read,"I loved this book. It has everything, adventure at sea, courtroom drama and it is a true story. I couldn't put it down!"
1,not worth the money;no price changes since last 1997,I only wish that I could buy at the so -called worth(prices) in this book. The authors are obviously oblivious to the prices that wristwatches are bringing on the internet/e-bay.
4,Complete price guide to watches,"A good source for information but to refer to the guide as ""complete"" would be streching it a bit."
5,Watches,"This is a very complete guide to watches, has excellent explantions within which is very helpful in understanding watches over the last 4 centuries. Good illustrations, nice layout which is fairly easy to follow. There is a lot of information on US watches and a light overview on watches manufactured in other countries. This is a great book for anyone interested in collecting or restoring watches, actually it is a must."
1,If this is no better than the 2001 edition ...a travesty,"I own the 2001 edition, which is awkwardly written, very poorly edited, and difficult to use as a reference. Many photos appear to be xeroxes of movements rather than photos, and are illegible. Many actual photos are of such poor quality as to be essentially useless. There is no index, no attempt to provide cross-reference material (such as calibres common to a set of watches). Even the table of contents contains an error.This book often gives the appearence of being thrown together solely as a vehicle for the many advertisements from various watch sellers that appear within it.A much better method of pricing watches - more accurate, colorful and more up-to-date - would be to look at auction catalogs.Not recommended."
4,Excellent Collector Reference,"More watches than any other source (average to poor photos). Extensive reference for American and Swiss wrist and pocket watches. Known as the King of watch price guides and sometimes known for undervaluing watches, especially rare models. This years book has new, updated values and even more photos. A must have, even for knowledgable collectors."
2,Complete Price Guide to Watched,"this guide is not complete, of poor print quality, and is poorly organized. Values quoted provide comparison benchmarks but reliabilty is questionable."
1,"Misguided by the ""Guide""","This book falls short of what I would call a ""Guide"". The name is the first MISGUIDE!. I looked for information on watches from 2003 as implied on the cover! which has a brand new UN Freak. There are no 2003 watches listed in this book. The book seems to be a reprint of the first edition from 1969 based on the infromation listed. The photos are primitive. Look in the Word Pronunciation section and you will find nurmerous watch companies left out. For example, ""Hublot"" In fact, Hublot, Chronoswiss, Mido, Oris and many others are left out all together! I am very disappointed with this ""Guide"". If I could only ""Turn back the hands of time....."""
5,An old standby continues moving along,This used to be considered the bible of pricing of vintage watches - it is a tremendous piece of work - however many models are missing and pricesneed updating as the economy has changed very much in a few short years.However for the beginner there is no better book to learn and havea handy reference to save money and not lose it when buying an old watch
1,Not useful,Not even close to real market prices. Many well known swiss manufacturers are very sub represented (i.e. Ebel).
4,Price Guide for Watch Collectors,"The book was helpful in determining the rarity of certain old watches. Prices on ebay seem a bit higher than what this book indicates, so if someone is trying to find the actual value of a watch, they may be a little disappointed. This book is a good reference for watch collectors."
3,"a lot of very good information, but rather difficult to use","Clearly an exellent work that is desirable to all collectors. However, there is so much information that is is somewhat difficult to access -it should have a substantial index overhall and expansion so that it is listed by alpha, brand name, topic, serial nos, usa, uk, germ, switz, etc. with duplicated items. Every time you use the book you find a page that is usefull that you did not know was there. No one has the time to read the whole book, so its efficiency is key to its user value and should be updated. i should be able to go to the index and see ""patek philippe serial numbers"" or ""hamilton repeater values"" or ""english fusee makers"" or ""railroad ...., and see a page number(s). I would also like to see the 0 to 5 star assignment to all items over 500.00 dlrs based on potential feature value to serious collectors and dealers. But, it is still a great book for twenty bucks!"
4,Conflicts of Interest?,"One of the best watch books around, it basically plods along, virtually unchanged, year, after year. Except for price updates, and a new cover every year, this book is getting long in the tooth. My main problem is realistic pricing, which would not serve the authors, primarily Tom Engle, who is a high-end watch dealer. Many items are underpriced, in my opinion, and do not reflect real world pricing."
2,"An interesting guide, but limited in scope....","This would be a wonderful book for pocketwatch collectors (very extensive & informative), but for wristwatch lovers it leaves a bit to be desired. Includes a rather brief history & the watches shown/priced cater mainly to the male buyer. I'd honestly hoped more vintage ladies watches would be listed in this guide."
2,"not structured, not complete, not up to date","This book might be interesting if you're specialised in low-range US brands of wirstwatches or pocketwatches. The sheer number of hamilton, elgin and bulova models listed is surprising. If you collect rather on the high-end, you'll be very disappointed though. Missing information on calibers, important makes and models that are not listed at all, poor photographs, and the lack of structure of the model-listing are some of the major downsides of the book. No serious editor would publish this level of information quality. (The author is his own publisher)"
2,Lots of pictures and some useful pocket watch info but ...,"for real world prices, the guide is utterly useless, particularly for valuing wrist watches.It may have been a decent first stab when it came out 20 years ago, but many of the prices have not changed since then.Authors: wake up and smell the coffee!"
1,Worthless in many aspects.,"Complete Price Guide to Watches 2008.This said guide is quite inacurate, the authors just copied the same old stuff of previous books and tried to imitate the real stuff that their competitors do, I am referring to the rel thing, that is titled and has been ""number one"" for many years: WRIST WATCH PRICE GUIDE, by Sherry & Roy Ehrhardt and Joe DeMesy.Some of the prices of wrist watches are just plain lies, plaese take a look at page 1086 and you can see the STOWA 20-221 Military watch. Ca. 1942 at the incredible price from $400 to $800 dollars. This is just a plain lie, this watch, if you ever find one, costs aroun 5 to 10,000 dollars.What do this people think, that is the publishers of this so called price guide,about the people that buy this worthless, that we are morons?. I am so sorry to have waisted my time and money on a piece of printed junk...A very disatisfied reader...Jose Casas"
2,"Detailed watch price guide, but not complete","This item is very detailed and contain a lot of watches in it, but it is not so complete. It did not list any recent models, which was what I was originally looking for. However, it is an excellent guide for antique watches."
3,"Detailed, VERY detailed","Specialised appeal, but invaluable for collectors and dealers. Too much reference to pocket watches and American watches for my taste. Insufficient details on recent models also, but minor gripes for such a solid reference."
3,very good but.......,"...it could have been more comprehensive. since i do not collect pocket watches, i don't have the need or knowledge for that part of the book. which is quite a bit of the book. nonetheless, all information is good information. as far as the wristwatches, a lot of the newer models of established brands are not included and some brands are missing altogether. this i find to be a shortcoming for a most recent edition of a book dedicated to watches. would have also liked to see a more complete and detailed listing on comic character watches. needless to say, i collect these.would i recommend this book? yes, while adding the above caveat. the price for the book is not unreasonable. so give it 3 1/2 stars in my estimation."
3,So-so,"I bought this to locate a Gruen watch but I couldn't find it in this book.Also it doesn't list any low price watches such as Timex, Seiko, etc."
5,Price Guide for Watches,I got this for my husband to use in our business. He says it's been very helpful. I got it to update his old one.
1,Complete Price Guide to Watches: Thousands of Price Changes,"Disappointing. Misleading. Complete means complete watches, that is not parts there of. All prices are for sales in the USA. Very few European watches.If you like American watches it is OK if you realise that there is life outside the USA - forget it. Don not spend the money."
1,It's a shame!,"I've opened this book since some hours and I still have difficulties in understanding the order in which information is gathered and ordered. It's a real mess. Many important brands are missing (for example and don't see any Westclox or Timex wristwatches), watches are ordered without any serious criteria but their brand, unrelated information is put togheter and much much worse than I can tell. Imagine you put some thousands photocopies in a box and after some years you get them out of it and publish them. Is it a book? No, it's a shame. JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Cannot play on CD Walkman,"Got this to help me unwind and fall asleep...but I cannot listen to it on portable, it won't play on it.Kinda defeats the purpose to have to get out of bed just when you're nodding off to sleep (finally).Please CHANGE security protection codes this is bad!!!"
5,Perfect,"I really wanted to put my TV/computer on the other side of the room, but my baseboards are very tight to the carpet, and I couldn't get a regular coaxial under them. This was just perfect. I haven't had any slow down in internet speed. Very satisfied."
4,Great for running along the baseboard,"Was searching for a longer coax to run along the baseboard when I stumbled onto this thinner version. A few reviews I read mentioned some issues with HD signal but I am here to report no problems at all!I do wish it was a ""tangle free"" cord but other than that it gets the job done just fine but more discreetly."
1,Cable box DID NOT WORK,"I thought I was smart to think I could get this thin video cable to run under my rug for my cable box. Sad to say I was not so smart after all. It's a pain setting up new cable service to begin with, but having it not work because of this cable that I went out of my way to buy makes it worse. Don't waste your money, the cable technician laughed at me when he compared this video cable to his."
5,Butt Saver,"I moved to an apartment which has antenna jacks on the wrong walls for where I want my gear. Running coax up and over or under is ugly or hard on the feet. This stuff works great, it can tuck under baseboards, route around door case and run under carpet without a hitch. I have HDTV and cannot see any loss compared to the regular RG58.My wife, however notices the lack of cables all around the house!High SAF very Flexible and seems Durable as well[...]"
5,Ultra thin coaxial cable,Product worked fine on small 720p flatscreen. Noticed no reduction in signal at all and cable easy to work with and hide.
5,Truly Amazing!,"Just saw this Nova episode on PBS but it won't be available on amazon.com until January 2010, and it was astounding. Photographic quality is first-rate, images from the telescope/camera are gorgeous, and you really do get to know many of the people involved - those who perform the miracles on the ground and in space.I give the ""plot"" my highest praise: this is better than ""Ice Road Truckers."" And even though I knew the outcome of the project, I was on the edge of my seat through the entire program. The whole repair job depends on every tiny little detail, including 150 screws, each of which could ruin the project if the head is stripped... and you know how easily that happens.Humor, pathos, outstanding teamwork and creativity... I could - and will - watch this again. The only question left unanswered was how the astronauts go to the bathroom in their spacesuits during an eight-hour spacewalk (I couldn't help it - I'm a retired middle school teacher)."
4,Funny store about what happens when the actors take over the play mid-performance,"Well, what do you expect when you work with kids? The producer is intent on performing three dark and dreadful versions of three very grim fairy tales, but the kids have their own ideas, producing fairy godmothers, giant bunnies, and happy endings galore.There's no deep meaning or message, it's just a bit of fun."
4,Just as good as Tiffanys,The design is remarkable with no flaws. It carries a decent amount of business cards. It snaps and opens with ease. I also own a Tiffanys Sterling Silver business card holder and I can easily compare the two besides the $200 difference. This holder is definetely an eye catcher!
5,Sprott's Memoir: Good Read and Resource,"This is an excellent primary source for a soldier's eye view of the daily experinece of the civil war. Unembelished with romantic bravado or the mythology of causes, Captain Samuel Sprott's journal of the experiences of the 40th Alabama regiment presents the reality of war for the common soldier- general bordome and petty detail alongside short episodes of battle, tragedy, and confusion. Smith and Quist do an excellent job of providing essential supporting information in the preface and appendix while avoiding the temptation to intrude upon Sprott's narrations. The book should be a hit in the classroom as a primary document that is brief, easy to read, and relatively inexpensive. For the same reasons it is recommended to the general reader."
5,Just Gorgeous!,"Tokyo Live which I missed that night - Life time regret for a Tokyo resident!In short, put essence of Genesis, Asia, King Crimson and GTR in a bowl and mix well - this is it.Steve on a variety of guitars and vocal, John Wetton on Bass and Vocal, Ian MacDonald on guitar/keyboard/flute and Julian Colbeck on main keyboard.Just for ""Watcher of the Sky"" performed by this member is worth buying. (I prefer this version over original Genesis version.)""Heat of the moment"" acoustic version is also one of the collector's items."
3,Great pictures,"Along with Tops and Bottoms, this book by Janet Stevens is wonderful. The illustrations are wonderful in portraying the animal's character. I would recommend telling the story by using some of your own words and the pictures. Some of the words are too harsh for a young child. This story is great for predicting the next event besides giving a lesson about greed."
5,much ado about nothing,"This story was hilarious. I began reading it to my second graders and they didn't want to leave when the bell rang. They wanted to stay for the finish. The curiosity of the prairie dogs was believable and as always, Janet Stevens' illustrations were wonderful. It was very creative to see the ways the little guys could use the ""fuzz"". Loved it."
3,The Ninja Returns,Great movie with a lot of action.I was disappointed that the DVD had nothing in the way of deleted scenes.
1,One of the worst Ninja movies ever,"Pure 80s Japexploitation film. Storyline is crappy, plot is crappy, acting is crappy, character development is crappy, the only thing good is Sho Kosugi's karate prowess. The blonde bimbo does show her boobies at one point, but otherwise not worth the price of admission.I can think of only one Ninja film I hate more, American Ninja with Michael Dudikoff, that one is really bad."
1,Worst action and plot,"This was slow, pathetic, and laughable. I really laughed at it! the music was terrible and the action was unrealistic. and the most ridiculous part was when the big guy was chasing the kid, the kid pointed out a window and said ""look superman!"" and the big guy said ""where? Where?"" and the kid then hit him..!"
4,Ashley Ferrare does Pantyhose Karate !!! YEEEEEEAaaah,The thing I remember most about this movie when I first saw it in the 80's on cable tv was the part where Cathy in the film played by Blonde floozy Ashley Ferrare does a Karate work out with Sho Kosugi and when she does her first series of high kicks the viewer thinks she is wearing nothing under her Karate top but upon closer inspection you can Easily see that she is wearing a flesh colored pair of pantyhose w/out panties underneath and her crotch is covered tastily by the pantyhose.I thought this was the Most erotic martial arts scene between a man and woman ever at the time !!! Its still kind of Sexy to watch ~ Mmmmmm
2,It's so bad it's funny,It has porn movie acting without the porn. And my fave part of the movie is when the hero and his mate who's a cop beat up on some gang members who look and awful lot like the Village people. It get two star from me as it's so bad it's hilriously funny.
5,"Excellent overview of Turbos, despite being dated","This book is out of date! Many things have changed since 1984. A new revision is called for... Nonetheless, the book covers most subjects very well, although the technical detail drops sharply after the first chapter or two. Very valuable information about turbo sizing and matching, different configurations, bi- and tri- (yes) turbos, intercooling, aftercooling, water injection, oiling, exhaust... All this information is as relevant as ever. If only the technical detail have been kept throughout the book... As an American book, it uses the Imperial measurement system (CFM/PSI/CID etc.) exclusively! Metric favourites beware... A very good section in the end about problems and troubleshooting. If you're interested in turbos, go and buy it.Danny Halamish"
4,useful,"Using only this book as an information source, I succeeded in my goal of converting a diesel camper engine to a turbo diesel, increasing power by 35% while decreasing the operating temperature. Hugh MacInnes gives excellent explanations of turbo theory, practice, and real world rules of thumb. He tells you how to perform the necessary math to match a turbo to an engine, as well as providing simplified graphs for math-phobics. I agree with some other reviewers that the book badly needs updating and expanding. I feel it has been edited a bit too severely. One of the few ""how to"" books I have that actually tells you how to."
2,A disappointment,"This book is great, filled with a ton of great info.... if your looking for state of the art in 1984. Throughout the book, the author gives examples of what is ""state of the art""... almost 20 years ago.... most of which has been improved upon. If your just looking for concepts, then this book might be worth your time. However, if your looking for more pretinent info for now, I suggest Corky Bell's ""Maximum Boost"" or Earl Davis' ""Superchargers, TurboChargers, and Nitrous Performance Handbook""."
3,worth it,"This book surely increased my limited knowledge greatly. Certainly it is dated, but still relevant in many ways. As an owner of a couple turbo-charged Corvairs, I benefited from some of MacInnes' special attention to these engines. An updated version would be very welcome. Well written, perhaps lacking a total technical/ mathematics over-view."
2,Really Outdated,"This book is okay to buy if you plan on turbo charging a old carburated car. No info on fuel injection,or computer control. Actually the information given in the book is primative and was written before the first car that had even the most simple fuel injection. I would reccomend instead of buying this book, buy 'Maximum Boost' by Corky Bell."
2,"Dry, boring, and outdated","If you bought an antique turbo and want to know everything about it, this is the book for you. If you have a newer car with a turbo, then pass this one over. It was a big disappointment. Why did I waste my money? Get Maximum Boost instead."
1,Turbo What?,"Unfortunately I was not aware that this book was published in 1984, and as a result much of the information is dated & does not relate to current vehicles & EFI systems.The sizing section is not particularly informative."
2,THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!!!,"I BOUGHT 3 BOOKS THIS ONE, TURBOCHARGERS STREET TURBOCHARGING AND .AND OUT OF ALL THOSE THE BEST IS MAXIMUM BOOST AND STREET TURBOCHARGING IS PRETY GOOD TOO .-BUT THIS BOOK(TURBOCHARGERS) IS SUCH A OLD NEWS, COMPLETELY OUT DATED, JUST LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND YOU WON'T EVEN WANT TO READ IT, IT IS BORING AND REALLY SUCKS!!!!BUT IN THE OTHER HAND,MAXIMUM BOOST HAS SUCH AN EXCELLENT, DETAIL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION.YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS BOOK, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!-STREET TURBOCHARGING IS THE SECOND IN LINE AND STILL PRETY GOOD"
4,Oldie but Goody,"Hugh MacInnes was a first-rate automotive engineer and car guy who had ""been there, done that"" with turbochargers and turbo projects, and this book is packed with good stuff about all kinds of turbochargers and turbo engines. There is even interesting stuff in here about turbo aircraft, two-strokes, and much more. There is also some nice turbo history, and it is interesting to see the return in modern times of older ideas--like water-cooled turbos and ball-bearings. Anyone who is really interested in automotive technology will enjoy this book. Keep in mind, it was last updated a long time ago (late 80's?), so there is too much about carburetors and too little about elecronic fuel injection and engine managemant. But for real gearheads that won't matter: Have we lost all interest in steam locomotives because there are now diesels? I think not."
2,For Carbed cars only!,"This book is not comprehensive whatsoever. It includes severe factual errors in regards to fuel injected cars as a result of being extremely outdated. Recommended solutions to issues when turbocharging fuel injected cars could be hazardous to your cars health. I suppose if you had a carburated car, this would be a great book. Expect about 20% of the total book to be applicable to newer cars. Almost none of that 20% is actually useful, just simple theory and brief ""explainations"". Check out Corky Bell's book if you don't have a carburated car."
2,mediocre turbo book,This book has little in depth technical discussion. The content is vague and too general for practical use. The best this book had to offer was a general understanding of turbochargers.
4,Turbochargers book,It was just what my husband wanted and much less cost than I could find in the local automotive stores.
4,NOT QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED BUT EXCELLENT NONE THE LESS.,"THIS BOOK WAS NOT COMPLETELY WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT IF I HAD TOOK THE TIME TO RESEARCH A LITTLE BIT MORE I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.THAT BEING SAID, IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE,ON DIFFERENT TURBOCHARGING SYSTEMS , BUT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR HOW TO TUNE TURBOS THE BOOK IS LIMITED."
5,Ric's Best Solo Album,"I really like this album. Every son is catchy, and I never get tired of listening to it. There was only one charted hit from the album, ""Emotion in Motion"". But my favorite is the title track. A quiet, synthesized song that I find fascinating."
5,Masterpiece,This is Ocasek's MASTERPIECE!!!! There isn't really anything else that needs to be said. Incredible sound. DEEP resonating tone. An EXPERIENCE!!!!
5,catching up with old friends,I had this album on a tape years ago and now it's great to have it on CD. The disc and box are in excellent condition and the CD arrived in super-quick time.
5,One of my favorite albums ever...,Timeless music. To me this album is his best work. Love every song on it and know them all by heart I've listened to it so much over the years. Originally had it on cassette back in the 80's and am so happy to have it again and on CD.
3,"Started off strong, but finished off weak.","1986's ""This Side Of Paradise"" #52, was 37 year old Ric Ocasek's 2nd solo album. The first four songs on the album all had that classic Cars sound, you get ""Keep On Laughin'"", one of Ric's best, ""True To You"", #75 hot 100 and #9 mainstream rock, the classic ballad ""Emotion In Motion"", #15 hot 100 #1 mainstream rock and #8 a.c. and ""Look In Your Eyes"", the rest of the disc is just subpar. Ric would return in 5 years with his next solo release."
3,"Good album, but not his best...","To date, Ric Ocasek has released 6 albums as a solo artist: ""Beatitude"", ""This Side of Paradise"", ""Fireball Zone"", ""Quick Change World"", ""Troublizing"", and ""Nexterday"". All of them unique onto themselves. Fans must remember however, that Ric Ocasek is not The Cars. Therefore, fans should stop comparing his solo work to that of The Cars which is a group effort.I have to admit, my all time favorite album of Mr. Ocasek's is his first, ""Beatitude"". From start to finish, I enjoy each and every track. No need for skipping any one song. They're all great.My least favorite Ric Ocasek album is ""Fireball Zone"". There's maybe 2 tracks I like on that album.If I had to list his albums from most favorite (and most played with the least amount of skipping a track) to least favorite, the order would go something like this:1)""Beatitude""2)""This Side of Paradise""3)""Quick Change World""4)""Troublizing""5)""Nexterday""6)""Fireball Zone"""
2,No New Sounds,"If this album had come out in 1980 it probably would have been a smash, but the world has long since passed Ocasek by, somebody should wake this guy up."
3,Weird with a capital weeee...,"I'm still not sure how I feel about Necrom. There were a lot of loose ends that don't seems to make much sense, but it was funny and weird enough in places that it kept me interested. Let's face it, you can't get much stranger than an over the hill rock star, kidnaped by an assortment of fun lovin' demons and high-tech Aztechs, being dragged kicking and screaming across multiple dimensions to help wake up an (the) elder god."
4,"A spiritual, drug induced romp through time and space.","Over-age rocker, against his will, travels time and space to save. . .time and space. The old god wakes, and last time he was around, he was pissed off. Our hero has adventures with drugs, flakes, good music, deamons and police-from-beyond . It's a romp and a guilty pleasure to read"
2,"No plot, little fun, rehashed story-line","The usual Mick-style ""Tour of the Universe"" adventure story plus a little Cthulhu mythos cross-over. Not done well, however, No or little plausible plot, unconvincing paranoia, stop-start scripting, unconvincing characters acting out unconvincing story-line, in general poor handling of dramatic tension. No climax. Stereotypical hackwork. A long long way down from, Phaid the Gambler, Mars The Red Planet or the DNA Cowboys. I only tolerated this because I am a die-hard far-right fanatical fundamentalist Mick Farren Fan. Sorry, Mick, not one of your better days, I am afraid.Visit Mick's webpagehttp://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/"
1,Remakes,"Later in his career Charley Pride did a massive recording session where he re-recorded all his biggest hits.At the time it was well intentioned because almost all of the original versions of these songs were unavailable.But be forewarned, the songs on this disc are all remakes."
4,"Best of the Best, Charley Pride","I try to maintain an eclectic collection of classic--and to a limited degree, contemporary-- country music and the above listed CD is within the top ten of my CDs reflecting that era. I believe Charley Pride is one of the top ten country artists."
3,Tranter Lite,"A nice cliff notes version of the lives of Marie de Guise, wife and widow of King James V of Scotland, and her daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Both women struggled to reign and rule in Scotland which is difficult at the best of times through history but this as Catholics during the Reformation and as Women which has been unheard of in Scotland. Both women are tragic and portrayed doing their best. The book is 200 pages long and leaves 100 pages for each woman covering the highlites of their lives. Tranter gives us many of the facts and events with a few pages of 1st person dialogue. A lot of the book seems like a review or frame work for something which could have been fleshed out into a couple of novels or even trilogy. I was not drawn into their lives like the characters of previous Tranter books. A nice review of the period but from the surface perspective."
2,Meatloaf & Friends,good music but the track did not line up to the listing of songs. They were all out of order.
3,new layout,"this one has a new layout, and i don't like it. it has a week on two pages, so the first page, on the left side, has monday. in the middle of the page, it's tuesday. on the right side of the page, it's wednesday. very skinny vertical columns. hard to write anything. i am disappointed."
2,Disappointing.,"I love the size of the little Moleskine notebooks, and the pocket in the back, and the elastic closure that keeps it from getting wrinkled, but the datebook has a truly terrible layout. I was hoping for something like the FiloFax week on two pages layout, but this, as the previous reviewer described, is very awkward to use. The long, skinny columns, tiny type and difficult-to-find month names make this a truly annoying day planner. The removable address section is a nice touch, though.Unless you're determined to have everything Moleskine, stick to the notebooks and address book (awesome!) and give the weekly diary a miss."
3,*cry* bring back the columsn & times,i LOVED the skinny columns broken down by time. it was so helpful for blocking out appointments throughout my day and prevented me from double booking.
1,Check it out first,"This particular item is on a few web-sites available for sale, one site has almost all of the tracks able to be previewed.Many, and I mean many are yes, the original artists. But, the tracks are re-recordings of their original efforts which we remember and loved and do not sound as we remember them.Unfortunately this is just another title amongst the hundreds available that with the advertising, you think you are getting the original originals, but alas you are not!"
3,Mold and mildew resistant mat,"I've been using this mat for about a month or so and did check peridicaly for mold ,so far so good. It doubles as massager for your feet. Will buy it again when needed.07/01/2012 Revision. Now my mat is growing mold. Apparently it only can resist for a some time not forever :( so my next step in preventing slipping in a shower is some stick on funny little shapes or something."
3,Not as expected,"First, know that this mat is a bit different. It doesn't have the usual suction cups on the bottom, but rather is sort of domed on the top. When you press down as instructed, it does stick to the tub, but the little domes feel odd on your feet at first and take a bit of getting used to.My family is horrible about pulling up the mat and rinsing it after showering, so that's why I was looking for a mold and mildew resistant mat. After about a week, the mat was pinkish on both the top and bottom. Using a bleach-based cleaner, I was able to scrub the color off of the top, but the bottom is permanantly stained. I can live with that, but just know that it may not be as resistant as they claim. At least the top looks good."
4,Mold resistant bath mat,This mat really eliminates the need for constant cleaning of mold and mildew. This has remained clean and mold/mildew free.
4,Good supplement for those in need,"This book unlike most of Princeton's Reviews others is a good review of the material that you need to cover to get a good score on the AP exam. For me it wasn't so much helpful since my teacher prepared us extremely well(5 on test), but i know it helped some of my friends from other schools who weren't as lucky."
2,cracking the ap chemistry exam,The book was written in - in PEN! All the answers ! It made for a waste of time and money to get a book you could not use as a study tool.
5,AP Chemistry,"This book is an excellent review source for the AP Chemistry exam. I was very satisfied with the material. The only problem noted was that the free response section of the review is not in the current format of the test. The material, however, is relevant. Would highly recommend this book!"
2,Laced with Modernist Heresy,"The book is well written, and it does contain much that is commendable. However, as with much of the post Vatican II Catholic church, it is rife with the Modernist heresy (yes, it was formally declared to be heresy -- indeed, the synthesis of all heresies) and the faint stench of Marxist liberation theology is discernable. Pre Vatican II this would have been branded heretical; post Vatican II, it may even be considered somewhat conservative in some circles."
1,Disappointed Long Time Customer,"I have used ACT since the first version in the 80's. I tried all the others thoroughly and had settled on Act for the last 5 years and was HAPPY. I decided to upgrade from 6.0 after assurances from the salesman online that my Act for Palm OS would work in the new version. It does not. I have been trying to figure out what the advantages are for ACT 2005. So far NONE. The ACT for Palm Link is terrible. You can't even read past a few letters of the record to know what you are looking at. They need to get their ""act"" together FAST."
4,Good historical reference.,First viewed at library and later decided to purchase own personal copy. The book provided a lot of information with a number of photos.
4,Classic Spinning Top,"I purchased several different spinning tops for my grandchildren at Christmas. This top by Bolz is easy to operate and makes a fun humming sound. It seems very durable and they are still dragging it out to play with it. It doesn't require batteries, a controller or anything fancy. The kids give it a couple of pushes on the top and it goes. Probably not much educational value - just old time fun."
3,"Interesting, but ...","The scientific material Dawkins covers is interesting and quite well presented. As a scientist, he writes surprisingly well; he is certainly very readable. I question, however, if using Chaucer's Canterbury Tales as a format was necessary or helpful. By eliminating that artificial scheme, he probably could have included many more fascinating and poorly known (to the lay reader) stories. The inclusion of several almost vituperative political rantings causes me to rate this book lower than it otherwise deserves. Whether the reader agrees or disagrees with his views (and I admit I do not) a book popularizing science is no place for them. It is surprising that his editor or publisher did not insist on its deletion."
3,Evolutionary anthopology and DNA research,"A very important contribution to the evolutionary research. Dawkins explains complicated ideas in a simle and pristine way. He, as most of evolutionary anthropologists explains the evolution of species on current DNA research. What is missing in this book is the critical ideas about the sientific DNA techniques and its limitations. Although DNA techniques can be usefull in some applications, it should never be used to explain all evolution (and behaviour) of species in technical/chemical terms.DNA techniques gives only indications of some evolutionary issues but it can never be used without sound sientific philosophical analysis. DNA analysis without critical philosophical evaluation is worthless.George SoronisPhD"
3,Fact or Fiction?,"I have some reservations, but I moderately enjoyed this book. I guess not every scientist can write like Steve Pinker or Brian Greene. I found that Dawkins wandered much too often into areas beyound his area of expertise, usually to interject his left wing politics. I think scientists are best when they talk about science and leave the politics to the politicians. To claim that President Kennedy was intelligent and President Bush is dumb, is his opinion, not science.-Frank"
2,Should have been a classic,This book should have been a classic. Richard Dawkins can't resist telling us his political views on issues like the war in Iraq that are largely irrelevant to this book. These comments are annoying to read right now and will make the book very dated in a few years. Dawkins should have stuck with the scientific story he was trying to tell.
5,I'm one of those,"I'm one of those people who buy books in hopes of reading them in the near future. I'm in grad school doing lots of science reading and I have very little time for leisure reading. I'm getting to it, I'm getting to it cuz i wanna read it someday soon."
3,"Decent, but at times a little verbose","Richard Dawkins is a brilliant evolutionary biologist, but I found this work a little verbose. He tends to rush over some topics, yet go into minute details in others. It's not bad, but stick with his more noted works."
4,A Lengthy But Worthy Tale!,"This book has been written with the general audience in mind, nonetheless, the subject matter of the book can be technical and dry at times. However, should one give the 600 plus pages a pensive read, one is bound to learn more about modern Zoology/Evolutionary Biology than he/she has possibly bargained for. My last Zoology course was over 25 years ago as an undergraduate, and I am simply in awe of how much our knowledge base in this area has changed since then.I particularly enjoyed Dr. Dawkins eloquent discussions on our human tendency to dichotomize or categorize the world around us. He refers to this affinity as the ""tyranny of the discontinuous mind,"" and provides intriguing biological explanations for this behavior. In my humble opinion, I think any individual who wants to truly grasp a global view of human behavior, should do some readings in Evolutionary Biology, and The Ancestor's Tale is a superior choice."
3,As long as geologic history itself...,"The road to Canterbury is very long, especially when it takes four billion years. It would be appropriate to say basing this work on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is a novel idea, if the work were a novel, but it is not. At a quarter of a million words, Ancestor's Tale is large enough for two or three standard novels. Despite its overall conversational tone, it is a dull read. As I trudged my way through it I heard the kids yelling, are we there yet?Ancestor's Tale is a work more for knowledgeable lay readers than scientists. While the subject matter is interesting, the delivery is not. I put the blame for this squarely in the hands of Mr. Dawkins' editor. Ancestor's Tale if tightened by one third or one half and rewritten more as a true pilgrimage story than a literary conceit, would work far better and be read by more people.I can only recommend this book to those who already know Mr. Dawkins work and wish to keep up with him."
5,Excellent and readable by all,"This is a fine book that lays out the history of life on earth with the grace, beauty, reality, and interest that few can bring to such a task. I received this a while back for Christmas and read it in the next few days. My only regret was that I got to the end.This book is written in a manner available to all readers, technical or not. The only book that I devoured as quickly and as intensely as this was Jon Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"" (also excellent) although on completely different topic.Get this book and enjoy Dawkin's mastery."
1,Pilgrimage to Dawn of Imaginative Fictitious Speculation,"As a zoologist, when he sticks with observable fauna phenomena, the book is quite interesting. But when he regresses back into the misty primordial fog of unobservable prehistory, the zoologist morphs into prognosticator and origineticist and the attempt doesn't come across well. The Argument from Personal Credulity fails in an age of scientific enlightenment. This book had been better off 1/3 the size and 1/2 the price. (...) For recommended rebuttal of atheistic rationalism try Dr. J. Sarfati's 'Refuting Evolution', but only if you're open to ALL the data beyond one zoologist's take on origins events."
3,The family tree of life on earth,"The book deals phylogenetic family trees for species, now, alive bytracing back characteristics of species to where they differentiated from others.In some cases we don't know why one species survives and others die out,but he discusses what we do know and understand.The resulting book is good for biology students."
2,Good biology bad politics,Dawkins excellent biological and linealogical discussions were tarred by numberous political remarks which are completely out of place.
4,Another great but flawed work from the king of bio-writers,"Richard Dawkins is one of the best science writers out there. He has once again produced a work that is in-depth, informative and fun to read. For the layman with an interest in the evolutionary side of biology, this is the author with which to start. Unfortunately, Dawkins clutters his work with juvenile, left-wing political commentary (thankfully they are brief), and this book is no exception. If you can ignore the occassional Bush-hating nonsense, the rest of the book is great. A remarkable ""journey"" back through the evolution of life - from modern man to primordial life-like self-replication billions of years ago. Thrilling and thought-provoking."
4,Almost 5 stars,"I'm less than half way through this book, and so far, I've thoroughly enjoyed every chapter.However, in a few places he veered away from science and into politics, which I felt could be done without.Also, I feel the need to point out parts of the book are written/co-written by one of his student. And yet Dawkins is listed as the only author."
2,Irreducible complexity?,"This work may be a fine and lucid account of biological history from a evolutionary standpoint, but it fails to address many of the gaping fallacies behind modern secular theory; the principle shortcoming being irreducible complexity.Many of nature's wonders - such as the motor-driven tails of the bacterium Helicobacter - simply cannot be accounted for by the incremental genetic framework proposed by evolutionists such as Dawkins. Like a George Foreman GRP4P Next Grilleration 4-Burger Grill, if you remove the functionality of a single component (such as the grease tray) then the organism (grill) will fail to operate, and hot burger fat goes literally everywhere. Thus, how can complex organisms, whose existence relies on the functionality of many thousands of different biological mechanisms (such as legs), come into being through minor genetic mutations? The answer: they can't! Only a divine creator (a.k.a. God) can have been responsible."
2,Passes Personal Credulity Test for the Impressionable,"The Ancestor's Tale makes for exceedingly longwinded reading, but has many bright spots. Earns 2* as it touches on platypus aquatronics system, beaver dambuilding and other wonders of a nature that rational minding senses logically had to be programmed into nature by Beyond-natureness.In equation form, this Tale passes the Personal Credulity Test:E=mc2E is Evolution, m is materialistic mindset, c is credulity constant which must be squared for evolution to equate.For a different Ancestral Lineage concept, try Philip Johnson's 'Darwin on Trial' and compare it to a book by Mr. Wells titled Icons of Evolution."
4,Excellent but wrong,"Dawkins presents an excellent and informative account of evolution in this skillfully crafted and well-written tome. However, as some recent reviewers have noted, Dawkins is operating within benighted scientific orthodoxy and is therefore completely wrong. A simple syllogism proves that existence must have been Created:Things that exist must have been createdExistence existsTherefore existence must have been createdAnother problem with evolution is the well documented 'dinosaur problem'. If the world was based on survival of the fittest, humans (and most other animals still around today) would have been killed off by the dinosaurs several hundred years ago.So in conclusion: an excellent book despite its wrongness."
2,Dawkins is no Stephen Jay Gould,"Dawkins spends a lot of time talking about how the book is organized, as if he's writing his thoughts down as they come to him. And this is especially annoying since the ""Canterbury Tales"" analogy simply doesn't work. Also, he spends a great deal of time on nomenclature instead of more interesting scientific facts, and alludes to things he's not telling us because they're in his other books, assuming we've read everything he's ever written. This is not the grand overview of evolution it appears to be. In fact, I'm not sure why it was written."
4,Great Slant on Evolution,"While evolution in general has always made a lot of sense to me, the authors approach using ancestors both identified areas of confusion and presented clarification. Points of confusion are where creationist target evolution. So not only did the author present clarification, he also provided arguments against creationism. An example --- eyes. Creationist love to say that the eyes are so complex that they coundn't have developed on their own. Answer, not only do eyes evolve once, but they've evolved independently about nine times -- camera, pinhole, fish eye, compund like a fly, and more in various animals. It just seems that vision is a good thing to have when there's light, and so they evolve. And where there's no light eyes may even un-evolve -- examples of cave dwelling animals. For me the ancestor angle explained the absence of the missing link that's always argued."
5,A Stroll Down Genetic Memory Lane,"This was a very enjoyable book. Dawkins walks the reader backwards in time, introducing us to common ancestors with modern species. This is the opposite direction of most books, which tend to start with single celled organisms and then ""advance"" to human beings.Dawkins writes well. This volume had very little polemics and a great deal of openness. At times Dawkins was quite willing to say ""we don't know."" Perhaps the one point he hammered home the most, especially with the direction of story flow, was that humans are not the inevitable nor crowning jewel of evolution."
2,Cranes- Population Four,"Although this album is the Cranes, it sucks. This is the only album of thier's I wish not to have. Acoustic guitars over a 4/4 rock beat? Hullo? Where is the marked Cranes seal of creativity and beauty? Alison's voice does not work in rock. Stick to artsy-goth-swirly-ambience, like the rendition of Jean-Paul Sartre's Electra and the Flies... phenomenal. The Cranes NEED strings... rock is definately not their thing."
5,charming,"Like many long-time Cranes fans, I came away from this album feeling perplexed and let-down. It seemed to mark a clear departure from their previous musical direction (if the evolution from Forever to Loved can be considered a direction), and one that I wasn't too pleased with.However, I found ""Angel Bell"" running through my head, and popped the CD back in a few days later. It took a little tenacity on my part, but after a few more listens, I decided that it was a wonderful CD. Charming in a way that only Cranes can charm. If you're new to Cranes, though, this isn't your starting point; Wings of Joy is the ticket.I'm disappointed to see that the label is out of stock; snap up a copy while they're still floating around in the used bins."
2,A disappointing sellout,"I consider myself to be a strong fan of the Cranes--well, I considered myself to be, I suppose. You can't imagine my disappointment, then, when I bought the extra-$pendy version of Population Four, only to suffer the trite and uncreative instrumentation of the top-40 indie scene. The first indicator of this slide is the uncecessary and repetetive use of our four-letter favorite in the very first track. It seems to go downhill from there. The only exception to the nonstop drivel that seeps from this putrescent album is Stalk, which surprisngly was the only song Alison did NOT sing or write. Perhaps Alison was simply going through a rough time when she wrote the other eleven songs, but I sense she had a larger hand in the songwriting this time, and it shows. This album had none of the mysticism of Loved, none of the dreaminess of Golden, and none of the melancholia of Wings of Joy. It was a sellout. It reeked of money and conformity."
1,Dreadful vocals!,"While previewing the samples on all these albums, I kept waiting for the voice to change a little. Instead, the monotonous vocals make every song of theirs too much alike. Other singers are much more diverse. The singing is dreadfully boring, but the music is all right."
3,I know no more about the Cranes . . .,". . . than what's printed on the liner notes, which is precious little. I have an MP3 directory full of their stuff from Wings of Joy, Forever, Loved and this, and the whole set makes great background music for certain times of the day. I can't hear what she's singing most of the time anyway, but like Lush, it doesn't matter, it's the sound that's cool. With that said, my directory has five songs from this CD that fit pretty seamlessly into the mix. Is that worth the price of the CD? Yeah, probably."
4,"Definately not their best, but still worth the buy.","While this album is extremely different from the Cranes normal songs I still enjoyed it. Alison's voice is what has always attracted me to the group and her voice sounds just as beautiful over rock music as it does over their usual goth style. I do wish that the cranes return to their earlier form however, with albums like forever and wings of joy."
3,AWSOME,"This CD gets 3 stars only because of Pearl Jam's ""Last Kiss"". The song was good before and they made it even better."
4,A good collection of music,"okay, well, It doesn't have much to do with kosovo, but this disc full of grunge, love songs, hip hop, and ballads (it's quite a combination) is in one word: enjoyable. For any Pearl Jam lover, the unreleased songs are sure to excite. ""Last Kiss"" is wonderful. Most of the CD is fun to listen to. The KoRn remix is wild and interesting, the Tori Amos song is very pretty, the Psycho Man song is... well, cool!! I've heard better from Peter Gabriel, and the RATM song seemed to be sorta thrown in. Overall this is a great mix to listen to when you're not picky about what type of music you want to hear. Oh, and Ben Folds Five (my idols) have a different, yet intriguing new song. Why not give it a try? And hey, it's to a good cause."
5,a must-have,"from the opening beat of ""last kiss"" to the final strings of ""soldier of love"", this album rocks. For everyone who has a wide variety of taste in music, this is the one- it's got it all, live, remixed, and full of power. so, so good"
1,Didn't show.,"On the third week of waiting for the CD, it didn't show. That day, I got an email stating my address was incorrect. Amazing, since this is the only item that I purchased through Amazon that wasn't able to find the address. I double checked my address, and it is accurate. But, I decided not to re-order because I don't feel like waiting another three weeks for them to turn around and tell me my address is mysteriously wrong again."
3,"Good mix, good bands, good cause.","This was probably bought by more ""Pearl Jam"" fans than anyone. Two songs from those guys are on here, both good. Besides those, the tracks I like most are from ""Rage Against The Machine"", ""Bush"", ""Peter Gabriel"", and a great live ""Neil Young"" song. But most of them are good. If you enjoy the majority of these bands, then this is well worth it, especially used. If there's a ""PJ"" fan in the world who still wants this cd for ""Last Kiss"", it's also on their ""Lost Dogs"" collection."
3,An Ok cd if you like that kind of stuff,"I bought this cd for ""Last Kiss"" which I'm sure a lot of people did. It was worth the money. Especially that ""Solider of Love"". WOW! I also enjoyed the remix of ""Freak On A Leash"" by KoRn. I liked that song and I didn't really want to buy the whole KoRn cd.This is just my opinion. If you don't necessarily like this kind of music then you better look before you leap (listen before you buy). I thought it was an awesome cd."
5,This is real classic,One family faced the ship-wrecked situation. They all help each other to fight for their survival. This is the real story that will stop you from doing anything else but reading it.
5,Timely thoughts from a real economist,Free thinking economists such as Mr Chossudovsky are few and far between. Please take the time to read about the reality of what we have been lured into.
5,Callanetics Works,I loved callanetics because it is so simple and easy. Anybody can do it and it works! You become firmer and feel better in just a few weeks.
3,a little boring - but shows a difference in legs!,"i got this video from my grandmother's house and thought i'd give it a try on one of those familiar ""fat days"". the music was tacky and so were the movements- but i could feel a difference the next days and following weeks. worth a try!"
5,A sailor's book...,"Even though the book is not new, it is a wonderful read for both armchair and active sailors who love the Maine coast. The photographs are spectacular and the text is, too."
5,"Bad Blood, Good book","At this point when we are looking to a new century, isn't it time to dispense with illusions? This book asks us to set aside our need to glorify an institution, to really evaluate it in terms of its actions, and to make our own judgement call.Based on the facts not on the myths. It is a courageous thing to ask us to do."
2,Lots of accusations; where are the facts,"The author concludes that because Red Cross makes a LOT of money on blood and because a terrible thing - AIDS- happened to patients, then the Red Cross must have profited from these terrible things. Well, that may be true (and there are Red Cross employees who did jail time in Canada, France, Japan, etc. to suggest there is something to that) but there are no facts here to support the connection. There has been no investigative journalism done here. This approach will appeal to conspiracy theorists, but for a well-researched history that comes alive, and for supported facts, you'd be much better off with BLOOD: an epic history by Douglas Starr, ISBN 0688176496"
5,Poor 'tabloid' journalism,"This book is an example of poor jounalism that creates a satire of life. This book only critises the American Red Cross, with poor reinforcement with data. It almost seems that the author just critises this organization for the heck of it. It conveys a terrible message to the public, scaring them no to ""Give blood"". To my knowledge, other blood banks too, have the same problem with testing, etc. at the time, but the American Red Cross, in this case, is targeted because it is the largest blood bank in the US. Is it right to direct all this attention when the author should have done a ""big picture"" approach rather than using the American Red Cross as a focal point?"
1,Please no backlash against the Red Cross,"Please please please PLEASE *don't* let this book make you think donating blood to the Red Cross is a bad idea. For one thing, the blood screening process has changed dramatically since the events detailed in the book. For another thing, every blood donation place--whether the Red Cross or a local hospital--must now follow strictly enforced FDA guidelines.PLEASE don't think you're doing a noble thing by not donating your blood. Someone needs it badly."
3,overlooked,"The author of this book states her opion of the red cross and seems to find the people of wich were infected by hiv and aids and tell their stories but, did she forget the hundred of thousands this instituition helps every day with the blood porducts they collect. I wonder if she her self has ever donated blood.Lets not forget that the red cross is monitored very closly by both the CDC and the FDA. I encorage people to rent the movie ""And the band played on"" it explains alot about the aids epademic. and remember when you point a finger at someone(the red cross) you have 4 pointing back at youself."
1,To tell the truth,"There may be some truth in the statements contained in the book, at a time when HIV/AIDS was becoming a well known disease more than just the Red Cross was testing and supplying blood to hospitals, there are many blood banks that do the same thing as the Red Cross but they do it for a profit. However, it sells books to just state the Red Cross was the only one responsible for HIV/AIDS. The Red Cross does not make money on their blood supply. They charge hospitals for processing fees only to recoup the cost of the manufacturing, testing, processing, etc. of the blood it collects. It is the hospitals that are permited to collect the money, charge patients and insurances. Before criticizing the Red Cross, do some research yourself. FDA standards are met and exceeded for blood testing by the ARC."
3,Well done Character trace,"As you watch you will be drawn in to the lives of a few people and find yourself hoping they complete their goals. I did not find the presentation balanced at all though. It focuses on the hardships and struggles, but not the legality, morality or social impact on the effect of illegal immigration. It is worth watching though as it shows you a portion of this journey you are likely not aware of."
5,Excellent documentary,"This is a very sobering look at the reality of crossing the border into the U.S. I got very invested in the kids' journeys. Wish I knew where they were now.One warning for those who want to watch this with younger people: there are a few curse words and the content is mature, but the issue is so important I believe it's worth watching. (You can fast-forward through the two scenes with curse words if you know where they're at.)"
2,Warning: doesn't work with Mac or Vista,I don't know if this scanner is good or not. I bought a Mac Mini for it - no driver. Then bought a Dell with Vista - no driver! Very disPpointing.
2,"No Visat, Window7, and Mac Support","As other reviewers have pointed out, the machine does not have appropriate driver to support Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Mac OSX.I paid $2000+ for the machine. For a machine at that price range, you would expect the manufacturer to stand behind their product.Canon does a good job in supporting their cameras. Not for their scanners unfortunately."
4,"Very English,What!","This is the second 'three book' volumn written by Galsworthy about the Frosyte family. He lived in the years, late 1800s to 1930, and wrote about morals and habits common to the time and place. By the time you get to this vol. you are very well aquainted with the family, their virtues and faults. If you are not English, which I am not, you may find, as I did, that there are many words, slang and otherwise, that are a bit confusing. But it was enjoyable to be exposed to this difference in language. (We don't really speak English here in America. We speak American!) But people are people wherever they may live and life experiences much the same. A very enjoyable record of a large and loyal family finding their way after the Big War, dealing with the scary changes in traditions and thought. I fully recommend it to lovers of sagas."
2,Its a struggle,"This review is based on a CD set provided by the Amazon Vine program.Listening to this has been a serious struggle. First off, I've found I just don't like books on tape. I thought it would be good for my commute, but my car CD player jumps back to the beginning of the track when you start it.I like Patricia Briggs. I've enjoyed the Mercy Thomson and the Alpha and Omega series. I find them to be light and fun.As I said above, I struggled with Masques. This is obviously a first work. The writing is choppy, and even with a rewrite, this shows through. I also found the voice of the narrator to be annoying, and unimaginative.All in all, I'd give this a pass."
1,Um...?,"I grudgingly listened to four of the eight CD's in this book set and found not one thing I liked about it. Each time I put in the next CD I thought, well maybe something will start to click for me, but it never did. I was not familiar with this author whatsoever. I see that it looks like I am in the minority of negative reviews for this novel. I just could not understand anything in this book. I can't even tell you what it was about other than some girl who can turn into a mouse and a guy who spends most of his time as a wolf and the narrators annoying, nasal-like voice that sounds overly affected. I am a bit baffled that I really could not make any sense of the story at all, it just sounded like noise in the background and nothing grabbed my attention. Oh well, I certainly did not miss hearing the name E'Magi repeated anymore."
5,Another great novel by Patricia Briggs,"I never read the original version of Masques, but I love Patricia Briggs. When this version came out it was a must have. I got the audio version which is perfect for my commute. The story is gripping, I stayed in the parking lot just to hear a bit more. It is a great romance. I am excited for the second book. If you like paranormal romance then Patricia Briggs is the top of class. If you love Patricia Briggs then this novel won't disappoint."
4,Quick moving fantasy novel,"This was the first book I read by Patricia Briggs and after reading her introduction, I was prepared to find the writing flawed. But the book turned out to be quite a page turner with an action packed story where your mind rarely wanders. And it was sweet :)"
3,Guess CD Books are not for me,"I got this a long time ago and have just now finished listening to it, so I guess listening to books is not my cup of tea. Nor did I really care for the genre. So why did I get it? I wanted to try to expand the scope of my reading material. For me, I had a tough time hanging in there listening to the story. The quality of the item provided through the Vine Program was very good--but this is only the third or fourth CD book I have listened to.If you are interested in this item, I would pay attention to the most ""helpful"" and the least ""helpful"" reviews rather than mine since I am basically neutral about CD books and this genre."
5,Cool must read!,"I really enjoyed the funny parts of the story, I also enjoy the sorcery involved. I just can't resist a good story with magic elements. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
4,"Early Briggs, but not bad at all.","MASQUES is an update/rewrite of Briggs' first published novel; this version is an unabridged audio CD. Caveat Emptor: I don't generally listen to audio books as they have, in the past, uniformly put me to sleep. This book did not. Katherine Kellgren was never boring to listen to, handled the various voices of a wide variety of characters in a manner that was not confusing to the listener. The story is fairly typical - bad magician taking over his world, good magicians fighting him, a romance that is obvious but not insipid. Fans of Briggs' more recent works will probably enjoy this. Fans of the genre ditto. I listened to it in small chunks of time (usually around 20 minutes or so) with a few longer trips of 45 minutes to an hour. I never lost track of where I was in the story. This has almost converted me to audio books, which was a pleasant surprise."
4,Just as good,"I read the section at the front of Masques where Patricia explains how she wrote the book and gives us background on it. I just wanted to say that I enjoyed Masques just as much as I did all of the Mercy Thompson books, so no need to apologize for anything, Patricia. It's good. You're good."
3,"Not Patricia Briggs Best, But Worth the Read","Masques was the first book Patricia Briggs published, and it went out of print a long time ago. This reissue was reworked and released to support a sequel she wrote. The story has been updated to fix some of the issues found in the original version, but overall the author seems to have only added descriptives and some minor cosmetic changes. Overall, the story is about the same.Masques isn't Patricia Briggs's best book by any stretch of the imagination. The story is full of cliches and is obviously an early work. However, it is a fun story and I would recommend it to friends.For me, the best part of the book was the introduction where the author talks about her publishing experiences and the reworking of Masques. I found it inspirational."
2,Overlooks Important Facts and Misrepresents Others,"Much of what Eliach has written is informative and valuable. Unfortunately, the events surrounding the 2nd World War are not correctly depicted by her. She would have the reader believe that her family was killed by Polish guerillas because they were Jewish. However, there were other Jews living in the same region which were not harmed at all. It can be demonstrated that her parents had supported the Soviet invaders against the local Poles, and that is the reason why the Polish guerillas eliminated most of her family. The death of children is an unfortunate fact of war: How many Polish children froze to death on their way to Siberia after being deported there?"
1,On the Same Genre as Holocaust-Denial Material,"How does a Jewish reader feel when reading that the Holocaust never happened? Well, the same way a Polish reader feels when reading this revisionist work. Unfortunately, the Holocaust deniers do not own a monopoly on falsification of history. This book is likewise departs substantially from historical reality. The reader is not informed that the author's parents were Communists, and that is the reason for their venomous hatred of Poles and Poland. Eliach's parents were killed by the Polish underground because they were Communists, not because they were Jews. I am also amused to hear her treat Soviet Communist sources as truthful representations of the views and policies Polish patriotic organizations..."
5,Incredible adventure story,"What an exciting and amazing story this is! Against all odds these very strong and tenacious adventurers have skied across a nearly impassable collection of mobile ocean ice to the North Pole and back under conditions of extreme cold - as cold as -72 degrees! All supplies for 4 months for this completely self-sufficient expedition were carried in backpacks and dragged along in sleds. Their pre-trip planning was so complete they knew in advance when every morsel of food would be consumed! That totaled enough for a daily calorie allotment was 7000 calories. To eat less would incur a dangerous loss of strength.The book is well written and very exciting. It kept me riveted to my seat until I finished reading it. When I was done, I felt as if I had been part of the adventure - except I was still warm and comfortable, with no aching muscles!"
4,"Good pictures and information, but for the younger ages.","Large print, full page color pictures, this book is for younger children with a beginning interest in astronomy, particularly the voyagers. But, if you have a large knowlege of astronomy, particularly the outer planets, you don't need this book to suppliment your collection."
3,Arena,"Well time has not been gentle to this classic, plus Bethseda Softworks released this game as freeware and can be downloaded on their website. Allthough the version they released is not the full version and alot of the cinematic scenes were taken out. I suggest you download the free version before you purchase this ""enhanced"" version, and decide if it's for you."
1,It never showed up...,"I never received this product. After waiting the requisite amount of time, I sent an email and was told to contact Amazon. I did. Amazon refunded my money and a couple weeks later I was blessed with a very rude email from the seller. Great.If you want a Moleskine, I suggest you shop elsewhere. These are good notebooks, but not worth the hassle."
3,Pages are too thin,"The pages are way too thin. Don't even think about using a rollerball or gel ink pen. Even a ballpoint shows through! It's a good format, but the pages are just too thin."
5,Happy baby happy mother!,My son is 13 months old and I am using this product since he was born and never had a problem with the diaper rash. It is a very good skin protector!
2,Statistics Book - Not Really,"For a statistics course, this textbook lacks a clear and concise format. Would not recommend it if you want to learn statistics."
1,Not great quality or sound,Got Nandy one for ~20$ or so and works 10times better. This one cant be used with a mixer + home audio system. Unless using with PC which i have not tried.
4,Great Value,We ordered the microphone as a extra for a Karaoke machine. It works better than the one that came with the machine! At $11 is was a super value.
2,Not STEREO,"This mic was bought because the title says stereo mic. As 1 reviewer said before me it is not a stereo mic, it is in fact a mono mic. I have added a customer pic at the top to prove."
1,NOT a STEREO microphone,"I have not used the mic yet, but I will be returning it. It is NOT a STEREO mic as advertised. It is simply a mono mic that can be used to record stereo IF you use TWO mics. Duh."
3,not for the casual reader,"Bernard Lewis catches a lot of fire from people claiming he has no idea the subject he's writing about. I've only read a few articles by him and while I can pick out some flaws, this book doesn't seem to deserve the scorn it has received. Maybe I'll change my mind after I've read more of his work, but this one in particular didn't seem so bad.In this book Lewis has seperate chapters devoted to the various forms of identification. The chapters include subjects such as religion, state, nation, language, etc. I think Lewis did a fine job of identifying the different forms of identification. The chapters are short and relatively to the point, but I still found them to be somewhat dry. I feel that this is more of a historical book rather than analytical, but I've read other history based books about the region that were more accessible than this one."
3,Expiration Date,"Great product and great price. I was skeptical at the amazing price I was almost tempted to buy a few boxes but good thing I hesitated. Buyers beware, there is a reason why they are on sale (I'm talking about the Strawberries and Creme) Expiration date is June 28, so unless you think you can drink a lot of these you should probably not order as much. You might not necessarily get the same expiration date as the ones I got, but probably something close to that. I only ordered one pack of 24, and I am happy with my order. I love muscle milk since its lactose free and very tasty. I am not trying to stop anyone from buying, just warning you to the expiration date since the seller failed to advertise it."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible tasting","I read so many reviews on this product.Trying to get a feel for the taste reviewed by others. I tried strawberries and creme and chocolate. First, let me say, I read someone review about how they had one of these, then went to the store, and threw up in a isle. I had a very similar experience. Very nasty tasting. I simply do not understand how anyone can say these taste good. I would seriously make sure you are reading actual reviews. Check peoples shopping history for more than a few items. I believe they are fake and lying. This crap was nasty. I would never, ever, ever, ever, recommend this product. They taste horrible."
4,Muscle Milk,"Overall I'm pleased with this product. It tastes reasonably well and seems to supply me with protein and nutrients it claims to contain. It serves my purposes well, and I use it for a late afternoon snack as I'm out and about between lunch time and the time I get home. If I was being picky, I could complain a bit about the carton packaging but if I'm paying a bit less because it helps keep the cost down then I'm ok with that too. This isn't the best shake out there, but it's a good value and a solid product."
4,muscle milk- strawberry creme,"tastes ok... chocolate tastes way better to me..Anyhow, got my shipment in less than 2 weeks, im happy..."
3,Good but not great,"Muscle Milk Vanilla is slightly less sweet than some protein drinks (including other flavors of Muscle Milk), which I prefer. And the individual containers are a good size. The ones often sold at gyms are larger--too large for a single serving (at least for a small woman) and not big enough for two servings. The biggest problem I have with Muscle Milk in general is that they get clumpy at the bottom. It's important to give these a good shake before drinking, but you still may have some clumps left."
5,Muscle milk is the bomb,"This flavor won't be for everyone, but if not the other flavors will do. Muscle Milk is an essential part of any muscle gain regimen."
1,This one is all wrong!!,Powdered muscle milk is great. Muscle milk in a 17 ounce carton is nice and smooth. This formula is so lumpy and chalky that I had to strain it to drink it. I have a case and a half left and can no longer tolerated the gel like lumps and awkward taste. This one is all wrong
1,Yikes!,"I have been using the powdered Muscle Milk Lite for over a year and I love it. My favorite flavor is the banana - I think it is absolutely delicious, even when just mixed with milk. So, when I saw this 'ready to drink' banana Muscle Milk product, I thought I would love it. However, that is not at all the case! These drinks have a very strange after taste and I can't quite figure out what it is. They don't taste at all like the powdered product mixed with milk. I have drunk two of them, and I'm not quite sure I can stomach the rest. I tried one on my husband and he swears I was trying to kill him. Thank goodness we have three sons...I'll try giving the drinks to them (who knows - sometimes it seems they will eat or drink anything)."
4,Train Hard,"If your looking to be fit, or stay fit Muscle Milk is for you. You could stop eating regular food and live off this stuff (I don't advise that). Just be careful about how much you drink and not work out. If your working out via the gym or running on a regular 4 to 5 times a week perfect, however if your sitting home drinking muscle milk and watching TV your going to gain weight serious weight, I'm talking where do they hose you down weight. Think."
3,There is No Music on this...,"Don't know what CD this other reviewer is talking about, but this is purely an INTERVIEW disc. Don't expect to sing unless it's to your own tune.As for an interview disc, it's decent but not necessary. If you own a few of these already, you'll realize that they're pretty much redudant after the first few tracks. As a piece of history, they're interesting but nothing more than that. They don't provide any major insights as The Beatles' answers to most questions are typical and trite. There are few interview discs out there that are actually good such as Lennon's interview the day he was assassinated. This particular interview disc however doesn't provide anything new to warrant a purchase.Overall, an average interview disc. Once again, there is NO MUSIC on this CD."
2,"Simplistic, shallow, waste of time","If you pick this book up in a store you will notice that there are no quotes on it from book reviewers or from the author's peers. Only now do I realize why. This book appears to have been churned out by an obiviously smart fellow who gives readers a 40,000 foot fly-by on twenty-one different topics. This book is appropriate for teenagers who are first encountering ideas such as ice ages and gravity. (""What are Black Holes Really Like"" is a chapter that is all of 8 pages.) If you already have a basic working knowledge for any of the topics in this book I recommend you choose more advanced and detailed books."
5,"Interesting, solid, and fun science","I enjoyed this enormously--it's interesting, solid, and fun science for the non-scientist. A valuable book well written."
5,5 stars,This stuff is the best! It tastes great and if gives you that full feeling after your done. You gain weight in all the right places (if you are working out enough).
2,Not so good...,"I dont see any difference in my weigh, tastes great but I still dont see any muscles and I workout hard."
3,"Good price, reasonable quality for the non-fussy","The first thing that strikes you about this speaker is the price!The WH-2 system (center plus dipole surrounds) is meant for someone who already has 2 good speakers for mains and just wants a basic upgrade for home theater.If you're not an audiophile or a major audio enthusiast, this speaker should do just fine. Dialog reproduction - its main job is reasonable. Though not not crystal clear (it is a sub [$$$] speaker, you know), is good enough for the non-fussy...However, if you're the type who listens critically, I would recommend you look at the Wharfedale Diamond 8 Center."
4,Great speaker for the money,"I did some research and I found out that Wharfedale has one of the best bang-for-the-buck quotients out there.For the money, you can not buy a better center channel speaker. Sure, it's not going to run with the top of the line models, but you can't expect it to. However, I have put it up against some significantly more expensive speakers and it blew them away.I don't regret this purchase."
3,Amazing how we each recover and let go in different ways!,This book was a brilliant insight to lesbians letting go. Weare unable to distant ourselves so many times from someone we onceshared ourselves with. We are the epitome of ending loves!
1,Beware Sony Desktops,"The Sony Desktops seem to work well right out of the box, but soon problems develop. First the printer port failed, then a DVD-RW drive went out. Replacements don't fit right so you have to permanently remove the face plate of the computer--now it looks like trash. Then the software fails or starts to have problems--I mean the Sony video software. Lots of rebooting and freezes. Drive you nuts nd you are constantly losing work. You can't upgrade, you have to buy a whole new computer, and there are no software fixes. Sony support really sucks, you'll never get any help. And dron't try to find hardware upgrades, you can't find parts to fit your specific model, and no one at Sony gives two hoots. So beware. You'll be buying another computer in a few short months!"
1,Failed Out of The Box,"Received a ""CPU Fan Abnormal"" error on the first restart. The fan is working but the CPU is running to hot at idle. I called Sony they are going to repair, not replace it. I purchased it from Circuit City and they are going to replace it, thank you for standing behind the products you sell! I have had trouble with other Sony products lately, so I think this will be the last Sony product I purchase!"
1,Awfully confusing,This book is so confusing that it will not even make a good reference book. The poorly written chapters with poor overall structure will make you want to return this book in a heartbeat. Only buy this book if a professor *requires* you to buy it.
1,Where's my book?,"It has been 29 days since I ordered my textbook, it has never arrived, and the seller will not respond to my e-mails...very poor service!"
3,A question of perspective,"This book draws on Dr Sack's personal experience of trauma and recovery. It is an interesting perspective for the doctor to view things from the standpoint of the patient, and it drives home the point that apart from professional competency, excellent interpersonal skills are vital. One must never forget that in dealing with a patient, you relate to him/her as a person first, and as a doctor second. This insight is conveyed clearly here, and as obvious as it might seem, it is often relegated as being of a lesser importance by most medical professionals.The experience recounted though is overtly detailed and can become rather heavy to digest and a challenge to get through at some parts of the book."
2,Sacks is at his best when he writes about others,"I slogged through this one twice, reading it once 6 years ago and again recently. It was my introduction to Sacks when I read it originally. I think that what annoyed me most is that Dr. Sacks here seems so self-absorbed and pretentious that it distracted from his story - which is pretty fascinating in the abstract. You know I love Goethe, Nietzsche, Proust et al. too, but it just seems sophomoric and self-indulgent to dredge them up at every opportunity.I've read his other books in the meantime, and this one still is my least favorite. I think that he's at his best in An Anthropologist on Mars, Awakenings or Island of the Colorblind, when he's writing (primarily) about others. If you're looking for a good starting point to read Dr. Sacks wonderful stuff - pass this one up. If you've read the rest and still need more, look elsewhere. In a perfect world this would have remained in Sacks' personal manuscripts and never seen the light of day."
2,Boring,"Oliver Sacks is better in theaters than read. I consider ""The man who mistook his wife with a hat"" the only readable book from him."
2,"Idea is good, product not so much.","My dog is big and likes to chew. He wouldn't take this at first. It has a weird odor to him. It's made in China, so it could possibly not be made of a typical farm animal or has a weird preservative coating...? The braid design is cool though."
2,Not so sure,there must be a smell or something as my dog hasn't touched it. He usually eats them up esp if I get them from the pet store. but this must have had a smell or something because he won't go near it.
3,Not great for an active chewer,Was hoping these braided chews would hold up a little longer then the traditional role. For my active pit mix we did not notice any difference. Would recommend the Chunk Chews braided products.
4,Nice Camera and Kit,"I recently purchased this camera and kit based on compatibility with my other Pentax lenses; its other features; and my experience with my old 35mm Pentax. I had purchased my first 35mm Pentax in 1974. Unfortunately that camera finally broke down in 2006! Anyway, time to get digital.The kit was shipped from Cameta Camera and arrived on the date promised (Ordered July 17th and arrived July 26th with standard UPS shipping). Unfortunately, when taking inventory, I noted no camera bag but a note on the invoice saying it was on backorder. That is fine but it would have been nice if Cameta Camera would have sent an email saying so and estimated shipping date - they did not. I sent them an email today and hopefully will get a reply in a few business days. Thus the four instead of five star rating."
3,The Red Book,"This is a wordless picture book. I had purchased this book with other wordless books but it was not what I expected. The book has intricate levels of viewing and I had to look at the book two or three times to really grasp the meaning. It would be difficult for the average child to write a story for. It would work well with gifted students and their creative thinking. I teach second graders and this is there least favorite of my wordless books. I have had several tell me, I don't get it. It might work well with older children."
4,taking a little time to think...,"this book is quite the thinking book, i had to flip through the pages a few times to actually understand it. i feel that this book is a very well thought out and it is a book that makes children think. i also like the fact that this book doesn't have any words, because of the fact there are no words it makes children use their imaginations to tell the story."
5,It is What You Make of It,"When I presented this little red book to five-year-old twins, I honestly wasn't sure what their reaction would be. I was pleased to discover they were as immediately enthralled with it as I was. They took it to the couch, looked through the pictures for a few minutes, and be to tell each other stories about the book. Even better, this book as inspired them to make their own wordless books, which they delight in sharing with anyone who shows an interest."
4,"""Baby it's cold outside...""","The Red Book is a seemingly simple story that, in the end, proves to be pretty thought-provoking. Parents, if you've dismissed this book as a ""kiddie"" book and not for your 4-8 year old, then reconsider.A small girl donning winter clothing sees a red book on the side of the sidewalk, while walking to school. So what does she do; she picks it up and takes it along to school. During class, all our protagonist can think about is the book. That's when she opens this red book, and finds a map, which shows an island, and then a boy, who sees another red book in the sand...The pictures are good enough, with bold colors and black outlining each object. Lehman has written a book that will surely jump-start her career.R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer"
5,The Perfect Picture Book,I really like The Red Book because it has no words and you can make up your own story. I think it should have won the Caldecott.
1,the red book,The red book was cunfusing. But it was not to good. The teacher just told us what it was about. I loved how it had no words.
2,It does what it has to do,"This particular product really doesn't taste very good. A person can choke it down, once in a while, but it is good enough for when you just can't be bothered to cook anything else, or when your only piece of cooking equipment is an unkosher microwave, and you need a kosher meal."
3,I CALL THIS FILM A DRAW,"This film is somewhat formulaic in that ittries to balance the good and the bad amongstour protagonist.Unfortunately our ""hero"" is a man of few words.He instead is allowed to let a shrug, or distantlook to take the place of dialogue. Personally,this does not do it for me.The side story with Christopher Walken is weakand does not add to the story in a significant way.Personally, I am considering offering this DVD tomy local library, though I'll probably give it onemore viewing for good luck."
1,One of the worse movies ever!,"The guy doesn't even talk!! and when he does say something you just want him to stfu because his voice sounds so annoying.Not to mention, the character Mickey plays is an asshoe... Nothing to cheer for."
1,Rurka-plujka,"Koszmar. Totalna strata czasu. Nawet Walken zagral tutaj do kitu. Slodkawo-mdlawa atmosfera lat 80-tych. Ani to boks ani dramat, ani nawet nie romans. Lepiej samemu boksera poudawac przed lustrem.Hotel Detective"
5,Sun,"A quote from Bob Dylan about Mickey Rourke in Homeboy, ""He could break your heart with a look. The movie traveled to the moon every time he came onto the screen. Nobody could hold a candle to him. He was just there, didn't have to say hello or goodbye.""An amazing performance by Mickey Rourke. I hope this is turned into a DVD."
5,One of my favorite guitar/bass effect pedals.,"This pedal is one of my favorites. It has a very strong fuzz effect, but it really shines when combined with other effects like phasers or flangers. I can get an effect with my bass, this pedal and a couple other pedals that really reminds me of a bulldozer. I modded my effect pedal to have external power as it does not normally come with external power. This pedal is also featured in ""How to Modify effects"" based of Indie Mod guitarist mods. This pedal also sounds great when combined with the Behringer VTM pedal, and the Behringer Hell Babe Optical Wah."
2,Wrongheaded Wrags,"The sound is admirably clear, the playing is crisp and articulated. Some of the fast playing is pretty eye-opening. But where'd Buechner get his notions of ragtime style? The slower rags are rubato-ed and luftpausen-ed to death, their line destroyed with herky-jerky. Quarter notes in the right hand are routinely syncopated, though not marked that way in the scores, or turned into triplets--a nice effect applied once or twice. But not always and throughout. And the fast rags? Is this a speed contest? All charm and most melodic effect is lost on the rush to completion. There's not a lot of Joseph Lamb to be had on disc, but this is an irksome misrepresentation of the composer. Sorry, but I have to say it: under Buechner's hands, this is Sacrificial Lamb."
1,Sludge Nation-'Blow Your Speakers With.....'(Dedicated),"I give it 1 1/2 stars.Are they kidding with this release?I'm almost sure this CD was such a 'stiff',the record store clerk had to use a crow bar to pry it off the dusty shelf to return it to the distributor when it didn't sell.I mean 'Blow Your...' is somewhat pop-ish and some might even say they sound like a David Bowie wanna-be.But that would be like a compliment to Sludge Nation.The guitar work here is even acceptable.Other than that,I never gave it a second spin.Believe this is the band's sole effort,so far anyway."
3,ok,"This book has a lot of examples, but it doesn't go into great detail for some of the rules. It is good if you need pracitce with Spanish, however if you aren't already at least a little bit familiar with most of the grammar rules, you might have problems understanding her explanations."
2,Full of Fluff,"I cant stand these cds. Like the gentleman's review before me, I agree that there are a few good songs on these cds. But these FEW good songs are not worth the trouble of sifting through all of the other ones. If you like melodic, spiritual, mystic techno with robotic sounds and video game sounds youve hit the gold mine. But if youre into more serious, digital, rockin, techcno music youll be extremely dissappointed."
5,Epic CD--a must for all trancers,"If you are a fan of European trance, this is the definitive CD. Take the who's who of the best DJ's that were active in all of the best clubs in Europe, analyze their strongest tracks that were caned like crazy, put it into one mix with two of the hottest DJ's in this genre, and you have this CD. I am not a fan of all of the gatecrasher compilations, but this one is right on the money!"
5,Best Gatecrasher CD made,I have all the gatecrasher cd's and this is the best one by far. Great trance and dance songs in all 3 cds. This is a must for all dj's out there.
