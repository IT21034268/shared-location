4,Easy to read and put to use..,"Okay, so we are all not great organizers, but this book gives you alittle insight on why and also the how to unclutter. I must confess I was a little surprised that VHS tapes were in it and not how to organize your electronics, but then I didn't look at when it was published.All in all I found VERY useful tips that I am using now and it is easy. Nothing happens overnight, so the book says. I find it to be correct in that. Also, it is such an easy read, you don't get ""cluttered"" up with hints- straight to the point!"
2,Clutter,I would not recommend this book for a client or an organizer to read. I say this because in my opinion the author writes the book with under tones of arrogance and does not explain to the reader that these are methods that may work for him but it is ok to try other ways to find what fits for a particular person. There are many ways to archive success in completing an organizing task and a person should be open-minded.
3,Cleaning out my closets,"None of the books I ordered to give me pointers didn't seem to tell me much I needed to know about that. My situation didn't fit these how to books as they went through a lot of stuff that didn't pretain to me very much and having boxes strewn all over to sort things can not work here for me as I have roomers and the hall would be blocked doing such a thing. I guess if I had a huge house like some have, but I am in a small 3 bedroom condo and it wasn't helpful for me.MomElly"
2,Oy Vey!,"No one has ever been a bigger Dusty Springfield fan than I. That said, this is one of the most amateurish, thrown together ""salute"" DVD's I've ever seen. If it weren't for the rare footage of Dusty's TV appearances, this little disc would have found its way into File 13 by now.It's ""hosted"" by 2 people who act as though they had nothing more than a nodding aquaintance with Ms. Springfield - Petula Clark and B. J. Thomas. It just begs the question ""why them?"".Save your money and buy the French & Saunders video which has most of the same clips plus Dusty HERSELF! Yep, she participates in this humourous banter with the gals who put together AbFab. It's much more enlightening to hear about Dusty's life and career from Dusty herself rather than a couple of aging contemporaries. It's a real treasure since it was one of Dusty's last public appearances.This DVD is just a fluff piece of cheaply produced drivel with some great old clips. Do yourself a favour - buy the French & Saunders video instead."
5,Dusty on DVD!,At long last a DVD of one of the all time great vocalist. The great thing about this DVD is that you get full clips and not just bits and pieces. There is also some great interview footage that gives you more of an inside to this musical icon. When Dusty Springfield sang a song she was always able to make it her own.
1,Not worth the hassle,"After receiving the item I installed it in my Explorer and gave it a test run while out Christmas shopping. The picture quality on the main unit was outstanding, however the other monitor had distortion and what looked to be signal problems. I returned the item and received another from Amazon, Kudos to Amazon for being so fast with the replacement. I installed the second item, and had the same problems. Needless to say we returned that one too and went with a different DVD player."
1,Not worth it,"We used this unit only a few times after putting it in the minivan. Besides not being able to read discs at times, the unit itself (not the battery) overheats after 30+ minutes of use and shuts down. The supplied headrest mounting bags cover the remote sensor so the remote control is useless while the unit is mounted in a vehicle."
1,Piece of Junk,"The unit has a great picture with great sound...when it works, which isn't often. We returned the first unit because it didn't work half the time, giving us a ""wrong disc"" message all the time. Customer suport? Forget it. We sent it back with a check for about $18.00 for return postage and paid about $7 to ship it back, so it cost $25, or about 13% of the purchase price to have it replaced under warrenty. The second unit arrived within a couple of weeks, which was impressive. The problem is that the second unit is just as bad as the first unit!! If you buy this unit, fork out the cash for an overpriced extended warrenty through your retailer (read the fine print) that will simply allow you to exchange it through the store in lieu of monkeying around with Coby. You will need the extended warrenty becasue the unit will fail."
4,"Good, but not terrific.","I like Katherine more in her old age. And I do like how you find out that Flip becomes a professional artist, but I wish it went more into that. I also wish in ""And Both Were Young"" it mentions Katherine just once or twice. But may be Katherine and Flip are too alike to go to the same bording school and it would change both of their life stories drastically.I love Katherine's relationship with Vicky's neice (Suzy and Josaih's daughter), Emily. Of course she is named after Emily Gregory, their great friend. When I first read this book I was surprised to learn Suzy and Dave marry. Drastically surprised"
3,"OK, but","not my favorite Anna Maxted, who is usually so laugh out loud funny. Seems a little less cohesive than her others."
2,"Boring, Long, Nothing Special","I really love chick lit, and found this to be one of the most boring, going nowhere stories I have read in a long time... I never enjoyed the story, it was too long with pointless details and I found it real easy to put down. Definitely would NOT recommend!!"
5,Very funny and a good story,"This is the first book I've read by Anna Maxted, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were parts that made me laugh so hard I was actually in pain! I wish this was available in an audio format too. I have since gone on to read two other books by this author, Getting Over It and A Tale of Two Sisters, and they are also good but not as funny. There is a definite theme in her writing of the main characters having to deal with unresolved problems in their family relationships from childhood."
2,My first Maxted book - not so impressed,"I was looking forward to a hard-to-put-down-engrossing-chick lit, but I thought the book was kind of disappointing...story and characters were shallow, superficial and plot took too many developments that weren't really credible - and I couldn't bond with the characters. It was written well enough, but it's just not particularly witty or funny. It felt kind of like watching an ok soap opera, as you're reading you're fairly hooked but in the end you don't miss out if you don't read it at all."
3,Not her best,"I have read all of Anna Maxted's books and this was probably my least favorite. It's still entertaining and an easy read, but compared to the others, not nearly as good."
3,Fake.,"This product contains no pheronome. It is merely a perfume named Pheromone. M. Miglin was rich enough to wipe out the start-up company that originally developed pheronomes so she could keep her perfume's name. Not nice. Karma does come around, does it not?"
2,Cheap of the cheap quality,Not happy at all with the quality of this cable. I would recommend Swell brand over this because at the least the Swell brand has your copper grade graded shielding + an aluminum jacket over the core foam insulator providing an added layer of shielding.
3,Enough Cable for your needs,This cable worked fine. The only problem is that the color of the cable was received as white and not black.
3,Nice,"I was expecting more of ""Island Life"", but it was indeed not. If you like less relaxing music, then this is for you!"
5,It's pretty much all been said....,"But I have to add, I have several books about ( in my never so humble opinion :) the greatest band of all time, but this one, I couldn't put down ( any of the several times I read it :)You will NOT be sorry."
2,Dense and Plodding,"It is a shame that author Ian Ousby died before completing ""The Road to Verdun."" If he had lived to see the project all the way through, he might have shaped it into something more readable. Certainly, Ousby was a diligent researcher and a very astute historian. Unfortunately, the book's plodding prose and strange configuration (for example, a 58 page prologue!) have mangaged to drain all but the most scholarly interest from the famous World War I ""battle"" in which there were more than 700,000 casualties. Great works of history, particularly military history, make the past come alive in such a way that expands interest in the subject matter well beyond the academic world. Ultimately, ""The Road to Verdun"" doesn't come close to doing that."
2,Road to Nowhere,Well just as the soldier's thought this was going to be an exciting war with lots of action and glory only to find it to be tedious and boring most of the time. This indeed was how I found this book. As both sides where bogged down in the trenches I became bogged down with endless trivlality and different points of historical contoversy.Never the less Mr. Ousby covered it very well for the scholor and those in need of knowing why WW1 came to be. His points on this are the best and the clearest I have read.
4,"A LOST ART, HA,HA,HA!","Growing up in Los Angeles. I remember going into music stores that had rows of Bootlegs. I did have Zeps (or not zeps) Blueberry Hill. Lots of Deep Purple & Alice Cooper. It was true! You could see a show,10 days later? Thar she blows! RECORD WORLD in LA PUENTE did have the best! You can tell the world was Bob Dylon for Clinton Heylin. Listening to the Beatles fart was about the leval of most Bootlegs. But thats what we wanted to get a wiff of,right?,lol! }:-D My step-brother Rick had at least 200 or more! But for me nothing like the real deal."
3,"great meterial, book condition was shabby.",Best book I have read on the subject.Book condition was a little ruff.
4,"Ah, the mid 90's...its all coming back. Plus one scolding.","I'm not going to add much more to the terrific reviews of the series - it is the best show you never watched, and since I managed to watch most of them (and caught up on the rest!), it is a terrific blast from the past.I am going to add one scolding, and its the reason I gave this DVD set 4 stars instead of 5. Unlike several other reviewers, I thought that the commentary track (""The Gas Man"") was rather thin. Yes, great, we got the writer and director of the show. But would it kill them to spend 47 minutes watching said show at least once before commenting on it? C'mon guys! You had a couple of interesting bits. Saying several times in essence ""wow, this is so great, wish I would have seen this before, lets watch...""...well, I can do that.Study for the test, dudes!"
1,No closed captions!,"Although the original show aired with captions, these DVDs have no captions. What's up with that? I can download caption files but that means I can only watch the shows on my computer, not my TV."
4,Homicide Life on the Street - season 3,"Good Dvd. Starts out slow and slowly picks up the pace. Very interesting how everyone works (and sometimes doesn't work) so well together. Glimpses into personal lives and how it affects them on the job. If you like police stories and detective work, you'll enjoy."
4,GREAT FOR KIDS,I GOT THIS FOR MY GRAND NIECE AND GRAND NEPHEW. I REMEMBER GUMBY AND POKEY WHEN I WAS LITTLE. I8 HAVE GOOD MEMORIES. I CONSIDER THEM AN EXCELLENT IMAGE AND ROLE MODEL-FUN TOO.
2,Only one I remember,"I bought this for my adult son who was totally into Gumby as a kid. There was only one episode we remembered. Definitely not an ""essential"" collection. Disappointed in the choices. Even the song is different. Check other reviewer lists to see if any appear familiar before buying."
5,Old Friends,I grew up with Gumby and Pokey. I have always loved them and it was good to see an evolution of their adventures.
2,Disappointing - not for a 3 year old boy,"I remember loving Gumby I wanted to introduce him to my 3 year old son. The novelty of the claymation held his attention, but these episodes have something ""scary"" in each of them. I think this turned him away."
2,april,"typical gumby episodes. if you like gumby, you will like this, it amused my daughter. it arrived packaged well in a timely fashion. i would buy from this seller again."
5,Took a chance,"I'm a college student in small-town Wisconsin. Late at night or early in the morning (about 3am) I stumbled on a web site that had an mp3 download for this guy. The song Hardwood Floors was enough to make me order it that night in hopes that the rest of the cd would also be good. ""good"" is an understatement. This is one of my favorite CDs now.My friends think one of the most romantic songs is 'Wonderful Tonight' by Eric Clapton--- 'Can't Explain This Feeling' by Jonathan Kingham is a lot better in both music and lyrics."
5,Text book,"The book came really fast, cheaper than the bookstore, and excellent quality. Great book!! and dealer!!"
3,Different than hardcover edition,"I bought this book as a gift. My daughter has owned the hardcover version for over 12 years now. I have a two year old and it is still a huge hit...kids LOVE this book! I was excited when I realized there was a board book version. My disappointment comes specifically with the board book version. The board book does not include Daisy, the little girl that is waking up for the day. It just goes right into the counting of animals. I actually ordered a stuffed owl to give along with the book because Daisy had one and tucked him in to sleep as she went on with her day at the end of the story. No Daisy...no mommy...no baby owl...huge bummer. The hardcover also ends with a double page of Daisy's room that shows all her stuffed animals. The numbers match the story her mom told. Hours of fun for toddlers and young children once they make that connection. These pages are not included in the board book version. Again...huge bummer."
5,Oscar Pettiford,"extraordinary bassist. Outstanding jazz player. Went to Essen Jazz Festival, Germany where people appreciate jazz. Never returned. Plays extraordinary solos."
4,Great value for the money,"Very good value for the $$$. Bought mine @ Frys for $49.95 (3-21-2009). Had it installed by Frys (39.95). Love the fact I can plug in the IPOD Touch and control the music list. It does take a bit to get it to find your music (would NOT recommend you do this while driving -- create a play list before plugging in the IPOD). One draw back is it does NOT charge your IPOD when plugged in. Thus not a 5. Pretty easy to work, nice layout -- preset eq and LOUD button are awesome! Put this in my 01 Neon and it rocks! Frys also has one with HD radio for $99.99 but since I have xm (will use FM to utilize that), I didn't want to spend the extra $$$.for 5.99, they also provide a 3 year 1 time replacement (take it back to frys and they will give you a new unit or replace with like model). Not too bad..."
4,Wow,"On the one hand, if it's true, what he says here should be required reading before anyone is allowed to vote or hold national office.On the other hand, I haven't yet been able to tell how true it might be. The ""proof"" he offers is thinner than most critical readers would like. But we (should) all know that just because you can't prove something doesn't mean it's not true.I can't help but feel I'd like to meet the man, but I don't even know if he's still alive (the book's been out of print for decades).P.S.: If an amateurish writing style is a huge turn-off for you, read something else. (But most people don't read a book like this for entertainment, so it's really not a problem; it's not like he's illiterate, just not much of a writer.)"
1,"Valdez, Alaska","The book contains many undocumented statements and a few half truths. I have been in the oil construction / engineering field in Alaska for over 30 years. I have also done extensive research on Hubbert's ""Peak Oil"" theory, which is not a theory anymore. In 1948 Hubbert began proving his theory beyond doubt by refining his data in time blocks to gain the maximum accuracy it contains today. Hubbert's theory acounts for the unfound oil and it is proving more true as time passes. It is a shame to see an individual, like Williams, supposedly representing God, to use a dead man,a mystery man and our nation's ignorance on anything outside American Idol, in an attempt to get into his neighbor's pockets."
1,Yes! Plenty Of Oil!!,"But it's all snake oil. This guy is so full of it, his eyes are brown. I hear him on the radio from time to time. Same story. Exactly the same. It's like replaying a tape, and no one has a name, no documents are provided, everyone addresses him as ""Chaplain,"" and seems to have no problem divulging every detail of the evil plan of The Elite (who control everything). Elite members even call him at home to spill their guts. The book costs $2000 because it is worth it. Each copy has enough snake oil in it to power the United States for over two hundred years! This was told to me by one of The Elite, who called me at home just to tell me stuff like that. Lindsay Williams makes Bill Cooper look like Edward R. Murrow."
3,Gasprom and Wrangell Island,"For the non believers look into the giveaway of Wrangel Island (and Herald, Bennett, Jeannette, and Henrietta in the Arctic Ocean, and Copper Island, Sea Lion Rock, and Sea Otter Rock at the western end ofthe Aleutian chain in the Bering Sea).Why would the U.S. government give away the islands and resources quietly? To it's adversary!Not the greatest book ever what with the palms and bullfrogs being pulled up, but perhaps another witness to the wool pulled over our apathetic eyes."
5,bohemian gaing ball,"the quality is excelllent,the ball was made out of heavy glass which make it durble.i would tell anybody that was looking for one to look in amazon that there quality of there are tops"
1,Does this thing really cut wood?,"Cuts stripwood up to 1/2"" -- thus saith the vendor. Hmmmm, not on this planet. I can't even cut the super thin wood from the tiny crates Clementine tangerines are packaged in. Oh, wait, I can -- if I cut the wood on one side and then flip the wood over and continue the cut on the opposite side.I've tested this device on the following wood:- red oak- Aspen pine- white pineThe results? Just a ""bite"" impression from the device.I'm going to try this out on bone (human, animal -- I haven't decided) next. I'll update this review with the results; but for wood, meh, not so much."
5,very fast service,I bought a sweatshirt for a Christmas present. It came within a week. I was very impressed and would definitely order from them again.
5,A different kind of trumpet playing,"I'm an old trumpet player. In two ways. I'm old, and I haven't played my horn much in years. I've purchased and listened to many trumpet CDs, and I've always liked the flashy, high-flying style. This album is something quite different. The technical demands on the soloist in these string transcriptions are daunting. Young Mr. Nakariakov clearly has no problems in this area. What impressed me, however, was the sheer musicality of his playing. His sound in the lower register is fat and singing, and he plays the lowest notes on the trumpet (f#, g) with as much conviction as the rest of the range. Trust me, folks, this ain't easy. I almost forgot that I was listening to a brass instrument, because his lines and phrasing are so long and effortless. The boy doesn't seem to breathe! A friend of mine who isn't a musician simply refused to believe that he was listening to a trumpet.Highly recommended."
5,An essential addition to any trumpeter's library!,"I admit apprehension when listening to such a young artist for the first time, but the performance and level of musical maturity displayed by Nakariakov in this recording is astounding. The orchestra is supportive of the trumpeter, however sometimes weak in its own playing. I believe this to be a steeping stone for the trumpet into the 21st century in terms of the level of virtuosity that will become the standard for future generations."
3,"a ""silent alarm"" watch.","This is a beautiful watch except that you can't hear the alarm unless you press the watch to your ear. Nice date and illuminated hands features, but save some money and get the one without the ""silent alarm."""
1,"""Make Your Own Groceries "" and "" More Make Your Own Groceries""","""Make Your Own Groceries "" and "" More Make Your Own Groceries "" were both written by Daphne Metaxas Hartwig Both share the same ISBN number. There is different information in each book , they are not the same. I have ordered four (4) of these books "" More Make Your Own Groceries and every book that was sent was the wrong one . They sent ""Make Your Own Groceries "" The picture listed on Amazon .com showed a picture of ' More Make Your Own Groceries "" . I am very upset about this, one time you can figure but 4 times is ridiculus.Amazon .com is advertising these books under the wrong title. BEWARE BEFORE YOU BUY."
4,Richly Orchestrated & Accessible,"""Mauldin's music is suffused with the colors, shadows, light and smells of the sacred places of northern New Mexico. The music is richly orchestrated, tonal and very accessible to anyone who enjoys a composer who actually tries to communicate with his audience."" --Records International"
5,A Woman's Journey Toward Self,"Karen Blixen says in this beautiful book, ""I will not let thee go unless thou bless me."" Her farm in Africa yielded both miracles and suffering. This book reveals Karen Blixen's Sunday self--gracious and self-deprecating, enlightened and insightful. She faces struggles we know: career challenges, marital conflicts, complicated loves, and unfulfilled desires. She is one of us. Linda Donelson, author of ""Out of Isak Dinesen: Karen Blixen's untold story"""
2,Disappointing,"Well, ended up buying this book partly because of the movie, but also after reading a biography of Karen Blixen. Unfortunately, both the bio and the movie made it seem like this book would be more interesting than it is. I've read thousands (literally) of books in my lifetime, and probably gave up on only 3 or 4, this being one of them, giving up on page 236. This book reminds me mostly of Victorian novels, which are hard to read, though I must say I've managed to finish all of the few that I've read. The bio below was a very interesting read, however.Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller"
5,A masterpiece,"Blixen's prose is sheer poetry - her use of language is nothing less than honey on the tongue; read it out loud and you can feel the joy, sorrow, bitterness and simple pleasures Blixen experienced during her years in Africa. This one is a keeper."
5,"""I will not leave thee...","...except thou bless me."" Karen Blixen's (aka, Isak Dinesen) command of the English language is incomparable. At times, while reading this book, I had to remind myself that I was reading prose and not poetry, though in this particular instance, the distinction matters not, for they are one in the same. If you're searching for a book that will communicate directly with your soul (and you're sick of Chicken Soup), then place this one at the top of your list. A true literary classic in every sense of the term and merits a preferential spot on everyone's library shelf."
5,Great product,"I love this product. Laxatives & stool softeners don't work on me...and this works better than any colon cleanser to keep you regular. I take 1 in morning and 1 at night. I would not recommend taking more, because it causes bloating and gas.The price was great too."
3,Not as good as some other brand names,This product does not give me the results I had expected compared to another brand name of Colon Clense. Not sure why as the ingredients looked the same. I would not recommend as I feel there are other products simular that will give better results for digestion issues.
3,Not bad if you are new to the game.,This book was ok at best. I had already downloaded several ebooks before I read this book. It actually to me looks to be alot of revised info. If this is the first book you've read on picking up women ore becoming an alpha male you will enjoy it. If you have read other books on this subject you should probably move on.
2,nothing new or original,"All this book is a compiation of other people material, and the author presents it as original, using other people pickup lines and rutines, better to go to the original source."
2,Some Unrealistic Opinions !,"The idea that women likes sex as much as men do at the best seems crazy to me. In my 30 years of dealing with women (I am 44 now) I learned one important thing: Women will do anything to avoid sex, if she has no some other personal interest to do it!Most of books about biology and female magazines will try to brainwash you into beliving that women also have sex drive similar to men's. Don't buy that!After 30 years in the game, the only thing about women I want to tell you is: If you see a beautiful and sexy women walking towards you, escape to the other side of the street! That's the only way to avoid trouble.The fact that there is a book called M.A.C.K. Tactics about mix of seduction and hostage negotiations tells you with whom you are dealing with."
1,Alpha male? I don't think so...,"There are two problems with the premise of this book. First, true Alpha males are monogamous and are not out trying to seduce women. Second, seduce implies making someone do something that they would rather not do. From Webster...1 : to persuade to disobedience or disloyalty2 : to lead astray usually by persuasion or false promises3 : to carry out the physical seduction of : entice to sexual intercourseAn Alpha male's prime directive is to do that is in the best interest of the 'pack', not in having sex with as many women as can be seduced. What this author is describing is a Leglifter, not an Alpha male. While men (mostly Leglifters) might want to read this Bible of the seducers, women should be reading Everything You Need To Know About Men...You Can Learn From Dogs...that way they can tell the Alphas from the Leglifters."
1,just a rehash from other seduction books,It seems like the author read a lot of seduction books and rehashed some of the information from other books. There is nothing new or profound in that book that's going to make you an 'alpha male'. All the information he puts in the book can now be found on different forums and blogs.Also having been on his mailing list I see that the author is always promoting other guys seduction material- so if he has the answer and his book is supposed to make you an alpha male- why does he promote other teachers stuff all the time?Answer: this guy is just a marketer trying to make money. I don't think he is an alpha male- just a keyboard jockey at best...
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"The information in this book is amazing and can be used immediately. But be ready to work on yourself, as the information in this book is mainly directed toward fixing yourself and becoming a dominate ""alpha male"". I couldnt put it down and within a few chapters, I was already developing a different frame of mind. The things learned here are so mindblowing, yet so simple at the same time that it should almost be common sense. It's hard to explain. Just know that if you read it and seriously take it to heart and put forth in your life what this book explains, you will not be disappointed. Your confidence will be built up so that your sexual frame of mind will go from ""whatever I can get"" to ""whatever I choose"". Insecurties will wave bye-bye in no time, but only if you work at it. At least thats what happened to me."
3,it was OK,"This book made some good points, however, there was a lot of points that I couldn't connect to, and felt had been a little too contrived for my taste, however, this will indeed help beginners in regards to pick up and confidence."
4,Great Book,"The info provided on being an alpha male is fabulous, but it is only covered briefly compared to the rest of the book. But that section is worth the value of the book. The other info is very important, but it is covered in other books as well. I found the alpha male info very insightful and in a way revolutionary in the area of relationships. There are too many men, that are bunch of wimps, it could all be changed with a different point of view. And that point of view would in turn change the actions of a man for the better. This book provides that crucial information."
4,"Excellent book for social skills, confidence, self esteem","This is an excellent book which helps you to go from just being friends to escalating the relationship to the point where either 1) you date her or 2) she's not interested and you focus your efforts elsewhere.I am someone who's comfortable talking to women but needed help getting to the next step.The book only gets four stars because he suggests meeting (trying to pick up women) in places like malls and supermarkets. Much better to meet women where you see each other again (through friends, work, school, volunteer organizations, etc.)"
4,pretty good,"has a lot of good tips, but just like anything in life, the main lesson is to be confident and do what you want"
4,useful book for would-be voyagers,"I enjoyed the book and feel that it enables someone(like myself)who is taking the first steps toward long distance cruising.to avoid errors on purchasing an appropriate boat.Written with definite affection for thesimple ,cruising sailboat without getting hung up on extraneous,expensive extras."
4,The only book of its kind,"Imagine spending less than $10,000 on a boat that can take you around the world. This book is your handbook to making that dream a reality. The lone star I did not give to the book is only in honor of those boats Mr. Vigor left off the list."
4,"A good placeto start, but...","There should be more books like this for young sailors to read. His writing style is good - the information presented is good, but it is true he omitted some boats which should have been included. That said, how many people have sailed in every possible boat between 25 and 40 ft that might be capable off shore? I like the emphasis on inexpensive boats. In addition to this book be sure to read J. Fitzgerald's ""Sea-Steading"" , Pardey's books, and Hiscocks. You don't need an expensive boat full of all the latest gadgets to sail the oceans!"
4,Great Information but Needing a 2nd Edition,"The edition of the book that I have was published in 1999. It was a very helpful book to guide me in my selection of my first sailboat. The general principles that John Vigor advocates will be valid indefinately. I found his ""In Comparison"" ratings and his ""Known Weaknesses"" sections valuable. His ratings of comparative seaworthiness, speed, and comfort help anyone selecting a small cruising sailboat. John has made a great contribution with this book. That being said, it would be nice to get a new edition. In particular, it would be valuable to get John's views on other potential bluewater sailboats easily cruised and handled by two people. What are his views on other boats in 28' to 32' size? I suggest the 1999 upper price limit of $50K should be increased. How about a limit of $100K? John's opinions on selected other potential boats from Beneteau, C&C, Catalina, Ericson, Island Packet, and Tartan would make it worth while to buy a new edition."
5,A great source of quick info,"If you are looking for a true bluewater sailboat,and need some info to narrow down your choices this book is a great place to start.It list the good and bad of each boat,sail area and availibility in some cases.There are a few suprises for each boat in the weaknesses and strength catagories,and in saftey at sea ratios."
2,Another missprinted book.,Book looks ok except the first 35 pages are missing (p35-82 printed twice.)I see another customer had the same problem 4 months ago.
4,If you want a cruising boat: start here!,"After spending years and years devouring sailing magazines and other information sources, I was trying to get serious on finding a cruising boat. Not being independently wealthy, I tried to find quality information on proven designs which were 'large enough' to cruise, but 'small enough' to afford.John Vigor's book was a god-sent. It provided me with a starting point and the information on each boat which allowed me the necessary pre-selection for a more detailed search. As pointed out in other reviews, the reports from actual boat owners are invaluable..... by the way, I ended up purchasing a Westsail 32"
1,Defective book,The book I received is missing chapters 1-6. It repeats chapters 7-13 and then flows to the end. Guess what? Replacement received has the same problem. Any body paying attention to the store?
1,Not Geniune Eureka product as indicated,"The item is not a genuine Eureka filter as the picture and description indicate. I received an aftermarket filter.It may be a good filter, and I might have purchased it anyway, but I don't like being deceived. There was another review with the same issue. This should have been corrected."
3,Advertised Picture is NOT Accurate,"Looking at the picture (bottom right corner), you will note that it reads ""60285C."" The ""C"" and the ""Premium"" ""True HEPA filter"" were what I was expecting, but that's not what I received from Allergy Be Gone - mine was 60285F.This filter is a HEPA and details on the packaging claim if filters ""airborne pollutants 0.3 microns or larger,"" so it's seems comparable to the True HEPA.It's just a vacuum filter, but it's still nice to know what you are buying."
3,"Not bad, but the previous titles were far superior","The highly anticipated 'update' to the Wizard series.Some problems:- Some of the interviewees weren't really traders!?!??!- Expected more 'modern' trading info. For example, what about some discussion on how technology enhances or is used by day traders who trade from home on private accounts?Nonetheless a good book:- Great writing style. I just love it. It's easy to read and has great clarity.- Been waiting for aaaaaaaages for this update, and it hasn't disappointed.Definitely worth reading if you're into the previous 2 wizard books."
2,what a joke!!,"What is the point of doing an interview with traders who act like they have some kind of secert. Wake up people, there is no secret. the secret is mastering yourself. once you have done that and you follow the basic rules of trading, the money will follow. It cracks me up when these traders say they do not want to talk about thier methods. The trend I see is these traders get burned out and go on to writing books and doing seminars and teaching. If they are so successful, lets hear how they became successful. The only part about the book I enjoyed was on Mark Cook. About his persistence to do well. Save your money and learn how to master your own mind. Get trading for a living by mark douglas."
2,Why write another???,"I am sorry, but this book should not even have been written. If you are at all interested use your money for his first and classic Market Wizards book. The last two have not really been worth the money or time."
1,Rushed to get this one in,"Schwager has probably been too busy trading or better said trying to trade to devote himself to this book in the same way he did to the last ones. He had to do it fast because ""in a rare speaking event, Jack Schwager - Being presented the 'Trader's Hall of Fame' award."" Which is given out by one of the booksellers of trading books. The trader's hall of fame award, Please! May I suggest that you dig out Jesse Livermore and give him the award first?I liked the first book. The second book was okay. This book is a waste of money. Sorry Jack, but you ruined a good success story by publishing this mediocare book!"
1,Not nearly as good as the first two Market Wizards' book,"This book seems like it was rushed to press. It's not nearly as in depth as the other two Market Wizard books. And the interviewees seem to suffer from ""Survivoritis."" They know they are being watched and read now and they guard their words so carefully as to make the interviews pretty much worthless.I have read the first two Wizards again and again and this book is nowhere near their quality. Avoid!"
5,"Another great ""Wizards""","While the first ""Market Wizards"" is truly a classic, I love all of the ""Wizards"" books. They are easy to pick up, read a quick chapter, and get some insight into professional trader's thoughts. Of course, one needs much more study to develop their own trading system, but reading and re-reading the Wizards books can encourage you when you've had a tough run, and understand thoughts, fears, and successes of trading."
4,Should be in the reading list of PMs,a rare chance to pick the brains of some of the best HF managers. a must read for the PMs.
1,nothing helpful,Too much useless background on traders. No substantial help for the average trader or investor.
4,Excellent read...great for traders at all levels,"It really doesn't matter at what level and style that you trade at, I think you'll find this an interesting read. Most likely you won't use the specific tips provided in the book, but advice about what mentality and behavior it takes to be a successful trader. Enjoy!"
4,Great book for beginning investors,"Collection of interviews with investors and fund managers who have consistently delivered outstanding returns. The book is full of great advice and strategies without going to far into technical detail. Each interview contains unique advice, strategies and interesting stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in investing from beginners to seasoned veterans."
3,I found the same info elsewhere.,"Well I do agree with the previous reviewer's comment that this book isn't that user friendly. And, answer his dosage question, I went to the site where I buy my supplements, iHerb, to see what they said about Chitosan. They have two different products and each offers detailed explanations of what Chitosan is and how much to take. A friend at the gym takes two with water one half hour before meals. That corresponds with the iHerb information. I think Hennen and Elkins were a little hasty in getting their book to press and didn't take time to proof and edit."
1,mystical pseudo-biology does not a novel make,"I usually really, really like L'Engle, but this book deserved to be flung full-force against a wall. A preachy, incoherent plot, filled with wooden characters (helpfully named things like 'Kali' and 'Arcangelo' so you can tell the good guys from the bad guys), and awful mystical science which explains how some animals are intrinsically evil.Yuck. Go read the 'Wrinkle in Time' trilogy instead."
3,A strange series of events,"Adam is a young college student who has been chosen to assist the famous Doctor O'Keefe in his experiments off the coast of Portugal. En route, Adam meets the enigmatic Kali who warns him about the doctor. He's bewildered by this odd girl, and soon finds himself an unwitting pawn in a dangerous game. Adam has to figure things out for himself and place his loyalty wisely because of the sinister events in which he finds himself entangled. ""The Arm of the Starfish"" is a great thriller that gets especially compelling towards the end."
5,One of her very best books for children (and adults),"I have read almost all of Madeleine L'Engle's fiction, and this is my favorite book of hers written for children, hands down. Don't let that stop you from reading it if you are an adult! This is a crisply plotted, tense novel that moves with speed and grace. Attention, screenwriters: It would make a great movie! It deals with universal issues and moral dilemmas that many people face, and it provides juicy, admirable characters to identify with in their struggles with life. I'm telling you, it will be time well spent if you give it a read, and you will come out of the experience changed, if you have the courage to let this book touch you."
5,"quick, involving read","While at times I felt the urge to give Adam a smack, I suppose I'm even more irrational running on three days of no sleep. Actually, I'm just irrational, period. (Hurrah for dumb Americans!) Still, it's very obvious who the ""good guys"" are.The book has its flaws, but I definitely found it to be interesting and fast-paced, and I did like Adam despite his occasional lapses (which were, for the most part, excusable). Joshua, however, is the character that really stood out to me. Him and Poly, and of course, Macrina. Unfortunately, that just made me horribly depressed at the end. -_- (I knew it was coming, too, thanks to ""A Ring of Endless Light."" Still depressing.)"
5,Highly Reccommended!,I liked this book because there was something going on the whole book right from the beginning! The kind of book that you don't wanna stop readin!
2,Not for me!!!!,I am in the 4th and 9years old grade and we had to read this book for school did not like it at all. I would of given it a one but my brother that is 16 years old loves this book
4,Still good today,"I have been buying up this set for a friend and reading most of them ahead of time. My friend requested this one because one of the characters is in the other series by L'Engle. As a scientist, I found some parts not quite realistic but close enough and other parts were amazingly still holding up today. I am not sure about such a young teen boy being able to do all of this but honestly, this was a pretty good story. If you have enjoyed any of the Austin family or related stories, you will very much enjoy this one. It reads a little like a thriller and has some enjoyable cultural references. I would like to especially commend the publisher; while these are paperbacks, the covers of this series are beautiful."
2,Not for the uninitiated,I had to buy this book for class. Even the professor stated that the book was heavy going and has to be reread over and over again to understand it. There are examples but they really don't go over them in enough detail. This book is really for someone who already has a good user knowledge of excel and somewhat familiar with solver. Many of my classmates have expressed dissatisfaction with the contents and how it was written. My main complaint is that there are not enough examples to illustrate the many new concepts found in this book. This is a difficult subject and the book doesn't make it easier.
1,Unnecessarily difficult to understand,"This book is makes a difficult subject even more difficult. It assumes that you already know alot of the concepts in it. It kin of leaves you stumbling around in the dark. I hate this book and the person who wrote it with a passion. A good author should be able to explain concepts in clear organized language, I do not care how difficult."
2,Confusing and Poorly Written,"Had to buy this book for my class. On the surface it looked OK -- plenty to screenshots and examples, but the problems arise when you try to read the long paragraphs. Language could have been clearer.Book assumes solid knowledge of Excel, which should be expected of students, but still, some things should not be taken for granted :)Another classic problem -- chapter 4 refers to examples mentioned in chapter 2. I hate this kind of cross-referencing !Don't buy it if you can live without it...."
5,Zina jewelry,"I worked for nine years at an upscale jewelry store that sold Zina jewelry, and I can attest it is quality merchandise. Rarely did we get returns when someone had received a Zina piece as a gift. Even more rarely did we have to return anything for repair as the pieces are of very high quality. Even more incredible was that Zina would remake a missing earring. I lost one at a football game, mailed in the ""partner,"" and got a brand-new, hand-created replacement. To find Zina jewelry on Amazon at such good prices was a thrill for me. I have already bought at least four items on Amazon to date."
3,unfinished,"I have just today located a copy of this book. I was wondering if anyone knows if Keith Miller, the author is/was a Branch Davidian? The book comes from ""Word Books"", Waco, Tx."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE of Money Even at $8,"I've never seen such a rambling, disjointed bunch of psycho-babble in all my days. This presentation gives psychology a bad name. Save your money."
5,5 Stars Isn't Enough...This Is a Must Have!!!!,"I first got this as a cassette in the early 90's and have just about worn the lyrics right off the tape! To this day, the sound of Mango's voice brings me back to Italy and driving through the small villages and winding mountainside roads. My all time FAVORITE song on this CD is ""Nella Mia Citta"" (My City) and was appropriate while visiting the Naples area of Italy...since that's where my family comes from. Mango has a beautiful voice and lyrics to match...even if you don't understand a word of Italian or have never been to Italy...you can close your eyes and his voice will take you there...check this CD out... this is a treasure!"
4,The Turbine Pilot Flight Manual,"Very informative book, a must have for any pilot transitioning from pistons to turbines. Each chapter gives precise details of what the airlines would ask you about systems etc..."
3,"Verify Book Carries CD-ROM, Would Have Given it 5 Stars but For This","The book itself is a delight to read and I would recommend it to any aspiring turbine pilot or anyone interested in learning the basics of turbine airplane operations. However, I was disappointed the book didn't ship with the CD-ROM as advertized. Returned it for a replacement copy, and wala, the same problem occurs again. So, I would advice you verify the one you're getting has the CD-ROM included, because it makes learning the systems easier. Would have given it 5 stars but for this."
5,Excellent Guide for Turbine Transition,"I've started with my jet transition training even before this book was delivered to me; I could truly say that ""The Turbine Pilot's Flight Manual"" is an excellent supplement to study materials and aircraft flight manuals given in training. This book gives a detailed explanation of the logic behind turbine aircraft systems, and discusses them in a very easy to understand manner; excellent for beginners and those transitioning to advanced systems. I would highly recommend this book, along with another book published by ASA: ""Fly the Wing,"" which in turn discusses the flight procedures in a turbine aircraft."
4,A window onto a little known piece of Pseudepigrapha,"I claim no specialized knowledge on this very esoteric subject but I have always had a lay interest in the various books of the Pseudepigrapha, one of a wide number of Para-Biblical works that are included among the so-called Lost Books of the Bible.""Disciples of the Beloved One"" as the preface says started out as the author's doctoral dissertation and at points reads as such, but I found it to be interesting and entertaining reading and very important in the way it highlights changing perceptions about the composition and authorship of the ""Ascension of Isaiah,"" a pseudegraphon that in my opinion deserves to be much better known. And if Knight is correct about when it was written the work is a unique window into early 2nd century christianity.For a briefer and more accessable introduction see Knight's ""The Ascension of Isaiah"" from Sheffield Academic Press"
3,Hardly New - first published in 1989,"If you are expecting a new book based round the 3 laws of robotics, by hte great writer Isaac Asimov, whoops. Each book has a different writer, Stephen Leigh the first, and COrdell Scotten Book 2.A man who has forgotten his name, a city that changes itself to fit the occupants, a robot form shifting robot. A tower that holds the keys to Perihelion, which is a stop in a galaxy wide warp point instantaneous transport system. This will certainly stretch your imagination.Book One starts off OK, but by book 3 you're getting bored and confused. It never seems to be going anywhere or to get tehre. I have all 6 books in hte series, but have never botehred to read past book 4.It's a shame that he has allowed this.The parallel series which is just called RObot City was better, but that was also published some time ago, and I never found beyond book 3 of 6."
1,A&E Adventure Collection: Misleading & Deceptive,"We purchased the A&E; Adventure CollectionThe A&E; Adventure Collection (Benedict Arnold / Horatio Hornblower / Shackleton / Napoleon / The Lost Battalion / Longitude)believing it to be the continuation of the Horatio Hornblower episodes. We had previously purchased the first 7 installments and were excited to find additional episodes. However, on receipt, we were disappointed to discover that the collection was in fact some of the same episodes we already owned, with additional DVDs of other, unrelated movies. On reading the return policy, we discovered that the DVDs are not returnable unless they are unopened. However, without opening the package it is impossible to discover the deception. This was our first online purchase for Amazon. HUGELY disappointed!"
5,The A&E Adventure Collection,"This is a fabulous DVD series with exceptional acting, cinematography, and costuming. Just fantastic!"
5,GREAT MOVIE SERIES!!!,"It is difficult to find a movie series of the caliber, quality, and cleanliness of Horatio Hornblower, and the 'Longitude' series is great. I highly recommend this!"
2,Not What I Thought,I thought this was Slug from Atmosphereit is not.I also bought The 3 Man Themes andthat is not SLUG either.My fault I will allways listen to the cds longbefore I buy..Martha
5,Delightful,"Initially upon listening to this CD for the first time, (and especially after hearing a number of different renditions of Elizabethan music from other performing artists), I thought this was merely a nice collection of Elizabethan melodies.I've actually heard a lot of this genre/period done pretty badly, and have to say this almost couldn't have been done better or more tastefully than this album by the Boston Camerata, et al.It is a splendid and extremely nice collection, after going over it a couple of times I have to admit it is an excellent album. Excellently orchestrated and presented.Rated five stars.Ken Cybulska"
1,Why no listing of the songs?,"I'll admit, right away, that I haven't heard the music on this CD. What I want to comment about is the fact that it is impossible to FIND OUT WHAT MUSIC IS ACTUALLY ON IT! I thought Amazon would have the list of songs, because I couldn't find out what they were at the local music shop. I already have a good number of Boston Camerata CD's and I wanted to find out what was on this one before I purchased it. The local store even has a software program which normally allows customers to find out what's contained on a CD if it isn't on the cover. The only listing for this CD was ""songs."" This isn't the first time that a Boston Camerata CD has not had the musical selections listed on the outside. Why not ALWAYS have a listing of the music on the cover? Even if it's in small font it would still be worth it. So, as of yet I haven't purchased it. How does one find out what's on it? K.Melia"
5,Still love it,"I read the paperback many years ago and got this for the Kindle Fire, mainly because I wanted to re-read it and also because I wanted an in-depth book experience for the Kindle to see if I would really like it. Long story short, this is the one that made me see that I can spend hours on a Kindle and do just fine (not to mention that I'm a David Morrell fan, anyway)."
2,What in the world is going on?,"Here you have a contrary view. This was the first book of Morrell's I have attempted to read. It will be the last. Obviously, he is popular. But I found the plot to be labyrinthine, dense, confusing, overpopulated, and after plodding along till about page 170, realizing I knew not what was going on, I threw up my hands!"
3,Hard To Keep Track of the Characters,"I read this right after I had read his books ""Testament"" (excellent) and ""The Fifth Profession"" (superb).This book was not as good as the ones I just cited. Though Morrell is undoubtedly a master of the thriller, this one seemed to have a bunch of back story that I was not privy to. I found myself not getting involved with the characters as I had in the two previous thrillers by him. I never really emotionally engaged with the huge cast of characters and found myself, therefore, reading just to finish the book. This was a great exposure for me of the value of having characters that are strong and unique. In short, the Sauls, Drews, Seths and Icicle characters seemed to blend together and I couldn't tell you a darned thing about them.I would recommend Morrell 100% to any reader but this is not my favorite by him."
2,I don't like it,"I got to maybe a hundred pages in the book, but couldn't get any further. This is not a good book. There seems to be two main characters in the book but they never interact; at least in the first hundred or so pages. Also the characters are flimsy, without depth and there is no plot. The story just winds on and on. I didn't know what the hero and heroine was trying to do even after the first hundred pages. They just seem to go on and on with their lives. They have no goal except maybe to react to what's happening to them. I do not recommend this book."
4,"Slow start, but worth the effort",The only Kate Elliot I had read was The Golden Key. King's Dragon took me by surprise. I thought it was a bit slow & predictable to start but a few nice twists proved me wrong. The characters grew on me and I started to care. Did anyone else notice the hints of reverse sexism? Nice touch!!
3,Epic and slightly confusing,"I was looking for another sweeping, epic fantasy series to emerse myself in, and a friend suggested I try this series. I admit that the first half of the book was confusing and a bit much to take in because of the sheer numbers of characters, the somewhat confusing social aspects (heavily female-centric), and the revisionist history/religion. Once I got about half way through the book, though, I was hooked. I started to ""get"" who the different characters were, and I started to understand where all this was going. It's definitely a book to ""set up"" the story. I've since gone on to read several of the other books and this series, and I can without reservation say that things get much better as the series continues, and I plan to follow this one through to completion. So, if you pick this one up it's well worth the read, keep with it!"
3,Hard to explain!,"Where to start.....I have a hard time describing this book, It is so involved and I can't even say if I love it or hate it, but I couldn't put it down either! I think I kept reading it because I wanted so much for something good to happen to the main characters. I kept thinking ""she has to get out of this situation!"" Finally after three fourths of the book it does. Then I start waiting for her to get some courage and stop acting like a beat down puppy. But instead of getting frustrated with the book and giving up on it I keep reading! Why? Iam not sure! I must like something about it because I couldn't put it down I'm just not sure what that something is yet!"
4,Excellent characters! Great series!,"I definitely enjoyed the ""King's Dragon""/Crown of Stars series. The characters were complex and interesting, and the story unfolded slowly in the beginning and then built to a fast paced... not conclusion, but stopping place. The best thing about this book is that although it was full of the fantasy staples..sorcery, battles, elves, kings, etc. it did not overuse them. You definitely will enjoy spending time with these characters, and I know I look forward to reading more about them in the future.The only reason I rated this series a 4 (instead of 5) is because the later books (especially #4 ""Child of Flame"") can be a little hard to follow at times. The many plotlines/characters are woven in a very intricate tapestry. This can be very entertaining though, after reading some of the less thought provoking fantasy series out there."
2,DUMB,"I purchased the book based on the rave reviews given by Amazon.com readers - big mistake! If you like two-dimensional characters with the depth of a puddle, this is the book for you. Elliot is frightfully unimaginative with her generous borrowing of our very own medieval customs, literature, and religion. The characters' actions and reactions are unbelievable and melodramatic. As for the plot...there are at least twenty with as many loose ends. While you do follow approximately 4 central characters, hundreds more are introduced for absolutely no purpose; some are even killed off and I'm not sure if I was supposed to care. Maybe the next book in the series helps explain half of the characters and plots introduced in the first, but I can't stomach it to find out. If it's a 5-star author you're looking for, check out Guy Gavriel Kay or Stephen R. Donaldson."
3,Attempts to be tantalizing come off as vague,"A good book lurks here, but you'll be hard pressed to find it within the mists of prose. The overall concepts and characters are intersting in the abstract. Unfortunately, they never materialize into more concrete form. The opening hints of some great conflict with powerful consequences, but then nothing more is said. Sanglant, the apparent hero, gets a few lines of cryptic dialogue and then disappears. The book's two main protagonists drift around without any direction or purpose. The evil revolt filling the 1st half of the book collapses abruptly, an apparent footnote in the overall plot. The book feels like it's building up to something, but never reaches the main event. Everything that happens feels like some plot device designed to advance the story, but to what end? Perhaps this book makes a nice prologue to the rest of the series, but taken alone, King's Dragon is overly vague and mysterious."
5,Slow start but is awesome,"When I started King's Dragon, it was very boring. I knew it was going to get better though. I wish Elliot went into more detail about the Lost Ones/Elves. They are fascinating."
4,A great book!,"King's dragon is alittle slow to start however it quickly draws you in and captivates you, except for Liath's chapter's early on which are painfully boring."
2,First 300 pages - very slow reading!,"A friend lent me this book and told me that the book was exciting, tremendous, thrilling and vivid, yet when I started reading it, I felt that Kate Elliot was dragging the story, not giving any progress, not letting the reader hold on to something. It was very frustrating reading the first 300 pages, I found myself skimming the first sentences in each paragraph. While it is perhaps a necessity of the subject matter, I felt all of the main characters were either excessively cruel or excessively weak. Some of her story lines were very confusing. Example: When St. Thecla appears to Alian and gives him the rose. I really don't grasp why Kate Elliott included this. Even though this wasn't my favourite book, I did appreciate the literary skill of Kate Elliott..."
5,Can't get enough,"I have enjoyed reading Kate Elliott's books. I have read the first two in this series and can't wait for the third to come out on paper back. I find that when I am reading a work of literature by someone else, I can clearly call up a mental picture of one of her characters to stick in that work. I have read anything from western to romance, sci-fi, fantasy, American Classics, Charles Dickens, etc. and find that her books are some of the best I have read. I would definately recommend this series to anyone who loves action, and would like to see what happens between Liath and Sanglant. I can't wait! I think that I am going to try to find her other series, Jaran, and read that."
4,A wonderful book,"Though not as good as her Jaran books, I still loved this book. The plot is tight and complex. Her characters are intelligent and full of human doubt and ambiguity. Her Jaran books are the best sci-fi works since Dune. I don't understand why people seem to love Robert Jordan's confused rambling and inane characters when they could be reading Kate Elliot!"
4,"A really good book, but......","I really enjoyed this book, but it had a problem that just really cheapend the book for me. It's a simple thing really. The author did a holesale ripe off of the Roman Catholic church. From the tearms used to address religous figures and changing the spelling of historical persons names and their writtings, for example Eusebuius wrote the Ecclesatical history, but how was it in the text Eusebi. And what I really thought was the worst were several blatent quations from the new testament, from Acts 2 for example to the names of the four gospels of the fictional church which were in the case of three gospels, slightly changed names and then then one from a noncannonical source. Other than the author's poorly borrowed christian tradition, I loved the book, I thought this portion really lacked imagination and originality."
1,One of the worst fantasy novels I've ever read,"Words won't convey how much I hated this book. I read almost all fantasy fiction that is published in the US and this is the worst I've seen yet. Kate Elliott is a dreadful fantasy writer if this is an example of what she writes.In King's Dragon, the characters are badly developed and dull, every minute little detail of the world Elliott has created is 'explained' to the detriment of what little plot line there is, and to the confusion of the reader. And her attempts at poetry were laughable.I waded through the entire book, determined to see if it got any better. It didn't. Then, I returned the next 3 books in the series to the bookstore for novels by much better fantasy writers - Margaret Weis and Tracy Hicks, and Terry Pratchett.If you really want to read good fantasy epic fiction, try Terry Goodkind, Weis and Hicks, or George R. R. Martin, not this."
1,"Too much religion, not enough good writing",I made it most of the way through the second book of this series before I couldn't take any more. There is way too much emphasis on the religion of this fantasy land and not enough good storytelling.
5,My Favorite series,"I absolutely love this series. I have been reading fantasy and sci-fi for many years, and enjoyed, loved many of them, but I haven't found one as captivating and interesting as this one. There are so many subplots and things that happen to the main characters where you go, ""hey these people are so real, they don't live in a magical land where everything goes right suddenly.""I got so frustrated while Liath was a slave to Hugh. I'm so used the main characters being able to get out of bad situations really quickly, I found that she fights back, but he is stronger. it got me sooo frustrated and I couldn't put the book down until she was free, and then something else happens to her.I didn't get as attached to Allain, though I do enjoy reading about him it isn't the same. To me, Liath is the real main character."
3,Lacking reasoning,"'Clumsy' best describes this fantasy rank-and-file member. The characters are sadly modern in spirit; the narrative logic fails every so often; the world refers constantly to that of ours; again, the understanding of history and psychology is marginal. The literary value rates as 'commonplace'.It would be a good social satire, if it were satire at all.More, it is obvious that the author tried to apply various tricks belle arte, such as taught at advanced writing seminars. Yet she applied them without taste and refining. I am giving the three star rating for the effort applied only.Clumsy, and without hope for improvement. This is the first book by Kate Elliott in my hands, and I won't care to seek the others. in fact, I am so offended by this text, as to post my evaluation of it.Yes, it is yet another petty analysis of coming of age."
2,Did someone forget the storyline?,"I am an avid fantasy reader and was seeking a new series to sink my teeth into. I read online reviews of this book before I bought it and found them quite positive. After reading 400 pages of King's Dragon, I called it quits (something I rarely do). The author spent so much time on background info for the religious and political landscape of the story, that she completely forgot about progressing the storyline itself. I didn't care about the characters and I didn't care about the story. If you like complex, detail oriented fantasy, maybe this book is for you. If you read fantasy for a rich storyline that urges you to read on and on, try something else."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Browsing through my local used bookstore I came across The King's Dragon and decided to take a chance. Two days (and two very late nights) later my chance was rewarded with characters believable in both motivation and action, very real and applicable emotional turmoil, sub-plots that make sense, and the hints of an overarching plot that will (hopefully)prove to be deeply intriguing/interesting.If you like fantasy with political intrigue, diverse races, millitary struggle, the conflicting but everpresent influences of church and state on everyday life, characters both ordinary and extraordinay, and the presence of magic, you will enjoy The King's Dragon."
3,Kick out the the hero and the heroine!,The heroine is so dumb and helpless. She is practically raped and she hardly cares! The hero is only a bit better. He got himself captured and chained with a pack of wild dogs! The only thing that makes him better than the heroine is that he is at least a commander. Alain should be the hero. He is just about the only person in this book worth reading about and the only one who does not seem helpless or hopelessly incompetent. The only parts of this book worth reading about are the parts about Alain. I think Alain should be the hero.
3,This review covers the whole series...,"This massive, multi-threaded, epic series was just barely good enough to keep me reading. I almost quit, a few times, but the characters were interesting enough that I could not quite eave them without slogging through to the end. It really was a slog at times, but there's no sense picking it apart here. The bottom line is that if this first book grabs you, then you'll probably be OK with the rest of them. If you're sticking with it because you think it might get better...I recommend letting it go and re-read GRRM for the same epic buffet feel, but with better ingredients and a more talented chef."
5,"If you love excellent epic fantasy, you *must* own this.","The complexity of this world is breathtaking, the protagonists are interesting and have wonderful arcs, the magic systems are deeply meditative. Seriously, this is right up there with Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' series - better, in fact, because 'Wheel of Time' begins to really bore one after book 6. However, I'm not sure why 'Crown of Stars' hasn't received the attention it deserves. This is a lesser-known prerequisite for all lovers of excellent, complex epic fantasy. It will keep you spellbound until there's no more to read. Buy this. It's a jewel."
4,An intesresting opening for the series,An interesting book that you just can't stop reading. All the characters in this book seem so vivid and alive. I especially liked the medieval european set up. The plot is getting better and better as you keep on reading. A must for Fantasy fans.
2,Renaissance - Transitional Album That Does Not Quite Work,"Being a long time Annie Haslam era Renaissance fan I have always been curious about the early albums before the classic lineup came to be. I checked out the first Renaissance album and was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Bering that in mind I decided to delve into ""Illusion"" hoping for a similar find. Unfortunately this one does not stack up nearly as well, and does not do nearly as much for me. The band was pretty much falling apart at this point and I think it shows on the album. The best track is ""Mr. Pine"" which featured Mike Dunford who would go on to lead the more famous next incarnation of the group. The rest of the album is a mish mash of half finished ideas and meandering instrumental interludes. The final track ""Past Orbits Of Dust"" has it's moments, but at almost 15 minutes eventually wears out it's welcome. In the end this was a transitional album that did not live up to the material that came before or after it."
3,wrong song information on the sample,i recommend Renaisanne illusuion if you liked the later classic Renaissance or the first original Renassiance lp by this band or the spin off Illusion. However be warned the song samples are not from that CD. I have the CD! Also look at the song list given on the CD photo back it shows a different set of songs.
3,"Great set, however be aware ...","You won't find many of these songs together ever again on CD, some of them you can't find on disc period. The only thing that I do not like the interviews that precede the songs here and that does knock my rating of this somewhat. I do know that this is a condension of the boxed set that was put out in the early 70's. While it's a nice set, you will have to be a hardcore fan to enjoy some of it ..."
1,Crazy stupid,"Someone else mentioned the interviews on this CD but I hadn't read it until I ordered and received this. I didn't see any mention of interviews let alone interviews that are mixed in with each of the songs. I just can't believe; who would have been stupid enough to mix the interview with the actual song in the SAME track. I mean even if you were interested in what the artists had to say(which I'm not), how many times would you want to listen to it? Even having done this they could have lessened the impact to your music listening if they had at least placed the interview AFTER the song in the track. Then at least you could have skipped forward to the next track. Someone really blew it with this one."
1,THE BIG LIE,You need to write another book this next one about 9/11 how the media and politicians were coerced by the corporate rich to make it happen.
4,Posturing Politics.,"Crawford has managed to rationilise the rivalry of the White House and government with that of the media. It truly is a war of words and subterfuge that renders the public mute. If nothing else this should encourage the media not only to give up the fight, but lanquish in the chaos and keep us all informed."
5,Attack the Messenger,"Mr. Crawford's pulling back the curtain that surrounds the media/political world that is Washington DC is both compelling and more then a little scary.His examples of how the First Amendment is damaged by the constant battling between the press and polaticans are troubling for all that believe that a free press is the only tool Americans have to protect our freedoms.Crawford's insights are sharp and unique and therefore a must read for anyone that's interested in the present art of ""the spin"" and how it's used for both good and evil."
4,One Dope Mexican & DTTX!,"Lighter Shade Of Brown are a Chicano hip hop trio from Riverside, CA that consists of O.D.M. (One Dope Mexican) & D.T.T.X. (Don't Try to Xerox) they are kind of like Cypress Hill or Funkdoobiest, yet they are not total reeferatics like B-Real or Son Doobiest. Brown & Proud is an alright album, though I much rather prefer Hip Hop Locos!Brown & Proud is no different than any of their other albums, though I luv their Re-mixes of the hit song Spill The Wine! El Varrio is a pretty tight song, so is the layed back good day song On a Sunday Afternoon. Best songs are 1, *2, *3, 4, 7, 9, 10 & 11."
3,Not a bad summer scent,"Halston unbound is not a bad summer scent. The top notes can be a bit much til it starts to dry down. In the top notes, I get tomato plant, yes plant, not tomato fruit, also a heavy pepper smell, and an herbal quality, maybe sage. The base notes are kinda woody, unfortunately, it doesn't last very long on my skin, so I never really get to enjoy the base notes. Because of the opening, I would recommend trying before you buy, I can see how some would be turned off by the opening.I rated 3 stars because I think its just OK, there are many, many better fragrances out there, but I can wear it for the short time it lasts."
5,the best entfuhrung on the market,I have been listening to entfuhrung since 1970 and have heard many recording. This album is definitely the best...far better that Solti overpowering on London with the flamboyancy of Edita Gruberova. This is definitely the set to buy. Christie's tempo is right on the money and all singers are in excellent shape and provide best interpretation. I just love this set.
4,Seamless integration,"The interface works well, I don't have any problems navigating through my IPOD menu, though it is different. I do wish that the song ID would pop to the screen as a default setting to mimic the IPOD GUI.Regarding the installation: it was a piece of cake, but I wish the long IPOD cable would detach from the interface unit, that would give you more through dash options."
1,"This product sucks, dont waste your time or money!!!","The O N L Y reason you will like this product is if you never use anything but random.. or listen only to playlists. you might as well not even try searching for a specific song because you will have arrived at your destination before you get to it. it takes like 3 seconds to go from one artist to another so if you have 30 gigs of music or so, it will take you foever. not to mention you cant search for a song while listening to music either because as you are cycling through arists it is constantly trying to play the first song available. and fucntion of the ipod is locked while connected. the displays suck also.. only 8 characters, and only one display at a time.i had the cd rb10 or whatever its called before this.. aux adapter with RCA inputs. so you get a rca to stereo connector and charge the ipod with a cigerette lighter adapter.. little more messy, but full functionality."
5,Works great,"I have a Pioneer AVIC-Z2 and an ipod classic. This adapter works great. Full ipod control. It is not just a cable as shown in the picture. There is a box that needs to be installed as well, so you might need it to be professionally installed."
5,Seamless Integration,"I bought this despite some of the reviews about slowness using the menu. I have not seen that at all. It took about 10 minutes to install and it works great. I installed it in a 2006 WRX with a Pioneer head unit. My Apple 8gig touch plugs right in with no issues and charges the whole time, even if the car is off. The menu on my head unit is slick, it shows the a picture of the iPod and the menu is quick and easy to use. My head unit is a Pioneer 6800MP. I recommend this for anyone using an iPod in their car, it was so easy to install and it sounds awesome.Pioneer CD-IB100ii iPod Interface Adapter Control your iPod with your Pioneer stereo"
5,i pod adapter,"very easy straight foward install. great item, if you buy a pioneer face and have an ipod this is a necessity. great product all around worth the extra 50 bux"
1,Disappointed,"HelloDissatisfied with the service, I have not received my product, sent him to another address.Please who can help me solve my case, I have sent several mail both the salesperson to Amazon without solution.Yours.Raul Vecchionacce"
1,"Review of Amazon process, not the product","Hello,I purchased the AVIC-D2, XM and the iPod kit from Amazon. I then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup. After 3.5 hours they failed.I decided that I'd return the items because I needed to get an alternative gift before Christmas and I didn't have time to find another way to get it installed. I was able to return the D2, but the GEX-P10XMT and the IB100II are not returnable. It turns out that Amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies. Had I realized that Amazon would sell me something that I can't return I would have purchased elsewhere. At this point I will never purchase anything else from Amazon ever again."
5,a stimulating book,"C Algorithms for Real-Time DSP, by Paul Embree, is a stimulating book. When I finished reading it, I went straight to my workstation and started experimenting with DSP algorithms. Embree clearly knows this subject and presents it in a straightforward manner. This is a refreshing change from the academic approach taken by the seven digital-signal processing books currently on my bookshelf. Not that Embree doesn't reference some heavy math. C Algorithms for Real-Time DSP is not for the mathematically weak of heart. To feel comfortable with the book, you should be familiar with time- and frequency-domain math as well as filter terminology&emdash;topics Embree reviews in the first part of the book. Reading this section reminded me of how my entire high-school education was summarized in my first week of college."
4,Interesting for students,"Within this book, various algorithms can be found. The algorithms are implemented on various DSPs (TI C3x',AD 21xxx and etc) as well. Would be a great reference for students working on their DSP projects."
5,"beautiful, creative, absorbing, and my kids love it!","I bought this book because I love Steve Jenkins' other books. His technique is so creative--the papers he uses (I wonder if he makes some of them) and how he uses them evoke so much--texture, color, temperature. My 8 and 10 year old boys loved this book, and we are Mt. Everest nuts. There's plenty of room on the bookshelf for books with photos (Ghosts of Everest: The Search for Mallory & Irvine is truly wonderful), but Jenkins' book is not only informative--very!--but it is poetry with paper. I highly recommend this book, along with Jenkins' other terrific books."
2,No photographs detract from the book,"I think the book could be interesting and educational for children, it just doesn't carry the punch it should because there are no photographs - only cut paper collages. While I certainly do appreciate the artistic value of the illustrations, part of the allure of Everest is seeing the majestic, and terrifyiing, landscape. Keep the wondreful collages, just add some photographs. The Khumbu Icefall just can't be captured in a collage."
4,Great stand for the price!,"I owned several of these since they were so cheap. The stand itself holds up very well, i did however have a problem with it occasionally falling over. It is stable on hardwood floors though."
1,Horrible,Horrible stand i would not recommend for anyone. Not even a beginner drummer thought it would be a decent temporary replacement but it wasnt. horrible stand.
4,Another good album,"Kate Rusby has set herself some pretty high standards in the past, and The Girl Who Couldn't Fly holds up pretty darn well. Kate's voice is in fine form, the arrangements are as clever and complimentary as ever, and there are definitely some gems here (Game of All Fours-charmingly saucy, The Lark, Bonnie House of Airlie-both way up there in the heartbreaking marks, Mary Blaize-brilliant instrumental work, Elfin Knight-great writing from Kate). This only gets four stars for two reasons: 1- it lacks that feeling of wholeness (consistency of tone and vision) that made Underneath the Stars so enjoyable 2-a few of Kate's songs (Moon Shadow, No Names, Fare Thee Well) seem a little lightweight in terms of songwriting-- more Old Man Time (from her 1st album) than Falling or Underneath the Stars (from her last)."
4,Wow Wow Wow,"I love the humor Ms. Hunter always puts into her stories. I love her heros too. She is a superb writer. She really knows how to steam it up. The chemistry between these main characters is right on. My only complaint is that the main female character appeared a little too simple minded. In my opinion a man as intellegent as this story's hero, would most likely need someone a little more mentally stimulating. Other wise loved, loved, loved it."
2,not great quality,"The product shipped in great time. However, I am not terribly pleased. The on-off switch was detached and I had to take apart the base of the product to re-glue it. It works fine now, but I don't think I'll be buying from this company again."
3,"Predictable, but quite entertaining","A wealthy Louisiana man plays by Burt Reynolds is concerned that his young and beautiful wife (Saffron Burrows) might be unfaithful. To test her, he pays $10,000 to one of his employees (Peter Facinelli) to seduce her and another $40,000 if he can get her to sleep with him.The plot twists are generally predictable for the genre, but the performances of three principal actors are good enough for the viewers to sit through the entire movie. Burt is fine, Saffron Burrows is georgous and Peter Facinelli is competent enough in the seduction acts.The picture is Full Screen only and not bad looking, capturing New Orleans in vivid color and in dark tones in the less colorful neighbourhood. The 5.1 Sound is OK, overall a good rental DVD."
3,"Steamy, but still only ""pretty good""","Why does Burt Reynolds always look like he's about to break into laughter? He's really not a very good actor these days and the severely streched look of his numerous facelifts is a bit disconcerting, although his toupee is a stunner.That trivia aside, the plot is a good one and the acting is quite good, although the lady in question could use a slightly greater emotional range, considering the intensity of the plot. There are some surprises, too. I'd suggest buying the film so long as you realize that this is not the kind of film you watch over and over again, like, say, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" or ""Rebecca"" (the original version).The New Orleans setting of ""Tempted"" has the wind-chimy flavor and humidity of Kathleen Turner's ""Body Heat"" from a while back, but lacks the intensity. With Body Heat, it was real passion. With this film, it's real sex -- not the same thing.It's pretty good but not worth rating above 3 stars."
3,about this movie tempted......,"I feel that the story base(medium transmission) of this movie is no good in the sense that money is the greatest for people to do all sorts of things they want and noone could stop these(just what is like in this movie). There are two sex scene in this movie, the first been violent(the eating utensils crash on the floor when the actress was pinned down on the table) and the other is at the staircase. For those whom like to own movies that contains some sexual scenes, this suits your requirements.What I can say about this movie is that the entire movie is still o.k... ..."
3,Decent for beginners BUT,"I'm a beginner, and I started with this book. The notation and the introductory texts in the book are good, but the song tabs simply are not challenging enough. I know the book is made for beginners, but many of the important notes in songs are left out or over-simplified. I've had to improvise on a few in order to play more accurately.I just think the songs aren't as challenging as they need to be in order for improvement to be seen. Yes, it's a good introduction to the harmonica. But it will keep you a beginner."
4,He loves it,"Was a present. He seems to enjoy having a guide. Will be used more this summer, will have him rate at a later time."
5,Excellent book.,Just received this instruction book. it looks like it will be an excellent training guide to learn how to play the harmonica.
4,Instant Harmonica: Quick and Easy Instruction for the BeginnerPatrick Byrne,"Simple book for true beginner. It is fine if you want to play old fashioned tunes note by note. If you want to play chords, or be creative, this is not it."
4,Good,This book was a gift for my husband with his first harmonica. Its easy and he quickly started with songs. Some if the songs are unknown to us though that's why I gave it a 4
2,"If you like not learning harp, buy this","Well let's make this short: three pages of really poor teaching on how to put the mouth and how to hold the harp, all the rest are tabs of ol' campfire stuff. Don't get me wrong, it can be fun but for instant harmonica well, you do not learn anything about...playing harp. And some really lame jokes such as 'the guy who invented the staff, what a guy' doesn't really incline me to read this dull book.You can have so much stuff online for free about how to play, keep your money in your pocket right near the harmo and have fun!"
2,NOT a kids book - BE WARNED,"I shop Amazon almost exclusively for products but almost never submit a review but in this case I felt it was necessary. I purchased this book as a Christmas present so I could work with my 7-year old son who plays the piano and is contantly whistling a tune. He'll love the harmonica. Overall, the instruction in the book looks solid and many of the songs look like they'll be alot of fun. However - please be warned - I removed about 1/3 of the book because the songs were not appropriate for kids. I didn't expect the book to be filled with kiddie songs but did think they'd be appropriate for a wide audience. One song mentioned marijuana and LSD, another was all about a pending divorce and many were sad tunes of love affairs gone bad. When I saw the word ""Beginner"" I assumed the content would be OK for a kid but that assumption was wrong."
4,Quite Good for Beginners,"No real advanced harmonica lessons in this little book, but the price is right and it a good start for the harp beginner. Also going for it, the book has a lot of songs set in simple harmonica notation."
4,easy to use,"My father, who is 70, was delighted to get this book. He's had a harmonica for years, and has actually started playing again. He says he should be able to use this book easily.Tonja Taylor, author of LEGACY: Crafting Your Child's Future With Words"
5,Wonderful product,My son just received a harmonica for Christmas - he is a law student at LSU - I bought him the book so that he could learn to play - he stated that the book was easy to follow and moved quickly - he loves it! It was shipped promptly and in excellent shape - thanks!
5,"Like It, Lovett, Want more of it","This book is an excellent source. Lovett traces the development of the current trends in banking and financial law, beginning with the First Bank of the U.S. The book also explains how banking law evolved with respect to the existing economic and political climate. Buy this book! There is no better synopsis of banking/financial law."
5,My son loved this book,My four year old has had me read Hurricanes to him again and again . Ms. Hopping presents scientific facts in such an engaging format that he really enjoys the story. I recommend this and her other Wild Weather stories.
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I've been listening to Mango's 'Sirtaki' album for many years now after having found it as an American in Italy. I love 'Sirtaki' for its catchy atmospheric, electronic sound and solid vocals. I was hoping for more of the same with 'Come L'Acqua', but, alas, am pretty disappointed. It is filled with more traditional, ballady songs that are ultimately pretty boring and forgettable. No doubt Mango is a very talented singer, musician, and song-writer. I'll be sticking with 'Sirtaki', though."
5,Fascinating great reading,Just finished this fascinating collection of papers. Very well done and extremely readable I thought this a great find.
3,Disappointed,A nice little CD but not nearly as I expected or as relaxing as his Sea of Glass which I love.... I rarely listen to this one.
3,"Ok, not great.","Product did NOT remove shellac/laquer mix easy and left a film on the wood, took quite a bit of elbow grease to get it looking ok. Would not buy again."
1,Problem with refinisher!!,"I recently used a product from Minwax called Antique Furniture Refinisher. I've ruined 5 kitchen cabinet doors($500 replacement cost). The instructions on the can say to use steel wool. I did and the product reacted with the steel wool and caused small particles from the steel wool to embed into the grain on the light oak cabinets. The doors now have black spots all over them. I talked to Minwax and sent them digital pictures of the doors. Their reply was the pictures were not clear enough and their product could not have caused the problem I described. I got no help from them. The second time back to store, with my destroyed door, I was told I shouldn't have used the steel wool. They sold me some stripper and I tried unsuccessfully to correct the problem. Warning! Do not follow the instructions on the can."
5,Tyndale's Bible,"Excellent Bible, though not the complete Old Testament. Very good quality paper and a good size print. Also in paragraph style which is much more readable that the KJV style of verses. I find it easier to understand and follow than just about all other versions and would highly recommend this and Tyhndale's New Testament to anyone really wanting to understand the scriptures. I now see what other people have said about Tynedale's translation being the best. I use this with the Amplified Bible."
4,Good message for younger children,Video kept my children's attention and my 4-yr-old got the message loud and clear. Nicely done. It is a little too long to keep their attention but it is definitely the best video out there on the subject.
3,wanted more,Its ok. My kids kind of got the message after my wife and I explained a lot of wha was going on. We then reviewed the tape again. Its just ok
3,Good but LOTS of sound effects...too busy,"I love the messages this video sends and teaches kids, however the sound effects are a bit overpowering and sometimes it's hard to hear what the person is even saying. I feel it takes away from the message to have so much going on at one time. If it lost some of the sound effects/noise and kept to the other entertaining/informational matter it would be a 5 star for me."
4,Excellent Resource,I am grateful that there was a resource like this. I wanted my children to be empowered and discerning. It is very easy to understand and follow even for my youngest(6 years old).
5,MUST HAVE for Strange Danger Teaching,"Don't Knows and Kinda Knows . . . My children and I LOVED The Safe Side's ""Safe Side Super-Chick"". She has a silly way of teaching kids about common sense saftey, which can be a struggle for parents. The role playing performed by safety chick are histerical. I am so happy to now have a great way to teach my kids to stay on the"" safe side""."
5,Great help in teaching kids about strangers,"The video is kept my kids attention the whole time. The ""safe side super chick"" is a little wacky; however, the lesson was learned and my kids want to watch the video. I would recommend this to any parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles etc., just be sure to watch with your children."
5,Great video!!!,"This video is just what we were looking for to talk about strangers. The creators made a serious topic fun... which keeps a kids interest. Both my husband and I watched the video with our kids (4-1/2 & 6) and paused the video at certain points to either reiterate a point, ask a question or just to make sure everyone understood. For the rest of the weekend, the kids only wanted to watch this video."
5,WONDERFUL Dvd!!,This is a FANTASTIC & funny dvd! My 8 yr. old daughter loves it & we are watching it again for the 2nd time today. Has wonderful tips for keeping kids safe for both parents & kids. I highly recommend it!
3,helpful but not great,"My kids were entertained by this video. It worked well as an intro to some discussions about safety. It was a little confusing and annoying... But I did like that it didn't make strangers sound too horribly frightening. I wanted to talk to my kids about staying safe without making them feel like everyone is out to get them, and this video does accomplish that."
2,My kids found it boring,"I think that this video has good intentions however, most of the things in video are common sense situations that most if not all parents teach their children in reference to strangers. What bothered me was that my kids walked away from the tv periodically. My 6 year old watched a bit but then got bored. My 4 year old liked the music but didn't pay attention to what was going on in the video which defeats the purpose of it. Although every child is different both of mine were not interested."
3,Concerned about food images,"I really liked this DVD on first pass. However, I am really disturbed by the way that the Super Chick is constantly cramming food in her mouth. It is a disappointment to me that Julie Clark allowed this to be in one of her videos--especially because she has daughters. This is a subtle message about unhealthy eating that a role model is giving to our kiddos. I love this video, but would love to see a remake without the binge eating."
5,Very good lessons,This is a very good video that keeps my children's attention while passing on excellent information. John Walsh & Julie Clark are respected names in the world of children - and they don't disappoint.
5,Must See DVD,"If you have children, this is an essential addition to your DVD collection. Not only is it informative, kids love it."
5,A must have!!!,This is my standard gift to all my childrens' friends. This provides vital life-saving information to kids in a fun and entertaining way.
5,safety chick,My son loves Stranger Safety. They advertised it on the missing persons show and my 6 yearold didn't know there was strangers though I have explained them to him many times. I also got I Am Not a Target(teaches detours and physical force to get away). The two go realy good together. With the recent attempted abduction of a 11 yearold in her back yard in a small town In colorado I sent these dvd's to the babysitter. She thought they were great for the kids ranging from 1 1/2 to 12 years of age. My son begs to watch these two over and over and is actually practicing the things they teach.
5,Must have!,This is a great safety video. My kids have watched it over and over. It presents safety rules in such fun ways that are easy for children to remember.
1,Don't let the Baby Einstein endorsement fool you,"This video was a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME & MONEY. My husband & I TRIED to watch this prior to letting our boys watch it. We found it to be nonsensical & could barely suffer through half of it. We thought maybe we just ""didn't get it"", maybe we are too critical & it is SUPPOSED to be for children after all. Our kids were uninterested. Guess I shouldn't expect a video to do what we (as parents) are supposed to be doing in the first place."
4,My kid's like it,"I think that this does a good job of warning kids about the dangers of the world without scaring them. I am glad that I got it for them because I really didn't know how to approach the subject, and they really have learned from it. It is also entertaining and they have watched it probably 10 times."
1,A terrible DVD,It's a very disappointing DVD. I had high expectations because it was produced by John Walsh. My son asked me to turn it off because it was to loud. Unfortunately there are no other product out there. The only really nice one I found was the Berenstains Stranger book. I can highly recommend it.
5,Great video for kids!,"A friend recommended this to me, and it is wonderful. My daughter loves it, she quotes the movie all the time. Watching it together also opened up the dialogue about strangers. She asks to watch it all the time. The tips are great-I really feel like watching this movie has made my daughter much safer!"
5,Great !!!!!,This is not only a learning tool for children but for adultstoo. This is must for children...
4,Cubscout Mom Beamimg,I am a cubscout Den mother and we had to talk to the kids about stranger danger and my son keep begging me for the video .I purchased it and we watched it together .Smart and funny without being scary .Catchy songs .We used it in all our differant age dens and then I took it to my sons aftercare and they showed it on a in service day .The kids loved it .A+++
5,This DVD will save a childs life!!!!!!!!,"I was a big fan of the Baby Einstein videos, and I recently saw John Walsh on Fox talking about this video coming out, so I purchased it right away. My 4 year old daughter has watched it at least 20 times in the last 3 or 4 days, and walks around quoting the movie ""Help, this is not my mom, help, this is not my dad"", which is what it teaches should a stranger attempt to lure your child away. In the past I've tried explaining strangers to her and why we don't leave with one, etc., but she never got it. This video did the trick somehow! I have no doubt this video will ultimately save a childs life out there. I would not let the day go by without ordering this for your little one. It may save their life. I also recommend buying a copy for your childs daycare or school. THANK YOU Julie Clark and John Walsh."
5,Best thing I could do for my daughter,"I bought this video for my 5 year old daughter. She watches it almost daily. We have watched it with her and answered any questions she had. She automatically follows the advice given on this video everytime we encounter a ""Don't Know"". She is also aware of other kids around her and says things like, ""Hey where is that little girl's safe side adult?!"". I think this is the best thing you could do for your young kid. The content is hysterical for them to watch but is something they can relate to and put to work in their everyday life. It also helps you as a parent/grandparent/aunt/uncle realize how to tackle this scary subject without making the kids scared of everyday situations."
5,a must to open the avenue of discussion about strangers!!!,"We bought this when my daughter turned 4. She is now 5 and brings this video to us to watch, she has watch it sooo many times. This video is fun and informative for kids w/o being to scary. I absolutely love it as a parent. It opens the avenue for discussion without being to overwhelming. Thanks a million. I will give it to friends for their kids."
4,Stranger Safetly,I like this video and my five year old son likes watching it. Its a video that you need to watch with your child so that you can discuss it. It gave me an opportunity to talk about strangers and being safe and give him different ideas on how strangers can approach him and what to do and who is a stranger and who is not. Its a good starting point...but like with most things with kids this age...you have to watch it many times and discuss it frequently if you want your child to remember it.
5,Ordered this for young children,I ordered this video as part of their gifts for 4 families of children ranging from 3-8 years old and all were pleased with it and the content.
5,Really good - kids enjoy!,I recommend this video! It is quite funny but gets the safety messages across. My kids love it and want to watch it over and over.
4,"Stranger Safety DVD, Safeside DVD","They arrived quickly and in great condition. The kids have been entertained by the videos and not scared. I am able to discuss issues with them using the video and ask them questions. With all the crazy people out there, you can't prepare the kids enough."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"It's been months now since I've ordered and watched this video but it was so disappointing that I do not quite remember all that is wrong with it. The first thing that comes to my mind is how annoying the main character is. She is all over the place in this video. And the red, yellow and green light thing just doesn't work for me. My daughter is 6 years old and it did not catch her attention (much to my surprise)! I just didn't like this video. I feel I could do a better job talking to my daughter about the danger of some strangers, as well as obtaining literature or books from the library. Don't waste your money or time with this."
5,The Safe Side - Stranger Safety,"This is an excellent video to help teach children about strangers, without scaring them. It's funny too, which keeps them paying attention."
5,Excellent Lessons on Stranger Safety,"This movie was recommend to me by a parent in our play group as a resource to help teach stranger safety in a way that is helpful and not terrifying. My son (age 4) absolutely loves the movie and it has opened a dialogue for discussing safety issues concerning the ""don't knows"" and ""kinda knows"" he encounters every day. I recommend this movie to all parents of young children and I believe this would be an excellent resource in an elementary school library as well."
3,You only get one - not four.,"I do like the little green turtle with jingle bells, but I thought I would be getting all four. I wasn't given a choice as check-out. What's up with that?!"
1,Choking hazard,We thought this would be a fun noisy toy for our 5 month old. When we got it however we were worried about if a bell came off he could choke on it. We put away until he is older.
1,Find another resource,"As a neophyte to knife collecting I thought a book with the sub-title ""The Complete Handbook of Knife Collecting"" would be a great start. NOT. There are bits and pieces in the book that are interesting. It lists the different materials used for knife handles, but fails to give even a basic idea of how to identify them. In the listing of American Knife Makers, the list isn't alphabetical. For a resource book this is insane. While this book appears to have logical sections, nothing in the sections appears in a logical order, and they seem to be merely touching the surface of each topic. There is a suggestion to be sure not to confuse two companies with similar names, and not even a hint how to do that. It appears to be more of a compilation of unrelated articles than a guide. There is more history about companies than information about the knives they made. This is a book for the ""immediately useless reference book"" shelf."
2,SCATTERED INFO,This book would benefit greatly from an index or an alphabetical format. Not enough info on fixed blades and too much on folders. If you are new to collecting check out other titles before you buy.
3,Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values,The book is kind of hard to use as in you never know where to find what you are looking for. Has a lot of pictures but poor text but is still a must have.
2,So So,I'm not going to go long here. It just didn't help me much. I think it was a bit of a rip of really.
1,"Cute, but not so after baking","This were to be my ""adding sunshine"" to my lunch or breakfast treats. They don't look so after baking. I will not buy again. I am writing to Reynolds and see if they can come up with a happy face foil print."
1,Not worth a cent,I'm sorry to say that I was a total fool in believing that the quality of a book is directly proportional to its price tag. I mistakenly thought that this book would be worth its exorbitant price tag. I felt totally cheated the moment I opened it. It looked more like some amateurish marketing undergraduate's thesis. I certainly expected more from a book priced at such a high premium. Do yourself a favour - don't ever buy it.
1,CHEATED,"I am extremely sorry to mention that this book is a total disappointment. Right from the time I opened the book, I rarely found a good in depth topic. The price tag is very high(285$). It should not be more than 50bucks.It will be good on part of the publishers to return a certain amount back or they will be losing public confidence."
1,For Rich Folks Only,"If you are post IPO of an Internet start-up, you will be able to afford this book. Otherwise you po' folks need to read wired."
1,This book should go for 2 $ maximum,"While doing my prep for an Exec briefing at E-Commerce and it's impacts to the retail and services industry - I thought this book might provide some insights and new perspectives...I was left totally disapointed. Not only is the writing sort of premature, junior graders entry level on very general views, it is also disturbing by the conclusions. I hate to say it, but this book is a total rip-off and I am glad for the occasion, reading it before buying."
2,"Too much title, not enough substance","The book fails to live up to it's title. It never really discusses ""ungodly"" things, beyond the author's one-time lapse into the use of a few swear words. And the solution offered is, of course, ""repentance, pray for forgiveness and sin no more"". In our complex times I'm afraid this won't make a dent in most of our horrors. The author missed a fine opportunity to assuage some of the many ills that beset today's society."
3,When Godly People do Ungodly things,"I haven't read the book yet, but I was a little disappointed that it was a hard cover. Guess I'll forego the pain, and get my cramps, though. I've been told it's an amazing book..."
1,This is not God's order.,"This book talks about the running for Satan, but supports anarchy, Satan's order and fear, not God's order. Just answer me this one question, Did Jesus do the right thing by dieing on the cross?"
1,disappointed,"did not receive what i ordered, ordered what the picture looked like a dallas cowboy golf cart back, recieved a golf stand bag, for all the golfers out there they will know big!!!!!!!!!! difference."
3,The way it may have been,"This book provides a very vivid picture of how the events may have unfolded around the time of Moses's birth. It is nice to be able to understand the characters and how they may have acted and felt. At its best, this tale is both informative and moving.However, this is not a piece of great literature. The story is, sometimes painfully, contrived and trite. The repetition of phrases like ""fine linen"" and awkwardly used flashbacks quickly become grating.The story of Puah is compelling, but the telling of it is not. Despite its weakness, this is still a good read for those who want new insight into a very familiar story."
4,A pleasure to read,"I heard about this book on the Dr. Laura radio show. In fact, I won it as part of an email contest. I read it in two days, stealing time from my busy life to read it whenever I could. It was a very enjoyable book to read - makes you realize there are real people, emotions, etc. behind the stories in the bible. I have known some of the story of Moses' birth since I was a child but this put it into a much more realistic perspective. Someone else's review mentioned that there was a trilogy planned - I hope so!"
3,a change of pace,"Nice little book with an unusual background setting for Roberts. The tennis is what attracted me to it. It had enough twists to keep me interested. Not her best effort, but a nice light read."
3,It was okay; liked some of her books more.,"It was okay; liked some of her books more. Some of her other books got me to read them in moments, or so it felt. This one was okay and better than most, but still not as good as some of her other books."
2,Opposites Attract,"After purchasing a few of these inter-mix books, I will be much more careful about my selections. I love Nora Roberts, but these books have no quality writing in them. I feel like I was deceived and wasted my money."
2,Opposites Attract,"I could not get interested in this story, I did not finish it, I may at sometime later, but it just didn't grab me, sorry."
1,Dissappointing,"I was very dissapointed with this book. I love Nora Roberts, but this is one book I wish I hadn't wasted money or time on... Couldn't get past the first chapter."
3,"Enjoyable but typical romance, bogged down by secrets, lies, misunderstandings, and villians.","The conflict that come between these protagonists, interfering with their ability to stay together, has been told in various ways in thousands of other romance novels.What sets this story apart from the others is the sports backdrop, injecting much needed action, color and competitiveness to an otherwise basic, dime-a-dozen plot. Throw in exciting venues such as Rome, Paris, London, Australia and New York, viewed through beautifully detailed descriptions which Nora Roberts is famous for, and the story really comes alive off the pages! It's always a rare treasure to find one of her earliest novels."
5,Finally,"Thank you to the director. Finally someone is identifying the vast array of people in our generation. I'm sick of being stereotyped by my age. Not all of us are the ""me"" generation. It's truly amazing what we as a whole have contributed to society and left behind!"
1,Beware....,"We gave it only 1 star, but we didn't even play the game. It seemed to install just fine but when we tried to run it we kept getting an error message to insert the proper CD and run the program again. We installed the online patch to no avail. After a long internet search and consulting with a computer gaming savvy coworker we discovered that this disk was most likely a bootleg copy and Windows would not allow it to run because it could not pass the copywrite screen upon launch. Thankfully Amazon allowed us to return it without an issue. Thank you, Amazon!"
5,Finally! A wholistic approach to helping kids,"I was thinking about sending my daughter to one of those weight camps and now I am not going to do it. Instead, we are trying to do the things Dr. Linda suggests. So far, it's working. My son doesn't like the limit on video games but I now realize, I'm in charge and doing what's best for him. This book got me thinking about lifestyle changes, not just weight.The wholistic approach makes more sense than faddish diets."
3,Overweight Kids,"This is a good book to read about how to turn-around unhealthy eating habits that cause excessive weight in kids. Of course, the same principles also apply to adults, so this book need not be restricted to teens. Dr. Mintle has had many years of experience treating overweight kids, but the book is not a psychotherapy regimen for professionals. It is a self-help, step-by-step approach that anyone can apply. My only objection is that Dr. Mintle inserts her religious beliefs here and there, and while not excessive, can turn off people not so inclined."
4,BLACK MAN'S IDEA FROM CALI,This Album Is strictly for old school G's If y'all new age punk aint down with OG's you need to get a clue cuzzz. Anyways This Album comes from the heart Of gangster Rap
5,amazingly insightful and infinitely engaging,"This wonderful work has been indispensible in my research into collections and souvenirs. Stewart's ability to look at the long history of visual culture and bring in such disparate elements as Pop art and miniature manuscripts makes for a thoughtful and reasoned argument. Particularly notable is her need to cross barriers of medium, writing on everything from children's stories to painting to Tom Thumb weddings. An engaging read that rarely falls victim to theoretical rhetoric. The world needs more writers like Stewart who take their time, slowly unfolding their argument, surveying all aspects of culture, giving high and low culture equal weight."
4,Very usefull for research,"This book has some truly enlightening chapters on the meaning and implications of Souvenirs, which are really useful in conceptual research. I haven't read the whole thing though."
5,a great book for artists,On Longing is sensitively written and a must read for anyone interested in art or literature especially artists and writers. I would recommend Italo Calvino's Six Memos for the Next Millenium to anyone who enjoyed On Longing.
3,Tiny,The caddy is hard to pick up with flatware in it. The handle is hard to reach. It's a lot smaller than I thought it would be -- I was expecting one the size of the old wooden caddy I have.
2,Let Down,"FFM is the only book of its kind, which makes it seem better than it really is. Written by a cardiac surgeon (whose physical training experience is obviously limited), the books exhibits exercises which are higher in risk and lower in effectiveness than alternative movements. Books like this that show which exercises to perform, but don't tell you all of the important details about how to safely and effectively perform those exercises are all but worthless. The production quality of this book is poor - several photos are straight up BLURY. There is no excuse to include these photos in a professional product. The information provided is the same general knowledge that is available in most reputable fitness books. I was looking for something more pertinent to motor racing and this book does not deliver."
4,"intelligent, provocative","A book with ideas that can give you something constructive to think about. It helps also to read the updated revision,21st Century Science and Health with Key to the Scriptureswhich includes current terminology and modern scientific discoveries. The thoughts in ""Science and Health"" are definitely Christian, however, by default, include a spiritual interpretation of all ""Scripture"" because Christ, Truth, embraces all people and creation."
2,Feeble,"As a fan of these three eras in fashion, I had high hopes for this book, but the front cover is the best thing about it. The most grievous problem with this book is that, focussing as it does on such a limited time span, it should go into depth about that time span. It does not. The descriptions of fashions of the eras are too generalized and don't indicate how and when changes within the eras took place; since fashion was changing pretty rapidly by the end of the 19th century, and certainly by the beginning of the 20th, I expected much more attention to chronology and gradual changes.The illustrations are also scanty and often of poor quality; some look as though they were made by tracing the outline of another illustration. I could have forgiven the shortcomings of the text had this book provided lots of illustrations, which is the main reason I suspect many of us buy books on fashion history. This book has a great premise, but it is very unhelpful."
2,"a ""don't buy""","I had read several encouraging reviews and decided to purchase this book; and unfortunately, I feel that I wasted my money.On the plus side, while the author says nothing new, she does a good job of going over social and fashion trends of the time; I will give her credit for a decent job of writing and research.But for me, as for other vintage fashion enthusiasts, any book on historical garments must include lots, and I mean lots, of great illustrations, whether photographs or reprints from contemporary periodicals and catalogs. This is where ""Victorian to Vamp"" falls disappointingly short.The reprints are of indifferent quality, a couple of them quite crude (the author couldn't get her hands on a better picture of Amelia Jenks Bloomer? Come on!). And for a book of this type, why oh why couldn't the editors have sprung for a couple of prints in color?If the author would care to reissue this with the help of a better photo/print researcher, I might be tempted to revise my opinion."
2,A Couple of Good Songs,There's only 2 good songs on this CD - Love For a Lifetime and China Rain. I purchased this CD after purchasing his other CD - Smooth Summer. The Smooth Summer CD is much better. If you happen to see the Smooth Summer Cd in some used CD place check it out.
1,where's the Celitc?,"I was looking forward to an album of the Mass in Celtic stylings. Instead what I got was a few strategically placed selections with 'pipes, and a lot of English opratic singers who put forth wonderfully the stodgy British style of overpowering the main work. I would have perfered it if the composer had chosen some of the current Celtic artists (Maire Brennan, Anuna, Joanne Hogg, Altan, etc.)or chosen singers in this style, who could have interpreted the Welsh, Scots and Irish texts more faithfully. As it was, in my opinion, there is nothing here for fans of Celtic music. (I gave it one star because the opening theme with the Uilleann Pipes is simply beautiful -- too bad the rest of the album did not carry through with this style.)"
5,If you love Jell-o (and retro recipes) this is for you!,"This book is great. It has all of the classic Jell-o recipes you remember from when you were a kid, like Under-the-Sea salad, rainbow molds, ribbon salad. The book also has more modern recipes for the more recently developed ""sparkling"" jell-o. Great color photos throughout the book.Jell-o desserts had fallen out of fashion over the last few years, but with the retro food craze, I think we will see a revival. This book is a great place to start. My only complaint is that I wish there were more recipes."
2,Novel Interpretation of Jesus and His Kingdom!,"Unhappy with the way Jesus is commonly understood, Schweitzer presents his radical reinterpretation of Jesus' life and teaching on the kingdom. Schweitzer sees the ""mystery of the Kingdom"" as Jesus' development of the thought of the prophets to present an ""interim ethic"" that not only anticipates the future arrival of the kingdom but actually brings it about.I'll add that, though I have a master's degree in theology, for the most part I found myself completely unable to understand what Schweitzer was talking about. Reader beware."
2,Vic Firth Jazz Rakes: they would be okay if they were two dollars a piece... disposable!,"Vic Firth Jazz RakesGreat sound for the music I do (soft jazzy rock)... but very poor contruction. I had a pair for a few months and they are almost gone. The soft rubber where the handle meets the bristles has cracked on both brushes and I've already lost a few bristles. If you consider that I've used these brushes sparingly and on congas, bongos and cymbals (on ""soft"" stuff that is, with no nasty rims to contend with), it is obvious that this product needs to be better manufactured. Let me guess... built in China?"
4,Much Valuable Information,"Compared to the Mountain of Silence this sequel doesn't quite measure up simply because it contains much more travelogue and interjections by the author. The conversations with 'Fr. Maximos' are still wonderful, you just have to wade through a couple of slow chapters. Overall it is still an enjoyable introduction to Orthodox spirituality."
2,One cut does not an album make,"I heard a cut by this artist on Sirius Radio and then ordered one of his CD's. He plays beautifully, but the songs themselves are by and large ho-hum. I don't know if he wrote them all or not, but better song material would be my wish."
4,Hydrogenation of Fats and Oils : Theory and Practice,As I have been informed for an expert in hydrogenation is the best book for any that work in such productive process.
1,Arrogant authors,"While this text is factual, it reads like a novel - sensational and wordy. I love history, but this book was flat and irritating. I can't believe high-schoolers are reading this. I'm over 30 and have a PhD, and struggled through parts of it. I should note my struggles in this book came from confusing text. I felt the authors were trying so hard to ""sound"" intelligent that they ended up saying nothing. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this. It's a shame that authors like this continue to write such trash, destroying history and publishing. If you are forced to or want to read this be warned: it is written in overly formal English."
3,Ca marche!,"I'm using it right now for French 201. The only drawback is that it has a french/english dictionary in the back and not an english/french like the previous book. I think the authors presume that we shouldn't be using english at all (or minimally). Even so, it would come in handy for those of us still struggling with vocabulary. Merci!"
4,Helpful intermediate level book,"Good book. My copy was used and slightly tattered, but the book is great."
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT,I have been to 3 Litfiba's concerts and I know almost every single song. In my opinion El Diablo is the most beautiful album of their career so far. Grandi Piero e Ghigo (ma e' vero che il Ghigo non fa piu' parte dei Litfiba????)
3,Adoption Option,"This book was very informative; however, most of the book lists adoption agencies in all 52 states. While this is helpful, it is almost the entire book. This book is not a one-stop adoption resource book. The book should go more indept as to the different steps involved. For instance, the book mentions home study; however, there is no mention as to what exactly is a home study. What are they looking for, what kind of questions do they ask, etc. I think this book is worth buying, because it does have a lot of information in it, but you will need to buy other books as well."
3,Disappointed,"While the book touched on the highlights of requirements for adoption, I was disappointed that it did not go into further depth of the entire process. The majority of the book consisted of listings of certain requirements of agencies throughout the U.S. I was hoping for a little more guidance through the process."
1,Not the only book with adoption professionals info,"I am an avid reader of adoption books and this title is not the only book that has adoption professional info as Ms. Adamec states. There are others on the market in which cover all types of adoption professionals-agencies, attorneys, facilitators, counselors, consultants, adoption-service providers, etc."
4,Excellent NYC Garage music,"Two CD collection of late 90's NYC House music by Kenny Dope & Louie Vega. My preference is Louie Vega's CD, because it is more Latin flavored. This is part of my permanent House music collection."
3,This movie could have been better with Christopher Lee,"I miss Christopher Lee as the role of Dracula.I hope for a comeback.But Rudger Hauer plays Dracula good as well.""Dracula II-Ascension"" was a pretty bad movie,but this is better.The movie dos not include human-bats or creatures like ""Van Helsing"" (2004) and ""Dracula"" (1992).This is more ""down to earth"" story.The story is set in 2005.If you are a Dracula-fan,i recomand this."
2,To everything an end,"The series wasn't particularely high quality, but for some reason one keeps watching until the end. And what a lovely ending it is.I had the most trouble with the changing of actors during the three movies. Was it so hard to keep them or did they use them up during the process? Not a clue.Perhaps I'm a bit spoiled, but I prefer grande productions in high quality such as the Bram Stoker's version."
2,FANGS FOR NOTHING,"The initial entry in this Wes Craven-produced trilogy boasted a fine performance from Gerard Butler as the bloody count. The following to sequels (2 and 3 were filmed at the same time and cut into two movies) fall amazing flat. This time around, Jason Scott Lee returns as the fearless vampire killer, aided by the expected ""dorky"" associate, played with little aplumb by Jason London. Roy Scheider has a cameo as the wisened older priest and Rutger Hauer returns briefly as the nefarious count. In between, we have some kind of plot focusing on Rumanian rebels and the quest to find London's girlfriend who the count absconded with in the second movie. The vampire scenes are cliched, the plot is thickened with nonsensical diversions and the acting subpar. Hopefully this will end this misguided attempt to resurrect a tired old vampire."
1,WHAT'S THIS CRAP!,"The sets are slopply done, Dracula's throne room looks like a Circuit City going out of business sale. AND DAWM! couldn't they have found a better person to play Dracula, Rutger Hauer is far too DAWM FAT. Who the HELL wants to see a big beer gut Dracula with Gray Stubble all over his face. Enough is enough, the Vampire King doesn't deserve to be treated this way."
3,Fine Resolution,"The third in the Dracula 2000 trilogy, but mostly the end of the second movie in the series. The storyline continues as the vampire slayers make their way across Romania, fighting vampires, rebels and criminals selling people for food.Viewers who are vampire fans will find this movie entertaining. Non-vampire fans will find this less entertaining. The acting was pretty good considering this is a direct to DVD offering.There are a couple of short interviews and a good commentary with the DVD.Overall, I would actually give this a 3.5 stars, and with the ending, felt satisfied with the resolution. In fact, I would be up for a Dracula 4."
1,Everything is there except the direction.,"The story has potential, the make up is okay, the sets look too clean and plastic, though they could easily be made better. The actors could probably act better if they were directed better.The whole thing doesn't come alive, or together. Each part remains a part, separate and inanimate. You need to see a movie like this one to understand why the good movies are good.Sorry for the director, but to moviegoers: don't waste your time on this one, it's a flop."
1,Warranty only 3 months,"Beware of the warranty. Ours had a defect that manifested under certain conditions. However, the labor warranty expires after 3 months so they wanted $200 plus 2-way shipping to repair their defect! We barely had the thing out of the box at 3 months."
3,Well at least it does nice movies,"I got this item as a gift.I makes really nice movies and I thought I could get rid of my old digital camera as well but....This thing takes miserable still photos. Not even fit for printing. I have a three year old coolpix 3200 that takes much better photos but bad videos. So I get stuck taking them both with me to events. So if you need a camcorder that takes good digital photos just keep looking.Panasonic avg digital picture size 111,587 Bytes on highest resolutionMy old coolpix digital photos size 1,097,728 Bytes on medium resolutionYou do the math"
1,can't get i-link to work,"apparently, the firewire connection only works with Mac computers. at least, the user manual has detailed instructions for connecting to a Mac, but nothing for PC. Not only that, you have to download drivers to make the USB connection work. this camcorder is useless to me."
5,This bell is the best!,"My son recieved this as a gift when he was about 4 months old, and it didn't take long before he was able to grab the top of the bell and shake it around. He loves being the person responsible for the ringing noise. The bell's got a great sound, and no sharp edges to poke little fingers. I love it."
4,A great toy - but do not expect a certain color(s),"I bought 2 of these bells and received them today. I knew that the colors would vary and had no problem getting any assortment of colors for my daughter. I was pretty disappointment when I opened my package to receive two bells the exact same color (orange with yellow handle). I kind of feel I got stuck with the least popular colors! I wish the person who put the shipment together would have given the order a little extra thought and put 2 different colored bells in. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 for this reason.Otherwise, the bells are very well made and make a pleasant jingle. My 9 month old daughter immediately became excited and laughed when she took the bell and shook it. I can see this toy transitioning from baby, to toddler, to young child."
5,Perfect!,"I use this tied to a string on our door, and our dog rings it when he needs to go out to pee. I used to use a regular jingle bell til I had kids, and this ended up being the perfect solution with a crawling baby in the house. Everyone is injury free and it's incredibly durable!"
4,pretty cool,"I bought this under the impression (for some reason) that it was a pack of 2 or 4, so when i only got 1 i was a little bummed. I know this was my own mistake, but I do wish it came with at least 2! they are pretty cool, my 13 month old likes it, it has a nice sound and its bigger then i expected which is nice!"
4,Bell toy,"Very fun for little ones, infants, toddlers and children. Great for sensory stim programming. Kiddos love bells and this one is safe as the little bells are encased in the plastic case."
2,"Sorry, i thought there should have three, instead of one.","The bell itself is lovely, and my 7-month old daughter loves it. BUT, how come the picture shows three instead of one on Amazon? I belive that i'm not the only one who questioned at this. Why not change the picture right now??"
3,AHHHHHHH!!!!! ONLY ONE!!!! WHAT A SORPRAISE!!!!!,WHEN I GOT THIS BELL I TOUGH I WAS PAYING FOR THREE BUT IS ONLY ONEONLY 1 WUA PLEASE READ VERY CAREFULLY =(
1,BEWARE: You only get ONE bell for this price not THREE,"I purchased this because I was under the impression that there were three bells in a set. Given the three bells in the photo, can you blame me? I suppose ti should have read the fine print. The title does afterall state ""Bell"" not ""Bells"". Oh well...I will definitely be sending this back. I cannot justify spending this money on one bell."
1,only one bell??????,"Like the others, I thought that for $10.95 I was getting 3 bells - pretty embarrassed when i sent this as a gift! Although its nice and easy to handle, I wouldnt think of paying over $30 for 3 of these!"
1,buyer beware only get one not three,"Toy is fine but not happy with price and picture expected three not one. Buyer beware look at description carefully the picture of three are misleading. There are other ways to let a buyer know that more than one color is available. The buyer is not given a color choice you just get whatever color they send you. Like mine was none of the colors pictured. Nice toy just feel betrayed by a sneaky seller. I look for this type of thing on ebay now I guess I will have to on here as well. ""Single cage bell"" I interpreted as one bell in the cage not only one of what was pictured. BOO"
1,ONLY 1,"The listing is really misleading. It appears that you are receiving three, but you only receive one. Guess that's what I get for not reading the fine print! $10 for ONE bell....NOT WORTH IT!!!"
3,Good quality toy,"I bought two bells as Christmas gifts this year, one for a boy and one for a girl. The toys are very good quality but my score of a 3 comes from the color- they were both pink and purple. I was not too thrilled to give this to the boy."
3,only ONE bell,"Although the picture shows 3 bells, you only get ONE bell. It's a good bell, but the price is steep for just ONE bell. Also very poorly packaged; I'm surprised it didn't fall out in the mail."
4,great infant toy,We bought this for my daughter at 6 months. She loves to chew on the handle and shake it around. The bell sound is pleasant (and I am easily annoyed by sounds). Only 4 stars due to the steep price.
3,a little heavy and a little boring,my ten month old rattled it around for a bit but she got bored of it pretty quick. i noticed it is a little heavy so it might be tiring to play with it for long. it seems very durable. i will keep it for when she is a bit older.
1,You have got to be kidding!,"I started to read this 1200-page book on the recommendation of my psychoanalyst. I was lost by the middle of page 2, and gave up entirely at page 17. It's a wonder I made it that far. Reading this book was like swimming upside down in a vat of peanut oil. Everything seems like it's inverted and moving in slow motion. Most of the time I wasn't even sure who was talking. I really want to meet the person who has read this book all the way to the end. He/she probably also competes in ""iron man"" triathalons and peruses the tax code for pleasure. Not my cup of tea!"
1,Miss Macintosh My Darling,"I had a tough time plowing through this book. In fact, I didn't. It was impenetrable. There was almost no dialog and nothing much seemed to happen. Since I couldn't make any headway at the beginning, I tried starting at various places throughout the book. I couldn't get anywhere. My eyes glazed over. I suppose that means it is a great work beyond my comprehension."
3,Print is to small....,The book is good and it has a lot of good information but if you have a hard time seeing I would recammend larger print.
2,"children's books LISTED, not pictured","As far as teaching art concepts, principles, elements, style, this is a good book.BUT...I thought this book would include picture examples from the ""more than 20 Caldecott... books"" mentioned. The way the synopsis on the back of the book reads ""Using more then 100 illustrations and award winning children's books..."" is technically correct. There are pictures & there are books, the pictures are just not OF or FROM the books. All the pictures were ""created by the author""(p.xvi). The books are included in each chapter as ""Children's Literature Examples"" and given in a sort of bibliography type format. ""Famous...books...are listed. Finding examples can be frustrating...Don't spend a lot of time on it..."" (p.xv).Perhaps this was meant to foster trips to the library, but I am still dissapointed."
5,Teaching Art with Style,Teaching Art with Books Kids Love presents the elements of art in a way that engages students and is clear enough for the 'artistically challenged' classroom teacher to follow! The project directions and examples are excellent. This is a great find for teachers who want to present a quality art program.
3,an interesting mix,"Wayfaring Strangers draws from a wide range of traditions, mainly bluegrass and jazz, as well as klezmer, to create a very well-crafted album. Unfortunately, this sometimes contributes to a labored feel on some of the songs, including the title track. But the CD has some great moments as well, especially the soulful ""Who'll Sing for Me?"" All three vocalists are top-notch, as well. The Wayfaring Strangers bring a lot to the bluegrass table, and the album should be commended."
5,EXCELLENT!!!! Aoife O'Donovan is superb! Great harmonies too,"This CD is incredible. It has a jazz beat with bluegrass harmony - an amazing mesh of musical styles. I would love to see these same three ladies stick around for a third album. Also, it would be great if the toured more frequently."
2,Not Quite Anything,"I was drawn to a passage of the 7+ min ""Cluck Old Hen"" which has some fine jazzgrasswork. I bought the CD and was very disappointed. Not Bluegrass, not Jazz, not Folkand IMO not very inspiring. Very well recorded. If your not a fan of true Bluegrass,Jazz or Folk then you may enjoy this. ~JDH~"
2,Watch The Other One,"I watched the first five minutes. A second-rate video/audio transfer. Buzzing sound on the sound track. I had just watched (the previous week) one entitled ruth Prevails: Jan Hus of Bohemia. Better video and audio quality, and the content was good. If you are going to buy just one for yourself or a church group, I recommend Truth Prevails: Jan Hus of Bohemia."
2,"Story great, but production quality disappointing","I like high production quality in movies. While this movie has a great story to tell and the scripting was adequate, I was disappointed with the directing/editing and picture quality of the movie. Most of the directing is acceptable, but there are places I felt it could have been better. The movie doesn't have a rich look and I think the DVD is taken from a VHS format because the picture is fuzzy. Other than that, the story is an important one and the movie was fairly well done."
5,John Hus,Excellent book on a man few are acquainted with. He was instrumental in the challenging of the Catholic Churches wrong teachings and was not afraid to die for the truth.
4,a little dissapointed,"ok, I think Anthrax is great I have been listening to then band since 88ish........this is a great thing they did BUT why split songs on cd and DVD??$$$....surprised they chose this tatic, though I dont like I am the manmadhouse is a classic...... hope they know fans dont like this selling tatic............."
3,KILLER DVD BUT I AM NOT IN IT MOSHING AS I HAD HOPED!,"I was at this concert and crowd surfed at LEAST 7-10 times, each time going over the barrier. On no less than 5 of these occasions I looked right at the cameras, streching my hands nearly to the roof of the place, hoping to make my acting debut on the DVD.I am nowhere to be found!!!!!!That aside, great document of a landmark show. Interesting how 14 years ago they claimed Joey was ""Not a good fit"" for them. Why all of a sudden is a he a good fit now? I wonder how John Bush feels.Above hypocrisy and my antics on the cutting room floor make this a 3 instead of a 4 or 5.... mosh on!"
2,"FOR A BUSH-ERA FAN, VERY DISSAPOINTING.","A DREAM COME TRUE FOR JOEY FANS. AS A JOHN BUSH/ANTHRAX FAN, THIS IS A HUGE STEP BACKWARDS IN THE NAME OF ECONOMICS. THE ENERGY/AGGRESSIVE APPROACH ON THE MASS DESTRUCTION DVD MAKES THIS LOOK LIKE AND OLDIES SHOW."
4,more power beads,"The box may be big, but the beads are nice, far better than the plastic or tiny glass beads in most kits. I haven't been able to find anything similar. My daughter made bracelets nice enough for her (and me) to wear. She used every bead in the box, and went back to the craft many times. I was looking for a second box for Christmas and I am sorry - but not surprised - that it is sold out."
1,Likely Zane Grey's worst book,From a confirmed Zane Grey affectionado - this is my least favorite Grey book. Don't bother.
5,Super Nice Little Book for the value,This is a super nice little book for the value.perfect for glass painting or a layout of angels.im glad I took a chance on this one.you cant go wrong.B.W.
3,"Cute, but don't feel like great quality","These are cute and do the trick, but the fabric feels a little flimsy, and the hems look like they will come apart before too long."
3,Great album that deserves a better reissue,"This is no critique of the album Bite, which is wonderful and an underrated 80s gem, but just of this reissue. I bought the original vinyl issue back in 83 and still own it, but was looking for a CD version for playing convenience as well as (hopefully) cleaner sound.As another reviewer mentioned (and which I didn't read before ordering), the second track ""Another Lost Look"" is very different from the original album version. ""Love to Stay"" is also a different edit, although the ""bonus track"" of this song is actually the album version.It's kind of surprising that the reissue makes these changes without mention, while presenting them as the originals. It's nice to have the bonus tracks, but we're left without the complete original album. Guess I'll have to play the vinyl until I can find a copy of the Japanese CD which simply has the original eight tracks."
5,More fun than a barrel of monkeys!,"Great for the beginner. really takes you through everything from soup to nuts in building and trimming a hand launch glider. I really like the trimming part because the book takes you through a systematic process by which you balance, trim and successfully fly your first glider. Outstanding."
2,Poor quality recording,"Firstly let me say that I did not buy this product from Amazon, but from a different supplier. Just thought I'd share my experience here in case it helps someone else.Although this is a beautiful movie, I'm awarding it 2 stars because of the very poor quality of the recording, and only because of that.It almost looks like the movie was re-recorded with a handheld camera, before it was written to DVD.The sound quality is poor, as is the video quality. And when titles appear on screen, you can actually see the text moving around / floating. To me, a sure indication that this DVD wasn't printed from the original film.I've contacted Arrowfilms for comment (the distributor), but haven't heard back yet. I'll try to update this review once/if I do.There does seem to be different prints available of Indochine DVD. Maybe the others offer better quality.For a movie that promises so much in terms of the audio-visual experience, I cannot recommend this version of the DVD."
4,A sweeping epic - the story of France's withdrawal from Indochina,"You can see why ""Indochine"" won an Academy Award (Best Foreign Picture). It's one of those sweeping epics (no other word can describe it) that Hollywood loves. Catherine Deneuve is fantastic here. Fourteen years after its theatrical release, ""Indochine"" is still well worth putting on your ""gotta see"" list.Here's a connection I loved discovering: Linh Dan Pham - who plays Deneuve's adopted daughter Camille here - is (12 years later on) the same actress who portrays piano virtuoso 'Miao Lin' in Jacques Audiard's brilliant ""The Beat that My Heart Skipped."""
4,A beautiful tale in a beautiful and unknown Vietnam.,I found the story and the sceneries of South Asia so beautiful that they haunted my dreams for a while! This movie at least shows a unknown and beautiful vietnam that we didn't expect to see. The actors are great. I forgot: is this a true story?
5,"5 Star movie, 5 Star service","5 Star movie, 5 Star service i love this movie beautiful boats, beautiful women, historical, wonderful cinematography, affirmation of my political opinions about vietnam. groovy in every respect!!"
4,movie,While this movie is very long (needed some editing) overall it is an intriguing picture of colonial life in pre-communist Vietnam. It takes place during the 1950's and gives a prelude to the disasterous effect of communism to that region of the world.
4,A mother-daughter relationship amidst political tumult,"Catherine Deneuve plays a French planatation owner (Eliane) in colonial Vietnam whose relationship with the Vietnamese orphan girl (Camille) she adopted seems intended to allegorically mirror the political shift also depicted in the movie from a French colonial Vietnam to a nation struggling for liberation and identity. Superbly filmed and accompanied by a lush musical score, the film shows some stunning shots of the Vietnamese landscape particularly as Camille journeys through Vietnam after she flees her home. The movie is long (about 2 1/2 hours), and at times the emotions may seem played over the top. But Catherine Deneuve hits a poignant emotional climax towards the end of the movie, outside of the conference site of the Vietnam War peace talks in Paris. Well worth the over two hour wait."
1,bad copy and can'y play movie,"bad copy and can't play this movie....not professional ! my first bad experience, be my first time to buy something from this vendor and I am not sure I can trust"
2,Exotic soap opera,"This is a soap opera set in exotic Indo-China under the French rule. The plot goes on and on, with quite a few touches of melodrama. The only outstanding feature is the amazing re-creation of the period and location, and the marvelous photography."
1,DVD did not function on any computers drives or on DVD players.,DVD did not function in modern DVD player or in the computer drive. Only the title page displayed. Returned same and received a refund.Indochine
2,Indochine,"THE DVD WAS RECEIVED ON TIME, BUT THE DISC CAME LOOSE INSIDE OF THE CASE AND THE DVD WAS DAMAGED JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE.THE MOVIE IS 5 STARS BUT THE DISC [DVD] ONLY 1/2 STARSRMM"
2,Check for pulse!,"I thought most all of the cast was on airplane glue. Ms Deneuve's clothes were nice and the scenery--endless feet of film worth--was nice. Everytime I check out one of the foreign films cited as ""best"", I should remember to take a nap before viewing. Anyone who would leave home for Mr. Lopez and travel a kajillion miles, starve in a prison and become a commie as a result, must have lived a very sheltered life. I mean the guy Deneuve's daughter was to supposed to marry in the first place had more fire and imagination. Maybe Catherine wasn't the only one doin' opium!"
4,Blindness in a beautiful land,"This is an absolutly stunning film with a equal cast. Nearly every veteran or visitor to Vietnam tell me the same thing about the remarkable beauty of the land. This film tells as others have in other ways in other locations how good meaning wealthy landlords thinking the are themselves now as ""native"" as the natives only hasten the end. The blindness in the eyes of s Deneuve's character isn't much different tothe blindness of what one sees in the plantation owners of El Salvador thinking giving their peasents homes and cristmas gifts."
3,a culture dies very very veeeeerrrrry sloooooowly ...,"set in vietnam in the waning days of the french empire, one might want to see this as a companion piece to renoir films. then again, one might not. good acting, nice pictures, vincent perez is pretty, mostly overblown."
5,Background to history,"If this film didn't do anything else, it updates Americans on the background history in French Indochina up to the time when the United States decided to try its hand in pushing the Communists back and regaining control of Vietnam. It is a great help in understanding how the U.S. got there and why we weren't anymore successful than France was in subduing the Communist insuragency.Besides this the viewer gets a wonderful film, well acted by Cantherine Deneuve, getting better all the time, and Vincent Perez as well a large group of other well known French and Vietnamese actors.Wonderful film, good acting, great intriguing story. What more do you want from a film."
4,A Little Something For Everyone,"Indochine is the epic tale of French and Vietnamese sailors, lovers and revolutionaries in colonial Southeast Asia at the dawn of the Vietnam War. It contains plenty of twists and turns, sufficient action and a fascinating historical background. I even talked friends of mine who did not understand French into watching it with me and they loved it, in spite of their having to read subtitles!"
4,Gorgeous and tragic,"Perfectly cast Catherine Deneuve plays a wealthy French woman born and raised in Indochina prior to the Communist takeover of what becomes Vietnam in 1955. She has adopted a native girl as her daughter, and the tragedy begins to play itself out as the child grows up and becomes part of the revolution.Lushly filmed, giving a realistic picture of Hanoi and the countryside before decades of war and destruction decimated Vietnam."
5,THE OPERA OF THE FILM,"Last night I had a chance to watch this movie again. Somehow, for the first time, I felt as it was an opera. Music was there, the voices were there, the theme was there and everything was so perfect as an Italian opera of the greatest composer. I took my time, I really did, to find anything wrong with this film and I could not. Now, let me tell you that I am a picky one. I can take apart anything if I don't like it and sometimes if I like it. But this one was so bulletproof that I faild to find the whole in it.So, I guess, ""Indocine"" is one of very rare accasions in the cinematography when everything is perfect. How did they do it? I guess they just lived it. Well, if you have not seen it, you have to do it. This is not a movie to miss."
5,ahhh the back,"This is a sensuous, rich, passionate story about a family and their travails in Asia (Viet Nam or Cambodia, somewhere with rubber plantations) before the foreigners came to change it. A mother who can't resist discreet affairs with young, beautiful men is horrified when her daughter falls for the man she loves. The daugter runs away, breaking her mother's heart and her own.Catherine Deneuve is absolutely stunning-- I will always remember the scene of her dancing with her daughter at the party and her removing her jacket and there is her back -- wow. Her daughter is magnificent and don't know why we've not heard of her again with adulation."
5,Pure class,"The best work of Deneuve EVER!,a story that will surprise everyone,very nicely done. a MUST see in French cinematography.from ALTEREGO in Tulsa Oklahoma"
4,An American Darling,"Russell Banks's devastating story of an American woman, Hannah Musgrave, whose radical activities eventually lead her to settle in Liberia during its turbulent civil war, is a tale well-told by Mary Beth Hurt in this unabridged CD set. As narrator, Hurt maintains a steady, forward moving pace that matches the protagonist's increasingly tense situation. She does a fine job of recreating each character's individual voice, her only misstep being the unpleasant gutteral tone she assigns to one of Hannah's fellow radicals. The tale is consistently compelling inspite of the protagonist's impenetrable aloofness. You may forget Hannah, but you cannot forget Liberia."
2,Unbelievable,The main character was not likable and unbelievable. I could tolerate an unlikable character but the story and character were too abnormal. The story relied too much on coincidence and undeveloped plot. Thoughout the book the actions of Hannah rely heavily on her avoidance from the FBI. But the fact that the FBI is after her and the fit with her personality is very weak. The Zack character turns up whenever they need a backup for a new twist. All her money to come to America is used to buy a ticket and escape for Charles Taylor (or so the books quotes) but yet she continues to live with the same money and even manages to buy a video camera and return ticket to Africa. The whole plot is just too far fetched.The only redeeming quality and it is just a small percent of the book is the historic setting in Liberia.
5,"Haunting, Thought Provoking, Maddening...","I recently listened to the audio version of this book and can't stop thinking about it. Hannah Musgrave is absolutely one of the most maddening, yet unforgetable, characters I have ever encountered. She can be selfish or stupid and yet remains sympathetic to some degree. Her story is fascinating. How does a privileged white woman come to have a husband and three sons in Africa that she's abandoned, yet can't totally write off? Russell Banks is an outstanding author. My first exposure to him was the movie, ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and I found correlations in the stories, even though their subjects and locations were vastly different. This is a great story, which progresses nicely and leaves enough suspense that you will want to see it through, even if you don't love all the characters."
4,The Darling,"This is the second time I read the book because years ago it left me haunted, to reexamine the relationships. I recommended this to my bookclub and most of them hated it., because they hated the idea that a woman could be so selfish that she could leave everything behind including her children without remorse."
3,"Incredibly fascinating, profoundly disappointing","As a woman who can identify conceptually with Hannah Musgrave's ideals (and some of the locales of her tale), I found the individual components of her story fascinating. However, the pieces fail to come together coherently. We hear (I listened to the audio book) the story of her past, but never really grasp how she comes to cope with her present. The timing of her final return to America and it's impact is not given proper attention."
1,Barely Finished It!,"Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks. I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine. She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know? Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the ""sixties"" -- was contrived and unreal. I was immensely disappointed."
2,"Some good, some bad","Some interesting historical content about Liberia, otherwise I probably would not have forced myself to read the entire book."
3,Interesting,"This is the first book I read by Banks. I found the subject matter really interesting. It provides a great insight into a topic that is quite obscure for most of us - underground ""terrorists"" in the US, African politics etc. Like other reviewers I found Hannah to be self absorbed and completely unable to do anything that is not for her own benefit. I did not feel sorry for her most of the time and found it hard to understand her reasoning. Overall it was a very interesting and well written book, but the heroine really lets it down."
5,A Gripping Tale of Africa,"Once started, I could not put this book down and flew through it in a few days of spare-time reading. Written in the first person by the character Hannah, it is both an engrossing study of an extremely complex personality (her) as well as a mini-education in the history of Liberia. The character of Hannah is not a likeable one but I found her story to be facinating, and, unfortunately perhaps, I did see some of my own detachment from relationships reflected in hers. This is not a book for the faint of heart as it contains some explicit sexual situations as well as graphic violence. This was the first book I have read by this author and it certainly has sparked my interest in reading more of his books."
2,they can do better,"i thought this game was quite bad compared to what 989 usually produces. i have seen much betted games that this out on the market such as fifa 2001, tony hawk pro skater 2. and quite frankley this game was horribble, if you want a good game get nhl 2001"
1,The worst one yet,"I recently played NHL Faceoff 2001, and was sadly disappointed by what I saw. The gameplay is basically the same, and the season option isn't worth anything. One season? What can you do in just one season. Like I said, the gameplay is basically the same , but unfortunately not improved. trading players is nearly impossible, and once you do figuer out the puzzle, the other team opposes it most of the time. If you want to play a REAL hockey game, try NHL 2001."
3,"989 Studios shoots, OH, it hits the post...","Gee, it's Hockey time already... time to watch the greats and play as them with your favorite game; Bure, Roy, Demitra, Hull... and in this game, they are done NO justice.The game itself is fine... for FaceOff 2000. IT'S THE SAME GAME!!! You would THINK that for probably the last PlayStation hockey game by 989, they'd go all out. Nope. Same graphics, same modes, same horrible commentary. I agree, it's a good game, but could EASILY have been improved upon. The controls, camera, AI, everything's the same as last year; which is not necessarily bad, it's just not good enough to call iteslf a sequel.RATINGS: out of 5Graphics: 4.5- good, but outdated as well. NHL 2001 blows this one away. Sound: 0.5- this kills the game. Somebody, shut the announcers up!! Control: 4.8- very tight and responsive; the best part of the game. Fun-ocity: 4- the anouncing and few improvements still don't outweigh the fun.OVERALL: 3 Stars. for die-hard fans only."
1,RIP OFF,"Amazon Charges about over $120 for this Subscription than directly ordering from FHM.com But , I do love this over Maxim since Maxim UK Edition has been canceled. I like ""British"" magazines better because United States Magazine are very prudish just like our TV Networks & Magazines. The one star is for the price Amazon charges alone."
1,New Booda Bone Formula Not Durable,"I had the same experience with the Booda Bones. My 16 lb Chinese Crested PowderPuff can also get through them in 15 minutes, and that's the ""biggest"" size, which is intended for 55 lbs or over!!! Disappointed."
5,Fantastic CD,"I has the pleasure of seeing J Mark McVey perform in Les Miserables on Broadway this December 2002. When he sang ""Bring Him Home"", it literally moved me to tears. I needed to hear more from this excellent performer. I can safely say every selection on his CD, Broadway and Beyond, is a winner. He has a pure and powerful voice. I can also hear his love of performing in every selection, and have thoroughly enjoyed his CD."
5,McVey is AMAZING!!!,"I just saw Le Miz, last performance in LA, but the tour is continuing around the country. McVey played the lead role (Jean Valjean); he was amazing! What a beautiful voice, best I've ever heard (the audience was thrilled). The entire cast is really good and the play is a must see for anyone who likes Broadway style musicals. I am ordering this CD so I can hear McVey again and will update this post once I get the CD, but I don't see how I can go wrong!"
4,Tasty but a little salty.,"Found this item to be very tasty but with the high salt taste level I had a hard time finding alot of uses for it, mac n cheese wasgreat and adding to zuchinni was great, just need more ideas for it."
5,Very good for initial signing of the essential word that baby can use to communicate,Video is simple and has good repetition which is good for children catch on quickly. When toddlers start to talk and it is all gobbley gook it is easier to understand and communicate when they sign their words as well. I greatly recommend
5,Excellent video,"My daughter loves this video...that's all she watches right now...it's very nice and slow with classical music...within a week she learned all the signs in it, and still she wants to watch only this video...I read that some parents complain that Baby Einstein videos are too short...too boring, etc. I think that this is the whole idea...not to overload those developing brains...sometimes I think that even Sesame Street is too much for very young babies and toddlers...and kid's shouldn't spend all day in front of TV anyways...I let her watch it once in the morning and once in the evenining and that's it! No more TV."
5,Great DVD,"Another great DVD from Baby Einstein. This DVD make learning signs so easy. I wish I had this with my first son. My baby is only 8 months old so he only watches it for entertainment, but I'm sure he'll pick something up along the way. I really use it to teach myself - and in that regard I think it excells. Marlee Matlin is great, as always."
2,Disappointed,"I have taught all of my hearing grandchildren to sign and I was hopeful that this third DVD in the Baby Einstein ""language series"" would be added to our language library. Although the word selection is better than the previous two videos in this series, I was disappointed with the format.The format does not hold the attention of my grandchildren and it is does not offer the repetition necessary to learn spoken words or sign language. Several words and signs are presented in rapid succession followed by extended scenes for each word. Then the same words and signs are presented again by a child who is clearly old enough to be speaking. The program also lacks a tutorial for grandparents and parents who are teaching their babies to use sign language for the first time.All of my grandchildren have learned to sign and speak from the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series and I would recommend this series for babies who cannot yet speak or are just learning to speak."
1,Signing Time! is sooo much better!!!,"My kids love to sign, so we try and watch every signing video available, but this one went right back to the library. My kids and I were so disappointed with this video. I must say that this area is just not in Beby Einstein's expertise and just because they have a famous deaf actress does not make it good. If your kids truely want to learn a large vocabulary of American Sign Language, then look into the Signing Time video series."
2,Boring,My 8 month old didn't care for this video at all. My husband and I thought it was kind of boring also. It was really slow and not very good at keeping one's attention.
4,Good starter video for learning baby sign language,"This was our first experience with baby sign language, and it's fine, but it's not terribly thorough. If you are wanting a more inclusive repertoire of signs then this is not the right choice for you."
2,Signing Time is way better!,"I checked out Signing Time DVDs from the local library for my daughter. She LOVES them. I thought she would like this too. She does, but not me. I agree with another reviewer about the ""filler""--too much time showing the pictures but not enough for the signs. The music and scenes make it somewhat entertaining for little kids, like other Baby Einstein DVDs, but not very educational. So if you shopping for DVDs teaching sign language, there are better options."
3,"Ok, but much better signing videos out there","This video is more of a typical Baby Einstein video with a few signs thrown in here and there. They don't teach the signs, just show them quickly, followed by pictures of what the signs mean. Way more ""filler"" than signs, which was disappointing. It's a cute video, but I think there are much better signing videos out there. Baby Signing Times for example."
2,Baby Einstein - My First Signs,"It is impressive how my son, now 15 months, gets completely absorbed with all the Baby Einstein products my wife and I have previously purchased (My First Moves, Neighborhood Animals, Baby Beethoven, Baby Mozart). With this one, though (which by the way said was precisely for children in that age range), his attention was only captured for the first 5 minutes. Analyzing it from a non-target customer standpoint, I think it is not in the same category as the other ones I've seen, quality wise. Maybe my expectations were too high but I can honestly say I was a little disappointed with this product. Maybe someone can recommend other BE products that are as good as the others. Thanks."
3,Not great,"Not nearly as captivating to my baby as ""My baby can talk"" videos. I do like that they showed ""Please and thank you"" in a little skit. My daughter has learnt over ten signs from my baby can talk videos and no signs from baby Einstein video. She doesn't get excited for it either. I do like the signs they teach though, perhaps can be considered more useful than the my baby can talk ones."
4,good stuff,"Baby loves the DVD. Hopefully she'll be signimg in no time!DVD nneded some polishing, but that was an easy fix."
2,My son doesn't like it,"I thought this would be a neat addition to my Baby Einstein Collection. But my son won't watch it. I've tried several times, and each time he doesn't even last 1 minute. He prefers the more musical dvd's."
4,13 month old twins,My twin boys love this video. James is learning fast and does the signs with the video. Jakub just loves to watch.
5,The *best!*,"I think this is the very best of the Baby Einstein videos. The entire thing is Marlee Matlin and babies signing and being positively adorable. The skits are nice and short and cuter than most. My baby adores it, plus hopefully she is learning a few signs! If you're only going to get one Baby Einstein.. get this one!"
4,Not All it's Hyped up to Be,"I'm not just one of the many Baby Einstein fanatics out there but since I was interested in baby sign language I bought it. It is really simple and easy to follow, even for babies. I don't think it could be done better. But my main problem with it is it's just too long, my son wouldn't sit for that long but it's worked for a few signs and I plan on using it for my 2nd son too. Overall it's okay but it wasn't like ""wow this is the best thing ever"" like all my mommy friends claimed."
1,Disappointing,"I was so excited about watching this for the first time with my son. I should have known that it would be just like all the other Baby Eintein videos...very poorly put together. The signs are not shown enough for an infant or toddler to grasp them. There are too many ""filler"" scenes and pictures. It also did not hold my son's attention. I have heard very good things about the ""Signing Time"" videos. I found out that our public television station is going to start showing them beginning in April 07. I am going to record them and watch them with my son. I hope they are much better than what I just watched on the Baby Einstein DVD."
1,strongly NOT recommend this series to baby < 2 yr,"My son is now 1 year and 11 month old, from his very early time, about 3~4 month old, we began to introduce Baby Einstein series to him. He could not without the shows later, averagely watch 3~4 hrs per day. Now he is nearly two years old, but could not even speak out 6~8 words, much late than my friend's son (the same age), my brother's daughter and my sister's son (compare them at the same age). I become to suspect if the Baby Einstein shows do benifit younger babies. The shows seldom speak, mostly music or silence. I really regret that my son spend too much (one and half year) on Baby Einstein. listein to me, talk with you baby, NOT let the Baby Einstein do that."
2,This book's for you....if you've done little research,"A good book for the person embarking on their adoption journey. However, if you've already adopted and have done a bit of research into adoptive parenting, you are most likely already aware of how to deal with many of the situations presented in this book."
4,Good book for many types of parents,"This is a good book to have in any home's collection of adoption books. It discusses a variety of different topics, and covers everything from infancy to teen years. While some of the aspects of the book were not useful yet (I am adopting a young child), the resources in this book will be valuable as she grows up. Worth your consideration."
2,Yet another mediocre suspense thriller,"I was not impressed with this film. Watching it, I felt like I was seeing dozens of other mediocre horror films combined into one. A young fighting couple experience an automotive breakdown in the middle of the night on a deserted road. They end up in a run down motel run by a creepy caretaker (a little bit like Pscyho, but not nearly as good). They then find a stash of tapes in their room showing previous guests in the room being tortured and murdered. Soon they find themselves under attack by the same group of masked killers. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale do a really weak job as the lead characters. Their fear never seems credible, and neither does this movie. Don't waste your time."
4,almost 'classic',"I thought the movie was well written, with the usual 'idiot' moments that most horror movies have. I am constently asking myself ""why are they opening that door"" ""looking out that window, to be seen"" ""making so much noise""Otherwise it makes me think of the older classic suspense films with added ""f"" words. Personally I think the movie would have been better without the filthy language.Am I the only one that couldn't understand what Kate Beckinsale was saying when she was apologizing about their son? I replayed it a dozen times trying to understand the mumbling, but never could get it:("
4,Suprisingly good,"After reading all the negative reviews and putting aside my fears of wasting my time with this film, I was actually quite surprised with how good it was. While some of it is formulaic, I believe that this ""horror"" movie contains two of the smartest protagonists ever. Luke Wilson's character does not act with the usual ""let's separate and go into the woods"" mentality. Wilson's performance was pretty good as well - quite believable. May not be for the Saw and Friday the 13th or gorefest fans - but a nice little flick which packs a couple of thriller punches. I recommend spending the 85 minutes."
3,GOOD ENOUGH TO WATCH ONCE BUT NOT TWICE!,"I was not expecting much when I sat down to watch this, so I was pleasantly surprised to find myself jumping at parts. There were a few good scares so I am glad that I took the time to watch it. As far as the story line went...it was so so. The movie lacked character depth, but then again, it is a horror movie after all!"
2,Not real good...,"...but not the worst of its kind. I actually thought the opening exposition scenes were pretty good, pretty creepy. If we hadn't all known what was coming, the first half hour might have been pretty effective. And I actually appreciated the ending -- thank God they spared us the extended Halloween / Friday the 13th non-surprises. The film was blissfully brief. Unfortunately, any satisfaction during the intervening 50 minutes or so requires an impossible suspension of disbelief. Why did these guys, who obviously had this act down to a fairly well-oiled machine, deviate from the game plan for this couple? Why did they give them any room to maneuver? If they were this incompetent, how had they been so successful in their earlier attempts? It seems this would have been a fairly easy hole for a decent writer to fill (""Damn! Why did this Kiwanis convention have to arrive just when we were trying to enjoy our evening?""), but they didn't bother here. Too bad..."
2,What's in a name?,"It would seem, from reading the reviews, that, the ""Vacancy"" refered to here, is the ABSENCE of PLOT and, SCARINESS!"
1,The worst horror movie ever,"This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I love horror movies, but I was ready to walk out of the theatre. Luke Wilson must have really needed the money to make this film. I would only rent this if you have seen everything else....twice."
2,One of the most pointless movies I have ever seen,"I can't believe I just sat through this whole movie only to discover there is absolutely no point. I am a big fan of both Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale and I am surprised that both of them chose to be in this movie. Is there suspense? A little bit. Is is predictable? Totally. I feel completely cheated for sticking it out and wasting my time watching a bunch of gross, sick, twisted violence for such a crappy ending. I highly recommend not wasting your time watching this movie. This is the type of movie a high school kid could write up on a bad day. Unreal, it was that terrible. Do not watch this movie. It is pathetic that it was even made. This is a totally honest review, no holds barred. A total piece of junk movie."
1,"Vacancy shakancy....awful, awful,","We had high hopes for a bit of updated Hitchcockian film viewing, murder-mystery-suspense wise. This was horror-horrible viewing. Amateurish in all aspects, with Luke Wilson paying off very grudgingly on a debt he owed, the certain victim of cheating. This movie was awful, disjointed, poorly shot, terribly lighted-blocked-etc. Very off-putting, very much back-on-the-shelf-putting."
3,Whateva',"I rented this on ON DEMAND for $3.99 this morning and it was so-so. If they would credit me $3.50 back on my Comcast bill I would say that I got my money's worth. What can I say? This film is, what it is. This is the kind of mess you watch when you have nothing better to do at 4:30 in the morning. Briefly, this film was short, sweet and to the point. The acting was somewhat blah but was tolerable. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale probably only acted in this mess to pay off a past due car note. Neither seemed all that thrilled to be in this production. Additionally, I felt that the sets were cheap and the lighting was bad teamed with the fact that Katie B. needed moisturizer and makeup, as she looked an ashy mess in some scenes. However, I will say one thing for this film. The plot was solid, even though it was executed sloppily. All in all this is okay to watch on one of your bored restless moments but I wouldn't break my neck to find this in the DVD isle. 2.5 stars for me."
2,disappointing,"The film has decent screenplay, but the plot is dry and predictable with no twists. Kept expecting Luke Wilson to start cracking jokes, was hard to see him in a dramatic role - not his fault - he did well.Well acted, poorly written bomb. Hardly worthy of Blu-ray price or for that matter the format itself.The only reason it is above a 1 rating is Wilson and Beckinsale save this otherwise journey to nowhere."
2,Is that a knock i hear ?,"In the 2006 movie ""When a stranger calls"" with Camilla Belle, it was the phone ringing or her calling someone every 30 seconds. In ""Vacancy"" it was the knocks and pounding on the walls and doors that made me want to turn this movie off. Then of course it was the cell phone that didn't work when you needed it most or having to get out of the Hotel room NOW but oh, what ever you do to get out, don't break out the bathroom window that is nailed shut ! Maybe i'm just too picky, but this movie is full of holes and not much surprised me when i watched it. Might be the worst movie i ever saw Kate Beckinsale in ( and the only one ). Either way, i would highly recommend watching it first before you buy it."
3,It's ok...,It's actually an ok movie...little doldrum in spots. Only thing I didn't like was the ending.
1,An utter waste of time,"Make a checklist of horror movie cliches before you watch, then check them off. They hardly miss a one. There's the guy who ""fixes"" their car, the creepy motel manager (they missed calling him Norman), the illogical plot - why would they watch the cop they called from a window instead of calling out? If you read this then watch it anyway, at least you can't say you weren't warned. Yawn."
4,good movie,"this movie was pretty good and one of the better thrillers/horror movie i have seen in a while. i really enjoyed the story between the couple. in my opinion everything was great except for the ending. it wasn't bad, just not great."
2,"Stong start, weak finish...","Well, I have to say my expectations for this film were low. I rented it as a fluff popcorn piece, not as a event. It fit that bill fairly well, but it started a lot stronger than it finished. It was good at setting up the mood and vision but then mid way, it felt a bit repetitive. The end was just weak. I knew exactly how it would end; nothing was surprising or tense. Too formula for a movie that had a minor twist on a horror staple. Acting was credible, other than Kate and Luke had zero chemistry. Its a good time killer (pun intended) but pass on down the road if you are looking for real suspense."
3,Not too bad,"I don't think this movie is the best I have ever seen, but definately not the worst. It had it's moments that was thrilling. I didn't shut it off in the middle, so I can say it held my interest."
3,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised w/ this flick. I went in with low expectations because it's always a hit/miss with this genre--and mostly ""miss,"" although it's by far my favorite (genre).I found both the acting and direction strong and, although certainly not the most original, the story riveting. My only complaint was that the viewer is forced to suspend disbelief at the end w/ a few aspects of the wrap up. But all in all, a good one for the genre."
3,Your Typical Little Thriller,"Decent acting saves this movie. Everything is formula. The ending was the only major downside, but the film breezes by pretty fast. Wait for the DVD and save you money for Spider-Man 3 next weekend."
4,What do you want?,"If its a movie that goes beyond a cheap horror flick with accurate details and realism, go ahead and give it a bad reviews and move on, but I like cheap horror flicks and this one has a plot that movies along and kept me grabbing popcorn. The old formula of twisted back woods folk taking advantage of unsuspecting city slickers with various terror techniques and weapons of mass destruction never grows old and this flick moves right into that slot and does a good job at it. Does it all have to make sense? No and I liked it that way."
1,Yuck- did not even want to give it one star!,"This was a horrible waste of my time. I am certainly glad I rented it through an online membership instead of even paying full rental price. Not for intelligent people -- you could predict everything that was going to happen. The really bad part was that they used a child's death to tear the marriage apart and even hinted that it was the mother's fault -- low, very low. So, unless you are the type of person like the sickos in the movie (demented) or you are of a pretty low intelligence level, pass on this one."
2,"Sorry, even for a ""B"" movie","Go back to the drawing board, not worth it, not scary, exciting, or even suspenseful, it bombed in theaters and has bombed as a DVD."
2,Poorly done,The writing in this film is poorly done and the plot lacks intensity. The dialogue is just plain silly.
4,MADE ME JUMP!!,"This movie was great. Good enough to watch over and over, a lot of suprises i didn't see coming. kate beckinsale, such a talented woman, does here thing on here. luke wilson equally as good. they have such good chemistry on camera. and despite their marital problems you can't help but root for them. their car breaks down and they end up in some out of the way rundown roach infested motel. well what seems to be normal, is anything but. next thing you know they're running for their lives and they see no way out. they must come together in order to survive the night. the acting was great, the suspense was right on. I wouldn't change a thing, I expected it to be so so, but it truly was good and it gets you on some parts. makes you wonder next time you drive by one of these places what the hell goes on there."
4,A New Horror Classic!!!,"This movie was pretty creepy. It kind of reminds me of Psycho, but without Norman and the shower scene. A couple who lost their son and about to get a divorce gets lost in the middle of a small town and have to stay at a hotel. The hotel's manager and other town's people are the makers of snuff films. When Luke Wilson and sexy Kate Beckinsale find out, they try to escape at any means possible. I highly recommend VACANCY!!!"
3,Weird in a good way,"The director himself said that he focused more on making a stylish movie than making a scary movie. What comes out is something that feels like a Tarantino horror movie.This movie isn't scary and probably could have used some more gore just to set a more serious tone. Others have mentioned that the leads were probably too famous and I agree. I just never took them too seriously even when they were clearly in danger. Previous movies like ""deliverance"" have managed to use comedy actors in serious situations but this movie doesn't.But it was worth watching for me. Frank Whaley definitely delivers a good performance. I like the fact that each character has its own rhythm and it is maintained throughout the movie. And while I wasn't frightened I was definitely paying attention to the action.Worth a rent."
4,"""Vacancy"" isn't that bad","""Vacancy"" reminds me of ""The Strangers"", except it's less disturbing and it's not based on a true story, but it still can be an intense and creepy film. It starts pretty slow, with opening credits that last for a couple minutes (but in a cool style), and a long opening car scene, with additional fighting, but once the banging on the door starts, the terror is basically non-stop. I have to say, the scene with the snuff films is the most disturbing scene in the movie. There are a lot of different intense scenes in this movie that make it worthwhile, like the scene where they're crawling in that tunnel and the ending that isn't 100% happy, but it's good enough. ""Vacancy"" is a pretty good and intense film that's good enough for a couple more views."
2,A good premise that is spoiled by the characters' stupidity,"The premise of Vacancy is intriguing. People who spend the night at this down-and-out motel are subjected to torture and the horror of hearing others tortured. When the protagonist couple settle into their room and realize something is terribly wrong, they try to escape. This could lead to a great cat-and-mouse movie, but it is spoiled by the fact that the couple just isn't very resourceful. You'll find yourself yelling at the TV in frustration when they fall to try some of the most obvious things, and meekly fail to fight when the opportunity presents itself. What could have been a taut thriller cops out by making the character too weak and dumb to launch a true escape plan. Very disappointing."
4,The psycho always knocks twice (or more),"Oh my! - yet another seedy gas station/motel staffed by twitching yocals. Okay, so Antal and Smith cover no new ground here but their reworking of conventional themes is well done. They keep their tongues firmly in cheek while composing a taut and suspenseful little chiller. Even though it's pretty clear where the plot's going it still keeps the viewer gripped. The performances from the small cast are good, with the ravishing Ms Beckinsale giving the best performance I've seen from her to date. A simple suspense flick that ticks all the right boxes. What's not to like?"
3,PSYCHO CRAZY,"This movie was intense. It wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be. After Luke Wilson's character puts in a video that was on one of the shelves in their room - in the less than five star motel - he notices that people were being murdered in the same exact room they are in. Of course, noticing this he freaks out and he and his wife try to leave; but, what kind of PSYCHO CRAZY KILLER is gonna let that happen?! Bottom line this movie will have you on the edge of your seat and will suprise you until the end. If you like scary movies without so much gory scenes, this would be a good choice."
1,The Title Says It All,"From the acting, direction, suspense factor,etc. to the ending. A completely unsatisfying movie and a waste of time. A completely predictable movie. The title of the movie is what my room should have been when I decided to watched this movie. See ""Disturbia"" instead."
3,Good up Until the End,"Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson portray a husband and wife torn apart by the death of their son. On their way home from her parent's anniversary party we witness the sarcasm and hate that has crept into their marriage.Off the beaten track their car deserts them and they end up taking refuge in a shady motel where they quickly learn that they are not the guests but the prey.This was a tension packed psychological thriller that kept us hopping, literally; from the verbal discourse in the car to the nightmare in the motel room. The unfortunate thing is the ending was a fizzle. After all that mayhem it just didn't satisfy."
3,Not too shabby for what it is,"Vacancy is fairly taut boilerplate horror. It'll have your heart going for a little while, and then exits smartly at 85 minutes, delivering your basic motel-from-hell chills. If you aren't expecting anything new out of horror these days(and with the exception of 'Sublime', who in their right mind would?) then this is worth a used buy or a rental. All in all, competent-but predictable and uninventive."
4,"excellent plot, good acting","The plot is intriguing, not predictable yet not so complex one gets tangled in the twists. A fifties era motel provides nostalgia and the acting is superb. Excess foul language and violence detract but do not spoil the movie. One finds themself caring what happens next. Unfortunately the picture lacks quality music, costumes, makeup and comic relief. Still it is worth seeing."
3,3 stars for artistry,"It's very well done and designed, very taut, and picks a few bones from the original Psycho. Set design, cinematography, and acting... all top notch. I find pseudo-snuff and cruelty very hard to stomach, but it's done sparingly enough here, unless you like gorno, then you can watch the Snuff Extras on the Special features. I wish I had passed on those."
2,Thank God it was only 99 cents,"I was really psyched to see this movie, the promos made it look so thrilling. I had to force myself to watch it, it was that bad. I still don't understand it. I can't believe people are giving this tripe good reviews. I can't believe that Luke & Kate agreed to star in this unbelievably bad movie."
2,What a waste,"Let me get this straight. In this movie, Kate Beckinsale... well, here's the official synopsis:When David (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox's (Kate Beckinsale) car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, they are forced to spend the night at the only motel around... until they discover hidden cameras aimed at them...And the end result is... a slasher movie???? How can you mess up that concept? I can't believe any director in Hollywood has never seen a ""Girls Gone Wild"" video."
3,Not the Thriller you think it is !,I bought this DVD based on reviews here. I am very sorry I did. This movie is average. Period. This is NOT the Scary Thriller people have rated this to be. I did not jump out of my skin and did not find this to be the big scary thriller movie reviewers have stated it is. Please. Don't waste your hard earned money. Rent it. Don't buy it. You'll end up selling it if you do.
2,"Totally Lame Excuse For ""Slasher"" Movie","There was nothing in this movie that hasn't been seen a thousand times before. Pretty much just take the plot of ""Psycho"", a movie that's over 40 years old, add some poorly conceived snuff elements, and one idiotic decision by the victims after another, and you have a movie that was released in January on purpose. Everyone I watched this with said ""grab the gun"" about 45 minutes before the dumb girl finally thought of it. On a side note, the addition of the snuff films as a bonus was in really bad taste. We fast forwarded through it and checked the timer, and they run for over 30 minutes. Is there a reason someone would want to sit through young girls being beaten, stripped naked and stabbed to death? Only for sickos."
4,No set of cards is complete without a set of tree oracle cards,I was not disappointed when I opened these cards. Great artwork on the cards and I love to learn different information about the different types of trees
5,Absolutely Awesome,"This is one of the greatest compilation CD's I've ever come across for any band. I am like a lot of people when it comes to such things; I only know two or three of the songs before I buy the thing, and I only listen to the others about once. This disc is different. I still only knew the first two tracks, but I grew to love the others after hearing them just once! The disc offers good coverage of the Wetton years of Asia, before all the breakups. It includes several songs from each of the early and middle albums, and puts them in order of their debut (Asia, Alpha, Astra, Then & Now). Geffen and 20th Century did an excellent job mastering the audio; it sounds excellent. Asia is never given due credit, but this band pioneered many of the aspects of music we take for granted today. This compilation offers all the songs one would ever need to hear to understand why the last sentence is 100% true. Happy listening."
1,"Avoid - Not a real CD, does not rip to MP3.","While this disc contains a decent selection of Asia's songs, it doesn't actually carry the Compact Disc logo. This usually happens when labels try some bogus copy protection scheme on a disc, and this one is no exception. It looks like they have put a fake, empty data partition on the CD to trip up people who try and rip the tracks to MP3 on their computers.It's a shame, because this is an otherwise fine collection of songs.While it is still possible to rip the songs to MP3 (by recording the tracks one at a time and then ripping them), the annoyance involved means you are better off just buying a different greatest hits collection such as the Definitive Collection or Asia Gold.On a personal note, I also missed the presence of the Roger Dean artwork that graced the original album covers."
4,Were are you brian lamort aka pushead?,"One of the best h.c bands and artist of the 80s whos art is featured on many h.c bands,pushead,lamort great stuff here if any one can get it on import from japan it includes kichigai,burial,etc...."
4,If you like noise - then split your head with this album.,"Septic Death is a chaotic mix of hardcore punk-industrial noise from the old school. Featuring ""Pushead"", the artist of Misfits and Metallica fame as well as skate art, this album could very well be played backwards and not sound terribly different. Sound interesting? If you have a taste for hardcore noise, Septic Death is your group. Hard fast grating guitar licks, a drummer that must be heard to be believed, and the screeching growl of the vocals carried along by heavy bass lines makes this band worth a try."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"This is one of those rare books I simply could not stop reading! I highly recommend it. The interviews are intimate and illuminating, and I think young adults in particular will be inspired, though middle-aged ones like myself can take heart in how much these folks are STILL achieving well after 70. While I enjoyed getting to know some of the famous people in a new way, I was especially impressed by stories of ""unfamous"" elders like the educators Jayme Coleman Williams and McDonald Williams, people who have had tremendous, sustained impact in their communities. The best part is, you can access even more of the work of the National Visionary Leadership Project at their web site, VisionaryProject.com"
4,Enjoyed It!!,I enjoy reading this book. Really. The reason I gave it the four stars is that there wasn't enough of them. Mostly it had stories from famous people that we already know on. What I wanted to read was from people who are not as famous. Who had a lot of things to tell. I pray there is a sequel.
5,Women's Wit,So many women sharing views through their own experiences and willing to pass such knowledge on is a wonderful tribute.
3,one of the best colored pencil artists...,"Vera Curnow is indeed one of the best colored pencil artists around. But if you are looking for an in-depth instructional book on landscape colored pencil this may not be the only book to purchase. It is a nice sampling, however, on various talented and skillful artists. If you are a budding or advanced pencil artist this would be a good addition to your library but you will need more."
5,A fabulous find,"It is hard to believe I never was required to read this wonderful book, and I am thankful to have discovered it as a result of reading a children's book based on it (by Rosemary Wells, also highly recommended) to my children. The circumstances of its writing are remarkable; the images luminous and the prose unbelievably beautiful for any author, especially for a recent immigrant. But it is the insight into her personality, culture and psyche which appeal to me the most. You will also like the personalities you meet through her. This book should be read by anyone who loves the English language, loves America, or just loves a window into the soul of another."
4,Interesting but not the greatest,"I remember reading this work years ago in connection with the study I was then making of American Jewish Literature. My impression was much that of another Amazon reader. It is at times a vivid account of a new immigrant experience, but the tale is not told with the deepest intensity of feeling. It may be unfair but the comparison which comes to mind is with Henry Roth's ""Call it Sleep"" which is a fictional work but one which goes deep into the soul and consciousness. This work is a more externally directed narrative, and has its virtue in giving a picture of one person's move to the New World."
1,Old Edition,This is too old of an edition and the essays listed in my syllabus are not where they should be by page number. UGH.
3,Not nearly as comfortable as other similar or less expensive flipflops,"I splurged for these sandals based on the glowing reviews, but didn't find them to be nearly as comfortable as expected. MUCH better are the Reef Flex and Reef Fanning flipflops (best prices via Action Village). I also liked the Rider Dry WM II Thong -- the best for ALL day comfort. I will keep these Aruba thongs for their awesome orange color, but only wear them sparingly."
4,"advanced tutorials, a beautiful book","Not for the beginner. The book does not come with a CD-ROM so you're expected to bring your own raw material to the table. The overall presentation is so nice though - oversized, nicely printed and great separations - that you can leave it out as a coffee table book. Inspirational."
2,"Sorry, but no.","I really was excited to get this book and verry pissed to finally read it. The philosophy behind the books' creation is solid, from a creative pov. That rarely happens with anything. But this book had everything I already knew about layers, masks, selections. I expected a deeper digging in of photoshop and compositing materials to form a more real-world sense of how pros put together real eye-catching images. Instead it covered the first quarter of my photoshop class and the images are not that interesting. Only the cover image and one other inside was good. Otherwise this doesn't display anything new to me. What a waste. I guess mmy instructor was some kind of genius and taught us intermediate stuff right off the bat. Next time, show some realism in your work, not fluff. Sorry Dan, ya coulda' done better, I know you could have shown more powerful images and how to achieve them."
3,ETERNAL YOUTH IMMORTALIZED,"Robert Drew's groundbreaking PRIMARY (New Video Group) is a fascinating, up-close cinema verité chronicle of Kennedy's 1960 Wisconsin presidential primary run against Hubert Humphrey. See a youthful JFK capured forever. fascinating with its wit, scheming and charisma. A haunting look back at what was."
2,Narrow sandal,"This is a narrow fit sandal. Fortunately, it is an open toe sandal. Hope it won't cause bruises. The real problem is the heel is only 2.5"", feels like wearing 4"" heel, hard to balance, easy to fall over. Material is average, if not for the brand name, I'll consider $20 too expensive for the sandal."
5,Just awsome,"I got introduced to Abigail a couple of years ago with the song ""Oro y Plata."" The song is just amazing. Even friends who speak not a word of spanish think it sounds great. Mi Estrella is just as amazing; it is magical. It is the kind of album that you just can't get enough of. Abigail is just wonderful."
4,A Slice of Life -,"- Like raw liver. The poor, the desperate and the violent converge in their attempted escape to a better life in El Norte; a hope as wistful as incense before an impassive Madonna. There is no ""redemption"" here, no winners. The film's relentless brutality will dismay viewers raised on Hollywood fare of virtue's inevitable triumph. Perhaps, somewhere beyond the final reel, it does, somehow. But for two hours it's all-too-real peek at the losing struggle for security and dignity, by those for whom ""opportunity"", ""democratization"", and other Northern catchphrases are only mocking traps."
5,One of my favorite movies!!!,"This movie is good from the start.I think this is a very good interp. of MS13 in central america and a girl with a dream of coming to america.I loved how the director combined thoses two types of people together..a gang banger and a good girl.I loved how the character felt like it was his duty to help the girl get across the border. I think in someway she was his redemption because at the turning point in the movie he finally wanted to do something good with his life.I really wanted this to be a love story...but it was more than a typical movie...it felt real. Most movies are so unreal and filled with fantasy of perfect love and money, so when this came along it took all my attention. Thats why I love watching independent movies because it always gives you a diffrent experienceSadly, I knew how the movie would end while I was watching it and it made me cry ,but I felt like it was the perfect ending."
1,Avoid the UK Version,"Having purchased a Blu-Ray disc from the Amazon.fr (France) website in the past, I believed that the ""Sin Nombre"" Blu-Ray disc would work on my PS3, as the prior disc had presented no problem. However, this disc appears to be region coded, and will not work. Be forewarned that you will be paying a premium price for a paperweight if you buy from the Amazon-linked United Kingdom provider."
2,Too violent,"The movie has a noble enough plot and story; however, the characters are so cruel and the brutality so harsh, I couldn't get through the first half."
1,It's been done too many times!!,"WHEN will moviemakers STOP trying to glorify Illegals!! They are breaking the law & they know they are breaking the law!! They deserve NO SYMPATHY WHATSOEVER!! DEPORT 'EM ALL!!To quote a wise pilot from the internet: ""As you get older you will realize that one of the major reasons this world is so screwed up is because there are so many people around the world who are offended by everything everyone else does or says. Political Correctness is a cancer that has spread through the whole body of this so called Civilization we have here on earth.""So that said...If anything I say or write offends you...I am NOT sorry! If you choose to take offense, that's your problem, not mine...get over it!! I am VERY offended by people too easily offended!!! My right of free speech is as important as yours and my opinion is JUST as valid as ANY liberals, out to get every criminal & child molester off ""scot-free"" or bring every undeserving Illegal to live in USA!!!"
5,Finally a film worth watching about C.American people,"My opinion is strictly based on comparing this film ""Sin Nombre"" in comparison to previous films that depict Central American people and culture. The films that I am comparing Sin Nombre to, are, Innocent Voices (2004) (Voces inocentes (original title) by Luis Madoki, Salvador (1986) by Oliver Stone, etc. In comparing the film to those earlier films that were direct by Oliver Stone and Luis Madoki, I believe Funkunaga did a super job, especially in the cast that was chosen to depict Central American's and Mexican's. I especially like that fact that he used actor's that had a similar accent to the people of the region he is depicting. Growing up in Los Angles with a high concentration of Central American's (of Salvadorian, Guatemalan, Honduran, etc.. origin), I can clearly appreciate the small details the director toke in making the film more genuine-in the end, makes for an over all better film."
4,Second best IMHO,"I bought 5 dvd's about the border issues, this is the second best one (after Wetback- the undocumented documentary) IMHO. This is a violent movie dealing with gangs (MS13...), not for the faint of heart, beware! Highly recommended and educative re gangs actions on mojados to be."
2,Pretty pessimistic look on life,"The commentary on the situation of life here on earth was none too subtle. While the first one hits you with a sledge-hammer trying to convince you that humans are too violent to survive, this one hits you with a nuclear bomb to convince you of the same. There were some decent ideas in the show, but very little exploration of those ideas. It was too mired in political/social commentary through allegory. I was disappointed the most by the ending. The main character, Taylor, has been one of the few reasonable characters in the movies and seems to be working to save the world from destroying itself, but when he is dying, he is the one that gives up on humanity (and monkeymanity I guess) to nuke the whole planet. Pretty dark. I must admit that his ""Damn you all to hell"" is a classic line."
4,"Not as great as the 1st Apes movie, but still brilliantly deranged...","I love this movie! Especially the climatic showdon between the army of apes and the telepathic mutants. Has there ever been a more bizarre and deranged movie scene than the sight of a desert full of rows of screaming apes that have been crucified upside down and set on fire , while in the background a giant staute of a monkey God weeps tears of blood? It all turns out to be a telepathic illusion, but you'll never forget seeing it! James Franciscus is no Heston, but does a perfectly reasonable imitation until the real Chuck shows up again. The stunningly gorgeous Linda Harrison is a delight to look at in her sexy cavegirl outfit too. I also love the creepy shots of a post apocalyptic New York - all the more resonant after the horror of 9/11. All of this and an exciting climax involving Earth being nuked to smithereens! What more do you want in a movie?"
3,Harrison is a goddess-- Movie end unforgettable,"""Beneath"" is ""B"" movie bliss, served up as only the sixties could. Harrison is a goddess in cave girl threads. Franciscus is, well, swell in a kind of minnie-me Charlton Heston way. So- so in the ape make up department this time around. I mention that only because its quite glaring at points. Still, that ending! High Mass for a nuclear missle! Preformed, no less, by congregation of bizzaro burn victims in robes! The original ""Plant of the Apes"" movie is the uncontestable best, but this ones the ""B"" list highlight."
2,NOT UP TO SNUFF,"As brilliantly original as its predecessor was, this movie is crass, features a bizarre and hard-to-swallow premise and some outlandish special effects. It lacks the rich characters of the original and seems to understand half-way through that the only way to end the bloody thing is, well, to END it. Don't get me wrong -- I love the original PLANET OF THE APES and have great affection for several of its sequels, but I would be steering you in the wrong direction if I did not tell you -- skip this one; stick with No. 1 and No. 3, they are infinitely more considered. It seems as if the film-makers, surprised by the outrageous artistic and commercial appeal of the original, had to quickly throw some product out there before we lost interest."
4,its an ok movie for casual watching.,It makes a good sequel to the prime movie but maybe could be better.I liked the movie Tho. its an ok movie for casual watching.
2,THE FLY IN THE SOUP,"BENEATH isn't anywhere near as interesting or exciting as the first. I was excited to see BEANEATH but the movie soon falls apart. The main character is searching for Taylor and drags the same dumb girl from the first movie along with him on his search (after a really annoying scene where he tries to get her to speak. The scene drags on for what seems like 30 minutes). Then, we get lots of horse chasing and running away from apes which seems to last about another 30 minutes. Finally, in the most exciting part of the movie, we get to see underground New York. This is the only effective scene in the movie. After that we are introduced to mutant humans with no explanation as to how they go there, what they are, and why they are. Once we meet these mutants, BENEATH becomes a full blown B movie with over the top acting and ear piercing church songs."
4,interesting commentary on the militarization of society.,"An excellant film, although not as good as the original. It is very relavent to contemporary society. The main plot involves commenting on the militarization of one society, and the apocalyptic culture of another. Very much like an Orwellian view of society. If you liked 1984 you should dig it. END"
3,"""THE ONLY GOOD HUMAN IS A DEAD HUMAN!""","First I would like to point out that I am a pretty big fan of the POTA's series! I saw this film at the movies when it came out. That being said......I'm sorry folks, but this is not that good a movie! The first part is OK, but when they go ""beneath"" and once the religious hoopla starts, it is a complete snore fest! There is too much mumbo jumbo for this type of film and too quick a resolution! It is however essential to own, if you are going to watch the rest of the series. I am a fan of all the ape films, but this one is boring as H E L L in the middle! The DVD transfer is excellent on the new edition and 3 1/2 stars is generous."
2,Nothing beats the original!,This sequel could have been so much better. Mind readers?? It was very dry in a lot of places. It finally came alive when Heston came on screen. Fitting ending and should have stayed that way. The rest of the sequels are dogs!
3,Beneath the Planet of the apes,Good movie. I have all the movie from the planet of the apes and this one is one of the best from the set.
4,"Not bad, could have been done better","IThis movie was good, not as good as the first but good. I would have liked to have seen more of Heston. I can't understand why the humans underground took ""Tayler"" as the ememey. He was human after all. Still it was good"

4,They don't make them like they use to.,"The video was of good quality, I had't seen this in 15 years, and was pleased to see how good it was still. You just can't beat the classics."
4,Learning To Love The Bomb...,"Even though Charlton Heston is only in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES for a few minutes, it's still a good movie w/ an interesting story. James Franciscus plays the astronaut following Heston's character, and he is introduced to a surviving cult of mutated humans living underground. These odd folks have psychic abilities and a ""god"" that looks all too familiar and is definitely dangerous! BTPOTA is a near masterpiece and a nice follow-up to the original..."
4,cute,"the characters in this movie were romantic, irrational, but pleasant. while not exciting - this movie had fun moments and a happy ending. this movie is enjoyable to watch on a rainy afternoon."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I would not recommend this flashlight to anyone who actually wants to be able to see in the dark. It is really dim and you can hardly see an inch in front of you with this flashlight. My recommendation......don't waste your money on this.
2,"Unless you need the ""industrial"" features, better/cheaper options are available","I bought this from Amazon the same week my wife bought a cheap ""battery brand"" flashlight from the battery section at the grocery store, for roughly 75% less.The cheap flashlight uses an LED, and this one has a bulb, so shock-resistance wise the cheap one wins out. The cheap flashlight was considerably brighter. The cheap flashlight requires one battery, and this one two - this one is heavier, and less efficient. They are both made from roughly the same materials. They both had similar ""anti-roll"" features and spots for hanging them up.Overall, the cheap flashlight beat this one hands-down. I'd much rather have four of those than one of these. The only reason I'd suggest buying one is if you need the ""industrial"" features (ie, oil, gas, chemical resistance) or if you just want to buy a flashlight from Amazon. Otherwise, add ""flashlight"" to your grocery list, and enjoy the savings."
4,Working Flashlight at reasonable price,"The flashlights I received were orange, but same model. They work, reasonable priced and arrived in a timely fashion. After the big storm (Sandy) I decided to make sure every room has a flashlight."
3,Average Flashlight,"There is nothing wrong with this flashlight, but I much prefer my Dorcy 4 LED bulb floating waterproof flashlight. The Dorcy is much brighter. I bought this Rayovac and the Dorcy. But after trying them both, I bought 3 more Dorcys."
5,Good Inexpensive Flashlight,We have Maglights but I was looking for a few good inexpensive flashlights that are sturdy that we can leave in strategic places around the house for those long term power failures the Northeast has been having. The packing claims it has been dropped from seven feet with no damage. I am five feet so that is a good thing - two feet of leeway. I am happy with these lights and I would highly recommend them for the spare flashlight you can never seem to find. Buy two!
4,Rayovac IN2 Industrial Flashlight,We received our rather large order of Rayovac IN2 Industrial Flashlights from Amazon.com in a very timely manner. The Rayovac IN2 is a very sturdy and well made flashlight.
4,Maag at his best!,"As expected Maag is a great Mozartean. Jungwirth and Bladin are excellent and the rest of the cast is strong to decent. The weak point is that, although the performance is in stereo, the sound of this broadcast is not the greatest."
2,Not Worth Buying on Hardback,"The book advanced a little but pace was still too slow and focused too much on the least interesting of the major characters, namely Elayne, Perrin and Faile - not enough of Rand.Most everyone seems to be raving about this book simply for the fact that it advanced the storyline which made it a whole lot better than the last one. That is not a good enough reason to rate it 4 or 5 stars. It should be rated as a stand alone book and frankly, if this book was written by someone else other than Robert Jordan (whose acclaim is resting on the strength of the story and the earlier books) this book would be torn apart and would be lucky to get more than a 2 star rating.Visit your local library if you just have to read this book in hardcover or do as I did - share and split the price of the book with 3 friends."
2,At last... some small progress towards a conclusion !,"This series started with great flourish and promise .. but started to drift off course by book 5.. I stuck with it and trudged grimly through books 6 to 10, hoping for a glimpse of the spark and energy that had been evident in the first part of the series. Let me make it clear, books 6 through 10 did nothing of note or worth, and could have easily been condensed into one volume which would have been of minor interest. Book 11 ""Knife of dreams"" is a little better, making some small progress and closing off some sub-plots with moderate success. However I am convinced that the author has largely lost his way with this series. His creation has gotten away from him, and is now peopled with weak and confusing characters and utterly irrelevant sub-plots and red herrings. Enough I cry !!! Please, please, Mr Jordan get a grip on this saga !!"
2,Endless,"There are people who have died before seeing the ending of this story! Loyal fans for years, and years, and years. I wont be one of them.I got about halfway through Book 10, closed the cover in disgust. I no longer had patience or interest in going one page further."
3,Okay,"Some good story lines but a lot of fluff and irrelevant stories (maybe they will hold some value when the next book comes out in what 2 years).The story really only moves forward in the sense that everyone says the last battle is near and Lan goes riding for it.Rand and Perrin show no growth or development. We will have to wait and see if Rand's new injury is just for shock or has a purpose.Mat seems to be the only character growing up and truly getting ready.It would seem that Jordan's final book should be ready since ""he has had the last battle in his mind since the begining"" or something like that.Also, if you have not read any of the books so far do not start until the last one has a publication date."
2,A dysfunctional relationship,"Why I keep reading Jordan's drivel is beyond me. The first half-a-dozen or so were truly wonderful. The last have been mind-numbing. It takes him so long to write these things (he probably whips one out in a month or two only after he's short of cash) I can barely remember who the characters are, much less their story. I'm starting to root for the Dark Lord! Just get it over with!So much promise at the start. What a shame to fumble at the goal line. (Or have we crossed mid-field yet?)"
2,The series that would never end.....,"I'm very disappointed with how this series is going. It was so promising for the first few books, and now it just seems to be sinking into an extremely verbose repetitive cycle. The characters are flat and robotlike, and the plot is stuck in place. I'll have to seriously consider before buying the next installment."
3,Things actually happen!,"Well at least after the first roughly four hundred pages when Rand appears who seems to have trouble making his way into the last few novels since he is merely the Dragon Reborn( not like he's the main character or anything). From there some minor plot lines are tidied up, hopefully to make room for plot advancement in the next novel. That fact alone makes Knife of Dreams a huge improvement over Crossroads of Twilight.However, don't feel left out as the usual flat characters that are easily lumped together like cranky Aes Sedai. Like many of the recent novels in this series, Knife of Dreams could have been a quick moving Three to Four Hundred paged book. Also many sudden events are buried in dull descriptions that make it easy to miss as you start to scan, hoping for something, anything to happen. Still Knife does enough to make me want to read book twelve and dream that Twelve books makes a great series."
3,How long to wait for resolution,FYI I just looked over the dates of publications for all 11 books in this series. Here is a short comparison of times between publication dates. Between book 1 and book 2: 10 months. Between book 2 and book 3: 11 months. (jump ahead about 13 years) Between book 9 and book 10: 34 months. Between book 10 and book 11: 34 months. At this rate I think it is useless to hope for book 12 anytime before Summer 2008. And will that be the end of this opus? So far this series has been 17 years in the making. Shall we hope for denouement by the year 2010?
2,Left for a new comer!!!!,"Having grown tired of endless plots that drone on and so many characters, you have to reread the previous book, maybe two before you remember what's going on, I finally gave up and went with newcomer. Brian S Pratt's The Unsuspecting Mage gives what Robert Jordan no longer does, Action! Action! Action!I liked the Wheel of time, the first 5-6 years I read it. But it never ended.this new guy may not be a world class auther, it being his first one, but it kept me engrossed and actually found it harder to put down than it was to pick up Knife of Dreams.I am a loyay Robert Jordan fan, will be with him through to the end, no matter how long it takes, I just wish it got my pulse racing as it once had. I sincerely hope the ending will be worth the time, patience and money I've invested."
4,The Saga Continues,"Several subplot lines are resolved or close to resolution in this 11th book of the series. None of the following plot comments will ruin the book, but don't read on if you don't want to know. Mat and Tuon get married; Egewin begins to unite the White Tower; Fraile and Perrin are reunited; and Elayne appears headed toward the Andor throne. If you didn't know these would happen eventually, you can't be a fan of the series. In a bit of a surprize, a tear came to my eye when Nynave sent Lan accross the borderlands and took steps to revive Malkier. The pace is much better than in books 4 through 10. But, it still appears like there will be at least two more books before the series is concluded."
3,Get on with it.,"This book is better than the last several. That's the best I can say about it. In my opinion, the last five could have been condensed into one book, which followed the main characters and their plotlines.I can say this though, unlike the last 2 books, I read the whole of it. The last several have been such that I read only the first several chapters, then jumped to the middle, then the end, just to save myself hundreds of pages of pointless detail, zero plot advancement, and the utter drudgery that his convoluted plot-lines have spun into.This one actually has made me hunger for the next book though, and I might even get it in hard-cover."
3,Pretty darn good,"It is not a life-altering piece of literature, but the author has done a good job of redeeming himself after seemingly stalling the action in the previous book. The wordy, page-eating descriptions of what everyone is wearing still show up but much of the laboriously slow planning and meeting sequeces of previous installments has been replaced with a planning, meeting AND action sequences that made the series so popular. The battle-scenes are back with a vengeance along with the occasional, seemingly random occurence of the real bad guy making his presence known to the protagonists, foreshadowing the last battle.The plot has streamlined itself somewhat, focusing on Perrin, Mat, Egwene, Elayne and Rand, resolving some of the minor characters' issues. Unlike the immediately previous installments, there are indications that the author has a good idea of where the series is going and has a mind to wrap it up."
4,Finally!,Elayne is FINALLY made queen of Andor... perhaps one of the most boring story lines in the series. Great book overall.
2,"Tedious, tedious","I bought all of the books in the series for my Kindle. While wading through the first 8 books of this series, I learned that nothing much happens until the final few chapers. For the rest, I looked ing up the plots online. Money-wise, shouldn't have bought Books 6 and onward."
1,Worst book of the series.,"THe whole section dedicated to Perrin and Mat are worthess.So that leaves you with the 2 paragraphs on the only character that can fight the ""dark one"". I mean seriously, jordan could of handled Perrin's part in a page, Mat's in 2 pages. THERE'S NO ACTION for most of the book. People lose limbs over stupid bitches(how do you let a chick talk you into lettin her into a dangerous situation? THas a bad reflection on Jordan) and other dialougue i've read a million times in the other 23 books, takes place again.THis book just sucks, and i want the weeks i spent reading this series n my life back cause its all a waste of time."
5,Penultimate,"-UPDATED REVIEW-I remember how much I enjoyed this volume back in 2005, but I definitely don't remember it being this good. What a difference it's making to read the whole series consecutively without multi-year gaps in between! So many plot events we've been waiting books to see resolved are resolved, and so many others are established that it's clear Jordan truly did intend to make this the penultimate volume in the series. And so, for the first time in more than 7 years, I am moving on to a volume in the Wheel of Time that I haven't read . . . and I can't wait!"
4,Finally getting somewhere,"I enjoyed the first 6 (or 7) books, but the last few years have become a grind. This book at least gives a faint shimmering hope of final resolution. If 12 isn't the end, I'm done. One gets the feeling that Robert Jordan has a couple kids in college and the last few books have been nothing but tuition money. Still, this book was quite an improvement over the last couple of offerings."
5,Stop Complaining,"I wish that everyone would stop complaining about how slow the series has progressed. The simple fact of the matter is that Jordan has done something truly amazing. He has craft what might be labeled a realistic fantasy series. Instead of the fast paced adventure yarn that so many books in this genre become, Jordan has created a rich world filled with endless complexity. In this world, things cannot be resolved with a simple wave of a hand. Everything is soaked in politics and every move involves careful planning and thought (even then things don't always go the way they were planned). This is the way wars really happen. This is the way real life really happens. The entire world doesn't simply fall behind you because you might be the reincarnation of some famous leader. I respect what Jordan has done here and if it is a little slower than your average swordswinger I accept that willingly."
4,The Tension Builds,"Wow! Eleven books and we still aren't quite sure how things are going to end up. This was a fun and fast read - much more exciting then its predecessor. We finally see Elayne, Mat, Perrin and few others coming into their own. It's been a long way since the Two Rivers. Thankfully, Jordan is getting us prepared for the Final Battle. This is an important book in the Wheel of Time series (as are all of them really) and you might want to wait to read it just before the book 12 release. I made the mistake of reading it too quickly and will probably reread it before 12.If you like epoch Fantasy series start this series at the beginning: The Eye of the World. Jordan is a master storyteller. Thanks to my friend Preston J. for turning me on to this author."
5,great book,a great read that kept me entertained for a good long time. delivery was very fast and it arrived in perfect condition.
4,Back on Track,"As many others have noted, after losing control of myriad plots and slowing the pace to a crawl for a few books, Jordan has gotten back almost to the level of some of the great earlier books. Things are clearly moving toward a conclusion now, and unlike a few books ago when I found myself hoping he'd just wrap it up, again I am almost sad that the ride has to end."
1,RJ is at it again! No spoilers,"Wow! Just when you thought this series was the worst thing ever...Jordan begins to focus on important things like ""plot"" in this installment. I was surprised to see that Jaime, er, Rand, was injured. I wonder if he'll get a golden one to replace it? Also, Durnik, I mean Perrin, finds his bird. Polgara, I mean Moiraine, is still in purgatory, and it's up to Mat, Belgarath, er, Thom, and someone else to free her. Meanwhile, the Fremen, er, Aiel, are still a force to be reckoned with, and we get a nice bit of swordfighting, straight out of Steve Perry, in the first chapter. Ahh. Now that there are others to imitate, RJ can resume his storytelling."
1,WORST BOOK EVER,"How did the series come to this? I won't spend a lot of time writing how disappointing Knife of Dreams was because so many reviewers have already done so. Reading the encyclopedia is more enjoyable than reading the last 4 books of this series. I demand that Robert Jordan use the first 100 pages of his next book as an apology for how far he let his story slip. Oh, and as for that stupid quote from Jordan on the bookcover saying how he learned to read at age 4, you would think that his vocab would be amazing for such a gifted learner. How many times has he used the words ""diffident"" or ""miasma"" in a ridiculous attempt to sound intelligent?To you people that gave the book five stars...What are you THINKING?!?! I only wish Amazon.com had a zero stars rating instead of 1-5 so that I could give this book what it deserves."
1,Bad to the Bone,"Long winded, overlong, and overwrought series.I think many of the positive review are being posted by Jordan's publisher. Think about it......"
1,What was resolved?,"After reading all the reviews and reading the book twice, I only have a few things to say. Very little and i mean VERY LITTLE is resolved. The book is mostly filler with more random characters added with little or no mention of other more interesting characters....Padan Fain comes to mind. Most of the conclusions could have been deduced long before you read the book. Also, very little action took place, mostly endless talks that have been discussed in the other books at length over and over and over again. I have nothing against long stories or series, but I do expect that there would be more conclusions to previous plotlines/characters before new ones are added."
1,Climax?,"Alright, I have been reading this series for 6 or so years now. But really I am getting fet up, especially with the lackluster quality of the past two volumes. This book has the most lukewarm ending I have ever seen. Granted at least something happened in this book unlike number 10, but so little happened of consequence and so many sub-plots have just disappeared. At least by the sounds of it the next novel will finally get us to the last battle, and perhaps the end of the series. Let's hope this final book (if it is the final) will be more akin to the first three books or so."
3,Return to form or more of the same?,"It seems opinions are mixed as ever on Jordan's latest. After reading the first part of Knife of Dreams I wasn't really sure if it was more of the same or a return to form for Jordan. The closing sequences helped sway my decision on a return to form, at least the story looks to be going in the right direction. Rand, I miss you buddy."
4,It's drawing to an end,"I discovered this series while looking for something to occupy my time after reading the last book in ASOIAF. I am so glad I did. From The Power wielding Aes Sadai and Rand's Asha'men to the Aiel to the Two Rivers gang, Thom, Julian and all the other richly developed characters - I can't get enough. In KOD, as Tarmon Gaidan draws ever nearer, the story is all coming together. All the pieces of Robert Jordan's intricate puzzle that make up the WoT, create a picture of a time and world that defies imagination and draws you farther and farther in. Now - to decide what I'm going to read when I finish this........"
4,Very well written,"Mr Jordan has kept me interested in the whole series. This is an easy read, and the story moves along nicely. Very well written series, and the characters are fresh and real. Cant wait to start the next one."
5,Great read.,Good book in the series that helps move things along. Can't wait to find out what happens in the end.
2,Torture,"I just found out that this series will drag on for another three books. Are you f***ing kidding me? This book is better than the last few, but since it doesn't really resolve much it is not worth it. This series should come with a warning lable, ""Starts fast, gets you hooked, then sucks!"" I've been struggling to try and finish this wreck just to find out what happens; this latest development is the straw that broke the camels back, I'm done. I regret ever having picked up the EYE OF THE WORLD."
1,Why did I waste my time?,"I'm done with this series. I kept hoping I could tough it out until the end, but Mr Jordan's milking of what was originally a good story line has ruined it. In this case, wallowing through page after excruciating page of descriptions of characters who would come and go was too much. His readers, and his reputation, would have been better served if he had invested the time, and ink, in writing the ending to this run on tale."
2,Put down RJ and find Steven Erikson,"This was the fantasy series that got me started reading fantasy. I have to say I loved it from the start. However, as I have grown older and my tastes have matured I find RJ just does not cut it anymore. I don't know if he's just phoning it in, or if I just have different tastes now, but these last books just suck. I urge anyone else that feels this way to try Steven Erikson's The Tale Of The Malazan Book Of The Fallen. Gardens of the Moon, Deadhouse Gates, and Memories of Ice have recently been released in the US for the first time. These are great books. At least check out the reviews while your here at Amazon."
1,Please Make it stop!,"I have only browsed this book while at Barnes & Noble. But I will not buy it or any other Jordan book until the series is finished. My advice, find an author who finished a good series, like Raymond Feist, Roger Zelazny, or just reread some other greats. Lots of web discussions will fill you in on good SciFi/Fantasy. As for this drivel, you WILL waste precious hours and days of your life if you pick this up. Stay away at all costs! And watch out for George R R Martin too! I feel a Jordan in the making, although I must admit his world is far more compelling and exciting."
4,Makes up for Crossroads,"This reviewer has officially forgiven RJ for CoT.Nauseating as it was, it was in fact necessary for KoD to move as fast as it did.This book managed to salvage my interest in the Wheel of Time - once again, the waiting is the hardest part."
4,Much better than the last couple installments,"I don't really have too much to complain about in this volume. All the characters advance along nicely. It would be more acceptable if we don't have to wait so long for the next volume. The problem is that I forget some of the specifics dealing with each character and I don't recognize some of the minor characters' names at first. Normally I am against giving a ""back story"" to catch readers up to speed, but in the case of these installments it would probably be helpful."
2,Not that good,"Knife of Dreams is not a good book.I think that if If RJ had written an outline first and then cut out all the unnecessary words I would have liked the book a little more. Instead, all he had done is take a bits and pieces of his other books, add some half-explained sub-plots, and mash it all together into a 700+ page collection of repetition and fashion tips."
1,Don't waste your time,This is a warning to those who are considering starting to read The Wheel of Time. The first couple books were fantastic. Robert Jordan then proceeded to continue to add story lines and new characters till the point that when the next book (6 or 7)came out I couldn't remember who people where or why they were doing what they where doing. I quit at that point and from the reviews I read he continues to drag what began as a great epic through the mud.
1,What do a blimp and Robert Jordan have in common?.,"Robert Jordan is an overinflated and overrated (too high in altitude) gasbag, the contents of which are slowly leaking out. Will there be enough methane in there to complete this series? RAFO."
3,Actually pretty good,"Just on pure principle I object to giving RJ a five star for anything but Book 1, but this one's pretty good. It feels a forced at times, and the story can be difficult to follow since it's completely out of control, but I feel a sense of stress and impending confrontation. The girls continue to pull their hair, which is kind of funny, since physical 'tells' are so anti-Aes-Sedai... kind of like a world class poker player biting his fingernails. It just doesn't make sense.But all that being said, you're basically stuck reading the book since you've already read half the others. Plus, the end is near so you might as well brush up on things. I enjoyed it more than I expected."
3,How many more?,"Please believe me, if I tell you that I am a huge Wheel of Time fan...yet slowly but surely I'd like to see this series to come to an end. I admire Robert Jordan for penning one book chock-full of action and adventure after another, but number 11 has too many different storylines with too many different characters to be as enjoyable as, say, the first five books in the series. I am hoping that number 12 will finally bring a solution to the seemingly never-ending battles the primary characters have to fight - though the descriptions of those battles are now lacking the action-packed prose they used to have. It seems as if Mr. Jordan has run out of steam and the Wheel is slowing down... let's hope he can reclaim some of that pulse-driving energy for number 12. I'll buy it because I want to find out what happens - but I hope I won't be disappointed!"
3,Things are beginning to come to a close,Jordan has finally started to wrap up all of the unnecessary plot lines that he began 6-7 books ago. Hopefully the last three are tighter reads than we have had to get used to since this train started to come off the tracks. Knife of Dreams has me looking forward to them and I haven't been able to say that in a while.
4,Knife of Dreams,"Finally Jordan picked up the pace, as Tarmon Gaiden approaches and our hero's start to take injuries and more battles occur. It is bitter sweet knowing only two books remain. This decade long tale is almost to an end. Even though there are no beginnings or endings. But it is a Ending!!!!"
4,The Wheel of Time Continues...,"I had read all of Robert Jordon's Wheel of Time books, and could hardly wait to get my hands on this one. Mr. Sanderson has quite a reputation all on his own, and I thought it would be pretty good if he could pull off writing the succeeding (three) novels in order to finish the WOT series.At first as I began reading, I could definitely tell that there was a difference in style between Jordan and Sanderson, and then, after a short while reading it just didn't make any difference any more. It just seemed to ""blend"" well, for lack of a better way to put it.It was written well, covered and closed several story arcs (as promised), and kept closely enough to what I was used to with Robert Jordan's style to keep me interested, laughing, and turning to the next page."
2,Worst in series after Crossroads of Twilight.,"Jordan knows how to keep a good thing going, I guess. Only redeeming characters in this book are Mat as usual and shockingly Egwene. Unless for some strange reason you enjoy reading about all the side characters Jordan uses to fluff up the book."
2,Very Poor,"Once again, Jordan plods along with the plot line.This is an improvement over the last 2 installments, which were unreadable.However, the high point of the series was The Great Hunt, book 2.The Eye of the World was also excellent.This book does not materially advance the plot at all.And I'm quite sick of the rampant feminism that's becoming increasingly evident. Enough is enough...."
1,A warning,"I started reading this series when I was in college. I have since been through medical school, residency, and have been working for several years. I regret that I ever picked up the first book. I enjoyed the first three books, but always anticipated a grand finale that never came. Somewhere after the fifth book, I quit. No longer could I bear to hear about a female character tugging at her hair when she was angry or other such interminably repeated mannerisms. Because of this series, I promised myself I would never start a series that had not already been completed. In fact, I was so disappointed in the time I had wasted in reading these books, that I have read little fiction since. Let my experience serve as a warning to you: don't start this series until it is done and you know from others that it is worth the investment of time and money. I suspect the series will never be really done, and that even though a few plot lines will finish, we will see spin-offs of the secondary characters."
2,Who are these people????,"I've read all ten books before this one and I have no idea who 90 of these characters even are. I have to read this book with internet access in order to understand the story, SAD! How about a review or prologue that takes us back ten years?I love Jordan but this book is killing me to read."
3,Are we there yet?,"I think I'm going to take a nap...wake me up when we arrive.Seems to create more questions every book, are we going to get a 4 book sequel? Loved some of the earlier books but at this point really dragging on."
2,Another door stopper,"Wheel Of Time had the makings of a great series. From the third or fourth books, it went spiraling down the drain. Each book became bigger with little content and just dragging the plot. Jordan could have been too much in love with his story to finish it. Then there was a prequel. Ok, I can take that too. But when the prolouge for this book showed up for sale, I drew the line. It is clear this series stopped being a great story a long time ago and just a cash cow for author/publisher. I managed to get my hands on Knife of Dreams w/o paying for it and I can tell you it is same as the previous 6. For those who want to finish the story, just borrow. Not worth the price."
2,Spanking and Kissing Games,"A couple interesting things happened in this book, but overall, it was pretty bad. Way too many spanking of bottoms and kissing games. Way too many minor characters who bicker like children and the reader just doesn't care. Very juvenile characters make the battles and wars unbelievable. Robert Jordan, write a better book or I'll spank your bottom!"
2,"The Game Pieces Moved Around the Board, But No Real Action.","While I have committed numerous hours to the Wheel of Time Series I am a bit frustrated with the last few books. The characters have been fleshed out. Characters are traveling all over the place, yet it seems like they are getting no where. A few events that devotees to the series knew had to occur have occurred, but nothing really new. It's a lot of pages with no substantial outcomes. I read somewhere that there are 13 books due in the series, and do to past time invested in this epic, I will finish it. But I am not sure this book was worth the LONG wait between it and book 10."
2,"Picked up the pace, but lost it's heart","I need to go on record as saying that WOT has been my favorite series for several years now. In the first five books of the series Mr. Jordan was able to create real people that we cared about and could empathize with. While I found the pace of last few novels very frustrating, I was able to tollerate them because I still cared about most of the main players.In this book, Mr. Jordan has focused so much on making the story progress that he forgot to make us care about the people we have known for years. There were only two or three times in the entire book where I seemed to get lost in a characters emotions. I no longer feel like an extra participant in this adventure.I wouldn't care if WOT ended up being 15 books long, if the balance of story progression and detail were restored. If not, Mr. Jordan should stop here. If the final book is as heartless as this one, I won't be able to go back and read the series again."
4,getting back on track,the return of jordan's wayward story to the old days? not qute but it sure sets the stage for the next to come. also definately beter than the last 2 books in the series
3,Resentfully Good,"Yeah, so stuff actually happens in this book, and some plotlines get resolved. But not enough, and those that are resolved are often anticlimactic, especially for the length of time they've been building up. If the events of CoT and KoD had all been one book, with Elayne's plot taking up less than 5 chapters total, I would give that book 4 stars. As it is, I can't give this more than 3. But still, Jordan's tendency to cram a badly done RR Martin book (involving minor characters no one knows or cares about) into each WoT book seems to at least have subsided, if not vanished."
3,Make a statement,"If you are really dissatisfied with the previous books in this series, then instead of reading and reporting on your views of the book, don't buy it. I personally have not bought the last two and would not have read them except that they were gifts from a fellow WoT fan. I vowed a while back to not give Jordan any more of my money until the series is complete. I started this odyssey several years ago after book three came out. I devoured the first several books and re-read the series entirely before each new book. But after book 7 or so, I was so frustrated with the secondary story lines and the carrousel of characters that I simply stated that I would not buy any more books until the story is finished.If you want this series to end, then stop buying the books until it does. That will affect Tor and Jordan more than any other critique."
2,Another disappointing entry in the series,"I eagerly awaited ""Knife of Dreams"", anticipatiang a return to form for Robert Jordan. Something along lthe lines of ""The Great Hunt"" or even ""Lord Of Chaos"". Imagine how disappointed I was to find out that this book is as dull, poorly plotted and poorly written as the last four or five books in the series have been. Mr. Jordan seems to have lost his understanding of pacing and character development. As Tarmon Gaiden is looming, this should have been the most exciting chapter in the series. Instead the character stand around fuming about each other in exceedingly dull overly-detailed passages that lead absolutely nowhere. This book is a sever disappointment."
1,Is this really the same person who wrote the first books!?,"Ok... this book is garbage! Yet again I failed in my resolve to ignore the latest installment of this.. farce!Robert Jordan must be dead many years and some group of drone writers are trying to milk the readers for Tor books or something like that.The Prose is lousy, repetitive and even childish most of the time. The plot does not move (ok, perhaps in this book something happens, but still..) and Jordan still believes that bickering is actual intrigue!!If you want great prose, good plot and something actually happening read George Martin! That's a master writer!! And he doesn't even use the One Power to do it! ;-)"
4,jordan's best,this is the best of jordan's books so far. the plot is fast and the action is great. it also sets up the final book in the saga very well leaveing you wanting more.
1,Well...here we are...near the end...,"Well...finally we are nearing an end to this series...and I have but a few things to say.One...I own exactly three of the WOT series...the first three...and while I will be the first to admit that Jordan has painted a wonderful world with themes that I find very interesting...his writing...well...lets just say I'd rather read the back of a soup can instead.Two...to all of those who are giving one star and two star reviews and yet still reading this series...if you can't stand it any more...why are you still giving him your money? The best stand of refusal that you can give anyone,writer or otherwise, is to not give them your time and money.I've not read a single book...nor even touched one...since book three years and years ago...and I will not...simple as that. Though like some other reviewers I have to admit that reading some of these reviews is very entertaining."
5,Can you dig it,"OK. Here's the thing. This is a superior novel compared to the last three in the series. For that matter it a superior novel period. Anyone saying different is totally ridiculous. Jordan might not be Burroughs, Howard, or Ashton Smith, but in this day and age, who is? Give the man a break."
1,Something better,"Stop torturing yourself with the degraded prose, lifeless plot and predictable characters. Read Robin Hobb if you want mature fantasy that is beautifully written."
4,Don't Listen to the Haters,"I've been reading this series for years and this book is quite good, much better than the last few.If you've gotten a little bored by the series lately trust me you'll like this one and will be upset at the impending endless wait for the next novel."
1,Low Expectations,"After the last several books I'd bet that expectations are pretty low. Virtually anything with a discernable plot or without mountains of useless descriptions would be considered an improvement and given that in all honesty, not much is expected, it maybe that readers think any improvement-however miniscule-rates this book a masterpiece.Read George RR Martin instead."
1,snooze,Jordan is obviously milking his plotlines to get more money out of his publishing company and to get more of our money......not any more from me though. I would have more fun reading the encyclopedia then the last 6 books.
2,Arg!,I'd like to see Robert Jordan put to the question!!!Get on with it man. Decent book. He's infatuated with Mat and Tuon now. Rand appears on about 10 pages out of 800. Get it from the library and save yourself twenty bones.
4,"If you've read them all, go ahead and buy it","I don't have that much to add, most of the other reviews gave a pretty fair account of the book. It does move along much better than his past 3 or 4, but still gives the feeling that this could go on for at least three more books. If you have stuck it out this far, I don't think you will be too disappointed with this volume."
4,About Bloody Time!,"Finally. Jordan has gone and produced a book of high caliber for the first time in about *counts* 5 novels. Fires of Heaven and everything prior to that were excellent. Lord of Chaos dragged a bit, but was boosted by Crown of Swords, everything since then, crap.Now, at last, he seems to be getting back to the story that he started to tell so long ago. Plotlines advance, and at long last, things actually start happening again. There's even an UNEXPECTED twist or two. God forbid.All things considered, he's still got to dig himself out of that very large hole he's dug, but he's made a damned good start with Knife of Dreams"
3,a little more substance,After the last 3....this was a nice surprise. Hopefully gaining steam to the finale. I didn't think we would ever get here.
2,Long and drawn out,"I had to put this down 1/3 of the way through, and picked it up a year later just to be done with it. I kept going because I wanted to get to a book that Brandon Sanderson wrote for WOT. Now that I just finished the 13th book, I must say I'm happy I finished book 11, Knife of Dreams. Books 12 and 13 are so much better and the pace is that of a normal novel - not the slow, drudgery of the last few by Jordan - I mean really; must I know about the detail of every freaking dress?!Jordan, rest his soul, was mired in minute and unnecessary details - and if he mentioned 'bosom' once more, I think I would've puked. We all know about that fetish, or fixation.Sanderson's take over of the series is a massive improvement. So for all of you out there who felt about the last few books Jordan wrote, take heart and press on. Am looking forward to the last book."
2,A Serious Let Down,"I have been invested in this series since I first picked up a trade paperback copy of The Eye of the World back in 1990. After a great and enthralling start to a series with such potential, this one was like lugging through a dense jungle while wearing an 80-pound pack on your back and having no machete.The characters didn't evolve much, if any. The story didn't evolve much, if any. A very unmemorable experience.I have heard from several people that the series has been reinvigorated with Brandon Sanderson finishing it up, and I certainly hope so. KoD, however, was very cumbersome, but it does not diminish my feelings for the beginning of this series and my interest in the characters."
4,Jordan does it again,An excellent book that continues a brilliant series by a writer at the peak of his powers. A shame there will be no more to come.
1,"Slow, Boring and Annoying","Slow, Boring and Annoying. The best way to read these books is to skim the pages. If you do happen to get lucky and run into some action, you can always stop and read it thoroughly. Of course, I'll read the next (and hopefully last) book when it comes out. I've gone this far and would like to know what happens. I am not excited about it though, just curious. It's unbelievable how slow and plodding this series has become. Plus most of the main characters are really annoying and fight like they are 12 year olds. Even the Forsaken are annoying. And I would have liked to see more of Shadar Haran in the series."
3,Its a start back to the beginning,"Thank god that we don't have to read another book with chapter's focused on how the women's hair is fixed, or the cut of there dress', or there insignificant thoughts about all the other women characters that only sets the stage for another boring chapter. Jordan finally gets back to his main characters and moves the plot along. although excrutiatingly slowly but looks to be some hope for an ending in this decade possibly. I mean I only started reading these books in something like the early to mid 90's and here we are ten years or more later and I am still waiting for the conclusion. I have gone from beginng high school reading these books to my first gray hairs{possibly waiting for the outcome of this series} and still going with and end in sight but not in reach. I can't give up now. I just think Mr. Jordan that you need to reread the Eye of the world and the Hunt for the horn, and try to get the old storyline back where you had me hooked after the first pages."
2,"Why, Robert, why...","This book is terrible. There have been bad books in the series, but this one tops my list because it marks a huge shift. Faithful main characters are turned into archetypes. Plotlines are not only predictable, they are broadcast, you know, just in case you miss the subtle hints. The male female dynamic has been totally obliterated, and that was one of my favorite parts. Even Cadsuanes character has been generic'd into shrewish stereotype. And what's up with all the exclamation points? Stephen King did this same thing to me one time. He ruined The Dark Tower series. Everything was going fine until that pink book came out...Quit now and keep your fond memories."
2,Kill me pleassse!,"I waited for this book to come out to take on the plane with me overseas. It was so boring and went NOWHERE that i shoved it in the luggage department and watched ""the longest yard"" 3 times.I couldnt put the first 6 books down! I cared about everyone but now there are so many that I couldn't care less about any of them. There is a group of us that are reading Jordan's series and we are drawing straws to see who will buy the next book and then JUST TELL US WHAT FINALLY HAPPENS!!!"
3,Better than the last few. . .,"Okay, I have to admit that the only reason I really bought this book is because I have read all (yes even the last few truly horrible) volumes in this series. It's at the point now where I just want to finally find out what happens!! Anyway, this book is admittedly better than the last few that Mr. Jordan has fed us to keep his coffers full, but is still lacking when compared to the first volumes of the series. To any new readers of Mr. Jordan's work- be wary because it is going to be a very long and often very frustrating haul to get this far along. For everyone else who has stuck it out through the whole series, this book finally starts wrapping up a few story lines that have been drawn out WAY too long. Pretty much all of the sub-plots are finally moving forward, too. Happy reading!"
1,A corpse,"This series became a bloated, decaying corpse swarming with maggots already a dozen of years ago.Objectively it is not that the litterary ""performance"" in this thing deserves 1 star.But it is that even if you find a nice golden ring on a corpse, it stays that it is a corpse.I simply don't care about anything that may or may not happen to anybody.I am fed up with Rand's idiocy, with Perrin's obsessions, with Tuon's arrogance, with Elayne's and Egwene's cluelessness.If anything I hope that the Dark One will recover some brains (up to now his IQ is about the one of an oyster) and sweep the floor up with the Rand's company.Another Breaking on the way but this time the destruction should be complete - nothing and nobody has earned the right to survive.Least of all the WoT series.The corpse became now so ugly and smelling that the only thing it deserves is to be buried.And fast."
2,An improvement over terrible still makes for a bad read,"All but the most avid fans of this series agree that the last book in the WOT was the worst. Calling it merely terrible doesn't begin to describe how awful that installment was. And yes, this was better. A little.Then why do I still read these things? It's kind of like a train wreck. You just have to see how bad it can get.And I refuse to pay for this trash, as I get my copies through the library.Others have already listed the faults of this novel, so I won't bore you with listing them again. For those who are not critical in their reading, go ahead and give it four or five stars. But if you expect something more for your money than the hack prose supplied by Mr. Jordan, you will be very disappointed.One last point. Given the spanking fetish Mr. Jordan has developed, I'm thinking the Last Battle might be fought by naughty boys and girls armed with switches rather than with the One Power."
2,Jordan Haiku,"Hard men are stone facedWomen pull their hair and poutWe get it, okay?Another one:ten thousand pagesseventeen years to write this?end the series now!"
2,Too many unintersting characters/plotlines,"Reading Knife of Dreams after going through the same experience as most Jordan readers have, euphoria at the first five to seven books and then apathy and disappointment (maybe it has something to do with age? I was 16 when I read the first five books and am now 27), I realise that there is only one interesting plotline in the book and that is the Rand/Lews Therin plot. All the rest are just predictable plotlines (Perrin chasing Faile, Elayne competing for the throne etc) with boring one-dimensional characters. It is very boring and you keep hoping against hope that Moridin or Demandred finally get their act together and kill some of them but of course this is Jordan and, unfortunately, not one of the major characters on the good side can die."
2,Editor?,Get this man an editor! I think that one huge problem with some of the sucessfull authors is that they seem to be able to ignor their editors. There were about 300 pages that could have been trimmed from this book. Repeated and lengthy discussions of unstrurdy chairs and page long dissections of facial expressions hardly make for compelling reading. Get on with the story! One of the jobs of a good editor is to trim the fat and make the books more readable. Where is Jordan's editor?
1,"Almost over, whew!","The best thing that can be said of this novel is that this behemoth of a series is nearing an end. Some reviewers of this and the past 5-6 books in this series continue to sing its praises. I wonder if they read the same book that I did. This is the 11th book (yes, 11th!) in a series which was good for about the first 4-5 books. Somewhere along the line Mr. Jordon fell in love with his own prose and excruciatingly complex plot and character development. I hung around this long in the hopes that the magic of the first couple books would re-emerge. I don't see that happening and thus I will not be reading the 12th or so on."
1,"Better than the last 4, but only by one step.","The intricate web should have reached an end ages ago.Ta'veren are still just whiney little boys that don't understand women. One would hope that after months within the storyline some growth would take place, but after thousands of pages it's still just time wasted between boy becomes hero and boy fights evil."
3,what's with the cover art?,"Enough people have provided thoughtful and well written reviews of this newest installment of the WOT books for everyone to get the gist of things. This book is an improvement over the last (a phone book would be an improvement over the last!) and yet still isn't as good as the first books of the series.What I want to know is what is up with the cover art? Rand looks like Danny Bonaduce for crying out loud, and I'm talking Danny Bonaduce before rehab. Who is this Darrell Sweet guy related to, or who is he doing at TOR to keep his job as a cover artist??? I know high school art students who can draw better than this. His people are out of proportion and look so amatuerish it is embarassing."
3,Average addition to the series,"Whenever a new book in this series comes out, I keep on thinking of that movie Weekend at Bernies, and Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman spend the movie dragging around the dead guy in an attempt to convince everyone he's still alive. Sometimes I wonder if the publishers at Tor are doing the same with Mr. Jordan.This book wraps up Perrin's journey to rescue Faile, Elayne taking control of Andor, and Mat marrying Tuon in a less than exciting fashion. Rand battles a Forsaken, if you can call what occurs a battle. This book is hardly worth purchasing in hardcover, unless you can get a used copy for dirt cheap. Otherwise, I'd suggest waiting for mass market.Final review: Average."
2,Same old Jordan,"I started reading the WOT series when Jordan came out with book #6 (i.e. I read 1-6 and had to wait a year for #7, a story familiar to WOT fans). The books have been generally getting worse with time and I would have to say that this one falls into the same category.The book is over 700 pages, but only 100 of them contain real plot and development. Almost right away I had to employ my WOT strategy of skimming through all of the fluff like how moody someone was today or the wonderful blue sky out in Andor that day and stop to examing the plot. The plot however, looks a bit hurried, almost as if Jordan wants to finish another book this year, but doesn't know what to put in it, so he throws around fluff and then has a paragraph of two on some closure. Well, to the true WOT fans at least there are some long awaited closures in this one.Till #12...."
4,Book 11,The story is still too slow in developing. Maybe the last book will finally clear up all the unanswered questions.
4,Fighting evil between spankings...,"Honestly, how do these people have time to prepare for Tarmon Gaidon between all the spanking and flogging? Does Robert Jordan think that this is what women do when they're alone together? I haven't re-read this series for a few years, but I really think that Jordan amped up the spanking frequency quite a bit in KoD. I guess Cadsuane spanking Rand is supposed to make it equal opportunity. Otherwise, this book was pretty good, although I was hoping for a few more developments. Things did happen, just not very many, and none of the really juicy story lines developed much at all. I have been buying these books in hardcover as soon as they come out and I probably will continue to do so because I am an optimist, I guess. I just hope that one of the future books will make me glad I did."
1,Whats the point !,Loved the first 5 books and couldnot wait for hte next one. Series got worse as i could not finish the 5th book.Read the first 4 and dream the rest of the story. I plead with Robert Jordan to finish the series and start something new !!I never read past the 5 properly- only scanned the other bookshmmmRead a fantastic series like the dragon lance chronicles and test of twins - two fantastic trilogies that actually have an ending !!!these are by Margaret Weis and Tracy HickmanThoroughly recommended 5/5OH YEAH back to jordan - forget about this book - READ IT ONLY WHEN HE HAS A DEFINITE FINISH FOR THE SERIES !!!
1,Worst One Yet,"I was excited when I read some reviews about things picking up in this book.The fours and fives given to this book make me shake my head.90% of this book is about bratty women who pout, frown, glare, and raise their eyebrows at each other. Really. If you don't believe me, just open up a random page in this book and I guarantee that you will find an unlikable woman acting like a brat. I do wish Elayne would kick the bucket - she is such a spoiled little brat.Oh well, just one more book to suffer through."
2,"High expectations, Low satisfaction","This book was a big disappointment. A lot of clothing descriptions and not much substance. This book could have been edited down to about 250 pages. Can we ever get this story to some sort of conclusion? After all these years of waiting and reading, enough already!"
1,Blood and Bloody Ashes!!!,"Wow! Blood and Bloody Ashes! I have to say I really enjoyed this book. We get to hear from most all of the characters we all have come to love. I remember when you would not hear from a favorite character for a book or two. Now it seems we get a little from every minor character Jordan has ever created. As far as the plot line goes it actually advances! Imagine any other author daring to advance a plot! Overall I really loved this book and can't wait till the next one.Despite the lack of details in this review, You know I MUST read WoT, and especially this latest book, since I typed ""blood and bloody ashes""! I'll type it again to prove I have read this book.Blood and bloody ashes! Great book, just like the first 3 books, and a battle just like great Dumai Wells! Everyone who doesn't vote 5 stars hasn't even read this book!/hype"
3,Better but still not there yet!,"The wait, oh the wait. And finally when I get it it is actually better than the last couple. However, Having waited so long for it, I found that after reading the first chapter, I had to go back and reread several of the more pitiful ones preceding it just to remember who was who, what they were doing and why. Not the main characters to be sure but the mulititued of supporting characters.Is this over complicated or what? Now I like a convoluted plot with many characters but this series is getting way too many, maybe he should have a cataclysmic disaster which kills off half of the supporting cast so all we have to deal with are a few main players.Better but still not worth more than a three star rating."
2,"Better, but not worth buying the hardcover",Sure there was some progression to the plot but what has become stunningly apparent is that Jordan can no longer write a battle scene. Every battle involving the principal three protagonists was short and lacked strategic thought or twists. Perrin's in particular was about as anticlimactic a battle as I could have imagined having waited 3-4 books to see it come to resolution. Jordan has proven himself a great describer of scenery and an abysmal storyteller.
2,Most Disappointing Series Ever,What started out as one of the best series I have ever read has quickly mired itself in quicksand. The pace slows to a crawl as usual and the book is mostly just bickering and banter with very little action. Once again i find myself skipping entire chapters because there is no enjoyment in reading them. There is no main thread to follow and nothing to miss. In fact I have often skipped chapters in his last 4 books and it has made no difference in my ability to follow the story because I haven't missed anything because so little actually happens. While I admit I am a sucker for punishment becuae I did buy the book in hopes that he would return to his original form but i was disappointed again. My wish is that the next book is the last so that we can finally put the readers and this series out of its misery. While I may borrow it just to read the conclusion I know I will never buy any new series written by Jordan again.
2,"Not Great, but not as bad as Crossroads","Just finished reading Knife of Dreams. I was a little nervous when my husband surprised me with a copy. I didn't think book 10 was all thatgreat, and I didn't even bother picking up the prequel based on all the horrible reviews it received. In my opinion it's not as bad as book 10, but not as good as Fires of Heaven, The Great Hunt, etc.I enjoy reading about Mat's courtship with Tuon, so I especially found those few chapters intriguing, but aside from that nothing inspiring happened. Perrin rescues Faile. Who didn't see that coming? Same with Elayne and her quest for the throne. Even my husband can't believe even I find her character extremely annoying."
1,The Wheel of Time has fallen off the Vehicle of Good Storytelling,"What is the story that is being told here? How many unnecessary sideplots and diversions are there going to be? Is there actually a story in here or is it simply a chronicle of events?In my opinion, this story is suffering from too many details, too many characters, too many sideplots and not enough editing. I have lost complete interest in these initally captivating characters and concepts.As long as hardcore fans keep slavishly snatching up the next installment, it will continue to be a money maker for Tor. My hope is that they use this profit to invest in new authors and series (and editing staff).I realize this review is harsh but there are literally thousands of books in this genre that are more engaging."
3,going somewhere?,"I waited 2 yrs for a new installment. KoD is better than the last few, but to be honest RJ seems to be more lost in this story than the readers. This installment starts to bring it back together. to finish in one book...which I understand RJ said he would, it seems, he will have to dumb it down quite a bit. What will be left out, what will be ignored, and what totally preposterous mechinisms will have to be used to tie it up? This series hasn't gone anywhere in the last 4 books. this one finally gets it going again, but, I don't think RJ even knows where. He seems to have written himself into a corner."
2,Great to Skim,"I read a few reviews here and just decided to read KoD at the bookstore (I'm a poor student don't be harsh). I was able to finish the book over the weekend, and if I had the money I'd be pissed if I spent money for the hardcover. I will say though that thanks to Mr. Jordan, I am now able to skim rather quickly, and I'm hoping this ability will help with my studies. Anything even remotely related to the main plot could have been completed in a chapter or two. Anyway, if you're poor like me, or even if you're not, you're not missing out on much with this book."
2,Soap Opera in Book Format,"Welcome back to the 'As the wheel turns' and boy does it turn and churn.We are back on familiar grounds here. What started as a great fantasy series has turned to a cash cow for the author and frankly reminds me of the Rocky series with Silvester Stalone albeit in book format.This book is a mess. Nothing is what it seems anymore but one thing I can say, it is much better to live in Mr. Jordan's world than ours because, no one truly dies, if you die, you come back and back again, everyone of the bad guys is the sameI wish Mr. Jordan started to realize that he is now wasting his and my time both"
3,"Better than the last one, but...","I am a long time fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.I am a long suffering reader of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.While Knife of Dreams is far more entertaining and engaging than the previous, tedious, and boring Crossroads of Twilight, I state the following for your consideration:The series plots finally move forward, i.e. something happens besides women smoothing their dresses and having tea.The myriad of subplots and plethora of confusing names continues; I find myself in need of a storyboard!There is no Knife of Dreams!?!?! WTH?I still, begrudgingly, look forward to the next book. If this had been another Crossroads, I would have offered TOR a real editor. You'd think they could find one."
3,Wheel of Time book 11 audiobook,Antoher great performance by Micheal kramer and his wife Kate Reading! I love these audiobooks. Shipping and delivery of this product reduced the rating because it was over two weeks late in arriving.
3,"Some improvement and interesting moments, but still too slow","The book could have been half its size, but it is a definite improvement over the last few installments. If only there werent so many characters, it might have been possible to become really absorbed into it."
1,this book is crap!,"why are you still reading this series? all jordan has ever done is rip off other authers. take a little bit of dune, a touch of lord of the rings, completely steal every good idea from cook's black company and then take the dragon rises and pretend its yours. what a hack. i could stand the first several books, but now jordan is just reaching for dollars. i heard his next book is called "" a wallet looms darkly"""
3,book 11 of a probable 8,"Haven't read it yet, but I will. I will NOT buy it. The library will do that for me. I will never buy another Jordan book. I will read this one (and give it 3 stars sight unseen) for two reasons. One, because I enjoyed the beginning of this series immensely and want to see where it ends up. And two, because I want to see just how much ""filler"" Jordan can work into this series to lengthen it--thereby stealing more of the paying public's money. He's expert at it. If you don't believe me, go back and read 5-10 again concentrating not on the story but on the writing. See how much useless dreck there is. According to the jacket cover of book 3 (or maybe 4), this series was ""a probable 8 books."" Now we're up to 11 and still no end. Each hardcover book costs HOW much? Do NOT be surprised if the almighty dollar drags this story past a book 12. Can we count to 15? How about 20? Will you still buy if it goes that far? Sad to say, but you probably will."
1,"Please stop, PLEASE","Somebody please stop Jordan. This is simply awful and has been awful for so many previous volumes.Whoever out there is buying these books: Please, stop as well - it only encourages Jordan to write more of this schlock. For crying out loud, these books come close to being nothing but the mindless killing of innocent trees."
5,Knife dreams,"Super book and on time, now waiting on number 14th.Numerous plot lines advance and the writing shows the effect of a full cycle."
3,"Better, but not like the good old days","Jordan's slower and longer than an ice age series improved with this latest installment and makes me hope he actually has a true destination. This would have been a teriffic 8 book set, but it has been streched into four good and seven drugging novels which leave you wondering what you originally saw in the series. No one is the same which I guess is good as far as character growth and development, but along with meeting the plethora of new characters in each book, you have to relearn the old ones as well."
2,The last track of the gravy train,"I, like so many who have stuck with this series past book 6, am only in it to know how it ends. Knife of Dreams, the 11th book in this strange journey of Robert Jordan, brings me no closer to the state of serenity that (after book 9) I feel I've rightly earned. To that end, I closed the book and asked myself what it was that kept me reading this trash, book after book, wasting countless amounts of currency just to keep abreast of the hemorrhaging plotlines. Was it the random paragraphs of detailed description about a culutre that Jordan kills off in one chapter? Was it the obsessively repetitive passages devouted to the spanking of Egwene al'Vere? Or was it some sick, twisted hope inside of me that somehow Rand al'Thor would keel over dead and Mat Cauthron would ditch princess Toun and go back to the dicing and womanizing that made him likeable to me in the first place?None of the above. I just want this series over."
2,I expected more...,"I really believed after the disaster that was CoT, that Jordan would write a better book than this (see books 1-5). Maybe my opinion is skewed, since I read this book right after reading George Martin's Feast for Crows (got it early from the UK Amazon site).Pretty much agree with what all the other reviews complain about: Perrin/Faile story is long and basically I don't care anymore, liked Mat/Tuon's story, WAAAY too many pages about Egwene/Nynaeve/Elayne.My biggest peeve is why he keeps writing about Rand/Perrin/Mat not understanding women and vice versa. Seriously, what is up with that? Didn't he write enough about that garbage in the last couple books? Who gives a #%$@# about men and women not understanding each other? It's not a self-help book, fer christ's sake.Sorry I had to vent like that.Anyways, I'll probably read the last book just to see what happens."
2,"A little better, but still sub par","Well the book was loads better then the last, but it still wasnt even close to the begening of the saga. It was nice to see some of the plot lines finishing up, what took 3 or 4 books could have easily been done in 2 chapters.. there is still no end in site, though atleast there are some allusions to ""an eventuel end""all and all I stopped getting mad a few books ago, I continue to read with the small hope that they will eventuelly turn back around. I just wonder if this man realizes what he has done to his once great saga."
1,Jordan in true form....AGAIN!,"Bravo Jordan!! You have once again crammed 450 pages of over descriptive, drawn out, long-winded JUNK into a 760 page book. I am assuming that the final installment of this series will be about 1100 pages and the characters will mill around moving about 6 feet until the last 50 pages when you will get into a rush to tie up all the loose ends? I haven't seen a worse book since Simon R Green wrapped up the Deathstalker series in Deathstalker Coda. That waste of money was not fit for toilet paper. I have very small expectations for the final book and will only buy it when it hits paperback."
3,What has Jordan been reading lately....,"I, like many others, have read each of the WOT books, and like several other reviewers agree that the first 4-5 books were wonderful. BUT, the last several books he has vomited up are TERRIBLE, lacking the fast pace and excitement the first had. Though book 11 (by the way, no one should EVER have to go 11 books into one story) was better than the last few, I think I have a good idea why it has been taking so long for Mr. Jordan to get these out... Did any one else notice how many references were made to lesbianism and spankings in this book??? It leads me to think that all that time on his computer late at night wasn't necesarily spent writing this novel. I think he has a little bit of frustration he needed to work out, and he used this last book as a conduit to vent that frustration.Anyway, like I said, the book is definitely better than the last couple, but miles from the first several books."
4,Ok for Ol' Schoo' Listeners,"Good stuff and nostalgic....however, I wish they would have had the extended version of everything (specifically Royal Cash's Radioactive). Oh well...On a whole, a good list of stuff for the high side 30-somethings to remember their youth!"
3,"In some ways, the best of the worst","Anyone familiar with my postings knows that I am an absolute HATER of the high-tech drek and computerized synthesizer-banging garbage that flooded the airwaves and dancefloors as well as assaulting eardrums and good taste in the early 80s. But there are a few good tunes here. Royal Cash's ""Radio Activity"" was to me the best of this genre because as much as I despise synthesized music, this was a clever, catchy, and funky little tune filled with funny catch-phrases (who that-who that-who that trying to be bad) and comedy routines (""I have an electronic stereo..it has dolby noise reduction..."" if you remember the tune from 1983-84, I need not say more). Some decent rap from Whodini is on ""5 minutes of Funk"" and a little bit of good R&b is on Skyy's ""Call Me"" and ""Walking on Sunshine,"" but as far as ""Shackles on My Feet,"" ""Tour De France,"" etc. ad nauseum...YECCHH!!! They can keep that!"
5,Fits perfectly on my Lexus IS-F,I bought this for my Lexus IS-F. It fits exactly to the windshield size. It does knock the rear view mirror out of place when you are placing this or removing it. Storing it is not very easy since the included velcro tie is too short. I had to get another piece of velcro to extend this to make rolling it up easier.
5,Buy this and Vol. 2 also,"We love Peanuts. As boomers we grew up with what is now called ""Classic Peanuts."" Both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 are well done. This collection should bring a smile to any Peanuts' fan."
4,Almost excelent,It should be a 5 star product if on disc 2 they could add maybe an extra chapter due that is too short with only 2 chapters and a brief story about Woodstock. Otherwise is really good.
4,"Great, except...","I was really disappointed by the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. The one on this disc is not the one they show on TV and the whole point of buying the set, at least for me, was to be able to watch the TV specials without the commercials. Therefore, I still ended up having to watch the Thanksgiving one on TV, because this one was not the one they usually show. I love it otherwise...but that was a little bit disappointing."
4,Very informative,"This work is a very extensive examination of the tactics used by Arab small units. It goes into vivid detail about their ambush techniques as well as other aspects of how they fight. The only serious issue I have with it is it is difficult to read at times. Mr. Poole uses many quotes especially block quotes which are very useful and come from legitimate sources. However, these quotes hurt the flow of the book and make it very choppy to read. If you can work past this flaw though it is a great resource."
3,Pooles View on contemporary guerilla warfare - muslim as it happens..-,"This book deals with - as the title says - tactics of muslim guerilla warfare. It focuses on contemporary warfare with some historical flashbacks, with the aim of explaining certain specific issues in the guerilla tactics.Reading the introduction I must confess I was bit confunded - [...]. I have no reason to doubt the factual material in the text - there's lots of interesting notes and references in the text. I do not however like references to ""God and his love of America"" or how the author has turned the West bank and the Gaza strip into ""Palestinian-Controlled Areas within Israel"", just to mention a few examples. [...]. Images in the book are not high-end, to say the least. But if you can live with these short-comings, and are interested in the topic, the book is worth reading."
5,Another life-saver by John Poole,"Tactics of the Crescent Moon is a survival guide for all those people that are involved in the current conflicts.Reading this book gives you a unique insight in the way the asymmetric or guerilla opponent thinks and acts.This book again, as all of John Poole's writing, calls out to the reader to use his best weapon - the brain.With all the examples and bits of information in the numerous references you can learn to identify the tell tale signs of militant Muslim action.This will help to save lives.This book is useful to everyone;policy and doctrine makers, tacticians, planners, trainers, commanders and leaders and most important of all - to soldiers.In fact I thought this book to be so current that I ordered additional copies to send to our troops that are deployed in areas where the described combat methods are used."
3,I Gave This to a Friend Joining the Army,"I gave it to him so he'll be more likely to live if he is shipped to Afghanistan. Here's what I wrote on the inside cover:Much of what's in this book must be taken with a grain of salt, not all is well supported. However, it's the best discussion of the tactics and military tradition of the warriors you may be fighting I've seen. In particular, make sure your unit knows how to handle a U shaped ambush and a fake retreat. His ideas about infiltrating a position using burkas for disguise might work very well. Good luck."
1,A real stretch,"I read this book shortly after it came out and before my third deployment to Iraq. It relies heavily on specious arguments to make the case for such tactics as the Arab use of magic hand gestures (really). Poole's early books, The Last Hundred Yards and One More Bridge to Cross, were pretty good although still short of academic quality. The quality kept slipping in subsequent books. By the time we get to Crescent Moon, the whole thing is very poorly argued and not worth your money except, I guess, for use as an historical artifact. I would not buy this or any of his books written since."
4,Excellent Insight on Militant Tactics,"As a student of Middle Eastern Culture and the Arabic language as well as a someone who intends on entering the military upon graduating, I find this book very enlightening as to the tactics of muslim militants. While some explainations are very brief the book covers many different aspects of terrorist methodology. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in terrorism or 4th generation warfare."
4,After reading this book I sent it to my old ROTC school,"I would highly encourage any person who is Battalion staff or lower to read this book. All Army and Marine personnel should read this book on the jet flying them to Iraq or Afghanistan. This book will give a typical soldier or marine a good snap shot of how the Eastern combat mind thinks. Also, unlike much propaganda to the contrary, the Islamic soldiers fight using Eastern techniques. There is more hand-to-hand fighting than in the past. American's just can't call in their massive fire support because the targets may not be easy to hit.This book is great for privates, sergeants, lieutenants, and captains. I don't know if the advice will be taken if it's read at the level of battalion or above. That is where the ""rubber no longer meets the road"". The staff disconnect from the soldiers begins.For all war fighters this book is a must read. All ROTC departments, Marine, and Army infantry should have this book as required reading."
4,great window ladder,Ibought two of these window ladders. They hook over the window and are easy to deploy. This was bought in case of emergency. These are fairly inexpensive and can save your life. Your second story bedroom should have two separate ways to escape in the case of fire. If not I would recommend getting a ladder of this type.
1,Not Great Product,Ordered 2 of these ladders and am sending them back. The ladders are heavy and combersome. Ladders seem too complicated especially if needed in an emergency situation. The hooks have to be pulled apart so it adds an extra step. The hooks are heavy and hard to get even to latch onto a window seal. The actual ladder rungs fall out of their packaging and are heavy. So getting the ladder rungs out the window could be troublesome. We have an X-it ladder and I was hoping to be able to get away with using these cheaper ladders in some other needed areas. The X-it ladder I have is a much better product. It is light weight. My kids can lift it. The ladder rungs stay neatly packaged until deployed. The hooks that secure to the window seal are simple. Guess I will have to spend the money and get more X-it ladders.
4,As described,"The ladder is well constructed, and I won't be scared to use it. For larger individuals, do take note of the width. 4 stars given because it tangles somewhat easily, but it's not bad."
4,Great Escape Method,"We were concerned that getting out of the second story of our house could be an issue in the event of a fire. I know these ladders have been around for years, but I was always sceptacle about their use. Amazon had one listed as a special deal, and that pushed me towards trying it. The ladder is small when not in use. It hooked up to my second story window ledge fine. It may be a little scary using it, but not as scary as a fire. It looks like it would save the lives of my family so it is not sitting in its original box right under our escape window."
4,Ladder,Construction looks strong and the concept seems relatively simple. Hope I never have to use it but if I need it I will be glad that I have it. No two story jumping for me!
4,Dee in LA,This ladder is very compact and fits neatly on a bottom shelf in our guest room. Appears very sturdy. Hope we never need to use it.
3,"Essential, but not easy","I have taken this product out once and let my son practice with it. That went reasonably well, though without practice, it would be very hard to do this right in an emergency. Repacking the ladder was a huge hassle. The directions were very clear, but didn't seem to apply to the same ladder that I was handling. I finally got it repacked and placed it in my son's room, but the difficulty in packing makes me hesitate to practice again, even though I know that would be a good idea."
2,Not good for kids,"This is not a good escape ladder for kids. We have a 6 year old daughter who was not strong enough to lift this heavy ladder up to the window, unfold the cumbersome hooks, and then throw the ladder part out the window. It is hard and awkward even for an adult to do this let alone a child.Once the ladder is hooked on the window sill, you have to lean waaayyy out the window to pull the release tab, risking falling out the window to do this, especially if you are a vertically challenged.Once you pull the tab, the ladder is supposed to neatly fall to the ground without getting caught up on itself. Wrong. The ladder gets so tangled that it would require you to go 4 or 5 steps down, untangle, go 4 more steps, untagle, etc.I do not recommend this ladder."
1,Very difficult to use and climb on safely.,"I tested this item from our second story window as soon as I got it home. First of all the rungs became entangled with the nylon straps when I released the velcro handle, had to pull the ladder up to correct it. The way it hooks over the window sill was not sturdy at all, and tended to shift dangerously when weight was put on the first rung. Just placing my foot on the first rung was a challenge in daylight with no emergency occurring, it just doesn't protrude from the wall far enough. I am athletic and of normal height/weight, but clambering down this ladder had me fearing a fall and I crawled back through the window before I got below the second rung. I returned the product to the store and will have to find some other way to egress our home in an emergency."
5,escape ladder,"Seems sturdy, hopefully I'll never have to actually use it but at least I feel better knowing it's there and ready in case of emergency!"
4,There is a God,"Karen Wheaton is a remarkable Praise and Worship Leader. Karen ushers in the praise like no other. She is an inspirational Evangelist, who has been inspired by God to assist in the ushering of the Holy Ghost! The song (Can I get a Witness) ignited my feet and lifted my spirit to praise. I invite you to indulge and be blessed by this powerful move in psalms (songs) by the Holy Spirit."
1,Karen Wheaton Freemason,She is posing in a masonic position with the two pillars behind her. Don't buy this c.d. it is cursed!
2,Could be better,"the vid had some decent parts, but overall was boring....seemed like some sort of lifestyle documentary on these guys. Next time i say show more action and crazy off the chain daredevil stuff, and leave the documentary film school stuff to those specials on A&E."
2,TOO MANY WANKSTAS,"THIS DVD IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE(IM SAYING THIS CAUSE I GOT IT FOR 99 CENTS) I WATCHED IT A WHILE AGO AND HAVEN'T BOTHERED TO LOOK AT IT SINCE SO I'LL TRY TO GIVE AN ACCURATE REVIEW. ASIDE FROM THE BLACK DUDES IN MIAMI AND SOME OF THE GUYS UP NORTH THERES A BUNCH OF POSERS RUNNING AROUND WITH GUNS, PITS AND MEAN LOOKS ON THEIR FACE. THIS UPSETS ME GREATLY BECAUSE OF CLOWNS LIKE THIS MAKING BIKERS AND EVEN MORE SO PITS LOOK LIKE TROUBLE(MAYBE IM JUST BITTER BECAUSE I'VE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE WITH THERE DISTORTED OUTLOOK ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THANX TO ""TOUGH GUYS"" LIKE THESE). I WAS RAISED IN SOUTH AFRICA AROUND REAL BADASS BIKERS...STICK TO STUNTING BEFORE YOU RUN INTO THE REAL THING. PICK UP ANY OTHER STUNT DVD AND IT WILL BE BETTER."
1,Water Damage should be humidity damage,"I purchased the one year warranty for my iPod touch 1st generation, and after about 6 months it would no longer connect or charge unless held to the cable with rubber bands. So I send off my ipod to apple and they tell me that they won't repair it under warranty because of water damage, and they had the guts to tell me that they could repair it for $229! Now I travel around the Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, and Texas coast areas for work and I reach some humid areas but I've never had another electronic device utterly fail just from humidity. The ipod never touched water except what was in the air. DO NOT BUY!"
4,Undecided,"I have not had anything go wrong with my iPod hardware or software wise, so i really do not know what to say. The one thing I will say is that I sold my 30gb iPod on eBay when I heard about the ipod touches and the sale included this warranty. Apple was very helpful in facilitating the Apple Care transfer. The guy who bought it recieved the new agreement with his name on it three days after I emailed Apple about the transfer.I am only giving this four stars because I have not needed it for repair purposes."
4,Unable to track shipping,"I ordered an Apple Care protection plan. It arrived shortly after it was due. However, I was unable to track where the shipment was while I was waiting using the USPS tracking system."
2,Lost a year's service to Amazon typo,"The detailed description for the plan says- Extend repair and telephone support coverage of your iPod to three yearsI thought Apple had become generous but once I received it with my iPOD, I found it's still just one additional year, not two. Apple confirmed that the three years is a typo. My last iPOD needed to be replaced twice so the extended service is a must even if it's just for one year."
4,AppleCare Protection Plan for iPod touch,The price was $10.00 cheaper than Apple store. Delivery was prompt. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 was because of the installation problem. I had to contact Apple tech support to fix the problem with registration. It was a problem with registering from North Carolina according to tech support.
2,"Stylish, but ouch!","I wore these shoes for the first time today, and my feet are paying for it. I have never wore a pair of clogs that hurt as badly as these do. Although they are cute and trendy, I don't think they're comfortable at all. I'm sticking with Eastland. I have always had great comfort with their clogs."
2,Not that great.,I read the other books in the series and was waiting to see how it would end. I was a bit disappointed. This last book didn't meet my expectations compared to the other 3.I guess I'm glad the series is done with.
1,Terrible Conclusion,"This is by far the worst conclusion to a series I have ever read. The characters do things at the end of the book that don't make any sense, and none of the questions asked in the first three books are answered. Don't invest any time in this series, because you'll only be disappointed."
1,Loved the first 3 novels,"This last book sucked! It was so rushed and a waste of time I dont even know why Cate tiernan started this series to rush through it and make a garbled mess of a series much like the tv series lost did in the end. It felt like this movie was rushed together so Cate could say it was done and take a vacation. Having the main bad guy show up at the very end of the book revealing everything like that was a poor choice as an author. I will never read your books ever again and make sure that nobody wastes their time with such a poor quality author that doesnt give a damn about her readers. I was such a huge fan of all Cate's books now I dont know why I wasted my time. Cate,Get a day job loser!"
4,A Good Teen Read,"Purely by coincidence, my 16 yr. old daughter and I read this book (and the previous three books in the series) at essentially the same time with the same reacion. I was already a fan of the ""Sweep"" books, and so was excited to see these ""Balefire"" stories become available. Both my daughter and I enjoyed the entire chain of books in this series and this proved to be a satisfying culmination (at least so far!) to the main mystery thread. We did think that it was a bit far-fetched that the two twins, having found each other, forged a sisterly connection, moved in together and pursued learning witchcraft wouldn't be more forthcoming about their ""hidden"" agendas, but overall, my daughter and I enjoyed the stories, and hope for more of the same from Cate Tiernan."
2,Auto Ventshade 194095 Inchannel Ventvisor,"Bought these for my 1999 GMC Suburban and the rear pieces do not fit well or work without alterations to rubber seam on vehicle. Thus, I returned these and go the front inchannel ventvisors that do work well."
1,These are terrible --- avoid at all costs *AVOID*,I made the mistake of waiting 2 months before I got around to putting these on. When I got them I figured I would go right out and get them on.... I read the instructions and said heck with that I'll do this another day.... well about 2 months later I tried putting them on and they wouldnt stay stuck. Only about 1mm of tape was touching the door and the clip the want you to use gouges your weather stripping and stops it from sealing. I actually paid more than the stick on ones for these and they are completely junk. I have the stick on ones on my wifes and thats what I will get. These things are terrible....
2,Ears,I have purchased 2 of these...one from Amazon & one from a local store. Each time one of the ears breaks off and can't be used. I have the salt ball like this and it doesn't have that problem. Must be the pepper is too hard to grind..
5,never used it,"college classes blow because they make you buy things you will never use, so at least i got this cheap of amazon. i never even read it."
3,Misses the point,"The book is fine, except for her complaints on the attention given to her disappearance. Of course the disappearance is emphasized--she was FAR AND AWAY the most important American to disappear without a trace. The disappearance of an obscure judge (Judge Crater) and Jimmy Hoffa still produce books--why shouldn't there be even more about a more famous, more worthy American like Earhart."
1,Did not work,"I don't know if I didnt read carefully the description of this product, but when I tryed to connect my 2 computers, only one could detect the internet connection. At least it was cheap lol"
5,One of the greatest political romances I've ever read,"Unravels a tale of romance and intrigue in Indonesia. Wilhem, the 50 year old hero of the novel, is a Dutch engineer and artist fascinated with Balinese culture and falls in love with and eventually marries the 20 year old Suva, a Balinese maiden. A third Javanese character, Nitar, is a fiery Communist revolutionary who becomes enamored with Suva as well and forms a third part of the love triangle that is the centerpiece of the novel with unusual action"
5,It is the Globally Optimal Solution!,"I can't say more than what already been said by other reviewers. To recap,F = {all excellent combinatorial optimization books}cost(this_book) <= cost(y) for all y in F.;)"
3,Left me sqeamish,"I suppose women will enjoy this more than men. I winced during the birth scenes, but have to admit they are well acted. The plot seems to concern the ambiguities and moral dilemmas we face and the choices we make, which don't always add up for all concerned. A serious movie, but is it entertainment? You decide."
2,VVVVEEEERRRRYYYY SSSSLLLLOOOOWWWW!,"CCCCAAAANNNN YYYYOOOOUUUU SSSSAAAAYYYY TTTTHHHHEEEE WWWWOOOORRRRDDDD SSSSLLLLOOOOWWWW?This has got to be one of the slowest moving movies of all time! I could have gotten up, driven to the store going the speed limit, driven back home going the speed limit, cooked dinner, popped open a soda, eaten dinner, washed the dishes, sat back down to watch the movie, and probably not missed a thing!Another reviewer said it all in two words, and I believe that is all that needs to be said...aside from the very well done bathroom scene, which earned the second star of the two, this movie was:1. contrived2. ambiguousRoger Ebert has it all wrong!Definitely not worth the time or the money!BOOOOOO!"
4,Stephanie Daley -,"Short reveiw on a good movie - I don't want to spoil it.Lydie Crane (Tilda Swinton)is a psychologist who interviews Stephanie Daley (Amber Tamblyn) about the incident that happened on a school skiing trip, for the court side of the case. Stephanie is accused of murdering her newborn child.-Stephanie collapses with blood at her feet while skiing.She didn't know she was pregnant.-Lydie Crane wants to keep her marriage alive and have a baby. Lydie recently had a still born.The interweaving of the lives of these two individuals as they look through their past, their present and hopes for the future is done very well. This is a very well acted, deep thought movie.4 stars"
5,Best Civil War Military Music Ever,This CD is perhaps the best I have ever heard. I have done Civil War Re-enacting for 15+ years. This music takes you back to what it must have been like 150 years ago.
5,AWESOME BOOK!!,This is THE book to have!! It is one of THE best books I have read on getting yourself together!! EVERY person should read this book and I have NO doubt the world would be a better place for it!! It is engaging and it gives you actual things you can do to make your life sooo much better!! My interactions with my family went from strained to great just with the simple changes I made to ME!! It is NO one elses fault...YOU have to change YOU!! And with this book you CAN!! Very easily while making your life with people sooooo much better!! A MUST have book! Buy it now!! You WON'T be disappointed!! Enjoy!
5,Life's little book for communicating with anyone.,"I have been putting the rules in the book to practice with my adult daughter, my husband, my mother, and my employees. It is so important to be able to validate a person's perspective but not have to agree...and not have to let the person know you disagree! Isn't that what we all want sometimes?"
5,Validation has changed my life,"Validation has changed my life. I have just finished reading ""You Don't Have To Make It All Better"", It is one of those ""I'd wished I'd know it then"", things. I have a difficult 17 year old, validation has literally given us back a relationship. I also taught the concept to my 21 year old son and his girlfriend in their struggling relationship. I saw a difference in their attitudes over night. I can't begin to share with you all the stories that validation has given to me. Thank you so much for your efforts in writing the book and bringing to light what I have found to be truth."
5,A Worthy Reference,I read this book many years ago and it helped me deal with some serious depression issues. I got the updated version and am reminded what an important reference this is for mental health. My homeschooled teenage son has it as his required life skills reading.
4,"Very practical, not just philosophy","As a father of four, ages 10 - 2 the two things I liked most about this book are; First, after talking about a principle, it gives real-life examples of what works (or doesn't work) in family situations. Second, it's giving me a chance to have my kids grow up in a validating atmosphere. I will never say ""you're not mad,"" or ""you don't really think that"" again. Someday my children are going to write a big thank-you note to the authors. :-)"
5,Exactly what I wanted!,I bought this for my husband two years ago for his birthday and he has almost worshipped it since. It fit great and is great quality. I don't dry it but have machine washed it without problems. He was so excited to wear it to our first Cubs game!
3,A fairly average bunch of stories.,The stories range from being chilling and disturbing to being a bit on the dull side. It is still worth reading as some of the stories are very good but overall I think the collection is a bit uneven.
2,obscurity,"Though I remain one of her legion of fans, with each successive published work, I find myself asking ""Why""? ""Pirahna to Scurfy"" has to be the worst offering of short stories that Rendell has written to date. The plots are thin, the endings seem forced. The title piqued my curiosity when I first saw the title on sale in my nearest bookseller. However, an obscure title cannot begin to compensate for tired colorless writing. In truth, Rendell hasn't written a truly gripping novel or short story collection since her works of the early to late 80's. I am only thankful I didn't waste a dime on purchasing this tame literary gesture but read it, borrowed from my neighborhood library."
1,What the h* does Piranha to Scurfy mean?,"This book is so boring, I barely made it half-way through; the stories are idiotic in the sense that if you don't understand it, it must be art."
4,Ex-cell-ent!!,"Tired of buying dance compilations and only liking a couple of songs when you get it home? Well, not this one! Recent club stuff with just a few ""club classics"" to spice it up. Highly recommended!! (You go, girl!)"
3,Klamp,"Not as good as it's big brother, the Bessey K-body. Does not work smooth and they come apart easily because the plastic retaining tabs fall off."
2,Dreary...,"This book should have been good. There are several separate story lines interwoven around the main one which I expected would add depth, complexity and interest. Disher has the potential to paint a vivid picture of small town Australia. But somehow - for me, at least - it just never picked up any momentum. Many of the characters were under-developed and one- dimensional and some of the situations described were just implausible to me. It was obvious from quite early in the story who the serial killer was (there was no other convincing suspect!)and there was a total lack of suspense or tension for much of the narrative. The action did pick up a litle towards the end, but that didn't compensate for the dreary plod through the rest of the book."
2,A book for the beach or holidays,"Mildly diverting, a quick read. I picked the culprit from the first page of his appearance. Lots of read herrings - but you KNOW the characters with the records are the red herrings - don't you?Some nice character development, but I am afraid the denoument lacked any surprise for me."
5,Great Family Devotions for Children,Great book for children 3 years and older. I bought this for my 2.5 year old daughter and she didn't pay too much attention. Now that she is three she really enjoys going through this after dinner each night. Great colors and great stories.
5,Holds My Son's Interest,"I find that a lot of devotional books for children do not hold my 5-year-old son's attention for very long. This book is an exception to that rule. He loves the stories about animals, pays close attention to the details, and understands how the themes relate to the Bible verses. I would highly recommend this and hope to see many more editions written in this style in the future."
4,Great for preschool age,"My children are 4 and 6 and they both really like this book. I expected it to give examples of difficult situations that kids get in at school, with their friends, etc. But it's just more for preschoolers because it doesn't have that. We all really like the book, but I think I'm going to keep looking for something that tells stories of young kids being in real life situations (that are hard to do the right thing in) so that my kids and I can discuss what the best thing to do would be in each."
4,Great for parents to read to kids!,I purchased this for my six year old and myself to read at night. We have really enjoyed learning all about God's creations! I recommend this for nightly devotions..
5,five minute devotions for Children,Short and sweet but grows with the child. I have given several copies as gifts for new parents and everyone seems to enjoy reading these with their child.
1,What happened to the Funk?,"I was very disappointed with the content of bootsy's latest cd. What happened to the Funk? Bootsy has always been pushing the envelope with the funk that's why we have purchased everything he's done since the seventies. This Cd had too much rap influence. Beggin soloists. Too much Eurodisco. There wasn't a single horn or spacebass solo! Bootsy, don't spend so much time in Europe. It's making your Funk weak. Drop those band members and rappers. Don't compromise the Funk."
4,Pretty good effort!,"This is some New School Funk, y'all! Bootsy is the funkiest bassplayer there is (even Marcus Miller admitted that!), not the best, but the FUNKIEST! His space bass could be a little more up front on this album and some of the tracks are a little too slick, but it's still a damn good record. You won't be disapointed buying this extremely danceable disc, bubba! He's still stretchin' out (with or without his Rubber Band!)"
2,Hmmm...,"Not as fun exciting as I expected from his playing on Parliament albums. Not bad, it just doesn't really grab me."
5,Bloody Bill,I bet if they had it to do over again the town of Lawrence would have taken better care of his kin folk.
4,Civil War guerrillas,"Because there is little information on William T. Anderson , I thought the authors did quite a good job of depicting Anderson's life before and during the civil war. This book without a doubt shows why Missouri was the place for some of the most brutal activity of the whole war."
3,"Murderers, Not Warriors","This was a short and 'ok' read for me. The guerillas of the Civil War used that war only as an excuse to rape, pillage and kill at will while living a comfortable life at the cost of their victims. The likes of Anderson, Quantrill, the James brothers, and others are often mentioned as 'folk heros.' They were nothing but a lower form of humanity. I wish the book had gone further into what made these men what they were.Again, it is not a bad read, just not one of my favorites."
5,GOOD SOLID WORK - ENJOYABLE AND INFORMATIVE,"Certainly one of the leading sports figures of our times and beyond a doubt one of the best golfers of all times, this autobiography of Jack Nicklaus is both interesting and informative. Nicklaus, like Palmer, Jones, Player, et al, are a passing breed. Not only are they great atheletes, but they are gentlemen in every sense of the word. Mr. Nicklaus' approach to the game and to life reflects this at every turn. This is a work that can be enjoyed by both golfers and non-golfers equally. I have probably ran into better writers that Ken Bowden, but hey, he did an adequate job and certainly got Jack's story across. Enjoyed this one a lot and very much recommend it."
4,One of the greatest tells his story,"Insights into this champion and our time in golf will be read by the future generations through the Bear's eyes. Humble yet intense, this guy never quits. Especially enjoyed his sharing of what was going on inside with his famous finish at Turnberry in 1977. He's a guy you respect for his game and his person."
4,"if you are a real golf fan, you'll like this","the one-line summary says it all . . . for me, it provided a bit too much detail on various golf tournaments . . . would have wanted to see more on business side . . . also, it virtually elminated the last 10 years of his life . . . but a great gift item for a true golfing enthusiast"
5,Excellent!,"This book is fascinating. It talks about the very taboo subject that maybe some people just don't want to have children! It's a very practical guide to understanding yourself, your values and whether or not you genuinely want children for yourself or are being pressured into it by family, friends and society.It helped me make peace with the decision not to have children."
3,"The Dark, Gritty, worst-case-scenario Side of Parenting","If you're looking for grim stark realities of parenthood, this is the book for you. This can be a very helpful exploration when groping blindly for a decision. However, readers should know that Ms. Engel magnifies and exaggerates the hardest parts of parenting while blythely brushing over it's joys and wonders. She does present some very good ideas to think about and consider as well as paints a vivid picture of what the transition to parenthood can be like.Most irritatingly, she is constantly siting ""research shows"" but hardly ever names the research she is referring to, choosing only to site two works: The Transition to Parenthood and The Motherhood Report. Two papers, in my opinion, does not a case make.Probably a good book to read when your going through the process but don't give it to your partner if he or she doesn't want kids."
2,What about overpopulation?,"Thin, vapid pop psychology that does not even mention such concerns as global overpopulation and the ensuing ecological collapse of our planet. The decision whether or not to have a child is the biggest decision most of us will ever make, and it requires the thoughtful person to consider factors other than their own small life. This book won't help you with the bigger issues. Very superficial. Check out Bill McKibben's Maybe One or the Society for Voluntary Human Extinction for more provocative, subversive food for thought."
4,Crisis-Behind a Presidential Committment,"I first saw this outstanding cinema verite Civil Rights documentary by Drew Associates in 1988, of the political and Federal government strategy to integrate negroes into the American University system in 1963 in the deep South in Alabama. Should be standard viewing for anyone concerned about human rights and progress.The DVD version unfortunately has a copyright symbol DA (for Drew Associates) permanently on the image, so I cannot recommend this DVD, as the symbol ruins the programme."
1,Awful Book That I Returned! Totally Useless Trivia,"I order and read many books and rarely return books. I rarely return books as almost all books have some valuable information, even if most of the information is redundant or useless. The ""Ripe"" book is definitely over-ripe and rotten, without any useful information. The book is full of useless information considered ""cute"" by the author. I regret that I ordered the book. It wasted my time and money. I had to spend money to mail it back to Amazon to get a refund."
5,Love This Book,"I still have the copy my mom bought for me when I was about six years old, love it. Love it even more since I noticed the cat on the window sill cleaning its self! Hilarious! Why is that important to depict? I think that it is on the second or fourth page!"
2,Smoker,"I know that this is a classic story, but Santa is smoking a pipe on every page!!! It's just not the example I want for my children."
1,hellraiser hellworld,"Listen,I am a big fan of the first two.Even Hell on Earth and Bloodline followed the basics the first two set.I know most dont think bloodline was very good,but compared to this one and the last three Hellraiser movies,it was great.I dont understand how a great horror movie series could take such a bad turn.Just my opinion."
1,My money could have went a longer ways for me,"I have seen parts of every Hellraiser movie, enough to know that Pinhead is a great horror character. I bought this for a few dollars at my local shopette, hoping for good entertainment. Let me just say that I would have been better off watching ""Killer Clowns From Outer Space"" and using the money to buy some popcorn. Really a true let down to any horror film lover. Reducing a horror icon to another sorry teen slasher film character. Don't waste your time."
1,"Pinhead goes online, the rest of us go to sleep","This eighth installment in the long running Hellraiser series, and the fourth to be released direct to video, revolves around a group of teens brought together by the creator (the always dependable Lance Henriksen) of the Hellworld online game. Before you can say ""acupuncture"", the film takes off, trying to stay faithful to it's source but in the process, completely ignores much of the logic the series relied upon when it was first conceived to film. Rick Bota is once again in the director's seat, and his direction is uninspired, the plot laughable, and by the time Pinhead (Doug Bradley) shows up, it's apparent that Hellraiser: Hellworld finds the series diminished to the point of being a teen slasher. Pinhead hasn't been scary in quite some time, and here, he's just laughable. Like Hellraiser: Deader, Hellword is beyond bad, and even Henriksen's great performance can't save the film."
3,Another strange chapter,"Hellraiser Hellworld had potential, the idea of the Cenobites orchestrating a party to capture souls sounded cool (although reeked of Hellraiser 3 and Bloodlines). Instead the cenobites are a minor role, and this time it actually hurts the overall product.The idea is that a group of friends (whom one of committed suicide playing Hellworld, a Hellraiser MMO a year prior) go to a Hellworld convention/party. The host treats them to booze, sex, and all sorts of strange oddities. However soon the friends get picked off one by one and by the time you get to the end it barley feels like a Hellraiser movie anymore.Unlike Deader, this one really feels like the Hellraiser universe was thrown in for the hell of it, and in some cases does not follow the rules (pointed out in the movie). Weakest of the DTV lot."
3,pinhead gets a website,All im gonna say is this hellraiser film is one of the better sequels its kind of a slasher film but it has some nice gore and a very good plot and storyline that keeps u guessing and guessing chatterbox made his way back to the screen that was a plus and also pinhead seems to have a lil more screen time rather then his past few sequels when he had a cameo rick bota i had doubts in u from seeing deader and hellseeker but hellworld was a much big improvement ........
2,"The weakest ""Hellraiser""","I thought ""Bloodline"" would go down as the least essential entry in the esteemed ""Hellraiser"" series. I was wrong; ""Hellworld"" isn't even up to the less than elegant standard of part 4. The problem here is not at the feet of director Rick Bota, who delivered the masterpiece ""Deader"" and the excellent ""Hellseeker"" prior to this one. It's the script, even more, it's the entire concept behind this film. It's another of the self-aware type of horror that was already proven to be useless with ""Halloween: Resurrection"". The story about internet Hellraiser games and revenge and hallucinogens, etc. etc. just doesn't work. The ""Hellraiser"" we have here is basically reduced to a teen thriller, and the only reason it's entertaining at all is because of Bota's deft hand and background in cinematography. Otherwise this would be unwatchable. Really.This appears to be the final film of the original series. Too bad it had to go out like this."
1,"Wish I could give it ""-10""!","Deader (7) wasn't all that bad compared to this piece of crap. I wish they would revive the series by actually having a good director, writer and definitely actors. It would be so cool to see a hellraiser at the theater again. Please skip this one it gives bad a new name."
3,I wish Clive Barker was still Directing these movies......,"So, Ya i saw Hellraiser Hellworld, Besides the crummy computerized gore and the dumb Teenager slasher sense, it has it's moments...It has the guy from millennium in it..And dose'nt have enuff of Pinhead in it or any new or even enuff Cenobites in it..O-well,I hope Clive made big bucks when he sold Hellraise off to others, to do his work..."
1,Deserves 0!!,"Hellworld is a disgrace to all horror movies especially the Hellraiser movies. The gore level is up as usual but other then that their is no reason to get this movie. Pinhead is in just one time and that is at the end. The whole internet puzzle box is just dumb. And how does every person in the town know about Pinhead and all the different movies, I though those things were real not fake! If you wan to get a good Hellraiser movie get H1 or H2, but this is just pure trash. The only good thing it does is it helps me go to sleep."
1,This movie should not have been made.....,"I bought this movie yesterday. And I must say that it is a disaster. To me, Deader was a decent attempt to bring the series back on track. But then three months later..BAM! We get Hellworld. HELLRAISER IS NOT A TEENAGE SLASHER SERIES!! The story is complete crap and the characters are completely forgettable. This movie is a total disgrace to Clive Barker's original vision which was Hellraiser. The series needs a writer and director who understands the Hellraiser world as it was portrayed in the first two films. The best thing to do would be to bring Clive Barker back to write and direct and bring back Christopher Young's excellent score from the orignals. But that will never happen anytime soon if ever."
1,Do they make decent hellraiser movies anymore?,"The last few hellraiser movies have been less than impressive. As is this new installment. First, you don't understand many of the goings on in the film. Most of the film doesn't make any sense and hardly anything is ever truly explained, you don't feel for the characters at all. The movie's villain Pinhead is hardly seen at all, and even he doesn't explain too much when he is on screen. I enjoyed the first 4 films in the series, but from there on, its been one bad film after another.I couldn't sit through this one again."
2,Cheesy,"This Hellraiser movie is so cheesy. Think of it as another one of The Scary Movie - Hellworld. Pinhead and gangs don't do nothing in this movie. There is absolutely no computer on-line world at all. This is so misleading. People are screaming and running inside a mansion for 2 hours. That is about it. There is no pain or pleasure. On the other hand, if you are a Scream fan or Scary Movie fan, give this movie a try. You may like it."
3,"Not a bad movie, but not a Hellraiser movie","Hellword is an average horror flick that is watchable, and definitely kept my interest. However, if you are buying this movie to round out your Hellraiser collection, be warned that this movies is NOT about the Cenobites, even though they make an appearance in this movie. This really has little to do with the original Hellraiser movies. If watch this movie expecting a Hellraiser story, then you will hate this film. But, if you can put your expectations aside, you might find it enjoyable."
3,"Where's the Hooks, Man. Where's the Hooks","A party is thrown in the honor of the puzzlebox, which seems to have a lot of followers - considering the turnout. Amongst the people here are fourf friends, some people, a Dad, and what seems like a place that wants their blood. Yeah, about that..One thing about this movie is that it is a slasher film. If you want people getting it bad ways, you are in the right building. If you are wanting to see your boy and his hooks, however, this is not the right story. The man in charge is just a bit too greedy to tell you the truth.When you watch this you can automatically feel it coming out. -Where's my autopen, pivcking up spirits: Yes, I already told them the plotline is right there. Shessh.There is a lot that could be said. A story would be nice. Actors, acting is nice. It helps the blood. Don't breathe when you are dead. Look a little more scared in the hole. And so on. I go 2.5/5"
3,Hellraiser:Hellworld,Watched it last night and it was better then I thought it would be.But they should have kept the Cenobites out and made it its own movie instead of adding it to the Hellraiser mythos.They're in it for so little time anyway and I think the movie could have stood on its own without them.
3,Ehh...,"I posted a review for Deader after viewing it for the first time and had to say I really enjoyed it. I thought it was put together pretty good. With that in mind, I went into Hellworld with the same attitude I had towards Deader.I gave it three stars due to the fact that the Cenobites (there are only Pinhead, Chatterer, and Bound included in this one) have a little more screentime and do more than just stand in one place. The ending with Chatterer and Bound literally dropped my jaw!I know a lot of people didn't like Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth because of the fact that Pinhead was a more prominent character, but in this one their screentime was necessary to keep the story alive. Aside from that, the story is ok...a little twisted which is good. The acting and script kinda made the movie a little tiring for me.Buy this if you are an avid collector of horror films, but if not, rent it first...all in all it's worth a watch i guess."
1,We'll tear your masterpiece apart.....,"The should be re-titled ""Hellraiser: Dumber"". How could you make such a mess of a film? Avoid at all costs and don't murder 90 minutes off of your life."
1,Absolutely horrible,"I am a huge fan of Hellraiser and it pained me to watch Bloodline. But after seeing Inferno (a person favorite), Hellseeker (just as good), and Deader (confusing, but decent nonetheless) I had a lot of hope for the continuation of the series. Enter Hellworld. I didnt think it was possible, but this is worse than Bloodline. The characters are so horrible you cant wait to see them die (I mean there's a token black guy for Christ's sake), and their deaths are not satisfying enough considering the awful proformances they put you through. The soundtrack was so bad that it'll make your ears bleed (at least thats what crappy hard rock music does to me). The movie is not so much scary as it is laughable. I'm almost ashamed to call myself a Hellraiser fan after this movie. I was looking forward to a sequel after Deader. The only thing scary about Hellworld would be a sequel similar to this movie."
1,Really....It is bad.,"It is sad that these new movies went the wrong way. Pinhead is only 60 seconds in the movie. All actors are really bad, specially Chelsea(Ms.Katheryn Winnick) she is so bad, the movie feels like a home made movie.PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!!"
2,The last sequel?,"As a dedicated Hellraiser fan, I was constantly ripping Dimension for sitting on the last two sequels, Deader and Hellworld. After sitting on them for a year they were released right together as if Dimension was saying get them out of here and let's be done with them.Deader was by far the best of the last 4 installments while Hellworld is by far the worst of the entire series. Rick Bota has done a classic job of destroying a horror classic. When you take a classic horror film like Hellraiser and try to turn them in to mysteries or thrillers, you destroy the foundation of the legacy. Rick Bota needs to have a personal date with Pinhead. Let the chains tear his soul apart. Thanks Rick for destroying a classic."
2,WHAT?,"BOUGHT THIS FOR A FAN, I THINK IT SUCKS AND HAS NO REDEEMING QUALITIES. GET A DISNEY FLICK INSTEAD."
5,Finally?,"Okay, so this flick isn't out yet. But this review is to say...thank Pinhead the movie will appear.Both this and Hellraiser: Deader have been complete and sitting around for the better part of two years. Not sure why the delay--even Doug 'Pinhead' Bradley didn't know the reasons behind the holdup in a recent interview.Hoping these films are faithful, at least. The last two films weren't bad at all, even for straight-to-DVD releases. I thought they kept the spirit of the Hellraiser stories while limiting the gore and the Pinhead-isms, using the Cenobites as framework for two demented tales. A shame they didn't use Kristy Cotton a little more in her return, but what can you do?Here's to hoping Hellworld is worthy..."
1,Film school Dropouts CAN find work...,"Sad doesn't even BEGIN to cover it.It has little to do with ""Hellraiser"" and what little there is to tie it comes undone 1/3 of the way through, to the predictable ending. (Plus a section After it that makes No sense whatsoever)Hellraiser? - I would rather open the box and squat on steak knives!Forget it!"
4,This Movie is much better than expected,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie. I thought it was just a little bit inferior to Hellraiser: Deader but still in the same class. I certainly would not rate it in the dregs of Hellraiser III. The shocks were very convincing, and the cenobites were creative and new. I was very impressed that they were still able to make such a good quality movie after 8 versions.By the way, for those of you who are looking for inventive, excellent quality Hellraiser box configurations at extremely reasonable prices, take a look at this link: http://www.pyramid-gallery.com/index.html#1749For now, they are offering three box configurations at amazing pre-order prices that will be ready to ship on 2/1/08.

5,"... and Finally, I have it! =)",For long years I used to have the first album and I always love it. This one is proving be as good as the other.
5,"Adventure story, #1!","This is the best book I have ever read! It is a wonderful adventure that has humor, romance, drama, tradgedy and mystery. All in all, it takes your breath away. Dumas' portrayal of these four loyal and oh so likable companions is so real that you feel that they are your personal friends by the time you are finished with this book. You are far from wasting your time if you pick up The Three Musketeers. This classic story grabs onto your heart and your memory and doesn 't let go for a long time."
5,Historical political drama at its best,"Three Musketeers by Dumas has got to be one of my favorite books ever written.I decided to read it after seeing the recent movie adaptation. For anyone who liked the movie-read the book-it's a hundred times better! The plot twists are more involved,the characters are allowed to develop properly, the humor is more subtle. Everythingabout the book is great. I can't remember when I've enjoyed reading abook more than when I read Three Musketeers. I highly recommend this bookto anyone who enjoys classic literature, historical fiction, French novels, orjust a great story about how good can win over the forces ofevil."
5,The BEST book I have EVA read!,"WOW! this book is amazing! I love reading classic novels, and this book comes tops with me! Dumas uses events in history to make this great story filled with action, adventure & romance as i've never seen it b4! (I've read enough teen romances, thanku very much!) After this, its not possible 2 go back 2 teen romances, cos this is REAL love! This was 1 of the first books to make me cry! I LOVED IT!"
3,Entertaining historical novel,"Not in the level of his previous ""Conspiracy of Paper"", this historical novel by author David Liss is nonetheless entertaining. Set amidst 17th century Amsterdam's Sephardic Jewish community, the protagonist is Miguel, a Jew who has escaped the inquisition in Portugal, and lives through his street smarts by trading commodities in the budding stock exchange (the world's first). After suffering heavy losses in the sugar trade, Miguel suddenly finds himseld enlisted by a Dutch widow enlists him in a secret scheme involving the coffee trade (then an exotic beverage in Europe). But soon Miguel founds that everything is not as clear as he thought. There are lot of twists and turns, and each character in the novel seems to have a hidden agenda. One question: why are the gentile characters always portrayed as irreedemably dumb?"
3,"tantalizing tidbits, with a plot that doesn't deserve them","There are a lot of great bits in this book. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of various characters trying coffee for the first time -- their thoughts and sensations are described without the slightest bit of 20th-century hindsight. The descriptions of Amsterdam's Jewish community and the workings of the early stock market are also fascinating. But as other reviewers have said, almost all the characters are unappealing or underdeveloped, or both, and the ""mystery"" plot is really more of a study of paranoia and infighting in a tightly-knit subculture. I was curious enough about how it all worked out to read to the end of the book, but it didn't seem worth the time I put into it."
1,Not worth your time,"This book has an interesting premise. But things take a long time to happen, none of the characters have any redeeming qualities, and the ending has a pointless even; overall a big let-down. I felt I needed to immediately start a new book to get the taste of this one out of my mouth."
2,historical book,the coffee trader is tedious to read but fascinating as to historical facts about trades on the market. I had to put the book down and return to the story some days later and still I have not finished reading the book. I do hope the ending is a happy one. adele avruch
4,great read for us coffee junkies,"liss does a masterful job of transporting the reader to a time and place that are so distant (yet not so...) from our modern world. the plot itself is fascinating, especially for those with a passing interest in wall street or commerce, but at the end of the day, this is just a wonderful suspense novel. i couldn't put it down, and more than once came to the conclusion that it would make a terrific movie (if executed well). liss clearly did his homework, and his depiction of 17th century Amsterdam (replete with its questionable characters) is a treat to read."
2,"Great historical scenes, but...","I found the plot and characters really lackluster. I'm surprised to see so many good reviews--I'm a voracious reader and rarely put a book down disatisfied, so my reviews are normally higher than average. But this book was a disappointment. I really did enjoy the historical tidbits and the descriptions of Amsterdam, but by the end felt like I didn't care about any of the characters and really wasn't that interested in what happened to them!"
2,Like a lukewarm cup of instant de-caf,"I really wanted to like this book and I appreciate all of the research that the author did into his subject and period. He really did do a wonderful job of recreating 17th Century Amsterdam and of making it seem authentic. Unfortunately, more than 100 pages into the book I still couldn't find enough of a plot to keep me interested or a charecter that I cared enough about to want to get to know any better. Since my reading time is precious to me I regretfully closed the covers of the ""Coffee Trader"" and moved on."
3,I Prefer My Coffee Black!,"This book came so highly recommended that perhaps I could only be disappointed. Yes, Liss has written a ""page-turner."" I learned some things about 17th century Amsterdam, commodity trading, and the strong prejudices of the time. Yet I found the characters little more than charicatures and I resented having to keep track of all the twists and turns of nearly 400 pages of plot. In short, I would have enjoyed my coffee more had I taken it black!"
1,a very weak cup of coffee- one to go short of,"i enjoyed D.L. first book ""the conspiracy of paper"" which had a good sensible plot and was interesting with his knowledge of the city of London's financial activities in the early eighteenth century .However ""the coffee trader "" was poorly read- you could not tell the difference between the various men within the book and with a mid Atlantic dutch accent!!! .Also the story had too little substance solely based on the ""futures market"" and Jewish community in Amsterdam for it to last for 12 hours --really boring -- my wife used it to send her to sleep in the car whilst i was driving long distances ."
2,Coffee trader could have been better,"The idea behind the story was good. A great setting, and good characters. The problems with the book were historical value was diminished by too much that was inaccurate; all of the charactes were disgusting and were tricksters, slobs and cheats, all painting the supposedly pious Jews of the period too look like dishonest greedy thieves....no one was righteous; all immoral or amoral, everyone out to cheat everyone else all for different reasons was depressing, and the long discussions about the commodity trade were confusing to someone who didnt know the business, and finally, too much vulgar language which was inserted to create a sense of salacious appeal which was uneceesary.....although the concept was good and the setting interesting, the book failed in the story line itself"
3,Dreary and depressing topic but well written,"The history was interesting but the topic and plot tended to be explicit as to the morals and conditions of the times. While it was well-written technically,and I finished the book I really didn't enjoy it."
4,17th Century Intrigue Brewed Right,"If you're somebody who prays to the gods of java every day, that fact alone would make you want to read this, Liss sets his book in 17th century Amsterdam where a shrewd Jewish trader who's desperately down on his luck, is drawn into a money making scheme that involves a new berry called the coffee bean that supposedly produces near miraculous results in those who ingest it. But there's plenty of things standing in his way. There's a dangerous and mentally unstable client who blames Miguel for his current poverty, there's his brother who is colluding with one of the most powerful men in the city who wants nothing more to see him fail, and his brothers' attractive and unhappy wife, who seems eager to trade her husbands bed for Miguels."
5,Historical fiction perfection,"Very nice, you can feel you are in the historical city of Amsterdam while reading this book - and smell the coffee too. Most of all I liked the description of the people, it all feels true, and is a quite fascinating era. I thought this was even better than Liss' previous book,A Conspiracy of Paper: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle), which is no small feat."
5,"Crackling good ""noire"" novel that transcends typical categories.","The Coffee Trader is an entertaining page turner with danger, romance, mystery and lots and lots of lying and deception on the part of virtually everyone in the narrative. The central action might focus on commodity manipulation (something that some people might find boring - but which is actually as good a theater for action as any crime drama) but the meat of the story involves sexual desire, culture clashes, alliance making and criminal scheming and betrayal straight out of noire film. There's a wicked twist at the end too. The fact that the setting is a brilliantly researched and detailed seventeenth century Amsterdam is just icing on the cake. This one was fun. Highly recommended."
3,Irritating,"I found the central character, Miguel, so irritating that many times I considered just stopping and puting the book aside. It's not that I need the protaganist a perfect person, but my parents raised me to be an honest person. Miguel is very dishonest and saw himself as being a wonderful businessman. He blamed other men as being terrible scoundrels who were only doing the same or less than he was. A little of this would be okay with me, but the farther I went into the book, the more I wanted to slap him silly. The only reason I completed the book was that I wanted to see the final solution. I really did not want to go through all the steps to get there."
3,Stuck with it to the end,"This book seemed to take me forever to read, but I stuck with it to the end, which I suppose is a good sign and the reason for the three stars. As others have said the historical nature of the story was most interesting to me and I did enjoy reading about the early days of trading on the exchange and the financial intrigue. On the other hand, the overall story just seemed to drift for page after page after page with nothing much moving the narrative along. If you are looking for fast paced historical fiction, this is not it, but for a leisurely tour of 1650's Amsterdam, I suppose you could do worse."
3,"Not as good as ""Spectacle"" and ""Conspiracy""","I don't know...maybe it's because I've just finished reading the first three books in George Martin's ""Ice and Fire"" series that this book felt a bit weak in comparison--kind of like listening to the Beatles for a few weeks and then turning on the Monkees.The chief problem seems to be that the main character has virtually no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Sure, the ""Benjamin Weaver"" character in Liss's other two (superior) books is somewhat of a likable scoundrel--this guy's just a scoundrel. And that makes a big difference. I just didn't really like this ""protagonist""--if we can call him that--and had little interest in either his success or destruction.The ending, which is stunningly anticlimactic, provides us with a few more reasons to dislike him (as if we didn't have enough). Frankly, I'm not sure what the author was thinking.An entertaining read, and a quick one, but a bit of a dissapointment after ""Conspiracy"" and ""Spectacle."""
2,Stopped reading after 30 pages,"I stopped reading this book after 30 pages. The story seemed very compelling when I bought the book, but it was a big disappointment. Contains endless details about the inquisition of the Jewish community and fails to grab my interest. A major bummer........."
5,A Very Entertaining Tale about Early Capitalism,"I read this book a few years ago but think about it often. It really takes you back 350 years and puts you in the mindset of the early days of exchanges. You get sucked right into the story about the different markets, such as West Indian tobacco, brandy, metals and ahhh yes coffee. It's comical to see the many different conditions that influenced the market then are still moving markets today. The stories, the tips and the rumors that make their way around trading floors today are almost identical to those from 350 years ago and the intentions of the fabricator are surly the same, to make a trading profit.The tale takes place in Amsterdam and as anyone who follows markets knows the Dutch are no strangers to wild speculation on anything from real estate to tulips; this time around its coffee, and o what a ride.By Kevin Kingston, Author of, A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate: A True Story about the Ups and Downs from Wall St. to Real Estate"
3,"More Caffeine, Please","Set in 17th century Amsterdam, this book concerns itself with on Miguel Lienzo, a Portugese Jewish commodities trader....In an attempt to rebuild his fortune and reputation, Miguel goes into partnership with a comely Dutch widow in a scheme to corner the market on some new-fangled thing called Coffee...and the games begin...Financial skulduggery, personal vendettas, comely lasses in doorways, and the ruling body of the Jewish community, all conspire to thwart Miguel at every turn. but he is his own worst enemyi was disappointed in this book, more for its pacing than anything...with a wealth of historical information and obviously thorough research...the ""story"" started to drag about halfway through..and , while i finished the book it was a chore..too bad, that because the ending is very good...given that no character herein was very appealing...none was repulsive...in the end Miguel may have recovered his position...but he lost much more..... not his self-confidence, however."
5,Enjoy over cups of coffee,"I read this book mostly at the beach and it is an easy reading, great book. I enjoyed the fact that the stock exchange and financial instruments are so important over the entire book's plot. They are well explained, even for those who haven't even heard of them. The atmosphere is great!I highly recommend it."
3,Rote ie very spiritless echo of earlier work,"Having very much enjoyed the story development and historical setting of ""Conspiracy"", I was much disappointed in the Coffee trader story which meandered aimlessly, had uniformly unsympathetic characters, and meandered aimlessly (I'm only half joking...). Very UNcompelling read."
5,Great introduction & overview,"This is still a great introduction to the subject. Being familiar with the majority of current financial 'engineering' texts, I can honestly say this is still a very good book. It does what it claims to do - and sticks to the intended audience."
1,Oh gosh!,"This book has got to be one of the biggest letdowns. It pretends to deliver something that the name suggests, a ""definitive guide to structured products"", and all it does is give an endless soup of payoff profiles for standard derivatives products. Its something that almost everyone who worked in this area ever knew and didn't bother putting on paper, since they never needed it and will never need it. Not to mention an amazing lack of math for such a mathematical area. This is paraded as ""common sense"", and common enough it is, with a nice price tag attached! Don't buy it, you'll just waste your well-earned cash. (...)"
5,A Masterpiece,"For my postgrad course, I have read a number of books to get an understanding of the world of Derivatives. Books from Hull and Natzenberg are a good introduction, but when it comes to the use of derivatives I find them rather poor. This book from Dr.Kat has done it, it gives a look into the kitchen of the derivative structurer. It is written in a pleasant way, without number cunching and extreme mathimatical equitations. It gives and UNDERSTANDING and that is what makes this book so unique.Well done Dr. Kat with this masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Baroque tab top review,Curtains were everything indicated in the description. They are beautiful and well worth the money. I would order from here again without hesitation.
4,Nice addition to my yoga dvd collection,"I picked this up in a cheapie bin at a local discount retailer one day on a whim and it actually took me several months before I decided to give this a try and I was pleasantly surprised. I generally alternate between Jillian Michaels Yoga Meltdown dvd and Biggest Loser Weightloss Yoga but have been looking for a little variation between the two. I will admit, this video is very cheaply made but don't let that stop you from giving this dvd a shot. You start with a 5 minute warmup and I'll admit that I skip it because to me it's not much more than deep breathing. The rest of the video is broken into 10 minute segements: upper body, lower body, balancing, pilates core and pilates legs. I really like this video. It's a nice change of pace from the repetitive warriors and downward facing dogs in most yoga videos."
4,tough pilates,"This is a good hard workout with lots of variety in poses and gives a great workout for the legs especially. Only complaints are lousy sound quality and it's hard to the point of causing injury if you're not careful. NOT for beginners!!! I get pulled a muscle the first time and get leg cramps everytime I do it. Use caution, but you'll sweat w/ carly."
1,Dont !!!!,"This DVD was made in someone's garage, it was so bad I had to turn it off, the instructor was hard to hear because of static, she had her sister and mother in the DVD, it was so bad, I wouldn't ever recommend this to anyone beginner either."
4,"Good, but I miss Fox & Co.!","A good read, but I miss the comraderie and banter that goes on between Inspectors Alleyn and Fox, as well as the fingerprint and photography experts, Bailey and Thompson. It's strange, because I didn't feel the same way about _When in Rome_, where Alleyn is traveling outside of England, and therefore is without his usual force. Anyway, it's still a good read. Once again, the theatre becomes the stage for a murder, when a carefully timed birthday gag goes wrong and ends up killing someone who doesn't seem to have an enemy in the world. Taking place in New Zealand, Marsh gives the reader a good introduction to her native country."
4,The Beginning for Darkthrone,This is Darkthrones first release and is not black metal... its more death/grunge. Overall very good album no where near as dark as their later releases but still a good CD and definetly worth buying if you enjoy Burzum they sound a bit like em. very raw and energetic very low end production quality gives this album a very gritty sound which IMO gives a band a better feel.
4,The only Dark Metal CD,"Dark Metal isn't a very popular genre cuz bands that play it usually end up going black metal. Lyrical content is stupid, but these guys can play. Goodness satan worship is becoming so trendy in the black metal/dark metal genres. Darkthrone just does it for show. Besides satan is stupid, and if he's better than God, then how come he can't take the throne?"
3,fits where I want it to,"I use it for my Sansa mp3 player in my car. I hook it into the jack in the center console, which doesn't have much space,plug in the Sansa and its good to go."
4,The Charming Sir Robert Carey!,"This is P.F. Chisholm's first mystery involving a true life character by the name of Sir Robert Carey, who really was a courtier in Queen Elizabeth's realm. I found the plot to be a bit confusing at times but I really liked the character development and at times found myself chuckling over Sir Robert's antics and clever disguises. He's also known as Robin by his sister Philadelphia(Philly.) The author also does a good job describing the historical background and environment of the Scottish border at that time and of all these uprisings and rebels. She also has obviously done a lot of research about the Elizabethan era as she almost brings one back to that period with the descriptions of dress, manners, dialect, and customs. I think this was a pretty good first effort and I look forward to reading more about the beguiling, handsome, and clever Sir Robin!"
4,Love and Mercy for Brian Wilson,"I recently saw Brian Wilson in concert in Philadelphia. His encore was not ""Surfs Up"" or ""Until I die"", which several People were requesting. It was ""Love And Mercy"" a track from this CD. The song tell us where Brian is presently at. Who is more deserving of Love and Mercy than this tormented genius. I love this album, and I love his more recent ""Imagination"" album. If you appreciate Brian Wilson you will like this album.egere@aol.com"
1,This EP never came out.,It was supposed to coincide with Brian's tour of Japan but the label couldn't get clearance. It never came out so don't waste your time trying to find it.
5,"Of ten books on the subject, I rate this #1","This book was the best book that I have read about PDD-NOS. The author is clearly a leader in the field and does a good job of writing for a general audience. The book covers everything from the physiological aspects of the disease as well as coping with the disease. A definite must read if you find your child diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.If I have a question in the future, this is the first place that I will go for answers. I wish I could be more specific, but it has been several months since I read it. However, it is the best book of about ten books that I have read on the subject and felt that a recommendation was due.Note this book is a translation of the original. In most cases, the fact that it is translation is transparent. Only once or twice did I have to reread a sentence to understand the meaning."
5,Movie star Pony,"Hi!I love this book because I know how Anna feels.Everyone loves my Pony.In this book Anna is stumped.She knows Acorn is a special pony but was being in the circus enough?Then a movie star called Bette is in town.She sees Acorn and wants to ride him in her movie.But Anna and her Pony Pals Pam and Lulu find out that Bette is snobby.And Bette wants Acorn for her birthday!Anna,her Pony Pals,Snowhite and Lightning must use all there Pony Pal Power.And Anna comes up with a plan to get Acorn back.Will it work?Find out in this great book."
5,It's great.,"I noticed there was only one review for this album, so I wanted to give my 2 cents in case anyone is thinking of buying it.I LOVE this album. I first heard them in a club in DC about 5 years ago...they were opening for someone I can't remember, but I sure remember Cibo Matto. These two cute japanese girls playing heavy metal on stage....I immediately fell for them and bought their CD, Stereotype A, the next day.I was suprised to find their CD differing from the live act I saw, but it is great sound nonetheless. They do it all and they do it well. I don't know how you clasify this music, but it has super beats and fun lyrics and the girl's accents are perfect. I highly reccomend."
2,NOT 8 cups,"The product size is completely misleading. This does not hold 8 cups -- it holds one liter/34 oz, which is less than 4 cups. The box itself says that it makes enough for ""2 mugs."" I thought I was purchasing something suitable for a family, but it is way, way too small. Please, Amazon, rewrite your description of this product."
2,Get the 'dish wand' not the 'scrub wand',"We love the wand, but we hate the 'scrub' head. We've never had that scrubby green bit on the end last more than two weeks before falling off. It can be super-glued back on, but that only postpones the inevitable.This product rates two stars instead of one only because you can use the 'dish wand refills' with it. The 'dish wand' head lacks the scrubby bit at the end, but it lasts much longer due to the one-piece construction. Our local housewares stores only carry the 'scrub wand refills' these days, so we'll be buying 'dish wand refills' on Amazon for now!"
2,We're trying to be nice...,"Don't be fooled by the awesome title. It's a rock opera, of sorts, but lacking the basic melody that most shows of its type are able to handle. The singers mostly just scream, and when they attempt to sing, sometimes in harmony!, they don't quite make it. It's a cool concept, but the lyrics are fairly predictable, and the album is, as a whole, unlistenable. We give it two stars, hey, they tried."
5,Quotations,"For those who love quotations, this is a lovely little book, a perfect gift. A very attractive layout and cover, and an excellent collection of quotes from well known (and a few not-so-well-known) people.The topic is desire, and all it encompasses."
1,buyer beware,don't buy this dvd. i have listened to and own alot of concert dvds this is buy far the worst sounding dvd you will hear. with all the technology out there this dvd sounds like this that is not right. don't buy this dvd it is a waste of money.
1,Needs work,"First things first---a quick check on the band's own website has no mention of this DVD and I think I know why---most likely, the label that issued it (Cleopatra) is not the label Great White is currently affiliated with (Shrapnel). This is probably a ""cash in"" on the fact that Great White is doing a reunion tour and has a new album coming out so I doubt this has been endorsed by the band, regardless of what the liner notes say. Much like the recent Stephen Pearcy and L.A. Guns DVDs, this one sort of misses the mark. Since no other footage is currently available, you can argue that it is nice to have for that, but the footage itself leaves a bit to be desired. It's certainly live and raw and while I don't want a hard rock band to be all polished up in the studio, this could have stood some sprucing up. It's more bootleg footage than an actual commercial release. It's not unwatchable, but it is lacking in quality somewhat, so just be forewarned that it is not some pristine high def DVD."
2,BOOTLEG,though i had read some reviews before i bought that dvd i didn't expect it to be so bad (quality).The capturing and the sound is probably of the worst bootlegs i own.The cover gives you the impression it's an official release but 101% it isn't it.The only good thing is the GREAT WHITE's performance which is excellent..........
1,5.1 surround...for what?,"Being a big Great White fan I was so fired up to have a DVD concert from these guys, but when I popped it in, what a disappointment.I can tolerate the hand-held camcorder quality video footage, but the sound? What were they thinking? Why didn't they use audio from the mixing board and dub that over the camcorder sound? That would have been perfect. It should have at least been specified on the packaging that it was an authorized bootleg type thing. Oh well, it's still cool to watch these guys rock out."
2,Nothing more than a bootleg,"I love Great White and have had the pleasure of seeing them live and they are an excellent band. Having said that, I am very disapointed with this release. The video and sound are bootleg quality. The DVD says these shows were hand selected by the band. I find that hard to believe. This was obviously shot with a camcorder by someone in the audience. The band does an excellent job and the shows are good, it's just hard to get past the quality of the sound and video. If you have never seen Great White, you might want to pick this up. I've watched it once and probably won't watch it again. Know what you are getting if you buy this."
2,Color is way darker than it appears,I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color. In fact they were so dark that they almost look black. I have washed then about 5 times but they won't fade.
3,Not for me,"Smells too strong and very jasmine on me, gives me a headache. Just goes to show that one should definitely spray on their own skin first before ordering =)"
1,Doesn't smell good,I thought I would try it because I herd it smelled fresh. It smells cheap like body lotion from The dollar store. I am not happy.
1,Sort of embarrassing,"I was fairly certain that my wife had accidentally doused herself with room deodorizer, but no, it was Glow by JLo. We had to wash everything the perfume had come in contact with as it reeked of Oust or Lysol."
2,ordered wrong glo!,I meant to order Miami Glo instead of this one. I love!!!the scent of Miami Glo. Regular Glo gets just two stars from me. Too Flowerey for my taste!
2,I DONT LIKE,IT SMELLS LIKE DEAD ROSES. TO ME ITS A PERFUME FOR OLDER PEOPLE. IN THERE LATE 50S MABEY. I RECOMMEND yU NOT TO BUY THIS PERFUME.
1,Something is wrong with the scent,"I have worn this scent since it first came out and have always loved it. When it was on a terrific sale at Amazon, I immediately order two. I had just run out and open the perfume immediately sprayed it on and was very disappointed. I don't know if it was stored improperly or is a fake, but it not Glow. There is a possibility that they have changed the scent at the manufactures for some reason. I am now on the hunt for a new fragrance. I called to return it and was given an immediate refund (Thanks Amazon)."
5,Greatest Eau De Toilette,This eau de toilette has the most wonderful clean fragrance. I love it and it's so hard to find. I'll be back for more. P. Felton
5,Light & Fresh,"This is one of my new favorite scents. It is a light, young scent. It has a sweet smell but not overpowering. ""Glow"" is suitable for daytime wear as well as evening. Since ""Glow"" has a light and clean smell, I doubt that it would offend in a small setting, such as a small office, car or other confined area - like some other new famous scents. The scent stays with me all day, subtly. I want to comment on the bottle since it is obvious that some thought went into this design and marketing. The bottle is really beautiful and a bit out of the ordinary. The neck of the bottle is adorned with silver and crystal (?) initial logo necklace. The extra thought was given to this product to make the consumer feel like they have purchased and are wearing something special. I am ready for my next bottle."
5,smells good to me!,"I just picked this up today and have been wearing it all day - so far I love it. It's a little bit musky and a little bit fruity, and it also has a sort of powdery scent to it - very light and clean and feminine, which I think will be great to wear to the office."
2,Wow to oww,"Grapefruit, orange flower, neroli, rose, amber, sandalwood, jasmine, vanilla, orris & a base of musk come together in a curvy bottle to form a soft, feminine & sensual scent which deserves 5 stars.However, half an hour after application my skin flared red, blotchy & very itchy. A real shame as the fragrance is brilliant, so good that I kept on using my 100ml bottle despite the irritation.Try before you buy!!* `Live', her third fragrance is fabulous - I suggest those with sensitive skin like myself to try it!!!"
1,Imitation,The product arrival was indeed on time but the item was an imitation. The scent would be lost after half an hour of spraying onto the skin.
1,Absolutely not the Original Scent,The product is not the original Glow by JLo. The scent is just nothing like it. I have been using this for a long time now and I am very familiar with the smell.It is just not the same.
4,Smelling floral,"Enjoyed the fragance in the spring, recently reordered and I so enjoy it in the winter because it's a reminder spring is on the way."
1,perfume lost not more than 1 hour,This review is from my sister. I gifted it to her but came to know this as a imitation. It is not even lasting for more than 1 hour. Do not waste money on this item.
3,Smells like soap,"I wore this years ago and coworkers would say it smells like luxe soap...Not the type of reaction I would expect. I don't remember getting compliments as much as when I wear other scents. If its $15, its worth buying- anything more and you're wasting your $$"
5,Mesmerising...,"Glow by JLo is one perfume that remains with me everytime - no matter what. It has that very light, sexy, and fresh fragrance. A must have!"
2,Believe I got a fake,I've been wearing glow for many years. I know the scent and the staying power that it has. I revieved my item very fast and was excited to open it. I sprayed it on my skin and within thirty minutes the smell was gone. It seems to be watered down because it isn't the normal rosey color that glow is.
2,"Great price. Smells okay, but doesn't last all day.","When I bought these two bottles of J Lo Glow I believe they were about $15 less (each) than what I pay in stores, which is GREAT! Almost like 2 for 1. The perfume smelled like Glow but for some reason the scent wasn't as strong, & did not last all day like Glow normally does for me. In addition, the whole time I used these bottles I didn't get the usual compliments to my scent that I always get from everyone (male & female - they like the Glow plus the hair stuff I use). Once I went back to store-bought J Lo Glow, the compliments returned. All is normal again. :)"
3,useful only if you know Russian very well,"This venerable book is written in Russian, using the letters also that were deleted after 1917. It's great that it's available and at a reasonable price. But learners who want to make sense of the language should use Terence Wade's ""Russian Etymological Dictionary""."
3,Just Okay,This product didn't last very long... When I received these 8 products.... the expiration was just a few months left.. I didn't know until someone pointed it out. Too bad I alrady open and used a couple..
3,"lots of fun, but not enough of it","Its a really fun game that follows the same theme of the show. The questions are harder and are fun to play with a group of people. But there are only 600 questions, and after a while they start to repeat themselves.Might be better for a rental then a buy."
2,Who wants to be a little disappointed?,"I had high hopes for the game. While others mention the lack of questions and the slowness of the game, I was more concerned about the overall feel of the game. This game seems to have been rushed out and is not as polished as it could be. While Regis' voiceovers are OK, as is the phone a friend, the game is played mostly in silence. Regis doesn't even read the questions out loud. If he did then I could forgive the game for having only 600 questions. More full motion video of Regis would have been nice also. In addition, having only 30 seconds to answer is extremely limiting. On the TV show there is no time limit, so why in the world impose one here? Just as you begin to talk yourself through the answer the time is up! It would be less stressful if I was actually in the hot seat itself!"
3,Less than a thousand regies,Alright finally this lands on the psx console the results? Good and bad first the good great show atmoshere great voice overs tough questions. Now the bad very limited amounts of questions kill the game gets boring after awhile bad 2 player modes in the end your left with a rental a real good attempt just not enough questions!
2,Freezes up way too often!!!,"This game is a lot of fun and addictive. The loading time is not all the bad for the Playstation. However, there is one major flaw that takes the enjoyment away: it's full of glitches. The game always freezes up and sometimes the graphics would just get distorted for some strange reason. Therefore, it leaves me no choice but to reboot the game. This is annoying especially when you are doing well in the game. If it weren't for the glitches, the game would get 5 stars."
2,Limited Questions = Limited Fun,"This game is fun the first few times, it is real slow to play but is ok for awhile, but after about 5 games you start to see repeat questions and that just ......."
2,For beginners,This is ok for the novice with little to no understanding of behavioral evolution. Do not expect to find any help for addressing unwanted behavior. This is only a compilation if simple explanations for common behaviors which are often considered vices.
2,A Great Deal of Effort,It is obvious that a great deal of effort went into writing this book. Unfortunately it is heavy-handed without much substance.Also the author seems to have a personal chip on his shoulder so it is not very objective.
3,Great reference for ega's,"I agree with the other review that the quality of the uniform/equipment photos is not the best...B&W, small, not as sharp as I'd like, but with the text I did find them adequate as a basic reference and I did like the many period photos. What was most valuable was the 23 page section on collar devices, the eagle, globe and anchor. Finding references for and dating ega's has always been difficult but Moran presents good photos and text on this subject. I found the book to be an adequate reference, but the section on ega's to be the best I know of, and worth the price alone to collectors. Be sure to see ""USMC: Uniforms & Equipment 1941-45"" by Alberti for a great WWII USMC reference book."
3,Nice mix of old school beats,I really bought this for the Sesame Street and Speed Racer re-mixes. The rest of it is meh.
5,I purchased these envelopes,"when I accidentally found them browsing through envelopes because I had already purchased the matching paper. Bot items are manufactured in the United States of America. Also, I like to try and make each letter I write unique in its' own way."
3,A little disappointing.,"I don't feel like this book really zeroed in on my own particular issues about overeating. Interestingly enough, it was another one of Wapnick's books that I found addressed the issue better and it wasn't even about this subject (""Children and Parents, Our Most Difficult Classroom"").Of course, all Course in Miracle concepts are just the same one repackaged in a different form: the issue of forgiveness. So, if one book doesn't help another one might. This book may be exactly what someone needs but for me it didn't quite get there. The issue of punishment and victimization seems more relevant to the topic and I wish it had been more elaborated upon in this book."
2,Hmm...,"An odd little book, as is its larger parent ""A Course in Miracles"". I personally didn't get much practical help from it and would not recommend it. It suggests that, when you feel the need to overeat, just go right ahead - it's okay as long as you invite the Holy Spirit to join you. Hmm..."
5,Awesome!,"I grew up in the 80's so this CD brings me back. Smart selection of songs and cool indie artists. I'm glad they decided to go with more rock songs rather than the really cheesy 80's synth songs. There's some amazing covers on High School Reunion. Lori McKenna's version of ""In Your Eyes"" is worth the 13 bucks alone. Matthew Sweet doing Tom Petty? It sounds awesome. John Strohm turns in an edgy cover of ""Somebody's Baby"", and The Modifiers turn ""Love My Way"" into a Husker Du influenced punk masterpiece. Not all the songs are exceptional, some hold true to the originals, but most of them are standouts and that's very impressive for a compilation with 20 songs. And before I forget there is some hilarious liner notes written by Chris Gore from FilmThreat. That guy rocks - and so does High School Reunion. Cool vinyl-looking CD too! This is definitely one of my top 10 CD's of 2006 so far."
2,Not What I Hoped,"Yes it was great to hear these songs again. The problem is some of them are hardly recognizable. The song I looked forward to most for example was ""I go crazy"" from Some Kind Of Wonderful, it was a horrible rendition. Some songs are OK, none of them are great. I would pass."
3,The Commons RULE,"The best track on this CD was the one my The Commons a local band in Trenton, NJ. For the most part, the rest of the CD was really good, but some remakes should never have been made."
2,"His agenda is clear, but it wasn't mine.","The book opens with horror stories about cows and how they are given[chemicals] to fatten them up and keep them healthly. Then it moves on the chickens and the horrible conditions they are raised in. The third story is about a vegetarian and how much better his diet is. I already knew that cows and chickens were not the best and were given [chemicals] I don't want in my body, I didn't need the graphic descriptions. Much of the information was wonderful, the explanation about protein and simple vs. complete protein was very interesting. I am an avid reader, but I found this hard to follow, and didn't retain the information. Having to trudge through the chapters made each new page harder to face. I couldn't force myself to continue to read. A book isn't a good resource when you can't recall this inforation or dread having to slog through half of the book to find the one paragraph you need."
5,Very informative,I wanted to learn more about nutrition. There is so much information on the web which can be confusing. This book is very informative and well organized. I've had it for nearly 2 years now and always refer to it.
4,Good Reference Material,"Unless you live by a clear running stream, in the mountains, it would be hard to follow all the recommendations in this book. If you want top rate knowledge of what you should be doing, it's perfect. I can't do it all, but I do what I can. And if I ever have questions on vitamins, minerals, health conditions, nutrients, I can find CLEAR, CONSISE, answers here. He is just a little over the top for the average consumer but in a good way."
2,Hard to find ingredients,I like this book and the different cuisine you can make but some of the ingredients you have to go to a specialty store to get them. I never tried any of the recipes only because of this. i hope other people have more luck than i did.
2,"Good Band, But Broke After 5 Months","I ordered this band in July. I installed it with minimal problems and have had no complaints until today, when the little part that restrains the end of the strap broke. This is the same thing that happened to the original Timex strap."
3,I guess I'm the odd man out...,"I was very excited to see when this product became available. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt as though the quality everyone talked about in the other reviews just wasn't there. Granted, it's been a while since the original airing of the series so it is possible I have just been spoiled with the current technology. I am glad to have seen them all again but will probably use Amazon's return program and get a gift card."
5,Mental Funeral,"Ok, if you're not into sludgy Death Metal, then don't get this, stick to your Death/Grind crap, anyways, this CD is killer, theres a few ""immature"" lyrics on a few songs, kind of pointless lyrics on those, but the rest of the lyrics aren't bad, Killer riffs, vocals, drumming, this is Chris Reiferts band, formally of Death (Scream Bloody Gore) only, and he is good, also check out Severed Survival."
5,i love it,persons who had neved heard any of the amedeo minghi's songs had a hugh new word to discover in musical poetry!
4,One of the better memours by an axis soldier,"I found this to be a great book, minus the gramar as noted by many reviewers. These first hand experiences do seem to always steer away from the many atrocities commited. This guy makes no bones about the cold blooded killings and desperate attempt to survive an untenable front. Really enjoyed the book as others have stated it is hard to put down. I rate this book right with ""I Deadly Combat"" and just behind ""The Forgotten Soldier"". This is a book you will probably read more than once."
4,Must for WWII Buffs,"This is a great read for all World War II buffs. Definately a new view to see it thru the eyes of a German soilder on the Eastern Front. Very objective considering, much less bias than one would expect."
4,"Not the best memoir, but certainly worth having.","I thought the book was a reasonably well done account of a machine gunner's view of the Russian front. Yes, there are better books, but this one is certainly worth the price, and each one of the veterans' perspectives is different - that's what makes these first-hand accounts so interesting to me. I recommend this one."
3,"A Disappointing, Bland Oral History","I am a big fan of WWII history. One of my favorite topics is reading oral histories. However, this was one book which did not live up to its hype.The author writes about his experiences at the Russian front, experiences which he had transcribe many years earlier. He writes about his long stints at the Russian front, the horrors of warfare, the endless cold and the unending slaughter of his comrades. We also learn that not all Germans and Russians treated each other with disdain.The major flaw of this book is that the writing style is rather bland. In other words, the author fails to generate any excitement with his writing. I find that the book probably would have been much better with either a ghost writer, or at least, if the text had been written more as a novel. The text comes across as bland, and it never seems to really ""grab"" you as a reader.If I had known this beforehand, I probably would not have read the book."
2,Not convinced,"Having just read this book, I have to say I'm not convinced of the reality of this author's claims. Supposedly 'purposely' not identifying his own unit was only the first hint that gave me the impression of a tall tale.I could be wrong (hope I am), but I'm sadly not convinced by this one."
4,Captive Soldier/Citizen not a Nazi,"In reading this book I was struck by the humanity and empathy I could really feel for a person swept up into a conflict whose ideology meant very little to him yet had a deep love of his Country, home, family and ultimately his own life. A very young idealist, hungry for adventure and glory in his role in the war, very quickly becomes only a streetwise realist fighting for his own life and those of his comrades in a daily struggle against an ever increasingly strong foe. I have read several accounts written by German Soldiers in World War two. I have little compassion for those in a position of command and leadership, but find real feeling for the enlisted Man who under terrible conditions...endured. This is such a story. May we someday learn that War...all War is a waste and as individuals ..to have the courage to stand up against where our Leaders take us."
5,Bloody good show!,"This is a powerful memoir of a German soldier at the Eastern Front in small unit close combat. The action is nonstop and the soldiers and people Koschorrek meets along the way make it a valuable read. More gripping than Black Edelweiss, more personal than In Deadly Combat, and with more substance than The Good Soldier, this book deserves its place alongside Forgotten Soldier."
4,A First Class Entertainment,"Disturbing and enlightening, if true.Given that Jones exhibits evidence of at least some admiration for the amusing hi-jinks of gangsters--I can't help wondering just how much of this material is legit. But hey--there are no good guys or bad guys here--just business. Ya' know? Just business.(Thing is--if Jack Liebowitz had tried to do to Bugsy Siegel what he did to Jerry Siegel, well, he would not have lived to be a hundred, ifyouknowwhatI'msayin'.)I suppose that I shouldn't have been too surprised that Time-Warner-AOL was founded by organized crime, considering how hard it is to cancel an AOL subscription (an offer you can't refuse!).I guess the moral of the story is that it ain't a crime if you don't get caught. Am I right or am I right? This is an amazing book--if just a wee bit too easy on the thugs. Brilliantly written. Well researched."
5,Highly Entertaining Look at Origins of Comics,"Gerard Jones, in Men of Tomorrow, has written a highly entertaining look at the world of superhero comic books, predominantly the men who started the whole ball rolling in the 1930s. This history is far more about the business (and, hence, the gangsters of the sub-title) than creative side oriented but the author makes it all quite enjoyable. His portraits of Jack Liebowitz, Harry Donenfeld, and Siegel and Shuster (the original geeks of the sub-title) are actually quite gripping and even, at times, very touching as he takes them all from kids to old men, bringing their creations, particularly and alway Superman, along with them. It is a twisted story that is presented clearly, with humour and insight. A highly recommended book."
2,Give me a break!,"Anna Deavere Smith is a well-educated, well-connected, talented, scholarly African American woman, recipient of many honors, minor movie and television roles, her own one-woman television specials and theatrical performances. The problem with this book is that she NEVER lets us forget how wonderful she is. She is SO impressed with herself that it's amazing to me that she ever got around to interviewing her, uh, subjects. (SHE seems to be the real subject.)The book is a fairly interesting look at what goes on in Washington political circles, where most of her interviews take place. If you can get past the parties in her honor and all the other self-focused hoo-ha, you might enjoy reading it. Otherwise, find something to read by an African American writer who is a little more scholarly and a little less self-enthralled."
3,The Worst Shannara Book,"This book isn't bad, but Brooks is capable of so much more. While the previos trilogy had a slight dip in quality, this one is a lot worse. This one starts off really well with loads of I Claudius style conspiracies going on, but it falls apart once the focus shifts to the hero Pen. Pen actually succeeds in being more boring than Bek from the previous trilogy, not to mention the 2nd half is a complete copy of Ilse Witch which would be my 2nd least favourite. The supporting characters are so-so and Grianne is interesting enough, but the Prince guy from the previous trilogy has completely changed character. There's also a dull tacked on love story that you really couldn't give a damn about. It gets better at the very end and has a nice climax, but it's still not enough to put this on a par with Brooks' earlier work. Hopefully the second book will be an improvement and this is not the start of a slippery slope for the Shannara series."
4,fans will like it more,"let me start off by saying that i am a huge terry brooks fan. i have thoroughly enjoyed all his work and eagerly await each newrelease. that said, i must admit i was ever so slightly disappointed in this latest release. i believe fans of the serieswill enjoy this book more than newcomers. i say this due to the feeling that this book varies little from the existing recipe that has made this series so very sucessful. if you're a long time reader you always know what you're going to get with a new shannara novel and this is no exception. the story moves quicklyand you feel yourself turning pages before you're really ready to but i found myself less attached to this particular group ofadventurers than ever before in a terry brooks novel. its a good read, especially if you're a fan of the series, but i can't help feeling that the best in this trilogy is yet to come."
1,This series is tired. Truly tired.,Brooks needs to give this series a rest. His concepts (like his prose) are tired now. It's time to move on.
5,Exciting!,"One of the best books of 2003, third in the Annual Poll of the National fantasy & Horror Club of Bulgaria... Exciting, adventurous, magical - that's why we are reading fantasy."
4,"Nothing incredibly groundbreaking, but very very entertaining.","Much like the Voyage series, this series is very entertaining and is not hard to understand. This book could be enjoyed by people of most any age. Some may knock terry brooks because he is not in depth and doesn't resort to graphic violence and sex. However, this book (along with his other works) are what books are meant to be: an incredibly enjoyable and entertaining ride."
2,Terry Brooks - please come home,"I own and have enjoyed ever other book that Terry has ever written. Unfortunately this one was a big disapointment. Even though it is probably the shortest book he has written in a while it really had very little in it. Given that I have fallen into the one-a-year trap, this one was a big disapointment. I will buy the next book when it comes out a year from now.. and just hope Terry finds himself back. PLEASE if you have never read a Terry Brooks book don't buy this one first, read any of the previos works and then if you feel a loyalty as myself and most of the other reviewers here seem to, buy this one just to be nice to Terry."
3,Let Down,"For as long as I have been reading, Terry Brooks has been one of my all time favorite authors. I have never read a Brooks novel that I didn't love. Until now. Though I have no problems with the Story Line or the Character's Personalities; I find it impossable to believe that that characters could possably be as dumb as they are written. How many times was Pen told that they couldn't use magic because they were being chased by people who could detect the magic? And yet when they are forced to use magic to defend themselves, Oh Ya! He SUDDENLY remembers! But he's a kid, so this is forgivable, but Grianne! High Druid of Shannara! Shes a complete dolt. Brooks tells you what she's thinking, the whole time I'm thinking WHAT AN IDIOT! No wonder the other Druids don't thing she cuts it!If Brooks is trying to get more readers between ages 8-12, this is GREAT! But come on guy, give something to the rest of us too."
3,Who Kidknapped the Characters??,"As much as I think Terry Brooks is one of the better Fantasy writers, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that character development is lacking in Jarka Ruus. Even though this is the first book of a trilogy, there is still more than enough room in a roughly 400 page book to do more. Other than Grianna and Pen, it is difficult to know which of the other characters are going to be around for very long, but even in a stand alone novel, all characters that are important should be developed. I wish Jarka Ruus had either fewer characters or about 100 pages more to show each character's traits instead of just telling us various chunks of information.I will read the next book and the one after in the series, but I hope Shannara doesn't get lost to another overly formulaic pattern, like too many other fantasy series."
5,"Gr8 book, just toooo short!","Terry Brooks is still my favorite storyteller; his works get better and better. I love the way he intertwines storylines, and keeps the pages turning. The beginning story of this trilogy is well-thought out, intricate in its subplots, but not in its writing. Brooks keeps the pace light, without delving into trivial matters, which some other authors, like Robert Jordan does(though he is an excellent author too). What I'd like from Terry Brooks is a Shannara novel as thick as a Robert Jordan novel, around 1000 pages! Mr. Brooks, if you're reading this, please reward your loyal fans and produce a big novel, so we don't have to bite our nails waiting for the next one! In any event, if you've read Brooks Shannara series and liked it, there's no reason why you won't enjoy his latest work. It's full of fantasy, backstabbing, intrigue, power struggles, magic, and beasts. Oh, and druids r kewl!!"
5,"Great book, from a great series",If you've read other books in this series you already know what to expect. Terry Brooks continues his Shannara series and adds another great book. Highly recommended.
4,Back to Basics,Being a long time reader of the Shannara books I would like to say that this volume was a breath of fresh air. Finally Brooks is getting back to the more fantastic and magical aspects of his work that made him so successful. For while the Jerle Shannara series was entertaining it had too much to do with computers and technology. This book returns to myth and entertaining magic. My only beef with this is the lack of real story advancement and the exclusion of one of the Eah characters. i hate that the Sword of Leah can't help with its own magic. All in all though this is a good read.
3,Inconsistant information,"C. Booker, his mother as well as the book Catch a Fire, stated that Bob Marley was the one who had been injured when a piece of metal went into his eye while welding. This book states that Bob Marley said it happened to Desmond Dekkar.. which is true? Other than the question of factual info, the photos were really nice."
4,Wrong description or Amazon sent me wrong product.,"The panel itself looks very good. But I received 40"" x 95"", either Amazon put wrong description, or Amazon shipped a wrong product to me."
1,Not good,"The mug looked great, but when washed, water migrated behind the plastic and ruined its appearance."
2,smelly!,"After washing and using this mug for only ice water, my water tasted like the product smelled."
5,We are dreaming!,"THis is a lovely romance. Traumatized by something that happened earlier in her life, Catherine St. Clair is sure she'll never be happy again. That's before Dominick D'Angelo enters her life. As their relationship progresses, Cat discovers something terrible about the man she's come to love and wonders if she'll ever be happy again. A must read!"
4,A Pleasant Surprise,I love horror movies so I watch them all the time. It is rare to find one that will actually get my pulse going. 7 Nights of Darkness did just that. I really enjoyed it and just might have to own a copy.
4,Some Great Scares for a low budget film,For people like my self who like paranormal/scary ghost movies over slasher/gore movies you need to watch this. Had some really good scary moments and decent effects for a low budget film. If you can get over a couple of the loud and annoying actors and get through the first 30 minutes it's worth a watch. Especially on Amazon Prime when it's free! Nothing original but I enjoyed it. I watched it on my laptop with my beats headphones in the total darkness btw.
4,Not a Bad Flick,"This movie was low budget, low def and limited on special effects. But, I surprisingly enjoyed it. The first few minutes I wasn't paying attention to it and was letting it play in the background. However, once they got into the house I got sucked in. I think the acting was great because that's what drew me in. These people were pretty good with their reactions to events. Not a bad flick."
1,Boo!!,"Good lord, this movie is The Most Annoying Thing You Will Ever Watch. This is so bad. More obnoxious than scary and the ""sending people into a mental hospital with cameras"" schtick is getting old. Like, at least 20 years old. Remember the show ""Fear"" on mtv way back in the day? That was WAY more scary than this pile. There's a reason nobody has seen this movie. It's awful. It's painfully mediocre, which is the worst because you can't even laugh at it. It's pathetic. HATED it!"
2,Annoying waste of time,"Okay, I came into this film thinking that it would be nice to watch and I was even expecting some corniness. What I didnt expect was the horrible acting especially by the person who plays the character Lena. All she did was yell non-stop and I was hoping she would be the first to die. I stopped watching after 30 minuets simply because she ruined the whole experience for me. WOULD have been a cool plot line and overall movie if it didnt have her character in it."
3,Not bad,"I have seen worse, but it's kind of here and then there and then here again. But a good watch."
2,2/52,"If you like fat, screaming American girls, this movie is for you. They use their vocal chords in replace of their acting skills."
2,7 Nights of Darkness,The acting wasn't the best and didn't really have a great story line and didn't explain much they just had random things occur or jump out at you. They had a good idea but didn't take it all the way. I have seen better.
3,7Nights a Darkess,It was ok to see not bad. I fall sleep on the movie and my wife too. Thank You You
1,Never Again,"I really looked forward to buying this book, thank godness I bought it used! Jodi Compton did not let you get to know the characters in her book, so that you never really cared what happened to them. She just throwed the story together without any real emotions. I do not recomend this book to anyone that loves a good mystery. There is no meat to this book. Will not read anything from this author again, do not see her improving!!!!"
3,Damaged goods,"Recently promoted Detective Sarah Pribek is also a new wife. While she's known her husband Shiloh for five years, what she doesn't know about him probably exceeds what she does. Their marriage is only two months old when he disappears, after having encouraged her to make an overnight visit to her traumatized partner, Gen.Naturally, Sara sets out to find her husband, and she hasn't many clues to follow. Bit by bit, it becomes evident that the murder of partner Gen's teenaged daughter, which happened in the recent past, is somehow connected to what happened to Shiloh.The 37th Hour gets off to a strong, promising start, but fails to fulfill that promise with a slow middle and a weak, rather rushed conclusion. Threads raising questions about relationships, morals, revenge, and forgiveness wind up muddled and unresolved, and the book's final chapter leaves the reader hanging. A sequel seems likely, but author Compton would do well to strengthen her plotting skills before publishing again."
1,Terrible,"This is perhaps one of the most boring, long winded and stiff books I have ever read. The description on the back made you think it was going to be a good thriller, but once I got started I had to force myself to finish, I bought, I'm reading it. Her writing style leaves a lot to be desired. All I can say is that this is my last book by this author."
1,Hype Unequal to Content,Regret I fell for the hype and bought this book. The premise seemed OK but 90% of the text tells us infinitely MORE than we want or need about the characters.Solution takes a minimal amount of effort. Anyone who reads this book ought to get a 37 hour lapel pin for putting up with it. The background of the plot and the search for an answer are overdone and I found the book to be infinitely boring.$8 bucks down the drain. Save your time on this one.
3,A good read. Nice start for 1st book.,"I thought this was a good book, although the ending was kind of weak. Knowing the Jodi Compton is working on a 2nd novel with the same characters could explain that some. The book read at a nice pace and I didn't lose interest or lose track of the characters like you do in some books. There were some issues in the book that I don't enjoy dealing with, but I know they are part of the world."
4,kept my attention,"After reading the reviews here, I was wondering how I would like this book. I found it at the airport and bought it. It starts right off, introducing the hero(ine) and other important characters. I was carried along through the book, happily ignoring airline delays, and was surprised to find that I had reached the end of the book so quickly. The characters were good and the story was interesting. I do agree that there is some choppiness in the writing; the flashbacks and dreams do advance the plot but they do detract a little from the flow. I would recommend this book to any traveller who enjoys a good mystery/procedural that isn't very gory and, thank goodness, has almost no messy romance."
3,Very Long & Drawn Out Plot,"This is supposed to be a crime or suspense plot. But it turns out more to be a thorough examination of a dysfunctional family. Sarah Pribek is married to Shiloh, both are detectives. Shiloh disappears one day & Sarah rightly assumes a panic attack as it is out of character for him to just disappear into thin air. She starts her own investigation into her husband's disappearance and examines his personality by interviewing his immediate family members whom she has never met & neither has her husband for a long time as he has broken contact with them.The plot keeps going through flashbacks that can be annoying at times. Towards the end, the plot is anchored firmly on Shiloh's family whose siblings are involved in a controversial ethical issue related to blood lines. The ongoing family plot makes it more of a psychological drama rather than suspense."
4,This is a very good debut!,"I'm motivated to review this book primarily to rebut some of the poorer reviews given. It is a very good debut. I will admit to mentally tapping my foot a time or two, hoping to get on with the story, but I did continue and I did want to know what would happen to these characters. The protagonist is well developed and interesting. The plot is reasonably complex with enough hints to allow you to move to the ending without denial. I enjoyed it and hope to read her sequel shortly."
4,Enjoyed it!,I enjoyed this book so much I stayed up late into the night reading it. I didn't want to put it down.I don't understand the negative reviews and found Compton to be a skilled writer. The plot grabbed me and I will be reading her next novel.
1,Rambling,"I found this book very hard to follow, she jumped from one thing to another. She never seemed to complete a thought, until much later on. For the first half of the book I was totally lost. At the end when things seemed to be coming together, all of a sudden the character had the solution, but the writer didn't share it with the readers! I still don't know what happened! I don't know what the rave reviews are for...I did not like it."
4,Compelling History Story,"This book is way too much fun. The story is so compelling, and so much fun to read, that I am left with one complaint:I have difficulty using this book as a research tool. It's fabulously entertaining, but the depth is hidden in the footnotes, and I am thusly forced to turn to other sources for the research that I wish to do by reading the book in the first place.Still, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in post-Colonialism for a lively read."
3,The Dark Tale of famous people - I had no idea,"Actually, my rating of this book speaks more to the subject matter than the author's writing ability. Being historically based, the novel is as dark as the truth. I always thought that Dr Livingston was a medical missionary and that Stanley went to find him to join his work. Turns out the truth is racist, cruel, mean, self-indulgent, and self-promoting. I did not enjoy the book for those very reasons. However, I do believe that Martin Dugard did an excellent job of research, and produced a well written account of the life and time of these men. It seems to be a true representation of their dark, cruel adventures/fate. As much as I disliked the dark truth on which the book is based, I was up late at night reading - enthralled by the story."
2,INTO AFRICA,I didn't really like this book. I found it boring and repititious. I kept going back to what it already said. I would not recommend it to anyone.
3,Good book on S&L,Good book about early British and American exploration of Africa and the search for Livingstone. Not as exciting as some of the Ambrose books like Undaunted Courage but still educational and interesting.
3,Decent Popular History,"A good story, though not extraordinarilly well written. It does serve well enough as a casual introduction to the story of Stanley and Livingstone."
5,A great lesson on bold explorers,"This review is of the audio book, and I couldn't be happier. The reader was British, and that seemed to add to the perspective that Stanley and Livingstone had. It showed how far we've come in our ability to travel since the 1800's. It would be crazy to think now that a trip to anywhere in the world, even Antartica would take years to complete. Also, how far we've come with modern medicine. Hearing the diseases from malaria to small pox that the explorers had to deal with, and that doesn't even come close to the risks of canibal attacks and starvation that they faced.In all, it was a unique story and well worth my time. I decided to look back to this book, since I enjoyed Killing Lincoln and Killing Kennedy so much. 5 stars for this audio book."
4,A good book - I presume,"Let's see, interesting story, told with style, about fascinating characters who explored a world that seems a millenium old rather than just 150 years ago - hey, get this book and enjoy an great yarn."
5,Fascinating,"I was looking for something to read that was both biographical and adventurous. When I came upon this book, I realized that all I knew about Stanley and Livingston were the words, ""Dr. Livingston, I presume?"" So, I dove in and I was not disappointed. In fact, I was delighted to learn their stories. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know more about these two men and how they came together. You will find it to be an easy read, as well as a story of tremendous endurance and determination."
5,Very readable historical suspense,"I usually find history books about periods before 1900 tedious but Dugard has done an outstanding job with this book. He goes into appropriate depth about each of the characters. There's a great map outlining Stanley and Livingstone's journey through the region. Despite knowing how the story ends I found the book suspenseful. He does not break the story unnecessarily with long quotations which keeps the book interesting. In addition to learning about the two interesting characters, you will learn a lot about Africa and the issues around that time. I got the sense that the author cared more about engaging the reader than merely showing off his knowledge. Highly recommended."
5,A Superb Non-Fiction Adventure Story,"Pieced together like a fine quilt, alternating chapters betweenthe key characters, setting forth a great chronology of events between the two explorers, Livingston and Stanley, their true life adventure jumps right out of these pages making it one of the best adventure stories written, and its all true besides. I picked this book up to read while recovering from knee surgery and hated to see it end. There is no doubt this was well researched. The writing style is superb. Buy it, you'll love it and it will become a permanent part of your library."
5,Wow!,Most of the other reviewers have already laid out the jist of the book. All I can add is WOW! At times it's hard to believe some of it but it seems to all be true. I've been reading lots of adventure books over the past few years and this is probably the best yet. If you are at all considering getting this you will not be disappointed.
4,Aliens,"C.J.Cherryh is really seriously good at depicting aliens. One or two other writers might make then more credible, but then they are impossible to sympathise with. And lots of writers can make them more sympathetic, but then they are just humans in disguise. Cherryh is almost alone in striking a perfect balance."
5,LONG LOST CLASICK!!!!!!! FIND THIS!!!!!,This BAPHOMET is from the USA! NY..to be exact!! they later changed the band name to BANISHED and of course then broke up right away!!Now ''THE DEAD SHALL INHERIT'' is one of the better DEATH METAL album's your likeley NEVER to even know EXSISTED!! this beat's out alot of stuff from around this time period!!! THIS IS VERY CHUNKY DEATH METAL!!!!! VERY SIMILAR TO AUTOPSY..but then again not anything alike!!Find this steaming mad BAS*TARD TODAY!!! THIS IS UBER ''KLVT''..ONLY FOR THE TRUE!!!!!''LEAVE THE FLESH''
3,"Nice, but somewhat one sided view","The author tells it's experience as a VP of Value America. Infortunatelly, it fails to adress all the issues that ultimately lead to the failure of that company and instead debates excessivly the virtues and defects of both the company's chairman and it's President.I believe the author is also a little too critic of it's colleagues and fails to approach both sides on most of the problems.Nevertheless, is a enjoyable story to read, and a good opportunity to see why some many dot.coms failed."
4,Good story of Internet failure,This book tells the story of Value America and how it went from Internet superstar to burnout. The company seemed to be doomed by its founder rather than by its business plan. You have to wonder how the founder was able to last as long as he did.
3,An enjoyable read,"I enjoyed reading this immensely. The story is fascinating and a real page-turner. However, after deliberating the situation, reading additional material etc., I came to realise that this is a biased view of the events and people of ValueAmerica. The success of a company like ValueAmerica involves bringing together the right people at the right time. This didn't happen at ValueAmerica. No single person can be blamed. Kuo is just as ""guilty"" as any of the other executives for the failure of ValueAmerica and his ""objective"" view is a little too objective for someone involved in running the business -- almost disassociated from it. For someone like Kuo, it was simply another company he could move on from. For Winn, it was his life. I feel sorry for all of those who invested time, energy and money in this venture. Initially, a fantastic and enjoyable read. Ultimately, disappointing and sad."
5,Mad and wonderfull times - now gone,"I found the book both highly entertaining and a bit unsettling. Was the Internet culture really like that way back in 1999? Whoa, yes it was!The book covers the dot.bomb territory well, especially the smooth talkers and marketing types. I did miss more references to the techies and the excitement on the workers' floor in this time frame.Little mention is made of the success stories that happen alongside the dot.bomb's. and how common sense and a off-key vision could have kept one out of danger of the dot.domb euphoria.A fascinating and fun read. An excellent record of the times! Missing in the book is more reference to the legacy media and old school business's envy towards the new economy, which assisted in the downfall of these young entrepreneurs. The book confirms that it was wild, it was fun and we'll miss it!"
4,I AM A NEIBHOR OF MR. DOT .BOMB,"MR. KAU WROTE A WELL WRITTEN STORY OF THE FIASCO OF VALUE AMERICAAS A RESIDENT OF CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA AND MY LAND A MERE 2 ACRES+/- NESTLES UP TO THE SO CALLED ""WINNDOM"" ESTATE (150 +)A VERY OVERDONE ENTRANCE TO A MAN WHO HAS A ""LITTLE CAESAR'S COMPLEX"".HE HAS MADE HIS MARK ON C'VILLE AND HE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT ROUTE 29 GOES NORTH OR SOUTH.THIS AUTHOR HAS SAID IT SO WELL THAT MR. WINN HAS DONE IT AGAIN AS THIS WAS HIS THIRD STRIKE AT BUSINESS THAT WENT BOMBED."
2,No suspense,"The problem with this book is that it didn't climax. The company didn't spectacularly go up in flames. Instead, Kuo lays out its problems page by page. It never builds toward anything, instead plodding to the company's demise. There wasn't a single anecdote that was worthy of retelling, which is a rarity for me among non-fiction books. I'm always recounting something fascinating or interesting or funny that happened to the main character. There just didn't seem to be any of that here."
5,What a time it was!,"If you want to know what happened during the dot.com gold rush, DOT.BOMB is a very good place to start. It is engrossing, well-written & as funny as a fit of giggles at a wake!What a ride! J. David Kuo had me squirming with tension, panting with the pressure, dreading yet eager to learn what was going to happen next. An accessible adventure about one innocent investor enticed into high flying finance & all its attending drama."
3,Fairly Entertaining,"Having worked for two dot.bomb flameouts, I can easily relate to the story he weaves - over-bloated executive structures, massive spending, political in-fighting, etc. Some of the story seems far-fetched or even ficticious, even for a dot.bomb.Still, it was fairly entertaining, but nowhere near as good as insider books like Liar's Poker or Barbarians at the Gate."
3,"Good, but drags on","This is a humorous read. It is enjoyable, but drags on, without really exploring the details of the final downfall of VA."
2,"good power, warped base plate & wobbles","Cuts a good smooth end grain, no tear-out with original blade. Base plate is not flat,and saw wobbles on the front hinge (the one for depth of cut)as well. Does ok on sheet goods, but don;t expect perpendicular cuts on 2x4 sticks.I do like the quick depth adjustment lever, and good view of where the cut is going (I'm left handed, so the motor isn't in the way - but it sure blows the sawdust all over me!!john (:>)))"
2,Disappointed.....,"I was a little wary about buying this saw, many of the reviews complain about this baseplate. This item description claims that it is aluminum, which is an error. Its flimsy plastic. And it sucks. I really like the features on the rest of the saw, although I dont completly trust the plastic levers to not snap off. But the baseplate is a deal-breaker, it flexes way too much, and is NOT square to the saw when set at zero, there about a 3 degree bevel backwards, so I have to set the saw at 3 and constantly re-check it. This also negates the bevel stops at 22.5, 45, etc. I'm really unhappy with this problem, and am requesting a return/refund.Bosch should smarten up after all these negative reviews and re-design this saw with a mag plate, like the worm-drives."
2,not strong,"at first this was a great was. the base being composit meens it wont break(i've tested that several times), and the direct connect cord is great. But recently the saw fell less than 2 feet onto a lawn and the blade guard cracked right in half, ive had dewalts that have fallen 10 feet with little more than a scratch. I would not recoment this saw"
1,Plate warps - Do not buy!,"Tossed a still-faithful old circular saw and upgraded to Bosch CS20. I'd become a faithful and trusting Bosch-brand customer. What a mistake and disappointment! Composite plate has warped; cuts are uneven; square end cuts are impossible to make; saw rocks side to side during rip cuts in plywood; I have a rock solid hand, but edge cuts look (and fit) like I have a nervous disorder; blade binds as warped plate allows tipping side to side. I'm no longer a Bosch customer."
2,An Achilles Foot,"I bought my CS20 about 5 years ago. Then it rapidly became a pain when the plastic foot plate warped, causing binding and crooked cuts. Until this week, it sat in storage waiting for me to buy another home. Remembering that I wanted to get the unit working, I called Bosch. Bosch has no apparent plans to make a more rigid plate available, and so I must consign this tool, which seemed to be a good value when bought, to the junk pile, and buy a saw that doesn't display so many 'innovative' features, the cost of whose failure is borne by the purchaser.Bosch CS20 15 Amp 7-1/4-Inch Circular Saw with Direct Connect"
3,"I like the saw, but.........","I Purchased this saw as a replacement to my 8-year old milwaukee which I loved but finally wore out. I liked the idea of the direct connect cord and the composite plate seemed sturdy. After a few uses the blade guard started sticking open (not good). Bosch apparently had a recall on some older models for the same reason but mine wasn't involved in the recall. After going past customer service to the complaint department Bosch is taking the saw back to look at it and I'll be without it for a while. This saw has never been dropped, is very clean and has very little use on it. I have never had a circular saw blade guard stick before. I think this is a huge liability for Bosch. Except for the blade guard issue the saw seems fine (I haven't dropped it yet so I can't speak about the others who have). The composite plate is a little flexy for me but it seems to cut straight and true. We'll see how the repair goes, So far I'm not very happy."
2,"Bosch CS20 7-1/4""","Purchased saw 4 months ago, depth gage...broken, angle gage...broken, 1 year refund...useless because some pencil pushing consultant at bosch said the saw was misused. The bill to fix the $100 saw is $80. I have a porter cable circular saw that is over 20 years old and has taken twice the beating the bosch will ever see yet nothing is broke on it. The bosch took a 1 foot fall off the underside of a sawhorse and the fall broke the angle gage. The depth gage adjuster broke during regular use. I do not ""misuse"" my tools but I do use them!"
2,Was a nice saw at first,"I read all the reviews then finally picked this one over the PCMag saw because if was $40 less.I loved using the saw at first. It has a great line of sight and is quiet and runs smooth. having an extra long cord is a awesome feature, but it did add $20 to the cost.but now after 6 months the base plate is warped making it a pain when cutting expensive oak plywood. It rocks from the back left to the front right over 1/8"".I put an email in to Bosch about a replacement plate but I am scared it will be the same thing and fail again after another 6 months.Should have spent a little more and got the PC."
2,Not impressed,"Lots of plastic used in the manufacturing of this saw, like the deck and all adjustment mechanisms. When I set the blade angle to make a basic square cut of 90*, the cut pieces were off by more than a few degrees. I had to use a builders square to set the blade angle after discovering this and then the cuts were more accurate."
1,Bosch Safety Recall and Inferior Synthetic Base Plate,"Never really got to use the saw because of the safety recall and the possibility of an ""amputation"" if I chose to ignore the recall. While this was a minor problem the problem with the plastic base plate would have been a lifetime pain! The base plate lacks dimensional stability in that it will not accept the rip fence insertion without a significant use of force and again more force or a rubber mallet is called for if you need to move it to your desired rip dimension. Additionally the set screw for the rip fence comes with a spring that is to long thus requiring more force during all my aborted attempts to screw it into the base plate! I further found it physically impossible to screw the set screw into the base plate without the spring in place! I own a lot of Bosch tools and have never experienced these kinds of problems with Bosch or any other brand. I returned the saw to the vendor I purchased it from citing poor tool quality as the reason."
2,"Bosch CS20 , much better out there !","I am a professional carpenter. I have had my Makita saw for 24 years and wanted a change, The Bosch CS20 looked like it had some pretty good features and the balance was not bad. After 3 months the composite foot plate has warped making for gouged cuts. I cannot cut a true 45deg bevel with it because of this flaw. The detents are not adjustable. My 45deg locks in at 43.5 deg. This is ubsat in my line of work. Bosch is going to send me another foot plate and bevel indicator but its the same material as the one I have. Bosch NEEDS to produce a replacement aluminum plate like all other quality saws have. They have missed the boat big time in this area. Based on this I would not recommend this saw for the serious tradesman."
2,forget this one,"Following the recomendations of various reviews I purchased this saw to replace a 23 year old Milwaukee that fell 30 feet off a roof bending the plate badly. In six months of owning it both the angle and depth knobs have broken off, the plate flexes badly when used for a depth cut, and today for no apparant reason the guard handle broke off,just sheared right off the guard rendering the saw useless. I own a number of other Bosch tools and can't say enough good about them. For all the obvious excellent engineering the saw has it's not a professionals tool. I fixed the bent plate and put the old Milwaukee back in service."
2,plastic junk,"I like most bosch tools that i've owned and used, but this unit needs some serious rethinking from the bosch brains. Way to much fragile plastic for a tool that is inevitably going to take some serious abuse. The table also flexes and moves way to much for consistant, acurate cutting due to the plastic scrap. Bosch needs some good old mag on this pup or some seriously fortified plastic resin. A little redesign and this would probably be a great saw, but till that happens it is a hunk of junk. Wake up u bosch nerds and tune this puppy up."
1,Popeil the truth stretcher!,"Popeil surely has a place in gadgetmania history, but to take credit for the work of others is an insult to the reader. Most TV gurus know that even the title "" but wait theres more "" is the work of the GINSU Guys. If we can't even believe the title, perhaps we shouldn't trust much after we open it. Despite Ron's attempt to take credit for just about everything except the discovery of the polio shot, I found this book amusing. But only if I were to buy it from "" Buck a book"""
3,Too big for my ears,These are beautiful earrings but tooooooooooo big for my earrings. I like Zina Sterling Silver and am having a better fit with the medium size hooped earrings. I sent these back for a refund but have not received the refund as yet.
4,Bluetech starts to find its own sound with this (2nd) record,"Way better than the previous ""prima materia""....... which strangely has a lot more comments and reviews here on amazon than this one.My personal opinion: I really got bored with prima materia, trying to hard to fit into the sound of psy-chill-psydub-psy-ambient. Too much reminiscent of the first shpongle or even shulman, with the pseudo-alien-mushroomy voices here and there... booooring.THIS ONE, on the contrary, makes a clear choice: subtility of the music, balance, in a fine dub spirit; not too many layers of sound, not trying to be too psychedellic, it really does the trick. has a nice soomth dubby rythm all the way through, and can really take you somewhere far away from where you are. NICE CD. (not my fav but really surprisingly nice)"
5,Little Einsteins is one of the best,"We have acquired all of the Little Einsteins DVDs over the past 1 1/2 years. My girls are ages 7, 5 and 3. I was never a fan of Baby Einstein videos, but these actually teach meaningful bits of information they can hang facts onto for later learning experiences. The classical music is inspiring, the geography lessons impactful and they love to dance and sing along with the characters. These are by far one of my favorite DVDs that my children all enjoy and are learning from. Why can't more programming be educational like these?"
2,By and for people who want their kids to grow up in . . .,"By and for people who want their kids to grow up in EXACTLY the same world they grew up in.There are four kids in this show, two girls and two boys.The two girls are a singer (Caucasian/white) and a dancer (possibly Asian). The African-American/black boy is a multi-instrumentalist. The Caucasian/white boy is a conductor.The 19th century Europe was the height of Human Civilization, with a few exceptions like the ancient Egypt and Hokusai from Edo-period Japan."
4,Good shows,"My daughter loves Little Einsteins. She learns so much from watching them. The only problem with their movies, is that they are repeat shows from television and then usually 1 new episode, which after I purchased this was out on TV within a month or so. Wish they would have a new actual movie like there first one, the Huge Adventure."
3,Some really funny moments,"Cho is great in her stand up routine. There are some really funny moments, and great satire on politics, society and life. Worth a watch. Just keep your mind open."
1,Could not watch more than 30 minutes. More like a DNC pep rally.,"Margaret Cho has been one of my faves for quite awhile. I was telling my wife that if she stopped doing impressions of her mom that she would be done, and it happened. Instead of being funny and poking fun at the right wing tactfully, she just comes off with vulgar language. Many times she is waiting for the audience to get what she thinks is funny. She pauses and nervously goes into her next tirade. I think gays are cool. I am not much into politics, but this was really, really bad. It is something if I can't even sit through 30 minutes of it. If I could have given a more negative score I would have. Any fans of her old material will be VERY dissapointed. Do not buy or rent this garbage. Dave Chapelle gets more laughs in 3 seconds than I did watching 30 minutes of this. It is one thing to be vulgar but funny. She was just vulgar. He career is plummeting."
1,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed much of Cho's past work, but this time around nothing was funny. Even she didn't seem to be enjoying the material on this outing. She just keeps feeding the audience the same tired routine (hate Bush love us) and the audience just goes insane.It's just not entertaining."
2,"More gay-focused, less funny than her others","I've enjoyed past live performances by Margaret Cho and was really looking forward to watching her latest. This one seemed *a lot* more focused on gay culture and 'being gay' in today's America than her previous performances and got a bit tiring after the first 30 minutes. Maybe it's just that she's peaked and is now headed down, maybe it was the audience she was performing in front of... but I was disappointed and will likely not watch another one by her."
2,i still love margaret cho but....,"a couple of years ago i bought the 3-pack dvd set with cho's first three stand up dvds and i loved each one of them. all three were funny. i wanted to buy assassin but something told me to wait. then one day at blockbuster my mom told me to pick a couple of things out and when i saw assassin, i was like, cool i'll rent it to see if it's any good. my mom wanted to turn it off after 10 minutes, bored, but i, loving miss cho as much as i do, made her sit through the first half hour. i was so sad because i love margaret and wanted to love it but just couldn't. we still have it for like another week and i plan on watching the rest of it alone to see if it gets any better, but from the first half hour, i can tell it probably wont."
2,lousy,Margaret cho is no longer funny. this isnt stand up.this is just a liberally biased speech for 1 hour. get earlier dvds and ignore this.
5,Best yet,"Although Margaret's first tour/DVD always holds a place in my heart, Assassin is by far an equivalent accomplishment. It can be a bit political to some people; so if you're a right winged conservative you might not respect her talent. There is not hesitance in her honesty, making her bluntness rise far above inappropriate. This is why we love Margaret. She gives no resistance to truth. Assassin is a guaranteed, jaw-dropping laugh. You'll most likely find yourself the next day trying to imitate her sarcastic impressions of society. There's always an excuse to quote Margaret Cho at least once in your day."
5,What the hell...,"Since when is Margaret Cho not political?!?!?! She is one person who hasn't run the to the right now that this country is getting scary conservative. Everyone says that comedy comes from pain, and with the recent assault on gays, lesbians, women, people of color, religions that don't fit into the right's idea of christianity, feminists, anti-war activists, and everyone else who bothers to use the space between their ears to think, there is a whole lotta pain going on for many of us. Margaret just puts a humorous face on it.She is amazing to see in person but this is the next best thing. My mom found much of this funny and there is a world of difference in our political value system.PS-- Making fun of the Shrub (bush) never gets old, just for the record."
3,Mildly Entertaining...,"I wouldn't say this was Margaret Cho at her best. I enjoyed ""I'm the One That I Want"" and ""Notorious C.H.O."" more. This DVD focuses a lot more on issues in the media and with the government. There was less involving herself."
1,An extremely dull & painful half-hour was wasted,"Before I finally turned it off. I had seen and liked her first thing years ago, so when my gf (a big Cho fan) picked this out I was like ""okay"".We watched for about 15 minutes, waiting to laugh or even be slightly amused. No dice. We fast-forwarded; more of the same.The whole show is apparently joke-free and consists of a shrill left-wing political screed using 'newsworthy' events from 2003-2004, interspersed with long silences and Cho making weird faces or staring dully off into space. It was sort of like being forced to watch Bill O'Reilly of Fox News fame, only if you put him in drag and made him into an anarcho-communist somehow.Very annoyingly dull, boring, and pointless. Save your time and money by staying far far away from this! (Note - other anarcho-communists may find the show minutely entertaining, but would probably have a lot more fun by just turning on the news and righteously yelling at the stupidity)."
2,Margaret's Monologue,"This performance is not as funny as her first 2 concert films, but it is an improvement on ""Revolution""*. She looks the best - she appears healthy and her outfit is flattering (look Ma - no sweat stains!). The only negative is that her routine is very topical, which may not preserve well over time. Opening act Bruce Daniels (seen as a DVD extra) is pretty funny. [*FYI, ""Revolution"" gets one, maybe one & a half stars; I deleted my review and am unable to re-post, but most reviews echo the main point: Margaret is a mess in ""Revolution""]"
2,Ehh...,"For all its controversy/political relevance/stereotype-challenging/what have you, ""Assassin"" just isn't very funny. It has its moments (""Matthew 4:17 - Shut the f*ck up"" is a winner), but her style is so overbearingly political that it more often than not just seems preachy. Throughout the sets, she alternates between her normal voice and that of a sassy black woman, the only purpose of which is to evoke nervous laughter. Even when she's doing a good joke, it takes about 5 minutes to tell, as she is either waiting for applause or spelling out her material in a condescendingly slow fashion. The funniest parts have nothing whatever to do with the larger political message, leaving one with the feeling that she'd do splendidly with less politically motivated material. We get it - she's Asian, gay, and angry. You won't come away with much more insight than that. For wittier, more playful, and equally political satire, check out Eddie Izzard."
1,Don't know in what world this is plus size,"I'm a size 16, and this didn't fit at all on the legs. The makers of this think that plus size people only have larger stomachs and nothing else, I could have fit 2 pillows in the tummy area with me but the legs are normal sized. I personally needed an extra 2"" on the thighs. If you have the same pear shape I have DO NOT buy this product!"
2,Not really plus size,"I'm a size 14/16 and the stocking didn't fit. The material is good looking, but not soft at all."
5,Very educational!,"I bought ""School Days"", ""Friends"", and ""A New Beginning"" for my three year old daughter. These videos have helped my daughter be much more social. The improvement in her just blows me away! It's great for children with, or without autism.A little expensive, but worth every penny."
5,An excellent examination of a life.,"Buckley has done a wonderful job with her first book and I am hoping that others will follow. This is a well-researched and well-documented biography of Christina. The queen is placed within her time period and Buckley wisely refrains from enforcing a modern view on the queen's lifestyle and decisions. Instead the author leaves the reader to make up their own mind.And excellently written work, Buckley gives those of us with little knowledge of seventeenth century Sweden a context from which to view Christina's life. And the discussion of Karl Gustav, Christina's father, the man who made Sweden a powerful military nation, is an important part of understanding Christina's idea of herself.For a pleasurable and enlightening look at one of the many high born (I would hesitate to call Christina powerful, except in her own mind) women floating around seventeenth century Europe, this is as great place as any to start."
3,Disappointingly Skewed,"While Buckley has admirably and extensively researched and detailed her portrait of Europe in the 1600's, her characterizations of Christina of Sweden are irritatingly judgemental and peevish. If you are looking for a curmudgeonly psuedoanalysis of the extraordinary Queen, you will be happy. If you are looking for an impartial biography or an exciting story, you won't find it here. Buckley cobbles the flow of her own narrative by nitpicking Christina's motivations at every turn. YAWN!"
3,I love a good eccentric!,"Unfortunately, there was a lot of Swedish history to slog through at first. When I finally got to Christina's misadventures, things picked up. But this was not a really compelling biography--I kept counting how many pages I had left til the end. If you want a biography you can't put down, go read ""A Million Little Pieces"" by James Frey."
3,"Slow going, but glad I stayed with it.","I grew to like McKillip because of the Riddlemaster of Hed series. This didn't have the same immediate attraction. Part of that was due to the slow going, as the author set the psychological scene of the main female characters coming to an awareness of their identities, limits, and desires. Part of it was also due to the fact that I became aware that these characters had already been developed in a previous novel. I didn't know that, and I suspect my enjoyment would have been enhanced had I read ""The Sorceress and the Cygnet"" before reading this one. Toward the end, I again got caught up in McKillip's beautiful images, especially in the desert as the story climaxes. She can weave them well."
4,great game but...,"the action is to slow just before a tackle and kicking field goals is kinda hard, but the game is still good to play.includes such players as Drew Brees, Michael Vick, L. Tomlinson, Drew Henson, David Terrell, and the A-Train. but it's only their #'s."
3,Graphics really suck.,This game is pretty good. The gameplay is decent and it has a lot of teams to choose from.But the graphics absolutely suck. Their choppy and very unrealistic. If graphics means a lot to u pass this game up and go for NFL2K1 or Madden for the PS2. If u dont have any of those systems i guess ur out of luck for good-looking football game. Hopefully someone will come out with another college football series.
2,good delivery but poor quailty,wiring routed poorly inside lamp from bulb socket to box and shorted out as soon as i flipped the breaker. I took it apart and insulated the wiring so it would not short on the housing.
5,Replacement for Sodium Lamp,"I was pleased to find this rather straight forward substitute for my old Sodium Lamp Fixture which was bulky and troublesome with bulb replacement. The night sensor also was problematic since it pointed directly to the underside of the roof overhang. This fixture was a rather simple installation readily supporting efficient florescent lamps. I also added a night sensor, purchased from Amazon also, which allowed me to direct the sensor in a more optimum direction (rotation) to pick up the morning sunrise. Overall, very pleased and wish this solution were around years ago."
5,Industrial Light,"The designers Edge L-1706 Industrial Light, weather tight fixture was just what we were looking for. We needed lighting in a spring house that we had just renovated and this light fit the bill. Very heavy, durable and look like the more expensive ones at the local building supply store. Since it will be damp in the spring house, the weather tightness was a must. We love them (we bought 2). They were easy to install, we couldn't be happier with them."
5,great lights,"They where just what i was wanting.they were easy to install.I""m doing a room to look like a barn and they are great."
1,wrong ones sent,the carpet is nice and they really don't fit correct.They came with out the holes to fit correct to the car.so will have to find some hole bracketts to fit correct.It took a while to get them and then wrong when we did.Should have just gone to volvo dealer to get them.Color is correct.I think someone just grabbed off shelf and mailed them.
2,Only get it if really needed for school - expensive - average,"Nothing in it you can't get from lecture notes and wiki-pedia, even some of the graphics are the same. Spends the first chapter trying to make the case that the subject matter deserves science status, no doubt so the phd's are sci degrees instead. It's over priced and would only sell because you had to have it for a class. It's also an odd shape, large and square despite the text being narrow and long with alot of blank areas???, makes it hard to hold unless flat on the table. Typical college book rip-off, your prof could do at least as good a job just by issuing lecture outlines."
4,exploring psychology,"i am currently in psychology for the third time,(due to it had been too long between college classess) i think the book is informative and not too hard to read (if you have too!)"
1,Item wasn't received!,"Seller did not respond despite mutiple attempts, product wasn't received. I am now attempting to get a refund, however it has proven to be most difficult. I have an open claim, still without any answers. This product was originally ordered a month ago and I am still struggeling to finish the sale. I will neve order through this seller or Amazon again!"
2,The book's condition was old.,"Regrettably, I found the book's condition was too old, which I paid $37 including delivery charge.In school, I also found a used book, looking like a new book, was sold at $40."
4,"One of the best Psychology texts, I've ever seen!","This is one of the best Psychology texts that I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of them. I used the third edition of this book when I took General Psychology and the fourth edition now that I am tutoring Psych in the college Learning Center. It is easy to find the info that you need in this book, because the layout is well suited for the SQ3R method (in fact thre is a section on SQ3R in the beginning of the book). The only negative thing is that the deffenitions are sometimes more or a hinderance than a help. It would be greatly improved if the definitions would relate to simaler concepts in the text. Also, the fourth edition is a little wordy for my taste."
5,Great book for AP Psychology,"My AP Psychology class uses Exploring Psychology 4th edition. This book is what the College Board recommends for their AP test. I also took Intro to Psych last year and found the book to be decent, but this one is undoubtedly so much better. Firstly, it's informative. The author doesn't waste a lot of words - every sentence means something (which also means the text can flood you with so much information). Secondly, Exploring Psychology is articulate and coherent; many concepts in psych can be befuddling but Myers does a great job of helping the reader understand. Thirdly, it's interesting. I had senioritis all this year but Psych was the only class that I actually stuck with and it was partly due to this book. Myers includes numerous tidbits and facts that held my attention...As of right now, I honestly cannot think of a significant downfall of this text. My teacher loves it (and she jealously guards the 6th edition with her life), and so does my class..."
4,A Good Start For New Listeners,This album was my first Mcrae album and is still one of my favorites. She sounds wonderful and plays with the soul jazz phase of the early 60's. There is a trio but there are all sorts of flutes and percussion that she adds. Carmen has a good time performing this set you can hear the fun the she is having and the audience.
4,Excellent demonstration of the versatility of her talent,The 21 tracks take you on a journey of the many styles that Carmen McRae masters. Unique tracks include Feeling Good and Miss brown to you. The difference between each track ensures that the full album is interesting listening.
2,Service is questionable,"Don't get me wrong, the product was great. One thing that needs work is the service. I recieved a package (March2006) that was damaged and I still have not gotten it replaced."
5,Terrific!,This soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Luis Bacalov's tango style brightens my day whenever I listen to this CD. It's filled with exciting themes the whole way through.
1,Missing song,I hoped to find Love Potion N 9 in this soundtrack. If it was included in the movie I think it belonged in the disc.
2,Mini mouse,Almost feel like made for children's hands. I have reg sized women's hands and would get cramps after using these. Have another 2 button Logitech mouse ( w/out the cute zebra stripes) and love it so I thought I was safe in ordering these. Cannot keep. description should say they are minis. Roller is also very gravelly feeling & does not move smoothly. Returning the 2 I bought with a sad heart bc the zebra design is so darn cute. RATS!Back to my old boring mouse...
5,Their Most Raw,"This has to be one of MDB's most raw and primitive albums. Released in 1992, As the Flower Withers combines brutal gutter vocals by Aaron and mixes it with carefully orchestrated classical/doom themes.The touch of violins made this album untouchable and remains, to date, as my favourite MDB album. They gently introduce the listener with a light classical piece in ""Silence Dance"" and slowly progress through each track with powerful and ripping vocals and music. If you're a fan of lighter albums, such as ""The Angel and the Dark River"" or ""34.788% Complete"" then you might not enjoy this album. Personally, I feel that every MDB fan should try this album!"
3,hmmm....,"i love a fair share of doomy slow heavy music, but i've yet to fall deeply for MDB. i like this album ok...and i used to have the Trinity album which was also pretty good. but they are an aquired taste. the production hinders the potential of these songs, i think. but overall, not bad. the vocals are kind of weird for me and they are waaay up in the mix, which is a bit hard for me to dig; but there are some cool moments and the violin is a nice touch."
2,New Age Plant book with poor illustration value.,"This book has SOME good info on some plant species, but it would be nice to know what they look like ""in the wilderness."" Half the book is just ""filler"". Tom Brown romanticizes plants, and ""oneness"" with nature. This book has been my biggest dissapointment."
4,To be used with a field guide,This is a very useful book to be used with an actual field guide with pictures. I don't regret buying it as he goes into great detail and helps you remember the plants and their uses much better than a field guide alone. A good book for all foragers.
5,This is a Great book!,I feel this is one of the best books on the subject of edible wild plants. It is very informative and gives a lot more information than other plant books. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in the wilderness.
1,Not worth the money,There are better books on edible plants. This book has a few sketches but no pictures. I would not want to depend on this book when trying to identify which plants are edible.
1,Absolutley The worst book yet!,I seriously want my money back! What kind of field guide has no photos and all hand drawn pictures my 4 year old could of drawn better. You buy these books to learn. How are you suppose to learn what the plants are if you can't identify them. I guess this book secures his survival because everyone else will perish because of eating the wrong wild plants.
5,Tom Brown's is different,"This one, in particular, is kind of like reading the earliest Tom Robbins novels (Another Roadside attraction, etc.). Beyond nostalgia, this is a wonderful book - a little too large and poorly illustrated to carry CARELESSLY into the woods - yet very useful and unique. Tom gives us a pre-New Age understanding of his plant friends - the ones we might most need or want to know - while spinning sentimental and spiritual threads that may help bind us to our use of this new knowledge. Collect the Peterson's and indepth holistic herbals, but don't pass up on Tom's."
1,Wild Edible and Medicinal Plants,"I was very disappointed by this book. It is a field guide, yet contains no pictures for identification. If you don't already know what plant you have, this book is no use. If you already know, you probably don't need this book."
5,"One of the Best on ""KNOWING"" plants","This is an excelent book just like all of Tom's books. It takes you past the usual explainations and gives you a chance to really ""Know"" the plants. It's not meant to take the place of other identification guides, it goes much more in depth, every plant has a fantastic story on it's use and Tom's personal experience with it. I have read most of Tom's books and plan to read them all, this one is no exception it's great."
3,Good WWII Science Fiction from Stan Lee,"Good alien. Nice character development. Nice to read something different in this genre which has been used so many times to tell similar stories--yep, all the cliches are in place. Lots of spies and double-crosses."
5,The Marvel Master has still got it!,"I started reading this thinking that it would some how link to the Marvel Universe. It did not, it in fact does not need to.The Alien Factor stands on it's own feet!Don't look for a comic book style of writing either, nope this is a book True Believers! Stan ""The Man"" Lee has done it again! Order it! Read it! Enjoy it!"
3,Lots missing,"It's too bad the author didn't wait a few more years to write this, because he missed all kinds of drama that Fleury encountered after its publication, including his suspension from the NHL for drug problems, another divorce and brawls playing hockey in Ireland.The author could have dug a little harder, too, into Fleury's messed up family and the speculation widely throughout the NHL that he might have been victimized in several ways by authority figures in his junior career."
3,Fury: Fleury and the Calgary Flames,"Parts of this biography focus on Theo's childhood development and his opening years with the Calgary Flames. I say 'parts' because it also spends a great deal of time discussing how various parts of the Flames organzation runs, with chapters devoted to the people behind the scenes. While the book doesn't concentrate completely on Fleury, I still felt it was informative in bringing me the whole picture regarding the things that affect his daily life (travel, practices, autograph hounds, injuries, and such). In a few years, I'd like to see this author revisit Fleury and write about his days with the Avalanche, the Rangers, and the 2002 Winter Olympics."
4,excellent choice,thank you so much for the order.. having computer issues. The book came before the due date.. well packaged and in great shape. totally recommend them to the fullest ..thanks again!!
3,So So,The parts pertaining to Fleury were interesting and held my attention but the book was filled with lots of unnecessary information such as the background on the team mascot and a woman who runs the concessions at the Saddledome. I was not interested in such things but the book seemed to be filled with them which made some chapters a slow read.
2,Disappointed,"The Theo-specific info in this book would make a very nice in-depth magazine article. The book is poorly written, very disjointed. The author introduces a Theo story, and in the next paragraph is telling the history of the food services manager. In one place, I counted 6 pages that included only 1 paragraph of 2 lines about Theo. Theo has an incredible spirit. His story is one of triumph over truly overwhelming odds. He deserved a better effort for what is titled as HIS biography. If you want to know about the GM, coaches (at all levels), security guards, bus drivers, entertainment managers, food service, mascots and ticket sales this is the book for you. If you want to really get to know an NHL player, read Brett Hull: His Own Story."
4,Very entertaining,"City of Violence is an entertaining kung fu flick. The action is good, and story is pretty entertaining. The best way to describe it is an Asian version of Kill Bill. I know Kill Bill was itself a blender of old kung fu classics and style, but this movie took those themes and created a click using them. The story is the basic group of child hood friends who get together to find the killer of one of their previous friends. What transpires is a progressive story as well as a series of flashbacks in order to establish the characters and story. I liked the story, as well as the action. It seemed the movie was very interested in style, but unlike most modern movies, didn't forget about the story. Overall, I'd recommend the movie to anyone looking for a fun action movie with a pretty good story, and one where you don't have to skip ahead to the next action sequence. Give it a try."
2,Extremely violent + Outrageously illogical = Not worth buying.,"This Korean movie contails lots of bloody scenes where people were hacked to death with machetes. It's also outrageously illogical. For example, in the last scene, 2 guys fought off approximately more than 30 people with bare hands and machetes.It might be worth renting if you like action films."
4,Keeps my puppy cosy,This product worked wonderfully with my new puppy. It heats up and I place it under his bedding and it is still nice and warm 10 hours later in the morning. If anything it is a little hard and makes his bed a little lumpy - but it doesnt't bother him. I take it out in the morning because he would love to chew on it and that would not be good. Don't buy a cover because it comes with one in the packaging.
3,"Decent product, not sure I would buy again though",I bought this product to help keep a small pet warm (as a supplement to another heat source). The product does get warm in the microwave but it doesn't seem to be as warm as I'd thought it'd be. Putting the cover on it also seems to prevent heat from escaping (meaning most of the heat stays inside and it doesn't seem as warm on the outside of the cover). It may be a problem with my microwave. I was afraid of heating it up too much because there's a warning that doing so could ruin the product.It's a good enough product. Just not exactly what I was looking for.
1,Heat doesnt last!,"i was so excited to buy this product and i had heard so many people that had good things to say about it, but i was very disappointed. The pad was not comfortable for my dog to lay on, but most importantly, the heat didn't last! After about 2 hours, it would be cold again. I would not recommend this product...you are much better getting one of those foil warming inserts for pet beds."
1,Hard and small...not appropriate for larger pets,"This product is completely useless for larger animals. It is very thick and hard. I saw it advertised as being placed under bedding with a large dog...but there is no way that anyone could tolerate laying on this thing. It is hard as a rock and small so it is like sleeping with a rock under you. I wish I would have know this before purchasing. It also claims to stay warm for up to 12 hours...but that is misleading. I originally bought this product to use with a medium sized dog that has arthritis as I also saw it advertised for this, and I can't imagine her sleeping on this. The only way that it might work is if I used several layers of bedding which would affect the amount of heat that actually gets through and even then I think it would be uncomfortable.I read one review that claimed they bought this for a pet and ended up using for themself. Find that hard to believe."
3,Heat doesn't last that long.,"They claim that this heating pad (Hard Plastic shell) once microwaved for two and a half minutes will keep heat for 10 hours. We use it outside for a feral cat, the heat doesn't last more that about 4 hours before needing reheating. Still it helps keep her warm for a while."
4,Great heat pad,"This is a great heat pad. Even though it's covered with a fleece, I put it under a blanket for my puppy to lay on. He's out like a light within seconds. He loves this thing, especially on cold mornings, better then wearing a sweater. lol"
5,Answered prayer!,"Great for keeping my stray cat nice and warm in his ""dog"" house. I was worried about how to provide a nice warm place for him and happened upon this, it was an answered prayer."
5,snuggle safe,This is an awesome product. We just adopted a hairless cat from lilnudist.com and they told us about this product. I ordered it and we LOVE it. Our gorgeous little bambino boy loves it!!! This was the perfect gift for a naked cat....I highly recommend this for ferrets cats hedgehogs..and other small animals..
4,Snuggle-safe disc,"This product is just what it says it is. It's a Fribee-like disc in a fleece container that you microwave. It doesn't say as warm as long as advertised, but it does stay warm for a number of hours. My animals don't sleep on it as it is hard, but they will sleep near it, which works because the heat radiates if you are close to it. I've used it myself to warm my feet at night."
4,great for hedgehogs,"this is a great product for keeping you hedgehog warm and toasty. it's easy to heat, and with the cover that it comes with on it feels like just the right temperature. I'm not completely sure it stays warm quite as long as the manufacturer claims it will, but it does stay warm for several hours. The only real problem, if you want to call it one, is that if you use wood shavings as a bedding material the cover is like a magnet for them.It is just a pain to get them off the cover so it can be washed. The pad itself is simple to clean and keep clean. This product sure beats heating pads and other electric devices to help keep your little buddy warm and toasty. My hedgehog, Sonic would give it 2 thumbs up, if he had thumbs!"
5,Best invention ever!,"We had one of these and loved it so much for our outdoor cat, we got another. We put it into her winter ""cubby"" just before bed, and it's still got warmth left in the morning when she comes out. This is the dead of winter too. When the temps got really low, we put a second one in for peace of mind. It's the best little thing! I wish we had known about it before."
4,Great product,"Super easy to use and stays warm for quite a while. The only negative is that the disk is really hard. I wanted to use it for my outdoor cats bed, but it was so hard I had to go to the fabric store and get a piece of foam to put over the disk so the bed was actually comfortable. Also worth noting PSI took forever to ship."
3,It's too hard...,"I heard about this product from the vet tech so I was really excited to get something that pops in the microwave and stays warm for hours on end for the critters!However, it is so hard that my cat refuses to sit on it and I didn't want to put it under a blanket as I didn't think it'd be warm enough for her, so now it sits unused in the corner...I will give it another try putting it under a blanket and if my cat still won't use it, I will have to donate it..."
5,SnuggleSafe Heatpad,"Hardness of the 'frisbee' product (an earlier reviewer's objection)was not an issue. Encircled by a towel (to make it level) over which I placed a small/walled kitty bed, it made a purr-fectly warm sleeping place for an outdoor 'orphan' even when the temperature fell to 15 degrees F. recently. I microwave it at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily, which seems to be adequate. I've recommended the product to several friends and will certainly, when needed, buy another for myself ! I'm trying to retain website information for future use !! Thank you ...Kathryn"
3,Does what it says...,"This is a decent product that does what it claims. We place them under a padded bed for our cat, and they hold heat well through the night. I say ""they"" because it takes two to make a decent platform for a kitty to sleep on. The disc is rather small so we got two. With only one, and that being round, you have to be creative to make a bed that isn't lumpy. So, high marks for even heating that lasts for several hours if tucked under a blanket or pet bed, and it comes with a cover that prevents contact with the surface that may be too warm. Deductions for small size, round shape and price. Kitty likes it, so I guess it's a positive, overall."
5,Perfect to keep an ill Sugar Glider warm!,"I wasn't expecting to get this so fast! It came in a couple of days and just in time:) When a Sugar Glider is ill, they don't hold their body temperature well, this is PERFECT! Thank you!"
5,My senior cat is thrilled!,My almost 17 year old cat loves this. I warm it up for him every morning before I leave for work and it's lukewarm when I return in the evening. Very good for his aching bones.
5,Pup Approved,"Our little Yorkie recently learned the pleasure of a heated blanket. Soon she became reluctant to sleep in her cozy crate....until we found Snuggle Safe. After heating it in the microwave for 5 minutes and carefully sliding it into the protective snuggle cover (included), the pad is placed on in her crate until bedtime. When it's time for her to get inside, I push it to the back under a layer of her fleece blanket; this way, she can lay on the warm spot and still benefit from the heat while she slumbers. Her crate is large enough that she can move around if she gets too hot. Much to our amazement, the Snuggle Safe Heating Pad is still slightly warm 24 hours later. I was surprised that the pad is actually pretty hard and stiff -- it's in know way a cushy pillow-like pad. The cover makes the surface soft to the touch and once it's buried under some blankets, it still fits the snuggle bill. We're very pleased with this product and highly recommend."
3,Less than 12 hours,"I purchased the product for a feral cat. Currently the temperatures have been below 32F. The pads are hard as a rock even after heating. I inserted them into a pillow type cushion which is sealed with velcro, then inside the shelter and I can say that the heating pads do not last 12 hours. The most under 32F have been 5 hours, but it definitely provides some heat and it's better than nothing. If you have an electrical outlet, I recommend the K&H heating pads. I use them for my inside dogs and if I had an outlet outside would definitely use it for the cat."
5,Bought for my dog. Use it for myself.,"This handy little disc is so much less mess than a hot water bottle, holds heat longer, and never seems to wear out. I bought one for my aging dog but ended up using it to warm up my own bed before I climb in. I'm getting two more now for gifts."
4,Great for cool days,"I bought this so my older cat could enjoy being out on our enclosed but not heated porch on cooler days. After heated it will maintain it's heat for a few hours, but I've never seen it keep it's heat for anything near 12 hours. It loses it gradually, though. I always put it under a thin pet pillow or towels. It is HARD. My guess is that the pets would like the feel of it much better if it were flexible, but maybe they'd also be able to bite into it and access some sort of internal gel if it were soft, so maybe it's a safety issue that it's rigid.It appears to come with a thin cover now. When I bought it it was just the plastic disk itself."
2,VERY hard plastic,"I was hoping this would be the perfect solution for an aging cat of mine with bad knee joints. He tore a ligament recently and has been hobbling around, so I was hoping the heat would soothe the pain. I ordered this item hoping it would be the solution. While it does retain heat for a long time, it is very hard, and also rather thick, so my cat wasn't comfortable laying on it, no matter how much padding I tried to soften it with. He's also a LARGE cat and this item is smaller than a frisbee, so the size was an issue for its usefulness, as well. I would only suggest use for outdoor applications and small cats who will be much more comfortable and much more in need of heat (outdoors)."
2,Cats aren't a fan,"The product holds it heaat for a very long time, which is good, but it's extremely hard -- so hard, in fact, that the cats don't like sitting on it. We've had to put enough cushioning on top of it that most of it's heat is lost before the cats can benefit."
1,Didn't work for us,"I bought this and, not knowing the wattage of our microwave, slowly ramped up the heating time once a day to try out this disk, see how warm it got, and how long it stayed warm.After a few trials, the disk definitely got as warm (123 degrees) as advertised, but it absolutely did not stay warm for the 12 hours it promised. It has also gotten kind of warp-y, after just 3 uses :("
5,I love snugglesafe!!,I got my snugglesafe for my sick kitty & he loves it! Great product! I am so glad I bought snugglesafe.
4,"Great, but a little small","This works great for what it is intended. We heat it up twice a day for our two little dogs, and they hit the bed as soon as they see it go under the blanket on their bed. I wish it was a little bigger, but it still does a good job the way it is."
4,SnuggleSafe Microwave Heat Pad,I purchased this item for a 14-year old Chihuaha. I absolutley love this. It maintains it's warmth for about 10 hours and you don't have to worry about any electrical cords or anything shorting out.Great product!
2,Not Quite Up to Snuff...,"Hi, i got one of these snuggle safe things to use in a shelter for feral cats. I don't think it lives up to what it says. While it is nice and hot after you heat it up ... it seems to lose 90% of the heat within a couple hours and not 12 like they claim. Still it is much better than nothing at all and if you heat it up couple times a day will provide some warmth. I'd get a couple if buying and switch off every few hours when really cold (since you cant reheat till completely cold)."
2,Not so hot,"I needed this product to help some stray cats outside, it's getting pretty cold at night (24 degrees and it's not even winter yet) this product said up to 12 hours of heat. I knew it wouldn't keep for 12 hours outside, but I thougt maybe half the time at least. Not even close, it lasts about 1 hour and I even have it inside one of the ""keep your food hot bags"" . I'm kind of disappointed - I guess up to 12 hours must mean if it's in an environment of 85 degrees."
2,Very hard and pretty darn hot,"This is a very good idea but it is too hard to be comfortable and is ignored. When placed inside the bed, even against the side and not on the bottom, the cat sleeps elsewhere.I had great hopes for this. It might work fine for other pets so your mileage may vary."
4,good item too expensive,"I purchased this item for my 2 Italian Greyhounds. I wanted to buy 2 but it was too expensive. I made some big bean bags and warm them up in the microwave. Not as long lasting as SnuggleSafe Pet Heating Pad, but way cheaper."
4,"Warm, happy kitty!",What a great invention! My one cat who's on the cold-bodied side absolutely loves and uses the product everyday. I heat 2 discs every morning and they hold heat for over 12 hours depending on where I put them. Would be great if the discs were soft. Am every pleased I found the product and I'm happy my cat is comfortable and enjoys the warmth.
4,Works ok,"I bought this for my 17-year-old cat who sleeps in the garage at night to keep her warm during winter. She screams bloody murder in the early hours of the morning to come inside, so I thought that if I kept her warm at night, it might prevent some of the loud meowing. Warming it up is very easy. Just follow the directions on the actual disc or the paper that comes with it. The disc isn't too warm (I wish it could be a little warmer), and it feels even less warm with the cover on it. The disc is a decent size and the paw print cover is very cute, but the disc is very hard, so my cat doesn't lay on it; she sleeps around it. The product is supposed to stay warm for 10 hrs or so, but I really don't think it lasts that long otherwise my cat wouldn't cry as much. Overall, it does keep my cat warmer than usual and it's easy to use."
3,"Stays warm, but beware that cats might be picky about sitting on it","I bought this item for the ex-feral cat we adopted when we bought our house (ie, she came with the house). She has a bench with a cushion and cat bed and a cat house lined with towels, but on frigid nights I wanted some sort of heat source for her. I thought this would be awesome, since I have no way to plug in a heated pet bed for her (not that I would outdoors anyway). It warms up just like it's supposed to, and keeps the heat decently well (though not 12 hours, more like 7-8), but since it's hard as a rock the cat won't sit on it. I put it under her bed even and she will curl up on the brick porch or hide in her cat house to avoid it. I finally gave up and let her curl up in her unheated bed in peace.So this could be a good item, especially for a pet with arthritis, but if your cat is indoor I suggest a softer and more inviting product."
1,heating pad,"I thought this heating pad would be soft for my pet to lay on under his blanket, but it turns out this heating pad is hard as a rock! Who or what would want to lay on a rock hard surface? I bought it for my dog's comfort and his arthritic joints, but I think it would be torture for him to lie on this heating pad. If I could return it, I would."
5,snugglesafe,"We purchased the Snugglesafe Heatpad to use outside for our two rabbits. It gets in the teens and below in Ct. overnight, so we wanted to get something that they could get some added warmth from, but didn't have electric cords that they could chew. I heat it in the microwave for the specified time and then I slip it in a cardboard box I made to fit it. I decided against using the furry cover it comes with because they would either chew it up or pee on it a lot. Then, not knowing exactly how long it stays warm for them, I decided to first wrap it in foil after heating and then slip it in the box. This seems to insulate it a little bit better. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone for bunnies!"
5,Worth the money,The first time I saw this product was at my sister's vet clinic. I noticed how these abandoned kittens would cuddle up together on it. I have a cat that is 15yrs old and wanted to provide some extra warmth through our cold winter months. I'm not exactly sure how long it stays warm (I microwave it when I go to work and when I go to bed) but it is very close to what they claim. The disk is hard even after it is warmed up. I didn't buy the snuggle safe cover which I'm sure would make it much softer but I put a soft blanket on top which works well too. I looked around to see if I could get a better deal but I couldn't find it cheaper anywhere else. I would highly recommend this product.
5,The Real Deal,"Plain and simple, this thing does what the makers claim that it does both indoors and outdoors. I put it in a feral cat shelter that I whipped up and it stays hot for 5-7 hours and warm for 12. Kitty is nice and cozy on below-zero nights. To make it more effective, I seated it in a cradle that I created out of self-adhesive foam insulation (used for ducts). The cradle has significantly increased the amount of heat radiating towards kitty. I am impressed."
4,This is a great product,"We've been using these for over a year now and our little stray is never moving out. The product performs wonderfully and as advertised. Like others I wish it was softer, but a thick thermal comforter gets rid of the problem. On especially cold nights, we use two of these. We're in snow country and our kitty is quite happy in his cat house.We've finally worn one out (it doesn't heat anymore) and the other is getting close, but the packaging warned us that this would eventually happen, so we don't feel ripped off."
3,Good product,"I bought this for a stray kitty. The Chicago winters are brutal and didn't want to plug anything inside in the garage (fire hazard) I heat this disc up for about 12 minutes ( I have an older microwave) and it gets warm, although it staying warm for 12 hours which it claims may not be accurate at least not when kept outside in the cold winter weather. Overall, I would recommend this as an alternative to having to use electricity."
3,Hard and rigid but it works....,"The outdoor cat that adopted us, just loves this heating disk. It's too large to put in his outdoor condo we built, so we opted to place it under the mound of blankets on the floor of the garage. Needless to say he seems to really like it and I'd say he has come to expect it on those cold, wet and windy days. We heat ours for 7 minutes and leave it in the microwave for one minute before taking it out (with oven type gloves for safety purposes) and placing it in the furry cover that comes with it. Our heating disk doesn't get 'too hot' and I'm not sure how long it stays warm. Honestly, I wish it would get a bit warmer. So, I may heat it a little longer than the directions say, to see if that helps. And I wish the product wasn't so darn hard and rigid..."
5,Guy loves it!,"My aunt suggested this product when I mentioned that I was thinking of getting a heated pet bed. Fortunately my cat Guy took to this right away. He's an older boy, recently adopted from the Humane Society. He gets the shivers when he lays on our cold floors. It takes him forever to stop shivering, even when I hold him under a blanket. He can be nervous though--I just bought him a cushy pet bed that he refuses to lay on. So I was worried he wouldn't like the disk, but honestly, it's bringing him more bliss than catnip! Another thing to note is that it does come with a cover--I wasn't sure that it did since the photo didn't show one."
5,Suggle Save Heat Disc,Bought this for my outdoor kitty. It stays warm for about 11-12 hours when I sandwhich it between a blanket and the bottom of the kitty bed. He is loving it...especially when we dip into the high 20s this weekend.
3,SnuggleSafe Heatpad,Item is as described except that it is very hard. I expected that from reading reviews but it should be listed in the product info. May not be good for older pets with hip problems since it is hard as a rock. Holds heat for a long time though.
2,Doesn't live up to expectations.,Doesn't really provide the kind of warmth you would expect. It definately does not give anywhere close to 12 hours. I doubt any outdoor pet would derive much comfort from this product.
3,Very Good Product,The SnuggleSafe Pet Heating Pad seems to work well. I just pop it into my microwave for about 6 minutes and it stays warm for several hours. I use it in an outside enclosure I use for homeless cats. It helps warm the space along with the outside kennel heating pad which I have plugged in. It especially helps on very cold days.
3,SnuggleSafe Pet Heating Pad,"Product seems to need to be heated 2 or more minutes longer than guidelines suggest. I am heating for almost 8 minutes but based on my microwave watts, I should only be heating up to 5 minutes. That just didn't get the object hot and it did not hold heat at 5 minutes. I could touch it with my bare hands and not need to have a cover on it to touch it.I increased the heating time by 30 seconds on a daily basis until I reached 8 minutes. Now it seems to get hot and stay hot but still not near the 10 hours I was expecting it to hold the heat. Am I doing something wrong? Do a significant number of people have to heat the object longer than the directions suggest?I want to make this product work as my dog is quite cold during the day. I appreciate any positive input anyone can offer. Thanks."
4,Great heat for my Chihuahua puppy,"I purchased this heating pad at the beginning of winter for my 5 month old Chihuahua puppy, and she and I both love it!I knew I wanted to get something to help keep her warm in her play pen area during the mornings when I'm at work, but I felt nervous getting something electric and having a cord. The SnuggleSafe seemed perfect, and I've been very happy with how long the heat lasts. I microwave it and then put it under the pillow of her bed. She doesn't bother it, but the one down side is that the thickness of the pad makes her bed puff up really high, almost as high as the sides of her bed.The pad came with thorough instructions and a little felt cover for the pad in a brown and black pawprint pattern. Cute!"
4,Keeps my dog warm,"I have an 8 lb chihuahua who is cold most of the time. When it's especially cold out, I throw the snugglesafe in the microwave and it gets pretty warm. He snuggles up to keep his paws more. He hasn't tried to chew it or destroy it, so it has passed that test so far. After 8 hours you can still feel some warmth, but obviously it doesn't hold the temperature as high as an electric heater. I like this because I know my dog won't electrocute himself and he is still warm. I think I may buy one for my cat."
5,The Best Pet Heater,"I bought this for my Italian Greyhound puppy and I love it. I was nervous to get a plug in heater for his kennel for obvious reasons. With this product I just pop it in the microwave while I eat breakfast and get ready to leave the house, put it in my dog's kennel and never worry about his safety, or how cold he is, while I'm at work all day. It's awesome!"
3,pet heating pad,"I purchased this product hoping my dog would like it, as she is crazy about my heating pad..however, I think it is too hard and she is not that crazy about it... She tries to scratch it out of her bed.. It doesn't get very warm, but, it does get warm enough so that you can tell it does hold heat.. I would think an outside animal when it is really cold would probably appreciate it... (i think)"
4,Stays warm for hours,"This is a great product that can literally stay warm all night. My indoor cats love it, but I found out about it from friends who do animal rescue and feral cat T&R. They use them while feral cats are being acclimated to a new location during the colder months; the cats are in a ""hutch"", or large cage, while they get used to their surroundings and are given these disks for warmth. Be careful to make sure you follow the directions, overheating the gel will cause the outer plastic casing to bubble up and then you'll have to throw it away. I only wish it was wider and flatter to be able to put under a blanket more easily- the disk is smaller than an animal so they're laying on a lump in the blanket. Still, my cats do not seem to mind and it's kind of funny to watch them all try to pile up on one disk while another is heating up."
3,snugglesafe heatpad,"I bought this item for my Lab as she has elbow dysplasia and I didn't want to worry about electrical wires or over heating. It does keep the heat like it reports..the fleece cover is important as the disc gets quite hot. The only down side is that the disc is very hard; if it was a gel like item it would cushion her elbows better. She will only lay on it for a couple of minutes which defeats the purpose. We may use it for a fanny warmer at the football games but as for fido, it's not exactly what we needed...lesson learned."
5,Great for Outdoor Dog/Cat Houses,I have always worried about the outdoor cats in the neighborhood. I have a house for them but it is still cold in the winter. With the Snuggle Safe Pet Heating Pat the inside of the house and blankets stay warm for around for 8 hours. It is great!!!
5,Snuggle Safe,"Our two kitties, Dooley and Cocoa, love their heaters. They don't get along at all, but when we put the heaters on the bed, they'll sleep together all night long! Thank you Snuggle Safe!"
4,Good for people too!,"This definitely warms like it says it will and stays warm overnight. When the cat doesn't want it, it's actually nice for me to use outside or when I just don't want to turn the thermostat up inside. BUT like other reviewers have said, it's really hard and has no flex to it. I haven't gotten the cat to lay on it of her own free will, but I know she gets cold and she does seem to enjoy it when I slide it under her where she's already laying.I bought a second one for the local stray cats because the first one worked properly. If nothing else, it's a worthwhile purchase because it keeps me warm if the cats reject it."
3,Had to return it.,I have a barn cat and I thought he would like the warmth of the disc. It warmed up nicely in the microwave and stayed warm for a very long time. I set it under the blanket in the cat bed and the cat didn't go in the bed. Apparently the cat didn't like the hardness of the disc. I didn't know the barn cat was fussy. I would've thought the warmth of the disc would be a joy to him. I guess I was wrong. It probably would work fine on other animals that aren't fussy.
4,My cats love this!,"We have two cats, one 5 the other 15 years old. They both love these, especially the older one. We use these in the carrier for car rides when it's cold. I would definitely recommend this if you have animals that like to stay warm or have issues with arthritis."
5,The cats in your life will love you...,"My pet sitter told me about this cool little disc. It looks like a frisbee. After you heat it in your microwave for 6 minutes, it emits heat of 120 degrees Farenheit for 12 hours. I use it to keep a homeless kitty that has adopted me warm at night. I just heat the disc, stick it in a box under some blankets on my porch, and the kitty is ecstatic. He sits on it like it's an egg, purring. It's safe and very effective on cold winter nights. This is a really great gift for anyone who loves cats."
3,1 flaw,"I bought this disk a few years back to help keep my kitty warm during the cold winter months. it preforms perfectly, storing heat for hours after warming... unfortunatly, it's hard and my cat doesn't like sleeping on it. I've placed it under a blanket, she doesn't want it. I've placed it in her beloved kitty condo, she didn't want it. I even placed it under the thick cushion of her rather large & also beloved pet bed, she slept at the other end. I am now looking at a self-warming mat to try out on her. I'm hoping the flat structure & soft cover will appeal to her."
2,Warm but not soft,"I bought this for my parents' older chihuahua, who loves to snuggle up to the central air vent for warmth. The warmth is great and continuous - but the disc is really hard (probably a safety design) - I had to put it under a pillow or wrap in blankets - at which point the warmth was weak and took a long time to make it through to the poor pup. A softer casing would improve the product a great deal."
5,snugglesafe,"We used this product for a newborn kitten we rescued. It was recommended to us by a cat rescue league and we found it much better than blankets alone. Please pay close attention to the wattage instructions for heating it up, consider the animal's age and size and even though it already comes with a flannel cover, PLEASE put a blanket on top of it before puttiing the animal on it. We loved it and it really helped keep the kitten warm."
5,Snugglesafe Pet Heatpad,"My Jack Russell likes to go places with me in the car, but I worried about him getting cold during Vermont winters ... in Googling for something that would provide heat but not involve electricity, I happened upon the Snugglesafe ... it has been very successful ... it stays nice and warm for at least four hours ... I slip it under the pillow cover in his car crate and he settles right in with it ... has not bothered it at all and appears to appreciate it ... I would highly recommend this product."
4,SnuggleSafe Heatpad,Kitty loves the heated disk. Comes with a protective cover that is nice. Heat it up for 6 minutes and it will stay warm for approx. 9 hours.
1,Danger to pets and people,Manufacturer does not back this product. I complained that after one use liquid shot out and burnt my hand. I was told that only happens when the animals chew on the ends or when its warmed up too long. They were not surprised. Would not issue a refund but offered to replace the disc with a new one. No thanks. This disk is snuggle unsafe. Not worth the risk.
2,Cold cats still...,I bought this for my 3 outdoor cats and they are still cold. I spent quite bit of time searching for a warming 'bed' to help them out in the cold weather and settled for these. Don't waste your money.
1,defective,"I have had these for years and so far they all worked great.. I however ordered from Amazon about two wks ago.. I paid for two day shipping and it took five days to get it .. then the second time I heated it .. it burst.. now I do know how to work these things , like I said before.. I have had them and used them for outdoor animals for years.. I am so upset over this.. of course I dont know who to contact on amazon to complain to.. I threw it away and am now using an old one.. I will re order but not from Amazon .. and I intend to fight the shipping charges with my credit card company.. good luck ..u are going to need it"
1,DOG HATES IT,"Our dog won't sleep on it. I think he's a princess. He chewed it for a while, then slept as far away as he could from it and still be on his bedding. I will try again this winter, and bury it deeper into the bedding, but he's either afraid of it or doesn't like its hard, frisbee like surface. And I covered it well, but will put more layers on top. he is very finicky in all circumstances, little hair and very bony. maybe a fatter dog would like it, but then that one would be warm enough. I'd return it except it's chewed on!"
1,Allergic Reaction,"We are very certain that our dog had an allergic reaction to this heatable disk. At the time we got it and used it he got very ill. He had to got to the vet, was on an IV overnight, etc. It was scary. A few days later after he was almost back to normal, the disk had come in contact with his body and he broke out in hives nearly 10 minutes later. Too much of a coincidence if you ask me."
1,Not so good...,"I read other reviews about this product and I decided to buy two for my ""adopted outside"" kitties. I put the product in the microwave as directed and it did not heat up that much - it was barely warm. I was nervous about microwaving it for a longer period of time because of the warnings on the label. A couple of the cats did lay on it, but others did not. I think this is a good idea, but poor execution."
1,worthless,Didn't work for us. Pups wouldn't go near it. Why choose a rock hard disc (albeit swaddled in a towel) when mom is much more comfy.
5,Great Bed Warmers,This bed warmer is wonderful especially for feral cats. It keeps its warmth for over 12 hours. One of the best investments I have made for outside animals.
3,wish it could be warmer and last longer,"I purchased it for my feral cat Tybolt who lives in my backyard and around the neighborhood. I warmed it up according to the instruction but the pad is just lukewarm. After I put the pad under the blanket I couldn't feel any warmth at all. So next time I added one minute to the instructed time when warming, but the pad was still just lightly warm. It's hardly adequate for indoor let alone for outdoor use in winter. I like the design and the simplicity without involving wires and electricity. But I just wish it would be warmer and last longer for outdoor in winter. I ended up using the hand warmers that i bought bulks from Costco which amazingly last straight 8 hours and warm enough even under a thin blanket. I use two pairs at a time, spreading them out under the blanket. But I would like to use something that I don't need to throw away every day. The Heating Pad concept is wonderful. I just need it to be warmer for my feral cat."
4,Great little cage warmer,"We have an outdoor cat that we adopted from a neighbor. We fixed him a bed inside an airlilne approved pet carrier and lined it with rolls of bubble wrap wrapped in fleece and sherpa floor and totally covered the carrier with carpeting. We then put in two of these warmers. They have kept him toasty on these cold northwest nights...right at freezing and below. (Oh, I bought this one because I've had another that's been in use 8+ years now) Would highly recommend this product. I like that it's safe."
5,Wonderful product,"I got this to keep the stray that adopted us cozy in her outside dog house. This product keeps her toasty all night long. She will even ""yell"" at me when she wants it and nudge it to make sure I take the hint. She is now addicted to it and I'm buying a back up to make sure she never has to go without it. This product is wonderful and I highly recommend it."
5,Keeps stray cats nice and warm!,"My two stray cats love it. This is a hard plastic disk with a somewhat fuzzy/soft cover. But I recommended putting a blanket on top to give it some more cushion. I put the heating pad on top of their cat bed, and to add some more comfort.I purchased the K&H Self-Warming Pet Crate Pad to put on top of it, and it works great. Both cats are in the middle of the self-warming pad on top of were the heating pad is."
4,Real Nice Heat Supply,"I bought two of these heatpads for a couple of feral cats that I am caretaking for. They live in a outdoor windproof woodshed, snuggled inside two wooden boxes with blankets. They can come & go as they please, with cat doors located on the shed walls. We live in NE Pa. and it gets cold up here. I didn't want to use anything electric to generate heat for them, fearful of something going wrong, so I decided on these heatpads. It was the best move I made in a long time. They work great, and I get a good 9 or 10 hours heat out of them before they need to go back into the microwave. They are worth every dime I spent, and I recommend them highly."
3,Not quite as snuggly as imagined,"While I was excited about this, my cat doesn't seem so excited. It doesn't seem to create the kind of warmth I imagined, and if you put it under a blanket in the cat box, it doesn't really warm up the blanket. My cat seems to spend less time sleeping in the box than when there was just a towel in there. However, my friend's cat LOVES its Snuggle Safe, and I'm glad that there is something I can provide when my cat refuses to come inside in cold weather, even if he doesn't seem to ""use"" it much."
2,Not for large dogs that chew!,"My disks lasted less than 6 hours with my dogs. One was chewed to the point of not being safe to heat and I still can't find the other one. The disks also did not seem to get as hot as claimed, even though I heated them according to the instructions (2 1/2 min using an 1800 watt microwave). I put them in the dog houses at 6:30 am at about 38 degrees outdoor temp. The chewed up disk was stone cold by noon. The product is probably better suited to smaller animals or older dogs who don't chew. My dogs are 3 and 6 yrs old."
4,A little sad!,"After reading all of the great reviews I bought two of these for my bottle fed kittens. I am upset because after only a month of using them, one of them started leaking and I had to throw it away. My microwave wattage is 1250, and I never heated the warmer up for more than 3 minutes, and (as the directions say) heating it only when it was cold! I bought 2 so I could always have a ""cold"" one to heat up when the warm one started cooling down."
5,Worth its weight in gold,"This is the greatest invention, or pretty close. I have a feral cat that I have taken in and I can't have him inside because he marks and wants to eat my three year old son, but I wanted him to be comfortable outside. I also didn't want a bunch of wires that I had to weave through the window (no outside plugs) and then freeze us out by having an open window so that I could plug in a heating pad. This takes minutes in microwave and while I don't think it keeps heat for eight hours, it keeps it pretty warm for at least five and that is for the coldest part of night. I usually put it under my cat's blanket (it is VERY hard) later in the night, like right before I'm going to bed so that he is warmer in the coldest part of night.You can tell that he loves it and dances on his back two feet when he sees me coming with this heating pad. Very worth it and I will be buying another one just to have."
5,Wonderful for strays.,I bought these heating disks for the stray cat's outside. They are wonderful we heat them at night and during the harsh winter day's and they keep those poor animals outside warm.
3,Snuggle Safe Review,I am using this product for a Hedgehog. It works really well for at night to help keep the cage warmer. He doesn't actually sleep on it but not having to worry about him going into hibernation is nice. I would recommend this product for small animals. It is a little bulky so make sure you have a larger cage.
4,Great,Great product. I didnt expect it to work as well as it did. It really holds heat for a long period of time. The only negative thing I could say would be is it is a little too thick. My dog isn't thrilled with it being placed under her blankets.
3,Ok but other reviews warn you,I checked the reviews before I purchased. They warned me that it was too hard and the heat didn't last the night. I bought it anyway and sure enough they were right. At least I knew what I was getting into so I can't really complain. I wish there was something better. I use it outside so an electrical plug isn't an option (I'm afraid of electrocution or fire). This is the best option I could find at this time.
5,"Great product, excellent customer service !","I purchased this item to keep our feral cats warm. It's perfect in every way ~ heat for 5-6 minutes in the microwave, tuck it into their bedding and you're good to go. No muss, no fuss and it keeps them warm for 10 hours. I put it out in the AM when I feed and again in the evening to keep them snuggily all through the night. I had an issue with the initial item that I purchased through Martha's Pets which was defective and it was replaced immediately. Martha's responded immediately and appropriately to all concerns.Great item..very happy.. warm feral kitties ~ it's all good !"
5,great for older pets,My 1 cat is 18+ years old and this is great to put behind the blanket he sleeps on. It keeps him toasty warm.He certainly appreciates it.
