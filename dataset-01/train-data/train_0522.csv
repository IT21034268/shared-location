3,Better is out there for less money...,I had high hopes for this unit but was only marginally impressed. You need a wall on just the right plane to flat mount. I tried suspending from ceiling but found this inconvenient and did not enhance reception quality. I settled on an old Bic Beam box and was far more convenient and sensitive than this Terk.
3,"OK, but that's all","I've been on a long quest to find an antenna that would bring in my favorite FM station, 60 miles away. I live in hilly, rural country -- but I'm on top of one of those hills. The simple dipole that came with my receiver didn't receive this station at all. I then tried several amplified antennas that sit table-top. One of them got me very fuzzy reception. I then tried this Terk FM-50, exterior-mounted on the side of my house. It was gave me reception, though with considerable static, even after experimenting with different locations, positions. [Eventually, I tried an omnidirectional Weingard HD-6010 -- mast-mounted (short length of pipe) from the high ceiling inside my garage. Great reception; no static.] This Terk FM-50 might work better for you than it did for me, but based on my experience, I'd recommend a simple omnidirectional mast-mount."
3,"Not completely satisfied, but it works","Well I was hoping for the best when I ordered this antenna, I have been fighting with reception for some time now using a dipole antenna and finally broke down and bought this one from Terk, it was only one station that is about 25 air miles away, but my favorite to listen to. When I first plugged it in I had nothing better then what the dipole was picking up, then I started moving it around to different locations and finally found a spot the reception is tolerable, actually the best spot was right in the middle of the floor in my office standing vertical, go figure. Anyway, I do still have a bit of static and have to run the FM receiver in Mono mode and the location of the antenna is not in the spot I wanted to put it which was isolated from view."
2,No better than a dipole antenna,Does not work. Installed it on top of roof. No better than dipole antenna. The amplifier had very little affect.
2,Didn't Help Noticeably With FM Reception,"Although nice looking, this antenna made absolutely no difference at all to help our poor reception. Fortunately we were able to return it once we found this out (thanks!)"
5,Terk FM-Pro is incredible,I have had an issue with poor FM reception in South Tampa and just purchased an HD FM tuner that would not hold an HD signal. This thing made all the difference. I now have strong and clear signals. And I just put the unit (all 4 feet of it) on top of a tall furniture cabinet. I wish I had had this unit for the past several years as I have struggled to get a good signal. I am very satisfied.
4,Terk FM Powered Antenna,"My favorite FM station is about 90 miles from the house. My car radio receives the signal OK about 90% of the time, but my Radio Shack dual di-pole antenna failed to give a usable signal. I replaced the 300 ohm lead-in from this antenna with shielded coax (as recommended by another reviewer) and instantly received a better signal, but still not usable.At this point I ordered the Terk FM Pro antenna. Amazing! I received a clear signal with no hint of background noise of any kind! I then attached the power unit to the antenna, but as soon as I switched on the power, I got a hiss and a lot of background noise! I tried using the ""amplifier"" at both ends of my 75 ohm shielded coax. When it was connected at the antenna end, the results were better, but still not as good as with the antenna alone. Maybe some guru in the audience can explain that to me . . . Bottom line, I am happy to report that I can now enjoy hiss and static free, crystal clear, FM music in my shop!"
4,AM Antenna,Does an excellent job picking up AM stations at our home in Costa Rica. I recommend it for areas with weak radio signals.
3,Superflirt,"I actually got this book because I interviewed the author on the radio and promised her I would read it. Some decent advice, I guess..."
1,Cosmo in book form,"The writing style turned me off immediately. I don't care if you like flirting with anything that moves. Just get to the body language.Once I started reading the ""meat"" of the book (sandwiched between god-awful, cheesy, poorly shot pictures) I realized I had wasted my money. Really? People point at the things they want? Thanks so much for the insight.If you're looking to actually learn something, avoid this book."
1,Elementary Knowledge,"Reading body-language is a process of evaluating constant change and not just looking for some simple poses as this book is meant to make you believe....If you're interested in body-language, get some scientific books on the subject instead and most of all open your eyes, watch and think!"
3,"Good read... to brush up, not to learn anything really new...","This book was a good read, a fun read, but did not provide any new or revolutionary information. Good for brushing up on your skills, but not for learning new ones..."
1,Shows how pathetically manipulative adolescents can be,"This book is really not for mature adults. It tries to show how to manipulate a man into feeling differently about a woman. Basically, it is a substitute for real intimacy and developing authentic relationships. I recommend guys to read this, just so they can tell when they are being manipulated. But this really is for giggly girls."
5,Awesome!,"I've seen Tracey on Date Patrol and it started me thinking about my body language. I bought superflirt on a whim because it looked like a fun read but it's actually changed my life! I'm now incredibly good at reading other people's body language which helps enormously in all areas of my life, not just romantically. Everyone should have a copy of superflirt and it should be recommended reading in high schools!"
4,"Pretty good, if Anglo-centric","This book is funny, colorful, and warm, and will put a smile on your face. The flirting techniques are basic, but for those who are just starting out, it does cover the fundamentals.I do want to point out, though, that it's what I would call Anglo-centric. It covers the courtship style expected in the white Anglo-Saxon culture; other cultures are quite different, so this is something to keep in mind."
5,Fairy Tail part 2 HayateFreakz Review.,"I got everything at the same time so its the same Review as part 4. I was really happy I just love the serie and I watching on English atm and its awesome I just love it, the Package had taking kinda much damage but it didn't do any harm to the DVD's :). in short the DVD is really good but the package you put it in what did you do ? looked like someone have played with it like a football :P although the DVD was nothing wrong with (^.^)"
5,We See Not Every Guild Is A Friend To Fairy Tail,"With this set we see an introduction to a more disturbing and ruthless rival to the Fairy Tail guild and after a tragic event the Fairy Tail members are out for blood low and behold any enemies that get in their way. The series gets more entertaining and addictive as you continue to watch and the characters become more endearing and entertaining as you see them during their missions and background episode storylines. The animation and soundtrack fir perfectly and the voice cast are great again Funimation has picked a perfect cast for the roles in the series and of course the Japanese voice cast are great as well. Now we just have to wait until the fourth set comes out and again I truly hope that Funimation releases the entire series on dvd instead of stopping production like on the series D-Gray man, but considering how popular this series is I find that highly doubtful."
4,Part 2 is better than part 1,The 4 heroes are on Galuna island trying to lift a curse. The villagers are under a curse that turns them into demons. An evil wizard is resurrecting a monster that will destroy the world. The monster has a connection to Gray's past and stirs lots of anger and sorrow within him. We also find out why he's always hanging around in his underwear all the time. Later in this volume Lucy is kidnapped by the element 4 sorcerers and a huge battle erupts trying to save her.This volume picks up where the 1st left off. It's a lot of fun. If you liked part 1 you'll like part 2. Enjoy!
3,Verry thin plastic,"I think this may be the only high-back litter pan liner available, which is too bad, because the plastic is really too thin. It does not stand up long to claw scratching. I have used other liners for flat pans which have much thicker plastic.By the way, sprinkling a little baking soda on the liner before putting kitty litter in helps neutralize the urine order. Very nice!"
3,PetMate Litter pan liners,I recently purchased these liners and I'm not real happy with them. They're not as durable as some others I've used. I usually only change the whole pan out once a week but with these I have to change it more often. With the daily scooping they seem to tear so a lot of the litter goes through and defeats the purpose of the liner. I won't buy them again.
4,"Decent pan liners, but don't use them alone.","These pan liners work great in my high-backed, covered cat box. They're easy to apply and they fit very nicely in a pan that is unevenly shaped - not all pan liners do. I tend to use them in conjunction with a disposable dry pad (like the ones for training dogs) underneath because the plastic is very, very thin. If you keep your cats claws sharp and they like to scratch around in the box after making a deposit at the Bank of Poop, these bags will easily tear. Use with a pad, or be prepared to spend some extra time cleaning the inside of your box."
1,Revamped with Thinner Plastic--BOO!,"These used to be fantastic litter box liners--thick, durable, a perfect fit, and easy to lift with the drawstring feature. No more. The plastic is now so thin that my kitties claw through it in no time. When it's time to lift and dispose, the litter pours through huge holes faster than I can transfer to the waste can. I'm left with a litter box full of used litter--so what's the point of the liner?"
4,"Actually, pretty good for the price....","I was expecting them to be rather cheap quality because they were so inexpensive, but they actually were nicer than the craftsman pieces we have. No complaints here!"
4,"Eat, drink, sleuth","In the light-mystery genre, this was an enjoyable read. No Dorothy Sayers, mind you, but great to read at the end of the day, especially with a glass of wine. Wonderful depictions of the wine country!"
2,Cute book,It was okay...pleasant. I wouldn't want to download another of her books. I did learn a little more about wine.
4,Fun mystery in wine country.,"Fun beach read, especially if you like food and wine. Good descriptions of the Napa Valley, a favorite place of mine. Appealing characters."
4,"Sharpshooter, great book","Very good book, I would like to read more selections written by this author. With a combination of food and wine rolled into a mystery how can you go wrong."
4,Interesting blend,"An interesting blend of fine foods, wine, and mystery among the Napa Valley eaters, drinkers, and growers. In some parts the food preparation was equally as entertaining as the ""whodoneit"". The reader is also exposed to the growing of food and wine and the problems associated. I am not sure how well it was all blended into the same story, but it was interesting and worth the read."
4,got to have the beach boys,"My son asked if I had old tapes from the sixties (he didnt know that was before eight tracks even) so I got on amazon to send him some janice, hendrix, sgt pepper, ravi, dylan, creedance and thought about the other element and included the beach boys. They were every bit as important to the early sixties, espec in so cal. He's enjoying them."
4,Are You A Beach Boys Fan? Are You Pressed For Time?,"If so, then this Best Of The Beach Boys is for you (my copy is entitled Hits Of The Beach Boys is indentical) as it only runs to 25 mintues!The 10 songs are from the 1963-66 era and could easily been in chronological order, but are not.The quality of the tracks is not in question, they are the original classics which will always invoke careless days surfing, meeting girls and driving dragster cars.Most fans will want much more than this offering, it certainly whets the appitite!"
5,Oldies but Goodies,"I grew up listening to the Beach Boys and watching movies about them and another group, ""Jan & Dean""."
2,Garmin iQue M5,"Sync with Outlook dosen't all ways happen automatically, have to reset unit. GPS can be up to several hundred yards off actual position. Dosen't all ways recognize turn was not taken or that you are on an adjacent road"
4,Garmin iQm5 used unit,"The unit arrived within 19 days (max of 25 days called out in order), was in good condition and appears to be fully functional. I purchased this item to be a backup for my trusty iQm5 purchased 5 years ago."
2,I prefer the M3 over the M5,"I had an M3 before and I regret replacing it with the M5. The M5 is not user-friendly at all. You would think that after using the M3 for several months, it would be easy to use the M5. The user interface on the M5 is almost totally different. It doesn not work well with Outlook. All my contacts in my M3 were all listed in the Que program by default, but in M5 you have to add them manually, but it gave me the wrong coordinates - all Contacts that I added in My Locations have the same coordinates - go figure. Or, you have to reenter the address on your way out even though it's already in your Contacts. Built-in speaker is so bad. It was better in M3. You have to use the stylus all the time. The program is not intuitive at all. I am glad to find out Garmin discontinued the M5. I miss my M3 - my only problem with it is the battery is not replaceable."
2,Buy if you want to be on the bleeding edge,"I like garmin products. Seems support for this one is a bit dicey.Pro's - It's a garmin. Most of their products are great, and their mapping software is good.Con's - Bluetooth. Doesn't appear it works with much. Garmin tech support admits it doesn't work with any keyboard or headset. They don't admit to what it DOES work with. Seems they are relying on users to discover that. Documentation can be a bit sketchy too. Again, relying on users to find and report the bugs. If want to pay a lot for bleeding edge technology, this is it."
2,Not suitable for use in a moving vehicle,"It's partly my fault, of course. I bought this to use on my motorcycle. I thought the small size, especially the flat body, would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag. I also bought a special handlebar mount for it. Unfortunately, I've had nothing but trouble with it. It's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes. Whether you're driving a car or a motorcycle, it's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route. Maybe it was intended for pedestrians only. The user interface for the GPS is not intuitive (at least, not for me), Worse still, it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes. The Garmin helpline in the UK could only tell me to reset the machine each time. Not very helpful. My guess is that the combination of palm PC and GPS was too much for Garmin to handle. They should probably just stick to GPS."
5,to good to be true,I use it at work evey day and let my help us it and we all love it. Very easy to use in one car or many cars. Very easy to use.
5,I saw the original version in 1972.,"The original uncut film was a masterpiece, and I will never forget it. Too many of the ""classics"" are shortened... I am always disappointed by them. I will find an original..."
3,"Good, and with just a little tweaking could be even better","I think keeping a log of your daily exercise & food intake can be very beneficial; putting it all down on paper and reviewing it periodically motivates me to stay the course in my goal of leading a healthier lifestyle and also lets me see what areas I need to work on improving. However, this book really needs bigger spaces to write in, especially the meals sections, which seem tiny and cramped. I'd also prefer it if it was set up to check off your daily intake of fruits, vegetables, multi-grains, etc the way it is to monitor water consumption. I do enjoy the inspiring daily ""words to live by"", and as a cancer survivor who finds something positive in each new day, I really like the space to write in ""a beautiful thing"" everyday."
5,Excellent book!!!,"This book by Leslie Sansone is one of the best around!! Her walking program is wonderful and this journal most certainly goes along with that! Thanks for the quick shipment. I would purchase from this seller again! Thanks, Kim"
3,Somewhat dissapointing,"I am not particularly fond of this book. If you're interested in reading Schonberg's view on the pedagogical aspects of music, then you'll love this book. I, however, did not find it that appealing. It is a very philosophical, thought-provoking book; but, it is NOT your typical music theory book. There is a good bit of information, but it is often presented in a very cumbersome manner, and difficult to understand. This is partly due to Schonberg's aptness to go on philosophical tirades after intoducing every new concept."
5,"Very good, but know what you are getting into","A very good book indeed, making many interesting points not just about the theory of harmony, but also on music in general, and on art in general.The author inserted quite a few quite large digressions, so if you want a book that really sticks to the subject of harmony, you should probably buy another book.If you want to learn about harmony as well as about the larger context, this is probably the book to buy."
3,Worked good for a while.,"I bought this item to remove 4 one-way screws from my vehicle. I bought the #12 thinking it would fit 12mm screws, but I think it's actually for about 10mm screws. Nevertheless, I was able to remove the tight screws just by pressing down hard. I was very impressed. The only down side was that the bolt the holds the middle piece in place didn't tighten very well (maybe I stripped it), so it kept slipping and had to be re-tightened. For this reason, I am replacing the security screws with normal ones to avoid this hassle in the future. It did the job though."
5,AMAZINGLY REAL.,"THIS TITLE SHOULD BE GIVEN 5 STARS BY ANY OPERA LISTENER. THIS WAS MY VERY FIRST OPERA AND FEWER THAT I HAVE BOUGHT AFTERWARDS (EVEN THOUGH HIGHER PRIZED), GIVE YOU SUCH A REAL SOUND. YOU CAN EVEN HEAR THE FOOT STEPS OF THE PERFORMERS IN THE SCENARIO, AND THE PUBLIC LAUGHING WHEN THE COUNT HIDES IN THE SAME PLACE THAT CHERUBINO WAS USING PREVIOUSLY WITHOUT NOTICING EACH OTHER; AND THE PERFORMERS, THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES YOU CAN TRANSPORT YOURSELF IN TIME TO THE VIENNA STAATSOPER. OF NOTE IS THAT I HAVE OTHER VERSIONS OF THE SAME OPERA BUT I WON'T REVEAL THE NAMES FOR ETHIC PURPOSES."
4,Excellent look at the history of the VW Beetle in motorsport,This book gives the reader a valuable insight into the world of aircooled VW motorsport from the early days of VW Beetle development to the modern day Kafer and Beetle Cup racing. Most of the photos are black and white with a center section in colour. There is one factory drawing of a front 'stoneguard' and many uninformed readers will be surprised to learn of the successes of VW Beetles and derivitives in rallies and other motorsport competitions. A very good book to have if you're a VW Beetle fan!
4,Better than many other shark attack movies,"""Malibu Shark Attack"" is what you expect, but a little better thanmost movies of this type. If you like ""Creature features,"" this is agood one. If you don't like that type of movie, you won't like this.I found it quite entertaining."
1,Looks like ^%$$%^!!!,"I never even bought this movie from Amazon, and a good thing I didnt , This movie looks retarded and looks really fake, it looks like a another shark growing off the sharks face, not a recommened buy I beg you!!!!!!!!"
2,Below average shark movie,"I saw Swamp Shark and 2-headed shark before I saw this one and I must say those two were just a little better.This movie isn't horrible, but it's not that great either. The acting is better than 2-Headed Shark and so is the CGI. But, not as good as Swamp Shark CGI. The girls in this movie isn't as good as the girls in 2-Headed Shark.The acting here is better than the acting in the 2-headed shark, but not as good as the acting in Swamp Shark.The story is about the same for all three movies. Some kind of event happens and now we have dangerous shark in the water.Goblin Sharks are the worse shark I like for all three movies.If you like B rated shark movies than you probably going to watch this either way. Otherwise, you don't need to watch this, if you don't have to."
4,Malibu Shark Attack: Maneater Series,Malibu Shark Attack is a good shark show. Got into shark shows aftert Jaws made its appearence. If you like shark shows this one will do.
4,Good book... but...,"I greatly enjoyed the tales of Tarzan as presented in Tarzan Alive. The problem I have is this... I haven't read the original source material. I thought the Definitive Biography would include a real biography, when instead it often just contrasts events with the original stories. Thus, it would have been helpful if I had read all the original stories before delving into Tarzan Alive. That being said, this book was a very good read, and I look forward to someone reprinting Phillip Jose Farmer's His Apocalyptic Life so I can see the true life of Doc Savage as well. Thank you Bison Frontiers for helping me find this book that I had heard so much about!"
4,Very good...however...,"Great new edition of a terrific book. This Bison Books edition adds Farmer's ""exclusive interview with Lord Greystoke (from Esquire) and ""Extracts from the memoirs of ""Lord Greystoke"" (from ""Mother Was A Lovely Beast""). The problem being, the editors placed these at the start of the book, instead of added as appendices, and I feel they slow the book down. Also, this edition does not include the Wold Newton family tree from earlier editions. Great cover art by ""Jean-Paul Goude"", also originally from Esquire (1972).Still, recommended for any Farmer, Burroughs, or Tarzan fan."
3,Wrong purchase,"I purchased this product thinking it has RCA connections on both sides of the plate. I was wrong. The plate has RCA connections on the front of the plate and solder connections on the rear of the plate. That does not make the plate bad, just not what I expected. Maybe I read the description incorrectly, but just be aware of how this plate installs as now I have a $5.00 plate that I am sure I will never use, and that I know is just not worth sending back."
3,Price is right,Just another wall jack. Quality is good. I use it to run subwoofer rca through ceiling so I dont have to have cord under carpet. Just got the extra coax in case i ever want to run another tv position. You better be good with solder. My gorilla solder jobs did not hold up when pushing plates into wall. This is more for pros.
5,Loved it!!!,"This book was sooo good. The story was funny, filled with lots of drama and really shows that it is possible to love two people. I loved it and I felt that the author did a fabulous job. I recommend that you go out and buy this book!"
4,Better plastic please!,"Good sound and low cost but the smell and taste still strong after a month airing out on the counter. I hope the plastic smell will fade soon.I have a cheap HOHNER ""POCKET PAL"" and it's great a 5 STAR value for a beginner or casual user."
2,Not worth the money,"I have other harmonica's but thought I'd like a set of blues harps. I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good. Wow, was I wrong. Too hard to push notes through them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
2,"Even with low expectations, this product was disappointing","Due to the price, I was not expecting much when I purchased this product, just basic set of serviceable harmonicas. Still this set turned out to be somewhat disappointing.All of the harps in the set I received work, but they play very stiff. This is suppose to be a ""blues"" set, but I find it more difficult to get notes to bend on these harps than on most of the other diatonic harmonicas I own.In addition the harps all have textured plastic cover plates that are uncomfortable to slide your lips over while you are playing.One positive thing I can say is the case is nicer than those included with other similar sets I have purchased over the years."
1,very poor quality - 3 of them dont work :(,very poor quality - 3 of them dont work :( the ones that do work sound great but 3 out of 7 is too many to be defective :( prepare for extreme disappointment
3,Decent set of harmonics,"These harmonicas are decent-- an excellent value for the price. The case has a strange plastic odor to it and this transferred to the harps, so I will be using a different case shortly. The Harmonica's are of decent quality and tone. I am happy with the purchase."
2,you get what you pay for,"at 20$ that breaks out to about $3 a harmonica, it sucks but a $3 harmonica would suck anyways so its fair, but it has a nasty plastic taste and smell to it. kinda like the smell of bad paint. the case is pretty good but my lee oskar won't fit in it so watch out if you want to buy it for the case"
3,harmonica set just okay.,"The harmonicas were of pretty low quality- light plastic. One of the harmonicas has an awful buzz when played--a damaged reed? I guess for a starter set, it would be okay, but the one with the buzzing sound is useless."
4,"You get what you pay for, not perfect, but decent","A few of them work better than others, some pitches are difficult to produce on the defective ones, but a good starter for the harmonica"
2,Poor Quality Control,"I purchased this harmonica set to play along with blues radio. Some of the harps work well, others require more breath and still others work well on the ends but do not blow as well in the middle and so forth. Very lightweight, made of plastic; better to invest in a quality set than this.Comes with a nice padded, two zipper, semi-hatdshell case that won't protect the"
2,save your money,they dont last long found myself starting my own collection of different harmonicas after about a week of using these so just spare a little more money to buy a better one may seem like a good idea at first but you'll realize all you bought was a case
3,eh...,"First harmonicas so I'm not too learned in quality but skill aside, they are pitchy and a number of holes don't work. I'm not completely dissapointed, it's nice to have the Key range w/o buying a chromatic. With that said, I've already started shopping for better harps in my most frequently played keys.Best Regards!"
2,Party favors are not instruments,You are paying for a soft case that comes with disposable party favors. The included harmonicas have brass reeds but are otherwise completely plastic. Very little of the air you blow will make it past the reed resulting in you blowing until your red in the face to get a squeek out of them. Hohner should remove their name from these.For comparison I have a couple of $30 Hohners and my wifes $10 Hohner and both are far superior to these.
4,Pretty good for the price,"I got this set for a friend as a gift, and at first he was a little averse to it because it was plastic, but he was reassured by the Hohner brand, and gave them a shot.It is great for beginners and the included songs helped him get a head start on learning how to play. I would recommend it more toward a younger age bracket, for those who want to move on from the ""My first Harmonica"" from the toy store to something a little more serious."
2,"not bad, but could be better.","Not a bad set, for the price, but certainly needs improvement. Had problems with stuck reeds, out of tune notes (every harp in the set was a touch sharp). Also these harps have pretty large airholes, which makes finding the notes easy, but causes you to reallly work hard to bend and project your sound. Plastic casing has a rough finish, and will leave your lips very chapped and sore after a few minutes of serious playing. The body is also alot thicker than most, making it hard to seat properly at the back of your lips. Would work well for a beginner just looking to explore the instrument, but certainly not good enough for serious musicians."
2,You get what you pay for,"These are worth the $30 you pay for them, but they just do not stand up to a quality harmonica. I am a beginner player and bought a Hohner C Marine Band harmonic to start out and have been playing that for about 6 months. It was time for me to buy harps in a different key and the 7 harmonicas in this set looked like a good way to get a variety of keys at an affordable price--and it is. However, after having learned on a Hohner Marine Band harmonica, there is no comparison in quality. The Piedmont set has no where near the tone or sound quality and the amount of wind required to produce the same volume or note is very noticeable. These can not way match the quality of a better harp and there is simply no way to go back. These are fine for the price, but if you want to play for real, get a quality harp like the Marine Band, even if you're a beginner."
2,"These are Hohner harps, but....","When I first started to learn harp, I saw these and bought them. I figured, Hey, most of all the keys are used are in the case, so that will save me some money. I found out that the harps are cheap plastic ones, made in China. Yes, they have the Hohner name on them, but these are made in China, not Germany. Not everything made in China is bad, but I feel that when you are a beginner on harp, you need to find a good quality harp, like a Hohner Special 20 or a Crossover or mayby a Lee Oskar, in the key of C, then branch out into other keys. A beginner and pro alike needs a good solid quality harp, one that is airtight, and makes bending easier,which these harps do not. All in all, I would not recommend these harps. The only thing that is worth the money is the nice case they come in. Spend your money on one good harp, and if you want to buy these, give them away to kids to play with."
1,Yeah not worth it even for a beginner,"Had to give this set one star just to get the review to post...Actually zero.I picked up this set at Guitar Ceneter, thinking that it was a good deal for the price. I was expecting ""pocket pal"" quality. I have to say that I am not pleased with the set. The C harp leaks and everyone of the harps will have to be tuned and gapped. I would not reccomend this set to even the most novice of players, as you will spend most of your time trying to figure out if it is the Harp or you that doesn't sound good. Get individual Harps and get what you pay for...you definitely will with this set."
1,"Not worth the money or time,Very discouraging","Four of the harps in this set were bad when i received them, don't even buy them for beginners I think it will only frustrate and discourage them from playing. The case is nice but thats about it, spend the money on something better"
3,If it's too good to be true...it's ALL PLASTIC!,"WellIf it's too good to be true...it probably is""what a great deal!"" I thought to myselfWHY DONT YOU JUST TELL us that they are totally 100 percent plastic?Really?....Besides that, they sound decent,But the plastic against your lips just dosen't feel right,Feels like a cheap toy, I guess I better keep them in the case,These feel like they are worth 2 dollars each,An expensive case I guess?Do yourself a favor and save up the money for a real set, that you can pass on to your kids,or at least be proud of.I guess If your dead broke and just need the harp sounds for recording, this set is ok, or.....You could just go to the 99 cents store for something of a similar feel."
3,Not bad,"I have had these harps for a few days, and I already had a hohner pocket pal. I am not much of a harmonica player, but I can play a bit so I bought these to learn. The harps all work just fine and they sound good. Im not crazy about the plastic, but hey it was a cheap set. I would recommend this for a beginner."
3,Beginners Set,Great set for the beginner but if going to get serious about playing Hohner's Bluesband Seven Piece Set for only a few dollars more is a much better set.
1,These harmonicas sound dull,"The price and case is nice, but the plastic casing of each harp leaves them dull sounding compared to my other harmonicas. I thought I'd round out my set with all the other keys, but these harps sound like they are playing underwater with no vibrancy. I guess you get what you pay for. Might be okay for a kids starter set, but if you are serious about playing harmonica, look for better quality than this."
4,What a great value!,My son asked for a harmonica for his birthday. The name I thought of was Hohner and began my search on Amazon. When I found that I could get a set of 7 I scooped it up! My son is just learning but having a harmonica in each key has sparked an interest for him with what different genre's use which keys predominantly. Great starter set!
2,peidmont blues harmonica set,"They were in a neat case.In fact the case is the only thing that was really useable.the harmonica's in the key of c, e, f, g, and bFlat are not useable at all for a complete scale.I would hate to know that someone was using the Hohner name on an item such as what I purchased.I still use a Hohner Marine Band that has been in my posession for the past forty years(40)."
3,Ok for the Money,"I have a full set of Hohner Special 20s, and full set of Johnson Blues Kings. I really don't recommend this set except for newbies to play around with, but a Johnson Blues King set would be better. The Piedmonts are not very air-tight; they leek a lot. I have a Fisher Price child's toy that blows better. I guess you get what you pay for. I bought three sets for people as gifts, for them to play around with. For my set? I'll acquire more Suzuki Bluesmasters and Hohner Special 20s; use this Piedmont case for my travel set and give the individual harmonicas from the Piedmont set to my grandkids. ;) I paid $20 for this set; the case is worth about half that. ;)"
2,Cheap is as cheap does!,"Darn, got the Piedmont Blues set from Hohner...plastic comb..OK...plastic shell..not OK...cheapy reeds...Bad! Thought maybe they sounded bad because of the plastic shell...so switched out with shell from special 20...it fits perfectly but still sounds dull and no volume! Total bumber man! Was hoping to find replacement reeds for my Special 20s but no go. The brass reed plates are obviously not of the same quality or thickness as in the other standard harps Hohner offers. These are perfect for kids just learning and that is it! I will be giving these away."
3,You get what you paid for.,This set is a high quality plastic kid harmonica set . If your a beginner this set will help you understand how different keys work bettor with different songs. At least 2 harmonicas are not going to work. Forget doing any bending. The case is nice and I will be putting some nice harps in it.
4,Hohner Piedmont Blues Harmonica Set,"Extremely good value for the money, as you'd expect from any Hohner product.I play the harmonica hard, and every harp in this set plays the same as the next. Having a harp in each key that - other than the different key itself - plays exactly the same makes transitioning from one to the next very easy. The only problem I found was that the key identifier easily wipes off the harp, forcing me to have the set engraved so I can identify each key correctly.I'd buy this item again in a heartbeat."
1,Pass on this,"The case is nice but the harps are cheap. I was told they are the best. not true in my case they are not that good. They have failed, plus they have a very nasty smell and taste to them that I dont like so I say pay more for a better harp you will be happy that you did, Thanks From Mad Matt Blues"
4,Good value for beginners/casual users,"These are good quality plastic harmonicas in a handy, useful case. All the harmonicas worked. The reeds were soft, (easy to play). They are great for car trips. My daughter and I jammed on them and she ended up taking them home with her. I will probably get another set. They come with a booklet that has a few songs that young people may not know. If you want to explore harmonica music this is the way to go."
5,Awesome Honer set,"When I received this set in the mail, I could not believe the non-existent weight. I have always preferred a harmonica with some weight to it, but you cant even tell they are in your hand. That may sound negative, but after playing them for a while now I have adjusted fine and love this set.If you are an avid player, you will understand when I say that I own at least 3 or 4 harmonicas for every key. Some people don't get it, but if you do understand... this set is an excellent addition to your collection. If you are new to playing or just want to play alone, this is not the set for you. The sound that sings forth from this set is incredible when accompanying other instruments. If you want to play alone, go order one of the Marine Band harmonicas or something similar. You need a full wood body and this set is light weight plastic."
2,Cheap is the key word,"First off I did not buy these on amazon. Rather I purchased from Gutiar Center. The price is right for a beginner or established player looking for a cheap A-G set. However I give it two stars because day 2 into playing the G Harp the 7 hole blow became flat. A couple blows and draws later the metal reed cracked off and ruined the entire harp. Another quark with these harps is that they are very light, due to the cheap plastic casing.My suggestion is purchase only if are a beginner or just looking for an A-G set to practice or dabble with.I prefer the Hohner Marines. Pricey but won't fail you at a gig.Oh and the case is pretty nice. Just buy it for the case and as the harps start keeling over replace with a decent 30 dollar harp."
1,Hohner Piedmont Blues Harmonica Set,I was very unhappy with this product. The reeds took for ever to warm up and got stuck offten! The plates were plastic and very slow was well. it was not an easy slid on the mouth. I would not recommended this to any one. The only good thing about it is the box!
1,Not Worth It!,Most of the harmonicas leak and I find them very hard to play without squeezing them tight! I am just beginning to learn and didn't need this difficulty. All plastic construction doesn't work. You can do better. The case is nice however.
4,Good starting set,"I was very impressed initially at the case and the overall make of these beginner harmonicas. The are pretty bright and tinny sounding, but for the price, its great to get you into harmonicas.Biggest complaint - the painted on key indication rubs off in about an hour.Overall a good buy for beginners looking to get a few different keys of harmonicas."
4,There a good start..,"These harmonicas are great for starting to play like me but they don't have the same sound as metal harps. The ""Black Matte Finish"" is in fact plastic.Don't get me wrong, these are perfect for beginning esp for the price, you can't beat it. I plan on buying another set of all metal ones in the near future when i get a little better at playing."
3,Sounds good but are PLASTIC.,Decent. They sound quite nice but are the shell is made of plastic. You get what you pay for.
3,"Good price, but...","This was my first ""set"" of harps. As stated in other reviews expect one or more not to work (too much escaping air). But what do you expect for the price (and they are plastic). After a month of moderate use three or four have blown out reeds. Maybe I'm playing too hard. Overall not a bad deal!"
4,Harmonica Set,"I bought this set for my husband...It took him a couple of weeks to figure out how to get the best sound from the Harmonica's, but he now enjoys them greatly. A beginner may get a little frustrated, but if you've had any experience in playing the harmonica you should do just fine with this set."
2,nice to look at but not to play,Was very disappointed with this set. Should have known better when I saw the price. I've caught better harmonicas than these at Mardi Gras parades off the floats. Waste of time to play but okay to look at and put on the shelf.
5,Great set and price,ok i bought this set cause ive wanted it ever sence i 15 or 16 im now 18 on my own with my new wife anyway this set is worth what you pay they are made of plastic but there not made cheaply they do have quality to them the only problem i had was the funny taste they leave in ur mouth but i supose that will go away in time besides that perfect for pro or beginner i loved them great job hohner
5,Excellent product,"Excellent value for the money. The set is perfect for beginners and for small gigs. Although the body of the harmonicas is made of plastic, they produce a very nice sound and they are really easy to bend."
1,Not impressed,"The case only fits these harps, they are pretty cheaply made. Bending is difficult, and it will trash these harps. Half of them needing adjusting the reeds to even get a sound. Save your cash, get a Suzuki promaster and be satisfied. All metal, chromed, and sturdy."
5,It presents the way to overcome the trouble of the mind.,"The mind is like a film. If you develop what you have photographed in your mind, it becomes your life. What you imprint on your mind gets played like a movie on a screen called the universe. You yourself become a true actor.When,however, you surrender all the images in your mind, your weary journey also ends. from <Polishing the Diamond, Enlightening the Mind>"
1,the title was misleading,I just wanted to know how to store the food I put up for my family properly. This book is for people who think armageden is just around the corner. I really don't think I need guns to protect my food.
2,"An OK overview of food storage, but the details are lacking.","Although this book was a good overview of a food storage system, it was not as detailed as I would have liked. The author could have elaborated on many of the subjects introduced, but I suppose this would have made the price unattractive to some buyers."
5,My son's favorite - well made,"Title says most of it. My 9 year old son loves this. It's big enough it doesn't get lost but fits under his arm for carrying. Being 9 ... he kind of doesn't carry the stuffed animals around as much as he used to ... but Totoro has soldiered on ... as a passenger in the car ... staring unblinkingly into space. It's well made, not as 'soft' as other toys but soft enough it doesn't irritate little faces, and has withstood 4 months of abuse well."
1,"oh no,another book by maltin","this book is probably just another annoying book with wrong information,like most (or all) of maltin's books."
1,"Leonard, how could you?","I can't believe Leonard Maltin would put his name on this compilation of misinformation. He must be spreading himself too thin and hiring interns to do his writing. This book is so full of wrong dates, films, facts--I hope if he comes out with a second edition, Maltin hires someone to go over it with a fine-toothed comb and make corrections. I expected better of him!"
3,Outdated.,"This book was great when I got it...10 years ago.Although Mr. Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia is enjoyable to read, it is extremely outdated and there needs to be a new edition. For readers looking for some info on their favorite classic movie star, chances are you'll probably find a bio on him/her. But for recent actors, no luck."
5,great,Ordered with Leonard Maltin's movie guide. For my nephew. I figured this would be a good addition for big movie lovers.
4,Nice combination of actors,"Great, funny must see! If not more then once, at least once to laugh your a$$ off."
5,Gridlok'd is 2pac's performance ever,Tupac and Tim Roth light up the screen in this action/comedy.One of Tupac's best performances.
5,Unexpectedly funny,this is dark comedy at its finest... rapper Shakur and Pulp Fiction's Roth are great together... the dialog is very funny. This is definitely worth adding to your collection.
1,Boring,"Tupac did a good job acting (he was the reason I watched this movie), but the movie was too slow for me. The director's choice of flashbacks to me didn't match with the plot."
2,Unfair to be called trashy; but not too far...,"I am jsut wondering why many people take this book as another 'Bible' leveled book. It sounds exactly like an insult to all those real 'Bible' books.Some other reviewers are right: the editting is lousy, the graphs are irresponsible,...., and some other over a thousand flaws. One can expect to learn more by simply browsing Optionetics forum."
2,not worth it,"I guess you get what you paid for. To me it's not worth it. Maybe it's a different story for the more expensive ones. This one covers the speakers that are on the dashboard. They're not cut-out or pre-cut. Don't believe them when they say ""it won't make any difference"" coz' IT DOES. The highs (tweeters) are literally being covered and nowhere for the sound to come out..."
5,It is Wonderful!!!,"THis boot strecher works fantastic! It fits into boots very easily and fast, and streches great, thank you for such a great product!!!"
3,Worked fine after a small modification,"I couldn't get it to stay in the front of the shoe where it needed to be stretched, the more I cranked it, the more it would just slide backwards.I made a simple wooden block with a matching profile to fit the heel of the boot so it was just touching the Boot Stretcher, that way when I started cranking it open, once it jammed itself against the wooden block it opened up nicely and performed to my satisfaction."
5,GREAT tool,Both my boots fit perfectly now.Stretched them both for 48hrs.Now my feet don't ache after 2 hours.Solidly built!
3,boot stretcher,it does ok but I'd like it better if there were more of the inserts and a couple of them were shaped differently
4,Down to the Bone.,"I found this an excellent book in helping me deal with some of the more obscure problems that pop up in my software projects. For anybody truly seeking to write a playable game and not just one that looks and sounds good, then this book can help. It gives information that goes right to the bone, helping to build an intelligent framework that will keep your customers playing and happy - (and comming back for more). On the down side, in some places the writing is a little stilted and the theory requires a good understanding of math. Over all I'd say an excellent resource esp. for the person who is serious in becoming an adept programmer and willing to work and learn to get there."
4,No Dogs Allowed!,"This is a great book! Especially if you like animals! Bill Wallace is a good author. You should read his other books, too!"
4,no dogs allowed,"This is the cutest book I ever read. It's about these dogs. They can't go to the place they want to go because there's a sign that says NO DOGS ALLOWED. It's a sad book, but it's really good. Bill Wallace writes really good books even though they are not true. But that doesn't mean they are not good."
1,Not even worth the money,"I love Sinatra but this is not one of the best CD's to buy especially if it will be the first in your collection. Not the best tracks,I wish I purchased another..."
5,It's 'All the Way' with Ole Blue Eyes!,"Of course, ""Gold"" is only one of many albums (CDs) by Frank Sinatra, but the 12 songs presented is a good selection (and collection). All of the performances are re-releases, naturally, and nothing new is added, but it's pure Sinatra, Sinatra in top form, and a good choice as a ""sample"" of his works.The choices range from ""All the Way"" through ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and concludes with ""Chicago."" This EMI-Capitol Music edition is yet another example of marketing Sinatra perfection. It's nice to be able to get such music amidst the din, the cacophony of much of today's ""entertainment."" (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"
5,Gold (Pair)Audio CD Frank Sinatra,This was shipped by alovesupreme last Fri. received to-day. It is simply great and if you miss out on buying this you will be so sorry. Nice and Easy was one of Sinatra's first records - the tone of this CD is terrific - am going back for more.
2,DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS CALCULATOR,"I bought this calculator in February, 2010 and when it suddenly decided not to work 4 months later I thought ""what a disappointment""! But then I noticed the reset button on the back. When I reset the calculator it worked just fine! So now I take back all my ugly thoughts about Canon's product and have my trust restored! LOL The price is affordable and I do expect to get my money's worth and more. Just remember the reset button on the back if you have a problem. UPDATE: 2/2/2011 iT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE I BOUGHT THIS CALCULATOR AND IT'S BEEN DEAD ABOUT 2-3 MONTHS NOW! SO IF YOUR ARE LOOKING FOR A CALCULATOR THAT WILL GIVE YOU MAYBE 10 MONTHS OF SERVICE ABOUT 9 OR 10 MONTHS USING THE RESET ON THE BACK....THEN THIS IS THE CALCULATOR FOR YOU! AS FOR ME....I'M GOING TO GO WITH ANOTHER PRODUCT.....I THOUGHT CANON WOULD BE A GOOD BRAND....MY MISTAKE FOR SURE!"
1,JUNK! - LOOK ELSEWHERE,"What a piece of crap. Just about a year and it is DEAD - as a doornail!!Won't start, or do anything. I have had other calcs that are FAR SUPERIOR to this PIECE OF CRAP!!Look at Texas Instruments, anywhere but Canon!"
2,not that great,"I was looking to replace another calculator that is solar powered but I've used it so long that the numbers have rubbed off. But this one is not what I was looking for, just the feel of it is not what I wanted. But for a basic calculator it will work fine for you."
3,exercise cd,"It's a good selection of songs, but mostly an 'exercise tape'. The sound quality's good, but all tracks run together (no breaks) and the tempo of some tracks (specifically Send Me an Angel) is speeded up to match some desired pace.Unfortunately, I was looking more for of a set of studio tracks on the CD."
3,Theoretical rather than practical,"The book loses one star because it's primarily a presentation of algorithms that are theoretically interesting, rather than algorithms that are good to use. I doubt very much that the authors have any real software engineering experience.It loses another star because the writing style is so awkward and painful to read. The authors don't appear to be native speakers of English, and it shows. The text really needs to be cleaned up by an editor familar with idiomatic English.Bottom line: If you actually need to implement a string search, look elsewhere for guidance..."
3,Himmler's Cavalry,"This is the story of a much ignored SS organization that was found not guilty at the Nuremberg Trials. Dr. Wilson disagrees with that finding and presents a pretty good case to back up his opinion. The writing itself is very good and well organized. It is a welcome addition to the literature on Nazism. Problems with the book include its' name index which lists the names in alphabetical order by last name, but prints the names starting with the first name. Normally the publisher, Schiffer, omits indexes altogether, so maybe they are trying to learn how to do it. A more inclusive index would be of greater help to scholars since this is a scholarly work. The only other fault I found was the very meager bibliography. Secondary sources were generally older works, and primary source materials were mostly German records, none of which were translated or included in the text. Otherwise, a good read."
5,Cute story,"This is an awesome story about a boy who can't seem to do anything right. He shows off his chopstick/eating talent with his preschool class. The pictures show people of diverse backgrounds, and the story is endearing."
5,country christmas,I was very pleased with my purchase. The company sent the wrong CD first and one little email and the correct CD was on the way very speedy and very helpful in fixing the mixup. I could not ask for better customer service. I would shop with them again.M Martin
5,Intimate before thousands of people,"This CD is part two of a single concert held over two nights in January 2000 at the Philippine International Convention Center. This part is about 40 minutes long, and includes the long Streisand medley. Her short personal comments reflect the intimacy she creates with her live audiences. The orchestra is conducted by, and with arrangements of her brother Gerard Salonga. And of course, it has the wonderful interpretations in her song."
5,Converting vinyl LPs to CDs,Easy to use and does everything I expected. I have LPs dating to the 50s and I have already converted about 30 to CDs. In some cases I was able to get two LPs on one CD which is great for my two LP albums (total CD space is 80 minutes).
4,RecordNow 9,I purchased this for my husband. He had a really old version of it when his computer broke. He bugged me for months to find it so i went online and there it was. Thanks Again.
5,A great book that captures a image of the equine species.,I once looked at this book and fell in love with the pictures. Robert Vavra can really capture the true energy of the horse. I love horses and I have never seen such such beautiful pictures in my life.
5,Absolutely stunning!,The book really captured my eye at a bookstore. It's really amazing on what the artist can really do.
5,Beauty,Agreat book I will never tire of. The positions and poses of the horses put one a fairy tale world.
5,Horses of the Sun: Robert Vavra,This is a must have for horse lovers. The photos are outstanding. The text is also worth the purchase.
1,please don't buy this book,"when i published this edition of ""releasing"" back in 1997, it was a must-have for indie bands releasing their own music. because so much has changed in the past five years, this book is now totally out-of-date and out-of-print. please do not buy a used copy of this book! the book is mostly contact info for various independent music-related companies, and all of this info is outdated. the web does a much better job at providing this sort of information, so start searching. good luck! -gary hustwit"
1,This book is a farce. Pages of lists and little content.,This book is a farce. It is full of pages and pages of lists that are outdated and incomplete. There is some SPARCE writing in the book that seems to serve the purpose of filling the space between the lists. It is of no help whatever for someone trying to learn how to start a record company. It is clear that the author has no understanding of this business beyond the knowledge that an average Joe band player has .
5,Artistry,"The sound quality is nothing like what we are used to today, even with over-compressed CDs. But the artistry of the musicians is marvelous."
2,Too small in the with,"My feet are an 8 1/2 wide, these boots are made in China and the with is smaller than any other boots I have ever ordered. The next time I will do alittle more digging before I buy."
2,Gift,"the boots were ok. nice looking, with the seems sturdy and well made. at least for the one I was given. the only problem that I had was the fit. I ordered extra wide but the extra wide was more for a regular fit. so I was very upset. I would recommend that anyone do more research and not get persueded on price."
5,lil wayne the son of birdman.,"lil wayne the son of birdman. Just like his dad. Lil wayne is one of the best rappers still in cash money.hits likes Lights Off,Young Playa and Drop It Like It's Hot. I would it a 5 out of 5."
2,TOTALLY DISSAPIONTED!,"OVERALL THIS IS WACK.WORST CMR. DISC EVER. ONLY SONGS LISTENABLE ARE 2,11,13,AND 16. DONT BUY THIS CD."
1,This aint worth it,"Man this cd aint worth yo 14 dollas people. This cd was supposed to go hard, but this is the worst Ca$h Money cd yet. Lil Wayne was tight on everybody elses cd's except on his. This cd aint worth ya'lls money. The only tight songs on here, Tha Block Is Hot and Keisha. That is all. Peace out."
3,Tha Block is Hot,"Look, this C.D. ain't off the hook or notin, but [it] didn't just drop. i know a lot of people who bought it. all the song's ain't phat but he can flow, he movin up in cash money, i like the c.d. but it could have had a little more work. ya'll need to quit hatin'"
4,...,"After searching around for this items on the web i found it here so i ordered as a gift for a buddy of mine, he loved it."
5,Best Cash Money record out there,"This is one of the best CDs around. If you are a true Cash Money fan, you should have this record. There are no bad songs on the album, and Mannie Fresh is droppin the beats, so you know it's gonna be tight. I was gonna throw down all the good tracks, but theyre all good, so look at the playlist."
3,"Wayne's got good lyrics, but beats need work.....","I'd Give this 3&1/2 stars. The lyrics are good, andamazingly, Wayne doesn't really use a lot of profanity...hopefully anew trend in hip-hop. The Block is hot (song, not title of the cd) is the tightest track of the year! Some of the other tracks could have been hot, but the beats drag them down... Wayne is just so full of potential (as heard on the stellar hot boys cd, guerilla warfare, and i can't wait for his second cd, whenever it comes out...hopefully a.s.a.p."
3,iz aight ok,"this album could of had more work done 2 it.iz only like 2 or the tight songs:the block iz hot,remember me thas it"
5,"Passes other Cash Money Efforts, lands Lil Wayne a classic",What can I say you really would not suspect somebody with the name Lil Wayne to have deep Music that is not commurciel and comes from heart.
2,IZ LIL WAYNE'S BLOCK COLD?,"I've been waiting for Lil Wayne 2 drop his solo album 4 a while now, but I see it wasn't worth waiting 4. Its not hype as I thought it was gonna be. I think he should have took more time on it. But I'm looking forward to Juvenile's G-Code and the Hot Boys' Let em burn. I hope they shyt be servin'."
4,THA BLOCK IS TRULY HOTT!,"i love tha cash money brothers and all but i think they could have did a better job on lil wayne's album. i like tha album but some of tha beats on tha songs just don't go with tha cash money brothers. but my favorite songs are: tha ""intro"", ""tha block is hot"", ""loud pipes"", Watcha wanna do"", ""kisha"", ""lights off"", ""remember me"", ""drop it like it's hot"", ""young playa"", ""enemy turf"" and ""up to me"". but i still love cash money and think they are tha bomb. they don't only rap good they look good too!"
5,Tha Block Is Hot!,"Lil Wayne is the man. I have heard mixed emotions about this CD but in my opinion it is the best ""rap"" CD I have bought in a while. ""It's gravy baby!"""
5,Da Next Pac,Beware of lil weezie. Da boy has lyrics for days. Da hatas need to step cuz this playa has what it takes to become a living legend. Comes harder than big brotha in some of the songs. Classic in the making. peace
5,IF YOU DONT THINK IT'S OF DA CHAIN THEN U HAVEN'T HEARD IT!,"first i wanna let the person that said there was only about six songs worth listening to know that 6 out of 17 is pretty dam good...but 6 isnt enough this album has 6 songs that are completely off the chain and the rest are phat...the best songs are ""Da Block is Hot"", ""Loud Pipes"", ""Kisha"", ""Respect Us"", ""Young Playa"", ""Enemy Turf"", and track 16...those 7 songs torch most of the CDs that have come out this year...make sure u listen to the whole track on ""Kisha"" because at first i didn't like it but then i heard Juvenile rip it to shreds...unless u hate rap music or are in the KKK then this is a must buy...ONE"
5,He's back,This is one of my favorite albums of all time. But I just heard the new Lil Shine album - Money is my Motivation. Listening to Lil Shine in album reminded me of the days when I first heard lil wayne. You should check out the CD .....now before it's too late!
2,Tha Block Is A Cold Fish,"n---- THIS d--- block is da cold phishy wishy washy n----z dat a n---- dont -- -- ---- wit any more, ya heard, and if u want a cold cd dis m---f----z focshu ye heard me once, ya heard me twice, ya heard me chicken soup wit da m---f--n ryce.DONT HATE ME I JUZ NEED DA -- -- ----!"
4,Lil Wayzie is off the Hook,"Yo, I dig this album cuz Juvey, B.G., and Young Turk are on it. Laced with beats by Manny Fresh and tight lyrics from Em Hot Boys. You don't have a choice but to ""Respect Their Minds"" This album is for all down south hustlaz. Bump this shhh in your trunks with the 10s and 15s in the trunk. You gotta Love It"
1,I agree wit Paul,This album is weak. It has a few decent cuts but most of the songs suck. Mannie Fresh is burnt out now. All of his beats sound the same and they have no pound in the car at all. Don't get Juvenille's new album either its worst than this.
1,LMAO LOOK AT THE COVER ART!,This CD is garbage! To hell with Lil Wayne. That monkey deserves to be beaten to death by real rappers.
2,"""It's Bonk"" ya dig","I feel that they could have done better than what they done to lil Wayne cd cuz it's bonk as hell I'm glad I heard it before I go waste some money on this sh!t! the beats were str-8 garbage! I couldn't believe that Mannie Fresh produced this kind of garbage but it happen sometime. And all who said that this sh!t is tight, you to stop lying to yourself and plus get cha mind right cuz ya boy P and The army is bacc I'm just wait for ya boy Mystikal come out and show these boys who they are deal wit again and shut them down again so I'll holla ! So keep it real C.M.B and everybody"
1,Boring,"This CD is as dull as dull gets. Amazon told me Lil Wayne demanded that he didn't want anyone to hear songs other than ""Block is Hot"" on this site. He knew this mess wouldn't sale if we heard it before we bought it. If you don't believe this CD is weak, ask yourself this: ""Do I ever hear anybody playing Lil Wayne in the car with the bass so high the trunk rattles?"" ""Do I ever play Lil Wayne in the car with the Bass so high people can hear it?"" Answer: No and hell no! You're too embarrassed to play something so ugly to the ears so stop fronting like you like this CD and stop supporting junk. Criss Cross were younger and more talented. And they didn't have to use curse words to look tough! Lil wayne is a foul mouthed brat who stole Manny Fresh's incomplete beats and made a CD before Cash Money knew about it. Whew!"
5,Let's Take It Back To The Ol' Lil' Wayne,"Yo Lil' Wayne is the best out of Cash Money Records just to let y'all know and this CD is a straight up. Cash Money classic from Weezy F Baby. The Block Is Hot is a sweet CD, there's a lot of good songs on here. Cop it."
3,Uhhh! The Block is Not So Hot!,"Sorry to all of you Lil Wayne fans, this is the lowest review I have given out of all of my reviews. Lil Wayne just does not get the job done. He is way better in his appearences in other songs and the Hot Boy$. The best songs on this Cd are 2,4 and heck? I'm stumped! All of you fans will get mad at me for writing this review, but sorry he just doesn't cut it on this album. Sorry! I'm a really big fan of Cash Money, I have everyone of their Cd's, but this one just is not really that good. Instead of buying this I would tell you to buy B.G. or Juvenile. Sorry all of Wayne's Fans!"
1,What a waste of money,"#2 block is hot,#8 F**k the world and #17 You Want War are the only tight tracks in this album. CASHmoney needs more YoungTurk on the album of cmr. IF you buy this cd i promise u that it is wack..."
4,Its tight enough,Its cool and lil wayne could really bust a flow in loud pipes and drop it like its hot The beats were alright and the songs with most bass were Tha Block is Hot and Not Like Us
1,1 star because there was no 0 stars to choose,"this cd is horrible. only one good song ""tha block is hot"" the rest are horrible. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you feel it nessisary to have all CMR records. this cd is a jjoke."
3,3 Stars,"Tha Block Is Hot was released during the explosion of Cash Money and made Lil Wayne one of the big stars of Cash Money, but album is still AVERAGE."
5,I feel Lil Wayne is a block burner,This c.d. is tight it is one of the best cash money c.d.s ever. Lil Weezie shows he truly is a block burner with this c.d. I have been a Cash money fan since the beginning go pick up this c.d you wont regret it
3,THA BLOCK IS WARM NOT HOT,"Don't get me wrong Lil Wayne is off the hook, but only bout 5 to 6 songs are worth listening to on the cd. Even though if I had heard the cd before I bought it I would have still bought it just cuze its Lil Wayne. Tha Block is Hot is the best song on there, its off the hook that's why it get s 3 star"
5,Lil'Wayne,"THE TALENTED 17 YEAR OLD ARTIST WHO IS KNOWN AS LIL'WAYNE OR WIZEY WHO MIGHT I ADD IS SO VERY FINE AND TALENTED HE IS NOW ON HIS SECOND SOLO RECORD WHICH WILL ALSO BE AS SUCSESSFUL AS HIS FIRST AS GO ON WITH HIS PROJECT INCLUDING HIS CASH MONEY BROTHERS JUVINEL,B.G., TURK,BABY, AND MANNIE FRESH HELPING HIM OUT AND HAVING HISBACK THEY WILL ALWAYS BE SUCSESSFUL AND REACH FOR THE STARS.BY THE ONE AND ONLY :PRINCESS DOMINIQUE RAGLANDB.K.A BABY NIQUE"
3,lil wayne,"lil wayne is probably the best out of all of cash money. considering his lyrics/songs arent 100% about ice, jewelery, cars, money, girls....but then he aint tha best lyricist. i admit i gotta give mannie fresh some credit for comin up w/ the sickass beats but other than that, hopefully, lil wayne's next album will improve (especially in lyrics)...that prolly goes for tha rest of cash money too. they aint concentrating on the lyrics as much. i'm gettin sick and tired of hearing tha same materialistic stuff. not to mention tha fake thuggin.. i'm not saying that cmr are fake thugs, they just gotta lighten up on tha lyrics. my 2 cents."
1,"Trite, Boring, Painful","As an avid reader of westerns, I picked up this book because it was by a local author, and I thought it would be interesting to experience the west through a new type of hero that has not been explored much, the African American cowboy. But this book was painfully trite and boring. The main character is nothing more than a caricature, and completely full of himself. Not wanting to judge too quickly, I read another book by the same author following the same caricuture, er character.The author can't even keep his own characters straight. In a previous book the main character Jay, was half African American, half Apache. In this book, he's half white and half African American. Please don't waste your time on this book, stick to the classic westerns like the Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy."
1,A real snore,"Don't bother with this book. It's really, really, really bad. It's not written well at all and it's like reading the dictionary."
4,Comfortable and elegant,"Very nice shoe, right size and very comfortable. The strap is nice and the big buckle gives an interesting touch."
2,AP Chem,"This was an ok book for me but it didn't seem like the real test. I received better test prep stuff from my AP Chem teacher. I would recommend this book if you had some serious learning to do before the test, not just as a study guide."
2,Not Necessary,"I purchased this book to help me prepare for the AP Chemistry exam and my class final, but when I started to read it, I put it aside and never opened it again because it was too simplistic. You're already going to know the stuff that they're telling you; the stuff that you need to know is the information that they leave out. You're much better off just sticking to your class notes. That's how I got a five."
1,Grandoise claims,"The title is a bit misleading; this book represents Marx's efforts to put Calculus on a sound, rigorus footing.As a mathematician, I have to say that Marx succeeds only in moving the handwaving from one area to another.If the author was not a mathematician, he should have made an attempt to familarize himself with the actual rigorization of Calculus in the nineteenth century (in, for example, the work of Cauchy). If the author was a mathematician, he most certainly should have known better.I cannot recommend this book to anyone who does not have a solid understanding of mathematics."
1,This is the graphic novel of dieting fiction,"I was expecting a touching story of a woman addicted to food. Instead it was sensational, repetitive, poorly written, and really not any more interesting than having your friend tell you everything she ate today and everything she's going to eat tomorrow when she starts a new fad diet.I would recommend buying The Dieter by Susan Sussman instead of this book."
1,disappointing read,I expected this book to be stories of different women and their troubles with weight. It was the story of one woman and once we heard about her life the rest of the book just described the diet she decided to use. Really not what I expected and quite boring.
1,One of the worst books ever written!!,"I knew this book was a work of fiction by a diet book author, but I thought it might be inspiring for someone that is always looking for motivation. Instead I got antiquated soap opera type problems of unbelievable proportions for this woman. (Ex: I can't possibly have a career AND a baby!) Her end ""result"" the ""diet"" is ridiculous, expensive and puts her first in line for a heart attack. I guess being ""skinny"" is all that matters in the end. Ridiculous book. I am not even going to mention the editing...which is a travesty!"
5,An Inspiring Story...I Recommend The Diet,"The Diet by Edita Kaye is an inspiring story of one woman's struggle with her self and her weight. She goes into a dark and difficult life experience that is much bigger than weight gain and finally emerges, through faith, perserverance and a miracle as a new woman. I recommend The Diet to everyone who wants to find hope in her journey to weight loss. God bless Cate and God bless Edita."
1,wish i'd read the reviews here first!,"i just downloaded antispam to my new laptop and a formerly perfect machine now has intermittent internet access and is just plain acting funny when I go online. I just contacted support via email, but I have little hope. I'm going to try for a refund."
1,Little added value,"In regard to blocking spam emails, I have not found much in this product that is not available for free with Outlook Express filtering.The popup blocker would be OK if it didn't block good as well as bad popups.All in all this program creates more trouble than it prevents.Not worth the price."
1,If only I had read these reviews first!,"Ditto, ditto. I bought it OTC at Costco, and find that it habitually moves mail on my allowed list to the spam folder. At least it gives me an easy way to id all new messages, read the two that are legit, and delete the 9 spams. I basically read my mail from the spam folder now!"
1,Garbage,"As a user of this and other Norton products and as a tech-support professional, I must tell you that the bad reviews are true. I used to be a big fan of Norton products until recently."
1,Rubbish software,"It works intermittently - beware opening your email too soon after reboot as it seems AntiSpam takes a while to connect up with Outlook. Don't use the ""This is spam"" or ""This is not spam"" as this usually hangs Outlook requiring a reboot. The entry under ""Outlook or Outlook Express fails after clicking the ""This is Spam"" button in your email program"" on the Symantec web site doesn't exist so I guess they know there's a bug but can't figure out how to fix it."
2,A Mixed Bag,"The GOODIt does effectively filter SPAM. In my experience over the last 7 months, it has been 92% effective. This is great because 63% of my email is SPAM. Let's me focus on my work.The BADIt is really really slow. If you click the ""This is SPAM button"" it takes about 6 seconds to process the request. More disturbing is that other operations like selecting different emails are also slower.The UGLYAs other users have indicated, don't open up your email (Outlook Express in my case) too soon after reboot or AntiSPAM will not load. Very strange. Wait until you hard drive starts buzzing before you open the email application.In the past, I also experienced crashes when hitting the ""This is SPAM button"". Strangely, I have not had this happen lately.If your SPAM level is only about 10%, don't bother with this program. If your SPAM level is 50% or higher, this might be worth a try."
1,Very Unsatisfactory results?,"I found this software to be VERY dissapointing. It just does not work very well? I use Incredimail as my e-mail provider, and find Norton AntiSpam to be less than helpful. It is very good at always mentioning Norton AntiSpam on my spam e-mails, problem is it doesn't block most of them? So what is the use of having an AntiSpam program? I find this product to be a total waste of money. Now I am really wondering about the quality of other Symantec Norton products in general?"
1,Non functional,"Nine out of 10 tries to open Outlook Express have failed since I first installed this product. I suppose that's one way of stopping spam; you don't get any email at all. Symantec's free online technical support has tried to help, but the apex of the advice has been to redownload and reinstall the suite--32 MB of data and then 32 MB of Live Update. Like other reviewers, I suspect that this product should not have shipped.Purchase with extreme caution and fully back up your system before you install so that you can fully back out."
1,Avoid this product,"My ""This is spam button"" intermittently appears, and NORTON CUSTOMER SERVICE or TECH SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTENT. I have run the maze to find a way to ask them about the intermittent toolbar and NO REPLY. Symantec would rather you DIY with FAQs dealing with a limited set of issues instead of REAL OPERATIONAL CONCERNS. I've had internet connection issues, lost IE links (recovered them); I use Firefox, had numerous issues. LOTS of PROBLEMS - but mostly disappointing was the LACK OF SUPPORT. If you get this, you're on your own to deal with lots of problems and erratic behavior."
1,"Doesn't activate, customer support worse than useless","Skip this one, and reconsider whether any of the symantec products are worth the hassles."
1,This Must be a JOKE!,"Norton can't be serious. This is truly the worst piece of software ever perpetrated upon mankind.The most incredibly obvious pieces of spam are coming into my inbox by the hundreds, marked ""Norton Anti Spam"", even with my settings on the highest possible sensitivity.The first and only piece of mail they marked as Spam was of course from a desired sender.This is so bad I am amazed.I only wish there was a rated lower than one. This is definitely in the sub zero regions."
5,Great family devotions book!,"Josh McDowell has done it again! This is the second devotions book we have done with our kids. They are teens and need to see how God's Word is relevant to them. This book does just that. In about 7 minutes a day, there are Scriptures to read, a story or devotional thought, then thought provoking questions, and even a sample prayer. I recommend this book for any parent to use with his/her teen. It can also be used by a teen to do personal devotions, and to be honest, it has also challenged me as an adult. If you're looking for a book that will challenge you to live more for the Lord Jesus, this book is for you."
2,very dumbed down and silly,"We stuck with this for about 2 months because of all the positive reviews, but there were too many devotionals that were just plain dumb. They assume a low level of maturity for youth. The ideas and topics were on target but the level of delivery was immature and silly."
5,Great book for teenagers,Bought this a Christmas gift for teenage granddaughter. I feel good about giving a book by this author.
5,Great!,"This was for my 15 yr old granddaughter. Here is her comment...""I love how it's something quick and easy to read every morning or whenever you have even 5 minutes. It's directly to the point and teaches you a new lesson each day. It has really made me realize how good I have it...What I love about this book is that it doesn't preach and tell you what you should and shouldn't do, but suggests things to think about throughout your day and the point it's trying to make, not enforce..."""
5,Great teen devotional,Great opportunity for you and your teens to talk and discuss issues relating to them from God's point of view.
5,Wow!,"Gordon takes me back...I remember the smell of wet wool,hot coffee, n gunpowder and the sound of ducks off the water and the colorful characters were all there too...ahhh"
4,Keeps you going,I teach an Advance Cardio Karate Class and this really spiced things up. I have gotten good reviews on the energy and how quickly the class went past. Some of the songs are too disco for me but the others make up for it. It brings back good memories. The inside cover lets you know how long the song is and how many beats per minute.
2,Horrible Music,"BMP to fast for ellipitcal or treadmill. Music was of poor selection. I wasn't moving and grooving. But, it does keep you instep."
3,Funny and true to life,"This was a good book.Its true that two people being different doesn't mean that they can't be friends.The perfect example is of Stacy and Jenelle.They are complete opposites of each other,yet the best of friends.Their differences become more obvious as they grow up but in this difficult process of growing up both of them learn a very important lesson about friendship - and about themselves"
5,I still love this album,"Gosh - I cannoit tell you how often we played this one when it first came out. Every single song is clearly etched in my mind. I love this album. I even remember watching Tina at the MTV and Grammy awards that year. Well deserving of all the praise, this is a classic. Extended remix of I Can't Stand the Rain = Flawless."
4,"almost perfect--except for the 12"" EDIT of Better Be Good To Me","I was thrilled when this reissue was released with the 12"" version of the hits. The 12"" of What's Love Got To Do With It is fantastic, with that unique, special intro--I always thought that maybe the song was actually recorded this way and then edited down for the LP release, because this isn't just an 'extended' version looping specific parts of the song like 12"" versions did at that time, but actually original material added to the original version.My only gripe is the fact that the 12"" version of Better Be Good to Me, running just over 7 minutes, has edited about 30-40 seconds off the original 12"" version!!! As of this writing, this 12"" mix has never appeared on CD in its full running time!It would be great if Tina's two 80s follow-up LPs would also be reissued on CD with all the 12"" versions as bonus tracks."
4,"Giving it 4 stars because it's a classic,but some of the tracks sound dated!","Tina Turner is a classic. Let's not play, alot of people know her music and her image. Her story of what's love got to do with it is pretty good, and is really sad. As for some of the tracks some a excellent while others suck. 1984, way way too outdated. I mean it really is,it's almost kind of boring if you ask me. What's love got to do with it is a classic. it's got a great message and a cool image even by today's standards. I love Private Dancer favorite solo tina song. She really gives you chills about the horrors of prostuiton and the video is even more powerful. She's truly a classic and while i wouldn't put her as the queen(there are certnaily others). Tina doesn't disappoint."
4,Great,This album is the best of her career. In terms of material and performance. Bright and original. A testament to Ms Turner's talent as a performer.Uni
5,Tina Turner Private dancer!,"I love this Tina Turner classic! The self titled song Private dancer is a sensual song, What's love got to do with it was a top hit for Tina Turner and still sounds great after all these years,I cant stand the rain is a classic that sounds great with Tina singing it, Show some respect is great song, along with her cover of the Al Green hit song Let stay together. I love 1984, better be good to me, I wrote a letter, When I was young, and just all of the songs are GREAT~ If you are a Tina Turner fan than this is a must have for your collection! Its money well spent. There are uptempo, mid temp, and even slow songs... all hot in true Tina Turner fashion!"
5,Timeless,"I purchased this item because it was said to be one of her best. The people sure knew what they were talking about! This album provides smooth Tina pefection all the way. From the upbeat great grooves of ""I Might Have Been Queen"" and ""Steel Claw"" to the sexy title track ""Private Dancer"" to the classics ""Whats Love Got to Do with It?"" and ""Better Be Good to Me"" this album is rocking! It's nice to have the extra tracks and extended version (even though they really aren't THAT much longer) they're a nice touch. All in all, Tina fans will love it, people looking for some 'good time' music will appreciate it, and anyone looking for some 80's fun will have stuck gold. This is a timeless great album."
4,She lived it,"Tina Turner beat the odds with PRIVATE DANCER. Radio stations and music journalists tend to give older artists half an ear at best. Thus, superb works like the Everly Brothers' BORN YESTERDAY, Lou Reed's MAGIC AND LOSS and Ringo Starr's TIME TAKES TIME, to name three stand-outs from the over-40 bunch, bounced from the bottom of the charts to the cutout bin. Fortunately for the public, PRIVATE DANCER got deserved airplay and ink, and the R&B singer had perhaps the greatest success of her career. As was the case with the other works I mentioned, PRIVATE DANCER offered songs about life experience, and who has lived more than Tina Turner?! Whether the commands are ""Show Some Respect,"" ""Better Be Good To Me,"" or ""Help,"" it's more than just words (and music) on paper she's following. Get PRIVATE DANCER, songs about life from someone who lived it."
2,Tina is great but not this time.,I like Tina Turner but this CD is not one of her best. Several of her numbers may have been exciting live but they do not translate to audio.
1,Don't Buy!,"This isn't worth the amazingly low price, unless you want to impress with a gift someone you will never see again. This recording is noisy and very low fidelity, with very distracting microphone placement and an amazing level of audience and stage noise frequently obscuring the performance. Stay away from this one."
4,Karajan's La Traviata - interesting and disputable,Is it an italian traviata? No. Is it La Traviata? Maybe.Karajan made peculiar performance similar to engraving. Beauty and delicacy combine with distance and chill - involving and disputable blend. I think it's interesting but not for everyone.
2,"Sounds like it's in a deep, deep hole...","The tonal quality of this particular recording is fairly bad. It isn't the worst that I've heard (that dubious honour goes to one with a person coughing repeatedly next to the microphone), but it sounds rather hollow, almost as though the sound is being piped through a long tube. If having the Karajan ""Traviata"" is your goal, Anna Moffo's voice is spectacular, and Karajan's direction is expert (as expected)...and the price is certainly reasonable.In sum, if you're looking for a copy of Karajan's ""Traviata"", this is it...if you're just looking for a copy of ""Traviata"", you might think to sidestep this one in favour of something with better sound quality."
2,Typical post-it. Color on the website is misleading. :(,"I looked for the bright yellow post-it papers for my little art project. Bought a bright yellow pack from an art store and I really liked it. Then I found this one on Amazon. The canary color description and the picture here are deceiving. Looks much brighter here which is closer to the one I bought in store. I was disappointed when I got the package. They're just your typical pale yellow post-it papers at the office. If you just look for that, it's fine...just know it's not the bright canary color as the picture shows."
4,Well-Written and a Good Read,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
4,Quite a book,Buy for some of my friend. He said the paper quality is not good enough. Maybe the publisher can take into consideration tomake a new version with good quality paper.
4,"Excellent guidance, especially for young writers","One of the worst problems you'll find in the work of young or inexperienced writers is overwriting. Take a look at essays by college students--they're usually redundant with adjectives, adverbs, and breathless description. Young people tend to think this makes their work more engaging. And, sadly, they're typically trying to inflate their ideas to meet a minimum page count.Zinsser provides sober guidance away from these mistakes. Clarity and concision are his watchwords. Although this book is intended for nonfiction writers, I think most fiction writers could benefit from it, too. First novels often suffer from excess description and effusive verbosity. Fiction offers more leeway than nonfiction for using an idiosyncratic style, but Zinsser's approach would still be effective for a novelist: Focus on the essentials, find the humanity, say what you mean."
4,A concise guide of how to write,"This book is well written for all levels of writers. It is well organized in its best possible concise fashion. After reading it, one captures a reasonable ability to write to deliver a clear, simplified style with improved grammatical accuracy and welcome clarity. Therefore, I have recommended all individuals who wish to polish their writing skills to read it in detail."
4,Actually helps,"It seems a little ironic to read a book about writing a book, but it was actually helpful and insightful. Although I only read the parts of the book I felt pertained to my writing, it was interesting to read his spins (which are sometimes things you may have sub-consciously knew were right, but didn't know exactly why).The book did not get the full 5 stars because at the end of the day, it's not at all the greatest writing book I have ever read. A text book might be more helpful, as it is more to-the-point, whereas this book is written more novel-like."
3,Good for a liberal arts major,"Zinsser's book is a good review of basic writing but lacks specifics for anything technical. Zinsser should have written two chapters on science writing--one as a novice and one from the vantage point of the obscure scientist. For the low price, it's difficult to complain too much about this book."
5,"If you write anything, get this book!","This book is a MUST HAVE for anybody that writes anything. I've purchased it a few times because I end up giving it away to friends. It's easy to read, funny and quite practical. When I first read it it changed my perspective on the whole world of writing. It should be required reading, for writing ;-)"
5,"Excellent, a Must-have for any writer","Get this, it is worth every penny. I have over half a dozen books on improving writing style, and this is one of the two best. I am a college professor, and this book is helping me write in a concise, and readable manner. It has great examples and insight from a true expert.There is one finicky chapter on word usage which is a waste of time, but the rest of the book is invaluable."
3,"A mediocre writer, with an arrogance problem","So here's the problem. Brilliant writers don't write books on how to write. Which means you end up getting advice on how to be a good writer from writers who aren't very good. This would be OK if they had some humility, but Zinsser doesn't. He writes as if his work is better than yours could ever be, and therefor deserving of your total fascination. Unfortunately, it's not -- in his section on improving sentences I saw a dozen ways his sentences could be improved. If you really need help writing, I'm sure the book will be useful. I just wish the author dropped the arrogance."
2,Overrated,I don't know why this book is so well regarded. I'm in the middle of reading it for the second time and I am coming away with the same impressions that I did the first time: charming but unhelpful to writers.Zinsser has some good writing advice at the beginning but it quickly ends and becomes a book about commentary on writing rather than instruction.He also introduces his political beliefs heavy handedly.
4,It's ok....it's mostly common sense,"If you buy this book, look at the table content first. Then read what you need and want to learn. Skip the chapters that don't apply to you or interest you. Trust me, it's almost a waste of my time to read how to write well as a travel writer. Learn the principles, learn the methods, and know to give your writing an attitude. Tear up the rest.Here's a summary of what I learned from this book:Use simple language.Write short sentences and paragraphs.Know your audience.Cut the clutter. Be concise.Watch out for unnecessary adjectives and nouns.Write in attitude.Tell a story.Draft then rewrite, rewrite, and rewrite.The ""unity"" and ""the lead and the ending"" chapters are quite interesting."
5,A Gem!!!-Book assigned by a college professor Fall 2009,"The author does a brilliant job walking the reader through a series of writing techniques and methods. Nothing is missed as he discusses the various genres Sports, Humor, Science and Technology, Memoirs, interviews, nonfiction, and more.I appreciated the chapter on Unity, The Sound of Your Voice, The Tyranny of the Final Product, and Write as Well as You Can."
5,Why didn't they make this required reading at UT Austin?,"OK. So, I have a degree in English and write for a living. Once again, I experience humility and just when I wanted to feel like I'd accomplished something as an author.If you plan a career as a writer (and why not) you'll want this book on the right side of your desk. I can't imagine writing without it.Now for the ""The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction"" - I disagree. Creative writers, do your first draft with every drop of passion you can muster. Then come back and do your copy editing. Use your head in your next draft and use Zinsser's book as your guide. Make your novel, short story and screen play roll and smooth out. This material will help make your material - ""a good read""."
4,Great Resource,"I told a writer friend of mine that I wanted to make writing my career. Her advice was that I needed to immediately buy this book. It's nearly the best career advice I've ever received.This book made me a better writer. It's a beginning writer's course in 300 pages--stuffed with invaluable advice, rules of grammar, humor and readability. I enjoyed reading it--how often does that happen with text books? The book encouraged me to write, made me aware of my shortcomings as a new writer, and taught me that ""writing is not fun--having written is.""If you're a new writer, or an experienced one, buy this book."
5,"Next To Strunk and White, This is A Writer's Bible","After digesting approximately 30 books on writing, On Writing Well is tied with my favorite writing resource--but it's unfortunate that I didn't figure that out until recently.My major regret is that I wish I had read this marvelous work more than a decade ago--long before attending five writer's groups; reading more than two dozen other works on writing; and, struggling with a manuscript that, I thought, was almost print ready. Following years of research and many rewrites, my inner Mr. Anal is now pressuring me to painstakingly retrace my own work--hopefully, the last time--and ensure that I have adhered to 'all' of Zinsser's recommendations.On a bitter-sweet note, from one aspiring writer to a legend, William, I 'hate' you!"
3,"Good price, bad quality","It was a great price for the book, but it was written in and in bad condition."
5,A CLASSIC WRITING PRIMER,"""On Writing Well"" is a classic primer on good writing. William Zinsser cuts through the need of many writers to junk up their prose with needless gobbledygook. I wish I had read it years earlier. He cites excellent examples of good writing including E.B.White and Joseph Mitchell. I would even recommend it as a high school or college text book."
2,Amazon purchase review,The book was not in the best condition. The price was cheap though so I can't complain. It's not falling apart or anything like that.
3,EINSTEINS,"A BIT SMALL BUT OTHERWISE OKAY. MY SON IS NOT A STUFFED OBJECT PERSON BUT STILLE ENJOYS THIS SMALL COMPANY OF THIS ROCKET,."
3,cute but small,"My daughter wanted a car, a plane, and a rocket ship for Christmas from Santa. She's four. There are no ""rockets"" for small children except Little Einstein products, which I couldn't find in the stores before Christmas or which were pretty expensive. I found this ""reasonably"" priced rocket on line. It seems pretty well made but it's small, which is fine for small hands to play with and for toy storage, but not worth the $15+ it cost after shipping (I had to buy it from a third party seller). The only reason I even bought it was because she wanted a rocket and there's few out there for littler girls (and they do watch Little Einsteins so she's familiar with it). I could have saved myself the money because I also bought her a Fisher Price Little People airplane and she thought that was a rocket. It cost about the same, but I got more for my money! It's bigger, with people and sound effects and more. Unless you have to have this thing, don't bother."
1,Badly written and unconvincing,"I found this book to be very clumsily written. The author's diction is too informal, and he rambles from one subject to another with little or no transition between topics. I was annoyed by the vast amount of irrelevant information that he included. For example, he interrupts his account of Olivia's first days in the Fischers' home to give a seemingly pointless account of the celebration of St. Nicholas's Day in Europe. Mr. Davis is also obviously biased in favor of Olivia Riner. I had the impression that he had made up his mind about Olivia's innocence before he even started his research for this book. He repeats outrageous charges and wild rumors about the Fischer family which were proven false in Joyce Egginton's book, ""Circle of Fire."" I believe that Ms. Egginton's account of the Olivia Riner case is far superior to Mr. Davis's."
3,A balanced account of this story,"I am not 100% convinced that Olivia Riner committed this murder despite what Joyce Egginton says. Maybe ""Circle of Fire"" was more in-depth than this book but at least Don Davis pointed out that the police screwed up major time. He pointed out that John Gallagher lied about being expelled from high school and that the half sister conspired with him to lie about his driving record to get him insurance. That is just as bad if not worse than Olivia stealing a bag of baby clothes. How do you justify the police not securing the crime scene? That is the first thing you always do in the case of a crime no matter what. I still do not buy Ms. Egginton's psychological theories. Things are vastly different today than they were 100 years ago when the dissertation was written. You are entitled to your opinion just as I'm entitled to to mine."
4,Phase II - solo.,"I'd heard some Babys & the single Missing You, But 3 years after the release of No Brakes (circa 88), a friend lent it to me & it blew me away. The other songs are Rockier.Saturday night's a good,up tempo opener & I love the last 4 Trax.Missing You is still a Fave - with all it's images of the time.This album turned me into a John Waite Fan - 'Nuff said."
5,Motorcraft Spark Plug Wires,Product arrived on time as advertised. Product was $50 less expensive than local Ford dealer.
2,Interesting but flawed,"The story of the 1848 California Gold Rush is quite interesting and this book brings out a number of interesting details. But the writing style is very informal and the book is not very well organized. The author makes some points that are, in my mind, very questionable. (he theorizes that Jesse James might not have been such a bad guy if his father hadn't gone off to mine for CA gold.)It was difficult to take this book seriously."
5,What ? Troma did not make Cannibal!,"Now I understand that everybody who likes Cannibal!The Musical will know that it was made by Troma............... WRONG! No, it was only put out on VHS & DVD by Troma,but had nothing to do with perduction of the film! Cannibal was a film that was refused by all the mayjor film companys, for exp. universal said that "" cannibal is one of the worst musicals ever made!"" and so thay tried to get other movie companys approved but..... was just flushed down the toliet. So thier last stop was Troma witch approved thr movie and was released by Troma.I saw this movie on Hot Choice ( A PPV channel) and thats when I first saw it and I thought to my self ( Now I know Troma made a film about cannibalism and it was a Musical and I said "" This cannot be A Troma Movie"".And they say "" Every time you think of Cannibal! The Musical,Think Troma!"" ""BULL!"""
2,A Rough Start,"As an enormous fan of Trey and Matt's work from Orgazmo, to Basketball, to South Park, I can't say I was disappointed with this movie, but I can't say I was satisfied either. There are a few amusing moments. The humor is very much that unique, quasi-satirical comedy that Trey and Matt are know for. The problem is that they had yet to perfect it when this movie was made.If you keep in mind that this was a very early attempt a movie-making for two hilarious individuals, you'll feel content. Don't expect much more. If they could edit 30min out of this movie it would be infinitely more entertaining. As it stands, it seems to run on for days."
4,Watch This For the Director's Comentary track!,"This is a movie where the comentary track helps make the film much more enjoyable to watch. Matt Stone and Trey Parker and a bunch of others who were in the film do the commentary track. They start out basically sober with a couple of bottles of Oban scotch, a case of beer, and who knows what else. The farther they get into things, the more plowed they get. (It also helps if you are drinking along with them.) In the process, they tell you what it is like to make a low budget film while in film school, what *not* to do when crossing a river, and just how many of the absurd details of the film are more historically accurate than many films about the same events!Even without the commentary track, it is a fun movie. It is very low budget. There are some weird continuity problems which are explained on the commentary track. (One of the bit players was VERY drunk during at least one of his scenes.) A great film to watch on a saturday night with friends."
4,"Love the Movie, though it was a little scratched up.....","I LOVE this movie, it's one of my all time favorites that I could watch over and over again. I bought this as a present for my husband for his birthday. It came extremely quickly, I believe within just 2-3 days. I understood before I bought it that it was used, so I expected some wear on the disc. Once I received it, the disc was scratched up pretty well. With our first time watching it there were no hang ups in the movie itself, so it worked just fine. I do have scratch repair for it just in case. It's a great price, great movie and the shipment came quickly. I gave it the 4 stars as it was a little more scratched than anticipated, but other than that, this seller is a good one."
5,"Golly , What A Swell Movie!","I would like to start by saying that this film is worth the 5 Star Rating I gave it, but I would be lying. 10 or so more like it. You've got a terrifc musical score along with some slapstick humor ,blood and guts gore , japanese indians , ballot and most important ... CANNIBALISM!!What more could you ask for. If you do not have a very Monty Python-esc sense of humor this may not be for you. Though you will definitely hear these tunes in your head long after the end whether you liked it or not."
5,Are you lookin' at my eye?,"For anyone that saw South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut, or Orgazmo, and was turned off by the swearing or inappropriate content, this movie is unbelievably funny with little swearing and almost no sexual references. If you loved the sex and swearing of those first two, and could go for some violence to boot, this movie is the greatest! The violence is almost nonstop, but it's not as disturbing as it is goofy. They use a ridiculous amount of blood and gore. It's hilarious. I recommend this movie for anyone that isn't a Puritan. By the way, what is it with Trey Parker and Mormons?Are you lookin' at my eye? ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT MY EYE?"
5,We Ate Our Shoes!,"Lovable doofus Alferd Packer is drafted under duress into leading an inexperienced team of gold prospectors into Colorado Territory. The team becomes horribly lost and is threatened by a diminishing food supply and lack of morale among the men. After Packer returns as the only survivor, he is charged with the crime of cannibalism, but the truth is a bit more complicated. Jam-packed with hilarious musical numbers, jokes and sight gags, this is a movie for the whole family as long as the whole family is horribly twisted. Make sure to watch it all the way through the credits for the disclaimer at the end! This movie was stolen by a local ne'er-do-well from my favorite video store and my only option was to buy it. Pop it in, share it with your friends, and bond with them over this celebration of the human spirit!"
5,Funniest cult movie I've seen,"This movie truely shows off the genius of its makers. The musical songs take things to a different level. My housemates and I have rented the movie over 10 times this summer, sometimes not returning it for a week or more.Lets build a snowman."
3,I feel a slight nibble,"I had been waiting for ever to see this ""masterpeice."" Rocky Horror of the 90's and rejected from every company except the great Troma due to it being ""unwatchable,"" Cannibal appeared as a lost classic. If you're looking for gore, you've got it, within the first five minutes that is. The movie then carries on as enjoyable but constant musical interludes that are vaguely suggestive of beastiality and ""Spadoinkle"" doings can drain the veiwer. Don't get me wrong, the dvd offers pretty decent features and the dialouge can reach a toned down Trey Parker humour but it did not reach the high expectations I had put forth. Songs about cannabalism while those singing eat themselves and others in a very cheesy b-grade way would have impressed me further. All in all, it was good movie but don't expect it to blow you away, it's more of a tease. A selfish little tease."
4,singing your guts out,canniblism at it's finest. i had the privlege of watching this movie tonight. i love matt stone. i would have his children if he paid for the sex change operation. this movie had me laughing all the way through. just the dumb plot has had me sniggering to myself all night. a must buy! add it to your home video collection now or be eatin in your sleep.
4,My heart's as full as a baked potato,"I can catch a helpless animal,Skin it with my bare hands.I wake up muddy,And I go to bed bloody,'Cause I'm a trappin' man."
3,"Good, not great.","I heard about this video a couple years ago at a video booth for Troma at a video producers show. I liked Trey Parker's other stuff and when I saw the flyer for the flick I was all up on getting it. That was until that I found out that due to it's limited distribution it was not available for rental in my market and available for sale in only a few places usually for around $70. I didn't want to see it THAT bad. I learned of the re-release through Amazon and bought it. Overall I loved the songs. They are cheeky and fun but the jokes were pretty thin. I was amazed at the quality given this is a film school production and the overall concept was humorous. If you are big Trey fan or love silly songs get it. If not, save your money."
4,Still no Shatterproof!!!!,"Had to purchase this one due to the fact that I'm in some of the Special Features. Had a blast performing in the Las Vegas production and updating the VHS copy was past due. However, I give this, dare I say cult classic, only 4 stars as the cut song ""Shatterproof"" is still missing from yet another Troma release of this film...sigh. What's wrong with you guys? I know it's an issue with Trey thinking that the song makes Packer seem too tough, but so what. Throw it in as an Easter Egg...something. Fans of the film want to see the scene. They would eat it up. (har-har).Give us what we want. Shpadoinkle"
5,"""Shut up, everyone knows your a chronic liar.....""","This movie is really funny. Plese note that this is NOT a historical account of what really happened in a comic style. This is about Alferd Packer. He was a cannibal. This is NOT his real story just ""funny."" You see, in this movie, he is telling the story, so, it's kind of a movie set through the eyes of the cannibal. And it is grea,.t The funniest parts are the 1 normal guy who's like ""why is everyone singing? This is not even a moment that calls for song!"" Or something tot hat effect. He does everything you want him to. For example, this guy is singing this hilariously annoying song ""Let's build a snowman, we can make him tall or we can--"" BANG! He's shot! LOL. Too funny. Anthir noteable quote is ""Uh....we're INDAINS!"" See it and you'll get it."
4,Commentary not very long...,"The other reviews here already say most everything you'd want to know about the DVD, but I hadn't seen one that mentioned that the hilarious commentary (and it is) only goes to about 2/3's of the way through the movie, stopping right before ""Let's Build A Snowman"". At first, I thought they were just all being quiet because they all loved the song (it's great too) but after that they never come back. I was eager to hear about some of the scenes that appear later in the movie but they don't get that far (must have been some 120 proof scotch or something). Anyway, buy this movie! But be aware that the commentary doesn't go all the way through. Oh, also be warned: You will be singing ""Shpadoinkle"" for weeks after seeing this movie."
4,Milk-out-the-nose funny!,"I am a big fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and this movie deffinately lives up to my expectations."
3,ok if you gotta lotta weed,"if youre bored and got enough weed and have laughed at orgazmo then you may enjoy this flick. its like an off broadway musical meets low budget comedy and horror (the blood looks like food coloring) but its better than ""jesus christ - vampire hunter"".....(theres a part in the movie where you can faintly hear a song in cartman's voice)"
1,"Will have to shoo the festering flies away, but","In order to appreciate this horrid piece of low low budget bucket o' feces, you have to watch this movie twice. After you watch it the first time, go back and watch it with the commentary on. Now it's not a movie, now it becomes an extremely funny tell all as they describe scene flubs, the back stories, etc,. The commentary deserves 5 stars as some of their comments had me in tears. As a South Park fan, I wanted to see the growth of their writing and it is obvious it has really matured. The wit had not hit here yet."
1,Krap with a K,"This movie was absolute krap. The only good thing about the DVD version is the T.I.T. II Troma Trivia. This movie is not funny at all, and if I had to listen to ""My heart is full like a baked potatah"" any more I'm gonna puke. The only reason you will laugh at this movie is due to the insanity you will get wondering why you bought this movie in the first place."
1,What a stupid thing to see!,"I'm a south park fan and bought this movie because I thought I could find something similar funny. Instead I found the worst thing I've ever seen. No humor, no shocking stuff, just stupid singing."
4,Justification for your DVD,"My appreciation for this movie increased ten-fold after purchasing Cannibal on DVD. There isn't enough room to praise all the extras. It's packed. As for the movie, some may be turned off by the low production value. But considering the budget (practically a Blair Witch budget) and the age of the filmmakers (21-23), this movie looks very good, even down to the ""colorized"" look of the film. Trey Parker's muscial score and sense of humor overshadow any budget limitations. The hilarious commentary in which they polish off two bottles of scotch during the course of the movie is also suprisingly informative. If you only own the VHS version, you're not getting the whole package. Check it out."
4,"Trey Parker, South Park","Hilarious movie if you are a huge South Park fan and Trey Parker/Matt Stone fan like I am. this is the first movie they made after/or during college. It is an independent film so don't expect the highest quality. Very funny/ goofy movie, with Trey Parker and Matt Stone voices that are often heard on South Park episodes!"
4,"Great commentary, funny film","We had a VHS copy of Cannibal! from a friend at Troma, and were excited to get the DVD - the director's commentary is a hoot, and seeing the behind-the-scenes clips and video of the live stage production had us in stitches.The film isn't the greatest, but the songs show Trey Parker to be a musical genius, and you can see where the early inspirations for South Park come from.Very funny stuff."
2,"don't know about the album, but the clips are totally messed up","New Rose was a great label in its day, and this album may well be a great compilation from their library, but it's very tough to tell when the songs listed are attributed to the wrong artists. Some of my favs from the '80's scene in Boston were recorded by New Rose, so it's more than a little frustrating to find that a rare Turbines recording is actually Willie Alexander (great though he is, doing one of his greatest songs); Barrence Whitfield is not the band doing Jungle Fever, and The Lyres are not doing This Party Sucks...c'est la vie..."
2,Second half of the book is misprint,Please note that the book I was sent to had a different story part way in the middle. Please watch out!
1,Boring book,I only bought it becuase we had to read it in english. Save sometime and look for another more interesting book
3,Not for a child,I bought this book for my son because he wanted to read it after having seen the movie. Definitely wasn't at a level he would be comfortable reading.
5,Good in every way,"*Unique science fiction story, well told and enjoyable enough to read more than once, which is why I bought it. I'd checked it out at the library several years ago and wanted to read it again, but they no longer had a copy.*Excellent service from the seller, book was delivered quickly and condition was as promised - like new."
4,really cute,"The overall look of the charm is great, really sweet. I only wish it was not hallow and flat on the back side of the charm. I do love the hook closure makes it fun and easy to move them around on your charm bracelet or place it onto a necklace. Most charms do not have this type of closure. It makes for a great gift."
3,"Great plush, one defect","Materials 5/5- The plush is made of great fluffy and soft material and colours.Design 5/5- The overall design and concept is great, the little pouch is a really cute touch!Quality 3/5- The overall quality is good but there is one rather sad issue with the one I received. The front white belly is supposed to have three little chevron/caret style marks on it. Mine seem to have been drawn on by hand with a black sharpie marker. They look more like little black splotched lines. So I'm a little sadened by this but the overall plush is still very nice, and I may have just gotten a lemon. I may try and fix the marks myself."
5,So Adorable!,This Totoro is everything the seller descripted and then some! It was much softer than I thought it would be and I got my shipment 3 days before the expected arrival date! Great for the price!
3,Different than the picture.,"The Totoro is more round and the arms are shorter than whats in the picture, but it's still a good Totoro plushie for someone who doesn't have $30+ to spend on other similar plushies. I ordered this on the 22nd of January and i got it on the 2nd of February! The only reason i'm giving 4 starts instead of 5, is because the product looks a little different than whats in the picture.*Update* I have added pictures of the Totoro Plush that i received into the product gallery.*Update*Since buying this they have raised the price from $4.59 +4.99S&H; to $27.95. If this plush looked like it does in the picture, then it would be worth $28, but it doesn't. I suggest people go to jlist . com and buy a real Totoro plushie, yeah it's more money, but at least you're getting one that actually looks like the picture and in good quality.Please look at the photo gallery and see the pictures of what it REALLY looks like before you pay full price for a knock off."
3,"Looks cool, but not durable","Within the first 5 minutes of receiving the toy, the weight belt had loosened to the point that it would no longer stay around batman's waist and the gun's stock was broken off. It is however very cool looking and the kids enjoy pretending it is on underwater adventures/battles."
1,Just did not work,"I read the mixed reviews about this item and decided to give it a try.First the positive: It looks stylishNow the negative: It just does not workI connected the Terk antenna to my HD FM receiver, hoping to improve reception in my basement, where I can't hardly get any HD stations at all. Well, the Terk antenna did not do anything for me here. OK, I thought, if there is no signal at all, the Terk antenna can't do much. Next I connected the Terk to my HD receiver in my living room. Here, the standard wire antenna gives me a decent signal and I can find HD stations. Not with the Terk! Reception was far worse than with the passive wire antenna. I played around with gain control and moved the antenna around - to no avail. Item is already boxed for return."
2,Not Good for Fringe Reception,I am in the area of fringe reception for my favorite FM station in Boston. I use a Bose radio but I could only get the station by using a rabbit ears antenna with maximum horizontal extension held at 180 degrees to the signal. So I know there is signal in the room. But this antenna couldn't find it. It should based on the write up but it doesn't
4,better but not perfect,using this in a cinder-block undergrade workshop i found this to be a good improvement over my dismal results without it. fm reception has improved to a point that i dont want to change the station. keep in mind i am in the boondocks. i would guess the signal improvement would be more in a more populated area. i recommend it and there you have it. mark
1,Did less than a dipole wire.,"Many comments warned of a useless device but I thought it worth a try. It may work in some places but in my rural area it did not bring any station I could not get with a dipole wire and it brought weak stations in worse than the wire. There was no difference between the antenna powered up and un-powered, which was particularly odd. Must be that the ""amplifier"" is a phantom. I moved the thing to many different locations but there was no improvement."
2,Lot of hype with little result,"I ended up throwing this thing away.It was just a terrible piece of equipment from the get-go.My old 300ohm twin lead did a better job (and it was free).Very disappointing, to say the least."
1,Not good for weak signals,This pretty little thing was a dissapointment. I was tired of walking around my living room with my old 52in dipole tryin gto find a sweet spot to get any signal above noise. I live in a very remote area. This antenna failed to pick any of the 5 stations I listen to on my simple unamplified dipole. I think this is for a metropolitan area with very strong signals and a user that wants to have the smallest most attractive looking antenna possible.
2,Looks good but mediocre performance,"Recently bought a new bookshelf system for the living room & it came with just a single wire antenna. The FM reception using that was pretty poor and it was difficult to position so that it was not a eyesore, so I decided to try the Terk. It does work better than the single wire antenna, but not as good as a simple dipole wire. I find that I need to keep the gain turned way down or there is a lot of added hiss (thus defeating the purpose of an amplified antenna). It does blend into the system and saves me from having to tack a wire to the wall so I will likely keep it, but if it was any more expensive I definitely return it."
3,Better than playing with wire,"If you live in a place where you can tape wire endlessly around the house you will get great FM reception. I don't and the wire that my receiver came with does not pull in any stations. This little gem works. The thing that blows is that it does not have enough length. Having said that, I placed it on a nearby window ledge without the ability to plug in the A/C adapter. It works good. It would work a lot better with a 25ft cord. Furthermore, it works better when it is not plugged in."
2,Only works well at window,"I ordered this to get better signal from new radio station w low power for a Bose radio (75 ohm coaxial connection). The antenna in the Bose radio worked better then the Terk amp. antenna when located on wall away from window. Even at 7 feet high the Terk did not pull in a better signal. Diode lights on counter also interfered with the signal and produced hum and static noise. The Terk did perform satisfactory when put on a window sill 8 ft from the radio, but for the cost this improvement was not worthwhile."
1,no help,this antenna was no help. one radio had the antenna in the power cord and no place to hook this antenna to. this did not help the reception on two other radios and one radio as you turned the knob for better recption it made it more static
1,Did not work well,This item did not improve FM reception on my Pioneer receiver. I returned it and purchased the Terk non amplified version which worked much better.
2,Still can't get out,I work in a machine shop and the radio we have we get a few station (All the one's we don't want) I ordered Trek to see if we could get more station or stronger reception didn't work for us. May work better in a house. Not around machines
1,Just didn't work.........,"I live in TX, about 80 miles from Austin and San Antonio. With a simple dipole antenna I can get about 3 reasonable stations on my Pioneer tuner. I thought I would try the Terk to see if a powered antenna would pull in a few more stations. Well, it didn't. In fact, some of the marginal stations that just weren't quite good enough with the dipole were worse or gone with the Terk. I fiddled with it over a few days, trying different times of the day, or different orientations ..... nothing helped. So I returned it for a refund. I think these units are overhyped. From what I've heard more people are disappointed than thrilled with the results. As always....""Your mileage may vary"" but it was no good in my situation."
1,Not as good as a 3 foot wire :-(,I installed this on a jvc bookshelf system upstairs where fm reception is very 'hissy'. This antenna pulled in a lot of other stations (not necessarily well) while creating more hiss on the npr station i was trying to improve reception for.the original 3 foot wire antenna provided by jvc worked at least twice as well as this powered unit.I tried it on another system (aiwa) with the same poor results (the 6 foot long wire antenna worked better on that system too)I would not recommend this unit. I am returning it to amazon for a refund
1,Disappointing,"My reception was considerably worse with this ""antenna"", as compared to a simple dipole (i.e. a single wire) antenna. I moved it around the room, different heights, different adjustments on the amplification dial -- still nothing. With one radio station (89.3 FM), it actually picked up a station on a completely different frequency (102.5 FM) even though my tuner was set to 89.3! Returned for a refund."
1,Waste of Money!,"I had hoped that this antenna could help me improve my reception and maybe even pick up some new stations. I live 40 miles outside of Boston.This antenna is only slightly better than having nothing at all. I am frustrated when I can pick up a station clearly in my car, when it sits in my garage, but I can't even receive it using this antenna, on my home stereo even after moving it around to various places and adjusting the gain.Either look into attaching speaker wire, or a better solution than this."
2,Looks nice,This is a fine looking gadget that added little or no improvement over the 75 ohm wire that came with my Tivoli Model Two. Since mine is being used in a suburban area perhaps it would benefit someone living in a rural environment.
1,very disappointed,"In an attempt to improve a weak signal I routed a cable to the second floor and using the wire antenna that came with the receiver improved the signal but it was still staticy. Thought the Terk amplified antenna would for sure improve this situation since I was getting a signal already. But no the signal was totally lost. Moved it around the room, adjusted the gain all to no avail. Wasted $34.00, shame on me."
2,Not much better than a piece of wire,I'm disappointed by the reception I'm getting; it's only slightly better than the piece of wire I had connected to my receiver.
2,Disappointed,"Used in Kansas City, Mo.Not only did the antenna perform poorly on local stations, no matter where it was placed, but the power wire is defective, has to be duct taped in place."
3,1970s Pulp,"This is pulp at its best! It reminds me of a slick, 1970s throwback directed by Quentin Tarantino. A bit outlandish at times, it is a quick read with plenty of action."
5,Callas' musical abilities,"Reading one reviewer's idea of Callas admitting to not being interested in her voice and technique and her being a sloppy vocalist I had a good laugh because it's totally untrue. Young Callas spent 14 of 24 hours a day at the conservatory. Then, a sloppy vocalist is hardly capable of singing Rossini's Armida to perfection, learning this most difficult role (Sutherland never sang it) in five days only, a time in which other famous songbirds struggle with just one cadenza. A sloppy vocalist isn't capable of doing ""I Puritani"" and ""Die Walküre"" in the same week. Before you act like an expert, do your homework or you'll expose yourself to ridicule.This Medea IS a milestone. The only Medea who had it all!"
2,Over-rated Mystic Star,"Plant arrived, skimpy in growth (few leafs) and the unusual sustained winter weather in early sprin on the East coast has tended to dey it up. Late Spring would be better, but by theb the plant is sold out."
4,Unser: An American Family Portrait,"The Unsers are the winnest family when it comes to the Indianapolis 500. Al Unser Sr. has 4 victories, Bobby Unser has 3 victories, and Al Unser Jr has 2 victories. Gordon Kirby does justice to this great American racing family. Although this book is no longer published, it is still an excellant coffee-table book or a must-have book for the serious collector of Indianapolis 500 memorabilia. The photography is superb. At the front of this book is the family tree and there is quite a lot information about other not-so famous Unsers, like Uncle Louis. Gordon Kirby is an excellent writer about auto-racing. In my personal collection, I have several books by Gordon Kirby and I love all of them."
5,Lighthouses of North America,"Lighthouses of North AmericaThis is a great piece of history , geography and visual for anyone about lighthouses facts, neeeds off merchants, ships and a view of the past."
2,Not in good condition,"This book was advertised as in good condition, I picked it up and the cover almost completly tore off! Thats not exactly good! I bought another book that was labeled as good condition and it was ten times better then this math book.Thanks-Adrienne"
2,This book is part of Elements of Argument: A Text and Reader,"I ordered this book thinking it was a companion to ""Elements of Argument: A Text and Reader "". This book is part of the latter. Why it's not mentioned in either of the books' reviews is beyond me."
5,wonderful and engaging,"A collection of music in the vein of the ""O Brother"" and ""Down From The Mountain"" albums - but these are original artists or vintage recordings. Includes two very different versions each of ""O Death"" and ""I'm A Man Of Constant Sorrow."""
2,Imposter,"If you are expecting to hear the same catchy tunes as from the movie, you will be in for a surprise."
3,Entertaining But Unreliable,"I bought this in hardcover when it was first published and received quite a bit of publicity in Los Angeles-based periodicals. I read it and found it to be quite entertaining. Wolf, who did the actual writing (Mader gave him raw research material), has a knack for writing in a concise, compelling way that does not overplay the inherently sensational nature of these stories. For years I also thought highly of the book because it seemed well-researched and accurate. My esteem for the book's reliability fell drastically during my extensive research on the life and death of actor Nick Adams, who receives a brief chapter here. Mader and Wolf's chapter on Adams's death is derived partly from John Austin's 1970 paperback ""Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries,"" itself an unreliable book. Then the authors added additional mistakes in their summary of Adams's life and the circumstances surrounding his death. Crime Magazine online has a thorough article about Adams."
5,Amazing teachings,"You will not find many quality teachings on the Holy Spirit with the modern teachers quite like you will in this book.As other reviewers have testified, Smith Wigglesworth was dependant on the Holy Spirit, and it is perfectly clear that outside this he was dealing in his own strength. The Holy Spirit is all about G-d and less of us - in fact the 'death' to our flesh. Are you prepared for that? For the mature Christian this mindset is challenging, and will draw you closer to G-d and further away from the world and your word of faith friends who want blessings for themselves and rather for the Glory of G-d."
2,"Not Vital, Not Essential, and Not Worth It!","This is perhaps the most beautiful book I own on the outside. The cover is awesome! But the written material inside leaves little to be desired. There is some historical significance in the sermons presented, and Smith Wigglesworth's focus was on God. However, reading these sermons leaves the reader questioning how he can perform the miracles rather than how great God is for being able to bless His people. There are many other Christian books which will enhance your spiritual life and lead you to a closer relationship with Jesus Christ. This book will only lead you to confusion and questions about how Christians are to live. Only the most disciplined and most studied of Christian should read this book. This book would be harmful in the hands of a new Christian."
4,Paraclete in action,"The Paraclete, which is translated as ""Advocate"" or ""Comforter,"" is the guiding force that shapes John's Gospel vision of Jesus. This Comforter is the Holy Spirit which enables one to heal, it's not Smith Wigglesworth who heals, but the Holy Spirit working through Smith Wigglesworth. The experiences and emotions Mr. Wigglesworth bears during his walk with the Lord are expressed in his writings. This is not an autobiography, it's the words he put down expressing the experience of having the Holy Spirit work through him."
4,A War of Our Great STARS,"When I bought this set on DG label, I was seeking to buy an EMI set of Franco Corelli. Because at that time in Corea it was said the EMI set would not be released more. I've selected this set since all the five protagonists are great and amazing singers of our century(Corelli, Price, Simionato, Bastianini, and Zaccaria)! Though this live performance was recorded regretfully in mono, you can feel excited and vivid as if you'd be now in Saltzburg Festival. But sadly this recording doesn't have Leonora's cabaletta (in 4 act)""Tu vedrai che amore in terra"" and Corelli's singing ""Di quella pira"" has been downed half-note."
5,Fans of Corelli and Price must have the video of both...,"Fans of Corelli and Price must have the video of both Price and Corelli if you love this Travatore as I do.This video of Price and Corelli, both prime and in flawless voice is a dvd call...Great Stars of Opera - Telecasts from the Bell Telephone Hour 1959-1966.It is as good as this essential Travatore and the sound is far better. And you get to see these two greatest of singers as they sing. It also has Tebaldi, Eileen Farrell, Rise Stevens and a young Joan Sutherland. You have to have the video if you get this cd. The DVD shows the 60's as the golden age of opera. Today's artist just don't compare to this!"
4,Worth Getting for Hawkwind Fans,"I delayed getting this one because someone made reference to it being covered in ""Complete 79."" Well, I did not do a side-by-side check for duplication, but the production quality is significantly higher than Complete 79 (which I still also recommend because it has so much more). Glad I got it. Complaints about early cut-of of Silver Machine are unfounded; I thought it an acceptable message that they were done playing that tune for a while. Besides, crank the explosion up a bit and enjoy the rumbling thunder."
3,not great but a worthy effort,"79 never really finds its groove. ""shot down's"" great, but the ""brainstorms'"" nothing speical. ""silver machine"" flies only about 30 seconds before exploding. Not horrible by any strech, but not one of thier best."
2,Nice Battery But Bad Idea,"The battery itself is very nice, and the idea behind the speakerphone inside the battery is very appealing. The only problem with this is the presentation of the speakerphone addon, specifically the microphone. It does not amplify the voice while ignoring the static/background noises, like most speakerphones.I *HIGHLY* suggest that if you want a vibrating battery and a speakerphone accessory, you should spend the few extra dollars for a cheaper battery, and the speakerphone desk-charger. THAT item is very useful."
5,An absolute must have CD!!!,"This CD has every track (including alternate takes) ever recorded by this obscure hot big band in New Orleans called The Owls in the 20's. This is rare and hot stuff, get it while it's still in print. Essential."
4,Yo-yo world by Harry Baier,"What can I say? Quite a bit, but I'll limit it nonetheless. This is a very, (note VERY) good book for learning how to yo. The tricks presented in this book range from those suited for the absolute beginner, to those who wish to take the sport seriously.Each trick is illustrated with enough depth to make it easy to understand, without overwhelming the reader. Did I also mention the variety of tricks?It also has a good wealth of information about the history of the yo-yo, and the different types of yo-yos available.My only real complaint is that like almost all yo-yo trick books available, it leaves the reader hanging just when they learn how to do the really good stuff. I can't find a yo-yo book for the life of me that has real in depth tricks like Superman, Yellow Planes or Green Smurf.Oh well. For the aspiring yoer in you, this is a great place to start."
4,Interesting release,This is a very interesting release with some different vocalists. Glenn Hughes and Tony Martin make it worth the price but he other singers are great also and I guess that is what keeps this CD going for me. From one song to another you get something different. The songs are inspiring and pit good against evil.
5,I love that book!,"this is my favorite book. if anyone has similar taste to me then i highly recommend them to read it.i'm going to describe it as a story of a girl growing into a women on the streets of the lower east side of manhattan. she tells of different jobs and the boarders that her and her mother board to help pay the rent. its very hard for me to describe becuase of 2 reasons 1) you can't describe it you have to read it 2)i read it a year ago.i was getting so into reading it that i never wanted it to end. to last forever. so i tried to do so by reading a limit of pages each day. i live in NYC and by reading the book i had grown a stronger love for the city and thats another reason i loved the book. i also loved the stories she has of her childhood. the down fall of the book? well, it was and made me sad. it was kinda a depressing book. you now. like a heart-acher.it was indeed a pleasure to read and in the future, if you do read it, i hope you enjoy.thats my review! i hope i helped!"
5,Bomb Diggy,"Yo! This album is the hottest I've heard in a long time. I understand he might come across a little rough, but if you think that is rough than you should have heard all of his other joints. Tracks like Neva Die Alone, that's on the CNN War Report album. He watered down this album a lot. Aside from maturing and being able to allow everyone to enjoy his music, Nori still does not forget about the fans that enjoy the rough, rugged, and raw. Every track is hot and every lyric is poetic, it's up to you to understand or try to. He's just illmatic and if you don't think so, and can't understand...then you never will!!!!!!"
4,It's not just rap or hip hop. It's composition. Period.,"Many have quibbled over their opinion of styles, music, which coast is better, too negative, too positive, whatever. The problem is everyone has lost sight of what we must appreciate. It is all art. Everything is not for everyone but Noreaga is on to something. With fantastic lyrics, and intoxicating beats, N.O.R.E. is something to be reckoned with. Lyrics like ""he was on some stupid sh-t, thinking he could 'real thing' when he was just a duplicate"". If you don't get it maybe there is something wrong with you.... You can't listen and talk at the same time. So shut up and dance y'all."
3,The original movie is better,"The original movie Ashes of Time was a masterpiece and gets 5 stars. Every shot of the film was like a painting, every line of dialogue was poetry.The only thing I like about the redux is the sharper images. The new music is not half as effective as the old music. The added titles severed the film into sections and disrupted the flow of the film. The new editing destroyed Leslie Cheung's narrative and rhythm of the film. I hate the bright yellow tint in desert scenes and green tint in some other scenes that make them look annoyingly unnatural. Brigitte Lin's dialogue was changed from the original Cantonese to Mandarin and sounds stiff, but is tolerable. I wish they had just cleaned up the image quality and kept everything else intact."
2,"Dream emsemble, nightmare of a movie.","I watched the movie the first time in a theater in Taiwan about 20 years ago. As the credits rolled at the end the crowd boo'ed and largely classified the movie as a failure. This redux is about the same. Art house reviews will praise this as a ""masterpiece"" but even the actors and crew suggested this was one of WKW worst films. He simply had a vision that was too grand and had to stymy it down into this compressed version of a movie. For those in the know, this is an epic tale that spanned 3 books and although this movie is loosely tied to the books, the characters lacks all background to make it significant to the audience (for instance Jacky Cheung's &#21271;&#19984;). This was a failure the first time around and nothing's changed."
3,Chinese Art Film,"Maybe Chinese Film director Mr. Wong KAR Wai, set out to make a martial arts film, but ended up in my opinion with perhaps one of China's, first art films. Ashes of Time Redux, is a story of life, love and lessons learned by those characters involved, and shared with us in the passing seasons of, Ashes of Time Redux"
2,at at first you don't succeed...move on,"On principle, I object to filmmakers going back years later and re-editing and rethinking a movie they made. But if you're going to fiddle with the past, at least present the new cut side by side with the original, something this DVD fails to do. Not that it matters: director Wong kar Wai hasn't had any more luck creating a compelling drama out of this mannered action flick that prefigures the unique style of his that would flower on great films like Chungking Express and In The Mood For Love. But everything he attempts here -- basically trying to bring a depth of performance and genuine conflict to an action flick -- is done much better by Ang Lee with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. A mess, albeit a somewhat cleaned-up one. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
2,Chinese sloooooo,Typically sloooow Chinese film about a guy living out in the boonies .Way out in the boonies. Takes in a young girl and watches her continually raped and molested. Difficult and hard to follow.Sad and pathetic but if you like this type of Chinese flick it may be right up your alley
5,That Good Old Holiday Feeling,"Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme were one of my favorite singers growing up,and I got to see them in person in 1979 in Vegas.The best track on the CD is ""That holiday Feeling."" Its such a funny,sexy,wonderfull CHRISTmas track,along with all the other cuts.I can't wait to start playing this record to get me into that ""Holiday Feeling."""
5,A Christmas Tradition,"My family & I decorated the Xmas tree every year, singing along with Steve & Eydie and now my Grandchildren join us."
5,CD By Steve & Eydie,I was so happy to finaly find this CD! I have looked for YEARS!!!! The last copy I had was on 8 track tape. I have missed the feeling it gave me as I was decorating for the Holidays!!
5,inexpensive and fun,"At the prices offered through amazon via GEM avenue, you can really have fun accessorizing your wardrobe. Good quality for the money and if you lose or misplace it, it's kind of no big deal. I just enjoy having a variety of fun stuff to perk up my mood. My girls think it's fun too.... You won't really fool anybody with a good eye, but WHO CARES, it just should be fun! Cute ring. FUN."
2,"good music, but with too much background noise","good music, but with too much background noise. Her the Italian version is recorded, that important message should be shown on the cover. Thids version is not dull, but there is adifference with the french version (next to the language)."
4,Funny!,"I've watched this three times over the past week with my daughter. We laugh harder every time. It has some of the anarchy of the old Looney Tunes shorts. At the price, you can't go wrong."
3,"Very entertaining, in an intentionally goofy way.",I particularly liked all the insider movie jokes as well as the art jokes. Much better than the previous basketball themed movie.
4,Classic Looney Tunes Style,"Back in action does a great job of keeping the true Looney Tunes style in a new movie, The characters are drawn in the original style, not the 60's animated style. While some people may not notice little things like the stray strands of fur on Bugs and Daffy it makes a big difference to me because the characters just don't seem the same. There are so many little things in this movie that after watching multiple times you will still find new things that you didn't see before. Brendan Frasier and Jenna Elfman do a good job working with the Tunes the movie feels natural unlike a lot of live action movies. If you're looking for recent Looney Tunes with classic style this is an excellent choice."
5,Good deal,"I was impressed with the price and it shipped quickly, It showed up in great shape, and it is in better condition than I expected. works quite well, I will definitely Do business with this place again."
2,Lose the humans,"The movie is fun, but the actors ruin it. The interaction between the cartoon characters are funny and a trip down memory lane. The scene in the Louvre is funny. The plot is horrible. WB should stick to a animated movie, 100% animated."
2,Overrated and Boring,"This movie is a good movie people said? Well, this is one of the stupiest movie I've ever seen. Especially if you have watch SpaceJam, it was a good movie but this one Back in Action, a huge disappointed more like it. For crying out loud, what or where is the plot for this movie at all? Well, there isn't really one. A lot of things in the movie was trying to be funny but it was only making the movie more stupid than it already was. At the begining of the movie was kind of funny but from that point everything is pretty much stupied and boring. Some part of the movie was not even making any sense either. If this is a good movie then I suppose I can make a movie too without a plot and without making any sense.I can't believe people like this movie so much. Overall this movie is overrated but then movie like this is getting worse and worse each year."
1,NOT a family film,"Don't be fooled by the commercials and critic's reviews of this movie. It is not a family film. It is full of inappropriate scenes, dipicting the actresses scantily clad in extremely tight suits or dresses. This is not a movie for little kids, it would have been great without all the innuendo, movie producers nowadays just throw in something nasty into a ""family film"" so they have a reason to rate it PG so more people will see it because ""everyone knows that G rated movies don't draw as many people as a PG or PG-13 movie, right?"".Other than that it is an OK movie, with some laughable humor and okay actors. The cartoon characters seem overdone. Steve Martin is good but they put him in an incredibly annoying role.In short, do NOT buy this movie for your young kids, it is not appropriate. Buy it if you just want to add it to your Looney Tunes collection or if you want to watch it with some other adults. The one star is for special effects, some good acting, some humor and some stunts."
4,Loving Luney Tunes,"I loved the Luney Tunes Back in Action video. I ordered this on a 1 day ship on a Thursday for an upcoming birthday present that was that Sunday. I was very disappointed when although I paid the extra shipping (almost as much as the DVD itself), it did not arrive until the next Monday after her birthday. I know that delivery dates are approximate but I think it would be helpful if your site let the customer know that 1 day ship does not happen if it is after 12 noon or something like that."
3,Good (not Great) Looney Tunes Movie,"After watching Space Jam with my 6-year old daughter, I thought that this movie might be fun. Although it has a few laughs, it is not a great movie. My daughter seemed to lose interest pretty quickly. Space Jam was much more entertaining for both of us. It seemed like there was too much plot getting in the way of the fun with this movie. But, it is always nice to see the Looney Tunes gang. I miss watching Bugs and Daffy every afternoon. Oh, those were the good old days."
2,"OK, I guess","Price is certainly no guarantee of quality. I've noticed, though, that movies with lasting value tend to command higher prices in the used market, even years after their initial release. The pittance asked for this flick really does reflect its value.It's watchable, barely, but not one I want to own.-- wiredweird"
5,Greatest movie,"I thought looney tunes back in action was terrific. It atomatically rated five stars in my book. A must see for all brendon fraser and looney tune fans. Was infinitelly funny, with plenty of good humor and action to go around."
2,My Favorite Looney Tunes In The Worst Film Ever,"I had such high expectations for this film, which is probably why I was so disapointed in it. It could have been so much better. When Warner Bros. fire Daffy Duck, he runs off with a security guard(Brendan Frasier) to save his father from the evil head of acme(Steve Martin). Bugs Bunny and a studio executive(Jenna Elfman) venture out of Hollywood to bring back Daffy. It all turns into a quest for a crystal that can control the world. The plot is wacky and fun, but somehow, there are all kinds of holes and moments where the story isn't moving at all. The effort needed to pull this film off was not applied.The DVD treatment is better than this film deserves. A new short and deleted scenes are the highlights. I recomend ""Who Framed Roger Rabit"" instead of this film."
1,Lunatic Tunes-Back in Traction,"Warner Brothers' Looney Tunes were classic cartoons back in Hollywood's Golden Age of the '30s and '40s. Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Elmer Fudd blended humor with current events and even opera. ""Looney Tunes-Back in Action"" is an awful mess of cartoons with live action. Brendan Fraser heroically puts up with it, Steve Martin hams, and Jenna Elfman brings in her ditzy Dharma persona from ""Dharma and Greg.""""Looney Tunes-Back in Action"" is a comedy without humor. Granted, there's slapstick and visual tricks, but it lacks the humor that gave Looney Tunes their magic in the '40s. The plot (such as it is) is needlessly convoluted. Every single Warner Brothers cartoon character is dragged in. Brendan Fraser&Jenna; Elfman wander aimlessly,going from a compound with space aliens to the desert. There are loveable cheesy movies-this isn't one of them. It's an unfunny trainwreck."
2,A dismal disappointment,"Having seen Spacejam, I was all up for seeing this film. It is boring, poorly acted and the plot is idiotic. It is everything that Spacejam wasn't. Go rent Spacejam instead and save your money on this. Brenden Fraser seems to always make a turkey when he gets involved in cartoons (Dudley Do-Right was another bomb).If you want to see Brendan in a funny movie, I suggest Bedazzled."
2,one huge boring disaster...........,"i could not wait for my dvd to arrive last week, and, sorry folks, here's one i simply cannot finish! it's a nonsensical crashing bore! not the toons, not frazer, elfman, or martin can give it any life! a total waste of money. picture quality and audio very high quality, but that's about it."
1,Looney Toons needs to retire for good. Do something original,"Nobody cares for the looney toons anymore people grew out of it and our young generation of little kids today don't even know much about it.Joe Dante disgrace the original creator's and master's of the looney toons, they have to be looking down from heaven right now and their spirits are plaining to give him nightmares cause he ruined their characters. These are the ones I'm talking about (Bob Clampett, Frank Tashlin, Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery, Friz Frelong, Bob McKimson, Chuck Jones, and Mel Blanc). Their defentaly rolling over in their graves right now.As far as this movie all I know is Bugs and Daffy have team up with live action people Brendan Frasier, and Jenna Elfman to save the world from a evil Acme Corporation the head bad guy is a nerd. The bad guys need a magical diamond to fulfilled their deads."
5,Mickey pollywag,Wonderful item that came in fantastic shape. I plan to odder goofy & the wizard as soon as I can!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Only the first chapter is well explained,"I liked the first chapter but the other chapters are two short and difficult to understand. The price of the book is too high.I have more than ten books about Java. I like Andy Harris's book (step by step explanations;all exercises work fine), Schildt's books (all the exercises work fine),and K.N.King's book.We need several books for learning Java, because no one is perfect."
5,Excellent Book,"I've been programming for 2 1/2 years now in Java, and this book is what gave me my start. Before that, I bought all the Java books I could get my hands on, but I couldn't grasp the logic of OOP until reading Yakov Fain's book. Plain English, easy-to-read and great examples. I still occasionally refer to the book to try new things in Java (like Serialization, RMI; etc). Great book if you're a beginner or a confused intermediate! This book for you. It presents the Object Oriented Programming concept in a clear and simple approach. Examples are short, clear, and precisely to the point."
3,too many typos,"The descriptions and examples were easy to read and follow. However,I was dismayed at the large number of typographical and grammatical errors in the descriptions and explanations..apparently little or no proofreading was performing prior to printing. That makes me wonder: if there are easy-to-spot typos in the 'plain-English' text, how many typos might be lurking in the Java code examples?Unfortunatly it doesn't appear that there has been a any updated/corrected edition from the original 2002 printing."
4,This Product Does A Fine Job,"What it is: a non-powered loop antenna with a rotating dial (just like the manual tuner on a radio)that you use to adjust until the signal is optimized. The wire leads have been tinned with solder to keep the twisted wires neat and easy to insert into antenna connector on your radio. It improved reception quite a bit, it was able to take signals that were not really audible and covered with 'hash' and make them at least audible. Using my 'yardstick' of product value and quality, this product is just about the last resort before having to install an outside rooftop antenna."
1,Can I give it zero stars?,"A friend loaned me the book. Thank goodness I didn't spend money on it. The author writes like a 15 year old. So many exclamation points. All that it was missing was text-speak and it would be a bad teen's diary. Ms. Jordan, bad, uninspired, hackneyed, trite, and cliched dialog and inner monologue cannot be rescued, resuscitated, or otherwise improved simply by adding an exclamation point. The premise was sound, the execution horrible. I generally read romance novels but by much more skilled authors. Are all Harlequin novels this bad? I don't think so as I've read some of this type of short romances before that, because of their brevity, were not fulfilling as far as plot development went but they weren't painful to read. Avoid this book unless you want to turn it into a game using liquor and the exclamation points. You want good romance, try Jessica Bird aka JR Ward, Vivi Anna, Julia Quinn, Lisa Kelypas, Mary Balogh, or Katie MacAlister."
5,Excellent! Required reading for Women of all ages,"This is the most influential book I've read on getting control of my money. It is not a book about budgets, investing, etc. It should be read long before any of that! It should be required reading for women in high school.The book talks about the beliefs, attitudes and fears women have about money. Some have been inherited from the culture in general, some from our families. All are important to identify for yourself (hopefully at an early age!) so that you can modify them before they get you into financial trouble. I found myself in several of the chapters, even some that outlined phobias I wasn't aware I had. The awareness alone has been worth the price of the book. (It takes a lot more to actually change all the beliefs, etc.)I highly recommend this book to women, and I think men might also find it insightful as well."
5,JoeX of Third Coast Music Network reviews My Lucky Day,"In this record, my ears hear all the components that make TCMN what it is-gritty, roadworn, sparse yet full production, loose yet confident style. JW's voice is as rough as a weatherbeaten oak plank. Sings like it was the last song of a long, smoky nite. Half shouts/growls some lyrics. It works. Songs about everything from lost loves (Missing You This Morning) to Blues Nuggets (st. James Infirmary). Barrelhouse feel to entire disc. Not a blues album in the strictest sense, yet embodies the ""soul"" of the blues I personally like the best, Country Blues, but is a bigger production than most Country Blues records. Grit Factor: 5"
5,Two years and still look brand new,"Purchased these two years ago and they still look brand new on the outside and I wear them pretty much non-stop throughout the winter months. They're loose on the heels, but come up high enough over the arch so that they don't slip off and there is plenty of room in the toes for moving around. They're fantastic for airline travel since they easily slip on and off for security and walking long distances isn't a problem at all because they're light while still being supportive."
3,"Good Story, Tedious Writing Style","This is not her best work as it is marred by her writing style, which is boringly repetitive. Every other page she uses the same adjectives to describe her key characters. She creates a great storyline and then makes it tedious by the non-stop arguing between the characters. Give me a break! You almost want to throttle the heroine to shut up, as does one of the highway men, who thought initially he fancied her too. Another tedious distraction is the converstaion her heroine keeps having with her conscience. It adds nothing to the book and is annoying. I very much enjoy Ms. Lindsey's books in general and hope to read all of them. This, however, was not one of my favorites."
1,UGH,"I remember reading this years ago and thought I had liked it, after re-reading it recently I don't see how that's possible. This book is HORRIBLE. The hero/heroine literally fight from the first scene to the last scene. The story makes no sense, it's really ridiculous. The first sex scene really cannot be described as anything other than date rape. (And I am not prudish about love scenes, but this one isn't sexy at all). The heroine is an annoying shrew who didn't even deserve her happy ending. I mean, WHO would lie and tell their husband they miscarried a baby when they didn't?? She's a nightmare. He is pretty mean to her in the beginning and then as soon as they are married and he is back to being a duke his personality changes completely and he's like a totally different person. This is not a love story at all, it's a fight story. And it's a long, annoying fight that makes no sense. Skip this one."
5,Man of my Dreams,I loved this book. It was a great inspirational story. When I read it for the first time I was pregnant for my first child that I happened to name Devlin. Thank you Johanna Lindsey!!!
3,THIS BOOK WAS ALRIGHT,"I'll admit that it is an interesting story but the charactors seemed kind of boring. Devlin was charming but Megan was just too boring.There was also not enough action between the two charactors and the story it's self. It was worth reading, but I have read much better books from JL."
5,AMAZING!,"JOHANNA LINDSEY is amazing. I think I love this story the most! I laughed got ticked off, it was just over too soon. The characters were amazing, the scenes changed, it is a great story! action, drama, romance, comedy! the horror is that it ended to soon! lol"
5,On of the BEST!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book from start to finish. Lindsey creates characters that just knows how to grab you and won't let go. They seem to jump right from the pages. This is one of my absolute favorite! I'm happy to say that I've read this book 4 times and enjoyed it tremendously each time. Devlin and Megan certainly does have an explosive chemistry. They have charm and they have wit. Devlin IS a man of women's dreams and Megan is extremely charming. You will enjoy this book enormously. I highly recommend it to EVERYONE. It's a real PAGE TURNER. Once you've start, you won't let go and that is a promise!"
2,Very disppointed in this book!,"I had read all of J. Lindsey's Malory books and was all set for another great story. What I found was that there was ton of potential here with this story, but it never developed. We never learn really why Megan is so bent on marrying a titled gentleman, nothing except she has been snubbed, but that wasn't believable enough. I never felt her character developed beyond that of a spoiled brat and I never felt any connection to the characters. Usually I root for the characters to come together. With Devlin and Megan I could care less and that disappoints me."
1,Trash,This was a horrible book to read. I don't recommend it at all. There are much better books out there so why waste your time on a poorly written book with shallow charaters and a thin plot?
5,Man of my dreams,Absolutely loved it. Can't wait to read the next installment. Was the best story. Johanna Lindsey keeps you on the edge of your seat. Keep them coming.
4,"Great job, Johanna!","This was a really good book; I love Devlin and the plot is so cute. Megan is awesome and fiesty, but not annoying."
5,A book for any one who is a romantic at heart,"This is one of my favorite books I've read it more times than I can count. Johanna Lindsey is one of the best romance writers of this time, any one of her books is a good read. This one in particular will keep you on the edge of your seat. The tension will keep you turning the pages to see what happens next, and what happens next you won't believe."
3,"OK for undergrads, if you can put up with the typos","This book is, I suppose, an acceptable elementary introduction to the topic. However, I found that several important proofs were annoyingly incomplete, with the tag ""the proof is too difficult to go into here."" Many times, the only ingredient needed to complete the proof is the Inverse Function Theorem or the Implicit Function Theorem, which students taking differential geometry should know. Also, and more significantly, the exercises are riddled with typos; some are minor, others make the exercise incomprehensible. A final minor quibble is that the author uses a cumbersome numbering system for his sections. In sum: If your mathematical background is at least as strong as that of a senior honors undergraduate mathematics major, look elsewhere (perhaps ""Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces,"" by do Carmo). If not, and you still would like an introduction to the field, this book may foot the bill--just beware of the typos in the exercises!"
2,Only works randomly,"I read all the positive reviews and gave this product a try. Unfortunately, I experienced the same problem that only one reviewer had: the heart monitor only worked at random times.I would put the strap on, tried adding gel to allow better contact, but the watch would monitor my heart rate for a few seconds and immediately loose its signal.I returned it. Too bad since it looked like a nice product from a well known company."
4,"Works great, very comfotable","Most comfortable watch I've ever owned and is easy to keep clean. Full functionality of the Ironman series is a huge plus. It does not work with our existing chest straps but the one that comes with the watch is comfortable. Takes a bit longer (1-2 minutes) to accurately pick up my heart rate than other products used. Overall, would purchase again."
4,Very Nice and Basic HRM,"I am very pleased with the functionality and style of the watch. My previous HRM was from Polar. Not only was it so ugly on my wrist I felt I could only wear it while working out, it only lasted 1 year before it began malfunctioning.This watch does everything a serious but not UberGeeked athlete would want from a HRM. It gives you chrono, it gives you zones, it gives you an easy to read display. It doesn't take a degree in engineering from MIT to work its different modes.Good watch for a fair price."
5,Great Value!,"I am very pleased with this product and have had no problems with getting a continuous read on my heart rate. Besides this, it's a full-feature watch. I paid more than this price for my last watch, which had no heart rate monitor. I highly recommend it!"
2,watch vs heart rate monitor,"The watch is fine however the heart monitor works only some of the time. If I had to do this over again, I would not have purchased the item."
2,Don't use in the water!,"Great watch... great heartrate monitor.Just don't expect to use it in the water. I clouded up after only 1 swim. I sent it back to Timex... they replaced it, but my new one did the same thing only a few week later when I wore underneeth my leather motorcycle jacket on a warm summer day ride when my sweat did the same thing. Chances are... the button was pushed by my jacket sleeve allowing persperation to leak in."
3,Decent HR monitor/Watch,"I bought this as a beginners HR monitor and I think it worked fine in that role. Not too many features, yet enough for me to get started.Overall I liked it. However, after a few months I feel I am outgrowing it."
4,Good Basic Functions,I started running a few weeks ago and was looking for a decent priced heartrate monitor without a lot of frills...and this is it. It is very easy to setup and use.
5,Perfect for anyone who needs a word quickly.,"This dictionary leaves no word left out. Each entry has all the possible ways you might want to use that word in a sentence, along with many common phrases."
5,What more can I say?,"There is nothing I can add to any of the other reviews. This is, by any standards a great recording of beautiful singing that is, unfortunately, a thing of the past. Anyone who enjoys french opera needs this recording."
4,A glimpse into how the Japanese view the natural world,"The haiku is my favorite form of poetry, the seventeen syllables with 5, 7 and 5 in each line is succinct and would appear to be too restrictive. Yet, it is very rich and dynamic, as is demonstrated in this book. The haiku originated in Japan in seventeenth century and this is a collection of works by Japanese authors. Therefore, as is always the case, some of the original meaning is lost in the translation.There are four chapters of haiku, one for each of the seasons. This is followed by a chapter of odes with the title ""Landscapes of Life and Love."" To Westerners, the Japanese people often seem incomprehensible and insular. One of the best ways to understand a culture is to examine their literary forms and this book is a window into how the Japanese think about the natural world."
2,A sorry production.,"For those of us who remember the show, these are a poor substitutes.The continuity and editing are sub-standard at best.The flow of scenes are staggered and jumpy.The amount of action is high. Bruce kicks alot of butt, however, some are edited in from episodes not included in the story line.The special feature of the Black Beauty was really good.The fury of the dragon 2 is worse than the first.I will wait for a box set of the episodes."
3,Enjoy the creatures....ignore the acting,"Filmed as the '70s drew to a close, ""Planet of Dinosaurs"" represents one of the last examples of the skillful use dinosaur stop-motion animation before computer animation began to dominate the scene. For fans of the art, this is a worthwhile entry. Granted, the acting by the humans involved is pathetic. So just ignore it and enjoy what the special effects artists on this film identify in the commentary as a tribute to Ray Harryhausen. And a worthy effort it is!"
2,Un nostálgico,"Curioso film de ciencia-ficción y aventuras prehistóricas. Los efectos especiales dejan en evidencia cierta falta de presupuesto y respecto al argumento, creo que se podría haber sacado más partido.Aún así la película se ve con agrado."
4,Good fun for Friday night,"This movie is SO 197os, from the costumes to the dialog. But it's still a lot of fun for those of us who remember Friday night monster and/or sic-fi films on TV - or the drive in. The stop-motion dinosaurs aren't bad. Not up to Harryhausen standards, but definitely better than many other of the gender. I'm glad I added this to my collection. If you don't mind 70s campiness, you may very well enjoy it, too."
1,Earth calling...,"I find it impossible to give this movie with its' actors, script and effects (+++) more than one star. It is clearly made by amateurs, and probably they had to pay for this themselves. It looks... crazy! The dinosaurs look really false, and the acting is terrible.I saw this movie when I was a little boy, it was scary back then, so I had to buy this out of that value - and it was fun to see it again. It looked a lot better back then though...The music... Well, whatever, nevermind =)"
5,This movie is PERFECT!,"Sometimes production companies try to make a b-movie, and it's no secret that it's supposed to be funny. Those moves are lame. Planet of the Dinosaurs, however, is AWESOME. Each line of the horrible dialog is delivered with all the intensity of a Knight Rider-era Hasselhoff. You actually get the impression that they were trying to make a decent movie, and that makes it even more hilarious. I first saw this on tv when I was a kid. I was excited to see that it was out on DVD! The dinosaurs are most likely totally innacurate and out of scale if you asked a paleontolgist, but see, these are SPACE dinosaurs! ROCK! The best part is the plot. They crash, some of them die, and then they never find a way off the planet! It just ends with a scene of them washing their clothes in a pond! Their space suits are rad, and the dude's beard is sweet! Easily worth 5 stars."
2,Dinosaurs (...),This movie is all about dinosaurs and some story thrown in for good means!A spaceship crashes on a desert planet inhabited by dinosaurs.The crew tries to survive and some get eaten by carnivores in bad mood.Thats about it!There is plenty of well executed stop motion and funny dialogues from an innocent age of b-movies.It's not Gone with the Wind but it sure has entertainment values.The DVD quality could have been better in dark scenes (...)
4,Great Film,THis is a Great Flick about Dinosaurs. Its Cool And you fans out there who like stop-Motion Movies then this one is perfect for you . i like it.
3,Standard Quality,"The cables shown in the picture are different then the one you get! Those in the picture are of high quality, the cables you get are of standard quality, but they will do the job!!"
2,"not well organized, no color pictures","Cans are categorized by State, so you have to hunt through the entire book if you don't know what state the can is brewed in; this is a poor method of organization."
3,I have not seen this book,I just want to know when this book was published.I have other books on beer cans but they are 7 to 15 years old.I just want to find a updated price book on beer cans. Can any one help me??
1,OLD BOOK,Got the book. Cant use it. Old price guide. Thought I was getting something to view current prices. Very unfortunate.
4,Great for kids! Humorous for all ages.,"I bought this game to play with my younger sister because I remembered playing it when I was younger. She enjoyed it and was sad when it was over. Although she has completed the game, she played it several more times. There are many environmental interactions on the game which are humorous. There is singing, dancing, and a few added distractions that are silly, but funny. Most children would enjoy this game and it's not too monotonous or dull for an adult to sit and assist the child."
1,Freddi does not load,Wish I had read the reviews first! Faulty program cannot be read by computer at all. I spent an hour trying to no avail. Will contact Amazon?
1,Where's the game?,"I received a disk with the freddie the fish cover. When i attempted to put the game on for my twins, the disk could not be read."
5,tiffany address book,"This address book is really beautiful. It is well-made with gorgeous pictures and plenty of space for name, address, telephone, cellphone and email entries. Picture-perfect."
5,Betty Rocks!,"Pray for the Soul of Betty is an amazing band led by Constanitne Maroulis of American Idol fame. The band has a sound that is unique to the music scene today. As their website states, ""Intense, raw energy fused with sex, serious contemplation, and excess."" Truck Stop Sally is a lyrical gem. The song will stick with you long after its over. All of the songs will have you singing (and possibly banging your head) right along with the band. I highly recommend picking up this CD as soon as you can!"
1,"Poor arangements, poor mix, poor quality sound, voice not good!","He could have done better, the sound, mixing, mastering was so bad. His voice dosent even sound like Constantine, he could have done better, for me its a very low buget cd. Even the cover is not appealing. Im honest!"
1,All swears!,"Constantine proves he cannot carry a tune. The music is bad and he sings worse than on TV!! If you can believe that! Dont' bother with this garbage.Bo Bice has the best CD ever made, The Real Thing, and it's a SMASH hit, outselling Constantine by a MILE. Try it for yourself and you will see what all the people are buying, Bo Bice!! Buy this you will love it and will become addicted to listening to every song! Amazing debut for theextraordinary AMAZING, Bo Bice!!"
1,Let's be real,"After hearing this attempt at rock, it's rather disappointing. I realize that I will probably offend most of the world when I say this but Constatine's band is more of an American idol than he is. Growing up in the music industry and producing my own albums I've heard talent and the band has that. But the vocals lack. Next all of you that hate me by now will say that I'm jaded. Not true otherwise I'd be trying to sell you my CD's. I suggest anybody who just loves Constantine buy this album. Anyone who loves music stay away from it otherwise you just promote more bad music. Constantine go to the theatre where you belong."
1,Talentless poseur,I can't beleive so many people bought into Constantine's shtick! He tries way too hard here. This isn't any different than any of the other recyclable hard rock acts like Godsmack that get shoved down our throats. I'm glad he is off Idol-just seeing him ham it up each week and seeing all of the teenage girls out there lap it up made me want to vomit! System of a Down and Audioslave have new releases coming out in the next few weeks- do yourself a favor and save your money and spend it on some real rock music.
4,Superb debut- really fun LOUD HARD ROCK!,"I love this fun, loud obnoxious debut- really great hard rock with an edge yet strong vocals and musical talent all around make this one of the more exciting debuts in a long time. Constantine and PFSB have the potential to rock the mainstream like Guns n Roses fronted by Mr Rose in the 80s. Very approachable rock with a hard edge- way too real for popster driven Idol.I love Truck Stop Sally- it is my fav track."
1,Pray for the soul of WHAT!?,This is by far one of the crappiest albums I have ever listened to. The sound was rushed. The vocals are cheesy to say the least. The fruit cake that fronts the band is in bad need of a new hair style at least. If I had payed for this CD I would have felt ripped off. Do yourself a favor save your cash and go buy a Dolly Parton album.
1,I Thought It Would Be Much Better !,Looking so forward to this album - this is a very poor excuse - hope the future brings much better !
5,The new sound of Classic Rock,"The best cd I bought this year, is definently this one! My favorite song on the album is ""Truck Stop Sally"". Every track is meshed like a yummy stew....lots of spices and taste oh so good! I love it!"
5,PFTSOB is Wicked Sexy!,I cant get enough of this CD and have listened to it every day since I got it. All the songs have a great edge to them and put you in a feel good mood. You will not be disappointed in these sexy rockers!!
3,UNREAL...,"I cannot believe they let Constantine release an album before Carrie did. But that is why he was booted of American Idol. Just a few days before his elimination, it was reported that he already had a recording contract with his band and producers of the show felt that that was unfair to the other contestents, so they let him go. I am kind of glad though, because if her stayed he probably would have won. I haven't heard to the album yet, but I am looking foward to."
5,Awesome sexy entertainment!,"This cd was a surprise to me! I bought it, like many people, as a fan of Constantine Maroulis. I found it to be very different from what he had sang on American Idol. Of course, those Idol tunes, we all know, are directed to the contestants who have no say. No excuses, but Constantine Maroulis really pulls out the plugs in this cd, as do the rest of the band, including Taylor and Hamboussi, the drummer! The vocals are a little underheard with the loud beat of the music, but that is just the key to this well written cd and very well acclaimed cd! It has a twist and a turn at every corner! It's surprising and you find yourself wanting to go back and listen again and again and again to the songs to make sure you got them right! Unparalleled performance for an up and coming band ... by all means explore and enjoy ... close your eyes and LISTEN!Bev"
1,Disappointing,"I was a big fan of Constantine Maroulis during his stint on American Idol, and the only reason I purchased this CD was because it ""featured"" him. I was very underwhelmed with this glorified demo of a release, and any honest fan will tell you the music (reminiscent of every 90s grunge band you wanted to forget) isn't quite up to it -- otherwise it would have sold more, and PFTSOB really would be the ""next big thing.""I will happily continue to support Constantine's _solo_ efforts as any true fan of HIS would, but I will not be used by Betty bassist Craig Taylor to promote music I don't believe in or be manipulated into buying multiple copies of this disc, as so many others have been."
3,Chicks,"Anybody notice that only women review this album? Take a look for yourself; as you scroll through the pages, you will discover the ratio of women to men is at least 45:1, and the rest of the names are ambiguous and probably women too."
4,Buy this!,"You can tell this was pre-American Idol, but Constatines voice is fabulous! And the songs are terrific! I can't wait for more!"
5,Highly reccomend!........Addicting!,"I love this CD! PFTSOB is a talented group of guys with a unique sound. ""Cry"", ""Drift"", and ""The Day"" are just a few of my favorites off this CD. They have a sassy, yet sexy, sound and I just can't get enough of them. I highly reccomend the CD.....you won't be disappointed!"
2,The singer's good but not the rest of the band,"I've got to say that Maroulis' vocals are excellent on this CD. The problem is I could barely hear him. The bass is way too loud. The guitarrist is ho-hum and the drummer is (barely) so-so.The whole CD feels underproduced; this sounds like the demo CDs bands peddle around to labels in order to get signed, rather than a finished product. It's too bad because some of the songs are not too bad. Had it been professionally recorded with better musicians, ""Suicide"" would have been a great song.My recommendation: Maroulis should get himself a new band. The bass player has got to go."
5,Excellent honest rock... idol or not!!!,"Forget about the fact that Constantine Maroulis was an 'American Idol'. Aside from this fact, this CD really ROCKS! The songs are full of grit, rawness, passion, and honesty, with some excellent guitar riffs! In this day and age of pre-fabricated whiney emo pseudo-punk bands and fabricated no-talent teen pop stars, 'Pray For The Soul Of Betty' is a welcome breath of fresh air. Easily one of the best rock releases of 2005 so far! Get it! I'ts 'the real deal'!To the '3athos' dufus above that gave this no stars and complained that Con doesn't sound anything like he did on 'American Idol', well DUH!!! Firstly, Constantine is a ROCKER. Secondly, his band, 'Pray For The Soul Of Betty' existed BEFORE 'American Idol' for chrissakes! If you had a grain of logic, you would have realized this before mouthing off. This is an EXCELLENT ROCK release! Maybe you expected 'My Funny Valentine' or 'I Think I Love You' by 'The Partridge Family?! Sheesh!"
1,awful,This band just isn't any good. The only reason they have so many fans now is because of mediocre Constantine.
5,My kids loved it!,"I bought this book for my 3 children aged 13,12 and 10. Without exception, they loved it! The eldest is on a second reading of it already, and the youngest - previously a very reluctant reader - is now keen to try more books, now that she enjoyed this one so much! (Which pleases me no end!)She has sent me on a search for more books by this author! I think there is nothing better than to walk past your child while he or she is reading a book and hear them laugh aloud as they enjoy the book. This book generated lots of such laughs! Buy it, you won't regret it, and your kids certainly won't!"
1,HORRIBLE,"Horrible! All the cards came as number ones in the same color green, obviously poor packaging and without directions or a box."
5,Crossfire,I bought these because they are the same size of the balls in the old game Crossfire. They are great replacements.John
5,what you see is what you get x25,"these are pretty cool, i got them for a ""roller coaster"" i am going to make with my 3 year old son, so my technical expectations are pretty relaxed. they're round, ferrous, and shiny... perfect!!"
1,Expensive! We need this great show re-issued on DVD!!,I cannot believe how much this one VHS tape costs. I am hoping that this great show will be re-issued on DVD. I looked around and was able to find fifteen episodes on DVD for less than this one VHS costs.It is a great show but one shouldn't have to pay a fortune for it. Needs to be re-issued as a package on DVD.
2,Such a ridiculous recording!!!,"Caballé screams the high notes. Her voice is very thin in the high tessitura of the role. Her Turandot is subpar; it's ridiculous that her large lyric soprano voice should even attempt to sing a heavy role like Turandot. Callas' Turandot? Don't get me started. Callas is AWFUL as Turandot. Pavarotti is too small voiced for Calàf. Mitchell is a bland, but satisfactory Liù. Chailly's conducting is competent. The sound is very good.Don't be mislead by the sycophantic, hyperbolic statements of a know-nothing Caballé fanatic."
4,Interesting semi romantic mystery,"Well written and has a good story line., and the price was right! It is worth reading. good historical details of India in the period of the British Empire."
2,Not one of his best,"This is fairly typical AEW Mason stuff- tragic heroine, stiff upper lip hero, etc. The writing is often over the top and flowery. Unlike his best stories, there is little suspense or action."
4,LOVE IT,"This CD besides its sensuality has very exquisite mixes of classical songs with such a magestic twist that makes it irresistible not to put them on repeat. Besides the obvious beauty of the cover girl, again Claude Challe presents us a private yet accesible world into french sensuality."
3,Too Longgggggg...,"Susan Wiggs is one of my favorite authors. I have read all of her books, and will continue to do so. This was the third in the story of the De Lacy family. I'm sorry to all of you who loved it, but I found it not nearly as good as her first two novels. I like the two main characters, but there was nothing extra special about them. They almost seemed like second class characters. It took forever to get to the plot of this story. There was no electricity between these two. Oliver and Lark had a magnetic pull to one another from the first time they met. Aiden and Pippa just didn't seem to have that. It was hard to believe they were really in love. I wonder if Susan got a little bored with this story herself. When Pippa ran to Aiden as he was being led to the gallows, I didn't feel that same all consuming love that I did when Lark went to see Oliver in his cell as he was waiting execution. This story had it's ups, but more so, it had it's downs."
5,My God Just Loved It,"Celia the Queen was so good i have always new who she was you new her voice anywhere but i was messing around on YouTube and came across some of her music that she was singing in concert back in the 70's and man i got really hook special when she was singing with the fania all stars they was just so raw! and to see we are all decendents of each other cubans,African americans etc..... The DVD is good for your collection and a good history lesson Celia Cruz is the Queen OF Salsa no doubt-Smile"
2,Freshman English,"The instructions in the book are unclear. The first section states ""the 25 examples listed below are an example of the 90 min. test."" However, the next section is called ""Examination."" What is the ""Examination section used for??? A upper level English course"
2,"right idea, wrong product","I loved this product when I first bought it. Easy to use, pretty accurate, nice features; what's not to like? The problem is, even with gentle care, it soon died irreparably. The crystal display failed, showing only parts of numbers, and the parts that were shown were obviously not correct. Changing the batteries and checking for corrosion or any broken parts didn't help. The manufacturer seems to have vanished.At this price, I'd say buyer beware."
4,I love this scale!!,"This scale is the best thing I have in my kitchen. I just love it. I use it so may times during the day I lose track. I had mine for over 3years. Because it does get so much use, some of the buttons have stopped working. But I will be shopping for a new one. I don't know what I would do without it."
2,missing manual for Weigh of Life,Does anyone know where I could get a manual for this product. I can't find mine. Can't figure out how to use this product without the manual.Thanks.
2,Don't Buy!,"Exactly what R. R. Blair said in his review, I can say exactly the same thing.I bought this scale in March 2007, never using it as a diet scale, only to weigh flour on when I'd bake bread / pizza. Only one who used it. Couple months ago it started to give me trouble by not showing the numbers correctly. Tried to see if it was a battery issue, wasn't. Somehow, it corrected itself and worked until now. Tried to see if it was the batteries again, though I knew they were good, but I was right, it wasn't a battery issue. Can no longer use it as the numbers don't fully show up.Can't find anything on the company, will try the number on the back of the brochure on Monday. Can't say I expect anything to come of it since it's over the warranty period. Only thing I can think may be in my favor is I bought it on a MC and they extend warranties another year.Don't buy this scale, there's a LOT of other good ones out there!"
1,3 month wait go somewhere else,"I ordered this Jan 2, 2007, and the estimated delivery is at the end of March. Don't think so. I will look at other products."
1,who manufactures this product?,"I had no trouble with this scale, until it stopped working complately, 7 months after purchase. Now it refuses to turn on or do anything. I can not return it to the store it came from because 1) it was a gift and 2)i live hundreds of miles away from said store. so i've been trying to contact the manufacturer to cash in on the year-long warranty. i've been calling the tel. number listed in the instruction manual for two months now, with no reply. actually, the message at that number gives no indication that it has anything to do with the scale at all. i have searched on the internet to find the company, ""design manufacture distribution, LLC"" to no avail. Who are these people and how do I contact them???"
1,poor electronics,"I also had a problem with the readout. It worked quite well for about a year, but then the electronic readout stopped working. I never did use the nutrition calculator functions, I just used it for my weight watchers diet. After reading the other reviews, I guess I'll just throw this one out, and try another brand. The only silver lining for me...I bought it in a closeout store for $25."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this scale 2 years ago. Didn't use it too often, but when I went to use it recently, the numbers were all fragmented. I replaced the batteries, but that didn't help. I was reading all the other reviews and saw there were several people with the same issue.I too tried to reach the company and would have been happy to pay for a repair, but was never able to reach anyone. This is a phantom company I guess and they apparently have no concerm about customer service. You are buying at your own risk.In the garbage this will go. It was a total waste of money.Select another brand scale would be my suggestion."
2,Could be better,"This is a good book for buying a Ferrari, it provides details on each model and provides useful insights. However, Ferraris should be seen in color and this book has only black & white pictures. Ferraris deserve to be seen in their brilliant colors and this book's pictures do not do the models justice. I have often said that there should be a law prohibiting publishers from printing black & white pictures of Ferraris and this book is no exception. Most Ferrari enthusiasts interested in buying a Ferrari would gladly pay more for this book to get color pics."
1,Bellini would be rolling!,"While I deeply admire the work of Callas, this set is NOT one for purchase. Caballe has always made a much better NORMA, just buy a copy of her '74 Orange version with Vickers. Even Callas herself sat through a screening of the film, in uncharacteristic silence. When it was over, she simply said, ""You made her look too pretty."" Of course, if you are a die-hard Callas fan, it won't matter to you."
4,Bomba Loiceña,"This cd record the best known bomba groups of the Loíza tradition. The Folkloric Ballet of the Ayala Brothers had been maintaing and cultivating the bomba tradition for 50 years. This cd is an important piece in the collection of puertorican music, specially when with talk about the afro puertorican root."
5,Competing Devotions,"As a woman with a family and a busy career, I appreciated this insightful study of the cultures of career dedication and family devotion among professional women. Mary Blair-Loy is a gifted interviewer and has elicited candid and fascinating stories from her respondents. She is a sociologist who provides a sophisticated analysis of her findings. Yet the writing is always clear, readable, and interesting. I thought about these women's stories long after I had turned the last page."
4,Sofia Loell / Right Up Your Face,"I like 3/4 of the songs, the other 1/4-ehhh. Defenitly contemporary. Listen to preview, she has a mellow tone."
1,Horrible...pop drivel..bad bad bad,"I'm into a lot of ""chick"" music (Nova, Amos, Bush, Martin, Sage, Garbage, curve,Leave's Eyes, dreamside etc...)this album is the worst piece of junk I ever made the mistake of buying; if you like any of the above artists you will HATE this albumpoorly recorded, bad writting and below average vocals"
1,UGH!,"After having finished this novel, I have now read six of Ann Beattie's books -- her first four, written in the late 70s and early 80s, and two recent novels ANOTHER YOU (1995) and this book PICTURING WILL (1989). Clearly something happened during the intervening years. Whereas Beattie's early fiction was full of odd characters, delightful non-sequiters, and brilliant dialogue, PICTURING WILL is dull, dull, dull. The characters are totally bland and whereas a muscular plot might have fleshed them out more, there is no plot to speak of. Beattie looks at the lives of character and explains, explains, explains; she doesn't DRAMATIZE. This tendency not to dramatize was brilliantly exploited in her earlier work, which recreated the ennui and anomie of her characters lives in prose that was razor sharp. PICTURING WILL is filled with none-too-original characters doing nothing much in prose that is lackluster and undistinguished. PICTURING WILL is so bad it makes ANOTHER YOU look distinguished."
1,boring!,"this was required reading for LIT 101, and it was one of the most boring books i have ever read. But if you are looking at this, it probably means it's required for you as well, so you have no choice."
1,Still haven't gotten it..,"Becareful in ordering this product. Who ever is shipping it screws up the order. There must be a database error, because instead of a game, I received soft porn. I contacted Amazon about the order and they were to take care of me by shipping out another copy of the game. Quess what, they sent me the same darn soft porn DVD. I'm ordering it for a schools game club and do you know what it's like to have disapointed kids waiting to play the game. Oh by the way it was opened up at school in front of kids (4-6th grade) - yeah that was not a hallmark event..Save your money and build it out of a sheet of cardboard and use coins for the knights - or you could buy it and maybe get an interesting DVD in the mail."
5,From Cuba with love . . . !,"You can't go wrong with this CD. From her flawless technique, to her heart moving interpretation and her Latin panache the notes just sing off the page with the guitar in her hands. Can't get much better and she's up there with my favorites, David Russell, Ricardo Cobo, Manuel Barrueco, etc. Highly recommended . . . enjoy!"
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"Everyone knows TERK MAKES JUNK, and this multiswitch is no exception. I needed a multiswitch quick, went to Best Buy and paid, get this, $154.00 for this Terk ms!! Yeah, I know, but I needed it asap. ONE WEEK after installation, one of the satellite inputs crapped out, dead. And I do have surge protection on the lines. Also, the unit runs very hot. I've had three other Terk products do the same thing. Avoid Terk at all costs and go with Monster or even Radio Shack in a pinch. Will never buy a Terk product again. Ever."
3,"Works well with DirecTV, but not over the air antenna","I get perfect over the air antenna reception (I'm in line of sight of the towers) but not when I run the antenna feed through this unit. Terk support is very nice but not very helpful for my issue. Just ordered a box of diplexers (found a box of 20 for $40). Out goes the nice neat cable setup... in comes spagetti of cables and diplexers. Also, beware if heat is an issue. This unit runs hot!"
2,Long wait for replacement from Terk/AudioVox,"I brought one of this at the beinging of 2005. I found it was malfunction in Aug 2005. Called Terk, which actually is part of Audiovox, they told me to send it back for replacement. I did send it back in Aug 2005. I have been calling them for status, they told me they out of stock, so that they can not send me the replacement. It is end of November now, they still telling me they don't have stock to replace. They say that they don't really make them, but contact made somewhere. Until they place order for next batch made, they will not have inventory to send me the replacement.I asked them to refund me, so that I can purchase another one from any reseller. They refused to do that, saying they do nothave any way to send any refund. The only choice I have is wait...Another thing I found out is this switch works fine for HDTV off air distribution, but not work for FTA satellite TV signals. It only works for the DirecTV, as it was designed for that only."
5,Cool Cover--Great Read.,"I'm entirely biased because I was at Quincy while Fran was there. Try the other reviews for an objective opinion.Fran, I thoroughly enjoyed it and recalled your discussions of sabotage on the East Coast in WWI.Hope you're doing great!Greg"
2,Buy Ultimate Christmas,The Beach Boys create some great Christmas music. But this is not a real album. It's a budget CD compilation and not from Capitol Records. Buy Ultimate Christmas. You get the original 1964 Christmas album in its entiriety plus GREAT extra tracks from the unreleased 1977 album and others.
1,Not much to it...,"I bought the CD in a shop as an impulse buy (I was somewhat seduced by the corny cover photo). The CD is only about 21 minutes long and, as a previous reviewer says, no liner notes whatsoever. The Beach Boys' harmonic vocals are great, but this is a recent cheapie compilation and I'd say it's a bit of a ripoff. The songs are a mix of rock tunes and traditional Christmas songs. I only found two to be unpalatable: the overly corny arrangement of ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" and the novelty rock tune ""Santa's Beard"". They just weren't my cup of tea. ""Little Saint Nick"" on the other hand is always a fun one."
3,Truncated Version Beach Boys,"This is a truncated version of The Beach Boys standard Christmas Album. Personally I don not think this CD version is worth the money. However, if you can find this album on cassette at a much lesser price it may both worth it to you providing you just want a few Beach Boys songs for your Christmas song collection."
1,Another Mike Love Repackage,"Same old stuff. Half a dozen albums repackaged with a different picture, different title, but same songs. Buy one of the other Christmas Albums."
4,Beach Boys Christmas,Classic Beach Boys sound - loved the selections. A great way to have a soundtrack running while you celebrate the holidays.
2,"Songs are good, album is short","Two stars not dissing the Beach Boys or their music, just the way the album is set up. The album is a 9-track album with no liner notes sold at a cheap price. If you want quantity pass on this. If you don't care for big doses of the Beach Boys Christmas music this may just be the album for you. The Beach Boys Christmas Album is a better value with more music on it."
5,Amusing - kid humor,"This is an amusing book with great kid humor, and a punch line to remember to be yourself. Nice addition to any library for grade level K-3"

2,"Not enthusiastic, but not the author's fault","My mind is more linear that M.C. Richards, so I got less out of it than I might have were I a bit more free. For someone looking for a philosophical treatment of aspects of life learned in the hands of a potter, the book will be a wonderful experience. It was absolutely no fault of the author that I didn't appreciate it more."
5,classic especially good for teachers,I've read this several times since it was first published in the 60's MC Richards has a lot of insight and some very good things to say to teachers.
3,VDC or VAC ? (please correct the ad),"I think this capacitor is 250VAC, but the ad on Amazon says 250VDC .Please confirm which is correct, VAC or VDC .[...]"
3,I'm a 700 Club Member,"I'm a recent born again Christian, and the 700 Club really woke me up that 89 percent of America identifies with a specific denomination, time for Manson wannabes to wake up as well. Patrick Roberston runs the 700 Club now its main chairman to reclaim white people's Christian heritage in America. He's southern Baptist, same as President Busch. I first got out of my juivenile satanic wannabe with the terrorist attacks of 2001, which was by the government of the United States on its own people. If a sizable percentage of the wealthy working class is getting on the satan bandwagon, that spells bad news for the 700 Club, the most dangerous Christian group in America. This is his life story in own words, with my only bitterness being that this is like reading something from Jim or Tammy Fay Baker. They don't want you to watch the 700 Club once you become a member. Once you wake up and become a member, they want it to be a life long thing."
5,Contrary to Pat Robertson's detractors...,"The two reviews above are illustrative of the hate a good number of people in the U.S. have for the Christian faith. Willing to tolerate good little nebishes (if a Christian can be a neb) if they sit on their pews and keep their mouth shut; but woe to those who express a political or social opinion. Most wouldn't recognize the truth even after bitten. Pat does a good job in this book and I'll take his word, his intellect and his integrity over his truth-hater detractors' any day."
1,Not so good,"I have tried three books by this author, and I give up. the overuse of American slang is just aggrevating to read. If he had used more modern Italina slang I could cope. Poor story line, no mystery at all. I am going back to Saylor and Davis for better writing."
2,Yatagan Eau de toilette,"I must admit, of the hundreds of bottles of cologne for men that I have, this one is not one that I like very much. I think it is probably the powerful nature of this cologne which I was shocked at. It is probably the most pungent and strong cologne I have ever smelled. I bought this blind and had never smelled it before which was probably a mistake. I'm sure that for some men, it works, just not for me. Unfortunately, I spent about $40 for the large bottle I bought, and I only used it a couple of times due to it being so very strong. I am going to continue to try it. The key may be to use very little, maybe a spray on your neck or pulse point or chest and then let it dry down well before getting dressed. I would simply recommend that you smell this product before buying it. I have heard good things about Caron colognes and eau de toilette's and I am very interested in trying other scents for men that they offer."
3,Enduring pine,"Makes you smell like you have been living in the woods, sleeping on pine needles and not bathing. Note that if you do in fact live in the woods, sleeping on pine needles and not bathing, then this will probably not do much for you and you are advised to try Le Troisieme Homme instead."
1,"Tried several different brands, this is the least effective","These balls seem to be effective for one medium load of non towel/cotton laundry. Then there seemed to be a buildup of static in the balls and they became ineffective on the second load. After leaving them for a few days I tried them again and they again worked for one medium sized load of laundry. On the third and final time I tried, the towels were completely filled with static.It seems to take a few days for the built up static charge to dissipate and to be truly effective you would need several sets of these balls, which kind of defeats the purpose of the idea in my opinion.I have yet to find an effective version of this idea but I will keep looking, just not at these."
3,Out lasted others purchased,"these dryer balls have out lasted the other dryer balls i purchased. do not get the ones with pink foam circles! the circles fall off. haven't noticed very much decrease in dry time, but clothes are fluffier."
4,works for me,"I've been using this in my dryer for a year and it is working for each load, I usually do five loads on a weekend, and since I stopped using the dryer sheets my sensor on the dryer works much better. I tried the other dryer ball and the spokes tore my sheets and ruined some of my towels, this was much safer."
1,Don't wast your money.,They do very little to help your clothes in the dryer. don't wast your money bying this product it dose not work.
3,help a little,"I used these in combination with the blue Dryer balls, and they did help reduce static (but not completely). I'm hoping they will also function like the dryer balls, to fluff and speed drying time since it's extra balls bouncing around in the dryer. One of my dryer balls broke after a few months (split open) but this has a different design so hopefully shouldn't rip open."
3,An okay book,"This book was okay, but not one of the best. It repeats some of the topics over and over again throughout the book. It recommends two ways of reading the book from cover to cover or by just picking out a chapter here and there. If you were just reading a chapter here and there it is thorough, but when read cover to cover it gets a little repetitive. I would recommend reading it though if you are just starting out with discovering your disease and all that is involved because the book is a fairly easy read and comprehendible."
3,"Not Kweskin's Best, but....","This is not the best work done by Jim Kweskin, but considering what little is available, it gives a good idea of his musical vision. Without his old jug band cohorts, the music doesn't quite swing as in the earlier days. There are some old Vanguard sides that could be rereleased which show a better picture of the former jug band leader."
4,HOT UNDERGROUND HARDCORE,"This is M.O.P.'s first album, which was released in the early 90's. This is one of the best hardcore underground rap album's I ever heard. I've been looking for this cd for a while and couldn't find it anywhere. This cd is filled with blazin tracks and tight beats and I think every real hardcore rap fan will love this album."
3,So-So,"This book had a few mistakes in it, and is very shallow in its coverage of the material. If you're pressed for time then its a good buy, but if you are aiming for a great score, prepare ahead of time and buy a different, more thorough book."
1,A total Rip Off,I thought that the name Princeton Review would guarantee a comprehensive and thorough effort. All other AP Computer Science review books are far superior to this waste of paper.
5,Reading Blaster Ages 6 - 8,My six year old granddaughter loves spelling the words and then getting a piece of the puzzle to put in place. This software holds her attention and helps her with her reading skills.
3,A unique look at lesbians in the law,"Robson is an openly lesbian, politically progressive law professor. (In later articles, she has come out as a cancer victim as well.) This is a collection of her essays on lesbians, homosexuality and the law. This book has a great introduction. Robson is a complex thinker, so do not assume this book will just say, ""Aren't lesbian lawyers cool!?"" Robson's analysis of legal issues can be overly pessimistic at times: as if one domestic partner law or pro-gay legal decision can be criticized for not removing all oppressions throughout the world! Still, this was an interesting read. It differs from many gay legal texts."
4,COULD WE HERE A LITTLE MORE OF JO MAPES,"On one of the tracks, Bob sings a duet with Jo Mapes. She sounded beautiful. Unfortunately, I can't find anything she has recorded.I enjoyed the CD but I wish I could have heard some more of Jo Mapes."
5,Love this book,"This was my first novel that I ever read. The book was given to me from my aunt Betty, that is no longer living. I will always be greatful to her for turning me on to reading. I have read many books & can't remember most of the titles but this one & the sequel Mixed Blessing are forever in my mind. I even remembered that the lead character was named Elizabeth. I bought both books again and plan reading them again but this time I wont' give them away."
4,Remaster is a must have,"Fish-era Marillion was often compared to early, Gabriel-era Genesis. So what?! They also sound like Dave Cousins and The Strawbs. Far from being a copycat band, Marillion took those influences and developed their own musical and lyrical themes. This is an amazing debut...Regarding the REMASTER, it is absolutely essential. The difference between the original CD release and the remaster is night-and-day! The original sounds thin and muddy by comparison. There is so much there that I never heard before - it is truly like hearing the album for the first time. ENJOY!"
4,Terrific debut,"This is really quite a strong debut album. The vocals, lyrics/compositions/arrangements and musicianship are all very good. This was a disc with great promise. The Genesis comparison's seem much less relevant at this point in time (2001). Marillion were certainly unique enough to stand on their own considerable merits. Perhaps not as good as the best of 70's progressive rock but one of the better outfits since. Worth picking up...Simon"
3,Not What I Expected ..,"This is the re-mastered edition of ""The Script for a JestersTears"". I purchased this CD because I lost my original onein a house-fire. Unfortunately, the ""alternate versions"" ofthe Tracks offered are rather disappointing and fall short ofthe true 'Heavy Metal' style which characterised the originalrelease.I especially am disapointed with ""Market Square Heroes"" (bothversions on this disc) which takes out the feeling Fish had putin the original release. If you can find it, get the originalCD and not the new remaster one. The Tracks on the FIRST CD areall the original ones. But the ones on the SECOND CD are ratherdisapointing. It would be better to buy ""B-Sides Themselves"" forthe original tracks on the second CD. ( If this review has helped you please click on the button!)"
3,abatar,"having just been introduced to Marillion recently via ""Misplaced Childhood"" and liking that project pretty well I decided to try another by them and after reading reviews ordered ""Script"". Was dissapointed as the songwriting was extremely simplistic and repetative. A couple of bright spots but overall was not impressed.Sounded more like a garage band trying to play prog.I am a fan of Trevawas with Transatlantic and expected much more from this cd"
4,Early Glory,"Few bands hit the mark with their first album as well as Marillion did with <Script>. The epitome of Fish-era Marillion, it is powerful, passionate and musically adept. The sound developed throughout this first stage of Marillion, through <Fugazi> (good), <Misplaced Childhood> (great) and <Clutching at Straws> (good in parts) but for sheer energy and flourish was never bettered than on this first outing. Sure, they were still occasionally derivative, but wearing its influences on its sleeve doesn't make this any worse an album, in fact in many ways quite the reverse. Incidentally re the previous review, Forgotten Sons is most definitely not about the Falklands, it's about the Troubles in Northern Ireland, which is something more of a touchy political issue on this side of the Atlantic, given the loss of life over the last thirty years. All in all, though, great album!"
4,Solid debut,"Some people say this is the best Marillion album. I disagree. For me, MISPLACED CHILDHOOD fills this position.In SCRIPT FOR A JESTER`S TEARS, Marillion still sounded too much like GENESIS for my taste, but it was obvious since the star that the guys had something special, mainly their singer, Fish (Derek William Dick). This guys sing with passion and it does not sound a fake passion.The tunes are all regular and keyboard driven."
3,Garden Party,"Hey¡¡¡ If you are interested in Misplaced lyrics, you have to buy this album. Great songs and an opportunity to understand it all. Fish sound very strange but New vocalist still singing ""Garden Party"" in the new concerts. Be very careful this is not pop.Music is sublime."
4,Just as she remembers it!,Bought this as a small Valentine's Day gift for my mother (who's quite particular with her perfumes by the way) and she absolutely loved it. She hadn't used it for many many years and instantly recognized the scent. The only other comment was that she remembered the actual color of the perfume (not the bottle) being of a different color. Very pleased overall.
2,Not The Same,I have purchased Fleur De Rocaille 4 times through Amazon and the first 3 were as wonderful as my purchases in Paris (3 times). The 4th purchase from Amazon was nothing like the scent that it was advertised as. I will be very weary of ordering my perfume again through this online company
1,So much alcohoal!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The momento I took the botle out of the box then I knew was not what I knew it should be. Clue guys (yellow fluid). if you want an instant headache, and waste money. ahrrr..."
2,Fleur de Rocaille,"I wore Fleur de Rocaille when I was first married, and then couldn't find it in the stores anymore. I remember it as a light, flowery fragrance. Although the eau de toilette I ordered from Amazon has a slight resemblance to the one I used years ago, it is much stronger and heavier. I was very disappointed."
3,Cheap plastic at a cheap price,I got what I ordered quickly from the vendor. I knew the oscillator was cheaply made and have no regrets as I assumed it might only last the summer. We'll see. If it serves me well through a difficult drought that will be OK. But it isn't a long-lived item.
5,"Fun, informative, and well-written","If, while drinking a pot of Joe, you have ever wondered to yourself ""What the hell is this stuff, and how did it get here?"" then you need to read this wonderfully entertaining book. Incidentally, by ""Joe"" I mean ""coffee."""
4,Eclectic Essays,"This is an excellent collection of mostly short pieces about a variety of subjects. From politics to religion to literature, Rushdie is well informed and opinionated. I found him particularly good on Islam and India. This kind of book is great for the gym or train, since most of the pieces are quite short. Two of the last pieces give his perspective on the fatwa that turned his life upside down after the publication of The Satanic Versus. I was intrigued to see that he regrets delaying the paperback publication version for three years as a concession to the Islamic radicals (I remember waiting for the paperback version so I could see what it was all about)."
4,Slightly strong but good for skin problem,"I used this product on my dog when he had some hot spot. While the shampoo is strong in herbal smell and does not lather as much as other type of shampoo, it does the trick."
5,They Don't Make Movies Like These,"Barbara Stanwyck and William Holden are outstanding in this drama. Also, purchased ""Death of Gunfighter"" with Lena Horne and Richard Widmark.."
4,Involving Story With Good Characters,"This is a good classic movie worth owning on DVD. The main attribute? You care about these people in the movie.On first look, it was a shock at first to see William Holden this young. In this film, he looked about 19 and didn't even have the deep voice I was accustomed to hearing in his movies from the `60s on. However, I've watched this three times and enjoyed it all three times, especially now that it finally came out on DVD in late 2007. No problems with the transfer, either.I didn't recognize Lee J. Cobb, either, who played Holden's father, a Jewish man with a beard. Barbara Stanwyck, meanwhile, played her typical role: tough gal with a soft heart underneath. Yeah, boxing fans might find a few credibility problems but overall, this is a good story and well-acted."
5,Good Music,"The only thing I have to say about this CD is GREAT!! Not only is Vanessa Williams beautiful, but she has a beautiful voice. She's something else!!"
4,TASTICIOUS!,"I usually don't listen to albums like this, but when I heard it,I got all nostalgic for the 70s and was struck by the magnificent vocals & arrangements. Vanessa is all class with no caterwauling and no ""soul screams"". She has real talent whereas pop tarts like BS, MC, etc. just sound like, well, tarts. Beautiful production, very sensuous and romantic. (Would love to hear VW do a bossa nova disc.) Thanks to ""The Grand Empress of Savannah"" for turning me on to this!"
4,A Real Surprise,"I've always admired Vanessa Williams quality of voice and range of style -- I've seen her hold her own with Pavarotti, belt out sexy show tunes, deliver pure solid pop. She truly has a voice with rich qualities, but too often her CDs seem choppy -- too many production styles, no solid direction -- or they use weak songs.What I enjoy about this CD is that while she's covering older songs, she does make them her own, and the production on this CD is consistent. It sets a tone and sticks with it, bringing quality tracks all the way through.This rendition of ""Midnight Blue"", while echoing the original, contains an excellent performance, and, as noted above, ""Let's Love"" is a fun tune as well.I buy few CDs any longer because I usually don't even make it through one listening, much less repeat listens. I've listened to this CD over a half-dozen times in the last four days.I'd still like to hear her do a CD of old time 40s and 50s diva music."
2,An okay album,"Sorry, but I have to disagree with most of the reviewers on this disc. I love Vanessa Williams, and I especially loved her ""Sweetest Days"" album (my favorite of hers), but this one is just okay.I bought this about a year ago, and just got around to opening it and putting it in my disc player for my alarm (I had Luther in there for a long time). I can barely keep my eyes open when this music comes on, because it is so tepid. She has a great voice, but she interjects absolutely no emotion into these songs. It irks me, because it could have been so much better than it is. She picked great songs to cover, but they are songs that need life breathed into them, not songs that should just be song note for note, which is pretty much what is going on here."
4,Frothy yet classy,"Under-rated chanteuse Vanessa Williams tackles the 70s pop-hits from Carole Bayer-Sager's chestnut Midnight Blues to the funky Let's Love from Ohio's Player with subtle charm. Despite the choice of over-familiar covers like With You I'm Born Again and Never Can Say Goodbye, Williams nails the songs with poignancy and honesty. She doesn't strive for vocal acrobatics and instead allows producer Rob Mathes and the simple orchestration from London Symphony to bloom. The best tracks offered includes her comfortable cover of Chaka Khan's Everlasting Love that displays her range, pop-savvy You're Everything, and the saucy Let's Love. It's laudable that Williams remains a charming Valentine and an Original despite the changing times. Fans should welcome her back gladly with this frothy yet classy album."
2,after dinner Kool-Aid Music,"I have always dug Vanessa Williams but nobody has truly done Her vocal range Justice IMO. She can sing&has a nice run of versatility in her,but this album is like drinking Kool-Aid after your dinner&dessert.too much aftertaste.had it been songs that truly fit Her voice&range than it would have been cool,but this doesn't work.Vanessa Williams is still One Sexy Momma&Is very Versatile as a Artist,but she needs something that goes along with what she is being dealt with to work with."
1,No where NEAR the quality of the first book.,"I found nothing in this book that was not in the first. Also, every single house photographed in this book is done in contemporary style, and I am not a fan of contemporary. The first book had a much wider variety of looks and styles.In a nut shell, don't waste your money. Go to your local book store, thumb through it, and put it back on the shelf."
3,Overpriced for what it is...,"Although this book shares some interesting ideas and several spectacular design solutions to severe space constraints, I have two complaints about the format. The first is that you really need to have read the first ""Not So Big House"" book to understand the concepts illustrated here; as such, this book is really a supplement, and, I think, doesn't justify the hefty price tag. Second, many of the houses shown are built by people with, apparently, ample budgets; it would have been nice to see a discussion about how much the projects cost, to give those of us who aren't lawyers or executives an idea of what we can expect before consulting an architect."
4,A Great Supplement,"A terrific book, though only as a supplement to the original, which might be necessary to have around to understand some of the ideas. To that extent it might be considered a bit overpriced. But that aside, the theme of making a lot out of smaller space couldn't be presented better. The illustrations are fabulous and helpful, and while some of the houses appear to have been built with more than a modest budget, the ideas can easily be converted to a smaller monetary scale. A great idea mine for turning your small house into your dream home."
3,The not so big house is more of a Not so inexpensive house,"We have read both books and did find some things interesting, there was only one or two houses in either of the books about the Not So Big House that would have worked for us. One thing we did find that the cost of the ""not so big house""; because of many of the materials used; it is really more than what a number of people might find too expensive for their budget."
2,"Good Idea, But . . .","Her premise that quality beats quantity is a good one. Unfortunately, her taste in architecture (or at least interior design) leaves a lot to be desired -- most of her examples are visually cluttered and will seem dated very quickly, as some indeed already do."
3,Limiting,"The problem with this book and Susanka's first is that the range of styles isn't a range at all. One architectural look runs through her books. I personally found the first NOT SO BIG HOUSE book depressing because the interiors tended to be so dark, woody, grim, and filled with dated furnishings that looked like 1970s rejects. I like the idea behind these books, which is getting away from builder junk and creating a home that has architectural integrity and greater function. The book I highly recommend in that vein is called SMALL HOUSE BIG STYLE, because it shows a true range of home styles and approaches."
1,Bigger than average houses,"These ""not so big houses"" are much larger than the title leads one to expect. The author's 2nd home in Raleigh is 2,300 sq. ft. Not exactly what I was looking for in a book."
2,explains older concepts,"As far as I can see almost all of her ideas are based on the work of Christopher Alexander who wrote ""A Pattern Language"" and ""The Timeless Way of Building"" in the late 70's. I suggest readers look up these titles. They will change the way you look at your environment forever."
2,Not as good as the original,"I bought this book having enjoyed the original Not So Big House, but I found this book to be disappointing - it is very repetitive and doesn't contain any new ideas. All the examples are much in the same style (lots of wood, 1980s style open layouts etc) and the advice is repetitive (lower soffits ...). The look would be very expensive to achieve, and the book doesn't cater for real-life ""not so big"" circumstances, like how to deal with small blocks of land with neighbouring dwellings close by (e.g. terrace houses). The interior design and finishings depicted are also quite dated, neither classic nor contemporary."
1,The okay not-so-big house,"I got this book hoping it would have practical floor plans for fairly small yet functional houses, especially single story houses, but it has no single story designs and to me they are all pretty but also pretty darn big."
3,4-person floor plans,Has some clever ideas but no real breakthroughs on floor plans for a 4-person family. Ideas are more for space saving and storage utilization.
4,Works as expected,Gave me about a 20% signal increase over rabbit ears to an analog TV. Now receive all but one low power station without signal loss.
3,18 dB works,"I bought this at Walmark which is a 18dB model which works wonders for my Comcast cable which were very fuzzy on channel 2 and 4 and a few other channels. It cost $24. Make sure you buy the 18 dB model, I think the lower dB rated here is not as good."
4,It is a little larger than I expected and I got a great price,"I purchased several toys for the toys for tots and I was pleasantly surprised when this toy arrived. I got it for a really great price and it turned out to be a little larger than I thought it was going to be. When it arrived, my 26 year old daughter asked if she could keep it, because it was so cuddly and cute. I'm only sorry I didn't get more. It came in a box and then wrapped in plastic, so I didn't take it out, but it looked like it was about 12 or 15 inches high. I didn't get to feel it, but it felt soft through the plastic. I think it would be a great sleeping companion, as well as play pal, for any child."
2,So-So,"I thought this bear would glow when you pressed on its' tummy or something, like one of those Glow Worms' from the 80's, but no, you actually have to expose it to light and then the paws and tummy glow in the dark. Actually the one good thing I can say about it is, that when exposed to bright light for half a minute it can glow pretty brightly even in a room with some light."
1,"Stick to ""Film Art"" by Bordwell/Thomspon","I was shocked when I looked over this book. I had always relied on ""Film Art"" which is the standanrd intro to film but I wanted to branch out. I found this book to be a superficial approach to cinema, no probbing analysis or challenge to interpretaion of technique or narrative. Save your money and stick to the classics. No one seems to use this book in higher education film studies- ask your professor to suggest a book."
4,as good as it gets,"simply put: this was one of my top 5 cds when it first came out, and it still is. this is about as good as it gets.moody, but never weighted down. light at times, but always substantial. fun and serious. good for dancing and singing at the top of your lungs, or for lazing around on a mopy sunday.Rufus Wainwright (and this Cd of the same name) is an always-welcome guest. actually, he is part of the family. i love rufus and the music he creates. i hope you do too."
4,Heartfelt!,Rufus really digs into my heart with his melodies and lyrics. I too had to get to know Rufus and his work a little before I fell for him and the beauty of the song. I can't wait to hear more from him!
1,Yuck!!,"I was excited after reading a article in some publication that said that Rufus was strongly influenced by Verdi and that entire genre. And so I was curious and bought the Cd and it was a major disapointment!! Not only are the compositions dull and nothing special but, on top of it he sings in the terrible voice which leads me to believe he's tone deaf or just down right annoying. I'm assuming that his PR company are getting paid a hefty heap of $."
4,enchanting,"Rufus Wainwright may not be as angry as some musicians, but his cheerful, mellow, songs are beautiful and utterly unique. If you like this, check out his cover of leonard cohen's ""Hallelujah"" or listen to Jeff Buckley's Grace. Though I like Poses better, this album can still move me - its simplicity is astonishing, but its magnificent nonetheless. Rock on, Wynnewood!"
2,"Strong debut slighted by lack of variety, droning vocals","The opening track is dramatic and wonderfully inventive. The rest of the songs on the CD meld together as one, however, with little variety in Wainwright's melacholic delivery. Why didn't the producers insist on a mix of more musical variation on this CD? If you're looking for a pick-me-up buy the single if it exists; otherwise, pass this one by. I'm off to the used CD store to pawn this one."
2,disappointed...,"it's not bad even though I'm sooooo disappointed with this album. I just dont get people saying his music is sooooo great, but most of his songs in this album are too similar to another... I guess he is good, a good singer and a good pianist, but he is not pushing himself in this debut album as an artist, but I think he will be better... good luck, Rufus.I mean it."
2,What's so special?,"I bought this CD partly because Rolling Stone gave it such rave reviews and named Rufus their New Artist of the Year. I listened to a little bit of ""April Fools"" and I decided to give it a try. I really wish I hadn't. I don't know where all the praise for his voice came from...it's just a forced moan. In fact, it's largely monotone. And the WAY he sings! Is it really necessary to give every word in the lyrics a minimum of 2 beats? This CD may not shoot up the charts because it's loaded with solid, catchy tunes...but it could very well be a long-awaited cure for insomnia. It's not all bad. The string arrangements actually show flashes of brilliance, and he obviously has a gift for writing melodies; however, it's still laborious to make myself listen to every over-emphasized syllabyle of the lyrics. If you like that poppy, Elton John, piano thing, go buy a Ben Folds or New Radicals CD, but if you were condidering Rufus, save your cash."
1,Boo!,"I bought this CD on a whim a few days ago and sixteen seconds into the first cut, I stopped the CD player and promptly marched back to HMV for a full refund. Whan an awful, awful album! Save your money! The man has no range and from what little I heard, grating to my sensitive ears."
3,Gathering dust in my CD collection,"Unique voice and some fabulous lyrics and instrumentals, but after just a couple of listens I got really tired of this CD."
2,I don't get it ..,"Having heard several times of that guy, I just thought I might give his music a try. Well, maybe this is not my type of music, who knows. But after 10 or 15 minutes of listening to his most irritating voice, and to a music that, at best, reminds me of the classic sixties, I just switched it all off. I honestly think this may be good for people who enjoy musicals, but to me, this is just boring. I give it two stars because the pastings on the inner sleeve are great. It should be possible to buy the sleeve without the record."
1,I think I'm going to be sick...,"This is possibly the most puzzling phenomenon of the decade. How is it that this man receives praise for his awful, pretentious whining that is supposed to pass for singing?I saw Rufus perform in Los Angeles last year and was given a free CD sampler of his recordings as a promotion by his label. I listened to his first three songs (which sounded like he was pinching his nose while singing) and proceeded to the nearest trash can. I THREW THAT CD OUT, AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THE SAME!!"
1,Don't believe the critics,"This CD now has the distinction of being the worst I have in my collection. How can anyone give this a good review? If anyone out there wants it, don't order it, I'll send you mine. I would give this zero stars if it were an option."
4,Truly lovely,"It is so wonderful to encounter an artist who can create such beautiful and sly material, then really sing it well....... I also recommend the McGarrigle Hour...delightful (the sister is also a treasure, particularly as cabaret....)"
5,A prize in my cd collection.,"Probably the best CD I have ever listened to. The first time I heard it I actually wanted to cry because I found it so beautiful and moving. either you love it or you hate it...I, my dear, LOVED it! I want to hear more!"
2,Overblown arrangements hiding lack of direction,"Being a huge fan of his father,and a more qualified fan of his mother and aunt,I was really looking forward to this.On the whole,I was greatly disappointed.While I can see what attracted the two of them to each others work,Van Dyke Parks's typically overblown,lush arrangements basically just try to conceal a dire lack of musical direction.The lyrics are inventive and engaging ,but too often the tunes just ramble on and get nowhere.Best tracks are Foolish Love,In My Arms and Matinee Idol,which at least show signs of being real,rounded songs.All in all,a bit of a hothouse flower in need of pruning"
3,Oh well,"I bought this, and it seems to be, musically, like show tunes. The same Uuuup to the note and then Dooowwwn to the heartfelt finish of the phrase. Not to say that's bad, but I expected something a little more ""new"" due to the press and buzz around this person. His voice is monotone, which disguises the structure of these songs and makes them sound more ""different."" Just my opinion."
3,Buy The Mc Garrigle Hour CD instead,"I really like ""Beauty Mark"" on this CD, but the other cuts on it aren't really my cup of tea. The songs that Rufus sings on the ""The Mc Garrigle Hour"" CD, however, are a whole different deal. He has a stunning reedy voice (not to mention his piano playing). But I prefer the structure of a simpler melody line as a vehicle for his voice, as on The Mc Garrigle Hour. On this CD here he breaks up each word with a curvolinear melody shift that for me detracts."
5,"Rufus Wainwright, My Hero!","Ladies and Gentlemen, I strongly suggest you run out and grab this remarkable cd while it still lasts! I myself, am a 16 year old kid, who has until now always been hooked on rock music. But even I have realized that rock is fading for the 90's and rather then rap music jumping up and being the new ""fad"", I would much rather hear more music like this album being played. After hitting play on your cd player it wont take long for you to be hooked by the wonderful lyrics and sounds of Rufus Wainwright. In his debut cd he shows his music diversity from songs like the beatle-esque ""April Fools"" to the brilliant song devoted to the late River Phoenix ""Matinee Idol""...Im not gay, and yes, Wainwright is. So there you see, I'm not letting his sexuality keep me from enjoying this music and if any of you out there do, then shame on you, and its your own loss."
5,God's Gift,"Rufus Wainwright is an unfortunately little-known singer/songwriter with a very strong, very loyal cult following. His debut self-titled debut album is tpyical of what has become Rufus' own genre of sorts. Yes, his own genre, because there is absolutely nothing like Rufus' work. His music is hauntingly original, using varied instruments to acheive a near-perfect range of sound.This album has no profound information regarding a bad childhood, inner-city living, or even the trials of the working man. It is an eclectic assortment of music that reflects the little things of life like love. Rufus' voice exudes the emotion that the listener begins to feel from listening to the elegant lyrics flowing effortlessly from their speakers. This album has been the most enjoyably diverse that I have purchased in 12 months."
5,The best album I have heard in years!,"I loved this album! I listen to it at least twice a day. my favorite song is ""Beauty Mark"". I think he is a genius. I love this album! I agree with MTV, I think he is going to be the next big thing,"
5,Review of Review,"I would bet my pencil sharpener that the ""rise and fall of Rufus Wainwright"" April 4, 1999 review was not written by an enthusiastic fan (read: disinterested third party) but rather by a PR flack (read: corporate impostor). I could be wrong, but I doubt it. What is more surprising is that I never considered customer reviews would be used in such a cynical (and very intelligent) promotional fashion. So much for naivete."
5,"""Boy, I'm such a prince""","Even if this album did not contain ""April Fools,"" the greatest pop song of the last ten years, it would still be a worthy purchase. Wainwright's style harkens back to an age where lyrics were the thing, and flashy production style took a backseat to heartfelt music.What's more, the guy's a blast to listen to. He knows how good he is, and doesn't care if you agree or not. I'm just glad I do."
4,how unique can one man be? i am amazed.,"I first saw Rufus on the Gap commercial (how unoriginal is that) but i was just totally swept off my feet by his amazing voice. I purchased the CD knowing little to nothing about his music and it was such a pleasant suprise. The whole album, even including the more upbeat songs, is so soothing. His voice is mesmerizing as it just flows intricately from one song to the next.i can understand this album couldn't be a chart topper considering what's popular these days, but i hope Rufus can be recognized for his incredible talents. The album is simply heavenly!"
2,overproduction,"""Anything worth doing is worth overdoing."" Incredible melodies are lost in the cacophonous herky jerky, merry-go-round, overproduction. How much more beautiful would ""Foolish Love"" be if it were stripped down so one could actually hear the melody. Instead it is a barrage of eight voice thick harmonies with 3,082 simultaneous countermelodies. ""Beauty Mark"" nearly hits the mark but as soon as a melody one can hold on to emerges rufus rips it from the hands with a drastic time change. Rufus never met a note he wouldn't sing until his face turns blue. A little stacato would help. Most songs take ages to unwind...they are so deeply wrapped up in instrumetation and vocals..that rufus slowly deconstructs them at the end as if to say...""This is all of the stuff that was underneath there...see?"" With such a talent for songwriting! Every note need not be massaged as if it were the last. take it easy next time. Every song doesn't have to be the swansong."
1,What the hell is everybody talking about?,"This is the most over rated album of 98. Its melodramatic sap. He's a male Celine Dion! Get over yourself, Rufus."
2,A Dreary Litany of Sleepy Moans and Groans,"After hearing (and loving) Wainwright's latest effort (Poses), I ran out and bought this CD in the hope that it would reflect an earlier but equally good collection of songs. What a disappointment! With only one exception, this CD is replete with extremely dreary, monotonous, uninspired, sleepy melodies. (When I read some of the other reviews, I can't help but wonder if I listened to the same CD that they're talking about.) Wainwright, whose style and delivery remind me of Peter Allen's, shines when the melodies lift and shift (as they do on most cuts from POSES) to take advantage of his sometimes whiny but unique voice. But on this CD, most of the songs are dark, boring dirges, exacerbated by the singer's morbid droning."
2,By love or sih-ih-ick-ness...,"""Is that a Billy Joel song?"" ""No, I think it's the Partridge Family."" (true conversation)"
3,"A good, solid cable.","It does what it supposed to do. It's solidly constructed, as solid as can be expected from an S-Video cable. One downside is that the slug ends are the typical round construction. I personally like the plugs that are flat on one side so you can easier tell the pin orientation of the plug. This makes connecting the cable to equipment easier and quicker. All in all, it's a good cable, not a great one."
4,Remastered at long last!,"Although sales of the Blues Brothers albums peaked with the motion picture soundtrack, there is no reason to dismiss this album. The core of the hard-workin' all-star Blues Brothers Soul, Rhythm & Blues and Blues Revue are alive and kicking on this album.The only slow spot on this disc is Belishi's rendition of Guilty, but it is done with such passion that it is forgiveable. The highlights of the album are Belushi's version of Do You Love Me by the Contours that rivals the original (with a little James Brown thrown in for good measure), and Paul Schaeffer's masterwork of Booker T's Green Onions, and it feels like Duck Dunn and Steve Cropper never missed a beat in all those years.The album is over all too quickly, and it is with this reluctance that it doesn't deserve a full 5 stars."
2,Not Their Best Album,"""Made in America"" is not one of my favorite Blues Brothers albums. One reason why is that the songs in this CD are not their number one hits. Some of these include the ""Perry Mason Theme,"" ""Riot in Cell Block #9,"" and ""Going Back to Miami."" Besides the bad song list, the CD sounds crystal-clear. If you are looking for a really good Blues Brothers album, I'd suggest the ""Briefcase Full of Blues"" and the ""Blues Brothers Movie Soundtrack."""
5,Wonderful,"After listening to every Blues Brothers cd, I am now in love with them. Every song on this cd is so great, I can't just name one! The Blues Brothers is the band that got me started in Blues in the first place. If you love Blues, you'll love the Blues Brothers."
4,tight shyt,"if u a suave fan but not sure bout thiz 1, u better get it now. dont hesitate. very hard 2 find ins tores, i had 2 ge tmine off tha net, i really suggest gettin thiz 1, got soem great tracks, but if u juz a hip hop fan i dont really suggest it"
1,Little Zen and NO Streetfighting,"This book was a poorly written, pseudo spiritual, account of Mr. Sabat's experinces in Karate training. There were no streetfights of any kind, only accounts of bouts in various dojos around the world, and very verbose descriptions of his training rituals.He is disrespectful of other artists that do not follow his style or reflect his views of ""enlightenment."" I noticed that he made sure the ""Wado Ryu boys"" were thoroughly tired and winded before he ""defended the honor"" of his dojo. He is also disrespectful of professional fighters.He might be a great person, but that is not how he comes accross in the book. I'm sure he trains hard and is a great Sensei, especially if your goal is to heap abuse on yourself.This was a very distasteful book. Save your money."
2,Budo or brutality,"I found this to be a disheartening book. Although the author's descriptions of the intensity he brings to his training (and fighting) are amazing, most of the book represents, to me, the dark side of the martial arts. Sabat's highest view of spirituality seems to be the degree to which he can endure physical privations, that he never loses a sparring match or fight and that he shows no mercy. Although the samurai, his apparent models, are to be respected for their training and fighting intensity and prowess, they serve as poor models for a citizen of the 20th century. Their ethics never rise higher than ""honor,"" expressed in doing only what is good for me or my ""tribe"" (family/clan/nation). Spirituality that doesn't ascend past ""us vs. them"" will only bring us more war and conflict."
2,mostly about his ego not art,"I bought this book awhile ago because I thought it would be a good read, I found out my first insights aren't always right. I like the intensity in his training, but his ego almost took away from the whole book. Sabat makes himself out to be invincable and thats not what the arts are about."
4,like him or not!,"Like him or not Sensei Jack Sabet and his top students are THE REAL DEAL. No kata only three years to Shodan here. I was lucky enough to spend the first year of my training (1984) in the Santa Barbara dojo and it set the standard for all my future training. This book is a must read for any Karate student, those who earn thier ranks with no pain, point sparring and kata will probaly not like it but if your old school, hard style you will re-read it five times.""Embrace the Pain"" Buy it, believe it!"
2,People who don't know Asian languages shouldn't use them,"The Japanese word used on the cover of this book is upside down. In visual punning, turning a character upside-down can indicate the opposite meaning is intended. This was probably just an accident done out of ignorance by the graphic artist who designed the cover."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This book is terrible. Jack Sabat is a sado-masochist. This book details the various ways he tortures himself and his students in training. There are occasional moments where something worthwhile is written. Unfortunately, they are few and far between. Basically Mr. Sabat brags about the pain he has endured and the pain he has inflicted on others. I came to despise him so much that I found myself hoping he would be defeated in the fights he describes. Take my advice and spend your money elsewhere. C.W. Nicol's book Moving Zen is a far better choice."
3,"Interesting, not as bad as some are saying","This book is being TORN UP here on Amazon.Seems like most people have a beef with Jack Sabat's character rather than the book itself.Yeah, he's kind of a macho stereotype. So?Much of his over the top macho battles ring true to my own martial arts experience. I've known many guys this aggressive and ""manly"" to the extreme in several dojos.An interesting read by someone VERY different from me, but I'm not going to claim it's great literature, either. It's a good story with some lessons in determination and fighting spirit.Why didn't those other reviews get it? I have to wonder if they are non-martial artists.Jack, if you read these reviews, don't take those terrible ones too hard!"
4,"An essential text for the ""Modern Black Belt""","While nearly worthless to the beginner student (other than for purposes of an ""interesting read""), Sensei Sabat offers an incredible ammount of insight to the journey and troubles through which all advanced students are forced to travel. For those who have attained the rank of Black Belt and now feel that their training is complete, this book shows that your training never ends, it is only abandoned by those not ready for the task set before them. I hope that those who read ZEN AND THE ART OF STREET FIGHTING will look at the harsh (and often crude) style that the author chooses to write with, and view it as the symbolism that it is. A symbolism that was not meant for a beginner to understand, but for those who would see themselves as ""masters."""
1,i love this album - amazon failing to fix bad mp3s,"I absolutely adore Lullatone and this album is wonderful. However, the mp3 version is un-listenable due to file corruption. I pointed this out to Amazon MP3 a few months ago and they refunded my money for the downloads and said to check in a few days, but the mp3s are still corrupted 3 months later. Just check the preview of track 6 (Morning Coffee) to see what I mean.Amazon has since failed to respond to my further requests to have the mp3's re-ripped. And I don't buy physical media anymore..."
5,Beautiful film that speaks to a trueth,"This film is a 'comeing out' story of a married man that shows his progress from a life of desperite missery and lies to one of courage and honesty--and how this is not an easy road to travel.A small budget film, it is beautifully directed, writen, acted, and filmed. The actors performances so on spot that that you can forget that your watching a 'performance' and start to feel that your watching real events from a fly on the wall perspective."
3,Ok movie but not great,My partner and I enjoyed the movie modestly but it was ok. Not that different from other movies we have seen when an older man with wife and children fully realize that he was always gay form childhood but did not know how to express until later in life. There was not enough to the script or romane between him and the younger guy and nothing really juicy or interesting romance wise. Basically nothing memorable to talk about after seeing it. There should have been more to the plot.
1,Would not handle 135 watt Home Theater load.,"I replaced my Monster Cable HT UPS 1000 which worked perfectly until the non-user replaceable battery died.Brand new, out of the box, I charged the J10-BLK for 24 hrs. Battery 100%.Unit repeatedly shut off when it self-tested battery or operated on battery function alone.Load consisted of LCD TV,Receiver, satellite DVR. APC customer service unable to help. How can a unit rated for 800 watts be unable to handle only 135 ? Thank you, Amazon, for making it easy to return your stuff."
5,Great film and superb extras,"It was great to see this film get the five star treatment it deserves. The deleted scenes, especially the ones for 'overseas' countries are fantastic. The audio commentary is both informative and entertaining.A must have DVD for any fan of 60s cinema and Gregory Peck. Now if only Fox will release Hard Contract (1969) with James Coburn..."
4,Best of Genre,"Gregory Peck was without peer as a convincing actor who always brought something special to every role he played.Here, he was a renowned scientist, pretending to know more about hybrid plant species than he did. This helped him in a role of deception so that he could unlock a secret from an enemy (Red-China) that would neutralize their ability to have an undue and unbelievable influence on third world nations struggling to feed themselves.What Peck's character did not know was that people in his own governmment,(the USA) were not telling him everything about his covert mission and what he did not know could have killed him.An exciting film about a very nervous time in our recent history."
3,Curious Film - Long Unavailable,"I can't think of another thriller where a living world leader was depicted onscreen, not using stock footage like Day of the Jackal or Hennessey, but by an actor. Perhaps that's why this film vanished for decades. (Or that may have been due to the hero's humanist impulses.) In any event, this is still worth watching and the picture looks great on the DVD.The commentary track is the same guys as several of these 60s era thrillers and they do a good job. (Although a fair amount of time is taken up instructing us that Mao was a bad guy.) But they also seem to think the picture's scenes set in China are documentary evidence of the country at the time and not, in fact a Western entertainment's take on it. (As they tell us themselves -- some of this footage was shot in Scotland!)"
1,BAD MOVIE,"Boring movie, lovely packaging and picture quality. Is Gregory Peck trying to imitate Sean Connery?"
4,Very Helpful,This book is really helpful while taking the AP Literature class. It gives some good strategies on how to actually take the test and the practice questions are very similar to what is seen on the test. I definately recommend this book.
4,Cliff Notes,Bought this book for my daughter when she was studying for her AP exam for English. She found the book helpful.
3,"Practise, practise, practise...","There are a lot of things in this book that most musicians know anyway, and a few that woke me up. David Baker expects the reader to really put the hours in. This is not a book filled with licks. It is a book filled with concepts that you apply to your own, or standards, or be-bop. It is a good book, but hard work. there is a lot of work in it if you are the sort or person that can take a concept and run with it. I personally feel that I would benefit most from this book if it was presented in a clinic, or classroom siuation. Many of the ideas need a further development and I'm probably not inclined to knuckle down enough."
1,Editing a cartoon? Gimme a break!,"I'll admit that I haven't purchased this or the other apparantly edited Disney cartoons (for the sake of political correctness) I've read about (such as Melody Time, etc.) according to customer reviews here yet, but despite this, I'm disappointed, but still interested in getting them. However, I still wanted to voice my opinion on this. Like another customer implied, rate them, don't RUIN them! If it's necessary for a Disney movie to have a PG rating because of a few unacceptable things that were perfectly acceptable at the time it was made, what's wrong with that? I've very disappointed at Disney for this... Booooo! Hsssss! Boooo! Both my thumbs are down on this..."
2,"OK for adults, but may not be meant for a 90's 2 year old!","I bought this for my two year old nephew who loves Mickey Mouse & his friends (none of whom do you see much of in this video.) This video may be great for adults who are looking for a blast from the past, but I ended up not giving it to my nephew and regretted buying it at all."
4,Melody Time,The movie was edited and it just lost a little bit of magic. But It was still good to watch.
5,O the music!,"This is old school Disney. It brought back so many good memories. Animation: older but good, Music: love, kiddo should be exposed to music. I was just sitting and smiling. LOVE IT!"
3,Melody Time,"The last of Disney's '40s ""package films"" of 7 shorts. As always w/ these flix, a very mixed bag. The best sequences in them achieve a truly psychedelic frenzy; stringing them together would make for a masterpiece. As it stands, you have to wade thru crap like ""Johnny Appleseed"" & ""Pecos Bill"" to be rewarded w/ Ethel Smith and her way-waaaay-out-there Hammond Organ. ""Bumble Boogie"" is also a real eye-treat. 5/10"
1,Bring Back the Original !,"I'm as disappointed with this issue as some others who thought they were buying the original masterpiece. Okay, so Pecos Bill has a ciggie in his mouth in the original (funny, I never took up smoking because of that, and I was 6 when I saw the original). I doubt that those who see this desecrated version will understand why the original was such a unique experience. It's a little strange to me that Pecos Bill can't smoke and Johnny Appleseed has to clean up his act, but the Power Rangers can violently and noisily wipe out legions of their foes with such glee. Bring back the originals, guys. This, and ""Song of the South"", with Uncle Remus intact."
1,Roy Would NOT be Happy,"we got no further in this DVD than ""Pecos Bill"", after discovering that they cut out part of the song. yes, it's a DVD called ""Melody Time"" and they cut out part of a song! I'd like to know the genius at Disney who thought this would be a good idea. needless the say, this item is being returned to Amazon."
1,I'm so disappointed!,"I too, bought this video because I wanted to own these classic Disney cartoons from my childhood. How disappointing to find that they have become a victim of 'political correctness'. Disney has really lost the plot. I'm not sure I would recommend this video to anyone looking to own a piece of history but I suppose it might have some transient appeal to small children who have never seen the originals. I hope Disney considers re-releasing the original unedited versions of these cartoons (if necessary with a PG rating)for those of us who are capable of censoring our own viewing."
4,Pecos Bill,"It was great fun seeing and hearing Pecos Bill again. About 55 years ago I had a ""book"" with pictures to follow the story of Pecos Bill while listening to 45 records. I had never seen the short movie. I don't remember his cigarette until reading other reviews. The other shorts were fun too."
1,Disney history - not a family entertainment DVD!,"As a product of wartime material, this 'package' film (a number of bits and bobs) was not an ideal format for Disney artists, but it was a way of putting together a feature-length release at a time when wartime shortages and economic pressures made true features impractical. Although made after the war, this is a Disney money-saving effort of that time which is much lesser now. In all honesty it's ironic that something which was once money saving has been turned around by the very same company to become money-making! HOWEVER, I love Disney and would say that those interested in the progression of Disney material would benefit. It wouldn't make a great long-term entertainer for children though."
2,"What's with the editing, Disney?","I bought this video as an anticipated addition to my Disney library. Having viewed it, I admit it's average fare for a 'package film' of its era. However, in reading other comments from viewers, I am very annoyed to know that what I own is a censored 'PC' version of the original film! What a disappointment, especially since it didn't hold my nephews' interest for very long anyway! It concerns me that Disney is starting to censor itself."
2,Edited? No thanks,"I was going to order this, but fortunately I was smart enough to read first. I found it had been edited, so now I'll just watch the clips on Youtube instead, and for FREE too."
3,Why does Disney do it?,"I bought this DVD for ""Pecos Bill"", period.Now, I know the problems purist Disney fans have with the cigarette edited out of Bill's mouth. I agree it's annoying that Disney continues to hack their historic animated shorts to be more ... ""politically"" correct. I think we've ALL had enough(!) of political correctness these days. But that's not why I ask ""why does Disney do it?""In this Melody Time DVD, along with ""Pecos Bill"", there is also the ""Johnny Appleseed"" short. This short is also on Disney's ""American Legends (1958)"" DVD. On the ""American Legends (1958)"" DVD is ""Paul Bunyon"", which is also on the ""Walt Disney Treasures - Disney Rarities - Celebrated Shorts 1920s-1960s"" DVD. That DVD contains ""Morris, the Midget Moose"", which is also on the ""Timeless Tales, Vol. 3"" DVD.What is with the redundancy?"
3,Good product but arrived damaged,"This item was a gift, so I haven't watched the DVD yet. However, it arrived in a damaged case. Luckily I had a spare and was able to repackage it, and so avoided the hassle of returns and exchanges. Nonetheless, I was disappointed."
4,"Dingo Harness Boot, Mahogany","Good quality materials, but I dropped one star for manufacturing quality. There is a small leather insert which covers the heel portion on the inside of the boot. After a few days wear, both came off and I will have to re-glue them."
1,Um.....the author doesn't even know what a Cherokee is!,Simply put....the author doesn't even realize that this book is about a GRAND Cherokee...not a Cherokee. That should clue you in as to how good the book is.
2,Not what I expected,"The large number of practice tests are good, but the majority of the book is useless for helping to pass the test. More than half was advice about CLEP tests in general, and stuff like careers in chemistry. Who cares. The book will be useful to practice on only after I learn chemistry from another book."
3,"Good story, but the truth might be just as good.","As I watched this feature, I assumed that the people and the major events in it are real. So I was a bit puzzled when the interview with Mr. Crowley that's also on the DVD contained no mention of Dr. Stonehill, who is of course the major figure in the story, presented as the Crowleys' inspiration throughout. Now I understand that the irascible Robert Stonehill is only a ""composite"" character, whatever that means in this case, and that the key pharmaceutical companies, and, I suppose, their principals, don't exist either. Maybe they're ""composites,"" too. So who besides the Crowleys are real and who actually did what to make the magic drug available? I'm fairly sure that the Crowley kids got the help they need. But I'm not sure it wasn't obtained from the local pharmacy."
5,You need to see this movie!!,Awesome story!! i love watching movies that are real life. I also have a tremendous respect for medical research. This was a win-win.
5,Extraordinary Movie,"I don't normally take the time to write reviews for anything, but this movie deserves all the praise and admiration that I am about to give.I decided to see this movie because I am a die-hard fan of Keri Russell. Both her and Brendan Fraser show the unconventional love that it takes to be a parent, as they go through extraordinary measures to try and cure their kids. I don't think there could have been a better choice to represent Aileen and John Crowley.This movie will make you smile, cry, ache and appreciate life and appreciate parents and people who will dodge a bullet for you and will put their life in jeopardy to show you how much they care."
4,Brought Me Back to Reality,"Extraordinary Measures is a great movie showing how far someone will go for love. Brendan Fraser, Keri Russell, and Harrison's performances were more than superb. We all wish that we could do more for our loved ones especially with a illness. We are never able to reach the point of making a difference medically in the lives of those who suffer from illnesses. This film shows how ambitious people can be to save others with the hope of a medical breakthrough. It is not a action film or some gushy love story but a true story that had a positive ending. Many people prefer to think of films of this type as boring but reality is reality and we embrace it not shy away from it."
5,Extraordinary Measures,This movie was true to life. Many people have probably experienced the dilemma that this family has had. Harrison Ford is at his best. Brendan Fraser in a very different role for him.
3,measures,"This was an ok flick. I thought Branden did a good job of acting. I thought the character played out by Ford was a bit over-mean, too much of a jerk, so I got the feeling it was over done by him. Storyline was good. Not one I would watch any time soon again, though."
1,"damaged item, no response for refund","It appeared to be an unopened DVD, but with a deep scratch on the surface of the disk, could not be played. I contacted the vendor, but no reply so far. VERY MUCH disappointed :-("
1,Bad Movie!,"This boring flick is a poor rip off of a way superior 1993 movie Lorenzo's Oil with Nick Nolte, Susan Sarandon and Peter Ustinov. If you want to see a riveting account of this true story of a man's relentless search for a cure for his sick son with a rare disease then see Lorenzo's Oil and don't waste your time with this turkey."
4,Kindle Edition,"This is an abridged version of the book; it includes the character profiles of the residents and guests of Bracebridge Hall and the village, but does not include the tales."
2,only for big dogs,You need to have a really big dog or a hay bale to groom for this product. It would rip the guts out of anything smaller.
1,ever get the feeling you've been cheated?,"This is the worst sound quality I have ever heard on a compact disc. It sounds as if they took a tape, of a tape, of a tape, of a tape, of a tape, of a tape, and burned it to disc without putting a dime into re-mastering it. Total garbage! I can't believe how bad the quality of the disc is. What a waste of money! If they cared about their fans, they never would have released this piece of trash."
1,Well...,"Pretty Boy Floyd is ok, and this cd just isn't good, I got this one first, it was ok, but then I got Leathur Boys with Electric Toys and Tonight Belongs to the Young, and all I can say is wow, the sound on this cd does suck bad. It really isn't that good of a cd. Don't Buy it."
4,"Irregular, but VERY GOOD!","THis is the first album by Johnson, released a very long time after it was recorded. As his first album, Eric tried to put a lot of ideas into the same album, and the result is alittle bit irregular. But one can already see clearly his amazing talent, his soft voice, all his qualities. Wonderful journey."
4,"As always, Eric's playing is tasteful and melodic...","His instantly recognizable tone is already defined in 1976. While this album doesn't offer the overwhelming sonic landscape of Venus Isle, its stripped down production let's EJ's playing shine through. I've seen him live a number of times and this album is reminiscent of one of his shows. All in all, highly recommended!"
5,Thank you Kiddie Village!,"My daughter, Alexa, was about three years old when she first watched the music and dance DVDs from Kiddie Village, and she was captivated from the start. She will be four in two months and still watches them. Alexa has never been intrested in the majority of children's movies or other DVDs available on the market, none of which could hold her attention for more than a few minutes. It was such a joy to find Kiddie Village's videos, which are both entertaining and educational. After watching them, Lexi will often put on little shows for me, performing the different dances she has seen, and telling me which musical instruments she is playing. She loves to watch both the dance and music DVDs to this day, and I feel great knowing she is learning so much while being thorougly entertained. Thanks Kiddie Village!"
1,"Big Disappointment- Creepy puppets and no ""fun""","This video scares my 14 month old. I don't see the ""fun"" in any of the segments. It's serious, surreal, disjointed and overall- CREEPY.I would not recommend this video to anyone, and I'm sorry I bought it."
1,Fun With Dance,I bought this for my 2 grandchildren; one is 3 yrs. old and the other is 4 yrs. old. They were BORED STIFF with it within about 5 minutes into it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
3,Pretty Cool little Kit,"These swabs will clean that sensor and the solution is ""oh so good"" but you do only get 4, that's right, four swabs. I had a bad situation over here and I used all 4. They say DON'T reuse the swabs also. Well I didn't but why not move the cleaning material around on the swab tool and use a clean area of the cloth. Might see where I'm going here - the swabs are way over priced but, they are everywhere and a box of 12 are like $13 AND they expect you to only get one use out of each swab. Crazy and I say readjust that swab material and get more like 4 even 5 uses out of each swab. This also gives reason to having a ""kit"" ....why have the entire little zipper kit if you can only use it once or twice? I guess you can buy the high dollar refills and keep it going that way. Just consider using all that swab material you can rather than a little fraction of it. The PEC pads and the eclipse solution are the best thing in town. Love 'em"
5,A good fix-it kit.,"If your digital camera's sensor has dust on it you need the right tools to clean it. So, do your homework and find out what type of cleaning kit your camera requires 1, 2, or type 3 follow the instructions in your owners manual and you will be good to go."
5,Simple and easy,I avoided a $50 charge from the local camera shop to clean my 5D. Took about 10 minutes to get a clean sensor and spot free shots again. And I have enough swabs and cleaner to do it several more times.
4,can't survive the winter without hot chillys,These are great. I cannot survive a New England winter without them. I use them for skiing and just as an extra layer on really cold days
1,Could be longer,"Warm, but too short-- and I have a short torso! Blah blah that was truly all I had to say"
1,Don't buy this book,"This oversized paperback is short on details and long on common knowledge. It's mostly just a few simple discriptions/reviews of stuff you can buy that's not dependant on household current, including solar battery chargers and 12 volt power inverters, which contradicts the title of the book. The best parts of the book was a short discription of how ancient structures in the middle east kept cool (many gravity fed buried masionary air tubes) and the ""secret"" to how certain native tribes dwellings remained confortable during winter and summer (mass/thick walls), but it gave little more info than that and you'd have to build a new house to do either. Very light reading."
1,Incomplete Treatment,"For the amount of money, its just not worth it. First of all, it is not a book about How to Live without Electricity. Its a book about living off the grid. Its not a good treatment of the subject of living off the grid. The batteries they recommend are not what you would want to be using, no mention is made of things like Edison Cells. Its just a poorly put together book in general. There are much better books on this subject."
2,No Knowledge Required,"First all this is a oversized paperback that is available for $8.00 - $12.00. The $31.80 that they want here is either a authors dream price or a mistake. The information aside from being very outdated (1997), is information that is readily available on ""the net"" free. This information is very general with very limited practical on hands use. After reading this book you would have to buy another to actually ""do"" anything. If you were living in a cave then this information may be new and useful to you. Amazon has much better, current books at less cost with much more useful info. The only reason I didn't give it one star is that I didn't ""hate"" it."
5,Excellent Resource,"Quick read - excellent combination of content and enjoyable writing style. Definitely a book you'd want as a resouce on your shelf should the grid go down, or for those wanting to be self sufficient. Add it to your collection, you'll be glad you did."
1,IT IS A MISTAKE TO BUY THAT BOOK !,"First of all, this is not a scientific book. I couldn't find any spesific ""know-how"" that is hard to find. The knowledge in that book is very practical in general, and most people might know them.I don't need to buy a book that offers gas lamps as an alternative illimunation. It's hard to understand that some other readers has given five stars for that book. You can find more searching the internet."
3,wow,"I must continue this read as I know it's good. Many things to remember, names, names, names; I must focus!"
5,war and peace,wonderful. beautiful clear sentences. i cant say enough and i have not finished it yet. treat youself to literary pleasure. you will be blown away.
1,Who translated this please!,I would like to have a well translated edition of War & Peace. Other Kindle editions disclose one way or another who performed the translation. After downloading the sample I am still in the dark. It would be a kindness if Kindle always identified the translator of books from languages other thanEnglish.
5,I got this in a bundle,"If you have the time this is a great novel and has a great deal of war, love and history all in one book! Love it!"
3,yes more freebie,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
2,Ok but not my idea of a good read,I got this on a whim but find it was not interesting enough to keep me into it. I did not like it very much at all.
4,war and peace,"very long but interesting reading, would recommend to others who enjoy reading and working at a novel. A free offer at Amazon"
1,Not as advertised,I was totally disenchanted when the book came in the mail because it is an abridged version. If I am going to take the time to read the longest novel in history I want it to be the real thing. It was a total waste of money because I am never going to read it.
1,Not Briggs,This is not the Anthony Briggs translation as advertised. It's freem but if you're looking for the Briggs translation this isn't it.
1,Wish I could but I am Canadian,I so very much would love to review this Kindle book...but seems if you are Canadian as I am... we are not allowed to buy this one or evenget it for free..... Thanks
1,War and Peace (Abridged 4 CDs),"The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition."
1,War and Peace,I read this book from cover to cover and absolutely hated it. It is dry and bland. I do not recommend it to anyone.
1,I HATE This Book,By Peyton MowerI read this book when I was eleven because my mom said that it was really long and I wanted to challenge myself. I didn`t even know what was happening most of the book. This will be a long one if you read it.
5,Magnificent! An All-time classic of Historical Fiction,"This novel is probably the best historical fiction I have ever read. The translation is well done, and this story is powerful. I especially like the story surrounding the Bolkonskis and the Rostovs.The scene where Napoleon enters Paris is priceless, as well as the details of the battles of Austerlitz and Borodino. If you want to know what was going on in the world during the Napoleonic era, then this is the book you must read.Maybe Michael Shaara's Killer Angels is on par with this great piece of writing."
5,"Super color, nice option instead of typical blues and whites","Quality item, Parts Express is an old company so buying from them is a sure bet, they have been selling long before Amazon even, and have lots of great project parts! LED has a great violet color, nice to have something other than another blue version. Beam pattern a little tight but not that much, though plenty of light also coming out sides as well. For even more lightly sand off the top a little or use a drill to cut a facet into the end and make it spread even more (you don't need to drill down far, just enough to make the leading edges of the drill make a pass in)."
3,Easy to figure out the villain,"Not the worst one I've seen, but not one of the best either. It was too easy to figure out who the supposed other ""Grimm"" was. And I found it odd that the first Wesen they brought in was so vocal about Nick being out to get him. I thought they didn't want to be identified.Also I'm getting a little tired of Juliette. If this woman really loved Nick she wouldn't have accused him of being crazy at the end of Season 1. Nick deserves someone better."
5,LOVED IT!!!,"Great show. Very entertaining! We loved it! Glad we found it. Totally missed it when it previewed, but we're caught up now. Give it a try."
5,Just Great all together,"Love this show so much. Its Exciting, mystical, fun. funny and grimm... hahaha And you cant help but love Monroe"
4,I like!,"I enjoy the Grimm series. It is too scary to watch in my home with my 2 year old. So I watch them on my Kindle Fire on the train. On more than a few occassions, I have nearly jumped out of my skin while watching an episode (much to the dismmay of my fellow commuters.) The characters are developed but, my one question why doesn't Nick recognize Captain Renard for what/who he is?"
4,A great series that gets better over time. Give it a try!,"I like Grimm. It is a very interesting concept and a quality series. I have to say that I do not like the CGI effects, but the series is so cool it bothers me less and less. I think a mix of mostly practical effects with CGI enhancements would be perfect.The best part of the series is that it was already very good and original and is improving as it goes along. Season two already stands out. So many series crumble as they progress that I am very happy to see this one getting better. I hope it goes on for a very long time (as long as they keep the quality up)."
4,"If you like Grimm, you'll like this episode too","If you like Grimm, you'll like this episode too. The storyline moves along nicely with several different plotlines progressing concurrently."
3,Don't make me start watching once upon a time!,"This storyline is getting on my nerves! What is taking so long for her to remember Nick? I really don't like Juliette anyway so having her character with anybody but Nick is stupid! I say keep her with Nick, accepting his gift, and becoming a doctor to the so called inner beast people. Now that would be perfect! If something don't happen soon I am going to have to start watch once upon a time! LOL"
3,sandmansays,"I did not watch Grimm in it's first season, But i saw an episode and found it to be interesting. I think that most people will find the show to be joyable."
5,bottled fun,Another fine episode in this hit shows second season. The show remains a outstanding horror fest with strong characters and good effects. This episode features another good story line about the vesson and their various actions. I haven't seen a bad episode yet of this one and this has beat the odds because most horror shows fail on tv.
5,Sleeping Beauty awakes with a kiss,"Captain Sean Renard is not happy that Adalind has poisoned Juliette. He goes to her mother Catherine (Jessica Tuck/True Blood's Nan) to get whatever potion is necessary to save Juliette. Unfortunately, it is much more complicated than that. Juliette must be kissed by someone pure of heart, and that requires Renard drinking a potion to become pure. While Monroe and Rosalee and Catherine are each working on their own potions, Nick and his mother (The Woman in Black) catch up on their Grimm history and fight the Mauvais Dentes. Renard's kiss awakens Juliette and momma Grimm leaves with the Coins of Zakynthos, vowing to destroy them before the royal families find them and collapse the world politically and socio-economically as we know it."
4,"I love this series, but you can't hit a home run every time.","This one was okay, but we need a little quicker exposition of what the Captain's scheme is, and the evil wessin from abroad is quickly becoming formulaic. I love the concept of the series and I love the acting and character development. I'd like to see Bud the eisbiber and friends come around again. Mix it up a little and see if we can't follow up on a few of the guest wessin from the first season. Just a thought."
4,Resumption from the cliff hanger,"I like the Grimm series (I discovered it well into the first season and had to play catch up), despite its occasional discontinuities and plot gaps. I watched the entire first season and developed a liking and interest in the main characters. The plots are sometimes (OK, most times) predictable but the cinematography is good, the Oregon woods lovely and the reinvention of fairy tale characters as explainable variations on the human genome interesting. I will no doubt continue to watch the series to its conclusion."
4,I like it,Very well done nmfnjsi9kcf kimv dflolmd xk voio doo vn kiimxkn vodocovmomxo doooslosopoppdopov doodooosd c xodcvndinvdnizndincvj xkcnkin i Know it
5,Fantastic!,"Our hero, Nick, with the help of Monroe (a reformed wesen) & briefly Nick's mother, is growing into his family's line of reasponsibility as a Grimm. Hank, his police partner, is freaking out because he doesn't know what to make of what he has seen. Juliette, his lover and friend, was attacked by an angry, vengeful wesen and after being in a coma for three days, remembers everyone around her except Nick. The captain is able to hide his wesen side, perhaps due to being a royal. This is a wonderful show, at times side-spitting and at others terrifying. These are the ""true"" stories written by the Brothers Grimm. I strongly encourage those of you who love this genre, as well as those who might, to watch Fridays on NBC 8PM central, and 9PM East and West Coast time. Amazon also provides you the joy of owning last year and this year for reasonable prices. WATCH and fall in love."
4,"Bad Teeth, Better Grimm","The second season opener was a pretty solid continuation of the tension and action created by last season's conclusion. The pieces are set across the board, people are unraveling, the Wesen become more hardcore (as does Nick himself), and Monroe continues to be the best character on the show. My main complaint about this episode is that the opening quote is from ""The Second Coming"" by William Butler Yeats and is not a Brothers Grimm quote -- they didn't appear to provide an attribution, which is bad form. By the way, Nick's [spoiler]? Creepy lady."
4,Grimm isn't Grim,Much more exciting and fast paced this year. Someone has taken the time to edit this excellent show and show how good the stories can be. Bette H.Amazon Verified Purchase
4,Great Show,"Love the Show, would have given 5 stars, but the video was a bit choppy.Hope this stays on for a while."
3,Over-Priced,Bought Season One and loved it. Have watched Season Two and planned on buying it but when I saw they had doubled the price I changed my mind!
5,Grimm season 2,Great show...totally love Monroe. He is soooo funny and the storylines are great! Nice to be able to watch anytime.
2,From Fame to Mundane!!!,"This is a great television show; however, the show is now treading the waters of typical, expected, and mundane. Get on with it already and move on. You can build on a plot only sooooooooooo loooooooooong and it gets tedious and boring. Everyone is now in on the secret so lets move on to stronger harder to get rid of creatures and let some of the political background of the characters get taken care of. The plot is not thickening, it is becoming boring and tedious, and this great show with such potential will be cancelled. :("
5,Worth watching,Awesome! A good addition to season one. Just wish they did not change the intro to the show. But still love.
4,"Not the best episode, but still good","I love this show, and Monroe is one of my favorite characters so I enjoy any episode in which he appears for a good bit of the show. My only problem with this one is Juliette. It seems like they can't decide what to do with her. I wish they would hurry up and solve her memory loss, as it doesn't seem to add to the story line."
1,amazing,"...collection of appallingly bad poems one wonders how they were accepted in the first place and why the reader (this reader anyway) was left feeling so disappointed, so let down to the degree i will never buy let alone bother reading franz wright's 'work' again. best to spend money on another poet and give this one a wide berth."
5,The best!!!,This is the best and Scott is soooooo fine!!! I really think that they r better then backsreet and NSYNC and that they should come to America more. I LOVE U SCOTT!!!!!!!!LOVE HEATHER
5,A totally smashin Video,If ya wanna know more bout the lads...this is the video to watch..it has loads of great songs and the lads tells ya a bit about em selves...so if ya don't have a copy of this fab vid...go get one...whatch waitin for..??
1,what a loss,with all these 5 star reviews you would think it would have been great. but it was a big disappointment.
5,The best video I ever saw!,"I think this is the best video ever! It has lots of video's, interviews, and other cool clips. I recommend that you buy this video. Abs looks so cute in all the vidoe's!"
5,So comfortable...,"This is the second pair of Speedo Hydroterra thongs that I bought. These are so unbelievably comfortable. They're great for all day, long walks. I wore these to Disneyland and Sea World, both parks with lots and lots of walking. My feet weren't sore, and neither were my back or joints. Love these, that's why I bought a second pair."
2,Not a beginners book,"If you are like me and do not know the difference between a dodo and a dado, then this is not a book for u.1) Poor organization of material2) No coverage of basic concepts ( and I mean basic)3) Poor and confusing drawings"
2,confusing,"Not a book for beginners, since it is extremely confusing and poorly organized. You have to deeply study the book in order to get any benefit as opposed to reading it. The presentation and the drawings are all jumbled up and hard to follow. NOT WORTH IT"
2,Just OK,"First of all, if you are working on a beginner-type table saw, this book will be pretty useless to you. The book centers around a number of jigs that work with standard sized table saw slots - so your entry level Sears bench saw will exclude you from most of the fun. You need a decent [$$] contractors saw or better.There are some amazing things that can be done with a table saw as is demonstrated by Mr. Tolpin but as others have pointed out you need to STUDY the book. I've looked at some of the jig diagrams multiple times and still haven't figured them out. If you don't have good solid basics under your belt, look elsewhere. I give it two stars for presenting some very original ideas."
4,Only if it were magic....,"This book covers quite a lot from setting up the table saw to making jigs that make cutting wood a breeze. It also covers selecting the right blade to use for ripping, crosscut and plywood. He also suggest what type of table saw to buy depending upon the space you have. It is a good reference to have in your library."
5,Read this book before you buy a table saw,Excellent book that starts with a description of what to look for in the selection of a table saw and blades/accessories. I thought it did a better job of explaining how to care for and maintain a table saw than did my owner's manual - I have probably saved the price of the book in saw blade resharpening already. Thouroughly covers basic and advanced table saw cuts and how to do them safely. Describes a number of jigs based on his design of a rip-fence accessory attachment and makes complex cuts and joinery look easy. I'll soon be throwing away some of my more awkward mitre-slot jigs.
2,Ok but not very detailed,"This book is a more a of brief review of table saw technique and jigs. The chapters are not very detailed and don't actually contain any directions for doing most of the cuts or processes. The most frustrating thing is where he will say ""just use this very handy jig"" and then gives a very crude drawing of the jig with no explanation of how to build it or even a basic layout. A MUCH better book is Kelly Mehler's The Table Saw Book."
4,"Good book, but not everyone is in it","This is a very good book about kali and Filipino martial arts. I wish that there would have been chapters on Villebrille, John LaCosta, and Tuhon Leo Gaje, three of the main Filipino M.A. greats. Maybe in the next edition."
4,Loved it!,"Good movie, reasonably good acting, great sound and great picture quality (HDDVD version). The depth charge scenes really are a joy for those with a good quality surround sound system and sub in particular!! (although your neighbours may not agree). Some say the DTS track is better than the Dolby Digital+ track, so you may want to check out both."
4,it didn't sink,"U-571 is a great American film that is taken too seriously. Many people over look it because of the ""historical errors"" in it. Nobody seems to be able to look past the factuality of it. The way I viewed this film is without caring or taken too deep into thought of the historical background on the film.Everything was terrific about U-571, except for the pacing in the beginning. The first half of the movie set it all up, but it took too long at times getting to the action. Sure, the plot was important, but I just feel it dragged a bit at times.The acting was fantastic. Everyone in it did a great job. I thought McConaughey had the best performance of his career. Jonathan Mostow had a fantastic effort with the directing.And what can you say about the special effects? They were awesome. Everything looked very realistic.U-571 is a great addition to the war genre. 5 Stars"
2,OK,"This movie is OK. It is not a good movie nor a bad movie. I enjoyed watching the crews interact and live in the unusual environment which a submarine provides. However, the story contains much of the trite content that has been used several times in war movies. You can take it or leave it."
2,The Script is the Problem ...,"Pros:The picture and audio quality was superb.Great special effects.Cons:I thought the script was terrible. This WW2 sub film had all the typical ""sub"" plots like running silent, taking it deeper, engineers fixing leaks, and sending up an oil slick and debris field including a dead body. The unusual twists were utterly unbelievable.Recommend U571 for a Net Flix rental and buy something else."
5,Many improvements,"Many improvements.The side menu is faster compared to other HD DVD's. For the first time I can appreciate the ocean waves without pixels, the scenes under water are well transfered that barely can notice the faded colors between the clear and dark colors. Torpedos, deep charge bombs now has better details."
3,Great but American movie,I recommend the collector's edition of U-571 for anyone with a good home theatre system (or anyone who enjoys a great suspense yarn in a wartime setting). You feel right inside the stricken sub as it sits quietly underwater trying to evade the destroyers - the ping.....ping of the sonar runs around your speakers and mixes in with the sound of rivets creaking under pressure.An excellent follow on movie to U571 is the brilliant Enigma (about the way the Allies broke the U-boat code).
2,Disappointing effort,"U-571 is a shallow rip-off of ""Das Boot"". The characters are not well developed, and the obvious references to ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" (personality clash between CO and XO, and the ""dive! dive!"" scene) don't come off. The theatre trailers suggested to us that the American crew in the German sub (which ran pretty well and looked amazingly ship-shape inside for having been all shot up in the seizure of the Engima) had to get through Allied combatants to get back to safety. Overall, a very disappointing treatment of an interesting premise."
1,Unrealistic try of depicting WW2 special submarine operation,"Regardless of the well known fact that Americans are always lucky in whatever they do (e.g. not one single torpedo dud in the whole film), we are again shown why the Germans lost the war. There are way too many scenes in which lucky fortune counts for the film heroes and again the always incapable Germans. The atmosphere in ""Das Boot"" (1981) is much more intense. My vote is 1 out of 5."
1,U-57...1 star!,"I REALLY didn't like this movie! It was about 30 minutes too long for what it had to offer. And besides it's special effects and talented cast that isn't much. I not only dislike it for the fact that it is boring, but it is not historically accurate which has hurt some other recent films like The Patriot and Perfect Storm. For better submarine films, check out The Hunt for Red October or Crimson Tide. For U-571, wait for cable or just skip it altogher. Not worth the time."
1,Let's rewrite history...,"News is that a film is in development in the UK about that period of 3 days in August 1945 when the RAF dropped two A-bombs on Japan, thus ending the war.As it is fiction and ""Only a Movie"" it is thought that Americans won't find too much to dissent about, especially as proper recognition will be made right at the very end of the movie, in small print, just before the credits."
3,"Good action, but FAKE","The movie is fake and unrealistic. Sub's couldn't fire underwater at each other. Firing a few Torpedo's at the front BOW of a destoryer is the hardest shot to make, and unlikely to be made by these goofballs. They also couldn't just jump in a German submarine and know how to use it just like that. What a insult to German U-Boat veterans. German's are the best Submariners in the world. By 1943 the German's didn't really have any Destroyers left, there navy was pretty much destroyed besides the hundreds of U-boats. This could have been a great realistic WW2 movie but blew it because of ""Hollyweird"". About as lame as the new ""Pearl Harbor"" movie."
3,so many heroes,"Looks like a B-Version of ""Das Boot"" mixed with old-fashioned ""we-are-the-heroes-the-others-are-criminals"" patriotism mixed with ""one-shot-from-us-kills-10, but we are invincible and keep on fighting even after being shot"". The director seems to have seen to much B-Westerns from the 50s. Nevertheless worth to be looked at if propaganda and patriotism is your favourite subject or simply if you are interested in action movies without regards to the plot."
3,U-571,"Overall, I found U-571 enjoyable, especially the depth charging scene! I actually felt a bit claustrophobic and trapped as the charges came closer and became louder!There were definitely some discrepancies, but overall, not a bad movie to sit back and enjoy.Michael Dyckman, the reason the chief reported to the Lieutenant is that the rank of chief (multiple levels) is an enlisted rank whereas the rank of lieutenant (again, multiple levels)is an officer rank. By the way Michael, enjoyed your review of U-571."
4,One of the best of its kind.,"I am anxiously awaiting the DVD release of the relentlessly suspenseful WWII Submarine Adventure, U-571. I saw this film in theaters, and have since decided that it is one of the greatest adventure films of recent years. The performances are exeptional and loyal to their era. The charcters are multi-dimensional, and the suspense is nearly unbearable.Sound plays an unusually key role in the full enjoyment of this movie, and the DVD release of this film should prove a worthy addition to the collection of Dolby Digital enthusiaists. The scenes involving the depth-charges in particular rely heavily on the use of rear speakers for full dramatic effect, and with the a good sound system, should improve the intensity of these nail-biting moments tenfold."
2,hear me out a quick sec,"I mean it really is, there's nothing else you can say. Am I right? I mean, am I right on this one? Is this movie a joke or what? Forget about the fact that the Yanks weren't even in the war yet, and forget about the fact that duh seven men cannot operate a submarine, and oh yeah forget about the sub (pun intended) par acting, and don't forget to forget about the fact that for real every single thing about this movie is fake, forget about all of that and just think about this for a sec: they did all of that in the old sub and then without confirming any kind of rendezvous with a friendly vessel they abandon ship into the open sea. Can you please forget about all that other stuff and just explain that to me for a quick sec?"
1,Messing with History,"Sorry, I just can't enjoy a film that messes with history to the extent that this title does. The mission in the film was nothing to do with the US - those were BRITISH sailors risking their lives to capture the coding machine, some years before America even joined WW2!As a Brit myself, I find this re-writing of history to be in extreme bad taste! I mean, what if we Brits released a film portraying the moon landings as a British mission, with a Brit playing Neil Armstrong! You get my point, I'm sure."
3,Outrageous Americanism!,"This is an okay film as cliched action films go, but from the opinion of an Englishman, it is really really annoying that you Americans have made this film, about a US sub stealing a German Enigma machine. This is a true story, except for one thing. It was a British sub which stole the enigma machine in WWII, not an American sub."
3,Huh? Haven't I heard this before?,"I cannot believe someone would make such an excellent film about a 'fictional' US submarine event when this actually took place during WW2 involving a British submarine. I think the recent Hollywood war films have been fantastic, but little or nothing is ever mentioned about the British war effort especially in this film which I think is a slight insult to the British servicemen who actually captured the Enigma machine from the Germans. Still an outstanding flick with some convincing special effects."
4,Movie review,Matthew McConnehey was good in this movie. It was suspenseful and well done. I would recommend this movie to others.
2,THE BRITISH CAPTURED THE ENIGMA MACHINE,"That's right - don't be fooled by this revisionist film that lifts a few scenes straight out of the vastly superior ""Das Boot"". I hate movies that decide to make history fit their stupid plots, and ""U-571"" is no exception. No Americans were involved in the seizure of the enigma code, and this movie will only serve to misinform many people. Aside from that, this is a decent action movie that steals from all submarine movies to preceed it. Also of note: Jon Bon Jovi's cameo is very funny."
2,"very, very average...","If your looking to be entertained by action and suspense, U571 is up your ally. But for those of us who demand more from a war film, this work sadly will come across as an American ripp-off of Das Boot, especially intended for audiences that are not familiar with the latter masterpiece."
1,Disrespectful,"In my opinion, the film disrespects the REAL man and women involved. USA love to change history to please its own people even its its to change heros and make them American. Ok alot of British have complained about the facts but concider this: if a worldwide release of a historical movie was made making George Washington an evil man or having japanese play the roles of the men that landed on the moon giving pride to be japanese or events at pearl harbour being british and not american. Do you think you would like it? enough said!I am American and love History but find it upsetting when hollywood makes films but dosent give the credit to anyone other that the Americans. Americans helped alot in WWII but actually it was the joint efforts of most nations hench it was called world war?!? the unsung heros are actually the russians, they fought the nazi hard,if they didnt fight the nazis we'd be screwed, the enemy of your enemy is your friend."
2,Mr Jennings film reveiw,"This movie is about an American raid on a German U-boat to gain possesion of the enigma code machine. As with all American blockbusters the Americans were depicted as the clean-cut, good looking 'nice guys' and the Germans were shown as the scruffy in-breeds. I am sick of these movies, therefore U-571 did not go down very well. There is also a few historically incorrect pieces of information displayed in this movie.1. The Americans were not involved in war during this time. 2. The British were the ones that captured the enigma machine.Overall. i did not really enjoy this movie as it was hard to follow, boring, historically incorrect and American.PS. Do not see tomb raider........big waste of time."
2,U-571; History or Mystery,"The film U-571 is as entertaining and captivating as any other product of hollywood. But when look at from a historical point of view, its inaccuracies and misrepresentations are sky high. Not two minutes of the film can pass without sign of hollywoods ignorance of the events that took place in the race to capture the enigma code machine. Even someone with little historical knowledge can identify innacurracies through nothing more than common sense. It is shocking that the writer and director of the film can portray the events with such imprecise detail and show such disrespect to the men who lost their lives in these events of WWI. This film would be good if more historical research was attempted. I rate it 4 out of ten."
1,spitting on the graves of the RNs war dead,"This travesty of a film really takes the biscuit.Despite what many US reviewers say, films like this form attitudes and opinions in their viewers.Thanks to U-571 many people now believe that the USN secured an enigma machine and saved the free world from Nazism. What rubbish!!!!!The RN captured the machines, and we had to tell the USN how to run its anti u-boat campaign.Make a film about that.When you take your history and distort it, like in the patriot you just make yourselves look stupid.When you steal someone elses glory you just look like you are desperate for the world to look up to you.The Yanks CAN make really good war films- The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down were all superb, this disgusting rubbish should be scrapped."
5,"""A Better U-Boat Story""","I thought this was an excellent film about a group of navy men who board a German U-boat during World War II in order to steal an Enigma code machine. It's non-stop action and thrills from the start. No, it doesn't compare to ""Das Boots"" perhaps the best sub movie ever made, but who cares. This movie on it's own is well worth the watch and truly entertains. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours and experience what it was really like on these U-boats during the war. The special effects are amazing, the camera work is outstanding, and the feelings and emotions are very realistic as portrayed by Matthew McConaughey, and Bill Paxton. I also thought Jon Bon Jovi did a wonderful job, ( a very natural actor) although his part was short in this film.There are many extra's on this DVD that shouldn't be missed. Make sure you find time to watch how the special effects were done. An excellent movie to add to your collection, to watch over and over again."
5,inside the trilogy...great sound,"This movie have an excellent place if you own ""das Boot"" and the ""search for red october."" Then you have the 3 submarines movies to own. Das Boot is surely supérior and remains the référence..but U 571 has a fantastic sound with a lot of spécial effects that das boot don't have...mainly if you listen to it in DTS... this is an excellent dvd to own in your collection of submarines movies"
1,Complete Garbage,"This movie was based on the capture of a U - boat during WWII by the Royal Navy who recovered its Enigma machine and prevented the crew informing the Kriegsmarine (Nazi navy) HQ.As well as historical inaccuracy the acting is hopeless and the sub - plots totally unbelievable. There is more realism in a Disney cartoon.Watch ""Das Boot"" instead and get a copy of ""The Cruel Sea"" (1952) starring Jack Hawkins, Denholm Elliot and Viginia McKenna if you want to see exciting, realistic submarine warfare from above and below the waves."
5,A great WWII naval film!,"If you're a fan of war film's, action and suspense, U-571 is what you're looking for! While this film is not much as far as the historical value, who care's. This film does exactly what everybody involved with it set out to do, entertain. It has a clearly defined plot line and carries through with it in a splendid manner. The depth charge scene was particularly explosive (no pun intended, yea right). Matthew McConaughey does a wonderful job in this film. Starting off as the efficient officer that's not quite ready for command and then transforming, due to circumstances, into a battle hardened leader of sailors. Overall I would recommend to this film to anybody! The special features included on this DVD are exceptional as well."
3,Good....,"This fictional account of how the allies seized the ""Enigma"" coding device (a historically accurate NAZI coding system) is worth the watch.Of course, it could be a little boring considering it occurs inside of submarines... no windows... no amazing scenery.... but the essence of the struggle is well preserved.Give it go.... or at least a rental."
3,Old Fashioned Hollywood Submarine Action Move,"U-571 is a throwback to the good old fashioned days of the Hollywood W.W.II submarine genre. U-571 has a very implausible plot but it still remains to be extremely entertaining through its execution of action and suspense. My only real complaint is that the film gives credit to the theatrically heroic Americans for recovering a German Enigma machine for decoding orders sent to their submarines. This was something that the British had actually accomplished and should be given credit for. The United States did not recover an Enigma machine till near the end of the war. That being said, a real highlight of this DVD is the incredible surround sound. Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel and David Keith all give credible performances."
3,Entertaining but biased.,"I think a European's opinion is needed here. While the film is rather entertaining, it's a complete piece of Hollywood fantasy and is selling Americans as doing things they never did! The British actually got hold of the device by the way! I have no problem with Hollywood indulging in fantasies. But younger audiences are going to believe films like this as being ""fact"" and THAT'S really sad!"
1,Can people actually talk about this as a good movie?,"basically this is a movie about a bunker in the deep, never before (and hopefully after) has an u-boat been seen that could take more hits from deepwater bombs and continius sailing on.. not to mention the rear nuke they carry around.. one shot of that one could have killed anything. this has to be the worst u-boat movie ever made.. If its the first u-boat movie you ever see it might hold a suprise or two, but otherwise you will easily be able to see what is going to happen the next 10 mins as the movie progresses."
2,Rewriting history once again!,"This movie just whipes its nose on the pages of history, it was not americans who captured the secret germnan code machine, it was the British,that little point aside the movie had some redeeming qualities but how many times can you set and watch the crew fearfully wait out depth charge barrages,not to mention they leave the germans witha absolutely no human qualities making them into monsters instead of men. You want to see a good submarine movie see the classic. You know the one,and if not I can see why you rented this."
2,"Poor, pro ameriacan trash","This is a 'true story'... but the seamen were English, not American. The story is overblown, over dramatised and fairly forgettable. No stand out performances, special effects are ok, but lack any new material. Its the same old hollywood story under the pretense of truth. If you want ot see a good submarine movie buy Crimson Tide."
4,The most intense movie,"In this movie there is not a single boring part.The movie has great action,acting and a great story. Its one of the best submarine movies i have ever seen."
1,U won't care for this one,"Sat down and saw this one on televion.Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money.What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.This film Awful."
1,Ask for your money back,"If I could get my money back, I would. This is a fiction based on fact that Hollywood destroyed. The acting was awful, and the story strayed from the actual incident so much that it was laughable. Hollywood's use of special effects foreclosed any realism, so much that the movie is better described as ludicrous. I could not wait for it to end. Das Boot is a much better movie."
1,This movie should go below crush depth as soon as possible.,Technically accurate? How much is technical accuracy worth when the whole story is a monsterous lie?
1,Why pay to see this movie?,There is nothing in this movie that anyone needs to see. It contains no factual information and it is boring.
1,Does anybody have a german wordbook !?!,Capturing (and operating) german U-boat without knowing german language. What is next ? Heroic sailors who don' t know how to swimm?
1,One of the worst ever,"So bad, on so many levels, not the least of which is the casting. If you can stomach the lightweight wimp McWhateverHisNameIs, you just might be able to hack submarine duty yourself. But I doubt it. It's an insult to even mention this heap of garbage within earshot of Das Boot(oops, sorry), the best war film ever made. Hollywood is incapable of making a REAL war movie, partly because war has never come to this country, but mostly because Hollywood is concerned with ""entertainment,"" not art. All copies of this should be confiscated and sent to the bottom of the ocean, along with the director and pitiful actors."
1,Historical innacuracy,"Maybe a good movie but woefully inaccurate historically. The stealing of the Enigma machine actually occurred before the US entered WWII.... I guess sooner or later Hollywood will have rewritten history to such an extent that the US will always have existed and that Europe is in fact a US colony, not the other way round!"
1,Rated PG for Pure Garbage!,"About the only thing they got right was that World War Two was fought in the in a lot of water with boats. Mediocre acting aside, the historical inaccuracies were so glaring that they were an acutal distraction.Not to go too deep; so many have already posted excellent (bad - but fitting) reviews to this movie. I'll just add a few observations as well.* Submarines of the time did not have the capability to conduct sub to sub combat while submerged. I think they got this confused with Hunt for Red October.* You wouldn't see a German Destroyer alone that far from the coast.* If we needed to break the code - I'd assume they didn't know the code - yet they knew that a German Sub was in trouble.* The enigma machine was a good catch (which the British actually accomplished) but it was the code books that were the real key.* German plane would have been incapable of reaching that scene.* Etc....For a real underwater classic, Das Boot is the only choice you need."
1,Remember that it is only FICTION,"Treat this movie as the fiction it is, and enjoy it. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who has served their country due to the obvious LACK OF RESEARCH that accompanies the film. If Hollywood can't get their facts right (even in a fictional sense), then it would be nice if they didn't use names that describe an actual event or object. For historical accuracy, it was an Australian working under the British that cracked the Enigma Code."
3,I've seen worse,"This movie is o.k. and like I said in the title of this review, I have seen worse.That implies that I hvae seen better. I have seen better. This movie is no where near the caliber of ""Das Boot."" If you want a movie about WWII submariners, then that is what I would get."
2,Too Predictable,"This movie is a perfect example of Hollywood's love of special effects, and disregard of realism. Everything in this movie explodes in a blinding flash of gasoline. The sinking of the German destroyer is arguably the greatest departure from realism.The plot is weak and far too predictable, what passes for foreshadowing is so simplistic, a six-year-old recognizes it. In addition, there are far too many unexplained incidents, the worst of which occurs early in the movie when the U-571 is disabled by depth charges from the British Navy, and the sub has no choice but to surface. And guess what? Suddenly, the British Navy is nowhere to be seen! Of course, if realism were a concern, the sub would surface and be blown out of the water by the destroyer and the movie would be over.Don't buy this movie. If you have to see it, go rent it...one viewing will be sufficient."
1,U-571,Pathetic USA rewrite of history. British sailors died in the real incident. Please boycott or suffer more stupid reworks.
1,"U571, A War Flick...NOT","Having heard the general plot of this movie and knowing the Allies had had at least two events which followed the plot, I expected this movie in some way to relate to reality. I guess the director decided that real war would not sell tickets. The movie is complete fantasy. The choice was made to use a few facts, which serves to confuse the audience. Kubrick, Spielburg, and other skilled directors have proven war flicks can be realistic, interesting, and exciting. I found this movie completely lacking in the first two criteria."
4,Very entertaining,Lots of action. Really enjoyed this movie. This is a well made submarine movie. I like all the cast in this film.
3,u571,"Way too many depth charges. The UBoat was realistic to the boat in Das Boot. But , Hollywood over did.the distroyer sub hunt."
5,Totally Awesome and Breathtaking movie!,"U-571 is an excellent movie. You are kept at the edge of your seat the entire time. That is what makes this such an excellent movie. I know some people say to rent Das Boat instead, but come on, the movie was #1 for weeks. There's a good reason for that, the suspense and the action. Some of my friends say that there is too much action but everybody knows that having too much action is virtialy impossible. Who ever gives a movie 1-3 stars becauses thay think there is too much action? That is what happened anyway. You have got to get this movie. It'll blow you right out of the water!"
3,Fun for What It Is,"U-571 is a non-historically accurate movie about a group of Americans who commandeer a Nazi U-Boat. Not everything goes according to plan, of course, and soon Matthew Mcconaughey and his buddies are scrambling and fighting for their lives. It's fast and intense, with fantastic set design and awesome sound. Make sure to turn your soundsystem up loud. You really feel at times as if your living room couch has become a claustrophobic, cramped vessel far below the sea. If this sounds cool to you, and you're not a stickler for historical accuracy, then U-571 should entertain you. Don't expect any unexpected character design or the most original plot of all time, but it's fun enough."
3,Entertaining but little more,"This movie makes for some good light entertainment but don't expect much more. The plot leaves you asking many questions along the way and several of the scenes seem very predictable. Many of the effects are good, but at times seemed a little too improbable. I couldn't help comparing it to what is in my opinion, the best submarine movie by far, ""Das Boot"", and finding it very inferior. Still, not a bad pick up at the video store."
4,U-571 a film reveiw,"U-571 is a film about americas involvement in the process of breaking the enigma codes. it uses fantastic graphics and themusic completely gives a title of heroism for the americans and relly tenses the viewer in a climax point. the film gives no chance to really bond to the germans as they are portrayed as evil and they are beastily unshaven men and it all falls into perspective. the americans however as in all american war films are portrayed as heroic young well presented men that hardly ever swear and sre always there to save someone. The americans when storming the U-boat seem to ecape any injury while the germans seem to cop the bullets whenever needed so. the plot all seems to fall into place and give the americans a form of great heroism and all in all a good movie does the job, the job has been done and a good movie has been made a good view and the climaxes are awesome. to bad its alittle corny towards the americans."
4,Men of a Mission,"This movie is a fictional tale about a daring mission to capture a top secret Nazi coding device from German submarine. This movie is inspired by a composite of events that transpired during the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. an American submarine crew's battle against time-and their own fears-while carrying out a daring mission to capture a top-secret encrypting device (ENIGMA) from a Nazi U-boat.This movie is very exciting and thrilling!! After watching this movie, you may think something about war.AND... Jon Bon Jovi did a great job!! He became a hip actor! ..."
4,definitely worth a try,"There are a lot of critics who rightly point out the historical inaccuracies of this story, but let us not lose perspective...this was good entertainment. I liked the story, I liked the photography, and yes I liked the explosions and the effects. It kept me and my family entertained and that's a key element. Obvious comparisons to Das Boot by many reviewers missed the point that this is essentially a very different film. Das Boot was made in the same genre as ""all quiet on the western front"": an unglamorous and somber warning of the misery of war. This is a fictional tale based upon real life events, ( just like many other works of fiction) and it's pretty well done. Try it - you'll like it"
3,"U-571, What Hollywood has Become","U-571 has tremendous special effects, but so do millions of other movies. Know what else millions of other movies have? Weak plot, weak characterization, bad acting. Know what U-571 has? The same. It's true this film is griping, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat, but other that than there's not much else going for it. Like so many other movies U-571 relies on special effects to keep it afloat, which is why in the end it survived.It was a good story, unfortunately they rushed to get it out, slapped in some dialoge, composited some special effects, and hired Bill Paxton. Fun to watch if you've got time to waste."
3,"Well made movie, but rather unrealistic...","The movie ""U571"" is a well made movie. Nice pictures, very good sound.But the point, which I critize, is, that the film is rather unrealistic. Think about the American soldiers, who learn how to use an alien ship during a fight. Moreover they are able to repair the boat and to destroy a large battle ship with only one shot.At least, as some of other writers already said, hollywood changes historical facts for a better selling in the USA. And that should nobody do, especially with such a special topic like the World War 2."
4,Good movie with impressive sound and a great story,"I have the DVD (Collector's Edition), and I enjoyed this movie very much. The visual effects are great and so is the sound. I especially liked the well-written script that keeps the watcher in suspense throughout this great movie. The special features were a plus. The reason I gave this movie four and not five stars is because the ending was not as brilliant as the rest of the movie. I definitely encourage you to add this movie to your collection."
4,Good DVD except for Widescreen Format,"We thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the story. Unfortunately, it was one of the first DVD's we bought to watch on our new DVD player, and it could only be viewed in widescreen format. While the clarity of the picture and the sound effects were awesome compared to VHS, the widescreen format is annoying for those of us who do not have widescreen TV's. Again, not quite as annoying as widescreen in VHS, but bothersome nonetheless. All that being said, this was definitely an edge of your seat thriller, and the extras that are part of the DVD were fascinating. Highly recommend, as long as you don't mind the widescreen formatting."
3,"Well, It was exciting.....","This movie was not that good. I give it 2 1/2 stars. The plot is very incoherent. At one moment, they are ready to leave, the next a sub pops up, and I'm told it was american, but it blows up the other american sub! Then it chases the german sub, which is occupied by the americans, and starts firing at it. The american crew one the german one tries to knock out the torpedoes from the other, but they end ip blowing it to pieces. All through this sequence I was going, what? The plot, as stated above, was incoherent, but the movie was very exciting. I was sad when some people died, although I actually didn't really like the crew."
2,U571 Review,"U571 is a badly written film. It is a bias film that would have had potential but it didnt. I didnt like it because it was boring and there was no suspense. An example of this is when there all dancing, about to go on the submarines. It lacked a the true storyline, and this is the main reason of the movies weakness. The that were bertrayed were very realistic, such as the germans and how they looked not as heroic as the americans. they looked like dogs, with smely underarms and they hadnt shaved for a few days. This was the main positive thought of the film. Overall it wasnt a great success, it was a fizzer meaning everyone thought it would be good and it turned out to be bad. i would give it a two out of five. I dont recommend seeing it. You are just wasting your money when you could be spending it on other movies such as Saving Private Ryan and the Shawshank Redemption."
2,Don't,"I really like the main plot of this movie, that us North Americans are unexpectedly pulled into a developing war. Despite the fact that there were subtitles, I ran into a few problems since I only speak English and Russian, and not German. The camera goes back and forth between the Americans and Germans so that the viewer has the entire point of view, which I don't like because it adds to predictability. Then, when the Americans take over the German sub, everything is said so technically and is confusing as all out. They could have made the sub engine gears more subtle, and focused on the battle, but they didn't.In conclusion, the first half was fairly good, but the rest is REALLY REALLY hard to sit through. Try ""Crimson Tide"". This is a no go."
3,B-grade Das Boot wannabe. Generic Hollywood stuff.,"U-571 is a typical Hollywood B flick, with all the formulaic trappings you know by heart. Other reviewers have compiled the historical and technical inaccuracies, so I won't repeat them here.No, U-571 poses no threat at all to Das Boot. You won't miss much if you skip it. Just keep it on your ""maybe"" list ... sooner or later, you'll need an undemanding, mildly enjoyable actioner for your pizza-and-a-video night."
1,God this is wrong,"U-571 is a film that was about WWII U-boats from the American forces stealing the enigma from the Germans, WRONG. This movie has got the real history all wrong. It was the Brittish(Poms) that took the Enigma off Hitlers army. I would know I studied WWII history at Oxford Universty."
1,u - 571,this is one of the worse propaganda war films ever esp. about sub warfare. its so unbelievable and just some hollywood garbage. i would watch das boot which is 100% better and much more realistic.all and all this movie bites big time. bad!
1,Get it right,"i don't know if you are but i am sick and tired of Americans changing history so they can cry and blow there nose on other countries national flags. U-571 was the same again. The movie should of been named ""Yanks are up themselves"" or ""We didn't do anything in the war so lets pretend we did"".I also hate how the Americans are alwayus so clean cut and loyal and there opponments are rough, dirty and scraggy. Not that i am saying the the Germans where all well cut but there was not that bigger difference between the to opposing countries. For example the americans are all well shaven, well dressed and well stuck up themselves saying quotes like ""this enigma machine will make or break the war"" and ""we are doing this for America"" as they sail off into the sunset. but in comparresment not one German is shaven they all have scrappy cloths and are hidding at the depths of the sea. to end don't see it it messes with your mind"
1,Painful to watch...,"Another product of Hollywood's ""Karaoke Culture"". In an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind, we have in ""U-571"" an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of ""Das Boot"". But instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war, we get a cheap flag-waving pile of Hollywood propaganda. The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category. U-571 is just another thin, over-promoted, throw-away movie you'll forget the day after you see it."
1,Oh dear oh dear,"Here we go again, Hollywood stealing the history of another nation and passing it off as their own. It amazes me that Hollywood feels the need to steal the history of other nations when there are many untold stories of American WW2 success that could be told instead. This doesn't just insult the British (who actually captured the enigma machine before America even joined the war), but it's also an insult to the Americans to have Hollywood try to pass this off as American history, not to mention an insult to both the American and British military personnel who actually fought this terrible war. ..."
1,Total rubbish,"For any person who knows a little about WWII history this movie is pure torture to watch.It is not so much that the whole plot is fantasy(the capture of the Enigma machine was done by the Royal Navy in very dangerous,but by far less spectacular, circumstances than the one depicted in the film)but that the whole atmosphere of the film is wrong.Pure common sense is affronted in many scenes as are historical facts(a few men man a submarine in an altogether impossible attack?a german destroyer and figther plane in the North Atlantic in 1942?Give me a break!)This film is a simple action movie in the way a 007 James Bond film is.If Hollywood wanted to make a film about the U.S submarine force in WWII it could have chosen many good stories from the Pacific theatre,like the one about the USS Wahoo.As it is this film is a travesty of a war movie.Want to see a good WWII submarine movie?Get Wolfgang Petersen's DAS BOOT."
4,I Was Entertained from Beginning To End,"When i put the movie in the player and hit play... i was completly surprised to see an action scene right in the beginning. But wow. The story line was very easy to follow, and i found many of the details, though perhaps not of the mission (to steal a German code machine), But of the designs of the subs, inside and outside. It really had be riveted to the chair i was in, and gave me a scary view of the cramped, leakey interior of a WWII U-Boat. The best scene in the movie was when the american crew of the U-Boat... oops, cant tell that until yove seen the movie, sorry!"
3,Better than I expected,"I World War II fictional movie in the old Hollywood war film tradition. Sound and video quality (DVD) are first-rate.It may have the distinction of the worst music score created for such a film. The composer (I did not recognize his name) was trying to write like Bill Conti and failed.As everyone has indicated, Das Boot is far better artistically, but this film should be appreciated by war movie fans."
4,Very good WWII movie!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought the acting was a little weak in some cases. Overall, well worth the time."
4,fascinating movie,"I have this VCD long time ago and was very fascinating movie with breathtaking moment from beginning until the end,now I have this HDDVD version and brings up the memory of deep low bass bangover my hometheatre with very clear bubble splash out as the depth chargers bump up the sub, but unfortunately my system cannot produce dolby true hd since I have been waiting to see what receivers will come out on August. This disc will be great media for testing the total performance of the new HD feature.System:Denon AVR3805, xbox360 add on HDDVD, Mordaunt short Avant,optoma HD70"
4,Submarine warfare...,"An excellent story about a few U.S. naval men who attempt to seize a German communications device on board a German sub. While aboard the German sub, complications arise and the crew must flee under Lt. Andy Tyler (Matthew McConuahey) who was recently denied command of his own sub. Andy is forced to take command of the German sub after his superior (Bill Paxton) is left behind in order to carry out the mission objective. Assuming his first command, Andy must earn the respect of his crew and prove that he can lead them to victory - more importantly, survival. With several men down, the skeleton crew begins to believe in Andy and proudly execute his orders as the Germans try to sniff them out from above with depth charges.McConuahey does a superb job playing a young Lieutenant who must fill the shoes of his late commander.An exciting story of submarine warfare and military tactics."
1,U-571,"It was a British submarine that captured the first enigmas and the Americans captured one at the end of the war. This film portrays the Ameericans to have won the battle for the Eastern Seaboard. Those British sailors would turn in their graves!Watch at the end, the first few enigmas were captured by her majesty's ships. A true disgrace of a film!"
4,Awesome.,"U-571 is technically a 'war' movie, but character development and unexpected plot twists make it much more than a stereotype. The storyline keeps your mind engaged and your heart in gear. I became endeared to the characters, but also remained aware and concerned about the group's mission. A thinker's action movie, this is well worth the watch."
3,U-571 strikes again!,U-571 is a new film that has been released in the USA and around the world been fairly successful.In the film there are two main countries that are fighting each other (the Germans and the Americans). The Americans of course are made out to be the courageous men wearing the white suits and the finely shaved beards looking very smart to the viewer. This then made them look like the good guys in the film. The Germans are made out to be the bad guys in the film with their dress been rather scrubbed up and their beards been not shaven at all.The film rather in accurate in the way it betrayed both of countries in the way that they did. An inaccuracy was that the Americans weren't even in the war yet. The Americans didn't move in to the war until a later stage.Overall I thought that the film was rather inaccurate and wasn't good to be bartered on the film that was released in the cinema. I gave the film 3/5.
4,Very good movie Dont listen to these liars,"I rented this movie awhile ago and to my suprise i found it very Well done and entertaining. Please dont listen to the ""Wanna be Historians"" who think they know everything about War and what took place in those times. They get theyre info from the same old men i get mine from, are ""Fathers & Grandfathers."" it may not be Accurate or it may very well be. But what does it matter i ask? The movie is entertaining and keeps your brain wanting to know more of the story line and plot. Why would you be watching this movie for history lessons... if you want that go to school, or find you a book. Also They do have a channel called the ""History"" channel that does provide some great & accurate War Pictures and Movies. Please dont cast your negative thoughts on a good movie and spoil it for others just because you want a history lesson to go with it."
2,Let's get the facts right.,"Wait one minute here!The enigma code was cracked by Polish mathematicians, not the British and certainly not the US.I have had it up to here with this being portrayed as an English or even American job. Let's be perfectly clear about this. The Poles cracked the engima, it was Polish commandos who helped storm the U-boats as well, don't see any of the British mentioning that, so as I see their no better than the Americans in this respect. The Poles work was one of the most important, if not the most important victories of the war and it deserves recognition, obviously it won't get any recognition from this film.As for the film itself, well it's no Das Boot that's for sure, on a purely entertainment level it's not bad, but if you know you history you may be grinding your teeth through it. Worth seeing mainly for the subs."
1,Propaganda,It is merely a propaganda film. History is so twisted that I want to vomit in disgust.If I ever bought this movie I would feel so bad that I would kill myself with a table saw.
2,Ridiculous plot holes,"Aside from the blatant (even worse than Braveheart, which is saying something) historical inaccuracies, this movie has other problems. How exactly did a single German destroyer manage to materialize in the middle of the Atlantic ocean? Apart from the massive difficulties involved in getting past the Royal Navy, that type of ship would be cutting it very close to have enough fuel for the round-trip plus sub hunting. And German losses in destroyers were so heavy in 1940 that they needed every last one they had for duties closer to home. Having the ""milch cow"" u-boat arrive to pick up the crew was not an unreasonable idea, but everything after that is just silly. WW2 submarine captains only wished enemy destroyers disintegrated like that after a single torpedo hit. Don't waste your time with this pulp fiction, go check out Das Boot or Run Silent, Run Deep instead."
1,THE WORST,"This movie attempts to present itself as an historically based submarine adventure. Unfortunately, it is grossly inaccurate historically, to the point of being insulting;especially to the Brits. They seized an enigma device before we even entered the war. The submarine warfare is so over the top it's absurd. If you want to see crazy stunts and over the top action I'd recommend a good Bond film. If you want to see a great WW2 submarine flick, see Das Boot. Forget about this turkey."
3,"Good flick, but nothing to write home about","An American submarine is launched on a hastily organized mission to recover the Enigma code machine from a damaged German sub. If successful, this mission will provide the Allies with a decided advantage against the Nazis. This film is historically misleading (the British captured Enigma), but exciting in an efficient, workmanlike way. I was entertained as the crew careened from peril to peril. There's nothing new here, but it's a fun ride."
2,Weak,"The acting in this movie was alright at best. The special effects, well, most of them anyway, were passable. During the sinking of the allied sub, you could tell the actors were in a tank on some studio lot. In fact, the tank didn't even look like it was deep enough. Some of the characters were literraly squatting on the bottom of the tank so it would look like they were drowning.The story alomost made sense. It was, in fact, the British who originally captured Enigma, not the Americans. And the Brits didn't get the machine off a captured sub, either.The part that really, really, bugged me about the movie was the ending. (I won't give it away, but for those of you who have seen this movie) it seemed rather lazy to me. I wanted the dierctor to spend a few extra bucks and expand on the ending.This movie is entertaining enough if you don't have anything better to watch.For sub movies, however, I still prefer The Hunt For Red October and Crimson Tide."
2,"It's nothing compared to ""Das Boot""","This submarine film has numerous and realistic special effects and action sequences, but that's the only good thing about this film. When compared to the film Das Boot, this one would never stand a chance. The characters are flat, the music is too bombastic, and the ending is a bit too sappy. I say watch it for the special effects and the action sequences. I also say watch Das Boot if you want what life is REALLY like in a submarine.Grade: D"
4,a great story well told and well acted,"based on true events this story is told without the typical hollywood herowinning the war on his own, the cast is with out a major star but does not need one, its the story that carries you along, this dvd is one of the fewthat are home theatre demonstration dvd's re the soundtrack, if you own orare able to view this dvd with a decent subwoofer setup, then you are in for a treat, not overdone with explosions, but enough at the appropiate timeto give the sub a good workout, try and listen to the DTS5.1 version if youcan,"
4,M15 Dark Blonde,"I tried several of the shades which all require two applications to get the best coverage. Some tend to get too dark. This color is the best match if you have medium to light brown hair. It will match your hair almost exactly. It makes a paste that you brush on, which doesn't drip like hair color, so there is no big mess. Apply heavily too stubborn areas and comb thru with a comb, to coat all the hairs. It has never stained my skin or irritated it at all. Just shampoo out in the shower. You get at least 4 to 5 applications. Highly recommended."
4,Works fine for me..,"I like to use the lightest brown shade, I have used the others at a push, but they make me look like Bluto. The trouble is, it's hard to find that shade in stores, and impossible since I moved here to Bulgaria from the UK, so ordering online is the only option. It can work out a bit pricey, what with the shipping costs added, but at least I get 4 applications per box. I've not personally had any problems as far as allergy goes, though it can stain the skin a little at the time, but going around after with a flannel/cloth and some soap soon removes it with a gentle rub. I don't always have to do this though, depends on how clumsy I am applying it at the time."
2,beware some kind of chemical burn,"i think they changed the formula. now, when i use it my face itches like crazy and i've seen red blister like places on my face. it's driving me crazy. can anyone recommend another beard dye?"
1,Like Acid for Your Face,"First off, I've never been allergic to anything except ragweed in the fall. No detergents or medicines or creams have ever bothered me. But after a few applications of this (and I used it correctly, not overdosing or leaving it on too long) my face broke out with red blotches like boils.I would stay far away from this.I'd much prefer a product that took longer and didn't tear up my face."
1,No bueno. Too baggy & unflattering. Returned them,"If you are looking for a more modest, relaxed workout/yoga pant, maybe these would work for you. For me, I found the fit to be baggy in most areas & overall unflattering. I put them on & my butt instantly got flatter & I looked like I gained 10 pounds - um, no thanks! The description boasts ""maximum compression"" & I think that even if I were to order an extra small (I am 5'10"", about 145 lbs & wear a Medium), there would really be no compression at all. Sorry, these are a miss & I returned them. Looking for a true compression pant? Try the Reebok Women's Easytone Pant. I have them & love them!! (see my review on the product page)."
2,80's Yoga pant,"I had purchased these pants with the hopes of wearing them for yoga and then able to use them in other instances. The waistband was not a waistband at all - but rather a thin piece of elastic covered by fabric - as opposed to a thicker flattering waistband allowing for easier movement in yoga.The pants also came up very high on my hips, in comparison to many other yoga pants I have had. I was not impressed - and I returned them without incident."
3,it's okay,"I bought this to help get back in shape after having a baby. I heard that a support band can help shrink your hips if you wear it for 6 weeks postpartum. I guess it's working, my hips hurt at the end of the day. They could be moving. I just wish that it were more comfortable to wear."
3,Postpartum Abdomen Support-small size,"it is helping me in loosing my tummy , its breathable tooo.. but it comes out while i am trying to sit down or change my sitting position"
3,Visible under clothes,"I used this maybe twice after the birth of my child. It was uncomfortable & visible under clothing and after several hours of wearing it my back hurt. It did help to ""remind"" me to suck in my stomach to help rebuild the abdominal muscles."
4,Works well,"Easy to use, comfortable to wear, and it's inexpensive. It does slide around a bit, but I expected that and it's not too much of a hassle to readjust. I like the gentle support it provides and found the sizing to be accurate."
4,Does the job!,"I purchased this item when my twins were 5 mos. old after realizing that I had diastasis recti. The support band did a great job of reminding me to hold my abs in to help the muscles come back together. The band did not do this for me. It was not clearly visible under clothes unless I was wearing only a t-shirt. My normal body is a size 4 or 6 and the small fit great. I thought the band was too wide--it was continually creeping up during my regular day--so I cut it in half and works even better! Now I use one half when I am in the gym and the other half for regular wear. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a reminder to ""suck it in""!"
3,Smaller than expected,"This item runs on the smaller side, so if you were a small pre-pregnancy, you may want to order a Medium. It also bunches up and can be uncomfortable sometimes."
2,Not the best,"I recently had my 5th c-section and was hoping to find a support band that would support my stomach as it healed from the c-section. I loved the maternity support band by the same company but was dissapointed with this one. Yes, it does support but it is very uncomfortable."
2,Disappointing release,"Being a fan of all Disney animated cartoons and features, I regret to say that I was quite disappointed by this release. The problem isn't with the subject matter, but with what's actually on the DVD. As an earler reviewer mentioned, scenes were cut in which characters were seen smoking. I have to ask why? (Espcially when they leave in a scene which shows a ""young"" airplane drinking gasoline). What else was removed from the movie that we don't know about? In the bonus material they mention two other characters, an armadillo and a burro, which weren't part of the feature. Were they originally? I recall seeing the burro character as a child while watching the Wonderful World of Disney on NBC. Maybe an expert on Disney movies could enlighten us.Disney, let parents decide what their children should watch. Remain true to the original films."
3,For True Disney Fans,"This film was made during the war and Walt didn't have the money to turn out another full length animated film. To appease his fans, he made a film which is basically a trip with him and some of his best animators ""South of the Border."" The animators where then inspired to make several short animated films, which are all packaged together to make this feature. The back of the box says ""Total Running Time: Approc. 75 Minuites."" By total running time, the mean with special features. The film is only 45 minuites, and the bonus ""South of the Border With Disney"" was a television show he did. If you are not a Disney fan, I don't recomend this film to you, because it is not like the other well known animated films you are used to. The picture and sound are not very good. Disney didn't feel the need to tough it up because hardley anyone knew of it's existance."
3,Disappointing New Arrival,"Though this is the first time this movie has been released to VHS and DVD, the release is marred by Disney's unscrupulous editing of scenes in which Goofy and Joe Carioca are seen smoking. If you don't mind paying Disney to cut their cartoons, go ahead and buy. Otherwise, wait for the unedited versions."
3,"A good Disney film, but not an essential one","SALUDOS AMIGOS is an obscure Disney film from 1943. Even though it is offically marketed and promoted by the studio as its 6th animated feature, it has many live-action or non-animated segments. The animated ""shorts"" mixed into the film are entertaining, but the live-action ""documentary"" sequences get tiresome after a while and are very dated by today's standards. And since SALUDOS AMIGOS is only 42 minutes long, it just barely qualifies as a feature film.SALUDOS AMIGOS is a very average Disney film from the studio's golden era, and time hasn't been as kind to it as it has been to many of its other animated films."
2,Little of Walt,"I bought this for the bonus-feature, real-life, travelogue of Walt and his artists in South America. It was about a 30-minute travelogue. It is OK, but I was disappointed, because Walt is shown only a few times, and does not talk, and his artists do not talk. If money is no object; South America of that era-gone-by is beautiful. It is too bad South America is not that way anymore. There are some interesting things; and you get a little humor at the end with a candid shot of Walt and the Disney smile.Skimming the cartoon, the main feature did not look so great. For a cartoon; I would choose ""Chip N' Dale"", or Mickey Mouse in ""Mickey's Trailer"" within ""Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 7 - Extreme Adventure Fun"".Walt's real-life trip took place during the strike at the Studio back home. Walt was hurt by the strike, and was on vacation to recover; not to make a great film; but the bonus-feature is OK."
1,Anouther censored piece of art.,Disney felt they had to censor Goofy's smoking. Like some idiot is really going to start smoking because of a cartoon. The reason I like old films is because they are from a time when the world wasn't PC. I hope someday in the future Disney releases an uncut version. The same way the release Dragonball. Edited version & uncut version
1,"Disappointing, short, and dull...","This is bottom of the barrel Disney. A 42-minute puff piece for Latin America, it contains only four animated sequences, only two of which (""Lake Titicaca"" & ""El Gaucho Goofy"") are moderately entertaining. The rest is dreadful, live-action travelogue fodder, the kind of thing you sat through in elementary school assemblies back in the 1950s. There's another endless live-action short about Disney's crew gathering local color (which has to be added to the so called ""feature"" to get the 75 minute running time on the box info). Both of these films should have been added as bonuses to THE THREE CABALLEROS disc. Though the Disney completists may drool over this long-lost film finally being released, kids and most adults will find most of it painful to sit through. A snore."
1,Politically correct = Insanity,"Just to (maybe) give the last reviewers some hint about Disney's motive: I think they don't want to be sued alongside with Marlboro & al. 45 years from now when the present viewers will look for some entertainment (and some more money for their lawyers) during their old days, by making somebody else responsible for their choices. By the way, G. Orwell (1984) thought only the communists were prone to alter history so it suits what they wanted you to know/believe."
3,Thorough and Interesting Review of Subject,"Facisnating book, especially the ancient history and the posibility of Columbus knowing more about the New World than we may think (pp.72-76). However, there are some glaring errors. Like when the author blames the destruction of the Alexandria Library on ""Christian mobs."" Sorry, that's a myth. Then he blames Middle Age ignorance on Christians. Newsflash, the Renaissance didn't just appear out of nowhere. The Middle Ages is where universities began and monks preserved and passed on knowledge. Nor did everyone think Earth was flat, nor does the Bible say so. Nor were the Arabs the savior of Europe. Sure they did pass on some ancient literature, but who advanced and who stayed mired in the Middle Ages? If you can get past these flaws, this is a great book. See also:The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success"
5,Final Fantasy VIII... Need I say more?,"Final Fantasy VIII is easily the best RPG out there. With it's incredible graphics, great music and character interactions, the player feels as if they're in the games. It has an engaging plot and the atmosphere induces many different emotions from the player. A love story with magic, mystery, and evil intentions. Another ""Best Seller"" in the making from Squaresoft."
2,Badd!,"I have played all of the other Final Fantasies, and I was sorely disappointed with FF8. The game play was confusing, especially with the use of magic, and the plot and story line just sucked. The story line was so cheesy, numerous times I had to shut the game off and walk out of the room! The next FF had better be just awesome to make up for this collosal flop!"
3,Ok game,"this game was ok, the battels take to long and the graphics arent all what its cracked up to be."
4,effritable magical experience,"Oh no more materia to power your weapon and magic ok replace by some powers you have to find and win ok new challenge.Yes no more saucage charcters human finally. If only Final Fantasy 7 could have human type character instead of those funny 3d balloon looks well then ff7 would have kicked ... of ff8.Folks did you know that FF7 has one the most amazing ending it is in the top 10 of the best ending game of all time.If you haven't played the game get it ride the chocobos use alexander materia, oh oh and use the so powerfull bahamut zero and omega materia ouch i killed sephiroth like that :o)GhostRider666 The Spirit Of Vengeance."
2,Sorry Square,"I was anticipating this game since the ff7. I'm also sorry to say that it was the biggest let down i'v ever had. The game graphicly is astounding, the fmvs and charactor designe is spectacular. The mini pocketstation game was a nice touch, but thats where it stops. The game itself is losely strug together with no real central plot. The music is below par (except for the chocobo song)and often gets anoying durring play. The battles draw on and on litteraly. the draw magic system is horrible! most boss battles are spent drawing the magic from the enimies taking usually over 30 minutes. I never beat the game because i was too board by the final disk. If you really want a great RPG then buy Grandia, Lunar SSS or the sims. So in ten words or less: Square you could have done a lot better. *sorry for the typos*"
3,Comments and facts,"Final Fantasy 8 has got great graphics. It can utilise hardware acceleration for better 3D animation. However, the game is slow especially in the overworld. The game doesn't work well with 3D card based on GeForce chipset because you will have to download the 9.8MB patch from Squaresoft. Disc 1 is great but the rest is not that great. Another thing about the game is that damage is always so high in any of the battles."
2,A buy for the fans.,"Final Fantasy VIII was ok. It had great movie scenes, but an AWFUL battle system. It takes at least 20 minutes to complete a battle and thats just for one bad guy! I bought this game thinking I'm going to love it. I was wrong. My advice don't get it unless you're desprate for a game and I mean desprate!!!"
1,Definately not a good choice for an RPG on the PC,"I guess if you like to have variety in your RPGs, you can play this game to help you figure out the good RPGs from the bad ones on the PC. I'll admit, this is a nice game...on the PSX. But on the PC, it doesn't compare to Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Planescape, Septerra Core, or numerous other RPGs on the PC. The dialogue sucks, the plot is more or less a re-hash of FF7, the battles take WAY too long, and the music is horrible when compared to earlier Final Fantasies. If you want a better console RPG on PC, go get FF7."
1,"All hype, no play value",The Final Fantasy series has been steadily declining in worth since FF6. Squaresoft now seems to rely on 'pretty boy' villian such as Sephiroth and What's-his-name from this game. The plot of the last two games was just plain bad. The GF system in this game was extreemly annoying. Why play this when GOOD games like Baldur's Gate are out there? My advice is to avoid this game like the plague and save your money for something else.
1,A Good Series goes Swirling Down the Can,"After the genius of FF6 (FF3 in America) and the brilliance and intrigue of FF7, this is EASILY the series' biggest letdown. Final Fantasy6 and 7 were succesful for many reasons, one of which was intriguing storyline and likeable characters, both of which the game fails at. After playing it for only a few minutes, you'll probably think or wish (as I did) the following: ""The characters will all HAVE to become more likeable by the end"". HA! They don't, and eventually I started hoping they'd all get in a fiery plane crash (or airship crash, whatever). Plus, there is virtually no need for money seeing as you armor etc. never goes beyond the clothes on your back. These factors and an ending that was apparantly slapped together by some programmers who were and just wanted to end this crap make this game the worst FF to date, though FF9 seems quite competitive in that category."
1,"Good for the Playstation, bad for the PC","The Playstation has a 33mhz proccersor, 2 megs of ram, no hard drive space, and runs a game that requires a pentiumII 266mhz. I just can't update my pc, the game itself is good, but when it plays like it was in slow motion on my machine, then you shouldn't buy it for the pc."
2,Is it really worth it??,"Though considered a classic by many, FF8 raises the question ""Is it really worth it?"" The first good RPG I played was FF7. After playing FF7 I went on to purchase FF5,6,8,and 9. A great disappointment was my purchase of FF8. The game was lacking in its fantasy like elements. The opening to the game was very impressive and caught my attention immediately. The games graffics were mediocore and the battle system was missing great features from the first game. They replaced them with the junction system which drew all the fun out of the game. Overall if you look beyond its flaws, weak story line, and pointless plot ideas and misselaneous missions ypu have a, well bad game."
5,FF8 help,"For all those who are thinking of buying this game I have a few helpful hints for you... If you have a regular pentuim (like mine), make sure that you have at least 32 megabytes of RAM, or... the game will move really slow. For the 3d accelerater, a voodoo 2 or higher works just fine. If you have a lower version of the accelerater the game just won't find it and you'll have an error saying ""video accelerater not found"", and the game won't run. The graphics are great and the music is a typical quarter note sound. The storyline is very similar to FF7, which is why this game is so great. I am a huge fan of FF7 and now... FF8!"
3,close but no chedda,"The game is pretty good but would neva reach the superior ff7. FF7 is by far the best final fantasy, then comes nine, then comes 8, the materia is by far the easiest way to equip the items. But i gatta hand it to ff8 best graphics so far. The story is ok not as good as ff7 which has the best story ever. Ff7 has the best story and character development. Before you get ff8 get ff7 then get ff9 then get ff8, and be sure to check out ff10 which is coming out soon it looks dope."
3,"Good Story, Strange Battle System","I really like Final Fantasy VII. It had a very interesting story, an excellent battle system and great graphics. Final Fantasy VIII is not nearly as good. The storyline is good and I liked it, but the other things bring it down.The Battle System is too strange for me. The whole drawing magic and GFs is confusing. The magic system should be simpler than that. There is hardly any character development either. The stories behind most of the minor characters is hardly even explained, other than that they all knew each other.The graphics are very good and the cutscenes are excellent. There is no flaw there. There must have been a lot of work put into creating these cutscenes. Even on the PC version, they are crisp and clear.Overall, it's an OK game but with flaws. Many people probably disagree, but this just was not a great Final Fantasy game."
4,Another FF smash...,"This is another good FF game, but it didn't appeal to me as much as FF7 did. The game has excellent graphics and movies and support for all video cards, but I liked the gameplay in FF7 better. What I got most hooked on in the game was the mini-card game. Its very fun and you can get items for obtaining certain cards.Like in FF7, FF8 has an excellent storyline in which Squaresoft does best anyways. The Junction Battle System didn't appeal to me as much though. There are Guardian Forces you must collect in the game and you must junction to one to get even the most basic commands. Furthermore, you must find rare items and magazines to get upgrades on your weapons.It is also the wierdest FF game i've played. Usually in RPGs you get a whole bunch of experience for defeating a boss. In this game, you get no exp for bosses or certain enemies. Also, money is salary based in this game. You won't get a single penny from the wandering monsters.All in all, another smash hit FF RPG!!!"
3,Solid Stuff,"Interesting soap operaish TV series, interesting characters who get under your skin the more you watch it. Actually should have given it four stars, but the damned edit won't let me change that."
3,Doesn't meet expectations,"I like David Duchovny. I had heard some good things about Californication and had high hopes. Forty-something writer in a rut trying to get his life straight while navigating the waters of southern california, sleeping with lots of beautiful women along the way. Sounds promising. For me the show falls short and I guess you have blame the writing. Better writing might make the storyline more believable. Too many shortcuts taken to get to the obligatory sex, etc, and it quickly becomes repetitive. I've read descriptions like ""middle aged Entourage"" or ""guy's Sex in the City."" Entourage, while outrageous, is more believable. I'm not a huge fan of Sex in the City but its much better written. Maybe Season Two will be an improvement."
3,California Super Hero,"Duchovny plays a brooding, drunken, womanizer, a writer. It's a stereotype, the sports car and the bar patter. This fellow really doesn't have a job though royalties keeps him at a small place on the beach al la Two and Half Men. He's kind of a family guy if the family guy is an angst ridden, extremely angry, druggie on the make with a teen girl daughter with a weird hairdo and a pretty wife that seems to love his type. Come to think of it - every woman in California is his type, so what's he got to be mad about?D has a cigarette in his mouth, a blonde in his grip, and an agent in S and M. He's sort of a super hero, knocking down the LA obnoxious with a good punch.Look, this is a Hugh Hefner version of a relationship. You get the nuts, screws and technique right out of the letters to Penthouse. Amusing, yes! Can they sustain another season? I'm willing to try."
1,"IT SUCKS, very disappointing","After being one of the most fascinating characters in TV history, David D is just an out of control abnoxious drunk in this show. Go to AA."
2,Smut and vulgar humor attempts to get cheap laughs,"This weekend my wife and I tried watching First Season DVDs for 2 shows we missed out on when they first broadcast on TV ----- Californicaton and Mad Men.While Mad Men ended up being very impressive both in style and writing, Californication seemed to be nothing more than an attempt to get laughs and reactions thru shots of nudity, foul language and body function jokes.After 3 episodes it did not seem to get any better from our perspective, so we hit the EJECT button."
5,"Hillarious, Funny, Nonsense, GREAT show","If you have a great sense of humor and are not tightly wound, you will love all the seasons of this show."
1,A lot of dirty talk and sex scenes but it's not funny.,It has a lot of dirty talk and sex scenes but it's not funny. It's like a cheap soft porn. The dialogues are over the top.
1,Dont watch,Starts off with potential until the second season. How many episodes can you possibly make the same with just a different name?
1,Will this enrich your life in ANY possible way?,Not likely to be on this decade's list of role models about how to parent a 13-yr old through puberty & teenage challenges.Not even an example of how to be a decent human being & father in our morals-deficient society.But if your voyeuristic needs crave for a weekly series (which repeats the same old themes & plots virtually every episode) of someone living a hedonistic lifestyle in our country's capital of indulgence & debauchery (S. California) then you may like this tedious collection of soft porn.
3,Contrived? Derived?,"Okay, I admit it...I look at accidents on the highway and I watched the full first season of Californication.First, it's completely ""overbaked"" including the annoying theme tune...and I watched it anyway. Second, it's completely formulaic right down to the required-for-cable sprinklings of T&A...and; I watched it anyway. The Sex in the City-esque voiceovers - both with and without the typing on the computer - was a hurlfest for me...and I watched it anyway.If I hadn't lived in LA myself and hadn't known more than one guy like Duchovny's character maybe I wouldn't have been sucked in, but alas, I was. Maybe there's some backward-masking or some subliminal messaging that got me through this. I'm not proud to say it, but I watched it and it's okay. Not great IMHO, but okay."
3,hedonistic,"The main character is an author so the dialogue is exceptional. Otherwise the story is simply a vehicle to allow David. D. to get laid by MILFs, usually about twice per show. How many stars in TV land make a sucessful second showing? If you like the star, you should like this show."
3,T & A,"Every guy should be so lucky to get the action Mr. X-Files gets...I guess if you have a reptile brain and the natural talent to zero in on the darkest dampest hole available, you'll find making donuts the old fashion way your true calling...David is a great actor and making softporn look like hardporn is a feat his character makes work."
4,Interesting Show...,"Note: I saw the pilot episode with XFinity On Demand.The pilot episode for this series starring David Duchovny is interesting, and I can relate somewhat to his plight (though I'm a virgin, straight as an arrow and very very very single; no woman would want an ugly little bastard like me). I like this series and I think i'll keep watching it. Definitely NOT for kids."
4,"Good TV series, unexpectedly deep","This series starts with lots of explicit scenes of screwing -- and ends up being a fairly deep meditation on love and loyalty and family.David Duchovny plays a washed-up writer who drinks, snorts drugs and sleeps with anyone who will sleep with him (and apparently there are many) -- but harbors a deep and abiding love for his former partner, about to be married to another man, and their 12-year-old daughter.There are many funny scenes as the series develops and we also meet an interesting supporting cast. But the laughs and the sex scenes become fewer as the story unfolds and the Duchovny character's inner sadness and longing for permanent connection becomes the dominant theme.I found this series a rather effective critique on the emptiness of the fast-lane L.A. world the characters inhabit and of our insistence on eternal youth which inhibits people growing up to become true adults."
3,its interesting,The product itself is great. I bought it as a gift for a friend. The show on the other hand....lots of drama if you like that.
5,Great Book!,"They say good things come in small packages and it is so true with this one. Good market wisdom never changes and everything in this book still applies today.For those of you who don't know Richard Wyckoff used to have a magazine called ""The Magazine of Wall Street"". In it he would have articles written to teach his customers about the markets and how to trade sucessfully. This book was a part of some articles originally written in 1933 and 1934. It is full of great tid bits that mean so much to sucessfull trading that you can't find anywhere else.He tells about market behavior and the difference between the way an amateur trades and a professional. Also discused is the way the professionals deceive the public with all their retoric. The emphasis is for the reader to learn on his or her own to make the best decisions without the influence of others. It is a great book for anyone who wants to learn more about investing or trading. I would call it a must read."
5,"Substantive, intelligent book",Professor Arzac has written a concise but incisive work on an extremely important topic. Arzac reveals a level of expertise that is unique and provides students and professionals with a book rich in content and information. Well done!
2,OK but very technical,"Overall, the book covers relevant M&A material but it's difficult to read. Coming from a finance background, I was looking for a reference book to be used at work. There are other books that are more user-friendly. Recommendation: get Applied Mergers & Acquisitions from Wiley Finance instead; same topics but a pleasure to read."
1,Waste of time and money,"I am an MBA student and had hoped to gain some insights before an interview at an investment bank. I bought the book, misled by the author's credentials and the many 5 star reviews. However, this book is a DUD. It is facile, poorly written and a waste of time and money. Fortunately I also bought Applied Mergers and Acquisitions by Robert F. Bruner ( listed under ""the buy this book with"" button). The later saved the day!Skip this - get the Bruner book."
3,too many bible versions,Like most Christian books nowadays they use too many different versions of the Bible so that they can pick and choose which scriptures really are the right ones... because some bibles have the wrong ones while other Bibles say exactly what they want... but they don't want you to know that the bibles they are using are flawed in some areas.
4,Family devotional book,"Josh McDowell's Family Devoions is a great way to start the day together and has given us another avenue to talk with our kids about different situations in life that they may face. What my wife and I like best is that there are back to back stories that focus on the same topic, from different circumstances or angles. In doing that, it allows us to focus on a subject for a couple of days in a row and soak in the lessons instead of just briefly thinking about it and then moving on. We like this devo book!"
5,Enjoying it!,Our family is enjoying this book. There are many subjects that we are glad to see in it! Our kids are 5 & 7 yrs old and this book is reinforcing the things we have already taught our kids.
5,Great personal time with the wife,"This has been a great resource for my wife and I to spend even more time talking about the deeper issues of life. We have been having some really meaningful discussions. Get it, its a good one!!"
4,I like it but...,"I would have loved this devotional if it had the ""prayer section"" more in depth however as for my family we are enjoying it."
1,very useable for firewood,who is barney groves??????........and who are the supposedly national and world champions he presents in his book?????as one who had been involved in powerlifting since it's inception as coach.....international referee.......and a 5 time world champion........i find this book to be a joke......mr groves may have meant well...but i find the book to be a piece of junk...written by a no name author ...giving incorrect information....using made up national and world champions to promote a book that teaches nothing........i guess anybody can make money on anything today in the good old u.s.a.it does my sport a great disservice to present information like this to the general public......the book should be rated as a comet not a star......i.e falling to earth and burning up is it's best chance of being useablerickey dale crain
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book to add to my general knowledge of powerlifting. It was extremely basic and utterly useless to anyone who has some knowledge of the sport. I hoped to gain information about training methods and routines, but the book did not deliver. The book also contradicts itself on many occasions. At one point, it claims working the calf muscle will not increase power, yet later it gives information on calf exercies to supplement the squat."
4,practical advice for aspiring powerlifters,"This book contains sound, useful advice, and it is appropriate for drug-free lifters.Furthermore, the author is a middle-aged man of average potential, not an ultramesomorphic superstar, which makes his suggested methods apt for the majority of prospective trainees/competitors. Those who are contemplating powerlifting competition will find the book helpful, but ""home gym"" trainees who seek only to gain muscular strength and size can also benefit."
3,O.K.,ok this book was good but they tried way to hard. plus the sex scene with alex and perter i think it was was way too long
3,A bit of a tedious read,"Some parts of this piece are very reflective and enjoyable. Other portions I found a tad heavy going and overtly intense. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you find the subject-matter appealing, or have a special interest in this genre."
4,"Interesting, intriguing, insightful","This book is a very interesting read for those very interested in the details of the history and life and times of Gautam Buddha. It is part travelogue by Pankaj Mishra, his life, interest in literature, simplicity of life, family background and part historical story telling.It is an interesting piece of literature who admires Buddha for which he has done extensive research (about seven years) and has gone to the places where Buddha attained enlightenment and other relevant places.It is definitely a must read."
3,A Little Too Much...,"I enjoyed Mishra's The End of Suffering; however, as others have commented, the book would have been improved simply by leaving out a lot of the philosophical material, especially in the last third of the book. Is it really necessary to show links between Nietszche, for example, and the Buddha? Do we really care the David Hume's philosophy comes near to that of the Buddha? These sidelines detract from, rather than aid, the author's argument for the timeliness of the Buddha's message. However, I did really enjoy Mishra's discussion of Kashmir and Mashobra, issues which the author seems to have a much more personal and interesting story to tell."
2,less interesting than hoped for,"I first heard of The Buddha in the world durring an interview of the author Pankaj Mishra on NPR. His interview was fascinating discussing what I felt was a subject that could use a freash approach. I picked up the book soon thereafter and tried to get into it. The subject interests me very much but mr Mishra never engaged me. His personal stories and his dry historical accounts were forced. It almost seemed like this was writen as one would a pre-graduate college paper on an assighned subject with mounds of reference books close by. the book has but little continueity or flow. I was dissapointed, but maybe my expectations were too high. Even as a history book I would look elsewhere."
4,Read all Three,"This is the third book in the trilogy by Carole Mortimer. Again she pleases with twists and turns and a happy ending. Our heroine's story has been going on since the first book in the series. She is pregnant by the man she loves, the only hitch: He loves her mom!!! But wait there is more: Her mom is DEAD!!! Yes the Ewww Factor possiblities are quite high, yet Carole Mortimer manages to disable them (Thank goodness!!!). As usual there is a big misunderstanding between our hero and heroine, which does'nt get resolved until the end, when everybody else has already figured it out. But the dialogue between the sisters, father and spouses is as usual lively and entertaining."
4,2 stroke power.,"Great book. I have been porting 2 strokes for a lot of years and wanted to get some ideas from others, so bought the bike and all the concepts are the same but he does do a very good job on engines and making power with the newer bikes."
4,an excellent anthology,"The Female Experience is a marvelous anthology of women's voices in American history from the colonial period to the twentieth century. Most of the sources are short - no more than 6 pages in length, which lends itself well to ""reading on the go."" As a reviewer has earlier pointed out, women of all social strata are represented here, which is also a strength. However, I was dismayed by the fact that the vast majority of the selections are by whites - African - Americans, Asian - Americans, Native Americans and other groups are not well represented at all, which detracted from the book's merit as ""the Female Experience."" In spite of this minor point, it is fascinating reading."
1,Just The Facts Mam,"This book is not for everyone that's for sure. It seems to have an exhaustive list of words that it covers but it doesn't give you any details of their meanings. Although it very briefly, and I do mean breifly, defines a few words it seems to be more of a thesaurus than anything else. Also there are no graphics at all. Not so much as a drawing. So if you want more than wham bam thank you mam then look elsewhere. Other than that. Go ahead and have fun. Knock yourself out."
1,disappointed,"The original works of James Strong are excellent, however in the case of some of these newer books where Dr. Strong's work has been ""corrected"" are not so good. Corrected means shot full of errors. For example, I understand that many believe in the rapture, however the word rapture does not exist in the Bible, it is a work of man. I was so disappointed to see references to rapture in a bible dictionary because belief in the rapture alters the entire understanding of the New Testament. If I were given the option I would have given it a 0."
5,Beautiful bag -- great buy,"This bag is a nice, large size -- great for weekend trip or for several days on the road. The leather is beautiful (I got black). I like that it does not have a lot of outside pockets, as that gives more volume inside the bag. The leather is beautiful, and the shoulder strap is strong. I ordered mine from ebags, and they shipped very quickly. I am VERY PLEASED.Note that the dimensions are 25' X 14"" (not 24"") X 10"" as described in ad. It is an ideal size."
2,"Flimsy, cheap, and the rim hurts your lip","These cups are very cheap, so I wasn't expecting much, but I don't think they were worth buying.The plastic is thin and flimsy, so if you fill it up with something to drink, you kind of have to squeeze the cup to keep a grip on it. The plastic around the rim is rough and hurts your lips when you take a sip.I've been using them for cleaning and I threw a few of them into the car to use as pee-cups on long road trips. They excel at that."
3,Catherine of Siena,Quite tedious in reading but for religious history or women's history nice to have published. I have enjoyed the authors\'s other books much more for style.
2,DOn't waste your money,"I don't believe everything I read, and much of it does NOT line up with the BIBLE.It's interesting, but not enough to finish the book. HERESY!"
5,sensational read!,"This book is exceptionally well written and very insightful. If you want a great introduction to this saint, read this."
5,WOW! This song just blew me away!,"Who is this talented woman and why haven't I heard more of her work? That was my first thought when I was listening to the radio a few months ago and heard this song. I have searched for it and the artist ever since. When I found it on Amazon.com site, I felt like I just hit the jackpot! Beverly is an incredible talent who deserves the big push! The lyrics of this song are just beautiful, and how many of us nearly missed out on love when it was staring us right in the face? And to combine those beautiful lyrics with Beverly's incredible voice? It just gave me chills. Most of today's music fails to include something as pure as love, and that's what this song is about. I'm looking forward to discovering more of this woman's work! Beverly, keep up the good work. You just got yourself a fan for life!"
1,Don't buy from Amazing Plush,My sister ordered this and another Toy Story doll from Amazing Plush back on December 15th. They toys are still not here -- so no present for my sister to give my kids for Christmas. Don't believe them when they say it's in stock.
1,Overpriced SMALL plush,"For $16 this was sad. This plush is the SMALL version. The Disney store sells the 16"" version for the same price. This version goes for $8.50, which was verified by the tag left on the toy. My fault for not doing more research. Look elsewhere"
5,Love Bullseye,Got this for my son. He loves it and so do I. Very cute and wellmade. Had it for several years now with lots of play and still in great shape.
3,Bullseye plush toy review,Not as big as we thought. It is a fine toy. We were just hoping to get something more like what the movie inspires.
1,Up to you,"Thought i was getting one that at least Jesse would fit on, well maybe if it was a midget Dont get it"
3,Compelling content - Flawed execution,"This was a book I had been looking for for a long time. The content will be a treasure trove of ideas for those interested in office programming.However...(This relates to chapter 7, the first chapter I jumped to)The code as it is in the book will NEVER work. Even though no errata for the book are listed, the code in the book differs significantly from the code available for download from the apress site. So I changed my code to reflect that. This fixed some of the bugs, but others remained.Not until I changed the code to call the correct database column names (which are mismatched in the book AND in the downloadable code) did the webservice work.Who proofreads these books anyway? This doesn't exactly instill a lot of confidence in apress books. Not exactly $39.99 well spent.A book I might still recommend to others, but only because it's the only book of its kind available right now."
2,"Lots of promise, no delivery","This book delivers neither plot nor any particularly exciting illustrations (little nudity, no sex). The combination of vampires and eroticism has so much possibility. Unfortunately this book completely fails to capitalize upon it.The only reason that this book ranked two stars rather than one is that the illustrations are reasonably decent quality."
2,a huge dissappointment,"i expected a half way decent storyline, but found out after the first few pages this book was nothing more than pictures of nearly nude to nude bodies. i'm declaring the artwork fabulous but that isn't the reason i purchased this so-called book. if you expected (as i did) to read about a love story involving a vampire. save your money and forget THE lADY AND THE VAMPIRE."
2,Nice title; but where's the Romp!,"There are two ways to create an adult graphic novel: 1) Non explicit but well written and humoristic (like some Manaras). or 2) Hardcore, nothing is sacred (like Von Gotha, Taylor, and most everyone else). Anything in between will fall flat on its face and Lady & the Vampire proves it. Here's a title that in spite of providing great art lacks greatly in delivery. Most of the comic is just an excuse to show naked sexy bodies (male and female) with the potential for sex (which is never REALLY executed). There's way too much posing in this comic. This is a teaser that never goes off and leaves you hanging. So unless you're into nudist colonies, don't bother."
5,Gorgeous!,I was immediately attracted to this line. The pieces are unique designs and the pattern beautifully attractive (reminds me of shells). The quality to me is exceptional for the price. This is the first piece of this line for me but it won't be the last.
3,Meh. But watch it for the swing,"For the stuff that really stands out in the feature, there is some serious downtime. Just the first song is a real drag that almost demands to be fastforwarded. I knew ahead of time that I wasn't going to like some of the sequences in this film. However, I love the Benny Goodman piece ""Now that You've Gone."" Its so upbeat and surreal, its really great stuff. I also thought ""All the Cats Join In"" is worth watching immediately (its the second song).Essentially, i bought it for what I felt I needed to have. I wouldn't pay $24 for this movie though. try and find it cheaper somewhere else."
4,Make Mine Music's Missing Melody,"The picture is beautiful, the stories wonderful. All of them that is except the one they left out. I was extremely dissapointed to find the short ""The Martins and the Coys"" was not included on the DVD format. If they had room to include two Silly Symphonies and an entire Mickey Mouse short, why not include the whole movie. I hope we don't see a trend established."
5,Timeless and Classic Disney,"My 6 year old daughter heard the music for Peter and the Wolf and wanted to know what it was about. I immediately recalled the Disney cartoon version and looked for it. It is one of several musical pieces on this video. Needless to say, when we first watched the disc we went straight for Peter and the Wolf. Afterwards, we watched the remaining and it just took me back to my childhood watching the Wonderful World of Disney. The music and artistry of the animation are just timeless. Although it is a transfer of old film, the video is just as clear as any new animation on the market. As they say, the proof is in the pudding and frankly my daughter's interest in the video is proof. This is an awesome collection of Disney shorts that I would recommend to anyone!"
3,"Some visual highlights, but overall, a pretty poor film","When it was first released in theatres, this film was known around the Disney studios (and by Walt himself!) as the ""three M's movie: Messy, Maudlin, and Miserable"". It hasn't improved much since then, and is now even worse, having been edited for ""taste"".The artists at Disney were in a bit of a storytelling slump here; even the film's best moments are pretty weak. ""The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met"" is entertaining, and the singing is marvellous, but it's really a downer of a segment. ""Johnny Fedora"", the tale of a lovelorn hat, and ""All The Cats Join In"", a sock-hop segment, pretty much round out the visual highlights of the film.It's ironic that the supplements on this disc are so excellent. ""The Band Concert"" is regarded as one of the finest animated shorts ever made, and ""Music Land"" is a Silly Symphony classic. These two shorts, together, are far better than anything else on the disc."
2,Peter and the wolf was done wrong,Ok there are some points I love. This was my first introduction to the poem Casey at the bat for example. the whale who wanted to sing at the met always made me smile.However I must say while I loved the vivid coloration of it and seeing Peter and the wolf Disney sensored there too and took an enormous liberty. In the orriginal story the duck was swallowed whole. Leaving it a sort of bittersweet victory and proving that this wolf was a dangerous animal. I guess it was to keep from tramatizing kids but Sasha the duck comes out of a hollow tree at the end. Making it both lighthearted and goofy. Plus the duck and the bird were not friends and while Grandfather deep down was probubly proud of Peter he had his more adult and practical view in the original writiting of it of what if Peter had not been sucessful what then? I really wish they'd left Peter and the wolf as originally written. Kids won't understand that version if they're fed the sugar coated one.
1,Sick and violent part,"Watch out for ""The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met"". It starts out as a sweet story about a whale who can sing opera and dreams of performing on stage. He swims up to a boat to sing for a famous conductor, who brings him to the Metropolitan Opera, where he's a big hit. That was when I left the room for a minute -- only to come running back when my kids started screaming. It turns out that the performance part was only a fantasy, and what happens in the next scene is that the guy on the boat harpoons Willie, and he's killed under a blood-red stormy sky with scary sound effects. Then the narrator says ""Don't be sad, surely he went to whale heaven to sing with the angels"" and that's the end. My six-year-old couldn't stop crying. What a dirty trick to play on little kids. I suggest skipping this chapter if your kids are troubled by that sort of thing."
3,Defective Product,"When I received the package containing my purchase, I opened it carefully.I noticed the magnetic ""Security Bar"" was loose in the bottom of the box. When I performed an examination of the product, I found a scratch on the playing side. When I played the CD it would skip on of the selection of Casey at the Bat. I am very unhappy with this product."
1,make mine music,"It was very dissapointing purchasing this DVD. The listed time is 75 minutes, but the film is cut down to only 67 minutes. The first segment called THE MARTINS AND THE COYS, a story about a hillbilly feaud, has been edited from the film. The transfer is absolutley beautiful, but if you want to collect this Disney classic, buyer beware, you are not getting the actual film, but an edited video version."
3,boring for a three year old.,"I purchased this because it contains peter and the wolf, casey at the bat, and Johnny Fedora Alice Blue Bonnet. Great but the other shorts are dull and boring. I wish I had spent my money on a different collection. I can't keep my little girl intrested in this one."
5,Buy it simply for THE MARTINS AND THE COYS,"An UNCUT version of MAKE MINE MUSIC was released by Disney Sverige (Sweden) on a Region 2 Disney DVD which has all 10 parts including THE MARTINS AND THE COYS.Although Amazon lists the Region 1 DVD at 75 minutes, the actual packaging states that the movie is 67 minutes.The Region 2 DVD is 75 minutes long and is the UNCUT version.You'll need a multi region DVD player to play a Region 2 DVD.And you can buy this DVD at dvd-shoppen.com"
4,Classics and oddities,"My 2 and 4 year old love some of the segments on this dvd. Their favorite is ""Peter and The Wolf"". Some of the cartoons are more abstract, artsy, pre-Fantasia fare. They enjoy some of those, too."
4,Great for kids,"I recently bought this for my 3 year old daughter who loves the disney classics -snow white, bambi. She loved it right from the first viewing. Even my 16 month old sat still for one whole 'short'. I attribute the success to the music and the creative colourful and diverse shorts. It changed often enough to keep them interested and the 3 year old in particular loved the music.If your kids like music I think this a great choice. My 3 yr. old has bumped snow white and declared this as her 'favourite movie' so that says it all!"
3,Don't be fooled,"Overall my son and I enjoyed this DVD. The quality is even better than the original release and they just don't use music in cartoons like they used to. However, don't be fooled this Peter and the Wolf version has been severely truncated from Prokofiev's original. I conduct orchestras for a living and assure you that the music, narration, and storyline have been substantially altered and shortened from Prokofiev's original. While Disney's productions have helped to expose a wider audience to classical music, I feel it is worth mentioning that they unapologetically alter the composer's creation and then present it as the original. Fantasia has similar artistic compromises throughout. I suggest the more recent release of Peter and the Wolf by Sting and conducted by Cladio Abbado if you are in search of a more accurate representation of Prokofiev's work."
4,Make Mine Music,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,What happened to the original version????,"Playing the movie, we discovered to our great surprise that it is not the original 1946 movie but a recently modified version with few missing parts, including the main reason for us to buy it for the first place...Does the sensor cut Disney's animations too?!"
2,"Average entry, shameful editing","This is an average Disney film, filled with an almost equal amount of interesting and ho-hum segments. This would be enough to merit a 3.5 star review.However, it has been shamelessly edited from the original to remove a segment about feuding hillbillies with guns. This is a gross example of policital correctness run amok without any intelligence behind such a decision. Absolutely disgusting."
2,rather disappointed,"As a collector of Disney videos, I needed Make Mine Music to complete my set of the animated features (37 at this time). I was disappointed with the fact that it has been edited. I understand that portions which were acceptable at the time may not meet modern standards, yet these movies are representative of the era in which they were created! I contacted Disney to find out if and when a complete version of this movie would be available and never got a reply. That was extremely aggravating also. So, if you are a collector, be aware that this is NOT the original version of the film."
4,A timeless classic,We bought this DVD for our 6 yr old granddaughter and she loves it. The songs and story-lines are easy for her to follow. Who knew? Not every media piece has to be filled with sex and violence.
5,A Great Surprise,I was thrilled to be able to surprise my husband with this product. He had been reminscing about childhood years and this particular brand name so I googled and sure enough Amazon had it available. He's still using it nearly 2 years later. It's great to be able to find unusual items so quickly and easily.
4,the sims,My kids have been playing this game every day now and they really enjoy it thank you for having it so cheap.
3,This game was fun... but not with the Sims 2 out n about!!,"I thought that this game was the best game in the world until its sequel hit stores!! This is a great game, if you're talking 2001, 2002! Get updated!! SIMS 2!! AND SIMS 3 IS COMING OUT IN FEBRUARY 2009! So you can imagine buying ""The Sims"" when ""The Sims 3"" is going to be on shelves!!!"
2,Don't buy for kids,"The game sounds fun and very innovative, but it is very addicting. My 23 year old daughter has it and it causes many family fights. Her stupid ex-boyfriend bought it for her and it uses up too much of her valuable time. She is a senior at a major university and I think she is studying, but I check her laptop and the game is playing. She's really mean and cranky when she wakes up at noon and I suspect it's because she played it for most of the night. I hate this game. People need real lifes- not fantasy computer, simulated ones. Buy it for your kids at your own risk."
5,Sims...how cool!!,"The Sims is the most funnest game I've ever played! You get to create a family, build a house, get jobs, control your family, and decorate your place in just your style. After you've gotten used to this game, buy one of the expansion packs to add other options to your Sims' lifestyle. A great gift, and a great game. THIS IS A DEFINATE BUY!!"
5,A Must Have,"I love this game! Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time! I could play this game all day and not get tired of it! Parents, don;t let the rating ""T"" scare you away. It says the rating is for ""mature sexual themes"", but the worst thing they do is kiss. There is always more to do on this game, so you never get bored. If you are looking for something you can break out when you need to kill some time, this is the game for you."
4,Old time,I got this because I played it a lot when I was a little younger and its just like i remember! Condition was great and came pretty fast!
4,Good game,"Good game, and better with unleashed. You should really get it if you LOVE simulation games. Also try The Sims 1 and The Sims 2!"
3,"Good Introduction, But Get Your Meat Elsewhere!","In my humble opinion, Hybels has written what is a good introduction on becoming a real Christian. The book consists of about 200 pages and 14 chapters on different areas: marriage, money, evangelism, effective service, parenting, emotions, and other areas.The book is a good primer for someone who wants a deeper walk with Jesus Christ. However, if you are looking for something with more substance, I recommend reading A.W. Tozer, Charles Spurgeon, Andrew Murray, Watchman Nee, Dwight Moody, Charles Stanley, C.S. Lewis, Charles Swindoll, Henry Blackaby, Ian Thomas, and others.If the book creates a hunger for you to go deeper with Jesus, then the title has served its purpose. However, I would not recommend that you stay content with this title and instead pursue titles by the authors already mentioned."
5,Finally! An honest approach to authentic Christianity!,"Bill Hybel does a wonderful job of providing a step-by-step approach to authentic Christian living. I was utterly amazed at how easy it is for Christians to go from ""keeping it real"" to ""real phony"" from one moment to the next. We experience it every day, in our churches, in the workplace, and yes, even in our own homes. If you sense God's call to ""come closer"" and desire to live a life that will allow you the freedom to walk in love with Jesus on a daily basis, this book will provide you with the proper tools for building a solid, loving and HONEST relationship with God, others and yourself!"
5,"Honest to God, yourself and those you love.","This book is about learning to see the human sinfull nature, how it behaves and what to do to go against it. It's about being real in a fake world. It's about going against the flow and daring to care enough about yourself and others. It's about facing who you are and growing above your weakness. It's about learning to love unconditionaly. This is a great book by a great man of what much can be learned from(both his good things and his mistakes)."
5,This book is required reading for the devoted believer,"Bill Hybels always manages to reach me where I live, and his practical advice on being honest with yourself, being honest with God, finding time and methods to pray, study God's word and journal has helped me immensely in my daily walk. I only wish that this book had been written and I had been made aware of it when I was a new believer.Besides an NIV Bible, anything Bill writes, but particularly this book should be required reading for disciples."
1,An Inauthentic commentary attacking the Church,"As with all of Hybels other writings, the concepts are shallow and unchallenging. Hybels fear of ""offending"" the reader lead him to write how he teaches, a watered down, powerless gospel. It's interesting he recently interviewed Bill Clinton live at his church. Hybels believes Clinton to be a great leader and example for other leaders to follow. This book is not worth the paper it is printed on!"
3,I need more scares!,"I know you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but the cover of a book is the very thing that grabs my attention, which gets me to turn the book over to the blurb on the back. I liked the blurb on the back, but the story itself disappointed me. There were chilling parts that I DID like, but there weren't enough of them for me, and some of the character's actions were downright wimpy (for lack of a better word.) Then there's another character who's so mean and vile, but I don't think it's ever revealed WHY? Then there's the ending. It's a twist I didn't see coming, but once revealed, it left a bad taste in my mouth."
4,A horror that plays on all our fears...or memories!!!,"I really enjoy the way Morris writes (having read 'Toady' and 'Mr Bad Face') and this book was no exception. He cleverly makes you care about one of the characters in this book and feel compassion and horror like the other one.He succeeded in horrifying me on the simplest level without the need for blood and gore.It was one of those books that you just have to keep reading even though you're shattered and know you need to sleep, just to find out what happens. The ending was an interesting idea and wasn't at all what I expected."

5,Excellent but small,"Excellent for capuchinos, helps pour the coffee in the cup without mess. It is great for transparent cups because it pours nicely against the edge of the cup so as to keep the coffee from mixing with the milk.Only setback... it just holds a regular shot dosage, will not do for double shot capuchinos."
5,PERFECT!,"These were exactly what we were looking for and they shipped to Hawaii too. So many sellers don't. They are the perfect size for individual cream pitchers.They seem well constructed, yet simple and attractive. We are using them in our restaurant. Will likely be purchasing more as they would make excellent syrup pitchers too."
5,excellent book of photography from anis to apartures,"Wonderful book. Ever wonder how to make film developer in your basement? Great tips on picture taking, exposure, etc. Everything you need to know is here. Teaches you all the things you should know before buying that new Nikon N-90...from a very elementary level."
1,Do Not Buy This Unauthorized CD!,"Fans of Janis Ian,Please refer to... before you buy this unauthorized Festival cd.Janis herself has termed this an unauthorized release on the message board at www.janisian.com.(7/30/02) Ms.Ian notes that she has been trying to negotiate with Festival for eight years to no avail.Choosing any of Janis' other fine cds will guarantee a rewarding listening experience.My personal favorites include ""god & the fbi"" (2000), ""Stars""(1974), and ""Between the Lines"" (1975).Peace,JP"
3,Is Tyranny the best policy?,"With the rest of the reviewers I have to highly recommend that reading the first three books in this series is essential to fully grasp their nature and purpose. In this one (Vol.4) Hope Hubris has assumed total command of Jupiter and is attempting to institute many overdue changes in the governmental and societal structure of Jupiter. Through a heavy dose of satire and allegory Piers Anthony is able to demonstrate and spotlight many of the problems in our own political and social structure.Although this book is not as fast paced as the previous ones in this series it is still a highly entertaing and thought-provoking look at how the best intentions and ideas can become buried in bureaucratic quagmire, and the lengths (and sacrifices), Hope must go through to accomplish his goals. In the end the book does make you wonder if perhaps a tyranny is the best form of government."
5,geneva 11 in wood clock,"they were very accurate with the descripition of the clock and was delivered to the house sooner then we thought it was great it was on time for a birthday present,as well!!!!!!"
2,Couldnt finish..,Book started out really slow and i had trouble getting into the grove of it. I never got more then half way through..
3,"Not Great, But OK","This is the second book I have ready by Mark Billingham and while initially I like them by the middle I find they drag, I have already figured it out and the ending is just anti-climatic."
2,Writing too choppy for me,"This was the 2nd book from Billingham that I have tried to read. The first I found a little hard to follow at times but I thought I would give him another try with this book. I have found the writing style to be a choppy and not very smooth. Very frequent change of settings/characters to the point where I find myself having to stop and back up often to try to re-establish the setting and try to figure out who the character is that I am reading about. I think the last straw came last night when in one chapter the settings/characters changed at least 6 times and I do not mean going back and forth between 2 settings .... I mean 6+ different settings with different characters, with only a paragraph or 2 dedicated to a couple of them.I understand these books are very popular but I, myself, prefer smoother prose."
3,Scaredy Cat,"Content ok but style of writing is often times confusing. The switching of conversation, thoughts of the characters, and jumping from character to character without some sort of break tends to loose the reader."
2,scardy cat not my cup of tea,"i guess this book i do not enjoy, maybe if i read more of this authors books it will be better"
1,Couldn't finish this book,I'm sorry to say that I was unable to keep an interest in this book. I abandoned it after about the fourth chapter and just moved on.
1,"Slow moving, boring, etc.","I stopped reading this book after 40 pages. It was slow moving, too much personal background on featured people, no action, etc."
3,Slow moving character rich suspense novel,"DI Tom Thorne is faced with solving a series of murders. It appears that women are being killed in pairs. Two separate killings are occuring at the same time in and around London. The killers apparently kill in tandem in that the means of death are similar. Thorne must catch them before they kill again. The key is to find out who they are and what drives them to kill.SCAREDY CAT being a pure psychological suspense novel is one of the more disappointing reads of the year. It is packages as a highly suspenseful and fun serial killer novel. However, rather than plot or pacing, the emphasis is on characterization contained in a slow, meandering quite ordinary police procedural. To add to the sense of disappointment, when the true identity of the killer is announced, I scratched my head in bewilderment in that I didn't recall him previously. To his credit, Mark Billingham manages to create full, rich and memorable characters. I just wish they moved a bit quicker."
3,"I trusted you. You, the reviewers with comments...","And was let down. I'm new to reading (I was more like ""I'll just wait for the movie"" type) and love a great thriller, but this wasn't one of them. I respect the Brittish, but I still don't understand lots of their terms and meanings, so I got lost in that a lot. I like the characters in it, Thorne, McElroy, and Holland, the story just didn't move me like I want thrillers to do. I'm now reading another highly reviewed book, ""The Vanished Man"" by Jeffery Deamer. It's scaring the bejesus out of me so far, so maybe you the reviewers aren't that bad, and I'll just blame this one on me being the ""New reader guy, who doesn't get it"". =)P.S. I do agree with one of the reviews about the epologue...it really was sad, but good."
2,Hardly any plotline,"There's hardly any plotline at all, not to mention the bad quality of the picture."
2,Not worth the money...,"I purchased this movie partly because it was a american indian produced film. The acting in this movie was bad. I can appreciate a low budget movie, but the acting is what makes the movie. Hopefully the next project will be a better effort."
4,"Critiqued all elements with a hearty, ""Gob Well Done""!","Dollar for dollar Ms. Mullins squeased a lot of production value out of her low budget. This was NOT a multi-million, big budget Hollywood movie folks, it was a 'blood and tears' low budget production! (You get big points for that alone.) There were a lot of strong plot points and well developed characters driving the storyline along. Should we name you the female version of Robert Rodriguez? Keep at it lady!"
4,Well done first film. Beautifully filmed.,"This beautifully filmed movie is very well done for a new, upcoming film maker.The gorgeous location scenes are full of life, the story line is noble and the lovingly passionate attention to the time period detail is evident.The Director has great potential and by purchasing this adorable DVD, you facilitate and support her hard work toward a promising career!"
1,Extremely disappointed,"Hair Rats - 10"",8"",6"" . I was really excited when I first saw the hair rats on here and decided to buy all three. Each Rat cost $8.95 an okay cost but then they charged me an additional $6.65 for each rat for shipping and handling making the grand total $46.80. $46.80 for three extra large curlers..hmmm. I would of thought because of the cost of shipping the parcel would of being here in 3 days but did not show up until 16 days later at which time I did not need them. Thanks but no thanks..."
1,WHat's the book about?,"I've been going through a list of 'must reads', and might have considered this book, if I only knew what it was about."
3,Not what was expected,"THought the movie ""Angel and a Badman"" was in color but it wasn't. It was the entire reason for the purchase"
2,I CAN'T TAKE THESE SONGS ANYMORE !,"He history in this follow-up is cleverly written. But the trouble is when Pocahontas sings (what happens all the time ! ): it breaks the action completely, it seems more like Mariah Carey screaming, it's a total waste of the plot."
2,The original one was way better,"It's is fine movie but the production quality is so bad, I don't like the story. The original was way better. Do not buy this movie"
2,Eh.. Not so great.,"Like nearly everyone else, I was not impressed with this movie at all. My nearly 3 year old loves Pocahontas and will sit thru the ENTIRE movie over and over but was bored within 30 minutes of watching this. To be honest, I was over this movie from the beginning. In the first one, Pocahontas spoke normally and in this one she sounds like she is just learning English. That just annoyed me throughout the whole movie. The ending was disappointing as well."
3,Better for Kids than Adults,"To rate this movie fairly, I have to include both my opinion and that of my 3-year-old daughter. To me, this film is pretty bad. The original had great animation, great music, and a moving storyline. The sequal has average animation, mostly bad music and a convoluted storyline that tries too hard to balance fact and fiction regarding the true story of Pocahontas. BUT, my 3-year-old daughter, who loves the first Pocahontas as well, likes this one just as much. She likes the fact that Pocahontas goes to England and gets all dressed up in a ball gown, making her look more like the other Disney princesses. My daughter also doesn't seem to mind the lame jokes and the weird storyline that has Pocahontas winding up with someone other than the ""prince"" from the first movie. So for adults like me, I'd rate it 2 stars. My daughter would probably give it 4, so my official average rating is 3!"
3,Not as good.,"The quality of this movie was very good. However, the story and music just don't stack up to the first Pocahontas movie."
3,This Movie Is OK! The First was WAAAYY BETTER!,I do not dislike this movie. It could have been put together better. The songs were ok as well. The first song was the best and that was it... I think it is just an OK MOVIE AND COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER WAY BETTER! THANX!
2,Not as good as the original.,"I liked the original movie...I was not impressed with this sequel. And neither were my girls, ages 3 & 4. They began playing and not even paying attention to this movie about 1/3 of the way into it. It was an okay movie - but rent it - don't buy it!1smileycat :-)"
2,Unbelievable. . .,"Shame on Disney...As if Pocahontas I wasn't historically inaccurate enough! It still surprises me how she manages to fall OUT of love and fall INTO love like an absoulte moron. Whatever happened to John Smith? They turned him into an idiot with a boat, in other words...Leo DiCaprio! And Rolfe was admirable -- considering Billy Zane did his fabulous voice -- but unless you're a die hard Zane fan and want to hear him sing the theme song ""Between two worlds"", FORGET THE NI-QUELL MOVIE!"
1,Another Awful Disney Sequel,"Okay, Pocahontas loves John Smith. End of story, no more discussion. Unless you watch this movie, in which the entire relationship the Disney animation team struggled so hard ot bring to life in the first movie (and the ending: All she had to do was take a visit to England, apparantly.) is destroyed. Anyone who loved the original should not watch this sequel."
1,That movie was pathetic!,"When I first heard that Disney was making a sequel to Pocahontas I was really angry because I KNEW she would end up with John Rolfe and I didn't want that to happen. I BOUGHT the movie being the idiot I am and I was throughly dissapointed! John Smith was voiced by someone else and seemed completely heartless and everyone wanted Pochontas and John Rolfe togeather, and she was so mean to him since the begining of the movie. John Smith looked so much older and gross in this movie! I hated the songs and that stupid cook that took care of Pocahontas! This movie is really bad, no wonder Mel Gibson wanted nothing to do with it! There shoud be a lable on the cover of the movie instead of Pocahontas' ugly mug that reads: WARNING: Prepare to lose all respect for Pocahontas and Disney sequels!"
1,Not a very good movie,"After watching the first Pocahontas movie I was excited about seeing the second. But, it was awful, almost depressing. my kids didn't make it through the first 15 min. before they were bored. Too bad you can't return movies after you've opened them because this one would have gone back!"
1,Not worth the paper she was drawn on,"Historical inaccuracies aside.....was there any need for a second movie?Frankly, this is right up there with Sister Act II as far as unnecessary sequels go.If I were you, I'd spend my afternoon or evening going for a walk or reading a good book instead. You'll appreciate the memories.That's all."
3,At least it is somewhat historically correct :),"I don't see why everyone who didn't like the movie is getting so bent out of shape over Pocahontas choosing John Rolfe. That's the way it is supposed to end. Don't get me wrong, I love the first one, but in history Pocahontas was like thirteen when she met the thirty-ish John Smith. She did not fall in love with him. I was disappointed about the way they ended it though. It wasn't dramatic enough for me. It kind of seemed like she was settling for John Rolfe, when in fact she was in love with him. Oh well if I had to choose between Mel Gibson and Billy Zane I might have a difficult time too."
1,Do you people not know history?,"Both part 1 and 2 are terrible. Disney did not follow the historical accounts of pocahontas, by the way didn't you people know that she married John Rolfe, it is a true story. In history John Smith had no part between Rolfe and Pocahontas. Terrible, terrible movies especially part 2. I might give part one 2 or 3 stars."
3,Not a bad sequel,"Let me start by saying that our family loves the original Pocohontas video. When I first watched Pocahontas II, I was extremely disappointed to see Pocahontas wind up with John Rolfe. What happened to John Smith? Then I went back and reviewed my history and was reminded that Pocahontas DID in fact marry John Rolfe. While Disney often plays fast and loose with the historical facts, they did get it right on this one. Overall this is not a bad sequel."
4,good movie,"This movie is just as good as the first, in my opinion but the love story changes into a love triangle for a little bit etc. it's worth buying if you have the first one."
3,Straight to video indeed,"The quality and story line in this video was noticeably under what one expects from Disney. But the kids enjoyed it so maybe it's a kid-moly movie. Nothing too bothersome, violent or upsetting, even for my 5 year old."
1,Terrible Beyond Belief,"I am a hardcore fan of the original film and this cheap quickie to make some cash off the original was both misguided and awful. Terrible songs, terrible script.....ugh. Where to start? This may be the worst Disney sequel EVER and that is saying something! I am not going to tread the same ground about the story that has been covered 200 times already. Just avoid this at all costs. Please. Do if for the children. And if you love the original ""Pocahontas"", do it for yourself."
1,Why can't they have a 0 star rating?,"I'm 16 now, and I remember most Disney movies with that warm, fuzzy feeling. I was at a friend's house and noticed Pocahontas and thought, I haven't seen that in years! Let's watch it! Then she said, We both remember the first one. I think we have the second one somewhere, let's watch that! So, we popped it in, and stared in dismay as it got worse...and worse...and worse. The history, for one, destroyed it, since I tend to like accurate things. Then, Smith comes in and the other guy(Rolf?) is heartbroken. Mmm hmmm. And Pocahontas saves Smith in the first one, and chooses Rolf in the second, and Smith WALKS AWAY like nothing happened? Take human nature into consideration: he would NOT have been so peaceful. Well, I guess if the kids didn't see/didn't like the first one, they'd like it. I personally hated it with a passion. Don't buy this. Rent it or borrow it. Please."
1,Shattered dreams,"This ruined everything about the first film for me. For one, they turned John Smith into a total airhead. I mean, what happened to the brave explorer?? I wouldn't have minded about John Rolfe { In turth, she does marry him.]if he was not such a boring...sorry, I can't swear on this site. Pochontas had a total character change and she had NO IDEA what she was talking about. The histoical methods really needed to be rethought. It lacked PASSOIN and ADVENTURE and was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Pochontas lacked her free spirit and John Smith his noble heart. Trust me, I am only 13 and I saw this a few years ago and it shattered my dream and my heroine. I cried at the end, for petes sake. So, if you don't want shattered dreams, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM."
2,Not so bad but not so good either,Basically the movie wasn't so good as I espected it to be .I mean the first movie was way much better I could say the Pocahontas 2 discussed me .The hole thing of the movie was that she stays with John Smith and finally she ends up running with another guy that was much more uglier than John Smith .The cartoon is pretty well realizes the characters looked somehow the same as the ones in the first movie but the context is very poor .So if you really want to enjoy you're Fridays don't choose Pocahontas 2 because it will leave you with a sour taste in you're mouth .
4,Pocahontas 2,this film is great. Historically it is a little inaccurate. However it is a very well done disney film.
3,MUCH better than the first.,"Okay, so I'm really not getting what people are complaining about with this movie when they liked the original. Our family HATED the original...found it really boring. But, overall, we really liked this one. I wouldn't put it right up there with Nemo or Monsters, Inc., but it's really cute with a fun storyline, and they straighten out the historical inaccuracies a bit from the first one. Granted, the animation is along the lines of a Saturday morning cartoon, but try to keep in mind that this was a ""straight-to-DVD"" production that was never meant to hit theaters. All in all, I think this is a worthwhile DVD, and our 3 year old LOVED it, including the Hiawatha short in the Bonus menu."
3,Good and Bad...,Well it certainly doesn't live up to the first Pocahontas but it wasn't horrible. The animation could have been better and it certainly could have been longer but I think any Pocahontas fan should certainly rent Pocahontas II at least.
2,ABSOLOUTELY CRAP!!!!,"The first movie was lovely but this one spoils it! The story is awful, the songs are unbearable and the new characters are okay. But John Rolfe ruined it. I thought Pocky [Pocahontas] loved Smith. Quotes: Pocky ""No matter what happens, I'll always be with you forever"" NUH!!!! She goes and runs off with this gay guy Rolfe, even after she finds out John Smith was alive she takes Rolfe home with her. Not at all the magic of the 1st! I also prefered the places in the 1st, not England town!!!LATT2 was a wonderful sequel, and TLK2!!!This film was ABSOLOUTELY CRAP!!!!!!!!!"
4,Is love in the cards?,"Every time Lee and Joe make plans for a romantic night or something special to do, it seems someone is out to get them, after the town annoyance is found murdered. Is someone framing Joe for the murder?Someone sure has it out for him. It was comical to read and I loved the parts about chocolate. Made me crave it!This is a cozy mystery to read and you will enjoy it!"
4,Great Series,"Each installment of this series is getting better, and it's turning into a really enjoyable one to read.Lee's ""tongue-tangling"" is still very annoying and seems more and more forced and not the least bit funny. It's time to do away with it completely. And I find the parenthetical descriptions of each chocolate every time one is mentioned annoying as well -- give us a recipe or let the name speak for itself.I look forward to the next installment."
1,What a waste of time,"This book was a complete waste of time. Dale Carnegie's organization has gutted his classicHow to Win Friends & Influence Peopleand replaced it with a fluffy and useless ""The Leader in You"". They make some references to Carnegie's seminal work, but remove most of the meat to leave room for ""inspirational"" quotes from ""important"" people. The only nice thing I can say is that it was relatively short. Stick with the original."
2,Predictable and Uninteresting,"There are lots of much better books on the subject of leadership. For example, read ""The Leadership Challenge."""
1,Stories may be good but audio/video is horrible,Disney did absolutely nothing to restore these enjoyable two shorts. The audio and video are so bad you might as well buy the VHS version and save yourself some money.
3,LOVE ICHABOD NOT SO MUCH MR. TOAD,LOVE THE ICHABOD STORY NARRATED BY BING CROSBY. MR. TOAD I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT.DISNEY HAS ALWAYS PRODUCED QUALITY FAMILY ANIMATION...THIS IS NO ACCEPTION.
1,Terri38,I was very disappointed when I received this movie. It looked to be in great condition but it would not play and so i had to send it back.
5,Past is now the present,My great-niece of 22 yrs.old wanted this for Xmas. I watched this on TV when I was 10 yrs.old many years ago. What a treat it was watching my family viewing Ichabod and the Headless Horseman. Thanks for a great Christmas.
4,That Ichabod story is awesome!,"My teacher gave us a day off from our schoolwork one day and showed this to us and that was a real treat, I liked both but I especially liked the The Ledgend OfSleepy Hollow story, Mr. Toad was okay but a little boring compared to the Sleepy Hollow cartoon, everyone in class liked that story and they would constantly say we want to see Ichabod especially the boys they were always bugging the teacher to show Ichabod to the point where I'm sure it drove her up the wall but it was a great story and I highly recommend this on DVD or video. I had no idea that Bing Crosby did the narration for Ichabod, I'm a big Bing Crosby fan so I think that is so cool!"
4,I LOVE IT....,"It is great to see these stories finally on DVD. Coming from the mini-classics section of Disney, they used to be shown on the Wonderful World of Disney and other Disney specials on television. Now it is possible to see them crisp and clear for the first time on DVD. The color, sound (Bing Crosby's crooning is awesome and Basil Rathbone's voice is wonderful)and picture quality are all great.The DVD includes a chapter list of each special. The only setback is that you can not choose which show you watch first, only through the chapter list can you do so. There are some cool extras included, like the cartoon Lonesome Ghosts, and a DVD storybook of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Also included is a Mr. Toad trivia game and a sing-a-long song.I was very pleased with the way Disney put this out. Classic stories mixed with solid, sharp picture and sound, make this viewing experience and walk down memory lane a positive one."
2,ichabod and Mr. Toad,The movie was a little boring from what i remembered as a young kid. Mabey there is a better movie like it.
5,Mr. Toad and Ichabod's Wild Rides,"If you are a Disney fan, like moi, you'll love this. Some people with a short attention span would say it's not ""deep"" or ""plotted"". But any Silly Symphony lover has to simply adore the characters and the wonderful sense of nostalgia defined by this video. I own it, I love it. There is so much to say for it. Bring it to your family! Mr. Toad is so cute and so is the Mole, and I'm a reader and I've always liked ""the wind in the willows"", so I have quite high standards. See this movie."
5,Great Family Fun!,"This Walt Disney classic is so much fun to watch! I remember it from my childhood and I recently purchased it to show to my fourth grade students for Halloween. I thought that it might be a little dated for today's kids to relate to, but my fourth grade students loved it.I especially love the Legend of Sleepy Hollow and the chase scene is one of the funniest cartoon segments I've ever watched."
5,Best Halloween Movie,"I'm not the biggest fan of The Wind of the Willows. (I never saw it as a child.) However, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a classic I never get tired of watching each year around Halloween."
5,Great Disney Classic,"This is a wonderful Disney classic for all ages. You can't go wrong with vintage Disney animation, especially narrated by Mr. Bing Crosby!"
5,Still A Classic,"This timeless classic is still fun to watch.I remember it from when I was little.I hope now my daughter will get to say the same thing,cause I'm gonna watch it with her time and time again.Ichabod cracks me up on the last few minutes of the movie when he's being chased by the Headless Horseman.That scene makes it worth watching.The Mr. Toad cartoon is pretty good too.I had never saw it growing up,but yeah it was pretty good.I'm a sucker for the good old classic Disney Movies like this one.The animation is still awesome ,even compared to today's cartoons.I prefer this to the new computer generated junk.I wish they would only do a remake of Sleepy Hollow though,and make it a longer movie."
5,Good Halloween Movie!,I loved watching this movies while I was growing up! It was one of my favorite Halloween movie. I let my children watch it for the first time this year and they loved it!
5,Classic,"Disney's Ichabod still reigns as the best. Bing Crosby's melodious voice is pure delight. This DVD is autumn viewing at its most glorious. Simply classic, a must have for the Disney fan, or addition to any Halloween film collection. The other reviews say it all. Gorgeous, sentimental and always a joy to watch."
5,Alexander Mjagkikh,"Did you buy this book? No? Do it? You will find everything you want to know about your favourite band. You will see first steps of Depeche Mode.I have been waiting for such a book and now I am waiting again, but for the second volume. Thank you."
2,Some Lesser Read,Dave Thompson's writing is a bit thin. The book lacks depth and it just a quick magazine style tell. It gives you the basics but lacks any real insight.
5,perfect texture,Blended in to the existing texture of the wall that I patched perfectly. It just looks like someone put a lighter color of point in the spot. If the color matched you wouldn't even know it was there.
1,Waste of money and time,"I bought Nads and it was a mistake. I had to try it on my eyebrows five times to get four hairs to come off. It somewhat worked on the bikini area, but it was more painful to me than waxing because it tugged more, and it didn't CLEAN the area up like waxing, there were still hairs in the spots I used the Nads. Messy, and unreliable. I tried it because if it worked, would be cheaper than wax, a warmer, new strips...but it was just a waste."
2,"I did not like this product, save your money!","I tried nads and found that not only was it messy, and got everwhere, but it also hurt and did not remove my hair. I grew the my hair on my legs for 2 1/2 weeks before trying it to make sure that it was long enough to work. It did not stick to my hair, but still hurt very badly when I ripped it off. Unless your hair is thick and bushy like a man's it does not work. I usually dont try stuff off of infomercials, and this is why."
2,OUCH!,"I bought this item with high hopes of easy hair removal, and I was very disappointd. I found the product impossible to use on the bikini area due to the pain involved, and I wouldn't even use it on my legs! The only area that I ever used it semi-successfuly was on my eyebrows. I would never buy this product again, and I laugh with my other friends who own this product when we talk about our experiences with it! The only good thing is that it is virtually odor-free and the after-lotion smells very good!"
1,THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!,I purchased the Nad's Hair Removal Gel to remove hair in my underarm area. I followed the directions carefully but it didn't work at all. It just made my skin all red and irritated.
1,hello?,"O.K. First of all, anytime you pull hair from your body - it's going to hurt! Bearing this in mind, I bought this product thinking maybe it would hurt alot less than other products I have tried. I was WRONG! I think someone should sue them for false advertising. I followed the directions to a T, keeping the skin taut, etc. Also if you don't want it to look and feel like a cactus is permanantly in your crotch, DON'T do your bikini area! *WARNING* DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!"
1,Buyers Beware!!,"This is one of the worst products I have ever bought. I put the sticky stuff on, and I peeled the stick stuff off and hair was still there, plus it hurt a lot! Then it got really messy, so I stopped using this. If you've seen the informercial, you see them eating Nads. That was the only Good thing about this product, it tastes good!"
1,More pain than effective.,I used Nad's several times to give it a fair chance. It never actually took the hair off unless it took some skin with it. I would rather shave every day than use this product ever again.
1,It doesn't work,It was given to me as a gift and it was awefull. It left me with sticky hair on my legs no matter how taught I pulled the skin!!
1,It works on some people,This product does work on some people. I think really skinny people. Of which I am not. I did pull out a chunk of hairs on the one area I could pull really taught and they didn't grow back for months. The rest if my legs sadly just stayed sticky.
1,Crappiest Hair Removal Product Ever!!,"I can't believe how anyone can buy this product a second time. There's nothing special about Nad's, it's regular sugar wax that does nothing that the it claims it will do. It hurts like hell! it's messy, Lot of Muss and Fuss. There's nothing special about it, it doesn'e even remove the hair completely. Bad Bad product. Don't waste your money on it. Even the one star rating that I had to give it is a lot. It's worst than that."
1,Ugly video transfer,"This records is so badly made, unsharp, without contrast that itspoils the film: it is made for the trash. Stay away from this production !"
3,I saw it when it was new!,"When seen years ago this movie was shocking and wondeful. Unfortunately for those who see it for the first time like this it will not impress them as it is so hard to watch because of appalling quality of reproduction.Sofia gives an incredible and believable performance as the southern Italian peasant trying to survive the last days of the war with her daughter. The rape scene is harrowing. The subtitles are amusing..once it even gave a sub-title when they hadn't said anything!! This movie is really for someone who knows southern Italy well and experienced WW2 (as I did to some extent) and also is fluent in Italian as you would have to be a very quick reader to keep up with the inaccurate subtitles. See it just for Sophia,s magnificent performance!"
1,Avoid this terrible version of this great movie..,"I ordered this version in hopes that it would be a better release than the previous sub-par versions out on DVD, and I was extremely let down. The video quality is very blurry and everyone looks fuzzy, and the audio is dubbed over in English, instead of the original Italian with English subtitles. I recently watched this movie on TCM and the quality of thier print of this film was over a hundred times better than this copy. Don't be fooled into buying this extremly disappointing release."
4,"great film, lousy copy","This is a wonderful film about a mother struggling to preserve the safety of her child in war-torn Italy. The acting is absolutely superb, and the young JP Belmondo is a great surprise. The mother leaves Rome with her daughter for the bomb-free countryside, where she finds family and hides. Of course, it doesn't work out that well, first for danger and hunger, then their fate at the hands of rogue soldiers. The end is tragic but hopeful, as a new society is set to arise.Unfortunately, the quality of this dvd is extremely mediocre - fuzzy images, muffled sound, etc.Recommended for the art but not for the technical execution."
1,JUNK!!! This movie deserves much better!!!,"Sad,sad,sad!!! What a great movie!!! But what a crappy DVD!!! SLP vhs tapes look better. A complete waste of money!!! This film deserves much better!!! YUCK!!!"
1,Good Movie - Bad DVD,"One of the main reasons I bought this DVD was that I was under the false impression that I could turn off the subtitles. The technical details list English subtitles as ""available,"" which to my way of thinking means I should be able to dispense with them if I so desire. Not the case with this DVD. The subtitles are stuck on there. I use these movies as language teaching tools, and being able to turn off the subtitles is a major improvement over video tape. This DVD does not do it for me. The technical details on the other DVD edition ...provide even less info.Other than that, this is a very powerful movie, though the picture and sound quality on the DVD are poor."
5,Sophia Loren...YUMMY,"Mrs. Loren who is still a sex symbol at her age, was the first actress to win an Oscar for a foreign language film with this movie. The story is simple and elegant. Loren and her daughter, played by Eleanore Brown have to leave Rome becuase it is being bomed by the Allies as it is occupied by the Nazi's. The political situation is messed up and Mussolini is overthrown. The Nazi's send in troops to meet the Allies at Salerno and a 21 day battle ensues (you can watch a great movie about this battle in A Walk In The Sun).This movie isn't about the war tough, it's about these two women surviving all of the horror that comes along with it. These Two Women (La Ciociara) endure hardship and horror but make it through together. The only drawback to this film is that most of the spotlight is on Loren's character while the rest of the movies actors are in the background.The Bonus Feature is pretty good also. The poster gallery is a plus."
4,Powerful.,"Two Women starring Sophia Loren is a explosive foreign language film. Loren proves she's more than a sexy woman, she won an Oscar for best actress for this movie. The transfer is my only gripe, the tracking is horrible. The subtitles and story are easy to understand. This film has a rape scene but nothing is shown, powerful and raw drama. I highly recommend it."
2,two women,"I know this is an older type movie, and of war torn Italy,but it has such poor story content. And the way the mother treats the teenaged daughter like a two year old is very hard to swallow. The area it was filmed was very accurate, and the little bit of historcal content was fairly accurate. I'm just happy that I didn't have to pay a high price when I purchased it."
1,TWO WOMEN,"The movie is great, however, the copy is very really fuzzy to the point sometimes is hard to watch.The reason I did not returned is because I would have to pay for the postage, there is no place in your comments to explain why you are returning it."
1,Two Women,"An excellent film with a great performance by Loren. However, this print is terrible. I would not recommend purchasing this edition."
1,BAD DISC,I had a bad experience. When I tried to play this DVD I got an error message that the CD was not readable. It is no good!
1,an unwatchable transfer,"I checked this Madacy Entertainment release of Two Women out from the public library. THANK GOD I didn't waste any money on it. This release is just horrible: The transfer is blurry, the sound is poor, the titles are blurry. I jumped ahead a few scenes to see if it was this way throughout the film. Yes, it looks that way. don't waste your time or money."
1,Two Women,This is an excellent film and one of Sophia Loren's very best. The quality of the recording was so bad I could only watch a few minutes of it before tossing it in the trash. It's unwatchable and should not be for sale and I would reccomend no one buy it until a better quality recording is made.
1,You get what you pay for!,"The quality of this particular video is, in a word, LOUSY! How could any fan of the lovely Sofia Loren stand to view this blurry piece of garbage? What a let down. I demand a refund......"
1,"Great movie, terrible DVD","This review is about the DVD by KOCH Vision.Oh, boy! The movie is of 1961, but I have seen better quality TAPES by early Charlie Chaplin. Not just KOCH spent no time cleaning and re-mastering the original, it also seems that they have used the worst original available. On the top of it, the box says it's black and white - what a lie! It is, actually, green and yellow. What else? I could not move further then the scene 8, then the picture stalls, surrounded by yellow squares.My advice - do not buy this one, just waste of money!"
2,"Great movie, horrible DVD","The movie is beautiful, but (as all other reviewers mention) the DVD is almost unwatchable. The image quality is awful, and the subtitles actually are **ridiculously inaccurate** (I AM Italian, so you can believe me...). And I couldn't even turn them off, so even if you speak Italian there is no way you can avoid being bothered by them!! The sound is very poor too. Even for an Italian, it's not easy to follow the dialogues, and it's not because of southern accent, it's just that the sound is awful. But, after all, it's cheap, and nowadays you can't expect a good DVD for such a low price..."
1,two women,This is a great movie but the quality of the print made it impossible to watch. I have not seen a movie in such horrible condition. Amazon should really try to watch it then discontinue selling it...
1,Warning - poor reproduction,"""Two Women"" is an excellent movie, but this DVD reproduction is poor. Looks like a fourth generation reproduction. Very disappointing. Sorry I bothered."
1,A Pallid Disgrace,"Charles Baudelaire, commenting on the scabrous obituaries of Edgar Allan Poe in American contemporary press, asked ""Is there no by-law in America to prevent dogs from entering cemeteries?"" One might well ask the same of the producers of this disgraceful DVD. It does no justice whatever to Vittorio De Sica, Sophia Loren, or anyone who wishes to see this film with its plenitudinous glories intact. This DVD should be banned for its unparalleled stupidity."
1,Two Women,"Two Women (La Ciociara) [VHSDO NOT- I REPEAT- ""DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE"". Don't Waste your money. I purchased the vhs tape. It is so bad that I could barely see the images. Also, there are tracking waves throughout the movie. The AD stated that it was NEW. ""THAT WAS A BIG LIE!!!"" The tape is in Italian with English sub-titles. I am going to throw the tape away, and not waste my time sending the horrible thing back.!!! The big insult is that I paid $6.49 for the Tape, and $4.98 for shipping. WHAT A LOOSER THIS MAKES ME OUT TO BE!!!"
5,The Lion of Griffindore,Used as a mascot for Summer Olympics. Well received as a mascot. The team did well.
1,Terrific!,"And I don't mean amazing - for me,that was a big big disappointment. No portraits of players (these few words,that's really for nothing). NO deeper STATISTICS !!! (and that should be the book about NBA ,where stats are so interesting). A lot of themes,but written in a smattering way. I have only one counsel - don't buy it,it's good maybe if you don't know anything about NBA, but if you are a real fan,you won't find there anything. Good money thrown after bad ):-(. Thank you for nothing,authors."
2,broke immediately,this bracelet is very pretty- but it broke after only a fews days of wearing it. too bad!!!
4,Got it,"It is a book that I received in a timely fashion. The book was a little more beat up then I expected, and there was no protective cover to it like in the picture. but the books are good."
2,Huge disappointment,"I purchased this book expecting accurate statistics on a variety of parameters such as births, deaths, murders, divorce, marriage, etc., THROUGHOUT the history of the United States. I discovered most of the data only goes back 40, 60, or at the most 100 years. The book should be retitled ""20th Century Historical Statistics of the U.S.,"" or, more accurately, ""Historical Statistics of the U.S. Since 1960."" Interspersed with the scanty statistics are the predictable assortment of pro-big-government, collectivist, statist essays from an array of rarified academic types. The 5-volume book is now moldering on my shelf. On the upside, would be great for pressing flowers, stopping doors, dropping on roaches, etc. Thank God I got this used, for about 90% off the list price."
3,GREAT SINGLE,This is a good single Youth of a nation is good Alive (semi-acoustic)is GREAT if u like insturmental songs listen to track 3
3,classic western,A classic western of its time. takes you back to when you where a kid dressed up like your favorit cowboy. the actind leaves somting to be dasired though
1,Deserves no stars!!,"Worst movie ever made,... if you've actually found this review & listing,... then you know what I'm talking about. WORST!!!Low even for the career-less Fred Williamson. Horrible DVD transfer, no extra features, mind-numbing to sit through...can't believe it's actually real.stay away from it!"
2,Not Historically Accurate,"I bought this movie for my daughter who is 2. My daughter likes it, but like The Little Mermaid and Cinderella she prefers.The story is good and about following your heart, peace, and nature, but it's entirely inaccurate. The Algonquian Indians that were native to Virginia during that time placed women as the chiefs. This means that Pocahontas would have been the Queen (she was). Her father would have just been a hunter/soldier (he was). Pocahontas was the Queen of her tribe during John Smith's visit. I was very disappointed that Disney did a poor job of using sustainable historical details. I think the story would have been better if Pocahontas was the Priestess.Also, the land that John Smith landed on was not mountainous. I'm from Virigina/DC and it's flat land from the Chesapeake Bay for some 90 miles West until you reach the Blue Ridge Mountains."
5,Nothing else quite like this!,"Wow, how can my review do this album justice? I haven't heard anything quite like this so here goes... imagine a really good international music compliation album shattered into a blender with two parts Tom Waits, one part Camper Van Beethoven, then pour it into a tumbler of Ouzo, served up with a twist on a remote Greek isle. That starts to come close to describing just one song from this soon to be lengendary album. You should get this just to find out if you have taste or not. Because even if, incredibly, somehow you don't immediately fall in love with this album, it will undoubtably become a huge collectors item in time, so at least you'll be making a wise financial investment you soul-less robot."
2,Too big for any chair I've seen,This pillow has perfectly good construction and design but its size makes it unusable in a standard office chair or car seat (even in an SUV).
5,Well Documented!,"At last, a Black Dahlia book with plenty of photos, illustrations, and source notes. It even had an index! Wolfe's book is well researched, fascinating, and it has a great deal of new information. For those who are interested in the true story behind the Black Dahlia murder this is a must read.Lorenzo Matawaran"
3,I don't really agree with this book.,"I don't agree with this book because I don't believe that the mob did her. I am bit disappointed with this book. However, I give 5 stars to the photos inside this book. I like the photos because it is more of true thing. I get closer look at the photo to give me a closer look at this case rather than the story itself. If you are a Black Dahlia fan, then collect this book anyway, like I did. I am Black Dahlia fan, and I like to collect them."
2,I wanted to read about Black Dahlia but I got All these Unrelated Stories....,"Well, I was really really undecided whether to get the fictional version of Black Dahlia or this book. Then I figured, I wanted to read about facts. So, I chose this book instead but it was a disappointment. Not much about Black Dahlia but all these other stories about Bugsy, etc. It was interesting to find out about the LAPD, corruptions, and the newspaper companies at that time but all I really wanted was the story about Black Dahlia. So there, I thought Mr. Wolfe was all over the place and not really concentrating on the main subject matter of this book...."
5,Intense page turner!!!!,"The Black Dahlia Files: The Mob, the Mogul and the Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles, was the most intriguing read! If you enjoy history, conspiracy theories and murder mysteries than this is the book for you!!!! From page one you are guaranteed to get a first row seat to the mystery of ""The Black Dahlia"". Throughout the book you will get to follow author, Don Wolf, into the deep dark world of corruption in Los Angeles."
2,I was disappointed in the cd.,"Yeah I was seriously disappointed in this cd. I had been looking for this cd and finally found it and when I did, I wished I could have my money back. I probably like 2 tracks out of the whole cd and I even play it to see if I can get into it but I cant.The truth is Joe Lopez needs Jimmy Gonzalez to resurrect his carrer. They can get back together to make the Best MAZZ cd ever if they were to reunite."
2,Am sorry Joe But This Is Not Tejano!!!,"Joe since you lost Jimmy damn manyou went down the hill.1st album was awesome2nd nothing like the 1st it washorriblethis new one by Ab.Quin...Its notMAZZ, Its not Tejano, Mazz is notCumbias for everysong, I dont reccomendthis cd. to any1 unless your ready to takea BIG MAZZ TURN thats not tejano...Am sorry Joe Lopez i use to love your music but nowi see Jimmy Gonzalez Is the real Mazz and you need himback!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Tejano And Proud"
1,Thing sucks...and not in a good way.,Tried this out on hardwood and tile floors. Was displeased at the lack of power this thing has and ended up returning it.
1,not a good product at all,this little vacuum just makes lots of noise. doesn't pick up well and i can't even feel the suction at all
5,If you like houston rap -this is a must have,Every song is great. The beats are amazing combined with great deep lyrics. must have
3,should of been better,This cd would have been alot better if crime boss would have rapped more on it. There are only a few songs worth listening to.
4,IT'S A NOVEL.,"This book is well-written and interesting. It will absorb your attention and it's rarely dull. On the other-hand its style reminds me of the W.E.B.Griffin Action-Hero books. Everything and everyone in the book is ""too this"" and ""too that."" The book is autobiographical. Krekorian depicts himself as the best there ever was...Best Surgeon, Best Commander, Best Husband, Best Friend...Best (fill in the blank). Everyone in the book is a Superhero or a Super-villain. There is no grey. I wondered for a moment if Krekorian and W.E.B.Griffin were separated at birth, but discounted the idea when I further reflected that Krekorian probably had the perfect childhood. But it's not a bad book if you like W.E.B.Griffin, and I don't question the author's basic honesty. There likely are mortals like Ed Krekorian out there in the world...somewhere."
3,Nice touch to a party,"We purchased 3 of these serving trays for displaying food at a Alice in Wonderland party. They look great however as they are made from a rubbery plastic, when we cut the food items on the tray the paint seemed to come off. Can't be sure that the paint is food safe as nothing is mentioned in the listing. Unfortunately we spent quite a bit on these 3 trays and postage to Australia and they can't be used again due to the scratches where the paint has come off. Overall happy with the purchase but just keep in mind that it is a disposable item."
3,Tons of useful information; But some is out-of-date,"Have a question about your visit to the Grand Canyon? It's probably answered in this book.I got this book while preparing to author a DVD Hiking Guide to the Grand Canyon (now also available on AmazonJon's DVD Hiking Guides - Grand Canyon National Park) to make sure that I wouldn't leave essential information out of the DVD.This book answers just about any question that you might have, and while perusing the questions you are bound to say ""Yeah, that is a question I would have before or during my visit.""Very practical and useful; but a few years old, so some of the information is out of date. That's why it gets only 3 stars."
2,get what you pay for,"I bought these skates for my 4 year old to take lessons with. I figured even cheap skates would be better than those horrible rentals. They are but not by much. First, I bought 2 sizes bigger than her shoe size (and one size bigger than the rental skates)thinking they would last a little longer that way. Thank goodness I did because they just fit! She wore them for the first time today at lessons and the ankle support of one of the skates has already started to collapse. Part of me is not surprise, but I had hoped they would last longer than one hour of skating!"
4,Size runs SMALL,"I ordered these for my girls for Christmas. Based on the reviews I ordered as size 1.0 for my child who's shoe size was a 12 1/2, and a size 3.0 for a shoe size of 1 1/2. ORDER them several sizes larger because they run VERY SMALL. The size 3.0 fit a shoe size of 12 1/2."
1,Not very good,"I have to agree with the ""dud"" comment, because I got a copy of this and thought the stories were either dull or of amateur quality. This can't really be what women are thinking, at least not the women I know who are vibrant and wildly sexy."
2,A mediocre 2003 volume,"I've liked these books in the past, but this one fails to inform or entertain. It's not terribly awful, just not very good. The writers are average or below average, and for a ""best"" anthology, that's not good enough. I wouldn't pass this book on to anyone, and that tends to say it all."
1,Disturbing!!!,"I was shocked to read some of the ""fantasies"" written for this book. I was sickened by the references to violence (not just hard-core sex, but flat out violence,) and the arousal of one of the woman when she saw another woman fall to her death. I am by no means a ""prude"", but I am really shocked at how disturbing this book is. I told my husband and a few girlfriends about some of the stories and ALL of them were stunned and, quite frankly, a bit grossed out. If this book is any indication of what our society is like, I am scared for our future.Sick stuff."
5,Best Tela Album,"To me, This is by far Tela's best effort. My favorite cut on the album is Twisted. I can put this cd in and let it ride out until the last song with out skipping any tracks. If you don't got this one, go get it now."
5,"A great rap/ hip hop album from ""da dingy dirty south""!!!","Unlike a lot of southern artists, Tela is able to walk the thin line between hip hop and rap. Dont get it twisted, this album is more southern flavored than anything but you will see some hip hop references in there. Check out ""Strange"" with Crime Boss and the magnificent lyricism of Mr. Mike, who is a very highly underrated rap emcee. The songs are on point ranging from ballin to pimpin women. While these subjects may be tiring to many, Tela flips them in a way that will make you realize how creative and original he is. And I know all of the hardcore hip hop headz will love it when on the intro to ""Twistedd"" Tela states ""Let's rock. Dedicated to the kings of hip hop....thank you."" (Know who he's talking about?)"
